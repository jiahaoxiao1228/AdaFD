82147,0,"My experience trying the chocolate flavored Balance Bars was one I don't care to repeat! I followed the instructions on the package to drink a glass of water with the bar and the water was the only way I could swallow it! The taste of the bar was very chalky and dry and truthfully, the thing almost made me gag! In all fairness to the product, it did keep its promise to satisfy my hunger and sustain my energy, but unless they can find a way to improve the flavor, I'll never touch another one! If you can stomach the taste and texture, than it may work for you, but I don't recommend this particular flavor of Balance Bars. Perhaps another flavor would be better."
115888,1,"i only wish that they made a bigger size!!!!! my boyfriend and my girlfriend have both tried this product and they loved it as well!!! For Christmas, I hope I get a Welch Allyn KleenSpec 586 Series Disposable Vaginal Specula. I know my dog will be getting one!"
315483,0,The pen worked okay. It was not as good as what I had before but I didn't see any other choice.
85621,1,"i've been taking this particular fish oil for several months and I am extremely satisfied with the results I've been getting, i.e.: no more dry skin, better brain function, less joint pain, more energy, etc. Seldom experience after taste, seems very digestible. I'm really disappointed Amazon is not carrying this product anymore. You had the best price and often times free shipping if I bought over $25 worth."
316354,0,"I purchased this also for my wife. However, the &#34;Easy Dose 4 A Day&#34; version has worked to her total satisfaction. So she gave this to her mother for her management of multiple medications on a daily basis."

316128,0,"I still haven't been able to master how to use this device (the Fat Caliper) with any degree of consistency. I've had it about a month now. But my trainer seems to know exactly how to use it and gets accurate measurements with it each time. So apparently, once one has learned how to use it properly, it will aid quite well in measuring your body fat percentage. It's easy enough to read - but it's the actual measuring that leave a lot of room for error."
3789,0,"Of course its easy enough to ignore the plethora of research saying this stuff is beyond bad for your liver but what really takes the cake is the fact that many people [not including myself] think it tastes downright awful. Me and my friends drank this tea and while the first one or two cups were tasty, I found one of my friends complaining of how disgusting it was while the other one threw up several times. While my experience was marginally good, I can't say i would endorse this product."
5174,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.

288512,1,"I love this little battery organizer! I had no idea how many batteries I had on hand until I rounded them all up and put them in one convenient location! Sturdy, well designed and what a super price! Highly recommend it if organization is a priority to you. :)"
6026,1,"Had this for nearly a year now and works AOK, matches Doctor's figures so excellent useful item. Not cheap, but a case where paying a little more is a good idea, health control is vital.Took a bit of time to learn how best to work the monitor but since then, easy to use. NOT A TOY, a real quality machine. If you need to check blood pressure regularly at home, this is for YOU!"
73530,0,I purchased this product in hopes my hair would grow longer it seems togrow very slowly in the back probably due to lack of vitamins or because I do dye it occasionally. I have noticed growth not very much but at least 2inches over a 4-5month period of taking this and now that I have run out it's slowing down. I reccommend this product but I am open to suggestions on one that works much quicker than this.. It's okand I may try it again.
314178,1,These fit my girlfriend's wrists just fine and finally allow her to sleep at night without waking up to sore joints! These work as advertisted and are of good quality materials. Highly recommended.
193947,2,i have been trying to return this since I've gotten it and no responds from this company...this was a Christmas present..my daughter already has...and i should have ordered 2..i only ordered one.NEED TO RETURN THUS PLEASE>>>RIGHT AWAY
349900,0,Order was never received. Granted amazon gave me a complete refund but vendor was very slow to deliver and when the product did come it was the container for the brace but no brace. The box that it came in was not tampered with so someone shipped it knowing that this brace was not in the display container and of course they didn't have anymore in stock. I cannot review the product because I never received it but watch out for this vendor.
90244,0,good product just looking for something better. too much suggested capsules. i notice a slight difference in my skin and I am satisfied at least with the results
197668,2,This product should be taken off the market as it gums up your dishwasher so bad your dishwasher doesnt work at all with soap scum everywhere. After several rinses with vinegar it still has the soap scum. We have been washing our dishes by hand and may have to buy a new dishwasher!!!!!!!!!Yes I am very upset about this product as we never had any problems using Cascade.
138108,2,"These knee straps work fine but there is a lot of package information that you need to read BEFORE you purchase this, such as: do not use if you have poor circulation, etc. Also, at the time I purchased this, the sizing information was not available so the strap did not fit; I was allowed to exchange it or refund but I had to pay shipping and handling to receive it and to send it back and I was charged too much for the ""handling"". I have since noticed that these are available at most drug stores and you can avaoid all of the problems that I had."
22053,0,"The items works as described, but the pills are very smelly. This smell is tranfered to your body and skin. You start to stink after taking ghem for a few days."
164286,0,"Ok, so i loved the idea of this being a green product, saving the environment and all, at least that's why i bought it. When I received it I was on the tail end of my cycle, so I tried it. It took a little getting used to inserting and emptying, but no leaks and quite comfortable. Fast forward to my next cycle: Maybe I wasn't inserting/positioning it correctly, because the leaks would not stop. No complaints about the comfort, but I couldn't understand why it was leaking, because when I removed it, it was not full."
23557,1,"I bought this mirror for my bathroom, because of it's longish design, it doesn't take too much space on my counter. The touch control is great as well as the bottom extra magnifying part. I've had this for about two months now and it's still working great. It's wonderful for applying make-up and tweezing."
164852,0,"I usually love Tide, but this one didn't take stains out of whites very well and it has a strong odor of cedar and menthol. If you like those scents, it may work for you, but it failed my stained sock test.The scent is very, very strong. I don't smell it on the towels and some items, but I am rewashing everything that gets close to my nose, things I sleep in or on, etc.The scent reminds me of cedar and menthol.I'll be using the rest of the bottle for things that don't come close to my face.Tide is still a favorite of mine. I'll just make sure never to choose this particular version of it again."
41785,1,"I love this toothbrush! I have had problems with my gums for many years and, at a friend's urging, recently switched from a Sonicare to the Oral B 9400. My gums have never felt better. I haven't been to the dentist for a cleaning yet, but I am confident that my results will be obvious and measurable. [I also added a water-pik (Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet) to my dental regimen at the same time, but there's no doubt in my mind that the toothbrush is the major contributor to my success.] Get yourself one of these, your mouth will thank you!"
100103,0,This clipper didn't cut any better than my $7 Walmart one that was several years old. But it did cut and didn't pull the hair. Plenty of guides for for length.
55620,0,"The straps that go around the legs were way too long. Perhaps just a mistake in manufacture, or perhaps a design error, I do not know. At minimum adjustment, still too long."
167670,0,"My son's trainer was having him drink a breakfast concoction before coming to the gym for his workout, and it wouldn't have tasted so nasty if one of the ingredients hadn't been apple cider vinegar. I ordered this as a gift and had it shipped to my son so he can now follow his trainer's breakfast instructions without gagging. I really don't know if this is beneficial or not, I have not studied any research. I bought a bottle for myself, as well, but probably won't buy anymore for me after this is gone, unless something convinces me it makes a difference."
267979,0,"I have used this product before and though my cholesterol count remains above 200 with or without the product, my hope is that it would be higher without it . Call me a dreamer or a cockeyed optimist, but that's how I feel."
59152,0,"I'm always a bit surprised as to what my Magic Erasers will clean and what they won't. For example, they would not clean dirt off my shoe, but got a red dye stain out of my sink.The other issue I have with them is that they crumble very easily.However, when they work, they work well, and they have saved the day a couple times. I'm glad I have them on hand."
141942,1,"I have been using this henna cream for the last three years. It is very gentle to my hair. Mine is Dark brown "" chocolate "" with premature gray hair. I don't like to see gray hair and I hate to destroy my hair with chemicals. So I started using the henna powder mixing it with hot red tea or black tea to get the color I want. I had to leave it at least 7 hours on my head.. this is when I started looking for a henna that stays only 1 hour and I found this beautiful henna cream it doesn't itch it doesn't burn stays 45 min on hair and then wash. I tried the chocolate, red , mahogany and sweedish blond. the best was chocolate and the worse is sweedish blond because it didn't color anything not the gray nor the dark hair. but the chocolate was the best for my hair.. I love it :)"
426127,0,"It's a great product. I haven't had a sinus infection after using it (and I used to get them at least once a month).However, the attachment broke inside of the nozzle after just 4 months.Masking tape works well if you find this happens to you."
397984,0,"I get the distinct feeling in my eyes that I get when I put pure water in them. It just doesn't feel completely natural to me. I believe the chemical balance is off. That said, this is much better than having nothing at all and definitely better than putting water in your eyes (bad idea). I also find the plastic capsules to be a very odd and bothersome shape. I'd tried their old and new design and they are both awkward and can be difficult to get the drops out of. I also think the pinhole is too small. I always have to use two drops instead of one, as with other tears I have tried. And since the hole is so small, if you leave the drops open for only 5-10 minutes, the exposed drops will react with the air enough to harden and seal it completely shut. So you can't reuse them after only a short time."
135148,0,"If this works the way it's supposed to, it's a great product; but I'll have to wait till November to get my dental check-up results. It seems to work pretty good, but there are a couple of small things that could be better: a) the reservoir is a little small and b) the electric cord could've been a bit longer. It takes a while to get used to using it. I just hope my dentist says it works as good as the WaterPik people says it does. I'll let you know in November."
352653,1,Very good value for a very good skin product. The luminere eye cream works miracles as well.
94848,0,"I used this to advantage, although getting the password was a hassle, and when changing comnputers getting hooked up again almost impossible. Fairly easy to use, and motivating, although it takes a fair amount of time. Frequent weighings can be discouraging. Mostly I was disappointed in paying for something I then couldn't access."
103389,0,"I'm on my second Remington WDF3500 - the first one lasted a couple of years - then the charger stopped working. I contacted the company and they will not sell replacement chargers, so I had to buy another shaver. Now I have two working shavers and one charger.It's important to note that I rarely use my electric, preferring the closer shave I get with a good blade razor. I use the electric if I am in a hurry, travelling, etc., so I was very disappointed when the charger failed.As far as the shaver goes, it is ok, but don't use it on underarms - it is way too rough!! I remember having a little Sunbeam electric razor years ago that worked great, very gentle, etc. Guess they don't make ladies razors like that anymore."
79638,0,I am a long time user of Norelco Shavers but I would like a a light or similar warning to deshow the ideal time to recharge the battery.
291710,0,"I'm very disapointed that the sthetoscope in the kit does not work as well as I spected; you can't hear a thing! , so if you need one I recomend that you should get it somewhere else, on the bright side the sphigmomanometer in really easy to used...."
126651,0,"This product was ok. I'm not thrilled about using condoms, but these weren't too bad. I didn't think they felt any different than others I've used in the past. It's a rubber...pure and simple, and I wouldn't recommend them to family for fear of embarrassment."
212071,0,"My ""repetitive stress"" elbow is improved after wearing it, but it does get uncomfortable after a while and leaves red marks on my elbow. If I adjust it with my elbow straight, it becomes uncomfortably tight when I bend my elbow and my muscles expand - there isn't any give in the strap they use.I am presently using a neoprene strap type elbow support most often, as it expands during exertion rather than becoming a tourniquet."
267525,0,Got this from advice from my massage therapist. I used in in my groin region and hadn't noticed anything. I will keep trying and hopefully update.
352067,0,"Don't be fooled my brother. It's not 99.9% preventative. It's good if you do the withdrawl method consistantly, but once you bust inside, it's over. It's @ 75%, so 15 out of 100 women get pregnant if you use it by itself."
133770,0,I though that this item would be an alternative to floss but based on my few of using it I could say that I am disappointed.
273403,1,"I was very impressed by this product because aside from being a sturdy back pillow it can also be used as a car seat. This is a very comfortable back pillow and can easily be deflated to fit into your bag and very useful for travel. I bought this product to use for my flight to Las Vegas but ended up using it as a car seat because the car we rented did not have an adjustable seat and I was the designated driver! Being short and petite, I always need a car with adjustable seat so I can see better while driving. This product helped me a lot. Well recommended indeed!"
346264,0,"I don't like how it's labeled with ""300 ea""...it should only say ""100 each"". I expected 300 in each box! Also, these swabs are a lot thicker and have a lot more liquid in them, so if you are diabetic and you want to take a quick test, these are going to keep your fingers wetter than normal, so get ready for a sting or let your fingers dry! I normally like perforated packaging so it's easier to tear, but the swab covers don't have the perforation so you either have to cut them or carefully try to rip each tiny package apart."
390501,1,"I bought the Littmann 2201 Classic S.E. Stethoscope for my EMT-B class. We were provided with stethoscopes, but they were terrible quality so I decided to purchase this one after reading the reviews. I can hear great with this stethoscope, even with a bunch of people talking loudly. It is very durable and the price is great, too. I'm also a 3rd year pre-physician assistant student, so I plan on using the stethoscope for at least another three years. Overall, very pleased with my purchase and would recommend the Littmann 2201 Classic S.E. to any medical or nursing student."
293080,0,Received as a Fathers Day Gift. Provides a very good shave with a 1 to 2 day beard. However with a 3 to 4 day beard the shaver would capture and pull individual whiskers. On my shaver the whiskers are being captured between the foil and plastic end caps. I have made this issue known to Eltron and will see what their response will be. Other than the tourture of the whisker pulling the shaver does an excellent job. Hopefully this is a bad manufacturing run issue and not a design issue. I like the shaver enough that I am devising a fix should Eltron not be interested. This is the only rotary (reel) shaver that is available in the USA as it is almost impossible to get the Hitachi equivalent here. Hitachi has a wet/dry version that is very interesting.
316588,2,"This was a complete waste of money. It gives you diarrea for days after even when you dont take the pill. I never took more than one a day, not the 2 per meal as suggested on the label."
26313,1,Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great!
395976,1,"This is a good stick. I love the sheer foundation and thought this might be just the thing to cover slightly redder areas. It is nice, but not great. It tends to melt a bit."
119333,0,"Received this as part of a kit.While it does smell nice, and your feet do feel fresh and clean, it does not remove any callus or build up."
246002,0,"I've lived in Chicago and Atlanta and find the machine a good addition to block urban noise. My dog even seems to sleep sound under the &quot;white noise&quot; option. I primarily use the sound options but have a couple of complaints, although none would stop me from buying another machine. The first is the lack of more sound options. The other is the short cycle on some modes. For instance, on the &quot;Summer Night&quot; mode you can easily hear the program recycle, which quickly becomes annoying. The Aroma Spa is pleasant and adequate for small areas, such as bathrooms. Don't expect much in larger bedrooms. The aroma fan seems to drone and vibrate, overpowering the sound program at lower volume levels. Even with the complaints, I still believe that the Envira-Spa is the best on the market for the price."
302901,0,I've used a lot of silver salves or colloidial silver gels and i don't think this one stacks up to others. It is quite watery. I would buy the ASAP brand over this product.
245505,0,The toothbrush works fine but we received a Model 7400 and not the Model 7550 we ordered. I had to call Amazon to get a credit for the difference in price because returning the wrong unit would have been another hassell I just didn't need. The Model 7400 has all the basic features so we will make do. I will say that Amazon was very good about giving us a credit in a timely manner for the diffence in price between the two units. Guess next time I'll just go to the store and pick up what I need. I paid the tax and shipping charges and it would probably be about the same as the price of gas to go to my local store.
184143,0,"I love using this for my backaches. It is difficult to use because the edges of te heart are very sharp and can really hurt. Its amazing how hot it gets and it feels great but I'm always a little tense when being massaged because I'm afraid of the sharp edges. Also, this is the second one I've owned, the first one popped when I boiled it for the first time.... dont know why. I didn't stab it or anything I just put it in the boiling water and realized it had popped when I pulled it out and it was half empty... anyways, its an okay product."
121044,0,"My other battery operated toothbrushes, around five total, were simply not in the same league as this Sonicare. My teeth actually feel smooth and I was told by my dental hygienist that this was the one to get to help my gums. Boy, does it ever! The only ""squawk"" I have with it is changing the battery. I doubt if I can do what the booklet says and that is a shame. Other than the battery, I love my Sonicare!"
170934,0,"My trouble is mostly with daytime clenching, and I did find this product helpful in that regard - mostly because it was so awkward and uncomfortable to wear, it made me more aware of my habits and did help me to at least reduce the amount of clenching and grinding that I unconsciously was doing. However, I did have a funny feeling that if I wore it too much, the way it puts pressure on just the few teeth that touch the bitepad MIGHT start causing problems of its own - when I took it off, I had that sore feeling that one gets when they have braces and their teeth are moving around - which is not something I want my teeth to do. Overall, useful as a psychological tool and good to wear around the house, but be aware that you can't really talk or anything without it falling out, and that other people can clearly see that you have a mouthguard in. I'm not sure I would want to sleep with it in. I did once or twice and woke up feeling almost nauseous, because it was going too far back in my mouth."
293236,0,"It works well, and I like that it's a wet/dry. It's the second one I bought, mainly because the screens get holes and it's only a little more money to buy a whole new shaver instead of a new screen.It does an adequate job and it's not expensive, I think it's a good value for people like me who are too cheap to spend a lot on a shaver."
391087,0,"I bought these because of my high arches and they're ok. After a couple of weeks they ended up being too soft even with the firmest support in place so I ended up buying another generic brand. The other brand is MUCH firmer but sometimes I don't need that much firmness so I alternate them depending on how my feet feel. If I'm having a lot of pain, I'll wear the Dr. Scholl's since they are softer"
41532,0,"The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9000 performs worse than less expensive Oral-B models. It claims to prevent you from brushing too hard...it doesn't. Brush harder and it continues to run as it normally would. Also, compared to the Oral-B 3d Excel (which is replaced by the Model 1000 so I've read), the 9000 is heavier due to the display and larger battery, and it vibrates slower for a less vigorous cleaning. I much prefer the 3d Excel because it performs and cleans better.You may not want or need all the extra features in the 9000. The large button is the power on/off button, and the small triangular button changes the cleaning mode from Clean(Normal) to Soft to Massage to Sensitive and back. While you're cleaning, the brush does a noticeable jiggle in your hand every 30 seconds and then does a long triple jiggle at the 2 minute mark to indicate that you have reached the recommended amount of cleaning. If you can remember all that or don't need 4 different cleaning modes, then you may want to opt for a lighter, better, less expensive Oral-B model without the display and with fewer cleaning modes."
304564,0,"I really do not understand why oral-b dont just replace the brushes on the head. It will be so much cheaper because the plastic head itself doesn't not get damage, and they can last a long time."
206891,0,"For the amount that you get, this lube is not bad, but nor is it very good. It seems similar to a KY Jelly, except in cream/lotion form. It dries rather quickly and becomes sticky. It does, however, reactivate if water is applied to it, (but during sex, applying water can be troublesome)."
120305,0,I used it on our trip and it worked OK. My bak did not hurt or get tired on our long triad trips. I also use in my work chair. It did work better there.
319574,0,"Great product composition, price, and subscription mechanism.However, the taste is somewhat disappointing.Will not continue subscription"
78532,0,"I bought this machine when my son was an infant, nearly 5 years ago. It has performed well for all this time. The white noise is a steady, soothing sound which allowed us both to sleep with other noise in the house. I like the fact that you can rotate it to change the volume and also the pitch of the sound. But... it's just not the loudest sound machine on the market. It is definitely louder than some others that I've checked out, but not as loud as one a friend has, from Sharper Image. Now that we have even more noise in other rooms of our house than ever, I need more to mask the sound for my light sleeper. Right now I'm using a fan and this white noise machine, but came looking for another one. I may just get another one of these and use two of them in his room."
15234,0,"I liked the chocolate raspberry flavor, but I didn't like the texture."
193969,0,"This lighter would get more than 3-stars if the bottom plastic part would have been as tough as the rest of the lighter. I don't get it... They take the time to make a tough and rugged lighter, but they close off the bottom of the lighter where you refill the butane with plastic. One drop in the urban jungle (on concrete) and the plastic bottom piece is cracked and garbage.Just be careful with this product. If you're gentle on it, then it's for you. If you're thinging along the lines of ""Rugged Outdoor"" like the title says, then find something else."
295488,0,Took this product to my MD for review. He questioned the need takes such a product if no problems exist. I decided my health was just fine without the product.
86477,0,"This shaving set falls under a budget category, and while that isn't bad it isn't on the same level as the high-quality Merkur razor/brush/stand sets you can find from high end shaving resellers.That said, this set's best feature is likely its modular stand. It fits well with its original pieces, however the bar that holds the brush and razor are fairly standard sized and thus will fairly easily hold different brush and razor sets. The included razor seems to be a generic Gillette-type Trac II head with one blade included to fit, and the brush is a boar bristle brush with a dyed stripe across the middle.The razor is good for the beginning wetshaver to start with, a simple, fairly inexpensive double blade razor is preferred in traditional wetshaving as opposed to the newer cartridge razor designs with 3+ blades currently in the market. As Gillette no longer fully controls the patent on the TracII razor blade cartridges, generic replacement blades are readily available for the razor, making it an excellent budget option. The stand should easily hold a single-blade safety razor such as a vintage Gillette Super Speed orMerkur Hefty Classic, should the owner own a better razor already or wish to upgrade as they gain experience. (The metal suspension bar could also be bent somewhat out of line to fit for razors with wider handles.)The boar brush is of decent quality, the steel handle is elegent and feels very solid in the hand. The brush could be a bit longer and wider, but it's enough to get the job done. Again, if the owner would like to substitute a higher quality badger brush with softer bristles and better water-retaining quality, it should fit easily in the brush stand. (RecommendTweezerman Pure Badger Shaving Brushas a starter badger brush)The one major complaint with this set is the included soap, a Taiwanese-made shaving soap under the brand name ""Kingsley"". While sufficent, I would recommend a glycerin shaving soap such asCol. Conks Glycerinor Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap (often available locally), either of these soaps will readily provide a dense, slick, cushioning lather. Other high quality traditional shaving creams can be used with this setup, such as Proraso Eucalyptus Shaving Cream Tube,Trumper Limes Soft Shaving Cream,Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream Jar, or Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream."
315132,0,"Do your research! Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide is 35%, not 12. This might be an excellent product, but it is not what qualifies as ""food grade""."
76701,1,"This is a superb sound machine. Creates a lovely whooshing sound..not loud or abrasive but covers up a lot of outside noise. I sleep like a baby with it on! Highly recommend it. Also, the design is super cute. It looks like a little alien ship."
368661,1,"The big trimmer works well, but I really like the pop up trimmer. I also like the snap on charge adapter."
285351,0,"At 40 years old and after 14 years of marriage, we are trying to get pregnant for the first time. My OB/GYN recommended tracking my fertility as closely as possible, so I purchased the Vicks OviTrack Basal Thermometer.Packaging is good, the unit arrived in working condition. It comes with a plastic case and some disposable covers, as well as a tracking calendar. Instructions were clear and easy to understand. I ""tested"" the unit and took my temperature a few times in a row and each test yielded the same temperature. This unit tracks to the hundredth (2 decimal places) and features a memory function so you can view your last temperature.Now, the two things I do not like:1. No back-lighting. I wake up early, before sunrise, and I cannot see the display. I've even tried holding it up to my alarm clock, but the gray background on the readout coupled with the black numbers make it impossible to see.2. I hate the beeping when it is done taking my temperature. Yes, it wakes my husband and yes, I hate that it does this. I want to keep some ""magic"" in this whole process and not make it soley about baby-making, so keeping some of these ""extra"" things I must do to myself is something I choose to do, and it's impossible when the thing beeps 8-10 times after it's complete. It's annoying and unnecessary and it's loud enough to wake my husband.I am trying to find a way to muffle the beeps, but after a week of using it, I've been unable to supress it. It's not alarm-clock loud, but since it beeps so many times, it wakes him up. It also alerts our 2 dogs that someone in the house is awake and they go crazy until I get up and let them out.Wish I could find a thermometer with all the features this one has, that works accurately AND has a back-light and would let me TURN OFF the beeping, if I choose."
333825,0,"This is the second one of these I have purchased. I really liked the first one but it unfortunately stopped working after only a few months. I do wish the water reservoir was bigger, as I have to stop to refill it halfway through using it."
377452,0,"I am pleased with this except that the brush is difficult to get into the tube. It consists of three pieces: the tube, the brush and a connecting ring that is threaded on one side to fit the tube and on the other side to accept the threads of the back of the brush. It is hard to get the brush into the tube with the bristles toward the closed end. This would allow one to seal the whole thing except for a drainage hole in the base of the tube. The easier alternative is to put the brush butt end into the tube and cap it with the connecting ring. Some of the bristle ends are then slightly exposed. I would like to avoid crushing the bristle ends. I'll try wrapping some wax paper around the bristles tightly and see if I can slide it into the tube. It would have been nice if the bottom of the tube were removable so the brush could just slide through."

The best sources of kelp are Norway, Scotland, and Ireland. The puity of the North Sea and Norwegian sea have a positive effect on quality of its kelp. Kelp is a combination of both macronutrient, (eg. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (eg. Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, etc). In addition, kelp contains cytokinins, auxin-like gibberellins, betaines, mannitol, organic acids, polysaccharides, amino acids, and proteins.Twin Labs produces their nutition supplements under the Nature's Herb brand name. It is no longer producing Norwegian sea kelp, which is the most desired form. Be wary of any sellers who allege to offer Norwegian Sea Kelp under the Nature's Herb brand as it does not exists.

110685,0,"I was looking for an environmentally friendly choice that did not have either a plastic or cardboard applicator. From the reviews as well as the product description, this seemed like a great option. I would have given it a higher rating, however, I find that the outside wrapping, especially when I am in a rush, can be impossible to get off. Once they improve this aspect, I would increase my rating although I will still continue to purchase it. It is comfortable, just as good as the less environmentally friendly products, and a worthwhile choice."
286298,0,"I figured I would give this stuff a shot. I work out daily and have been on a controlled diet for more than 6 months. I have been unable to lose any of the abdominal fat that I carry, despite my best efforts. I decided to give this stuff a go. I work out in a public place, and this stuff reeks. It smells heavily mentholated, which I think comes from emu oil. It gives you that sort of ""icy hot"" feeling on your skin and you do get redness that resembles a chemical burn. I only used it about 1 week and didn't notice any difference, but I couldn't stand to keep using it. My guess is that there is a mild skin irritant just to give you the impression that something is working while, for most people, the exercise causes the real loss in fat."

A little gassy and liquidy for the first week, and I felt a bit more cleaned out, but then it's settled into a routine after that. In fact, things aren't that much different from normal, so I'm not sure whether this stuff doesn't have that much effect on me, or I didn't have that much to clean out in the first place."

Continuing throught my day the remainder pealed off due to perspiration or something. In the end, I just used Krazy glue and it stayed strong for 3 days. This stuff probably only works on cuts that are not on the hands and are not on joints. I had a cut on the joint of my pinky finger. After the initial 10 minutes of burning and drying, it maybe lasted 30 minutes before I bent my finger and it cracked down the middle, allowing more pain and such into my cut. Seriously, dont wast your time with this and just use krazy glue, they both use acrylate polymer."
138882,0,"The good news is that this product works for men too, albeit far from perfectly. It does tend to miss some minor clumps and if you are not careful can be extremely painful. I'm pretty much convinced that this would be a great product for upkeep but a professional might be the better choice for the initial go due to how much hair men have.Here are some tips I discovered along the way.-Do not apply a section wider than the strip you intend to use. I thought it would save time to apply a huge section and take it off in sections. If anything it only made more of a mess and made it harder to properly apply the cloth.-Use more of a peeling motion, not a ripping motion. The instructions don't clarify this, but I found that a swift peel resulted in cleaner results and less pain than just trying to rip the strip off.-Don't be afraid to reheat. You tend to get lazy when it starts to get thick again, but its way easier to spread when warm.-Do small patches around thick hair, unless of course you like excruciating pain.-The cloth is washable and reusable. The instructions say this at the very end, but it can be easily missed as I just threw out my original batch of cloth."

257473,0,"Muscle Milk Vanilla is slightly less sweet than some protein drinks (including other flavors of Muscle Milk), which I prefer. And the individual containers are a good size. The ones often sold at gyms are larger--too large for a single serving (at least for a small woman) and not big enough for two servings. The biggest problem I have with Muscle Milk in general is that they get clumpy at the bottom. It's important to give these a good shake before drinking, but you still may have some clumps left."
311752,0,"I use lactaid pills everyday, many times a day. For many years I loved Kirkland Signature's (Costco Brand) lactaid pills because they saved me a lot of money. I buy big boxes and then take them out of their wrappers and put them into a pill box that I keep in my purse. Once Kirkland switched from Ultra to Fast Acting, I was no longer able to do this.

Sure enough there it was and now I can no longer take them. If you have a clotting issue or are on any type of blood thinner, even an aspirin a day you need to make sure your Dr. knows that you are taking extra vitamin K!!

252647,0,"I have been using this Stacker 3 product for about a week. The best thing about it is that it gives you that extra energy boost to last all day after your morning coffee wears off. Prior to using these I would sleep for 7 hours a night and still feel the need to nap during the day. That has all ended now, and I am also given extra energy for my workouts. It took me a year to lose 30 pounds, but the weight loss finally leveled off. Though I feel and look way better than before, I still want to lose a little more. I'm hoping that Stacker 3 will help me to lose the last 10 or 15 pounds that I want to get rid of in addition to providing me with the energy I need. There are a few things that should be said about this product that any user should know prior to taking it. Take one after every decent sized meal unless you are sensitive to caffeine, in which case I would not take this product after dinner. I use the pill 3 times a day and also drink about 6 cups of coffee everyday, and I have no problem sleeping at night. Also, make sure you eat before taking this! You will feel terible. I can tell you this from experience because the same thing happened when I used to take a GNC multivitamin. Supplements are made to work with your meals and daily workouts and activites, they cannot do the entire job themselves. Diet smart and safe and you'll be fine. If you're looking for a supplement to provide you with energy that lasts all day but won't make you lose sleep at night, Stacker 3 is a good choice. In a few weeks I will write a follow-up review regarding overall performance and weight loss."

336719,0,"To be honest, I have never tried an epilator before but I'm going on vacation a few weeks and I didn't want to shave, and I've never tried waxing, so I figured I'd give epilating a go. From the other reviews, I knew it was going to be a slow, long, painful procedure but I was ready for it. I followed all the instructions, took a hot shower before hand, was all ready to go. The first time I turned the epilator on, I turned it right off. The buzzing was a lot louder than I thought it would be. So I turned it on and off and prepared for the excruciating pain that would occur. To be honest, it hurt, but not badly. It was more like pinching, though from the sound I thought it was going to be ripping my skin apart. However, after six hours of going at it relentless, I still hadn't completed one whole leg. I watched countless videos on youtube, read and reread the instructions, and there was still hair there! I went over patches again and again, tried doing repeated motions like in the book, tried circular motions, and it would just NOT pick up the hair. Finally I called it a day and tried my other leg the next day. It hurt and I could see hair being pulled up, but there were always lots of patches that remained or hair that refused to be yanked.Then about a week later, I noticed that the hair started to already grow back. I usually shave every two days because my hair grows back REALLY quickly but I thought the epilator would stop that problem. My thinking is that the epilator somehow didn't grab the hair from the root - and it just ripped it instead, making it no better, though indeed more painful, than shaving. I read and reread the instructions and tried my arms, but that pain bordered on unbearable and I had to stop. I haven't attempted my underarms and I doubt I will.My hairs were not too short and they were not too long, either, so I don't know why it was having such trouble picking up the hairs. None of my friends are experienced with epilators to ask and I watched videos on Youtube and I'm going through the same motions, so perhaps I got a defective product? I'm not sure, but epilating did not work well for me. I'm actually going to take the advice of an article I read on epilating. The article said to wax first, epilate later as a ""touch-up"" so that is what I plan on doing. After my hair starts growing in from waxing, I'll give epilating another go and we'll see how that goes.On a positive side, I really like the light as it made it very easy to see the hairs. I gave the product three stars because I feel that if you are an experienced epilator user, you will probably have far less trouble with the product than I did. If you have any advice, questions, comments, or you know what I'm doing wrong, please let me know and I will update my review ASAP. I just wanted to share my own personal experience with first-time epilator buyers."

360400,0,"The picture of this item is somewhat deceptive about it's size. What's not apparent is that there are 10 or 12 inches of pure (non-rubberized) cloth on either side of the rubberized portion. I guess this thing was designed for someone who sleeps on a twin bed with an incredibly thin mattress (cloth sides are supposed to be tucked under?). It's not exactly what I was shooting for but it works fine on a small bed for a small boys' occassional mishaps. It's rubber instead of plastic, so no crackly noise - which is good. I put a no slip mat underneath it (just in case) and it stays in place. Wouldn't recommend this particular design for anyone who rolls around much during sleep, has larger than a twin bed or an adult sized bladder."

74342,0,"I admit I am pretty new to the world of cloth diapering. I just had my second baby, and ran out of all the disposable diapers we got for gifts, so figured the time was perfect to give cloth a try. So far, I have to say I have not loved these. I purchased these, and a set of the kushies. My daughter is 4 months old, and average height and weight (around 12 pounds now). I find these leak alot...like, almost every time she wears them. She has the chunkiest little (ADORABLE) legs, but they still seem to gap around her legs where the kushies do not. They also do not seem to have as waterproof of an outer liner as the kushies. Because most cloth diapers fit a wide range of baby weights, the fit can be a bit tricky, and I am very cognizant of that when changing her diaper. I don't know - I just seem to struggle with these. The positive aspect of them is that the inside fabric is sooooo soft...unbelievably soft. And they dry rather quickly too. I'm wondering if I need to purchase some sort of diaper wrap to wear over them. I have heard good things about the Bummis whisper wrap....My other issue was that shipping took forever from Beach Depot. Also, I was never given the opportunity to choose my colors either, so now my daughter has dark blue and green diapers in addition to her pink ones. Not a huge deal for me, but if color is very important to you, this is a consideration.I hope as my baby girl gets bigger they will fit better and alleviate the leaking issue. Unitl then, I will keep on trying!"

I don't use harsh laundry soap but ecofriendly mixed with borax. I decided to place it underneath my sheet as my sheets are more comfortable than the pad, plus it helps hide the plastic smell. I got this for bed protection from my toddler whom I bedshare with and I like the 52"" so it covers more area if my boy rolls around. Another complaint I have is that it retains heat. We have a temperpedic bed that retains heat as is, so this is just overkill. My child sweats a whole lot at night since we've been using it. It would be perfectly fine during winter, but summertime, not so much. I'd love to find a breathable pad but have had no luck yet. This pad is okay and will do for now but I don't know how much longer I can deal with the extra heat. I will say that it isn't noisy and it doesn't move much, but like I said, I placed it underneath the sheet."

Good thing, it's not too thin that it'll tear, it's just too rough for me. I'm sure there are far better brands out there but these are fairly cheap and pretty decent.

Truthfully, i was expecting it to have the same gritty, unbearable coarse texture and bland taste as a protein mix stirred in water. In order to alleviate this, I mistakenly opted to mix this with flavored water. It was dreadful. It was so sweet; almost to the extent of drinking liquid Sweet 'n Low straight. I learned my lesson and proceeded to mix it with plain water from that point on. The taste was better but still terribly sweet. I managed to drink a full serving a few times but mostly could consume no more than a half serving at a time.I did not notice any real benefit of extra energy, regardless of the quantity consumed. Further, my work-outs were no different - I did not feel the added benefit of lifting more weights or pushing through additional reps. I really wanted to like this as I do enjoy working out a lot but I will be sticking to protein shakes/bars for now."

7960,0,"In my opinion, the handles and grips on OXO kitchen accessories are some of the best on the market. From a design perspective, the soap-dispensing sponge brush is attractive and feels great in my hand. However, the main function of the device is to supply the attached sponge with soap. I have gone through three sponge heads and enlarged the diameter of the soap dispenser hole and I still can't get the sponge to absorb enough soap to wash my dishes effectively. Most of the time I resort to manually squirting a bit of soap on the sponge from a bottle of dishwashing liquid to get the right amount of soap saturated into the brush.I hope OXO can address this issue, as I love how the handle feels in my hand and how easy it is to replace the sponge. If not for the dispensing problem, I would gladly give the brush 5 stars."

363931,0,"The wife and are of smaller build and even with the ""slim"" design, we find it uncomfortable to use. The vibration is mainly at the base of the shaft so total insertion is pretty much required to enjoy. We simply don't care for it. Something a little smaller would be perfect. It seems most of these products assume bigger is better, we often find a slim vibrator is best. We'll keep looking."

45174,1,"Although we have only admitted using the Flowbee to family, it is great! It has paid itself off in about three months, although today I dropped the trimmer foot that clips into the spacers and it broke into several pieces, so I'll have to buy another. This is why I gave it the four star rating instead of a five.Now we don't have to wait until we're shaggy- looking to get our hair cut. It's awesome to never have that ""peeled"" look from just having gone to the stylist / barber - your hair always just looks good... It is also great that the Flowbee haircut requires no cleanup -just put the vacuum away! No scratchy feeling from trimmed hair down your shirt either....We have our Flowbee hooked up to an old Electrolux vacuum (very quiet), and it works well. This way we only have to contend with the noise from the Flowbee itself . This is important because our son is autistic and he will allow us to cut his hair with the Flowbee, so long as he is busy watching a video. Before the Flowbee, going to the barber with him was a nightmare. With the Flowbee there are no sharp scissors to worry about too! :)The Flowbee is well worth the price!"

319658,0,"Well, they pack a lot of protein in a pretty compact size, and they taste pretty good, especially the chocolate chunk.But they're also loaded with malitol, a sugar alcohol, and the amount varies by flavor.Every flavor has 300-310 calories, not bad for 32 grams of protein. All have 9 grams of fat. Mud pie has 18 grams sugar alcohol, chocolate chunk: 28, chocolate fudge: 25, peanut butter: 27.I've had the mud pie fusion and the chocolate chocolate chunk.The mud pie fusions were dry, chalky, and almost tasteless (but I think I got a bad batch, as amazon is very good at storing protein bars wrong), but they tasted good enough for me. They have 18 grams of sugar alcohol per bar, which people will say is a lot, but it never bothered me.The chocolate chocolate chunk tastes much better, but it's a 3 ounce bar with 28 grams (1 ounce) of sugar alcohol. Before I had the chocolate chunk bars, I never thought twice about sugar alcohol, as many of you probably haven't either. I've read about people complaining about it causing GI issues or upset stomachs, but I've never encountered a serving of sugar alcohol that's given me a problem, so again I thought nothing of it. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way (while sitting in a physics class) that an ounce of sugar alcohol is just WAY too much, even for me. Now, I'm usually not one to complain, but seriously, that's a third of the bar. That's the highest I've seen in any protein bar (by a lot). Actually, the only ones I know of that come close are the other flavors of this kind. If you've never had a bad experience from sugar alcohol, this one may be the one to push your limit too. So tread carefully.So if you can tolerate the high sugar alcohols, I'd recommend these bars, but I think Met-Rx could make a protein bar just as well without all the sugar alcohol. If you're not sure if you can handle the sugar alcohol but still want protein plus bars, I'd try the mud pie first, since they have, by far, the least amount in them."

295152,0,"I got this on sale last week with a rebate. Otherwise, I might have felt as if I overpaid for it. So far it is working just fine (getting the job done) and I like the convenience of being able to have it lay flat on the bathroom counter without it taking up much space. I figured we need the Sonicare and this because DS is getting braces next week. I am giving it three stars because it does not seem very study and like so many other flimsy plastic products, planned obsolescence is the name of the game. It did come with a one-year warranty:)"
23393,0,i bought this stethoscope while in nursing school as my first stethoscope purchase because i liked the appearance and other reviews i read. heart sounds can be heard well on this product but lung sounds are not as easily distinguished. they are very muffled and i find it difficult to hear. i would rather have bought a littman from the start.
178619,0,"I give it 3 stars, not because the product itself is bad, but because of the level of service I received from the The Vitamin Shoppe. First of all, The Vitamin Shoppe did a poor job at packaging my order, and as we all know, the guys at UPS play soccer or something with the boxes... at any rate, the container was obliterated when I received it and the contents were sparsed all over the inside of the box. I called the service department at The Vitamin Shoppe and did not get anywhere with the teenager that took my report. So I had to drive twenty miles to a nearby town to get my item exchanged at a The Vitamin Shoppe store (something I should have done in the first place). This actually burned half of my day. I contacted one of the supervisors at The Vitamin Shoppe service department and he assured me I would receive a discount on my next purchase to make up for the inconvenience, which I have since then placed and never received the so called discount. I hope this review will help you in deciding whether you want to do business with The Vitamin Shoppe or their competition."
303275,0,"Yes, this product has a definite smell to it. I'd describe it as distinct and unusual, but not horribly unpleasant. After 10 minutes or so I didn't notice it at all. Initially I thought I was going to turn around and return it to Whole Foods, as it was so oily it was kind of gross. Then I read the package (helps sometimes!)and realized I had not shaken it... this stuff MUST be shaken vigorously or you will get a pump of pure oil. When shaken well, you get a thick serum that does take a good 10 minutes to fully be absorbed into the skin. In the morning, I put it on right out of the shower, and by the time I dried my hair and was dressed I could complete the rest of my makeup. With my oil-free sunscreen and Aveda powder makeup, my face didn't develop shine for about 4 hours (pretty good for me). I've been using the serum for about 5 days now and I do see improvement with it. My facial skin is smooth fresh-looking and it helps with the crepey appearance of neck skin. I will probably try another brand when this runs out, but there are some definite benefits with this product although it's not easy to love!"
78541,0,"The best remedy for a noisy neighbor is just go up to them and have a casual face to face about it. Find something to break the ice with-- baked goods or in my case helping an elderly neighbor with her trash can. If you're like me and live in a condo with thin walls then you have dealt with it-- the mostly quiet neighbor who just happens to leave their tv on through the night. In my case, it only started recently after almost five years living next to this person. She's a nice lady and since our casual chat about it has kept her tv turned down to a moderate level.With that said, let me quickly review the Marpac SleepMate 980A. It works great for mid to high frequencies but not so much for lower frequencies. The worst culprits aside from rap music for low frequencies happen to be loud commercials featuring baritone male spokespersons that dominate late night television. For me, the SleepMate works best when it emits a higher frequency (it's mechanically tunable) similar to common white noise. It's just not loud enough to cover up bass frequencies that carry very well through dry wall. Also the SleepMate emits it's own 'hum' or 'whine' due to the mechanical nature of the product. This irritable sound seems to diminish over time (a couple of weeks) possibly due to break-in.You do become addicted to the white noise though and once you leave it on a for a few weeks it's hard to go asleep without it-- even when it's dead quiet."
387114,0,I got the product to help me sleep. I am not sure it does. Sometimes I sleep welland sometimes I don't and I use it every night. I won't purachase it again with doing without and seeing if I see any changes. The price was good and the amount of product was great.

285163,0,"Most pictures I've seen of this product show one swivel and one non-swivel wheel, but that's just for comparison purposes. There are two swivel wheels, and they work well enough. Unfortunately, they may cause the minimum height setting to be higher than before. My mother had previously used the walker's lowest setting, but these swivel wheels are 3 inches higher than that setting, so she's forced to use it 3"" higher. This may not affect you if you already used higher height settings than 1, 2, or 3. The back legs had to be raised to setting 4 to match the height of the front swivel wheels on setting 1, so the whole walker is now 3"" higher. The picture also shows 5 adjustment holes, but it really has 8, so what they show isn't quite what they send, apparently. But they are good wheels, if you can live with the walker a bit higher than you may normally like.I gave 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 since I was disappointed with the product description - not the product - and the fact I was blind-sided by the extra height requirement. Hopefully, this review will help future customers avoid that feeling and order with foreknowledge of what they'll get."

407747,0,"This is the older NightGuard (which must be why it's so cheap). I've found that the newer NightGuard (with less material around the front and more material towards the back) is more comfortable and lasts much longer. However, if this is your first NightGuard purchase, I'd suggest getting this kind because it's so much cheaper! Then you can see if it works for you, how you like it, what the fitting process is like, etc. before investing in the more expensive, more comfortable one. Frankly, the only reason it makes a difference to me is because I've been wearing a NightGuard for years so I can tell a difference in the subtleties. So in short, I'd take a newer NightGuard over this one, but this NightGuard over any other brand."

Upon receiving the bags, I was disappointed to discover there were only 20, and no large bags.

I'd go through these spells where I felt very heady, like I was going to pass out. I was only taking 250mg per day. I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS, but I couldn't continue with it. This doesn't seem like a common result, but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex's side effects.

I WENT EVERYWHERE looking for it. I found it online and was so happy but his occasional snoring is now nightly snoring and this just didnt work this time around. I was so disappointed. I still gave it 3 stars because I believe it does work for occasional snoring...and he used the dissolving strips too and those worked.

34500,2,"first of all, this product does not look like it does in the picture as it does in person. (it is lacking the the white wand with the on and off switch). It is very difficult to set up onto a shower head and once it is set up, the stream is so small and strong it's like a power washer! thus hurting more than pleasuring.Also, it has an option to switch from your regular shower head to the love jet so you don't have to take it off and put it back on every time you use it, which sounds like a good idea, but who wants that unsightly thing hanging from your shower head every day... what if your mother comes to visit!?This product is a good idea, that just wasn't well thought out, and definitely not worth the trouble."

110729,0,"These little 4 quart galvanized pails are okay. They are made in Mexico and the quality is fair. The main quality problem is the finish of the zinc dip. There were several runs and other minor issues.We use them for outdoor planters for potted plants so these will work fine.The biggest problem was the two or three large labels stuck to the outside of the buckets. The labels said ""Use for intended purpose only."" I guess they mean don't wear them on your head as a hat. Don't sit on them and don't cook in them. But the labels were in multiple languages. Okay!Have you ever tried to remove a label off galvanized metal? After pealing, scraping and using Xylene for an hour or two, most of the sticky residue came off. I don't know about you, but I really don't have a couple of hours to remove gummy residue from a $10 bucket. (update: Now I heat the labels with my heat gun, peal them right off and then remove the residue with mineral spirits. Much faster, but I still shouldn't have to do this.)None of this is Amazon's fault. But all companies buying products should insist that any labels be easy to remove. What a pain. The imported items are the worst. China, Mexico, India and other countries apparently only have one type of permanent super sticky glue for labels.Amazon shipped the 5 4qt buckets and 3 2qt buckets that I ordered in two separate shipments. The first one came in a giant box with each of four buckets spaced equi-distance apart. The second shipment came in a small box with the four buckets stacked one inside of the other. Maybe the first batch was shipped by a new employee.These are okay buckets of fair quality and should work as planters after spending considerable labor to remove the sticky goo from the sides.I'm not sure why they didn't put the labels on the bottom of the buckets. That's what they did on the 2qt ones. I guess 4qt pails have all that appealing open space around the middle."

179692,0,"Pros of this razor:-glides across skin easily and without cutting, so long as skin is wet beforehand. I usually cut myself with any and all razors at some point, but not with this one.-the soap surrounding the razor didn't cause me any irritation at all, a miracle because no matter what shave gel I use on any part of my body I usually end up with stinging, burning red skin to various degrees. Happily, this caused me no problems.-came with a handle holder for the shower, attaches to walls with suction cup. Light weight enough it didn't seem to fall once I made sure both the suction cup and wall I was attaching it to were free of soap scum and any dirty surface. Must adhere to completely clean and smooth surface or it will fall. Use a little alcohol to wipe any small amount of oil or soap away and it sticks fine.-very convenient and fast, though probably better left for touch ups due to it's extremely short life and seeming ability to miss small amounts of hair.Cons of this Razor:-I found I missed quite a few small areas and had to go back over them to make sure my legs were completely hairless. I don't know if this is my error or the razor's error however. It was hard to tell what area of my legs I had not shaved since there is no foam patches like with regular shaving gel to let me know where I have not yet shaved. I also noticed it seems the finer the hair, the less efficient this razor is.-The soap around the razor runs out WAY TOO FAST. I was a bit shocked at how quickly it runs out. You literally will probably get two leg shaving sessions out of this and not much more. I used nearly 3/4 of the damn thing just doing my legs and armpits.-Because of how quickly it is used up it's far too disposable and wasteful for my taste. All these used razors and plastic pieces end up in a landfill somewhere and I know there are no environmentally friendly disposable razors, but these are even more wasteful than usual.-Also, on the note of wasteful, the replacement cartridges cost quite a bit and given how fast they run out, it's really a lot of money in the end. A 6 pack of razor head replacements costs around $14, give or take, and it just seems too much to maintain this razor.Final Conclusion:I would not purchase this again, though it works quickly and relatively efficiently(though I did have missed spots as stated). It is too quickly used up and though I all in all liked it, it's price would prevent me from ever buying it again as well as the guilt of producing needless trash. I'll be sticking to a much longer lasting razor and some normal shave gel, thank you."

If you're expecting something along the lines of one of those tasty cherry ""cough drops"", look elsewhere, because this is not it. Furthermore, they do not seem to dissolve completely no matter how long I leave them in my mouth. I take these in the morning and am willing to leave them in until they dissolve; without fail, there remains a chalky...shell that I have to chew up and swallow.As for energy, I was hoping to see some improvement with the addition of these ""dots"". I often forget to take my vitamins, but popping a dis-solvable pill right after brushing? I can do that! Only, I don't see that much of an improvement. I think I saw more with Goji juice.

5806,0,The item is well made and the blade is sharp and cuts well. The orange surface the pill rests on is a type of sticky material. The pills do not slide on this sticky surface and consequently the pills often do not align properly for cutting. The sticky surface also makes it difficult to get the cut pieces into the reservoir. A smoother surface that permits the pills to slide would be preferable.

157647,0,"This product has done much to alleviate problems in menopausal and perimenopausal women over the years. However, it did me quite a bit of damage. I first started taking it for uterine fibroids, and it did help with that problem. However, this product is fat soluble, and builds up in the body over time. In my case, I am extremely sensitive to cortisol, which is a steroid manufactured by the presence of progesterone. The build-up of this steroid in my blood caused gastroparesis (paralysis of the large muscle in the stomach), insulin resistance, hypothyroidism, and vitiligo, which is a whitening of the skin in patches. A saliva test confirmed the build-up of progesterone in my system, and I stopped using the cream. As a result, everything is back to normal except my thyroid which will probably always require supplementation. To avoid a repeat of my cautionary tale, make sure you test yourself at three month intervals with a saliva test for hormone levels that you can do at home, mail off to a lab, and have the results sent back to you, without the need for an expensive office visit. Careful monitoring will give you the maximum benefit without the possible horrific side effects."

149271,1,"I'm 23 years old and started noticing my hair getting thinner and weaker. I switched my regular shampoo and tried a few different ""natural"" shampoos - Burts Bees, Organics Olive Oil, and a few others but this JASON brand has been the best thus far. Smell is a subtle minty ""barbershop"" smell - masculine and clean. It leaves my hair feeling soft, and my hair has been very strong since using this. At first my scalp would tingle slightly - I do not feel that anymore, but did not mind when I did - I actually liked the sensation because it felt like the shampoo was working hard. Try using this shampoo with the condition by JASON - also very high quality. Only downside is the price - its more expensive than other ""natural"" brands but I think its worth it considering the downside of sulfates and various chemicals."

302350,2,"My husband purchased the Vac'N'Mop as a tool to minimize the amount of time that I spend cleaning kitchen and bathroom floors. At first the product seemed to be the answer to my cleaning needs. I charged the product as indicated for 24 hours before the first use and used the product without complaint. The product sat for a few days before the next use and when I attempted to use the vacuum, the battery died shortly after turning it on. I re-charged the battery and attempted to use the product again, only to find that within minutes the battery was dead again. I called customer service and was informed that the battery life is 9-13 minutes. Well I don't know about you, but 9-13 minutes is not enough time for me to vacuum the kitchen floors much less mop them. I will be returning the product and going back to the tried and true method of sweeping and them mopping until I find a product that will meet my requirements."
293118,0,No wonder they don't show you the whole item in the picture. I am keeping it because it will be handy when traveling. That's because it is simply a piece of sheet plastic with two grommets and nylon ribbon. Much harder to use than a hard plastic preformed unit. You basically roll it into a cone shape and while holding it together pry the sock onto the end. You then insert foot and pull up onto your foot. Because it's a thin sheet of plastic you have to hold it into the cone shape to make it work. Like I said it will be good to throw into a suitcase and get by for a few days but would not be my first choice. I also feel it's overpriced for what you get.

Read reviews and decided to try The Art of Shaving for sensitive skin.I have been using this for a couple months now, through a couple blade cycles and I get the same results with this as with ToBS. Have also tried Vulfix cream with comparable results. Might try classicshaving brand to see if it is any better. My next step is to upgrade to the world of DE razors so I may revisit TAoS cream when I try that.Bottom line is that I get the same or better performance from ToBS for several dollars cheaper per container."

Actually, the product I received appears much easier to assemble than the one the instructions were referring to, but I had to use my own limited engineering skills to figure out how to put it together from the parts in the box. Amazingly, the table works well even with guessing at how to put it together. I'm using it as a laptop computer table while standing up (to reduce the amount of time I'm sitting down while working which is detrimental to my health) and it seems to be up to that. The adjustable height is so far easy to use and readily accommodates my 5'7"" height. Casters also seem to work fairly well at least on hardwood floors. It is adequate for most standard laptops, but probably would not be the best choice a 17"" one."

It sort of reminds me of rotting meat, which actually probably makes sense since the main ingredient in this is Pancreatin, which comes from pig pancreas. When this runs out I do plan on continuing to take enzymes but hope to find some that masks the smell a little better."

I've had a few of these of the years and this is by far the flimsiest. Not only does the handle come off but the stupid brush doesn't want to stay on.

I got this item and used it and it instantly elliminated completely my snoring.The negative side effect was that, since the device stimulates excessive bloodflow to the sinuses it made them feel over pressurised and it also made my head dizzy when I woke up at night.I believe that having such a high blood pressure in the head is not healthy and I have not been able to find any clinical studies dealing with this problem with this device so I dont know how safe it is in this aspect.Since it works i will use it for now but with causion.It never fell off at night."
86910,0,"This heating pad apparently was not tried on before they mass marketed it - It is very cumbersome. Also, does not get hot, it gets warm but not hot. What is cool is you can unplug the cord from the pad and still wear the pad. What is not cool is the heat control switch is placed a few inches down from where it connects to the pad and it's weight pulls the pad to a skewed position. I recommend NOT buying this pad if you are looking for functional convenience. (Like wearing it at your computer at work.)"

254469,1,"These types of products are great marketing schemes. My hair hasn't retreated any further, but is that due to this product? Probably not. My review is based on the actual product not its claims.I use this conditioner combined with their Biotin B complex Shampoo. I can confirm that my hair feels matty after use, thicker might be an illusion. I like the way that my hair feels after 1-2 days of use. It combs well and I literally spend 1-2 minutes messing with it to get a good look.I highly recommend cycling between the two above and something like Coconut milk Shampoo/conditioner to maintain a balance between Thick/Matted and soft/flexible. I would NOT use this shampoo daily for more than 3 days consecutively, but then again everyones hair is different. If that wasnt the case we wouldnt need thickening shampoo :)"

I've never had any of these tablets, but have read about people stocking up.I can't rate them with accuracy because I don,t know if they will work. I will just simply say I like them for their intended purpose.

270847,0,"I bought the 90-pack orange flavor last week and started taking them immediately (gotta love Amazon Prime 2-day shipping!) This supplement tastes GREAT and not fishy at all! It does have a very slight aftertaste (I usually chase it with a beverage anyway.)Well, today (March 11, 2011) I ran across something Dr. Oz published about Omega 3 fatty acids. He says you should aim for 600 mg of DHA daily. This supplement only has 230 mg of DHA and 350 of EPA. Now, depending on your needs, that may be enough of both fatty acids. But, considering I rarely eat fish of any kind (I also have a Lap Band, so I can only do liquid supplements), I need a supplement with as close to 600 mg as possible per serving. So, after hours of research, today I bought Barlean's Fresh Catch Fish Oil. It has 550 mg of DHA and 850 mg of EPA. I'll get it Tuesday, so I'll be writing a review for that later on...LOL. Meanwhile, I'll finish this box, but I'll have to take 3 packets a day to get to 600 mg.

40356,0,"Gaia Quick Defense3+StarsThis product is comparable to Airborne as they both claim to reduce the severity of the symptoms of colds, flu's coughs and fever. The main differences in both products are the ingredients.Airborne has an herb blend, which includes 7 herbs but it doesn't tell you how much of each. It also has vitamins including Vitamin E and Vitamin A. The problem i have with Airborne is the recommended dose is 3x a day at the onset of symptoms. Taking this product three times a day could be dangerous as it would be 300% of your daily allotment of Both Vitamin A and E, which could be toxic levels in some people. With that said, many people do like their product.I liked Quick Defense better as it only contains two forms of echinacea and a very small amount of elderberries and ginger root. The jury is still out if this is indeed effective to starve off upcoming symptoms, but in Germany which is the only country that regulates herbs, it has been approved to treat colds, upper respiratory infections and UTI's.The only thing that really concerned me about this product is the amount taken daily. Directions say to take two pills 5x a day, that seemed excessive to me, however I took them for 2 days and actually did feel better with my head cold.Keep in mind this product should not be used by people with certain diseases and autoimmune diseases. Check with your doctor before taking this or any type of herbal product.If you are already taking this type of product to ward off illness I would definitely recommend this, however I prefer to sweat out the symptoms."

I will continue to use these and hope that the sweating will end."

I decided to let my mom(about 5&#34;7, skinny) try it on, because she has occasional knee pain in her right knee, and the brace fit her perfectly. So I just gave it to her to use.

It has allows use to visit more people and get to other floors and facilities with ease.It should be clear the person in the chair can not wheel themselves around, as it only small wheels.It is light weight and compact which makes it easy to manoeuvre in tight spots.The two brakes are at the back and can only be operated by the carer, which is fine. However, from our experience, if there is a change in carers, there has been cases where someone has tried to move the chair with the brakes on.

The problem is it is 11 pills, none taste good, some are challenging to get down.

190491,0,"I bought the bed cane for my mother who has Parkinson's. We thought it was awesome until she nearly hung herself on it. She slid off the bed and got her head caught under the hooked side. Luckily I heard her before she suffocated. Also, the rail was very loose and wobbly when we first installed it. We replaced the pins that came with it with thicker bolts to make it more steady. It did serve its purpose, helping my mother get in and out of bed on her own, but it also nearly killed her."
206060,0,"I took .25 of tablet and slept really well with tons of very vivid dreams. The next morning I felt great, but later in the day a bit weird. Hard to explain, maybe a bit anxious and distracted. Decided not to take it the next day and still had very vivid dreams. This dream effect lasted for about a week before wearing off. Seems like the stuff should be out of a person's system before that, but that is my anecdotal experience. Tried another.25 tablet and had pretty much the same experience. I use a Zeo to track sleep, and I noticed something I had never seen before, which is that during one part of the night my sleep was so deep it didn't even register. Had the same anxiety/distraction later that day. The next night I didn't take it and had similar sleep experiences. When I woke and checked my Zeo I saw that there was a part of the night that showed I was awake. Very strange because I had no memory of it. Later that morning it came to me and I remembered being awake and thinking about a variety of things but I might never had remembered that if it weren't for the Zeo reminding me. This is a very strange thing to happen and kind of reminds me of some of those stories you hear about people on Ambien doing nutty things at night and not remembering them.So, am I just hypersensitive? Is this a typical reaction? Who knows. Not a lot of info for this supplement. I'm personally worried about trying a higher dose, but that worry might be unfounded. There is some discussion on some of the forums about some neurotoxic effects of this supplement, but that is also speculation at this point. Anyway, I'm giving 3 stars as it is clearly effective, but are the effects good/healthy or not? I don't know. So for the time being, I'll be putting this supplement aside."
392183,0,"I bought this for my wife, and it is way too big for her. Being a normal sized guy down there, maybe a bit above average in length, I thought she'd enjoy something a little girthier. But she hated it. We tried on 3 occasions (she's a real trooper) to make this thing work for her. We used LOTS of foreplay and quarts of lube. It was still very uncomfortable for her.It has a very nice feel to it, looks extremely realistic, and has a good flex/firmness combination. So I'm giving it some credit for the overall construction. It was shipped to us quickly, and showed up in a very discreet box.I don't understand the reviews by these women who love this thing. They must be used to coke can wide men. Some loose ladies out there I suppose. Wish they had something of this quality and price that was engineered for a human rather than a female elephant!!!"
140441,0,The product works excellently by itself without being connected to your computer. I had a lot of trouble configuring the connection at first--even their tech support wasn't helpful but for some strange reason it just started interfacing all by itself. I would have given it a 5-star if it hadn't been for the initial computer-configuration problem. Perhaps they've improved it since I bought my several years ago.

349471,0,"I have practiced biofeedback (brainwave, heart rate, temperature, galvanic response, etc.) with success using various visual or auditory feedback mechanisms. Usually, but not always, the more expensive the instrument the more effective. When I found this relatively inexpensive stress thermometer, I thought it worthwhile to give it a try. I found temperature change to be quite slow and unreliable with temperatures fluctuating too much to offer effective visual feedback. I suspect the inexpensive thermistor (probe) and ineffective and inconsistent contact of the probe with the skin may be the culprit. I haven't found a way to overcome this problem. Yet. As others have noted, the display is hard to secure. In any case, it was worth a try. And I still have a thermometer I can use to monitor various things around the house and shop."
25122,0,"After my back surgery I am not able to twist and do the wiping the old fashioned way. I learned about this tool in the rehabilitation facility, so to get it right away I had someone purchase it at local Medical Supply store for 2 times as much as Amazon. I wish knew about this tool earlier so I could have bought prior to surgery.No, it does not work as well as doing it with a hand, but it sure beats asking someone else to do it for you.You will have to experiment with various techniques to find what works best for you, prepare to use a lot more toilet paper, many many swipes, and sometimes get your hands dirty. But it does the job.Updated a week later:I decided to buy a second toilet aid so I would have one in each bathroom. I purchasedIdeaworks Long Reach Comfort Wipeand it works much better! It grips the paper better then Self-Wipe, the rubbery head (rather than smooth plastic of Self-Wipe) gives you a better wipe, it uses less toilet paper, you never get your hands dirty because of how the ejection button works.Long Reach is a simpler, cheaper alternative, that is engineered better! Based on the comparison with the other product I am reducing the stars for Self_Wipe from 4 to 3."

Its longevity may be questionable, but it's a much better choice than the Dollar Tree product.

132829,1,I find the unit to be excellent in operation. I find that the water resevoir is a little small.

352181,0,"I always use ""neck pillows"" and have to renew after some time because the middle gives out and gets flat. It seems the covers for the pillows are almost as expensive as the pillows, so when, after much research I found this pillow *WITH* cotton cover (""Removable white polyester/cotton cover is machine washable"") at a good price, I bought 4 to stock up. To my disappointment the "" removable cotton cover"" was actually just the outer layer of fabric that keeps the stuffing in, not a removable pillow case as I had thought I was going to get. After the first night using it I thought the pillow was already squishing down. It seems to have plateaued after several uses, and not getting too thin too fast. The cotton outer fabric is a step up from other pillows that have a papery outer fabric, so this is a plus, just not what I'd expected. For the price, I would purchase again, but don't expect to get a removable, washable pillow case."

109293,1,"A friend of mine gave me a few packets of this- 2 chocolate and one orignal vanilla. the consistency is very thick, so I recommend using only half a packet- as it will fill you up. I tried the chocolate at first- mixed it with chocolate soy and it was tasty but as I stated very thick because I used the whole packet. My friend told me that the vanilla tasted like cake batter- I'm not a true vanilla fan, but this is soooooooooooooooo good... I mix 1/2 a packet with some vanilla soy and it tasted like pancake batter- but not too sweet. I supplement this as a snack or meal (lunch). I'm trying to lose 10lbs and using this product with eating fresh fruits and salads will surely get me there. I'm full, satisfied with no shaky or hungry feeling. Yummy, yum, yum... You'll love it!!!Use 1/2 of a packet with 8 oz of soy or skim milk. A Full packet is very thick. I used a shaker bottle for about a minute and it was the perfect consistency."

169592,0,"The Muscle Juice has a lot of calories per serving (read the directions).I was warned by the other reviews on the banana syrup sweetness. But I didn't think it was too bad. But it is.Definitely it is better to mix it with fruits, or use to sweeten drinks/beverages. Another important point is the high content of calories. I just had once the full recommended serving indicated by the product, but I felt that it was too much (I got a headache), so I stopped using that dose and used lower servings. In any case, make sure that you do your workout to use all the calorie content because you don't want to accumulate all that in your body. I have been used it for a couple of months with intervals, so I cannot tell if I am getting the results expected by me (muscle growth). It's cheap but too sweet for some tastes, so read the full product descriptions for a more accurate opinion."

340858,0,"Since there are lots of other reviews, I would like to limit my comments to a few remarks that are not always addressed by others.The cane is strong enough to support weight. The hand grip is some kind of foam, not very comfortable. It gives a good grip but will probably become grubby. I prefer a grip that fits the hand better and that is easier to wash.The second point is that the rubber tip is fine on a super clean floor but if there is anything on the floor, it will slip. I spilled some herb powder and nearly took a dive.All-in-all, if I had it to do over again, I would buy a completely different cane.Update: I did buy another cane, same company but foldable and with a wooden handle (and less expensive). I like it better except for one detail. The foam handle and curve in the cane make it easier to hang from a counter. However, unless this is important, I would definitely say the foldable cane is more comfortable and more aesthetic. Moreover, it does not seem weaker."

No. I took it apart cleaned of the the shipping grease, checked the gasket(I had to apply some bag bomb to it so it seal better)and it seems to work all right for me, its messy to use since the water needs to come back out of your ear, but to me its just a side effect of doing the job."

I may even pick up the software to track my progress, which is only $25 from the company's web site. It's comforting to make an objective measurement of something that seems so subjective.

Unfortunately I don't have much experience with protein supplements.The first time I ordered EAS vanilla, it could not be better. It mixed well and was very drinkable, even with water when I used a martini shaker. For whatever reason, the second batch I ordered does not mix well at all, especially with milk (I had not done anything different in mixing it). It just clumps up and I need to use a fork to break it up for about five minutes. Adding milk is a disaster and with water it tastes horrible unless I get the clumps to dissolve. I'm debating whether to order this again or try something else. None of these reviews mention this problem, so it was probably a fluke - I'm curious if others have had this problem."

When I informed them of the second error, I too was offered the 20% discount, which would only put my price at the currently offered $39.99, really no discount or attempt to rectify problem.

Also, I purchased a Lady Comp and the temperature reading on the BD Basal varies to that of the Lady Comp which is a bit disturbing since i bought this thermometer to help verify the Lady Comp but I am going to have to go with the overpriced Lady Comp and say that its correct and the BD Basel is off but who really knows. Did a comparison between our regular digital themometer and the BD and the BD was .4 degrees lower than the regular thermometer but the Basal temp is higher than the Lady Comp reading. Like i said who knows which is the correct temp. I am guessing that as long as each is in the 97 degree range when your not ovulating and in the 98 range or significantly higher than 97 when you are ovulating it doesnt matter much if the thermometer is right on the money; but like i said, thats just a guess..."
349852,0,"I can see how this is very convenient when you first start brushing your baby's teeth because there is a lot more control over movement when you're cleaning with your finger instead of a brush. It would have worked best for us around 4-5 months when our baby popped her first teeth but wasn't biting very much. At that point, it would've been a lot better than manually wiping her two teeth with a washcloth.However we bought this when our baby had around eight teeth and at that stage, this didn't really work for us. For one, if our baby clamped down, this would come off in her mouth and sometimes fall to the bathroom floor, requiring extra sanitization. For another, our baby would bite down hard on this because of the rubbery texture. This got very painful very fast - it got to the point where my husband and I were flipping coins to see which one of us would brush baby's teeth on any given night.I recognize that these issues have nothing really do with the quality of the product per se but I just want to let other parents with overly bite-happy babies like ours know what to expect. We're now using actual baby toothbrushes as our baby got used to them faster than we expected and in fact now tries to hold them to brush her teeth on her own."

301766,0,This trimmer can be used by both men and women. Only downside is we need to replace the battery once fully discharged but it consumes very less power. Trimming action is good for the price we pay.

231169,0,"There is a bracket at each end on top of the broom, so that you can clamp the head on the handle. These horns are made of hard plastic, same as the head of the broom. Nice idea, but it means the broom will not sweep under stuff that you would think it would, from seeing the photo on Amazon. I wanted to sweep under a railing, and I kept banging the horns. I can cut them off, but it won't be pretty. I just used it once so far, but it is very stiff. Probably better for big stuff. To be very, I used it on a textured surface. It might be better on a smooth surface like smooth concrete."

225529,0,"First, let me state that I have arbitrarily rated this item with 3 stars because I was forced to make a star rating in order to complete the review. My personal opinion is somewhat mixed possibly because of an unavoidable bias. I purchased this item to replace one I had lost after about 25 years. The two differ somewhat. The Rubis does seem to be made of thicker and possibly higher quality steel, but it seems to be stubbier and shorter. My use has been limited to date, but it doesn't seem to be quite as easy to use as my former one. However, it is serviceable. The one thing I really miss is the old soft plastic case, which was essentially just large enough to hold the scissors and let it easily slide into my ""dop bag"" or a crevice anywhere in my suitcase. The large hard plastic container is excessive and inconvenient."

259132,0,"If this lasted me a year at this price I would be thrilled. I use a high quality reach brush with a rubber tongue cleaner on the back of the head. Went to the manufacturers website but could not see a list of approved brushes. At any rate this works great on my brush. I understand the burning, heating issues many people complain about. This device does not turn off but goes into a drying mode. Still kind of hot in drying mode but it takes hours for the inside of the case to dry. I put this on a Belkin energy switch and can make the device turn off in 1/2 hr, 3hrs, or 6hrs. Having it on the six hour switch off mode is perfect. My brush is a little discolored (offwhite) but does not seem burnt and does seem very clean. I haven't had to clean the reservoir that holds the water and stick to distilled. Can even put one of my taller but narrow combs in it for cleaning.I can tell the manufacturer is flaky from their website and some of the more bizarre reviews and controversy surrounding whether these are authentic or not. With my current setup it works for me and I like it.A three hour setting works best. Also I've noticed after its been going a good 15-20 minutes I'll carefully take the top off and shake the dropplets off. Seems to have everything dry better at the three hour level.My hygienist noticed a difference with me using this. Glad I bought two because I think its important to have a clean toothbrush.Awesome product. Could be better but for the price it really like this device. Seems to clean better than some of the UV devices I have. It's like putting your toothbrush thru a hot dishwasher after each use."

172496,0,"This is an excellent protein powder in terms of ingredients: whey, egg, and casein all in one product! I tried it for that very reason, hoping the banana cream flavor would be as tasty as the other Pro Complex flavors. It's not, though... at least not to my taste buds. It's got a very artificial, harsh, banana bubblegum flavor that is really not too pleasant. I tried mixing in some chocolate syrup, but that didn't help much. The fake banana flavors are just too potent to be covered up by the added chocolate. I honestly can't see buying more of this, even though I really love the variety of proteins in this product. I am disappointed that ON chose to include casein in only the banana cream flavor of Pro Complex. If they added casein to the Rocky Road flavor, it would be the perfect protein powder in my opinion."

106708,0,"I should've known ""you get what you pay for"" when I purchased this shaver. I have an older Panasonic that cost closer to 100 bucks. It's lasted quite a long time and maintained solid performance overall. The ES4026 looks and feels like a shaver better suited for a 17 year old with new facial hair to cut on. I have thick, coarse facial hair and this shaver just didn't do the job - I could tell from the first cut that it wasn't for me.Overall, not a bad shaver but I'll keep it in mind for my son to use when he turns 16.....it's definitely not one to use for the seasoned face."
250924,0,"The more I use these ""gimmick"" attachments the more I think the best move is to use the regular heads or maybe the dual action. The stiff flossing points do feel pretty good on your gums but as far as actually mimicking the action of really flossing your teeth, I suspect they are not that effective. Definitily stay away from the heads with the polishing cup. That just doesnt do anything unless you have real dental polishing paste maybe."

The product creates a wonderful lather and I would not hesitate to order again if only Taylor's would offer an unscented product. In the old days possibly the strong aroma covered the smell of ones horse. But alas I drive a Honda. I guess they do not make men like they used to!
92695,0,"I purchased this for my Mother for Christmas. She is elderly and lives by herself. We had tried another similar product a few years ago but with very mixed results.It was easy to set up and easy to operate and the built in system tests give you piece of mind that it is functioning.The BAD, hers was in operation until today when the base unit lost power. We tried everything with no results. I called the companies customer service and got a very nice gentleman that is sending a replacement unit out today. This is somewhat disconcerting but a quick glance at the base unit showed that it had no power and then a quick system check confirmed that.I'll let you know when we get the replacement and how it works."

37464,0,"I bought this for my son who has frequent lows. I purchased the 31-g tubes as an alternative to the 45-g tubes of Glutose 45 and because the price per g was half as much. Unfortunately, he told me (1) the tubes are not as easy to open as Glutose, (2) the tube can not be reclosed if he doesn't use the entire dose, (3) it's much thicker and more difficult to extract from the tube than Glutose. While it gets the job done, and isn't a bad product, when he's low enough to need glucose, he wants something he can actually get open and into him more easily than this product. Last time I checked, Glutose 45 is not available on Amazon."

322680,0,I've been using this for quite some time and overall I am not very impressed. It does give you energy but nearly any b-100 will do that. I do not like that due to all the synthetics in this capsule it turns my bodily functions into a different color. It also makes it smell. I have tried vitamin code organic b100 and found that to be a far better product without turning my waste into a differnt color (but its pricey).

I'm not sure if it's something in the product that I'm sensitive to or if I'm just not rinsing enough. I'd probably recommend it to a friend to try and if his or her eyes felt fine, great. As for myself, I don't think I'll use this again. I'll continue to use regular saline and multi-purpose saline."

374919,0,"the product was good but the ""use before date"" was too close to finish the package. Maybe they should write info of the dates before you buy them."
424660,0,"When I used these strips, I found that they were too flimsy, and therefore tended to bend back over themselves, making them difficult to apply. After they were applied to the teeth, they did not always stay in place and tended to slide around. Also, it is inconvenient to have to remove the strips, when they have done their work. For these reasons, I do not consider them to be the best alternative. A much better alternative is the dissolving whitening strips manufactured and distributed by CVS Pharmacy, Inc. These strips are less flimsy/ more firm and therefore don't stick onto themselves, they adhere to your teeth far better; AND they dissolve completely in about 5-7 minutes, leaving no messy residue or plastic film to have to discard. On size strip (larger than Crest's) fits both upper and lower teeth. The active ingredients are the same as Crest, but the cost is about half the cost of Crest. Superior to Crest in every way."
259496,0,"Had I had a picture of the opposite side of this brace, I would not have ordered it. Yes, they explained that the laces offer good support, but they didn't say that it looks like a roller skate on the side that the world sees. How many people think I'm Edward Lacehands meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre killers I do not know. But, I do know I dislike the way the brace looks immensely and am glad I ordered it for a minor surgery and not daily wear for carpal tunnel. Aside from that, the brace does offer good support and feels strong like a nice denim. But, it is a bit large for me; even though it is for 6.5-7.5, it is somewhat loose for my 6.5 wrist. Despite being a bit large, the brace still irritates the base of my thumb a lot to the point of bruising, but I've dealt with it since even crutches bruise you... so there are some discomforts to healing that maybe cannot be avoided. Then again, I once used a Futuro brace and had no such issues. Perhaps these are the drawbacks of quite a sturdy brace. Bottom line: I would have stuck with a brace from a local store that I could return if uncomfortable or ordered the cheaper braces on Amazon."
210325,2,"My wife and I have been purchasing various items from Amazon for years, and we have never been disappointed until now. The issue is not about the cost of the item, it is about the seller NOT specifying that the item could not be returned. The collar does not fit me. Therefore I cannot use it. I would suggest that all Amazon customers make purchases of items offered by Amazon ONLY!! That is what our family is going to do from now on."

149593,0,"This review is for Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Natural Whey, Chocolate, 5.13-Pound Tub. Once I received the product, I was very disappointed to find Stevia in the ingredients listed on the label. Stevia is an artificial sweetener (extracted from a plant). Given the description of the product, ""All Natural: No artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners."", this surprised me, especially since it is not listed in the ingredients list on the product page.Stevia gives me a stomach ache.Otherwise the taste is so-so, and I find that it must be mixed with a sweetened beverage to be palatable (e.g. vanilla soy milk or a frappuccino). Once mixed with a sweetened beverage the stomach-ache-iness effect is also reduced."

134946,0,"This product worked well and as advertised. I have suggestions as to how it could be improved.I have not found information on how to use the pik beyond sticking the end in your mouth and turning it on. Is it best to run the tip along the gumline? Hold it out a quarter inch? Angle it a specific way?It came with several tips but little information on what they would be used for. And only one standard tip. Surely a high number of households could use a tip per person, at a small price to the makers. Maybe they are counting on added sales of tips for households of more than one.On initial startup the water had so much plastic taste that it bothered me for a while afterwards. Surely with all the new concerns over plastic that is a Bad Thing, maybe worse for health than teeth not being water flossed. Now I empty and rinse the tank, not just add water, and run water through the hose before using. But I am still concerned about how much plastic I am getting."
34330,0,"These lint traps work well enough. They catch the lint, to be sure, but they quickly look grodie and disgusting. And no, they are not very easy to clean, particularly when you're grossed out. The lint sticks in every crevice and you just can't get them clean. And leaving them in the sink is especially gross, since we use our kitchen sink to drain ourLG Washer/Dryer Combo. So in searching for a better alternative, we came up with the idea of using organza pouches instead. TheseOrganza Jewelry Pouches, 100pcwork like a charm, have their own tie-offs sewn right in, catch MORE lint than these real lint traps, and best of all -- they're so cheap, I just use them once or twice and then just toss 'em. Perfect! I got a pack of 100 which made them about 13 cents each. Waaaaaaay more economical than standard lint traps, which push $1 a piece, at the cheapest; often more. Just my 2 cents. Works great for us."
37175,0,"I purchased the Thermoskin Arthritic gloves, size medium, as suggested by my physician. The intended purpose was to help use my fingers/hands with less strain and pain, as I have arthritis/R.A. in joints of hands. The activities which have been bothering me are things like keyboard typing/ using the mouse, some handwriting, working with beads/jewelry making, and some light sewing projects. First reaction was that movement of fingers became much too clumsy while wearing these gloves. The size I ordered is correct (I used measurement chart) but I was surprised by how thick they are (incl. along the fingers). The exterior finish is quite scratchy/prickly, so I found it tends to catch on some fabrics. After a while, my hands felt somewhat sweaty, while fingertips become too cold.Since I also do various other outdoor activities, such as gardening, raking, more recently, some shoveling and driving, it looks like these gloves may help to protect and stabilize my hands/fingers during these activities. However, to keep gloves clean and/or hands warm (if weather is cold/ depending on what I am doing), then I need to find roomy enough workgloves/ mittens to wear over them. Driving with them is about the only activity where I can use them 'as is'. My conclusion is some folks, like myself, might find their use limited, mainly due to their bulkiness. I will still keep them for tasks that use the entire hand, but not for anything requiring more precise finger placement (like typing)."

219013,1,"I'll make this a quick review...PROS=====Compared to Alkalines---------------------They hold a charge almost as well as an Alkaline, with more power! (almost double in my tests)Compared to Ni-mh Rechargables------------------------------More power as well as they hold a charge for months! After about 1 month of no use I was showing around 85% charge left. That's pretty good to me!In general----------You can use your own standard Ni-mh charger and is should work fine, mine did. (works fantastic for the WII remotes...they last over twice as long as Alkalines)CONS====They cost a lot. (No problem for me, they pay for themselves in a few uses)They take a while to recharge...I can't remember how long, Now I just charge them overnight.In conclusion,Your hunt for Rechargables is over, get these and find the best of both worlds!!"

378291,0,I really liked this tub because it would change with my growing child. The first time we used it the water slowly leaked out the bottom.

167419,0,I bought these tights to give me some mild support during pregnancy. The material is sturdy and does not run despite constant pulling and tugging. This is because the stomach and crotch are too loose and require frequent readjustment. I would either order one side smaller or the thera firma brand which is just as sturdy and stays in place.
341825,0,"This product is just okay...sometimes it seems to work, but honestly I only seem to smell it when I shift it around. I don't think it is great at absorbing any odors, but it may help slightly. I use it near my cat's litter box so maybe nothing can tackle these odors. I will say it does not dissipate too quickly, as I have read in some reviews. This particular smell is amazing and it is not too strong for those with sensitive noses. All around, the product has only been okay for me but it may work for someone else. I prefer a lit Yankee Candle."
406770,0,"I bought this mostly for use in breakfast smoothies. The first time using it, I added 3 tablespoons to a mixed berry smoothie (smoothie recipe on the bag calls for 3 TBS), and it was awful. It left a terrible after-taste that lingered for hours. Maybe it's better with bananas and apples, as in the recipe on the bag, than berries. Next time, I added only 1 TBS and it tasted fine and then increased to 2 TBS, which works too. It's a good additive to homemade breads. I've put the remaining 3 bags of the 4-pack in the freezer because it'll take a while to use it all. I like that it's free of artificial additives that so many protein powders have. Acceptable product, good price."
320345,2,I've used Dryell for years and thought I'd give this a try. The brand is known for being gentile and the price was better than Dryell. Big mistake. Dresses that I've successfully Dryelled several times were stained with an oil from the Woolite cleaner. I will never buy this product again.

321868,0,"Well, I promised to write a review if I got pregnant, so here we go - after 10 years of trying to have a baby on and off, and using the watch for about 4 months, we finally got pregnant!! I would love to say that the watch is wonderful but it would not be completely true, while it is great and perfect for those who are not very good in keeping track of days and temperature, it has a few issues.I didn't have the problem with the low battery or dim screen as many experienced - but I had an excessive build-up of salt and the sensor had to be constantly cleaned, otherwise it would not read. There was one month of which the watch failed to read after a few days, and I didn't have an extra sensor handy, it was a waste of a cycle and sensor. The watch was very bulky to wear and I had to adjust it all the time on my wrist - it will take you awhile to find a good position. The sensors are pricy but it is good to have a few extra ones - just in case, one of them malfunctions, and you will certainly not want to wait another month.Although it is not perfect, it does the job, at least it did for me - as my next step would have been fertility clinic appointments. I would just say that you need to take the good with the bad - don't expect a perfect product as you will not get it but it is very helpful if you are trying to conceive.Good luck!"

351954,0,"I bought this recently for my parents. My father takes Coumadin, a blood thinner, and so I thought this would be ideal for him since it doesn't contain vitamin K. However, in the last couple days I became interested in Vitamin D and, to make a long story short, mostly on a whim I looked up whether there are any problems between it and Coumadin. To my surprise what I found is that it can increase the rate of artery calcification, at least according to a study published in 1999 titled ""Warfarin-Induced Artery Calcification Is Accelerated by Growth and Vitamin D"". Another site (home.caregroup.org) recommended that those taking Coumadin supplement with no more than 400 IU of Vitamin D a day without consulting a doctor first.Since this particular multivitamin contains 1000 IU in each tablet I am obviously recommending my dad not to take it. I think it is fine for my mother who isn't on blood thinners, but I thought I would come here and alert others who may be in my dad's situation or thinking about buying it for someone who is.Note: Coumadin is one of the brand names for Warfarin. To research this yourself, I recommend using ""warfarin"" as your search word since it usually turns up more hits."

The heat is wonderful (very therapeutic) and I can just set the temp and time, adjust the pad to the best position and relax.However...the cord, the cord, the cord. The cord has a mind of its own - it just wants to twist into a pretzel shape (its *default* position??) and I can't tell you how many times I've unraveled, untwisted, straightened and pulled at this cord. Every night I get into some kind of wrestling match with this thing. The same thing is happening to the one at work and to a another pad I had.An open plea to any TheraTherm engineers that might look at this. PLEASE FIX THE CORD!!"

60714,0,"Our newborn was having tons of gas pain, so I decided to try this. I like that it's natural and he doesn't have to ingest anything. I think it smells nice, but it is quite potent and my husband wasn't the biggest fan. It's easy to use- just pop it in the microwave for about 20 seconds and it's ready to go, and stays warm for a while. You can velcro it nice and snug around the waist. I very much like the idea of it.However, in reality it didn't seem to help much with his gas, he would have to suffer through his bout of pain as usual. Then again, pretty much nothing really worked to solve his gas issues- we tried every gripe water and colic tab out there. I just had to snuggle him for a little while until it passed. Thankfully, it's much better now!But- fortunately for us our baby did not have many issues with colic or general fussiness... it was just the gas bouts. I think that if he just needed some comfort, the band would work nicely- probably in much the same way a swaddle blanket or just some good snuggling would. It seems like the warmth and security would feel nice for them.Therefore- 3 stars. Not convinced it does anything for gas, but it could be a good calming tool."

410838,0,"Trying to help a friend with roots in the sewer line from their house.I've spent a fair amount of time researching and the chemicals used in this product seems to be the best you can come by, as well as the way it claims to work.We rented a roto rooter machine from Home Depot and used this product within minutes after perfoming the roto job back in January 2010 (while the raw root is exposed this product works perhaps the best, otherwise the root will try and protect itself and form a coating that will inhibit this product from killing the roots. If you wait too long after using the roto rooter you have to wait 6 weeks before applying this chemical, has to do with the tips of the roots and how they asborb nutrients/chemicals etc).We repeated this same procedure again in April 2010. We plan on using just the chemical treatment again the beginning of July 2010 then fall back to once a year treatment with using only this chemical and hope it does the trick to keep the main drain clear (that is what the vendor claims should work once a year treatments we just went into overkill mode to be sure). So far so good no clogs.From reading it appears that after several once a year treatments you can drop back to using once every couple of year. We will have to see? I had the home owner installed several water leakage dectector (bought from [...]), so if their drains get clogged up again they will know right away and perhaps reduce the damage done. Fingers are crossed this product works as claimed."

273552,1,"Overall, I have been pleased with these supplements and would recommend them to other hormonal acne sufferers like myself. I deducted a star because they are a bit expensive, and remembering to take 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening can be a hassle. I have been taking them for 3+ months and have seen a reduction in my cystic acne (something I've been plagued with since I was a teenager). For anyone who suffers from hormonal break-outs, you know that topical ointments are a complete waste of time and money. I've tried every spot treatment, face mask, facial cleanser, exfoliator, toner, etc. for my acne, and none of it has put an end to the stubborn deep, cystic acne that I get once a month. Since this kind of acne is internal, you have to treat it with such, and these vitamins do a good job of that. Before resulting to something like Accutane (which I am not dogging - it worked wonders for me but it's not for everyone), give these a shot. A word of warning: these are pretty big (most vitamins are), and they don't smell or taste pleasant (I take them with a swig of soda to mask the taste, then drink a bunch of water). Also, if you're going to commit to taking these, take them for at least 6 weeks before giving up! I saw my most drastic change around the 6 week mark."

The small rash I had turned into a massive reaction that ended up with my eyes swollen shut and the poison ivy all over my body. This stuff, if you use it when you have the rash, actually spreads the oil out and you end up with a worse rash. If you get poison ivy and the rash has already developed, then just use caution to not spread it and regular soap with a steroid cream. You will completely regret using tecnu if you have the rash. I gave it three stars cause I havent used it like its supposed to be used so I cant speak to how it works as far as preventing the rash."

244657,0,This electric shaver is not perfect or as good as some reviews claim it to be. The braun 6000 series (now obsolete after this product came out) gives a much better shave believe it or not and the foil is shaped better than this one giving an easier shave to the face. Also I didnt like the fact that the braun 7526 has a cradle charger which means it cant be used as a corded shaver if the charge was low. You have to wait for it to recharge again which doesnt take that long but if you are in a rush often to get to work or dont wanna wait around than this can be an annoying problem compared to just plugging one in such as the braun 6000 series razors could be used as cordless or corded and and you can finish up without wasting any more time. As far as the actual shave the 7526 can give you a close shave but I have to go over the same spot several times to get it and this causes more skin irritation. This is not a bad shaver but is not nearly as good as the 6000 series designed brauns. Right now it sits unused for the most part as a backup shaver or emergency shaver in case my braun 6520 fails at some point. I truely believe that Braun made a mistake by making their 6000 series razors obsolete to this one because I and I know many others find the 7526 to be not as good and wouldve liked to see stores still selling the 6000 brauns.

Disappointing."
310279,1,"I was very happy to find this item, and can say that it is much better than trying to soak a new piercing in salt-water (not very convenient for a helix piercing).It does exactly as it says: It cleans the piercing & the jewelry & dissolves crusted lymph fluid.The only problem I have is that you aren't supposed to dry it or wipe it ... and it eventually dries to leave a really dried area. I have found this to be a bit too drying and causes the earring to fuse with the skin - which means tearing skin when spinning the earring. Since a big part of getting piercings to heal is to keep the skin from fusing with earrings, I think this is a negative for this product.I continue to use it multiple times a day whenever I feel itching or irritation, but I have recently purchased another product that is a liquid soap called Crazy Chameleon piercing cleanser from [...] that has helped IMMENSELY with calming the area down & really promoting healing. It is said to also reduce scar formations.I think the H2Ocean is a good product, but its healing abilities are questionable."

I actually like firm pillows, but I would've preferred that it were a tad softer. Nevertheless, it worked well. It was a nice size.I wish it had a small snap button loop on one end (as is found on another travel pillow I have) so that I could attach it to my carry-on bag. Sometimes, the carry-on is just too full to stuff a pillow in and carrying by hand always leaves the chance of you leaving it behind. I found the little scent packet a little gimmicky."

226262,1,"I have been getting my back waxed for a few years (at $40 a whack) and found the Mangroomer on Amazon a few months ago. At the price of one wax, I thought, why not try it? I have been generally satisfied with the results. In the winter (unless I am going somewhere that will require me to remove my shirt) I usually don't bother with waxing as it is expensive and rather painful.I used the Mangroomer after several months of hair neglect. My back hair REALLY grows fast and when I began and looked in the mirror, I thought ""no way"". The unit takes a bit of patience and self training. The blades are sharp and will scratch you pretty well if you bear down, The trick is to glide it lightly over the skin and the blades will do a marvelous job. The first time I used it, I did produce a few scratches but they cleared up in a day. The shave was pretty good for a low priced tool and certainly a LOT easier than the Razorba that I have also used.All in all, I would recommend this item for guys who are relatively patient and dexterous. If you are expecting perfection, then go spend $40 for a wax job. But if you want a perfectly adequate solution, then certainly invest $40 in this tool"

390878,0,"This feather duster (TXF20BK),purported to have been produced by Texas Feathers, was described as being made with premium, black ostrich feathers, and for the price I paid ($17.75), it should have been. Having owned 2 Texas Feathers black ostrich feather dusters previously, I can tell you that this one is NOT. It is made with the less fluffy, less expensive,(& less dust catching) grey feathers (from a female ostrich?). Nowhere on the feather duster was there a logo, sticker, tag or anything to indicate that this duster was actually made by Texas Feathers. Buyer beware!"
373077,0,"I have long been a fan of Band-Aid Bandages since I was a kid, but these particular ones surprised me when it only barely stuck overnight on a scratch that I acquired from my one of my Poms. I'm now a little skeptical of these ones. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCPW8C/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 and I bought quite a few, I'm hoping that this box is the only one that is like this!"
425650,1,This item was exactly as expected. It arrived promptly. I have no negatives for this merchant or item. Will need more in the future. Will consider ordering again.

270140,0,"We're waiting on other minerals to arrive. However, my wife needed some asap, this was the best stuff we could find. It helped her, but it tastes nasty. I mixed it with juice that masks the taste of this kind of thing, but it didn't work with this stuff. I won't say that you can't mask it; I can't say that you'll dislike the taste. It tasted like drinking cough medicine, I'll be happy when the other stuff comes in. You may not care how it tastes but I wanted to share my experience with it."
109996,0,"I purchased this as a calcium-magnesium supplement for my kids. This particular bottle does NOT have calcium as the picture of the nutrition label states.

43922,0,"This is the only device I have to measure my body fat so I am not sure how accurate it is, however I can say that the there is sometimes wide variances in what it reads. One day it kept reading 11% body fat. I know I am definately not in that range at all. Most of the time it reads in the 14's which I think is about right. This is a good tool to track decreases in body fat. If you see the number it gives you steadily going down over a time period then you know you are losing body fat. However the number it tells you may not be what your body fat is."
326710,0,"I think this item would work well if you took it long enough, but I quit only because I kept forgetting to take as directions said. My fault, not the products."

340805,0,"This was a good deal and definitely helps with varicosities. However, the fit is difficult. You are always better off getting the stockings that are custom fitted to your body. The fit of these (bands form in areas, so you have to adjust all throughout the day) is ok, definitely better than not wearing ANY stockings!"
283900,1,"This Dreammate wrist band is a wonderful product in many ways. It has helped me to sleep better, and for that I am very thankful. When it stimulates 3 acupuncture points on your left wrist, it sends some ""message"" to the brain that makes you drowsy. Glad it shuts itself off after 30 minutes because I often fall asleep while it is still on.That said, it is not perfect. This product will not make your mind stop wandering, and it doesn't solve every sleep problem. I think it is worth a try, however, since the concept of stimulating acupuncture points is sound. The real negative is shoddy workmanship -- mine has fallen apart. The glue has come off two of the velcroe strips that hold the watch on your wrist. My husband, who is a hobbyist and good with knowing what to use, has tried a variety of different glues, but they don't last. I tried to contact the manufacturer, but they are somewhere in the Far East. I've come up with a system of paper clips and clasps that I have to use to keep it on.I would'nt go to this trouble if it didn't help. I just wish it was a bit more sturdy."
175746,0,"After my trusty Norelco finally gave up the ghost, I decided to try the Remington R-960. The reviews were excellent, so I figured that I couldn't lose. Well my results were mixed.It does give a great shave, and it takes much less time to shave with the Remington. But the battery pack is wimpy. You have to charge it every week, where my Norelco would go for 2-3 weeks between charges. You can't run it while it's plugged in; technically it works, but the manual says that this is bad for the battery. (So what's the point of having a corded razor if it's bad for the thing to be used that way? Might as well just use a charging cradle.) In my experience, the best shave is the first one after a full charge, after that the razor gets gradually slower and slower, and the performance goes downhill.Another problem: the low battery light on mine doesn't work. Not a big deal, but it doesn't say much about Remington's quality control process.This razor was much lighter than my old Norelco, and now I see why, it's got a smaller battery. Overall, it's a pretty good razor, and not bad for the money. But if you can afford it, consider getting a better quality razor."

50421,0,"I usually take a few Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) to help me get to sleep but wanted to switch to something else and thought Melatonin would probably be a better fit. It does seem to put me to sleep just as well as the Diphenhydramine but it does leave a 'hangover' effect when I wake up, even if I get a full 8 hours of sleep. Going to probably continue using the Diphenhydramine and maybe the Melatonin when I can actually sleep in for more hours to avoid the hangover effect."
204345,0,I love to sleep with the sound of the seashore...but this machine kept me awake because the seagulls are too loud and sound very shrill. I took it back and bought Homedics SS 3000 Sound Spa Lullaby...with it's seashore sound (seagulls are barely heard in the distance) I literally sleep like a baby!!!It also has 3 interchangeable discs that shine images on the ceiling or tilt it toward the wall. Great nightlight if you need it or you can turn it off.
50473,0,"I already knew the product and it was only a new purchase. My doctor recommends, but I don`t see the effects. Another point is that although the delivery took place on the date scheduled, the time of delivery is too long. If you travel in the USA, as was my case, there is a risk of not receiving the product on time you need."

I would recommend the very soft and then soft first.4 stars because the one I bought from Brookstone many years ago had a slightly better tactile feel and better grip, but these are fine too."

396156,0,Having read many outstanding reviews I purchased about 6 of these back in December. Though used regularly I am not certain the costs are justified by the minimal impact of my mold and pollen allergies.
367887,1,"We put a commercial toilet back into service after several years of sitting dormant with the water line still connected. The bowl was predictably a mess, but cleaned up fairly well. There were, however, some rust stains on the bottom where the water exits the bowl, and they gave the appearance of being something other than rust.After trying various types of scrubbers and cleansers, I ordered one of these. The rust was gone in a matter of minutes, with no damage to the white porcelain.My only words of caution would be for owners of colored toilets. The Pumie may be too abrasive for some finishes, so you should probably test it underneath the rim where the porcelain can't normally be seen."

167742,0,"I bought my WDF-1600 in Feb. of 2008 and upon writing this it is January 18, 2010. For about 21 months the shaver worked like a champ. I'd purchased it as a replacement for my far more expensive model, which ran about 3x the price and did about the same job. Both electric razors gave me a close shave every time, both were rechargeable. Here's was the clincher. This model (WDF 1600) started dying on me after 21 months of moderate use and by month 23 it was so unreliable that I'm back online looking for a new one. Adding insult to injury, these things are built such that you can't even go in and try to replace the battery, assuming that's the root of the problem...There will be a lot more research done before another model shows up on my credit card bill. Not even 2-years' use, and it already needs to be replaced. Does anyone build anything to last anymore?"
154681,0,Product is ok if you are looking for a quick reference. I ended up returning it because it would not withstand the frequent use that will be required of the test.

148053,0,"I purchased these to power my Apple Magic Mouse. With regular AA batteries, my mouse was powered for about one month. These rechargeable AA batteries are holding up about 10 days. A bit of a disappointment but I guess that is the tradeoff for being able to reuse them over and over. Charging is quick and my devices are operating just as they did with non-rechargeable batteries, with the exception of longevity. I will be buying more of these, but might checkout reviews on other brands first."
174615,0,"I got this today and tried it - taste is not so good. I did what others said - mix with orange juice. But I had to mix it in a blender - does not blend easily with just the stir method. I have felt better and have more energy today than I normally do. So, we'll see how it does.**** Follow-up to my previous review****I could not stomach this stuff - it was so gross. BLAH!!!"
358857,0,I was excited when I read the other reviews on this product and couldn't wait to try this. I have a severe back injury that keeps me in quite a bit of pain creating spasms in my upper back. I took this product and did get a bit of relief. I was hoping it would relieve the spasms enough that I could go off prescription meds. It didnt help quite that much. This product may well be what you are looking for if you have cramps and spasms if they are not as severe as mine are (a 10 on a scale of 1-10).
62027,0,"I know it is an infant bath but still, this seems a little small compared to the other infant tubs that I've used. The toy is nice but I'm afraid we'd be over the infant tub by the time she was old enough to play with it."
78894,0,"This is a very good blood pressure machine if you intend to use as a standalone device. The USB cord that comes with the kit allowing you to connect to your home PC is junk. The USB connector for the PC side is a standard USB connector which works fine - the connector to the blood pressure machine is the most fragile connector I have ever seen on consumer electronics. I had to use a 15 power magn glass to see the 4 tiny, tiny pin connectors that you have to plug into in order for it to work with the computer. I'm a computer guy - so connectors are all in a days work - this one would be hard to hook up in a lab with good eyes - I can't think of my mom trying to plug it in at 70 years old.Avoid if you are buying to use with a PC until they fix the connector to a standard plug that anyone can push in. I took my back to Costco."

358993,0,"I have used a HoMedics Therap Back Brace for years. After years of use I needed to purchase a new one. The original one had a pack of magnets that were placed in the pouch but could be removed if not needed. This one lookS similar but the magnets are not visible and cannot be removed. On the box it states: MAGNETS SHOULD NOT BE USED BY INDIVIDUALS USING PACEMAKERS, INSULIN PUMPS, TRANSDERMAL DRUG DELIVERY PATCHES OR DURING PREGNANCY. NEVER PLACE OVER AN OPEN WOUND.....It also states that the magnets should not be washed, but where are the magnets?. Since I have a pacemaker I am concerned. I was able to wash my old brace so I think I will wash this one and hopefully I will be able to use it. For a back support I would give it 5 stars Because of the warning I will only give it 3 stars........"
329668,1,"The balm melts a bit when applied, coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but isn't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents aren't as strong as others but they're pretty true to their name :) Dessert/creamy ones tend to be ""weaker"" and citrus/tangy ones are stronger. My favorites (I'm a fruity/tangy lover) are midori and gummy bear."
247648,2,"Pretty disappointed with this product as the shaver portion (the part you can take out and clean) did not stay in place after a few months. For the first few months it was great. When it started to get stuck IN my hair (detached and stuck there) when I was shaving, I stopped using it. Either don't waste your money or don't take out the top to clean it."
396042,0,"It is a well made item, but it clearly isn't made to be used for the primary purpose of my purchase, which was to rest between my knees while asleep."
161137,0,"Bought these for my dog as recommended by my vet. He's losing mobility in his back legs due to arthritis.Buying through Amazon is way cheaper than buying the exact same thing through the vet for five times as much.Can't review the results of the product yet (I will edit the review once the pills are used up in three months to see if my dog had any improvement), but the packaging was horrible.The foam seal at the top of the bottle wasn't glued on. Had I bought these in a store for a human, contamination would be a big worry and I would have returned them. Since it came from a warehouse, and the plastic ring on top was still on I figured it was safe and started giving them to my dog. I poured them all out and made sure there was nothing odd in the package before giving them to him though.The factory needs to check their packaging on these and make sure it's done right. These should have never left the factory like this.FOLLOWUP: May 2012, after using up the bottle on my dog, two pills per day as instructed, it has made no improvement to his mobility after three months. Not even a little. He's not any more flexible or showing less symptoms of his joint issues. I won't be buying another bottle."
335050,0,"For the price, I think this model is good. We had one that lasted for more than 3 years. After the first year, the tube started to leak. Howevere, it still functioned well.

183163,1,"I noticed quite a few reviewers were commenting on the smell????? I noticed enough comments that I curiously smelled the product when it arrived...I didnt notice any FOUL odor as others described. I used the product and it performed as most others describe. SUPERBE. Gives a great lather when applied on top of Proraso pre shave cream. Even after use (wet) I didnt notice any unwelcome odor. Not sure what others are talking about. This is an outstanding product. Firm bristles exfoliate and lather unsurpassed by boar bristle brushes. I am also following recommendations to a ""T""......which is DO NOT.... Allow this to dry upside down on its handle. Either find/buy a brush hanger, or dry on its side. Also the most affordable badger brush on the market."
242,0,"This is a good toy. It has powerful vibrations and the speed and intensity of the rotating beads are equally as strong. This vibe is made of a kind of hard rubber (not so hard that it would hurt you). I was hoping it was jelly instead but it's still worth the money. Other than that my only complaint is that I wish it had the pulsating feature, but I can't really complain because for the amount of money you spend on this toy you will def be satisfied."

370595,0,"Refresh Plus Lubricant Eye Drops for sensitive eyes by Allergan state that they are preservative free. They are moisture drops intended for use for dry eyes, including Lasik dryness, and are here packaged as 70 sterile single-use containers of 0.01 fl. oz. (0.4 mL) each. I am bothered by pretty much year-round allergies. Furthermore, I do too much close work, and spend too much time over this computer, so my eyes are always itchy, and sometimes sore. I use Zaditor, another, formerly prescription product daily for the itching, but in recent times have also begun using an artificial tears product daily for eye lubrication. This is the first time I have tried this specific product in this packaging and I don't care for it.The instructions are to twist and pull tab to remove in order to open the ampoule. However, after you do that, you are leaving a rough edge on the lip of the ampoule, and I, for one, have to handle it with care, it is uncomfortable to use around the sensitive eyelid skin. Also, there is really too much liquid in each packet for a single use. Either the liquid runs down your face, or you must discard it, which is wasteful, or, if you're at home, you could keep open, half-full containers around, which would surely be messy and inconvenient. At least for home use, I strongly prefer the ordinary little eye drop bottles."

92257,0,"I'm currently trying out some samples of this product my dentist's assistant gave me. I have just started using it, so I'm not sure if it will be effective, but my main problem with it is that it's hard to put in. You have to push the rubber device in and slide the outside off, keeping the inside in. This is tricky, and I've failed to do it properly the three times I've tried it now, opting to push it on with my fingers instead because the tray doesn't separate from the inside adhesive stuff."
271858,0,"I have had my floor mate since Christmas. I love the way it cleans. It DOES leave my floors beautiful. On the otherhand. It is a PAIN to lug around. It is pretty heavy considering a swiffer wet jet does about the same job. I use the floormate about once a month for kitchen tile and hardwoods throughout the house. Otherwise, it is much easier to just get out the wet mop for everyday dirt. &#60;br /&#62;To sum it up...too expensive for what it does...still have to clean up the machine afterwards."
117228,0,"I am of the personal opinion that nobody should be using an alcohol based aftershave, as this will severely dry out your skin. I purchased this thinking I was buying the balm, as the product description was rather vague - Amazon has since revised it. If your skin can tolerate the alcohol, and you don't mind the stinging associated with it, the fragrance is as wonderful as the Issey Miyake EDT, but toned down a smidgen."

321937,0,"This product didn't cure me of anything nor do I think it is designed to. I know that it makes great amount of gas in my stomach cuz I eventually have to poop in about 2 hours after taking this. It does help a little with digestion and regularity only because of FOS content in the mix. And no it didn't create any magical energy or boost. Not sure how other people get that boost without a source of carb or triglycerides in the mix. I do, however, take it for my daily veggie content. I hate veggies and this one has a good amount.For the rest of the ""claims,"" I'd say a placebo can work miracles."

383381,0,Bought this for my wifes grandfather. He has a degenerative eye disease that is cousing him to lose his sight. His eye sight had gotten so bad that he could no longer see the text in his books. This magnafier did help alot. I will say that it is a little funky to use. You do have to adjust it a little to be able to read through it. It does work well after you get it set in the right spot for your eyes.
411847,0,this item matches our stainless kitchen very well. this lil guy gets used daily. the only thing I have against it is that the rubber cap on the top will wear out from use and you end up with it now squirting because the crack in the top creates a air leak. so what we have done is buy the cheapo white ones and use the rubber cap from it on our stainless unit.
114191,0,I've been using this for over 2 weeks now and I have to say that the flavor is real bad. I have to put lots of fruit in the blender for it to go down easy. It also will not blend with a fork or wisp. It must be blended at high speed for sure or it just clumps up. I'll probably try another brand after this is finished.
164885,0,"Ordered these large Salonpas Patches with some other items, good price for the 5 pack.They don't stick as well as the small Salonpas patches, at least not for me. I've had no problems with the small ones coming off, in fact once they get done doing their (on my sensitive skin) burning/icing and just work into the painful area, I forget they're on! The large ones? can only use if I'm going to be very quiet in the house, quiet as in not trying to move around much. When I do get them to stick, they work the same as the small ones, meaning yeah, they help. I know it's topical/external and these patches aren't anywhere near a ""cure"" for what ails me, but they use menthol, Menthyl Salicylate and Camphor so once I get past the burning my skin (ymmv), I love the icy cold sensation without the goopy, sticky creams and gels if I do have to leave the house. Oh and yes you will smell the menthol (or is it the camphor?) when using the Salonpas patches, but that's a smell I personally do not mind.Seller sent as promised, but I ordered these on 7/21, they weren't sent out until 7/31, not sure why it took 10 days to put the 5 packs in an envelope and get them out to me."
310045,0,The towel only comes in red and bleeds when washed. It also bleeds onto white colored dogs. The dog is now nicknamed Pinky. Even though cleaned several times it still does this.

246187,0,"I am in school for massage and I wanted to have some at home relief from constantly using my back muscles. This massager does provide some relief, but it does NOT feel even close to a real massage. The heat is weak, and the pad smells like chemicals, and makes my skin itchy. After sitting on the pad for 10 minutes or so, my back does feel relaxed, but I am all itchy and my clothes smell!!! I would not order this online unless you know someone with it so you can try it out. It was definitely worth the $49 I paid for it, but it is usually $117."
248317,0,"Summery: This product is great when used for intended purpose, however its cheap construction means it has a limited life span.PROS:*** It is gentle and easy to use on very hard to reach places.CONS:*** After about 2 years of use the button broke, stuck in the depressed position, meaning I can no longer turn the thing on.*** Its great for soft body hair, not great for anything above the neck.REVIEW: Initially this seemed like a great purchase, it shaves reasonably close but at no danger of nicking the skin no matter what awkward angle you use. It seems simple and sturdy and easy to clean. No one wants details as to where and how this product was used, but I will say if you're hoping for a multitasking razor this isn't it. I would occasionally use this guy to trim my beard when I had one, and it worked okay, but sometimes snag the larger hairs, needed multiple passes, etc. This isn't a big deal, I think you need the right tools for the job and prefer this being a good body hair trim and sub-par beard trimmer than having something that was average at both.What really lost stars was the product's history of breaking through no fault of the user. Unfortunately, even though it feels pretty sturdy and reliable it WILL end up breaking. Now I know nothing last forever, but I think for an electronics device that costs $40 that one only gently uses for a few minutes every week, it should be functional or repairable for more than a couple years.Sadly Norelco is the only company that makes body hair razors that seem to work well, so I replaced my broken trimmer with a more expensive one hoping it lasts longer. I don't feel good, though, about endorsing Norelco with a repeat purchase."

374230,0,"I gave it 3 stars because I found it hard to wash off my hands after I put it on my face, the Pacific Shaving Company brand, (another vendor) just rinses off with warm water. The reason I find this an issue is, after I put the oil on my face, your hands are now oily and I have to stop to wash them with soap before i shave. Maybe just me."

I'll only repeat this order in cooler weather. I've been eating Clif Builder's Bars for a couple of years now, and they are truly one of the best tasting protein bars on the market.

93548,0,"The batteries were ok. We had two duds out of 20 batteries, so I guess not so bad. The worst part about this product was the free shipping was not free AND I had to drive to the post office to pay the postage and pick up the parcel. The USPS told me that this is not the first time this company has done this and it seems to be a common practice for them..... hmmmmmmm"
108269,0,"The soap manages to work up a fair amount of lather. However, I don't have a fine grade of hair and I've noticed that it just doesn't get as soft using this. Unfortunately, the aerosol can gels, which I'm trying to get away from, make the razors glide more smoothly across my skin."

421367,0,"When I received this item the box was in such poor condition - not from the shipping - and it smelled so toxic it reminded me of war surplus - World War II surplus! Amazon is clearly not fullfilling it's responsibility to check-up on these third party suppliers it has posted on it's web site, this item looks as if it were purchased at a flea market and then sold through Amazon for a premium price. This has happened with my last several purchases from Amazon and I will cease to purchase here anymore if I can possibly find an item elsewhere. Which shouldn't be to difficult."
134701,0,This unit works as promised. Note that I bought it for chronic wound care and not dental care.The one drawback to it is that it makes quite a mess in operation.
18699,0,"The chair is comfortable, but the massage features are pretty subpar and it's not as good as some other massage chairs that I've seen for about 50 more dollars. Nonetheless, it's a good buy if you want basic massage features and can only pay for a normal office chair. If I could go back in time, I would spend a little more money and get something better."
173452,0,"I ordered these in orange because my doctor recommended that I start using a sublingual b complex. Sublingual means that you let the vitamin dissolve under your tongue rather than chewing or swallowing it and this is one of the fastest means of getting the vitamins into your blood stream.I had one tablet this morning after breakfast and I just had the second after dinner. The orange taste is faint, but most of all I taste vitamin. It's bitter. I know that the benefits far outweigh the taste, so I'm going to continue to use them and buy this brand in the future. I just hope that I get used to the taste."
345921,1,Perfect for taller people that need help. Handle is comfortable & it is pretty sturdy as well. It was packaged sturdy too
225090,1,"I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm. The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with, and the product is fantastic. The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous. The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^"
271838,0,"If you're willing to wrangle with it a bit and you can accept water leaking from the reservoir (the valve is faulty), then it does do a good job of washing the floors. We sweep with a broom first, then dry vacuum, then wash.NOTE: The valve leaked because I used a vinegar solution. I'm not happy that this caused the little gasket to deteriorate, but if you use just water or approved liquid, then it's fine."
114792,0,"Bought this to replace an old reliable Grundig shaver that I had been using for many years. The shaver had unfortunately slipped out of my hand one evening, hit the sink hard, and broke. This Braun model is lighter and less bulky than my old one, and shaves faster and closer due to the sharper cutters. This model, however, has a hard plastic removable shield (foil protection cap) that protects the foil/cutter assembly from getting damaged. My old Grundig shaver had a built-in hard rubber wrap-around which was more convenient and easier to apply. My old shaver also had a long-hair trimmer that popped out further, had a wider surface area, and just worker better than this one. On the positive side, this model is easier and faster to clean wayward bristles from."
197284,0,"At first it burnt giving me a clear sinus feel, but it turns out I had a sinus infection, so it had to be used with my antibiotics. I will let you know when my infection is gone how this works. Judging by the burning sensation I would think this would clear up sinus passages with corks in them.LOL"
288162,0,"This kit works great in a pinch. However, I ended up investing in a more durable piece for a more day-to-day use. It's great for taking on trips because it's cheap and it doesn't matter if it gets lost or damaged, but not for primary use."
202686,1,Started using these shortly after I got a job doing landscaping. Use them in the netti pot everyday after work. It's quick and easy and for dumping water through your nose it's fairly comfortable.

261652,0,I ordered the large size bottle because I use a lot of lemon oil. The product is fine but I am disappointed in the fact that the stopper/dropper on the mouth of the bottle was not attached and so now I have to pour from the bottle and it is difficult to judge the amount I am using.
177920,1,"Really cool product. Couldn't wait to receive it. Love it. It took some figuring out how/when to best use the timers. It seems you can either use it to count down for example when baby last had a diaper change, etc., but if you set a timer for that same event, it erases your previous time when the timer goes off. Biggest thing: DON'T DROP IT!!! I mistakenly had it clipped to my belt thinking that the belt clip would hold it. I bent down to pick something up, it popped off, hit the floor, and landed it some way so that it broke the back-light button. Took it apart thinking it would pop back out only to find that nothing would work whatsoever when we screwed it back together. I liked the product enough though to order another one. I intend to give these as gifts for baby showers with the caveat to not drop them."
392365,0,"This lotion keeps my skin really soft all day. I'd put the lotion on right after I shower and put them on before I dry myself. It doesn't make you feel greasy at all.I've tried many different lotion, this is one of the best body lotion. The only down side is the pump doesn't go all the way down to the bottom of the bottle, it's hard to get the lotion out when I have 1/3 left."

The red coloration in beets is a great source of cancer fighting phytonutrients. I tried taking this product for a potential lowering of high blood pressure, but I did not see any results in that area.kone"
122209,1,"This is an excellent toothbrush for the price. If your teeth do not look and feel cleaner after using this thing, then you better take your behind to the dentist for a professional cleaning.I love the two minute feature which gives you the recommended brushing time so you can't even mess that upIt comes apart for easy cleaning and holds a good charge for about two weeks off of the charger.The only thing that is a bit of a bother is that it is smooth on the sides which can get slippery.If you can swing it, get it. Your teeth will love you for it."
364925,0,A bit expensive when 0.5 oz is $8 even in the same Aura Cacia brand. But the roll on bottle is VERY handy for apply lavender neat to the skin.

341127,0,"I've been double edged shaving (DE) for around 3 years now. I've had MANY shaving creams, aftershave balms, and pre-shave oils. I've only had around 3-4 shaving soaps I can remember. You will absolutely love this soap if you are a soap user. It lathers after just a few swirls on my silvertip badger hair brush. It does provide a nice fluffy and somewhat slick cushion to shave on. However, I have very sensitive skin and this leaves me with razor burn after 3 passes. If you can use shaving soap all day long without the worry of razor burn, then this is the soap for you! It looks like it will last at least 4-6 months with daily usage.I now ""super lather"" with this soap by applying a pre-shave oil, then loading my brush up with this soap, then using a great English shaving cream (any English shaving cream will do, i.e. Taylors of Old Bond St., Trumpers, Truefitt & Hill).The only reason why I will not buy this again is because I do not intend to super lather for life every time I shave. I would buy this again if I didn't have sensitive skin. I can tell you that this soap is YEARS ahead of L'Occitane's cade shaving soap and Pre de Provence's shea butter shaving soap since I've already tried them."

209382,0,"It did leave my lips less dry and soft. However, something has to be done about the packaging of this product. It should probably come in some type of small jar or something of that sort. The reason I say this is because it is mixed with oil, so when you squeeze the tube, the oil and sugar scrub seperate. So, you get a whole lot of oil on your finger before you actually get to the scrub.....it did the job but I am still on a search for a better lip scrub. I think I will try the lip scrub by Lush next."
194390,0,"This unit is just OK. average shaving & comfort. If you want a unit that can be cleaned & is water safe, it's good. Nothing to spectacular about the quality of the shave."
410967,0,"I've been using Clean & Easy waxing products for over 10 years. The wax itself is great....but only if heated correctly. When heated correctly it glides right on, and leaves no residue. My previous experience was 2 different Clean & Easy ""Personal"" Waxers. I noticed one of them stopped heating well. When the wax isn't warm enough, it is sticky and pulls and is difficult to remove. So, thinking my unit was worn out, I bought another. I noticed it stopped heating well within months. Upon further examination, both heaters had one side that stopped heating. Like a toaster where only one side works. So for several years I used a microwave to heat the rollers instead. This is 1) dangerous as the wax can overheat, and 2) make makes the roller difficult to hold.So, sucker that I am, bought this ""Portable"" unit a few weeks ago. I liked that it holds the ""large"" refills as the large size (as opposed to ""personal"" size) is the only size that I can buy in my area beauty stores. This unit NEVER gets the wax hot enough, even after an hour of heating. So, I've had to resort to putting the roller in the microwave for an additional 30 seconds. I am SO bummed. I love the wax product but the heaters are too cheap and inconsistent to do the job of melting and heating the wax. I'm back to the microwave method. Again, NOT recommended as the product is not intended for heating in the microwave. But I have many rollers to use up."
337663,1,I gave it to my mother for Christmas. I wasn't prepared for her joy at receiving this mirror.The 7X magnification is great. Most other mirrors are not that strong.
321813,0,"Though the mat is good and definitely one of the least expensive, it is not durable. The first time I used it, I was wearing exercise shoes and after I finished some core workouts, there were little purple bits of the mat that had come off all over my floors. Granted, it is a yoga mat and generally you're not wearing shoes for yoga, but I also use it for core exercises and parts of my circuit training. It's great as long as I take off my shoes (which is a pain if I'm doing circuits) and as long as I don't let my baby get grab it (he's able to pick off pieces too ... and he's 6 months old)."
29505,0,"Not the best quality but it works - as another poster mentioned, the round rubber ends fall off. However, the tuning fork works well, and as long as you don't lose your rubber ends you're in business. If you're super picky, don't get it. However, for me it gets the job done, so I'm happy."

29031,0,"The Cruder is just a mediocre razor and a less than mediocre trimmer. I purchased it as a replacement to my travel razor and thought the trimmer would be an added bonus. Its okay for occasional use but for everyday, consider getting something better because with the Cruder, you are getting what you paid for."
231385,0,"Maybe I'm biased due to not having plumbing that's very prone to clogging; maybe I'm also somewhat biased due to the fact that I also often use toilet paper as facial tissue in place of Kleenexes (where higher durability might be desired).The trade-off of the rapid-dissolving feature seemingly is that the paper is REALLY thin...and sometimes it might dissolve before you'd like it to. So, I found myself going through the rolls pretty quickly, probably having been conditioned to use a lot at a time in compensation.It works, though, especially once you get used to it."
98156,2,"As my title says, I love the toothbrush that fits these replacement brushes but I'm seriously thinking about not buying a new one after my current one goes. I've used this system since 1995 but it is so frustrating, and getting more so, to find replacement heads that it's simply not worth it. I know I can get them from conair but why should I have to pay shipping for something that I should be able to find in just about any drugstore. I live in New Jersey relatively close to NYC, you think it wouldn't be a problem - but it is. This is the first review I've ever written about anything - it's just that aggravating."

Sometimes I'll leave it on for a few hours while I do housework, and rinse it out for the BEST looking hair!This is the best item in my beach bag. Before when i would go to the beach, my hair would always have that salt water stuck in it, and look messy if I couldn't rinse it out right away. A pain when we just go to the beach for the day and want to go out for dinner after! Now, I'll wet my hair before we leave (per the directions) slather this in and braid my medium length hair. When I'm done with the salt water for the day, I unbraid my hair and have beautiful soft, touchable beach wavy hair!The only problem I have with this product is I wish it was easier to find!

I had to stop several times in the middle of a race to rewrap it."
317017,0,"This warmer works well, but requires replacement pillows to keep the wipes moist without drying out. They state to re-wet periodically (which I do almost weekly) and replace every 3 months, but they get old about every 6 weeks and the wipes(especially generic brand wipes) start to dry out. This warmer is one of the higher priced ones and the refill pillows are an added expense. I recommend buying a wipe warmer that heats from the top (these are the only wipes that need to be warm anyhow!) The white and teal munchkin one heats from the top and I have heard it works great."

76993,0,"My 4 year old child is very sensitive to noise and cannot sleep without this machine. The first one we bought in 2007 worked wonderfully, and lasted nearly 2 years with very heavy usage (lots of naps plus bedtime). Since then, the quality has gone downhill. Even though we are using it much less, the machine lasts 6 months at the most. This is a lot of money for a fan that won't run longer than a few months. But our child can't sleep without it, and mommy needs sleep."

106155,1,"I bought this three months ago mainly to whiten my teeth. I had to get used to the taste and how it made me feel like I was in a horror movie whenever I brushed, plus my sister made a lot of fun of me for getting this. But after brushing with it, my teeth looked GREAT - they were much whiter and shinier. When my sister noticed how much better my teeth looked, she stopped making fun of me started to use this stuff. I've noticed it doesn't whiten my teeth as much as it did in the beginning but perhaps my teeth are as white as this is going to make them. :) Since I've become used to all the cons of this product, the only things that still bother me about this is how you have to brush for a lot longer to get rid of all the black (maybe that's why my teeth are so much shinier) and how you get black gunk under your gums."
317151,0,"I bought this for my little one who had a winter birthday while we were living in a cold climate. I thought that perhaps diaper changes would be a little less traumatic if the wipes weren't so cold. I discovered that it didn't really make a difference and he cried just the same. It did a good job of keeping the wipes warm, but by the time you get to the bottom of the wipes, they were mostly dried out (and ""reconstituting"" dry wipes just isn't the same.) There is a sponge inside the warmer that you need to ensure stays moist all the time that is supposed to help I presume... it just seemed like it wasn't worth the money overall."

14811,2,"It seemed like it was a deal to buy this product from Amazon as opposed to the manufacturer becasue Amazon claims they include the optional finger sensor, which alone could cost another $20.However, my package did NOT include the finger pulse sensor as was advertised. When I contacted customer service, they said they were too busy to send me the finger pulse sensor, and instead suggested that I take more of my time to package and return the item for an exchange or for my money back minus a 20% restocking fee. I attached what they sent me below.Amazon's customer service should be ashamed of their response. I may have to cancel scheduled sessions with clients depending on how long Amazon takes to send me my new package. Amazon's customer service responded to me ""As I'm sure you can understand, our Fulfillment Centers are vast, and we process thousands of orders each day."" No Amazon, I don't understand??? You are busy because customers like me are giving you business, and when you screw up, you put the responsability on customers like me to fix it?At this point Amazon, the only way I can think to fix this problem is by not burdening you with anymore of my business that apparently keeps you from properly fulfilling orders and fixing your mistakes. Next time I'll spend the extra $20 and buy the product directly from the manufacturer as someone who values reliability and being valued as a customer at a time when every dollar counts.Amazon's Response to me:Hello,I am sorry to hear about the problem you experienced with your shipment. It is certainly not our intention to ship defective products to our customers.We always appreciate customer input on how we can improve our store, and I've forwarded your message to our shipping department.I'm not able to replace individual ""finger pulse sensor"" from a set, but I'll replace the set for you. Once you've received it, please ship back the original set. As I'm sure you can understand, our Fulfillment Centers are vast, and we process thousands of orders each day.

228324,0,Product did the job rather well. Very sharp. Was a little disappointed with the vendor's claim that clipper was manufactured in the USA. It in fact is manufactured in China.

326776,2,I wouldn't buy this again. It didn't help my headache. This stuff is made from a weed. Look up a picture of wild lettuce on google. It grows everywhere where i live in california. If you like it you can make it yourself. But I hated it. The only thing I felt was the alcohol they put in it (and stupid for wasting my money). Nothing like the discription I read online. People say it is opiate-like painkiller. Not true. Don't try this if you are in pain. You will be extreally diappointed. I was.

It just isn't big enough.I use this organizer to put both my Lantus and Novolog insulin pens in and a handful of needles and some alcohol wipes so I can throw the whole thing in my computer bag when I'm out working.

150056,0,"I got this thing as my kit for 2-3 hiking trips. As my small crew's designated ""medic"" (basically the guy most comfortable with first aid, and by far the most training), I have been satisfied with this kit. While I've luckily not had to use it often in it's intended role, the few times that I have busted it out it's proved to be ideal.It's primary focus is on common bandages, but that's the thing you're going to use the most and I appreciate that they didn't skimp out. There's also a number of ""one off"" items (Cold pack, thermometer, Survival blanket, Trauma pad) that are situational in nature, but still important to have 'just in case...' It is by no means a comprehensive kit for anything outside of basic first aid, but it gives enough capability that it gives me confidence hiking this thing into the woods with two firecraft freaks who tend to find new and interesting ways to cut themselves.Critical Analysis:-It does provide far more bandages than you could reasonably expect to expend compared to antiseptic wipes and antibiotic ointments. I added in a tube of Neo.-The tweezers are laughable (cheep cheep cheep plastic) and I threw them away in favor of cheep metal ones from a drug store.-The scissors cut, but it's worth seeing if they cut well enough for you, or replacing them with something more to your taste.-The soft case is cheep, but it works and organizes the pack well. I tend to drop the whole kit into a gallon freezer style ziplock bag for some added water resistance.-Kit includes Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, but no antihistamine.-Two mini rolls of 'medical' tape are not very wide at all, good for bandage tie down, but bad for any kind of 'ace' bandage like wrapping. I threw in a small roll of athletic tape to augment it.Conclusion:If you get this kit, expect to change out a few things, add a few things, and tailor it to what you're doing. It will give you a solid foundation to build on, and for 90% of what you need, it's got you covered fine."

364366,0,"I bought the cream. But when I opened up the box, I was surprised that it didn't come with a description of the ingredients that made up the cream. This made me very suspicious of the quality of the cream. Honestly, I read the other customers' comments, I am highly doubtful as to whether they were written by ""real"" customers like me. They sound like promotional language."
309641,1,Used Braun Flex Control (6550 model) for the past 6 years. Recently switched to Braun 8995 360 Complete. What a difference 6 years make in shaving technology! Best shaver that I have ever owned. The shave is so close and precise... Wonder if any shaver can get better than the 8995. Well worth your money.

9484,0,"**Upfront advice:I guess I'll have to be one of the few voices of dissent about this product. This is a nice shaving cream, but for me, it didn't live up to the expectations I got from reading all the glowing reviews. Shavers with tough beards and sensitive skin, beware.**Positives:TH Ultimate Comfort lathers well. Using a Simpson Commodore 3x brush I can whip up a mighty lather in no time. The smell is pleasant, a very light lavender that I can detect only while shaving.**Negatives:TH does not provide adequate razor glide and protection for me, especially for multiple passes. I shave with a Merkur Futur at setting 3 to 4 using Feather blades. By two passes after the first I can feel the blade begin to drag and irritate my skin. This no doubt has something to do with the fact that, while TH gives a big lather, that lather begins to flatten and thin rather quickly. Decreasing the amount of water to form a denser lather helps somewhat depending on where on my face I'm shaving, but means I must use a little more product to get enough lather for a shave. Even making the lather quite dense, the sensitive skin on my neck is visibly irritated after I shave with TH. I'm also more prone to cuts using this cream.To compare, Musgo Real, my current favorite cream, gives me three reliably comfortable passes after the first, and the irritation on my neck is considerably less. Likewise, I cut myself less using Musgo.**Bottom line:I wanted to like this cream, but it just doesn't provide enough protection for my skin."

149378,0,"I was so excited to find this creme on amazon for less than it costs in my local store. The old JASON Ester C moisturizing creme was my very favorite facial moisturizer ever. Unfortunately, when this arrived I was disappointed to find that JASON has changed the formula.The new formula is ok, but it's not as nice as the old formula. It's not as nice on my skin. . . I can't quite place the difference. . . and while I LOVED the old fragrance, the new citrus fragrance isn't as pleasing. I will have to renew my search for the perfect facial moisturizer, because this new formula just doesn't do it for me. :(To Amazon's credit, when I complained that the creme I'd received was NOT the same as the creme described here, they promptly refunded my money. So I remain a loyal Amazon customer, even if I was disappointed with this purchase."
111172,0,"I believe this is to make you aware to pull your shoulders back. It somewhat digs into your underarm even with holding shoulders back, less painful when you wear a shirt underneath.

I asked my gynae if being on the pill this long will delay my ttc chances... she said it shouldn't matter and I could get pregnant in a couple of months. I read though in books that what the pill actualls does is to make your cervical mucus hostile to sperm and the endometrium too thin for implantation.My husband and I are still consuming the respective FertilAid products in hope that maybe we'll be lucky one day with our very own bundle of joy!Will update if there are any changes!"

275613,0,"I am a diet bar junkie, my favorite ones are the ones that taste great but leave you full, rather than yearning for another snack 20 minutes later. These ones are quite small (about a 1/3 of a Luna bar) with 120 calories, a gooey caramel filling which is quite chewy, and a chocolate like outer shell. They are quite yummy but just don't taste ""real"" --not worth the 120 calories and they totally don't fill you up, and usually i reach for another snack soon after. If you have 120 calories to waste, just go for some very satisfying chocolate, or a few nuts."
249133,0,"I find that the smallest setting--#1--does not give a real stubble shave. After about five-days without shaving, the trimmer would not cut anything when set at #1. The only way I can get a closer shave is to take the head attachment off and shave with the blade exposed, but this can result, and has resulted, in bald spots where I've tipped the blade too close to my face. This also defeats the vacuum function."
344132,0,"This erosive therapy does work for small warts. Basically it suffocates and erodes the wart, eventually leading to tissue inflammation and necrosis. For larger warts the acid will hardly penetrate to enough depth to bring notable effects. If you have a wart larger than half of the size of your little fingernail, try freezing or laser removal."
303576,0,"I have a very stiff knee from ATL replacement surgery back in the 80's. Ever since then I've needed support on that knee for comfort in movement. I have used the Ace elastic knee support and the Cho-Pat. And really, the Ace does a little better job for me. But it's nice to have an alternate method once in a while. Plus the Cho-pat can be more comfortable in hot weather, since it doesn't cover so much skin.In recent years the quality of the Cho-pat has gone down. I suppose that happened upon switching manufacturing to China. The Cho-pat used to be softer and more supple. Now, in comparison, the straps are rather stiff and the velcro can't hold the very ends of the straps down around the curve of the leg. That knocked my rating down one star."

327429,0,"The initial quality of the product was great, but after some washings the seams near the top of the stocking have started to come apart with long strings needing to be clipped off. I do not believe this product will last too long; and given the price and the need to wear this type of product daily, I am very disappointed with the durability that I have seen from this pair."
46007,0,I wear these when I play golf on those hot and humid days. The work ok but the small thin ice packs melt in less than 1/2 hour. Sometimes it takes 6 of the ice packs to get me through a round. The packs are also a bit of a pain to poke into the bandanna. The concept is good but they are a bit awkward to use.
410783,0,I subscribe for this product for the savings however somehow the taste is not the same from when I order directly from the manufacturer or from another seller. I feel a little bit leary about ordering again.
157443,0,"I really like this item. The only things that kept me from giving it 5 stars: 1.Shaving can does not lock completely 360 degrees, 0nly 180 degrees. 2. I have not been able to switch all the way to Gel without having the can disconnect; only half way for 2/3 gel, 1/3 lather. 3. The same thing happens when I use the ""PUSH"" button. 4. Lather will not get hot continuously when I push the black dispense button. I must wait a short time and push again. It helps a little if I turn on the machine before I get into the shower so that I can shave afterward.Other than these things, I can live with how it works for what my major need is."

187921,0,"I'm 13 and I recenly bought the Rasera bladeless version of Veet... it DID remove, but left my skin drier then usual and it looked like my skin had holes in it! So overall, I would say this product was satisfactory... it also left my skin with this strange smell that I did not like... and after I spread it around with my hands and washed it off [my hands], they were all rubbery and smelly! Yuck, that was disgusting, but it did take off the hair on my legs, but the skin was TOO smooth for me and I was not very much used to it...If you just want to remove the hair on your legs and you're not picky about the smell or anything else, go ahead and buy this... but then if you're very fussy about how it turns out, then think about buying the product before you actually buy it! That's all I'm saying..."
260305,0,"I know I am sensitive to nickel and had bought a pair of silver earrings recently. The result when wearing them is the severe allergic reaction I get when wearng anything with a nickel content. So, I found this test kit, which arrived quickly and securely packaged. The bottle that contains a clear liquid smealls like it is amonia. You place several drops of this liquid on a q-tip swab, then rub on the metal item for 20 to 30 seconds. A pink color is supposed to develop on the swab if it is possitive for nickel. I tested the earrings in question and a grayish-slightly pink color developed, and I am not sure what that means. If something tests positive, there is a bottle of a clear nail varnish to apply to the jewelry piece to prevent a nickel reaction. I dont' know what you would do about a reaction to the nail varnish, though.There is nothing else on the market for consumers to test for nickel and I really can't say that this product is effective."
322695,1,"This is a tricky review to make. I gave it five starts because I use it on lifting days and it's great for that purpose. The problem is, if you're looking to use it to supplement energy/ease nerves throughout the day, you might want to look for a time-release formula. It enters your system quickly, but leaves just as quick (4 hours, max). So to sum it up, good for use before a workout (lifting, cardio, zumba, whatever), but not great for a ""push me through the day, so I don't feel like a wreck come 4 o'clock"" supplement."
338513,0,I bought the first one of these a year ago and it split and started leaking in 2 months. It was replaced without a problem. The second one started to leak after 10 months. It's a nice product but it will not last long with daily use.

263915,0,"My daughter came into contact with headlice at a sleepover recently. After checking my entire family we found five actual lice amongst us which were killed upon treatment. I did find some nits scattered in my childrens hair and was fearful that they would hatch and create more lice so I purchased the robi comb. I ran the comb through their hair and when it ran across a nit nothing happened. I thought perhaps I had a defective comb, but then read that it only works on actual hatched lice. So as far as preventing lice from hatching (which is why I initially purchased it) it really does nothing."

If you add skim milk instead of water, and mix and shake it well, you can treat yourself to an indulgent drink without feeling guilty about how many calories you're taking in. I also find that if you use skim milk instead of water, your hunger is put off longer and you are less tempted to snack before your next meal. I would definitely recommend this as a once-a-day meal replacement if you are trying to lose weight. Great source of healthy protein!"

The only alcohol free and fragrance free deodorant which I have ever found that does work is Trader Joe's deodorant (the one in the blue and white package) (and if Amazon sold it I would buy it from them)."

116574,0,"I think the experience with this inserts depends on a few things: male vs female, size of your foot, and weight. What you get are relatively thin rubber cups to place in the back of your shoe. For a man, the side are very thin and makes it hard to slip your foot into the shoe without completely unlacing. The waffling you see in the picture is actually thickest part of the cup. I found for me the cups moved around in my shoe during the day and required several adjustments. They increased the pitch of my shoe forward and eventually caused front toe pain. I removed them and was back to status quo. So for me these are ""okay"" nothing special, on par with what you find at the drug store."

They will attempt to transfer you. You might even be able to leave a message for an Andrew. You will NEVER get a call back. That's NEVER. The controls on my chair are intermittently failing. The chair is almost new. I would never buy anything again with the brand name Comfort Products. Buy it and you're on your own. JM"
287962,0,"For most people this worked for me it didn't so well, but it helped. I think this is a grate alternative to drugs and it seems to work for some. My problem with it is that the battery presses in on the bottom and it is not waterproof! For something that is made to use on a boat it should be waterproof but there is no gaskets or anything to keep the water out and it got in. Come on $5 watches these days are water resistant. Anyhow it got returned but still may be a good choice if it works for you."

I could hardly walk - the material should be softer!
349512,1,"I upgraded to the the OneTouch UltraSmart meter after being an Ultra user for 1.5 years after getting diabetes. Being my third meter, I have to say-- without a doubt-- that it is the best I've used to date. The PDA functionality is utterly useful, especially for those who have been unable to commit to a paper logbook or who don't want to spend the money on the proprietary interface cable.The only reason I gave this meter four stars instead of a fifth is because of the case. It is a little firmer than the Ultra case (which I personally like), but for those trying to fit the case in a small jacket pocket it is a tad more difficult. Also (this is the primary reason I didn't add the fifth star) the test strip tube location is horrendous. The way that LifeScan builds the tubes, they have this ridge that juts out which makes it easier to open. For my Ultra case, I could fold the ridge down on the side. For the UltraSmart case, the loop is in a totally different position, which forces the ridge against either the meter or the finger-pricker. There didn't seem to be a ""good"" position to put the test strip tube in.Overall, however, I still love the meter itself. It's quick and fast. After hours of flipping through options, the battery life still is running strong. Alsom, the backlight is a dream. It comes in handy in places like dark theaters where light is often absent.One final contention I have with the meter is one of the options on the meter is ""Help."" When I was wondering how to change menu settings, I selected it, and a dialog box popped up telling me to access the manual or LifeScan's website. How useful of a help feature is that? Common sense would have said to either include a help system or don't even put the word in at all. Without the ""Help"" option, the primary text dialog wouldn't even need to scroll. Just a small critique from a UI (user interface) perspective.Let me reiterate that this is still-- despite the test tube location on the case and the perplexing help feature-- the best meter on the market today."

We have had this happen with these blades before - and contacted Gillette directly ourselves, and they replaced them! It's not the vendor's fault - this isa problem with Gillette.

362088,0,"""Ableware Wheelchair Cup Holder - 706220001On a walker, the cup holder is too flimsy. I wouldn't put anything made of glass or pottery in it. It will hold a 20 oz. plastic bottle, but I always put tops back on.It's EASY to uninstall for cleaning. However, if the main clamp is too big for the tube, you're in for a bit of work.

61980,2,"This is my second tub I have tried... first off, its only $30 at wal-mart, so if you're still interested, buy it there.There are a few problems with this tub:First, the pillow is useless- you can't wash the baby's hair when the pillow is there, and if you flip it up, it falls back down in the baby's face. I had to cut it off.Second, as the baby gets bigger and you still need to use the sling, her back hits the seat below and hurts her. I had to hold her up with one hand and bathe her with the other.So, I tried using the tub without the sling. She is only 2 months, but can lay it the tub/seat just fine. The only problem is that it doesnt seem comfortable for her, and her head rests higher than the seat, which means when I wash her hair, the water doesn't flow into the tub, but onto the counter instead.This tub only worked well for the first few weeks. Now I am off to find another!"

19113,0,"I used the ovulation prediction kit from this company, which worked great. Very clear control and test lines. It was very easy to see when the LH surge occurred. Since the pregnancy tests were so cheap, I tested early (10 DPO), and it seemed like I always got a negative result. On 14 DPO (28 day cycle), when I officially became late I seemed to get another negative result; however, when I came back about 10 min later, there was a very faint positive line. I was not sure what to make of the result, so I figured I will test a couple days later.On day 30, I tried again. After 10 min extremely faint line. I decided to take the same urine sample and buy a First Response test. Within 10 seconds I got a clear distinct positive result.In summary, these tests are a great value and much better to the environment (as no plastic casing). I just wish they were as clear as the ovulation tests or some of the brand name tests. Maybe I was not patient enough to wait for the line."

Although this is the link I ordered them through as you can see by my verified purchase label, my batteries did not arrive in such a professional looking package. If you look at the customer pictures that were added on the product page, my batteries came in the same flimsy plastic that David Koss posted. The two pieces of plastic were then taped together with packaging tape. It honestly looked like someone had scooped up a bunch of batteries from a bin and shoved them in a package.That said, I haven't had a problem with the batteries. They have certainly given new life to all those dinky little toys that have long been relegated to the bottom of the toy bin. Since I've bought them I have become the cool mom who says yes to resurrecting the dead Hess motorcycles. I also rescued my husband from certain death when I replaced the dead batteries in his voltage tester. A couple of batteries didn't work out of the package, but I buffed them up with rough fabric as another reviewer suggested and they worked fine after that.I have no idea how long they last compared to name brand batteries, but for the price I think they are worth it. It is nice to have this size batteries on hand when I need them."

231630,1,"My mistake, I didn't look at the order close enough before I pressed ""BUY""... By the picture I just figured I'd get a variety.

184203,0,"My mother has told me since I was small, to gargle with salt water when sick. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to see this Simply Gargle Rinse product. However, I wouldn't be able to justify spending $[...] on this item, when I could just mix up some salt and water myself. The only advantage that this would have would be in convenience and portability for those on travel or at work, but it's also very easy to grab a salt packet and some water, and gargle in the bathroom.The rinse comes in small plastic 'envelopes' that have an easy twist off top- I would estimate each container to hold no more than a few oz. of liquid. I was personally hoping for a bit more in each. The color of the liquid is like that of urine- I'm not sure why though. They claim that rosemary and other herbal extracts are also added, but frankly, I couldn't tell over the extreme saltiness of the solution.I did have a bit of a sore throat due to a contagion going around the office this week, and after taking the salt water gargle, my throat did feel better the next day. However, there could be other confounding factors, such as the fact that I had a nice long sleep that evening, so I'm not certain of the efficacy of the product. Placebo effect possibly, who knows?In conclusion, I wouldn't really recommend spending $[...] on this when you can get the same for pennies out of your sink and salt dispenser."
363503,0,Gave this a 3 star because I have found this product to be good for maintaining sugar but not a radical as prescribed medicines with hard side-effects. With exercise & healthy meals it works best BUT going off the reservation and I was facing high sugar levels. I traveled alot so I went off the reservation with bad fast foods!It maintains what you choose to work at if you are NOT willing to work that then I would find it not working for me..simple as that.

112327,0,"Bought this for my wife and so I asked her how she liked it. She likes it better than the one she had from LLBean; says it blocks more light and is more comfortable but it does make her face sweat around the eyes.From my perspective, I know it gives her a better nights sleep as she is very sensitive to light. She doesn't wake up as much and that's good for both of us."

Since then I have only been using Melatonin, but I wake up often due to pain. Since I started using the Calms Forte I have been staying asleep longer and I feel more rested in the morning. Keep in mind I am using it with Melatonin, maybe that is why it is working better for me."

307400,0,"I love this particular vitamim C product. And I use the capsules. Even though vegitabs appears in the large link, each quantity is either blank or states 'caps' and apparently what I ordered were horse-pill sized tablets. The listing only mentions 'caps' quantities with the assumption, on their part, that the unlabeled quantities are tablets. kind of confusing. I asked to return the product same day that I received it but Amazon wanted me to pay return postage (I ordered this product with Amazon prime). Ultimately the customer service person agreed with me re: ad being unclear and didn't charge me but it wasn't easy to convince her. Generally Amazon product descriptions are very clear and this one is an exception. The product ad is not intentionally misleading but it isn't completely clear either. How much trouble is it to label quantities as 'tabs' or 't' if you list 'caps'? Rather than reorder I bought the caps from a local health food store, paid a few dollars more and supported tne local economy so all worked out. But a bit of an eye-opening experience."
253111,1,I recently purchased the tub side seat and would recommend it to others. I like the vented storage for tub toys and it is great to sit on while giving my son a bath. In the future we will use it as a step for hand washing and potty training. My only criticism is that the texture might be too smooth. It might be slippery for little stocking feet if used as a step.

75272,0,"Hmmm, reviews were great. Was just OK, nothing special taste-wise. (perhaps the benefits?). For the money, texture & taste I highly prefer NUTS to be a top ingredient, & texture in a product called Nutz over Chocolate. Taste more like Rice Krispy bar, the kind made w/Karo Syrup, & a bit of chocolate. Also found this non-filling, or satisfying. IF you like that taste n' texture then you may like these. Back to my FAV standby that is filling & satisfying, a Sea Salt, Nuts & Choc Kind bar. If I eat one - stavs off the hunger. Where are the nuts in this? Ground up? If they were, would think it should be more filling, satisying. For me, my little 100 Calorie bag of Diamond Almonds Dark-choc are more satisfying & filling than this bar. Sorry - sounded good in theory & again IF you like the old RK bars made with Karo Syrup, then most likely you would enjoy these. Still they had a ho-hum flavor, needs the peanut butter layer added in order to taste just like them & at least wake up your taste-buds."
237894,0,"While these balls are decorative and have a good weight, I was dissapointed in the overall product. The glaze has burs and tiny rough patches that interfere with the soothing qualities the balls are intended to have. Also, the chimes sound rather dull, muffled, and occasionaly clank. I had expected the tones to be clear and have a slight degree of ressonance. The box is somewhat decorative, but of poor workmanship. If you are fortunate enough to live in Honolulu, go down to the Aloha market and pick up a better pair for cheaper from a vendor, if not, try a different brand. I ordered this brand because it was fulfilled by Amazon and could be shipped with the rest of the order. The Chinese Healthy Balls #40555 look nice on the mantlepieace, but lack functionality."

The one minor issue I have is with the pump, the rings are hard to get off and suction is easily lost in the process, maybe I should just cut off the little lip at the bottom of ring fitment sheath. It is particularly difficult to do on your own, so probably better as a toy for two."
325783,0,"I had high hopes for this product after years of gagging and sputtering on pills. Unfortunately, this did not work for me. If people who have trouble swallowing pills can be sorted into camps, I'm in the group who fears choking and always seems to catch the pill on the back of my tongue at the last second...water goes down and the pill stays in the back of my mouth. This did not do anything for my problem. I'm giving it 3 stars because I don't think there was anything wrong with the construction or design of the cup. It simply did not work for me.

It holds heat well (in my opinion), and it's comfortable and long enough. I can squish the bulge back out, but it's a little annoying, especially since I can't think of any reason why it should have a seam busting at this point."

290405,0,"I ordered straws because I already had stuff that I was going to order and this way I didn't have to remember to pick them up at the store. We have a 3 year old and depending upon the time and place a straw is a lot better than trying to use a glass. Friends who only have big or heavy glasses comes to mind. They have that little accordion thing near one end that lets them bend, which is nice if the height isn't exactly right for your toddler. The only odd thing is that they come in three colors, one of which is definitely blue, and the others which can best be described as turqoise, teal, or blue-ish. That shouldn't really matter for most people, but if you have a toddler, these straws will lead you down the path to a discussion of third-tier colors when she asks, ""What color is this?""As far as quality goes, I haven't noticed any that had wholes or cracks that messed up their suction. They do what they are supposed to do, and nothing more.I would not call them reusable. I don't know how you could possibly clean them so that you would feel comfortable reusing them. They seem more disposable to me."

If you take many, many pills or your pills are large, this little unit may not accomodate them. The compartments are very small."
326215,0,"I ordered this shaver based on the numerous reviews that stated that this thing was just as good as a full sized and full priced electric shaver.It is not. It does not have the power to hack through a couple days of growth without having to make numerous passes. I bought this because I thought I would be able to use it when I don't have time to shave the old fashioned way. Unfortunately, because it takes so many passes, it doesn't really save time at all.I would buy this thing 100 times if I was simply looking for a shaver to get me by while traveling. However, I would not buy it again to hack off three days worth of growth in a couple minutes."
297355,0,"I purchased Thermoskin because it was thinner and less bulky under clothing than the Mueller brace I had, which I had just bought off the shelf at Walgreens for half the price of this Thermoskin. It seems to give a little less support than the Mueller but was pretty comfortable to wear all day long. However, I've worn it for a week, 5 days at work and through 2 light gym workouts (bike to strengthen knee) and the stitching on the velcro that hold the brace together is half off of one pad and coming off of the other. This does not bode well for longevity. I will have to get the sewing machine out and fix it, but for the price I'm not pleased. The Mueller may be a better daily brace. I've worn the one I have for about 5 months and it is just fine."

323936,0,"I bought one of these at Walmart and I think it lasted about 8 months, about two of those involving tapping it with the hairbrush to clean the corrosion off the terminals because it was getting wet inside.I have used rechargeable Sonicare units before, and most would last 1-2 years before the batteries would start to give out. At $20, I feel this model is cheap enough to buy one a year, though I really hate the concept of it being disposable from a waste standpoint (I don't think it can be recycled). And I was using alkaline batteries because it would have ruined by nice rechargeable ones which makes it even more environmentally unfriendly. But I get such a good clean with the Sonicare that I don't want to go back to a manual toothbrush.I'm about to order another one, and I'm going to try sealing the joints inside the handle this time to see if I can keep water out. I don't feel the water was intruding into mine from the bottom so much as it was coming in from the top. Storing the handle upside down seemed to help, but it didn't fix the problem. I'm hoping that if I seal the spots where water can intrude from the top, it will keep it going longer this time."

Although the cleaning might seem convenient, I found it to be more annoying than useful and went back to the brush &amp; wastebasket method. And, the shaver and cleaner were much noisier than I would like. I had previously owned Norelco shavers that never shaved close .. but were gentle on my very sensitive throat area. The Braun shavers DO shave closer but aren't quite as gentle as I require and I still come away with nicks on a fairly regular basis.

If you still have a working model, stick with it & save your money. My only complaint with my old model was a slight leak between the tip and the hose. The water compartment of the new unit does not have the same capacity (smaller!) and while it seemed neat at first to have the tips stored under the lid, I now worry about it being a breeding ground for germs and mold. At least with the old unit the tips stood outside and the water drained away."

Symptoms include: severe nausea and vomiting, acid reflux, bloating and gas, which resulted in my sleeping on the bathroom floor the last few days, as well as inability to stand.

At first I thought it was the sides of the shaver doing it but seems like it's likely to happen anywhere on the foil. I think maybe it's because my underarm is very soft, but not smooth even though I try to flatten/taut the area with my finger. Well after this happens, my underarm turns red and is irritated and feels like it's been cut, though there is no bleeding. Ugh... I feel that this almost has no benefit over a regular razor (a regular razor has never left my underarm feeling like this before!), as you still have to go over the area multiple times, and in many directions sometimes. I can't even use it everyday because my underarm doesn't recover from the day before. A positive is that this works in the shower. Anyway, I've thrown this out now."

It helped a friend's dad who had knee trouble, also for him, didn't stay hot long enough, but it was helpful.I now use it in the winter to keep my feet warm when I first go to bed. I no longer use the electric heating blanket (which never really got my FEET warm enough). Everyone else in my house likes it cold, so I really suffer from not even being able to sleep sometimes, I feel so cold (but I hate socks on my feet!).

187202,0,"I'd describe this shaver as very middle of the road. The better Braun shavers give a much closer shave. What is great about this one is the cleaning. Just run it under hot water and it's as clean as when you took it our of the box. If I had to do it again, I'd spend a bit more and get the next model up. By the way..allow plenty of time to open the package."
56967,2,"Right out of the box, the product does not work. I took a chance on this lighter and I am sorry I did. Its nice that sparks come out when I hit the ignition but no fire. It means either this product was shipped broken or came with no fuel to begin with. Either way, this is not how a lighter should be shipped to a customer. I did not bother to ship it back as my time is worth money and for me to pay for shipping for a $12 lighter is not worth it. Besides how it looks, this lighter does deliver what it promises. At least the lighter should come filled with fuel or not broken. Don't fall for the slick looks. I am bit suspicious that maybe all the past rave reviews are posted by the employees of the seller."
29415,0,"I had a problem with my blood pressure and needed something portable and easy to use. While this item fits the bill, the BP readings are not reliable just like the Dr. told me. I hate the arm cuff machines but they are much more reliable. This one has all of the bells and whistles but I wish they could make them have more reliable readings. My BP readings with this items were 30+ points off each time that I compared them with the readings from the Doctor's office."
201464,0,"Perfect for those with space and/or storage challenges. It's small size means it stores easily, either hung on the wall or sitting in the corner. The dust pan, when folded open, has good balance, standing upright without having to brace it or continually hold on to it while sweeping. It holds a lot of swept up debris, and the brush seems to be able to get into tight spots, and picks-up well. It is well made and doesn't feel flimsy.With that said, it is really, really short. At only 5' tall and wearing socks (no shoes with heals), this broom is still too short for me. It actually hurts my back as I have to either lean over or otherwise bend my knees a bit in order to sweep with this broom. For small messes, or small areas to be swept, I can see how this would be tolerable, but I would not recommend it for whole house sweeping, not even a large room. As it is I purchased it for the porch, not a huge space and not needing swept that often, so it's fine."
91281,0,"Nice material, seems well built it's not uncomfortable to wear however it does immobilizes your wrist to a degree that using a mouse or keyboard becomes really hard and that was the reason I bought it in the first place. I wanted the black one but didn't see how to change the color and got the beige one anyhow I do use it after extended periods of computer usage to rest my wrist and carpal tunnel but I'm unable to perform fluid mouse movements and when I type sometimes I can hit others keys with the glove."

1542,0,"It seemed to be working (it was turning the wart white) but it made it painful to walk on after a few days. I had to stop using it on him at this point because he had such a hard time with it. It could be the location of the wart, but he walks fine with other treatments we've tried. I can't mark it 1 star because it did turn it white (which went back to 'normal' within a day of not using this) but not 5 since it was so painful for him. Thought I'd mention our experience in case you have a kiddo to put it on."

298348,0,"I purchased Thermoskin because it was thinner and less bulky under clothing than the Mueller brace I had, which I had just bought off the shelf at Walgreens for half the price of this Thermoskin. It seems to give a little less support than the Mueller but was pretty comfortable to wear all day long. However, I've worn it for a week, 5 days at work and through 2 light gym workouts (bike to strengthen knee) and the stitching on the velcro that hold the brace together is half off of one pad and coming off of the other. This does not bode well for longevity. I will have to get the sewing machine out and fix it, but for the price I'm not pleased. The Mueller may be a better daily brace. I've worn the one I have for about 5 months and it is just fine."
275217,1,"I purchased the Philips Norelco 7140 about a year ago. I LOVE IT!!! I tend to not shave on my days off, but the 7140 still does a great job even with 3 days of growth. The only drawback with this model; even though a charge will last for about 3wks you never know when the battery will run out. I have had NO other issues with this model and highly recommend it."

62410,0,"I originally bought the ""fragrance-free"" version of this hand sanitizer, and LOVED it, except for the sliminess (which I mentioned in my review). Well, it wasn't long after I sent in the review that I grew accustomed to the ""sliminess"" - I simply used a smaller blob, and allowed it to dry thoroughly, then sometimes used a second blob if I thought my hands were really germy, and there was no soap and water available. I originally bought it in the late fall of 2011 and used it all through the winter, and it definitely dried out my hands much, much less than other alcohol-based sanitizers. Then Amazon no longer offered the fragrance-free version with free shipping, so I looked at the ingredients of this version, and thought, ""How bad can aloe and vitamin E be?"" Well, I don't think it's the aloe or vitamin E that gives this stuff the AWFUL ""cheap perfume"" odor - it must be the grapefruit/orange/lime seed oil complex! I also tried the kids' version, and that has the same ingredients and the same disgusting smell. Like other people who are subject to migraines, I am very sensitive to smells (plus my skin is sensitive anyhow), and this Hand Sanz product just will not work for me. My husband has sensitive skin too, but doesn't care about odors much one way or another - but he also found this scent to be like ""cheap perfume."" I'm thinking maybe I can use this stuff for cleaning, since it does have plenty of alcohol - but I wouldn't use it for cleaning something like a telephone handset, where we would be smelling the icky perfumy odor all the time. When I saw that Amazon has the orginal fragrance-free stuff available for free shipping again, I immediately ordered two, which should get me through the winter (my husband won't use the fragrance free version either - says he can't get used to the sliminess). Trying to decide what the heck to rate this; the company seems good; their products DO NOT dry out the skin, but the odor is such that *I would never buy this again, and would never recommend it to a friend..."
188621,1,"My son had eczema since infancy which was terrible because he would itch everywhere, especially his face, arms & back of the knees. We live in a hot climate but still had to always put him in long sleeves & pants when he went to sleep or else he would scratch his skin until it was raw. I didn't want to start him on any steroid creams because he was so young and the aveeno lotions only seemed to work for 30 minutes. I'm so glad that my mom introduced me to the usanimals vitamins because my son's skin has never been better. I never see him scratch anymore. Plus I've noticed that among the other toddlers in his daycare (he's 2 years old now) he is the only one that doesn't get sick even when all the other kids are!"
252114,0,"It seems like this product is very good for many things, judging on the good reviews, but unfortunately, not good for what I needed it for! I made a backless-bra prototype for exercise, very light, made of cotton, and I needed to find some adhesive to keep it on. Unfortunately, this was no good. I needed an adhesive that would stay even through exercise. Today I went to test it out, applied a liberal amount to my skin, put on my bra-thing and waited for it to dry, and it seemed promising at first. It stayed well for a good long time. But about 80% into my run (I was testing it under my shirt), it started sliding all about! Because this product is removed with water, sweat ruins it even when it's very well adhered. My run lasts about 30 minutes and is about 2.7 miles, and the adhesive was toast! So I don't think I can trust it with sweat. I don't sweat excessively, just a bit, so I think that statement would be true for most people.I'm kind of bummed by that, but I think I will find use putting this on my thigh highs and such.It is true as other reviews say, the ball applicator does not roll well at all. But it works well enough that it's easy to apply.So it may not be good to use for dancing if you dance vigorously like I do, or exercise related things. But if it's for day to day use, it seems like it would work quite well.I also found the feeling of it slightly unpleasant, it feels sticky endlessly, doesn't dry so to speak, at least as far as I could tell. But maybe that's just me.So if you're not getting especially sweaty, or drenched in rain, or living in really humid weather, this product might work for you."
168203,0,"I have ordered protein bars from this company many times before and this is the first time I had any trouble. I typically order between 4 and 5 boxes every few months. This time, I got a shipment of 4 boxes and they were dated with only 1 month expiration. I did not realize this until I opened one and tasted it and it was terrible! I contacted AllStar Health and they courteously offered to replace them once I sent them back with a prepaid shipping label. I was satisfied with this but to my amaze they sent me the exact same boxes back again! I was out of protein bars at this point despite giving myself almost a month in advance to order them. They once again sent me new bars. I asked for some compensation and all I got was free shipping on my next order ($5.95 value on a $100 order...).I have used other vendors in the past as well with no problems...I will think twice about ordering from this place. I like to think this was a fluke - but be ware!"

104247,0,"This is a great thermometer besides the beeping every 4 seconds. It's probably as loud as a watch beeping but when you're trying to sleep (my husband) it is annoying. It's also annoying for me when I am half asleep and have to hear it over and over. I do cover the hole with my thumb, but that feels awkward and the beeping is still audible. If you don't think you'll mind the beeping, this is an awesome thermometer. I love it otherwise."
361630,0,"The Balance chocolate brownie bar with almonds was not the best tasting product out there on the market today. It was heavy and somewhat filling, but very thick, dense, and tasted bland. It really left something to be desired. It was chewy like a brownie and it sort of resembled a brownie, but upon biting into the bar, you just know it's not a brownie. After the first bite, it was kind of hard to eat. It reminded me of these terrible diet cookies that tasted as though they were filled with sawdust. It really needs more taste. Overall, I rated the brownie bar as three stars because I suppose that taste versus nutrition is a tradeoff."

The front comes up past her navel.)Because of the fit, lots of leaks--straight out the sides.Takes FOREVER to dry--in the dryer, over an hour & still damp in the center. 80deg sunny day outside longer than a bath towel on the line.

293339,0,"The Jarrow website lists the contents of these capsules as: 200 mg Acetyl-L-Carnitine, 170 mg Arginine, 100 mg Alpha Lipoic Acid. Most people will take this formula because they want/need Acetyl-L-Carnitine, which is a pretty expensive supplement; then, they also learned of the need for Alpha Lipoic Acid to mediate the increased oxidative byproducts when ALCA is actually working well. Arginine is a virtually free ingredient, available in abundance in amino formulas. The important thing is there is 20g of ALC in this bottle, which at the current Amazon price comes to $1.10/gTheJarrow Formulas Acetyl L-Carnitine 500mg, 120 Capsulesbottle contains 60g of ALCA, which at the current amazon price comes to $0.36/g. I've only included the Jarrow brand here to be brand neutral.There are three concerns here with this product:1. Sigma-tau HealthScience Inc. states that Acetyl-L-Carnitine Arginate Dihydrochloride is 45.1% as Acetyl-L-Carnitine inner salt, 38.7% as Arginine, and 16.2% as Hydrochloric Acid. 500mg of Acetyl-L-Carnitine is better than 500mg of L-Carnitine, according to research and as reflected in product prices. However there is nothing to show so far that 500mg of Acetyl-L-Carnitine Arginate Dihydrochloride, with only 45% actual ALCA, is anywhere near comparable to 500mg of ALCA.2. A popular baseline, included in several different authors' protocols, is 2,000mg ALCA + 600mg ALA per day. This usually means 4x 500mg ALCA + 2x 300mg ALA capsules/tablets per day. To get 2g of ALCA you will need to take 10 of these capsules per day, bringing with it an additional 400mg of ALA you might not want or need.3. I need to do more research to see if the addition of Arginine at the molecular level somehow REDUCES the milligrams of ALCA needed, by some synergistic absorption property. Since the ArginoCarn and AminoCarnitines (both dot com) manufacturer and Jarrow websites do not have research demonstrating this, I'm suspicious about this formulation.This review will probably be updated in a week when I've had time to investigate further.Current conclusion: if you add together the cost of current ALCA + ALA and L-Arginine offerings, this product should be about 50% less than its current price."

We used ours for about a month before it started making an annoying clanking noise. The only way I can stop this noise is by turning the unit on its side or placing a towel under it so it is at an angle. When I have it on its side it is very slow to start up and sometimes will only work in the faster mode. I am sure it is not designed to work on its side but the clanking noise is horrible.

I place the shower bucket outside the tub, which falls because the bottom is made to fit in the tub.BOTTOM LINEGO FOR A DIFFERENT BATHING METHOD!"
237862,0,The product is in good condition and work as expected. The case and balls inside were very dusty and dirty though. A quick rinse and dusting made them better but these must have been in the warehouse for ages.

244801,0,"Just got it few days ago. The blade can fit in my Braun 7526, but the cutter block won't fit. So, if you want to buy this to replace yours, maybe you are going to have another useless cutter block. It's not worth it."
86573,0,"I bought these for my left-handed, 6yo son who was having trouble holding a pencil. They've been great for him. However, I thought the price plus shipping was way too much! Also, the soft, cushiony material they are made from attracts lint and dirt like crazy! I am constantly washing them off so my son can use them.So--yes, they're a help, but the dirt/lint attraction is a nuisance."
192172,0,"The mop head on this mop is really great. It attaches easily to the unit and stays attached, and it does its intended job effortlessly.However, the handle is a piece of junk. Seriously. For $30+ dollars, I expected something with a little heft. This thing is tin-can light. I could probably overlook that were it not for two other issues - the telescopic feature and the handle design. The handle on this is straight, just like the picture, and this is just not a comfortable design for a mop. My previous mop had an ergonomic handle and was by far more comfortable to use - unfortunately I didn't realize this would be a big deal or I probably would have skipped the Mystic Mop. Regarding the telescopic feature, yes it's a nice feature, but the problem is it doesn't stay locked in place when I apply a bit of pressure to the unit to loosen something that is dried/gunked on the floor, it folds back into itself, and then I have to re-adjust it. I don't have to apply pressure to the unit often, so this a minor annoyance, but it is an annoyance nonetheless.I debated between 3 and 4 stars on the Mystic Mop. The actual mop pad really is top-notch, but the handle is not up to par at this price point, so I'm going with 3 stars."

I still wanted to buy it because it seems like a great concept...she was right. The hose is useless, barely puts out any water, the button takes two hands to push (how am I supposed to make sure my newborn positioed correctly with both hands pushing a sprayer), the hose leaks. Its going back to babies r us today."
306370,0,"I bought these because I thought they would be more effective than the smaller heads.

Be sure you get NKO Krill, the quality of other sources is quite variable at this point. The name brands, such as Jarrow, Now, all use NKO Krill, which is a patented process. The only concern is how old it is. Check the expiration date."

284976,0,"I bought a package of these from my barber for about $7.50. The first blade was great -- sharper than the Personna brand (from Wal-Mart) I had tried before. But the sharp edge did not last as long, and the rest of the package was variable in quality. Some were sharp and smooth, some seemed to rip my skin more than others. Not long afterward, Wal-Mart started carrying Wilkinson blades made in Germany for less than $2.00 for ten blades, and they were at least the equal of the Merkur."
53226,2,"I have read many reviews complaining about the short battery life of the Sonicare toothbrushes. I have two of the Sonicare Advance toothbrushes. One lost all battery life within one year. The other lost all battery life within two years. I emailed Philips Sonicare and they had me call customer service to resolve the problem. I called and here is the solution that they gave me:1. Put the toothbrush on the recharge stand and hold the power button in for 5-7 seconds until you hear/feel two beeps. Release the power button. Keep the toothbrush on the recharge stand.2. Hold the power button in again until you hear/feel one beep. Release the power button.3. Keep the toothbrush on the recharge stand for 24 hrs.This process will reset and recharge the battery.Other than the battery problem they have been superb toothbrushes.Update: The above procedure did not work. Sonicare says that I need to replace the toothbrush and suggested that I buy a more expensive product. Until they solve the problems with their batteries I will not by another Sonicare product. It's a shame. Other than the battery problems they are superb toothbrushes.Based on this new information, instead of the original 5 star rating that I gave Sonicare, I now give Sonicare a 2 star rating since I do not believe that the value for the dollar spent is there."

186677,0,"This is a typical protein powder. I used this product for about a month as a breakfast meal replacement. I lost about 2lbs, so nothing major. My best friend used it as well, but replaced breakfast and lunch and lost around 5lbs in a month. We ate healthy foods and execised about 3 to 5 times a week for about 30-45 min. So no major weightloss with this product.It taste fine, mixes well, but nothing extraordinary when compared to other powders. The increase in metabolism is what drew me to this product (34 years old, one child, and need to lose about 30lbs), but I could get the same result with any other product as well.I would definitely shop around for a cheaper product and I won't be buying this product again, but of course, to each his own!"

422774,1,"This is a god send. My diabetic neurapathy, (especially in my toes and feet) used to drive me crazy. My doctor had previously prescribed various medicines that did nothing or worsened the problem. Then I found NERVEFIX on the internet. From the first time taking it, it provided instant noticable relief. Like letting the air out of a baloon that was ready to explode. After a few weeks I would say I'm 50-70% better. No intense pain and hardly any sensitive (to touch) nerves as before. It really works for me."
235729,1,"I've been using this lotion for three years and late last year, the odor went from almost unscented to a glue-like or plastic smell. I'm not sure why.

109103,0,"The Caramel Nut Blast Balance bars are not a bad protein or nutrition bar, but they are nothing special either. As far as taste goes they are mediocre being kind of basic and bland. These do have a high amount of protein, 13g (28% of daily recommended value) which is a nice amount. The bars run a little on the small side (about 1.75 oz) and kind of high for calories at 210. Overall, I feel like the bars are just OK compared to others out there, and I would not likely purchase them again. There are plenty others out there that taste better, have fewer calories, etc. even other balance bars."
82901,0,"Oops! Forgot this was under my husband's name! I am Diane. I liked the product. I have never used anything made specifically for incontinence before, but always used sanitary pads. Honestly, I can't say there is a lot of difference so I would probably base my choice between the Poise and the menstrual pads on price. They did seem a little thicker so I think that they might be a good idea for someone with a more severe problem. I have more problems when I am pregnant or sick where I sneeze or cough a lot. Fortunately for me I did not have a lot of problems during the test drive!!! I would buy them if the price was right."
224020,0,"This shampoo was recommended to me by a sales clerk at Whole Foods. I have very itchy scalp and dandruff that other non-medicated shampoos were not helping to alleviate. I wanted something natural and not full of Earth harming chemicals. I have to say that with the first application it worked fantastically. I did not itch and my hair did not come out dry or frizzy. I did end up returning the shampoo because the darned shampoo made my hair smell like truck stop beef jerky, and quite frankly I don't care for beef jerky. I thought the smell would go away once I dried my hair, but it did not. I will admit, though, that the smell wasn't quite as pungent. I'm a city girl, and I don't spend a lot of time in the woods, but the time I have spent in the woods I can honestly say that they did not smell like this horrendous shampoo. So, it works. Just watch out for the smell."

280534,0,"First, I got the wrong size, which I couldn't really tell until I had actually used it. I have good-sized hands and got a medium. When I press hard, it's too long and cuts into the base of my thumb. I also don't like the way your thumb rolls around in it -- it should be more snug at the top. Aside from that, it works well on the bottoms of feet, spinal muscles, and any place that's wide open. Not so great for intricate work."
147014,0,"This product works wonderful for migraines, but is just too heavy! I have Fibromyalgia and I found it uncomfortable and I had to return it. It was too heavy for my head and with the Fibro, trying to hold it up made my neck muscles kill!! But, I have other products that are similar and you have to store them carefully! Lay it as flat as you can and in the same way it came. I put mine in 2 ziplock bags to prevent any freezer smells and then I put that in Tupperware. Be very careful with the Velcro!! It will stick to the spandex type material and fray it. Check out all the other products, they have everything for every muscle group! This is worth the money as long as you intend on taking good care of it and have a really strong neck! Customer service for these guys is great also!"

77897,0,"Obviously, when it comes to these noise makers, the most important issue iswhat noise you are trying to drown out. In other words, what are you using the machine for? I live in a large apartment building in the New York City area. I am trying to drown out 2 different, annoying sounds in my life--pigeons, because my upstairs neighbor likes to feed them, and a crying, wailing baby across the hall. This noise machine did not do a good enough job against the cooing pigeons underneath my window. I could still hear the pigeons. It does do a good enough job drowning out the sound of the crying, wailing infant. I just put this machine near my front door. The point is that this machine, even at its loudest setting, is not that loud. The sound is very soothing and consistent, though. After a while, you don't even realize you have this noise machine on. You just feel pretty good because you've blocked out or muffled that noise that was bothering you. This machine would be good to create a calm atmosphere for a baby.Also, I've seen a few therapists in my day and some of them use thisnoise machine so nobody else can hear your conversation. I'm not sure if that works. If you want something that is louder than this machine, trythe Sound Oasis. The Sound Oasis has nature sound effects as well as white noise.Two very important points about this machine: it does NOT take batteriesand the power cord is a little over 7 feet.Please note, this is a good noise machine. It has a very nice design that seems to take up no space in any room--it's inconspicuous. It has a nice nice sound, very natural sounding. The noise it makes, a kind of rush of air, does not have that digital sound that some machines can have. this sound is calming and meditative. But even at it's highest volume, it is not that loud."
127445,0,"I used this recently on an overseas trip. I would have to say that it did block out light and was fairly comfortable. I think the comfort level would greatly depend on your face. For me, it put a little pressure on my nose and I had to wear it higher on my face than it is really made for. Having said that, I do not think it prevented me from sleeping and the earplugs that came with it were great. I will continue using it."

93005,0,I bought these because I have a pair of dress shoes that constantly rub my heels.

131147,0,"The massager received such high marks from various publications that I felt compelled to buy it. It shipped relatively quickly and I was very excited to receive it, as my back was in desperate need of some attention. Upon plugging it in and setting it up on my couch, both very easy procedures, I was surprised to come to find that the massager was much too hard on me, even with the cover pad in place. All in all, it's a fine device, but not for the faint of back, or pain tolerance."
105491,0,"I used this product a couple of years ago and it worked fine -- pretty much as predicted. Now I am getting no change at all after 10 days. Not even the normal. I do feel better, lighter, sort of. As if toxins have left. But I sure can't figure how. Bad batch? Go ahead and give it a try. Oh, the company does not answer its mail. I wanted to ask them which of their cleansing products can be taken together and about this product not working as predicted. Nothing."
61823,0,"I was so excited about this tub, it was the main thing I wanted from our registry. It isn't that great.

129245,0,"This waterer does what it says it will. It does spray out of the joint where the handle and rod are joined. I think it is a design flaw, not a shipping issue. I don't like this, but the other waterers I found of this style are $100s of dollars."
216213,0,"I used these blocks training for the Chicago Marathon. The first few times, I enjoyed the taste, but was a little put off by how big and chewy they were.The package says that each package is two servings of blocks. However, there is not a very good way to store the second half of the bag while on your run. The remaining blocks got even stickier than they started out.Also, they were somewhat hard to eat while running. They were just too big and too chewy.I have switched to the Jelly Belly Sport Beans, which I find better tasting and somewhat easier to eat due to their smaller size."

402650,1,"I bought these taurine pills to hopefully get a nice pre-workout energy boost. I'm happy to report that it has worked quite well during the past week. I definitely get a burst of energy that carries me thru my workouts & enables me to push a little bit harder, whether it be cardio or strength training.I only take it early in the day though. Just like the gingko, holy basil & ginseng that i also take (to help me stay awake & focus on my studies) I find that these energizing herbs & supplements have a tendency to keep me up late if consumed later in the day, just like caffeine does.Edit 12/28/12....Doesn't have quite the same energizing effect as before, it seems my body started to get used to it & i may have to up the dosage now. Still taking a taurine pill but also have been using Beta-cret pre-workout the past week, it seems to be giving me sufficient energy for my workouts right now.2/12/13....I thought the energizing effects had worn off, so i went without it for a few days & felt very fatigued. Once I started taking it again it feels more effective like when i first started. What i gather from this is that I may have to take a break for a few days or a week every so often whenever it seems like my body has gotten used to it again. (although since my energy level goes down considerably during this little break, I won't do it when i have exams or any other big things to tackle)"

39582,0,"A little bit goes a long way with this product. I like the rust-resistant bottom, but I learned to keep all shaving gels up on top to not leave a rust ring. I'm not really fond of the smell though. My legs are always dry after I shave them, and they still were after using this product. I liked the gel much better than foam. I didn't see any different one way or another from any of the other shaving gels that I've tried, though."
388461,0,"I have always purchased Remington's for shaving and always will. Like many others I was a huge fan of the 3700 series shaver. I've never paid $90+ for a shaver before so I had great expectations, but sadly was very disappointed. For some reason, this razor just plain ol doesn't shave like the other Remingtons. The most disappointing functions are the pop up trimmer and the pop up foil in that neither seem to actually cut.In fact, I tried the pop up trimmer on my hand just to see what the problem was and I swear it took 5+ passes to notice hair being cut. I also found that it snags in thicker hair (around mustache and goattee). So I actually just reordered the 3700 series again. Older model, but it performs like a Remington at least."
133577,0,"I find this product ok. The design is neat and easier to store than the older versions but I found the power to be just a little short of the mark. Give it a larger reservoir and some more power and I would consider this water pik perfect, or nearly perfect."

144418,0,"I was hopeful about this product given that my son has had many ear infections. I practiced first on my husband and was able to see the ear drum (although I'm not sure I would have been able to tell if it was infected or not). Sadly, I could not get this to work at all on my 2 year old. Despite the fact he sat very still (sensing I'm sure my ineptness), I was still unable to even get a glimpse of his ear drum. I'm sure the product is a good one (light was very bright as advertised), but for an average parent, this will be tricky to use. This may be a fine product in the hands of a skilled parent, but before you buy it consider your skill level."
104433,0,"Useful item, misleading description. I actually used this last weekend when I unexpectedly had to put chains on my tires and was without a hat and mittens, so I am glad I had it. However, the item description lists ""1 hand-charged dual LED flashlight"" which is not the case. I got a normal, incandescent flashlight with two batteries. No LED, no hand-charge. Also, the item description lists ""strobe light"" which also appears to be absent, unless you repeatedly turn the flashlight on and off by yourself. Finally, no matches as the description says. Apparently shipping regulations restrict the shipping of matches.These items really need to be fixed in the description."

275545,0,This is a nice shaver except for the very anemic motor.The heads are the same ones used in a number of the higher priced Norelco/Philips shavers and they are very efficient.But if you have a heavy beard and/or only shave every couple of days then you will definitely be happier with a more powerful shaver.Mine holds a charge pretty well but that is not too advantageous when it takes as long to shave as it does with the 7180.
367062,0,The shaver is just as convenient as I expected. But It doesn't handle well the several days growth of beard my husband tends to have. He is African American so his beard is curly. I bought the shaver because he broke his right arm and needed to shave with the left. This razor just didn't do it.
288313,2,"I've been shaving my own head once a week with a Wahl contour for 8 years. During that time I had 3 boys that I also cut their hair using the 1/8 and 1/4 attachment. The motor finally pooped out so I looked online and ended up with this Andis. I'm gonna make a long story short. this thing is great if your never gonna use an attachment and your only gonna use it for 5min. It is one step below horrible at cutting with attachments and it gets very very hot after about 5-10min. I'm talking 3rd degree burn hot. With my old one I could cut mine and my three boys hair all in one sitting, but with this I have to stop half way through one head just to let it cool down. This is junk and I would throw it if it was still in one piece, but it burnt my hand for the last time yesterday and I smashed this crap on my driveway."

217951,1,I suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome. I really don't know how I got this illness but I soon experience extreme exhaustion and weariness from work very often so I ended up asking the opinion of my physician. He informed me that I have active virus which eats up most of my energy so I end up tired and confused.I managed to hold on to my job thanks to the Gene Eden VIR 101 product which was given to me by my friend in the US. He himself is using it to combat latent chronic viral infection which results to lesser efficacy of the body's immune system. I am recovering fairly well after taking Gene Eden as my regular supplement but I wanted to perform the previous activities I enjoyed doing like regular gym work-outs and long walks in the park. Ever since I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome I was limited by my doctor to do strenous activities but with the aid of Gene Eden I feel long lasting boosting energy flowing through my blood stream.I tried to combine Power Bar with one of my walks in the park and I was amazed how it kept my energy level high. I believe the electrolytes contained in these energy bar is sufficient to keep the cells of my body going.I plan to do an hour of aerobic routine next week and is optimistic that both Power Bar and Gene Eden will not fail me.Thank you very much for giving me a chance to live my previous life once again. I just hope eating much of Power bar won't make me fat in any way.
97492,0,"I've used the McDavid knee strap and it works pretty well for me (loosens when sweating and the ""bump"" is starting to peel up - but it's been used a lot). I decided to try the Mueller strap instead, but I don't like it as much. Because of the thick ""trim"" of fabric all around the edge, the velcro peels up easily (and has actually ruined some of my clothing). Also, it's much more bulky than the McDavid (both because of the thick trim and the ""bump"" being inside a channel of fabric). I don't feel like it ""sets"" into place as well as a result. I'm getting another McDavid one."

207021,0,"The original review stands save one thing not known at that time. Amazon stocks old product and I found that out after going to the manufacture to say why did these handles fall off? you have an issue... first question was did you buy from amazon? They knew exactly what the problem was and it had been fixed for some time. Handle design was completely changed because after months of wear they fall off... not an issue for short term uses... so you can save the coin here on amazon but if you need cruthces long term buy latest version at Millenum Medical directly... Awesome company... will make good on anything and everything.. never an issue awesome customer support. They have redesigened these for 2013 coming out soon and the cost is going up in feb? 2013 do not know what it will be but they sent out warning emails to customers to buy now if you want to avoid the increase... supposedly fixing some issues.. I have yet to see. They do cost more that these on amazon at old prices but not a lot and shipping is not free from them... but for me ... someone on crutches permanently for daily use for 25+ years now there is no subistitute. These are the best innovation in crutches since metal ones where introduced.I am a LOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNGGGGG term crutch user over 20 years now and counting. These crutches are EXCELLENT and the cost does not reflect the quality of this product. The quality is similar to the idea we used to say they don't make them like that anymore... well Mellennial does make them with old time quality at today's average crutch cost... with this you are truly getting your money's worth. Over all Quality is VERY VERY GOOD. These crutches are sturdy... and actually have more shaft strength than the traditional aluminum crutch. I can bend those shafts much easier than I could these. IF you are a short time user... don't worry about these... get them... Truth is you are going to hate being on crutches because it is a PAIN period... but these are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than traditional crutches it is worth it... the experience on these will be FAR FAR less exhausting and less frustrating. GO FOR IT.If you are a long term user like me and you have to be careful about what you trust and need to be concerned about your ability to function in your world with these.. the detailed review below is what I wanted to know before taking the plunge with these.... but I am very glad I did.Handle... is extremely sturdy and fairly heavy. Normal crutches require padding and fussing with for me... I was concerned about the hard look of these handles... they are softer feeling than they look (its like a smooth slightly cushy bendable without changing shape rubbery feel, but not stick rubber... smooth almost like coated) and I have had no need or desire to pad them... they are perfect feeling as they are not too hard or slippery (unless wet but they wipe off and dry up easily even if you don't have a towel or something you can do it with your hand). The other thing that is REALLY NICE about that is that I can clean these and sanitize these easily... Not possible for traditional crutch handles altered or unaltered... that material is porous and sponge like... this is not and it is very very easy to keep them clean HUGE HUGE improvement.. AND A MUST FOR KIDS OR DD. My regular crutch handles would get NASTY and I would have had to spend a fortune buying new ones to keep them somewhat cleaner.The handle shape is comfortable but took me a bit of reworking my traditional hand position to get the hang of it and i had some discomfort initially... but I think that was due to me using traditional crutches for so long and so often I had to retrain my learned motor patterns for this new and better handle and hand position. after about a week I was very good with it. There are some significant differences, but they are positive. The weight baring is shifted to the ball of the saddle joint and heel of the palm on the thumb side while the back side (distal side of palm heel) no longer bares any weight. Better but took adjustment for me a long time user. First timers or irregular crutch users should not notice this.Handle attachment and adjustments. The screw is a SUPPER improvement in ease of getting on and off. Much better than traditional wing nuts that break and crumble with long use.... The screw attachment is very smooth and easily adjusted which I recommend until you find the right combination of handle distance and hight adjustments for you personally. This was greatly appreciated when I was figuring that out and needing to take them out and reposition frequently in the initial week or two of use.The only bad on the handle is that with EXTENDED (constant daily use to go anywhere) They do start to loosen up. I think that they need a secondary support on the underside. But short term users even if short term and daily will not notice this until about 2 or 3 mons. of use. Unless perhaps the person is very heavy like over 250 -300 that might make it worse sooner... just speculation... This is NOT A DEAL BREAKER though. It is an area of this product that improvement is needed but these crutches are still WAY WAY better than the traditional alternatives.Height Adjustments on Shaft are just like traditional crutches but higher quality parts on these crutches... they are extremely well made and substantial feeling without extra weight. By far the weight from these crutches resides in the heavy handle because of the design it has to be and if they cost a little more than the traditional crutch in price it is deserved, you won't feel ripped off by these. The crutches have a very cool paint on them that takes that metallic feel of uncovered aluminum shafts that feels like nails on a black board away... they feel more like a bicycle coated paint...not quite that thick and heavy though... it is a very good improvement over the uncoated metal... they are smoother, slicker feeling. They do scratch and scuff, but less noticeable, it doesn't look as tacky when these get scuffed. Also when my traditional crutches got dinged or gouged they would often leave a sharp or rough edge that could actually scrape or even cut you... these have not done that and the scuffs scratches feel smooth and more cosmetic than the deep ones I could get on the old crutches.The Arm Pads - I was skeptical about these based on the pictures... but I must admit these are far superior to the traditional pad. I have to duck tape material over the traditional crutches pads because it feels a bit better and the pads without a cover of some kind will wear and tear the hell out of my clothes with extended use over time. These crutches require NO ADDITIONAL padding or covers seriously nothing else is needed. They have been easy on my clothing and they are much more comfortable and less bulky feeling. Sometimes I am not sure they are even there. I am noting that they tend to slip away from the front end slightly... not much and you need to work them back up towards that end occasionally with a twisting and pulling motion slow but sure they flush up again. (I'm talking like a 1/4 inch at most.The one negative to the Arm pads is this... because I am only 5'4 and I felt like I needed to get the short set.... the arm portion (flat bar at top) is smaller than it would be on the large size. I like this most of the time but.... once in a while when I am not paying attention I have had one side slip out backwards on me. This is a bit dangerous as it happens most often when I am leaning forward going down stairs or something.... but I have always caught myself. Minor issue really, but you do need to be mindful of the arm position if you are an adult with the smaller size crutch.SPRINGS---- WAY WAY COOL.. do not fear this feature... embrace it fully... it is very subtle...after initial wow factor... these are NOT GOING TO CATAPULT you any where but they do ease some of the shock and push off requirements. My shoulders and maybe in the wrists even more feel less tense and I fell like I use less energy on forward propulsion. Here is the acid test. try them going up stairs. put crutches up first one stair then foot up two stairs (if you do this you know what I mean, I have learned over time how to go up stairs with crutches not feet first, this is an advanced skill). The only down to these springs i found was this... after about only one month.... the crutches started to scrap and Grind during the spring part. SCARED me at first.. thought they were defective... thought the spring was going to collapse from over use... it was an irritating feel and sound (NOT like fingernails on black board Far LESS harsh than that and not high pitched) but irritating. I thought maybe I was not being good about the angle... and I still don't know what was going on but it has now three mons later? it has all but stopped...maybe enough metal scrapped off and the groove is worn now but it doesn't do it any more. AND I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE THESE UP ... will never go back to the others NEVER. This issue could have been very serious but... it appears to have corrected itself and it has not compromised the quality or performance of the crutch in any way that I can tell. I am glad it stopped though. I would say if that were to happen call the company... but you can probably ride it out in a short time if you are long time user.Tips... Supper impressed with their durability. I went through traditional tips every couple of months that metal piece would always ware though the bottom then fall out and I would be walking on the end of the metal tip (plastic covered) and slipping all over the in door floors until I could get a new one? welllllllll these tips are three months old and they look slightly worn on the bottom.... yes slightly like about 10% off original conditions and I AM NOT EASY ON TIPS... I walk all over outside and in all the time every day. I think that spring thing helps with this. Also they are much more multi directional in their surface grip than the traditional tips which get some what hard and brittle over time with age like two - three months. These are supple still... bendy and you can put your crutch on a far lower angle to the floor and expect it to hold its place without slipping I have tried like 60 degree angle estimate and it doesn't budge from the floor spot. I also have noted less slipping in wet conditions... they do slip... but not as bad.Folding Feature - very very cool to have without in any way compromising the strength of the shaft. I was concerned that feature would cause the shaft to be less sturdy or stable than the non folding shaft. NOT SO.... It is accomplished with a button control just like the ones used for hight adjustments and the two halves are kept attached when folded by thin but strong bungy style cord in side core. EXCELLENTLY engineered. This is not a feature you will want to use every time you sit or get in and out of a car... but when you will be there for a long time or not constantly getting in and out or simply don't have the space this is the coolest thing I've seen in a long time. It is a MUST HAVE OPTION.Lastly I have also contacted the company. They are real folks and they seem to care about customer service and care... I have not contacted them about problems however so I don' know the company from that angle, but i don't doubt that if something was wrong with these they would make it right one way or another. They have a great product and i am now a lifetime Millennial Crutch user."

I only have 3 weeks left in my pregnancy, so perhaps I should have stayed with what I was using, but the Motherlove had good reviews, so I switched.The product is the same size as the other products in this category, so no issue there for the price. However, the Motherlove Belly Salve is a bit greasy for my taste. First off, the container is really small compared to my other product. This makes it hard to get to the salve if you have nails. Lastly, it's very greasy. It doesn't dry quickly, so you have to wait for at least 20 minutes before putting anything over your stomach/breasts/etc.Unfortunately, I don't know if it works yet because I just began using the product. However, from a general standpoint, it seems to be a good subsitute for the Bella B since the price on that item has increased for the same amount."

394634,0,"I was so excited about this bathtub. A shower? FANTASTIC!! It is a nice tub and works well with my newborn but I find that it is not as comforable to use as I had hoped.Mechanically everything works smoothly (so long as there are no kinks in the hose). The sling is great and it has a temp strip so you always know if the water is right. The shower works great and the baby, who doesn't care much for baths, is soothed by it. Sounds great, huh? However...I have a few complaints with the tub. The material of the shower hose is not very flexible. Because it is not flexible, the hose easily kinked and created a permanent crease, thus it re-kinks quite often. I also find that the button to control water flow is placed in a way that makes the nozzle uncomfortable to hold. The basin which holds the water for the shower sets in the end of the tub near the feet. My baby is only 1 month old and already it is crowded in that zone. There really isn't enough room within the tub to accomodate both the infant and the basin (Not a HUGE problem, just set the basin ouside of the tub... this would probably lessen the frequency of kinks... however, this is where the thermostat was placed!! Poor planning!).All in all, I am satisfied with this product and it was WELL worth the cost, just slightly more than a plain old tub. I just think there are some very simple changes that could make this tub PERFECT. Moving the thermostat to the side of the tub is simple and making the hose out of a more durable material would easily make this tub a 5 star product.Despite the mediocre rating, I WOULD reccommend this to others."
330843,0,"For $200, it really isn't a device that does much. It just gives you lights to tell you how in coherence you are.on the subject of coherence, I have tried very hard to get Heartmath's ideas of cut-thru, freeze frame, etc. to work. They never did. I never got any subjective benefits from doing them and when I used either the stresseraser or the emwave I would not get verifiable results that I was entering coherence. I found if I tried to do heartmath techniques I got the same results as I got just sitting around doing nothing or watching TV. They don't work at all for me.But I did find that deep diaphragm breathing works extremely well for entering coherence. Breath via the nose through the abdomen for a count of 4-6, then out via the mouth for 8-10. Repeat.Before I usually ended up getting red and blues on level one (there are 4 difficulty levels on the emwave and the colors signify how in coherence you are in the order of red-blue-green) with virtually no greens. But once I ignored the heart math techniques and ignored trying to sync my breathing with HRV and just focused on deep breathing I was able to get steady green lights on level 2 and 3 difficulty. I am hoping I will be able to get steady green lights on level 3, so I can try level 4. But with the heartmath techniques I was stuck on level 1.So for me this device has a few good selling points.1. It motivates me to focus on meditation (it is easier to sit through 10-15 minutes with this device than without it).2. It gave me actual verification of what I was experiencing subjectively with various meditation tools. Both this and the stresseraser (I own both) showed no benefit to heartmath techniques but a strong benefit from deep breathing. Without these biofeedback devices I never would've know what my personal physiology responds best to.But is it worth $200? Not really. Maybe $80. I got mine cheaper than $200 though.Once you learn an effective method of stress reduction you don't need a biofeedback device anymore IMO. I can do deep breathing exercises w/o this device. But if I had never used it I might never know deep breathing works for me but the heartmath techniques do not."

Shaving every day it does an adequate job, but last weekend I did not shave, so I went from Friday morning until Monday morning between shaves and it took a very long time to complete the shave. Afterwards I had some strange hairs remaining in different places on my throat. So I'd recommend a real razor after skipping a few days, then use the Braun for the daily work."

To be fair, we have not used it for heat therapy. It may be wonderful for that. But don't buy if you need cold therapy."
42578,2,I bought this product thinking it would be a decent protein. I was highly dissapointed. It has a very bad taste and unless you are using a blender (I use a blender bottle) it is very hard to get the protein to break down and not be chunky. Spend your money on gold standard or syntha 6. Just as good of proteins with a much better taste and blendabilty.

87009,0,"I love this heating pad, problem is I'm on my 4th one, I have yet to get one to last much more then 3 years and at this price I would expect a better quality product that would last longer. I have a cheap drug store brand heating pad from when I was a kid, 30 years ago (& who knows how old it was then) that Still works. Not worth the $ if you need it long term. They only have a year warranty so when it breaks you have to buy another one. This is way to expensive to be replacing every few years. I will say the large size, moist heat & digital control is great but I think this time I will be looking for these features from another maker. Bummer because it really is a very nice heating pad, WHEN IT WORKS."

As soon as I saw what I thought was 2 lines positive, I used the same urine and dip in another strip and would see a BFN. The tests were read within the specified time frame and weren't expired."
170276,0,"I was confused as to why it was priced over 15 bucks for something made so cheap. When I got it in the mail, there were actually two sets in my box. To beat all.. One set was missing the brush and the aspirator was broken. Since I was able to combine them to make a nice functional set, I just went with it and didn't bother to do a return because I didn't want the hassle. You would probably be best to just go buy a set from Wal-Mart, this one is just so cheap that I may even buy a different soon lol"

280067,0,"First let me say that this item is exactly what I need: a timer that vibrates to remind me to take medicine each hour. And since it is quiet I can wear it around my neck in movie theaters, lectures, etc. without disturbing anyone. However, it could be a little better quality. I wear it on a necklace. Soon after I got it the battery compartment came open while I was driving and spilled out a battery as I got out of the car. Luckily I retrieved the battery. This could easily happen if used as a key chain. The battery compartment is not very tightly closed. On the topic of batteries, even though this item is inexpensive, the first set of batteries lasted me only one month, and Radio Shack charges close to $11 for the pair. I hope my second set (bought this week) lasts longer. And setting the item is more confusing than most electronics. If I accidently bump a button while I'm out, the timer, alarm, and clock all go haywire, and I have to come home to read instructions to fix it. The buttons are not intuitive in any way. I'll use this timer for now. But if something better came along, I would probably switch."

18444,0,"I recently conducted a wine study where we had 40 participants drink 10 wine samples of .75oz. We calibrated the AL100 units for each participant and found that the results varied by almost .2 after drinking. Yes, that value is not a typo and yes we allowed up to 30 minutes post-drinking before testing. We even had non-drinking control participants use the device and found that most values indicated the controls were extremely intoxicated (BAC > .2) at the conclusion of a study where they consumed no alcohol. I believe there are many factors that affect the BAC values for the AL100 but none are explicitly stated in the instructions nor would any user be able to attend to them all.So if you are seeking a device to help your child avoid a DWI, I suggest you look elsewhere. If, however, you are looking for a cocktail conversation piece then this unit provides ample coverage. The wild values will get a great laugh and the cost will easily be justifiable after just one party."

66481,0,"After doing what I thought was adequate research I selected this heating pad because of its large size, wash ability, comfort, and the many timing and heat options. Granted the options and wash ability are great, but I didn't find it all that comfortable...or large. I was actually thrilled to get this as my old pad was one of those plastic pads with the fabric sleeve. The plastic gets all bunched up inside of the sleeve and has to be constantly flattened out. This new pad seemed the perfect solution; unfortunately it's hard and stiff. For me it's quite uncomfortable and the flatness of it bothers me. I use it on my lower back and neck and its inability to mold to my body causes heat on only the areas it is touching. My old plastic one, despite its problems, wraps around my neck and molds into all surfaces of my lower back. I also found the width of this one to not be long enough. I suppose what I need is something that will reach from hip to hip or shoulder to shoulder, which this does not. The height is quite ample and although it is a rectangle it is only 4 inches wider than it is tall, creating more of a square. For the lower back something 24 inches wide by 14 inches tall may be in order. Overall it works fine as far as the control features, and the cord is super long, but the flatness, stiffness and hardness makes it fairly useless for me for anything other than a foot warmer, which is a shame since it was fairly expensive after shipping. I will search for something with a longer width that is thicker and more flexible."

However, there is a piece of bendable plastic that covers the blade, and eventually that failed. I fill a 28 day pill container at one time, so it was probably the repeated use that caused this to happen. If you use for fewer pills at one time, it will probably last longer."

131266,2,"Bought one for my wife for Christmas. She used it for about 10-15 minutes. Then I tried it later that day for about 10 minutes. Worked great. A few days later we tried it again, and nothing. It wouldn't even power up. AVOID!!!!"
316948,1,This is a great wipes warmer. I only used it though until my son was a few weeks old. Then I stopped using it because the cold wipes didn't bother him anymore. It is worth the money though and regardless of what other people say the wipes do not dry out or turn brown. My wipes were always very moist. I got my use out of it and I will more than likely use it again for my next baby.

These last, even when the camera starts to indicate low power, if you turn the camera off for a bit, the batteries come back showing full power. Eneloops hold their charge for longer than ordinary rechargeables. I've had the original set for 5 years before one of the batteries went bad. I recommend these highly, they seem to be more consistent than other brands."

18205,0,"The Masks are fine and are a little sturdier built than the typical retail store ones but with the added price. They block light well and are great for back sleepers. Since they are bulkier, I find side sleeping pushes the mask into my face.This part is update after much use of the product: These do fall apart fairly quickly. They are sturdier build in some ways, like in the elastic but the mask is glued together in layers and the material layers come apart too quickly. Think of the liner inside a car that falls down. I bought 2... If you use any moisture at all to wipe away a grime, it is worse. I still give it 3 stars because it does indeed block light well, but for the cost, I thought they'd last longer than they did. I switched to a knock off after these that last just as long for half the cost."

18073,0,"I got this in ""mums"" and black (for me and my husband). My husband has taken a liking to it and I see him use it pretty much every night. I use it occasionally... the mums print is so cute!!! But I like it primarily for the unique print and SOMEWHAT ergonomic, contoured shape. The shape looked great in photo, but it doesn't lay flat on the sides of my nose... the inverted ""V"" shape part is a tad too wide/big for me. Perhaps if you had a bigger nose or the entire nose area were sticking out more, this would fit perfectly. I almost wish that they just cut a slit for the nose instead of a ""V"", so the flaps will lay over the sides of the nose.. I would imagine that will fit more people's facial shape and will keep lights out more effectively. I wonder if I should've tried the ""Lights out"" one also available on Amazon... but they just weren't as stylish : P"
291117,0,"I've been taking TwinLab Ripped Fuel Metabolic Accelerator for about ten days now, and I'm hoping to make my review somewhat of a periodic assessment that I will augment every so often.To begin, it's difficult to determine the benefits so far. With less caffeine than a cup of coffee, it's awfully hard to determine if the boost of energy one gets is from the Ripped Fuel or... well... from the cup of coffee you just had. So I'll start by saying that the pill is easy to swallow -- it doesn't quite classify as a ""horse pill,"" though it is big. I hate swallowing pills, but I truly don't have a hard time with this one.I have noticed a little bit more of a tendency to ""crash"" a little bit in the afternoon, which is something I will continue to monitor as I continue to use this product. So please be patient, and I'd appreciate any comments you might have that would help me measure the progress with this supplement.---------------------------------------------------------------I've realized that it is quite difficult to periodically review anything! :^) I can tell you that I haven't really been able to judge this product based on the time that has passed since I received it. The only thing I've really noticed -- and I've had to look closely -- is that my hands seem to shake a little a while after taking it. This could be anything, however... I do drink coffee as well.Perhaps the bottom line is this: I don't lift weights anymore. I am an office guy. My wife and I have our first kid on the way, and our workouts are based on doing laundry, cleaning the house, and trying to get everything in order for the arrival of the baby. The most helpful I can be is to tell you that for many of us, this product is like buying an article of clothing that we're never going to wear. So if you're like me... this might be the best product of all time, but it's not for us. If you're someone who buys the stationary bike and actually uses it... or the home gym, or the gym membership, then Ripped Fuel might be for you. But don't get it if you're not committed."

417510,0,"Littmann stethoscopes are known for their quality, durability...and price. I received a Cardiology II as a gift upon entering Medical school and absolutely loved it. Well, it finally broke and I decided to purchase the Cardiology III as a replacement. While the sound quality was not awful (though not as good as my Cardiology II), the tunable feature was annoying as I was used to my traditional bell. Tunable stethoscopes feature the diaphragm and bell on one chestpiece instead of two, and the pressure applied must be adjusted for high and low frequency sounds. Yet, this design does not work well on curved surfaces.I do not know why Littmann is moving away from traditional stethoscopes, but I wish they had not discontinued some of their older models. Instead, I have been using a GRx CD-27 for the past few months and could not be happier with it. It offers superior ausculatation, durability and at about one-fourth the price. I have recommended it to all my colleagues and especially my students. It offers better performance to the Cardiology III without the guesswork that comes with tunable stethoscopes."
176413,1,"I'm not sure where to begin with this stuff. First, it's not just a substitute for coffee/energy drinks, it's much more effective. One minute I'll feel like death, 20 seconds after chewing a piece of this I'll be perfectly fine. I believe it is this effective because a portion of the caffeine is absorbed directly through the mouth and, well, ends up where it counts. This has the added benefit of not affecting your bowels as caffeinated beverages do and the effectiveness is less dependent on weight. Naturally it is also cheaper and much more convenient than a drink which is huge for me. I use this for school mostly so having a pack on me for whenever I need a price is invaluable. Bottom line, it works.And now the more subjective portion of the review, the taste. Personally I don't think it gets any better than this. I dislike mint and I'm not particularly fond of sugar-free gum so this is actually one of the few gums that conforms to my taste. Yes, caffeine is bitter, but with this I've actually managed to acquire a taste for it and I have to try not to chew this stuff casually. (Think alcohol, and I've only been through a few packs)"

338574,1,"The bottom line is that this charger charges...so let me be honest and upfront about that! But this charger does so without any specificity to 'detail' the charge or condition cycle the batteries. Being a photographer and an RC enthusiast, I burn up on AAs pretty fast. However, you NEED to know if your battery is failing charge cycle competency along with the knowledge of substituting your charge cycle with lower values to actually 'recondition' them. The MaHa Powerex fails in detail re-charging on specifically choosing lower mAh. You are forced to charge at ridiculously HIGH current levels of only 500 or 1000mAh! To be fair, this is a 'charger' per the company, but today's electronics and qualities of batteries in general do not all discharge or charge evenly thus needing to recondition them through time - and usually very slowly multiple times to recondition them. That specifically is where this charger could be better. It'll charge but to know where your batteries' mAh levels are; to itemize your charge values and to independently condition to detail is NOT what this charger accomplishes. If the premise is to simply have a quality 'charger', then that's mainly what this charger does minus one simple recharge condition value. REMEMBER: This charger only Charges at 500/1000mAh...! Not something I recommend unless you want a shorter life span from your batteries.Update on 30 April 2012.This charger has done well, despite its misgivings... It 'IS' a solid product, just not what I expected. The unit never gets hot, but will warm up your batteries. I can say, oddly, that when the batteries are done, (speaking on the crappy Energizers brand here...) they actually performed better than when I got them ~ three years ago. I recondition batteries I purchased from 2009! ~ and they are better now than when I procured them. So with that saying, I'm confident with this products ability and will say that you should be pleasantly surprised by this unit's capability. Just understand that you are NOT able to adjust the variances nor 'test' a battery as other manufactured products do. This product basically does two things in its recondition process; that for which it does, it accomplishes as advertised and produces quality recharged batteries in the end.Cheers!"
336481,0,"I've tried all the sizes available for these SleepRight night guards and it really came down to the bite pads being too thick. Don't get me wrong, the design and materials used seem of high quality, but even after a month - I was not used to this product in all the different sizes. I would wake up with cuts in my mouth (the bite pads have a harder plastic pivot) and a sore jaw from keeping it open at a certain angle (unanimous with all sizes). I think the design can use a little more refinement and it may be very good one day. I switched over to the Dentek ""copies"" and they actually work better for me. They come in packs of 2 for the price of 1 of these as well (just make sure you get the ones that have the blue bite pads). You can give it a try and may have success with this one.. but not for me.Update 3/5/2011I had to use my old pair as backup because my current night guard needed replacing. I've found these to actually be more comfortable if you adjust the bite pads to the narrowest setting holes. Perhaps this is partly due to how your jaw pivots towards the back. Wedging these bite pads into your molars forces your mouth to be opened more. Having them closer to the front allowed my mouth to be more closed during the night. With this adjustment, I'd give the product 3.5 stars if it were possible. I'd easily give it closer to 4 or 4.5 if the bite pads were more comfortable. Just thought I'd share this update."

This fact has changed my life and my body is slowly healing from the effects of the antibiotics.I want everyone who has or is suffering from chronic uti's, and the horrible side effects of antibiotics, to know about d-mannose.

308460,1,Most mouthwashes make me nauseous and so I ususally avoid them. I decided to give this one a try because of the whitening aspect.To my suprise it was quite pleasant tasting (as moutwashes go) and had a gentle tingling sensation. Be careful not to put too much in your mouth because it foams quite a bit and can become too much to swish around in your mouth. The whitening really does work. My teeth are very bright and my gums are just as healthy as ever.I definitely recommend this to anyone who hates mouthwash. You may be pleasantly suprised.

I also make homemade versions...recipes are all over the blogosphere, and they are just as good albeit more work and not as conveniently packaged. If you have the time/patience, I recommend saving yourself the money and making them yourself.I am reviewing the carrot cake flavor in this post and the flavor is very good. It's mildly sweet--the pineapple is among the most pronounced--and I enjoy the flavor. The only thing I don't like is the texture. I don't mind the contrast between hard nut pieces and soft chewy dates as I'm quite used to that from other bar recipes. However this flavor has something in it that is very small and hard (carrot shreds perhaps, or small extremely dry shavings of pineapple?) and not only do they not chew up like the rest but they get stuck in your teeth. If those little bits were not there, this would be 5 stars for me."

I think some kind of velcro or thicker strap may be necessary if you wrap it around your abdomen to prevent it from slipping. Works well enough for shoulders and neck though. Stays nice and warm for about 2 hours, but only lasts 3 times in the microwave before you need to let it rest. I have not tried it cold. Next time I might go for the disposable hot/cold patches. But if you use compress wraps a LOT, then this is the way to go. Alternatively, you can use an old pillowcase filled with beans and microwave it. It works in a pinch."
351185,0,"I have recurrent sinus issues, with frequent congestion, that turns severe once a month or so. I heard about the neti pot, and from the reviews, figured it would be life changing. I was disappointed - as soon as my nose got clogged, it pretty much stopped doing anything. Reviews recommended the Sinus Rinse instead of in case of congestion, so I gave it a shot. Well, I was disappointed too.I have to me say that this product is incredibly useful when you have to blow your nose, but can't get everything out. It's frankly the best use I've found for it... it clears your nose really well, as long as you're not too congested. The problem is that it asks you to squeeze gently, but it's pretty much impossible to get all the water out when you squeeze gently - also, the last half of the liquid is much harder to get out, and I often have to stop and squeeze the bottle several times until I get everything out. To sum up, the design could use some work.The main issue for me is that it hasn't done anything to stop/lessen my frequent sinus issues. I still have issues at night and in the morning even after using it every evening, and when I'm really congested, it really doesn't do much of anything... I can get some stuff out, but I'm just as congested as ever when I'm finished. So it's definitely not the miracle solution that I was hoping for. I have to add as well, that you end up having to squeeze harder to actually get water in your nose, and that, as other people noticed, you end up with a lot of liquid in your ears most of the time.To sum up, it's a good product if you suffer from light congestion, but if you suffer from severe congestion and hope that it will help you, you're most likely going to be disappointed."

353698,0,"This tea is just ok. Not offensive, but it doesn't really have much taste. I was really surprised when I first drank it. I think the best way I can describe the taste is starchy. Like if you cooked white rice in water for a while but then dumped out the rice and just drank the water. Not much of a ""taste"" but just kind of a starchy flavor. I guess this herb is supposed to help clean your liver but who can really say how much benefit it's having? I don't have any specific liver problems, but I just like to try a variety of different herbal formulations to get the benefits of items that don't get consumed in the normal daily diet. I drink herbal tea for health but also as a tasty beverage. I probably won't get this one again, I'll probably move on to some other herb next. There are a million out there and it's nice to mix them up and expose yourself to a variety of different ones to help your overall health.

It has resolved my lack of sleep. I have been comfortable. This machine has reasonable price and good functions.I chose this product in some similar products. Because the price of this product is the lowest in similar products. And it outputs sounds with electric device, not with electric fan.Surprisingly, there are very few similar products in Japan. So, I had to purchase at the Amazon.com in the USA. I purchased this product for $16.13. And I paid $11.08 for a shipping fee and a handling fee. That is, I paid $27.21 in all. But, it is lower than prices of similar products in Japan. Those are about $80.The electric standard differs between Japan and the USA. Japanese standard is 100V, and the USA is 125V.

334749,0,"What's in this stuff that makes it so expensive? Most likely, I'm guessing, a substance that costs a tiny fraction of what it costs you to get it. However... unlike every other useless cold sore remedy I've tried (and I've tried most of them), this product is more than just a moisutirizer or a pain reliever. At the very first sign of a cold sore, I applied this product. I suspect nothing will completely stop a cold sore once it has started, but this stuff came close. I have to admit I was surprised. Is it worth over $12 per dose to significantly reduce the typical painful and unsightly 7-10 day cycle of a cold sore? Probably. The severity of mine was reduced by, I'd say, 80-90%, and it was completely gone in about 3 days.About the expiration date fiasco also noted by another reviewer... yes it's disturbing that there is a label attached to the product extending the original expiration date. Even this new date is annoyingly close to the date of purchase however... this stuff apparently has a very short (and yet to be determined?) shelf life."

After the third day of using this, all the scaliness and redness came back, exactly like what happens when I stop using the psoriasin for three days.I'm giving this two stars because it does not work for me. I can't say ""it's okay"" which is the definition of a three star review, because it is not okay in terms of actually improving my psoriasis. It makes no difference.

Unlike some reviewers, I had no trouble with the very supportive velcro closures, even though my hands are often very numb. My guess would be that, as a support for typing on a keyboard, this product would work better for men than for women: the fabric is very sturdy and unforgiving on small or weakened wrists. My biggest disapointment though, is that, like many people with carpal tunnel or similar issues, unconsciously making fists and turning in of the wrists during sleep needs to be prevented. For this purpose, I give these braces a big fat zero. The palm support is so unyielding and stiff that I actually woke up during the night feeling as though the centers of the palms of my hands had been jabbed with a blunt stick. Very painful. But, as I said, on bigger stronger hands these would probably be fine."
58319,0,"This review is based on my usage of the charger after about a year of use. I use it to charge EnergyOn Ni-MH low-discharge AA batteries (of which I recommend) to power a wireless microphone. Sometimes the batteries are needed for a few days in a row; other times they aren't needed for weeks at a time.The other positive reviews about this charger covers its assets well, but there are a few shortcomings that left me feeling disappointed. The first is the lack of a trickle-charging feature. Once batteries are charged, the unit shuts off all current to that slot. Weeks later, that same battery will not be fully-charged. This has caused problems for me when I pull batteries from the unit expecting a full tank and end up needing to swap batteries sooner than I would after a fresh charge.Which leads to my second complaint. According to a FAQ sheet included with the charger, when a battery is placed in the unit, the DONE indicator will flash if it detects high voltage from that battery. I don't know if that means that the charger thinks it's fully charged, or over-charged. Using my example above, the unit will not let me tap up a battery that has been sitting for a few weeks. This results in a shorter run-time in my microphone as opposed to charging a depleted battery after being used. I'm not sure if the charger is looking for voltage levels or amperage levels in determining whether or not a battery needs to be charged.The conditioning function would seemingly solve this problem but for some reason my unit won't cycle these batteries if the DONE indicator is flashing. It will cycle other batteries, though. The workaround is to partially drain the batteries using another device, then use the condition feature on the charger, but this extra step shouldn't be needed.Maybe it's just a quirk with these particular batteries I'm using, but they don't seem to be profoundly different from other low-discharge Ni-MH AA batteries that charge in other charges. More on that below.The best battery charger I've ever used was sold by Radio Shack. I think it was one of the earliest pulse-chargers made. It has four bays for cylinder batteries and a 9-volt slot. It had an LCD display on the right side showing charging status and battery voltage. It also featured a conditioning function that worked on all batteries I used (except 9-volts), a built-in battery tester, and it trickle-charged batteries as well (except 9-volts). Thankfully I have two of these and would choose it over this charger. Unfortunately, I don't think it's manufactured any more.Would I buy this charger again, and is it worth the price? For me, the answer to both is no. If it were closer to $50, then maybe.One feature I do like about this charger is the slow-charge option. My understanding is that repeated rapid charging wears out batteries faster than slow-charging. That's why I would steer clear of chargers that only charge batteries rapidly."
265786,2,"I recently ordered these after using Wondfo w/ tremendous success in the past. They were always sensitive and never gave false positives or evaps. This batch was my first experience with the pink handled Wondfo strips, so maybe that has something to do with it. Out of a pack of 25 Wondfo strips, 4 of them had obvious pink lines almost immediately, and all 4 were beta-confirmed false positives. I got 3 before the beta (one the day of); the 4th came AFTER my beta with hCG confirmed at zero. I should note that these lines are thinner than the control, like the dye is pulled to one side. (This is the same type of line many of the cheaper blue-dye tests tend to give). I suspect those with thicker pink lines should be a great deal more hopeful!"

403141,0,"I chose this bar out of the entire range of Organic Food Bar because it's the only one that doesn't contain agave nectar at the time of buying. Agave nectar is a dubious sweetener that on first look may seem like a fantastic substitute for refined sugars but is probably not. Just google for the side effects of agave nectar to see the possible long-term effects. It probably doesn't matter much if you take agave nectar infrequently. But if you take food bars sweetened with it every day, it adds up quickly.Taste-wise, I was quite disappointed because it tasted too sweet for me. There's perhaps a need for the manufacturer to look into using other methods to preserve the bar without over-relying on honey. Because of the ingredients used (the base is made of almond butter which tends to harden too much), it's also a little too hard and oily for my liking.Other than those mentioned, the ingredient list and nutrition profile of this bar actually look very impressive. Lots of proteins, as well as plenty of quality stuff used (organic dates, honey, brown rice protein, flax, quinoa, raisins and sesame seeds).But one thing to note is, except for the almond paste, you won't see much of everything else that goes into this bar. You'll probably see a few sesame seeds here and there, or bite into 1 or 2 raisins, but that's about all. I figured that the rest are either in powder or pulverized form and have been so thoroughly mixed with the nut butter that there's no trace --smell or sight-- of them left.Unless improvements are made to the taste and perhaps texture, I wouldn't consider getting this food bar again."

397762,0,"I like the trimmer, and would give it 3-1/2 stars. It cuts nicely and is relatively quiet.However, the vacuum works poorly, and is not a worthwhile feature. It captures a little more than half of the trimmings. So you not only have to clean up the bathroom counter, but also empty the vacuum receptacle.Compared to my old Remington, it is an improvement. It has a rotary motor which is much quieter than the Remington's reciprocating motor. It cuts easier and holds its length setting better. However, the Remington's pop-up mustache trimmer was more convenient, because this trimmer requires changing out the cutting head to convert to mustache mode. But since you have to brush out the area under the cutting heads anyway, I guess that's not a big minus."

27437,2,"I purchased this in hopes of using it for the first time. I opened the package and was appalled: the container was damaged/dented, there was no protective seal on it (on the inside), and there was only half the powder that should've filled the container. Im very upset with the purchase and even more upset that I cannot send it back and get a refund. Thankfully Amazon gave me a refund, but I would not purchase this protein online again. Better buy it in person so you know everything is correct."
245920,0,Saftey features are great! But that is it. Machine has very little power. Not at all what I was looking for and am very dissatisfied.

68107,1,"I don't know about the other varieties of this bar , but the Chocolate Raspberry Fudge bar is great for a meal-on-the-go or a quick lunch. If there is any problem with them it's that they are so good, I could become adicted to them."
173128,0,"I'll start by saying that anyone who takes a large amount of flash pictures (especially event photographers) in one session will benefit from the features of this unit. It does what it says it does, and that is nice.I deducted one star because of the price - $130 for a plastic box and a proprietary plug is obscene.I deducted one more star because the person designing this unit apparently never actually tried mounting it on the camera with the supplied tripod mount. I have the 20D with the vertical grip/battery pack, and this pack not only looks bad when mounted on either the camera or the grip (hangs over the edge - does not fit with the lines of the camera), but more importantly, it slips out of place easily (it it only held with a single screw and a rubber friction mat). Since it hangs over the edge of the camera, I am constantly having to tighten the pack every time my hand pushes it out of place.Also, with the vertical battery grip, it is nearly impossible to take vertical pictures with that shutter release - it is much easier to take them with the primary shutter release. I didn't want to take another star away for that though.All in all, I would say that this was a good idea, but was poorly executed by Canon. This is the only Canon product that has been a disappointment to me. But if you need the extra flash power, it will get the job done."

355591,2,"The insert did not help my foot problem, decided on another type of gel product, much more effective. But the 11-14 mens size was a pain to reduce to size which wasn't accurate enough.

399164,1,"After practicing yoga and meditation regularly for a few years, I have developed an intuitive sense of when I am deeply calmed. When I reach this state of calmness, I can feel my whole body throb with my heart rate, I can then ""clock"" my inhalations and exhalations to my heart beat. I also see distinct visual patterns with my eyes closed. But I never knew if these sensations were indicative of a good practice of meditation or if I was just imagining the whole thing. The Healing Rhythms method works very well for me. It was a pleasure to see heart rate variation and Galvanic skin potential applied to the ancient practice of meditation in a visually pleasing manner. I can achieve all the visual targets using techniques I have honed through my intuitive practice. The instructions that precede the biofeedback exercises are quite nice themselves but it sometimes feels a bit inadequate. Yet if you stick with it you can usually divine what you need to do (or what to let go) to reach the final state. I find myself closing my eyes during the practice and seem to get to the goal without much feedback."
174664,2,"Regretably, due to sports related injuries and arthritis problems, I have to wrap my leg from knee to ankle every day. The bandage must be six inches wide or it slips and cuts off circulation. Ace bandages of this width are hard to find locally and have tripled in price in the last several years. For hygiene and to preserve their elasticity I rotate 4 bandages, and at that they last no more than a year. I was surprised to find this bandage so reasonably priced, about 20% of the Ace. It is double the length, so only one per day is needed. The problem is that the elastic is weak, causing the bandage to slip. There may be another application for someone else where it would be fine, for me it is useless."

For most of my life asthma, summer allergies, winter sinus infections, and frequent colds, bronchitis, and pneumonia have been my status quo, but since my introduction to Umcka six years ago that has all changed. I have no idea why this product has had such an impact, am simply thankful that each year I'm healthier than the last. Best of all, each year I seem to need the Umcka less, so I know that my overall respiratory health has greatly improved. No more down time from allergies and colds, no bronchitis or pneumonia for the last six years, no lingering sinus infections, and best of all - asthma inhalers that expire unused.

I take a lot of pills every day and these are the only ones that are simply too big to swallow comfortably. I'd sooner take two or three smaller pills. I tried cutting them in half, but then the jagged edges were even more uncomfortable to swallow.I won't be buying these again for that reason."

392833,0,"We loved this tub when my son was first born. The sling cradled him very comfortably. Now at 4 months he is too big for the sling. He seems very uncomfortable sitting in the tub without the sling. When i use the slanted side for newborns, it seems to squish his little &quot;boy parts&quot;. He is still too small for the other side which sits up more. We will try this tub out for a few more weeks, hopefully he will grow to like it a little more as he gains more control. The drain plug is nice, and it fits great in our sink. The slip resistant pads keep him in place too."
35001,0,"I use this product a lot. I love being able to wax at home. But the issue I have with this is that there's no way to keep wax from dripping into the heating area.I think at this point if I want to remove the tin of wax, I have to heat the entire thing up before being able to pull it out.Other than the drippy factor, it works really well. I've never had to worry about it over heating, since usually I turn it on and leave the room until I know the wax is completely warmed through.The pegs on the bottom of it don't balance the thing entirely well, but it doesn't skid around or tip over at all. But if you're unfortunate enough to not have a proper counter and just a stand-alone sink that you place it on, you will risk dumping the entire thing into your sink."
253447,0,"The product is just fine for me, I have used this brand for many years. However, this product continues to increase in price and I have bought it here before.

I recommend it, but the technology could be better. Tips: don't move the machine when operating. Place cuff on precisely. Change batteries often. Stores history of two people, which is great if you need to report your BP history to your doctor. VERY easy to use."

49119,2,"My wife and I are on a tight budget, so I really wanted to feel justified in getting this. Our carpet isn't top-of-the-line, and it could really use a little refresh. My carpet is about 2 years old. We don't have pets, but we do have 2 toddlers that spill everything everywhere.I divided a 4 ft by 4 ft section of carpet in half and marked both sections with white electrical tape. I followed the directions step-by-step in one section (which includes sprinkling the powder, grooming the carpet, and allowing to dry), and vacuumed the other section in my usual method. Neither section of carpet has any major stains.I brought my wife in and asked her to tell me which side I used the powder on. She couldn't tell the difference. It did smell nice in the room, but both sides look exactly the same. To me, it seemed the the Zorb side had a slightly darker hue, but otherwise I couldn't tell the difference either.I do feel a little bit like a sucker for shelling out [...] bucks for a nice smell. I'll include photos of both sections of carpet in the ""Customer photos"" section of this review. Have a look for yourself. I shot the carpet with a Nikon DSLR and off-camera flash, white balance set to ""flash."""
188401,0,"This is a pretty good program. It's clean and non-complicated, but comprehensive. You will appreciate it...if you can actually download it.

Finally after two weeks, I started calling all the numbers at headquarters. I left 5 messages for everyone including the President of the company. No one answered or returned my calls or emails. My question was never answered. Apparently, I'm not the only one with this issue, either. On the message board, some answers were dated several MONTHS after the post. As a last resort before sending it back, I tried different fixes myself and finally figured out my problem. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY CUSTOMER SUPPORT! I began to think that the company dissolved.

I thought I would try this since the water pik would always leave water all over the medicine cabinet and always made our bathroom look not clean.

I was on the phone for less than 3 minutes. great product(if you have great water pressure) and great customer service."

401960,0,"Nicely constucted cosmetically, this case possesses undeniable class. Unfortunately, the interior design is ill-conceived.This case opens to about 225 degrees, meaning the open wing will point downward to the floor. The spring clip holding the cigarettes in the case isn't strong enough to secure its contents, which will fall to one's feet from simple gravity unless care is taken to hold the wings of the case level.Should I ever feel need to walk around and light cigarettes with undeniable class and to demonstrate my sense of geometric perfection by holding an open case parallel to the ground, I might be motivated to become accustomed to this. Until then, it will suffice to use my old $5 stainless steel case, which opens to 45 degrees, and can be turned upside down and shaken without having cigarettes fall to the floor"

267543,2,"I actually was looking to try California Poppy Extract when I discovered this product and all the positive reviews. Both products, I believe, have been recommended on the Dr. Oz show and I really had high hopes of finding something that would aid in helping me to sleep better or more easily. First night, I took 30 drops of the recommended 30 - 40 drops before bedtime. The taste was tolerable. There was no adverse reaction and three hours later... still no sleep. Once I finally did fall asleep, it was pretty much business as usual: tossing and turning, giving up early in the morning and awaking feeling as tired as I usually do. I also have not noticed any particular 'calming' effects. Second night, I skipped taking it just in case I might be missing some greater, more subtle feeling. Third night, I upped the dose to 40 drops before bedtime and still no difference. Fourth night, I went all out and upped the dose to 50 drops just in case there's something in my chemistry that might need a little more nudging... and NOTHING! No detectable changes of any kind. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe for some reason it just doesn't do anything to my body chemistry, but I have truly noticed no discernible difference in any part of my day or night, before or after taking this product. I will try to finish my one ounce supply just in case it takes time and, should anything noteworthy happen, I'll be happy to amend my review. I'm truly glad this product has worked for others. It just didn't do the trick for me."
201050,0,"Too many reviews of this item are either HATE it or LOVE it.Here is the real deal with these things. Yes, they give you capability you won't have with crutches. HOWEVER, there are some capabilities you WON'T have with this thing that you WILL have with crutches. I hate crutches, and I like this product, so don't get me wrong, but the folks at iwalkfree have not finished this product - it is still clearly in development and not quite where it SHOULD be for a product of this price. And I'll start by pointing out that as a mechanical engineer working with such components for industry, there is about $60 in parts here at the most and it retails for $450. For that price I want THE BEST QUALITY - but they don't put the best quality into this.The materials are good quality, and like many people say, after a couple days of practice I found it much easier and natural to use (as compared with day one). And I love this thing for what I can do with it that I can't do with crutches. But I also hate this thing for the few SIMPLE things they could have done to it to actually make it useful for the variety of activities during the day.Most importantly, the straps on this are quite strong, but take FAR TOO LONG to remove. There needs to be a FAST way to remove these straps, and there are certainly straps out there with quick-release clasps that could do the job, but they have placed latches on this thing that make it a pain in the neck to remove - so much so that I dread the notion of having to take it off and put it back on because it's just too darned time consuming. If I need to get something done quickly, this thing is not what I grab - I grab the crutches. I only use this when I need to be able to use my hands while getting around the house, or when needing to walk longer distances.Another problem is that the design of the height adjustment is awkward. If I want to change height, I need to adjust EVERYTHING. This is important because of the swing-through issue with this device. On flat floors, no issues, but going outside and walking on uneven grass can create a desire for one-notch lower on height. But that's not a good idea because you can't do that without readjusting everything. They need to change it so that a person can choose between a few (maybe 3) height positions easily. This could be done by changing how the knee carriage and straps interface to the pole. The way it's designed, one must tackle uneven ground MUCH more slowly than possible on crutches, even though on even floors this thing can be faster than crutches.Another problem is the knee pad itself. Although it's mostly quite comfortable in terms of padding, the knee pad is prone to causing sweat on a bare leg (a summertime problem). So a person needs to put some sort of absorbent fabric over it, and this is not so simple to do with the latches the way they are. It would be nice if they could include some sort of fabric swatches (maybe with velcro attachments to the knee platform) to prevent skin sticking to the rubber knee pad. A low cost enhancement to a pricey object.Walking on steeper slopes is not as nice with this as with crutches. With crutches, a much steeper slope (up or down) can be tackled. With this, you are limited by your swing-through clearance (height adjustment).Also, although I can walk a LOT with this thing without needing a cane, I feel I need a cane for any set of steps that have two or more to climb or go down. One step is OK (like a curb), but two or more needs a railing. In many places, a railing is NOT installed for 2-3 steps (many homes have 2-3 steps to get to the front door, but no railing), and this is a place where one can fall easily.Last, as a person unable to drive while needing to use this, it's also a pain to get into and out of a car - and the person who is offering me a ride has to wait that much longer for me to get into and out of their car. If they fixed the latches to be quick-release and quick-attach, maybe this would not be such a big deal. But since it takes so long to remove and re-attach as compared with crutches, it's a real nuisance when dealing with cars.Three stars because I truly get to be able to do some things I can't do with crutches. But it gets points docked for being so pricey yet so rudimentary in terms of capability. They COULD make this thing MUCH faster to put on and take off - MUCH more ergonomic. But they don't because they know they are the only game in town. They won't be for long if they don't fix these issues."

212790,0,"This is a great tasting all natural energy drink. And if Amazon.com could ship it consistently (or even carry it consistently) then I'd be more inclined to give it four or five stars. As is, Amazon.com sometimes removes the product from listing and other times takes a month and a half to ship the drink. I'm an Amazon Prime member and a huge fan of both Amazon and Amazon Prime, but this is one product where they really fail to deliver.I've switched to Rockstar Juiced -- It's cheaper per case, shipping is free direct from the Rockstar web site and they delivered my cases to me in just four days at no cost. That's the way it should be."

90105,0,These new dry-bricks are a little overpriced comparied to the old style grey dry-bricks and probably only last 3 months in the desert.

209282,0,"I don't really understand the marketing hype about these things being ""digital power"". My husband (who is an electrical engineer and knows a lot about such things) says most of the claims on the packaging to make these batteries unique are just simple hype. The fact is, they're batteries. Just batteries. No better or worse than any other batteries, no better suited to certain products than any other battery."

140482,0,"The Omron HEM -7901T is a high quality blood pressure monitor however the main reason I purchased this item over others was the T model gives you the capability to upload your readings into a computer, which it does. The BIG problem and I want to say that again BIG Problem is the interface cable is so short it is very akward to have any latitude of where you can place the monitor. I have contacted the manufacturer and they do not have a longer cable nor do they recommend trying another cable that does not have the filters at each end. So, if your main objective is to upload the measurements into a computer you will be very inconveinced due to the lenth of the interface cable."
365577,0,"The looming problem with stainless steel appliances is the upkeep--the maintenance, the fingerprints, whether you have children or not, no matter how careful, neat, or clean you are, there is plenty of upkeep with stainless steel. That is the one big reason many do not buy it--and have learned through experience, including myself. Anyway, since I was re-doing my kitchen from top to bottom, I threw out all of my old white appliances with absolutely no, or very little upkeep, and replaced them all with stainless steel--KitchenAid and Dacor appliances. I have a review of my refrigerator on this site, as well as a few stainless steel products.I used the Weiman stainless steel spray, and it is, well, all right, but, then, I figured, I'd try the wipes. As my title says, it's an average product--nothing out of the ordinary.You apply it, but then you must wipe and wipe and wipe and wipe (get it) off the product with a paper towel. Over and over, over and over. And press hard to eliminate streaking, but you will never eliminate all the steaks---with this product, anyway.There are countless stainless steel cleaners to buy, and I have tried many. Most were average to below average. Do know that some appliances have different grades of stainless steel, and no matter what you do, it's a lot of maintenance."
99804,0,"I ordered the Vanilla not realizing it has sucralose and artificial flavoring. I do not like the artificial taste.It's bearable, but I just dislike the taste of sucralose and would rather not put it in my body.Other than that it seems fairly average in regards to how well it mixes. That is, it has some small clumps like other whey protein powders I've used. Oh well, 5lbs will go quick enough. Next order I may try this product unflavored and just add some vanilla myself.Or I may go with a Vanilla whey powder that has some natural sugar in it. Live and learn. I wish Amazon did a better job of posting accurate nutritional information on the foods and supplements they sell."

However, the light does not seem to improve my depressed mood. The effects equal drinking extra coffee without getting the harmful caffeine. Thus, I am not certain the benefits of this light warrant its cost."

106612,0,Although the product works in the shower- the shave is quite rough especially the first few uses. It recommends only using shave foam not gel so that is a bit odd but even with that option there is still significant post razor burn even when using it wet. After the first three uses it is still no match for a regular razor but i will see how it goes for a whole week and then make a final decision.

216729,0,"Items were received in a timely manner from the vendor.Regardless of the vendor, if you are just starting choline, my recommendation is to start conservatively.It was recommended to start off with 2,000 mg daily (8 capsules) to improve memory function for a relative. *This was too much.* Side-effects of irritability and headache were onset within a day. Reduced dosage to 250 mg (1 capsule) and symptoms went away. Gradually increasing this by 250 mg per week, and no symptoms observed with 750 mg (3 capsules) per day.It is too early to speculate on its effectiveness, as we were told it would take about 3 months before any benefits, if any, might be observed.This is our experience, and yours may be different. Just be conservative and do not expect an ""instant"" transformation of memory, brain whatever, .... Finally, I seriously doubt you can expect a significant life extension better than just controlling your diet, regular exercise and reading."
183309,0,"I bought this for pain; I was pleased at the price; the product worked well enough, it just wasn't a dramatic effect. The price was right, delivery was on time, so it's not a bad deal. I have since purchased it again."

359714,0,"The Chillow pillow does what it purports to do. It makes my head more cooler and comfortable when sleeping. The only flaw is that the interior fill tends to bunch up in a corner of the pillow, requiring a special procedure to correct. Perhaps the speed in which this occurred, (several days) is because I tend to toss and turn a lot when I sleep. A more placid sleeper may not experience this problem. Nonetheless, it basically solves a problem I have long had when sleeping, especially during the warm summer months and I recommend it to anyone who experiences uncomfortable warmth in the head area when sleeping."

117269,0,"If your goal is to have a condom that NEVER comes off then this is the condom for you. Other than that I cannot recommend them. You simply cannot feel much with these condoms. ""Iron Grip"" is an accurate statement because they are so tight that it just wasn't pleasurable. Granted, I am not HUGE by any means but these were too tight.

285237,2,You never get the same reading twice it keeps on going up and up and eventually it will show that your kid/ baby has fever which I already know by kissing the forehead and seeing the crankiness. But in the first 2-3 measurements show that he doesn't have fever. So you can not rely on this. If he is doesn't have a fever it will go up and eventually it will go down but it varies by 2-3 degrees each time you take a measurement. Absolute piece of junk!
412171,0,"I think the Biosafe people did a fine job. The instructions that came with this kit were clear and straightforward, and the cholesterol report I received was very comprehensive. The whole experience was quick, painless and simple; if I had visited a doctor for a cholesterol test, the copayment alone would have been more than the cost of this kit. I don't have any reason to doubt the accuracy of the results - they were reasonably close to the last doctor-administered test I had.However... I wouldn't have bought the test kit if I had seen the authorization form first. The form, which they say you must fill out completely, asks for a lot of personal information: social security #, age, height, weight, phone #, email address. (The SSN request seemed especially out of line - I gave them a phony number.) At the bottom, after the usual liability waiver, it says your signature indicates ""I wish to be notified about products and services that relate to my health"". There's no checkbox to opt out of this: if you want the sample tested, you have to sign the form, and that apparently puts you on some marketing list. I think that's despicable.I had already paid for the test, so I signed the form. But I'm not happy that some telemarketer or spammer now has my name and other personal data. It's been a month now, and I haven't gotten any calls or Biosafe spam, so maybe I'm overreacting."
315033,1,"Im in the military and while in route to the Middle East (14 hour flight) my legs swelled to an enormous size and the pain afterward (3 days) was unreal. Some medics recommended Futuro Stockings. I bought a pair and wore them on my return flight home to the United States. Wow, these stockings are a must have if you have swelling of the lower legs. When I took the stockings off my legs looked like normal, no swelling, no pain, no indentations from the socks. I was surprised and pleased, I will now NEVER travel without a pair of Futuro Knee Length Stockings. Money well spent."
42506,1,"This is one of the tubs of protein I keep in my regular rotation.The three things I care the most about protein powders are nutritional content, taste, and blendability, and this passes all three with flying colors. This has a great ratio of high protein to low calories and fat per ratio. I always get the chocolate, although I've heard good things about many of Elite's flavors. It mixes well and tastes great with either water or skim or soy milk just by stirring or shaking, and is even better when I spend the effort to actually use a blender (milk, vanilla yogurt, fruit of your choice, ice, and powder = incredible).I was able to pick this up on sale for ~$35, which is one of the best prices for this amount of powder, and this is simply a better protein than the other ones at that price point."

44324,0,"These are large pills, so keep that in mind if you have trouble taking large pills.But what I really want to comment on is the price- these are expensive. It's not bad for a 90 count if you take one per day.

Taking that into account 90 tablets lasts 22.5 days. This is a less than 1 month supply."

This little peanut is strong but if your going to invest money into something get something strong but larger. It can sometimes get annoying holding it too because its so small.
169216,1,Good stuff. made some gains in just a few weeks. no cramping. good idea to do a load faze for 3-5 days. then take daily for about 4-6 weeks but should take two weeks off to clean your system out. i will buy again. also use a good whey protein with it should boost your results.

The only difference is that the local ones are manufactured in Brazil and the ones I received in this order are made in New Zealand. But as I said the quality seems the same so far. My only complaint is that I also ordered an excel razor handle as part of the same order and although they were all shipped together, I was double charged for shipping. This Is the same as I would have paid if I had ordered them as two separate orders and received them in two separate shipments. Otherwise I would have given a five star rating."

And that is in spite of the fact that the music-to-massage has been broken since we purchased it (NEW, UNDER 'Warranty' from a liquidator I worked for), and one of the pressurized arm cuffs quit working about a year and a half after we bought it.And, there is the HUGE downside. There is no service, no way to contact the Satori company, no easily available source, even, for me to get the manual and do repairs my self!! This is an enormous negative for a product that costs more than a used car. I am ready to go to the address in Cerritos and see if it even exists -- a gent on the internet has gone so far as to look up the owner (a sole proprietor, according to his post) in an effort to find support for the product.So, if you are willing to risk having a $3000.00, 250 pound non-working investment taking up the space normally allowed for a LOVESEAT, then by all means, buy it. Otherwise, I recommend going to a source like a chain store or someplace where you stand a chance of getting attention if you have a problem.

306771,0,"I have had this brush for about 8 months. My dentist said that my teeth are much better from using it. It is easy to brush with. The only problem I now have is that the metal part that I stick the brush on has rusted. I am not sure though if this matters, because I don't think that it will ever get into my mouth because it is inside the brush, but I am not sure I want to keep using it, because the thought of putting rusted metal into my mouth scares me. However, it is a great toothbrush, and maybe the rusting was my fault. I would recommend getting it, and my dentist is pleased with it too. But I think I am going to get a different one, because I am scared of the rust.Edit: I noticed that some of what I thought was rust might have been dirt, however some of the metal corroded. I put on a new brush head and it works fine, and I am going to keep using it. In the meantime I tried the sonicare advance from phillips, but I found it to be too bulky. The Oral B is a much more comfortable brush to use, and the brush head replacements are pretty inexpensive too.I would probably give it 4 stars instead of 3 now."

In the beginning, I used mack's pillow soft ear plugs, but then after 3 days, it would start leaking water into my ear. So I switched to mack's aquablock ear plug, still does't fit, water leaks in. Then I tried arena ergo, I figure since it's the most expensive swimming earplug on amazon, it must worth a try. It turns out hurts my ear, I couldn't even fit it in. $16 down the drain. Finally I tried howard leight aquaseal ear plug, WOW, waht a difference, perfect fit, never leaks. I am so happy. I am never going back to other brands again."

Was a little skeptical, thinking there was no way I'd get a smooth shave and expected some stuble. However, I'm very impressed! I get a good shave, leaving my legs very smooth. There was light razor burn after the first time or two using it, but that went away quickly. I find that I do need to go over the area a couple of times in different directions, but its still faster than a traditional shave. It even did my bikini area pretty well. Its not so great with underarms though, requiring numerous passes, which tended to irritate.Overall, a good product."

I've lost 20 lbs, been working out at the gym lifting weights, etc, and haven't lost 1% in body fat. I had a body fat analysis done at the gym and the results were WAY off from what this scale does. The scale said 33%, the gym said 15%. Truth lies somewhere in between probably, but I don't buy the 33%. So in conclusion, good scale for weight. Not for boby fat calculation."
183283,0,"The photo may lead customers to assume that this product can be used as a hand-held magnifier. it can't; it is truly a stand magnifier. In other words, it must lie flat on the surface you're trying to magnify. The part that looks like a handle is just a large battery compartment (you'll need two C batteries). This magnifier requires battery-charged illumination because there's no other way sufficient light can reach what you're trying to magnify. That's why I was so disappointed when, after only a half dozen uses, the little bulb burned out, rendering the magnifier useless. I still think it deserves 3 stars because, when its bulb worked, it offered a large degree of magnification without distortion."

You're able to hear the baby's heartbeat but, if you are a fat mama like me, you'll have to wait until about 24 weeks and listen really well. I actually got the doppler anyway.The product is really well made and shipped very quickly though. Overall, decent purchase."

197906,2,"I use Scott's Tissue, and it's good long lasting tissue. But I can get it at the local grocery story in a 12 roll pack for around 8.00 when it's not on sale. When it is on sale I can get it for around 6.50 for a 12 roll package. That means I can get 36 rolls for 24.00 and change at the normal price, and 36 rolls for 20.00 and change when it's on sale. I'm not about to pay Amazon 15.00 more for 4 more rolls, even if it's shipped to my door! This is way over priced, even if it is good tissue paper. I'm giving it 1 star because of Amazon's price issue. Just sayin'. Some folks need to do some math."
359318,0,"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!"
3213,0,"I had a Vibratex Bear for years and loved it. But the dual action broke...and it was just slightly too short...I was always wishing for just a half-inch more. The Doc Johnson iVibe I replaced it with was long enough, but not quite thick enough; then the gears and motor started grinding and screaming.Great King is the perfect size, at least for me. The clitoral stimulator is -- well -- amazingly stimulating -- better than any of the ones I've used before. Only thing is the ""skin"". It is very smooth, too smooth. I sorta miss the subtle raised patterns on the iVibe. Other than that, this product gives a great internal workout. Insertable length is 6"", diameter: Body 1-1/2"" and head is just under 2"". Soft enough to give a little, hard enough to do the job.""Personal product"" marketers please take this to heart--Publish insertable length and diameter, please.

297165,2,"I normally use another brand of liquid echinacea but Amazon had this brand on sale so I opted to give it a try. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. For a start, the provided glass dropper doesn't work because it is sealed shut; not clogged, but actually sealed shut like there was never an opening at all. Secondly, there was some sort of fine beige powder inside the dropper, which I knew should not be there. I have been using liquid echinacea for over 10 years and I have never seen anything like this. I took the rubber lid off of the glass dropper and about an eighth of a teaspoon of that fine powder fell out. I have no idea what it was but I know it should not have been there. The product arrived sealed in cellophane so it had to have come from the plant this way. I found a spare glass dropper and decided to try the actual liquid echinacea, but when I put the allotted number of drops into a glass of water it was cloudy and murky looking. Now perhaps this brand of echinacea is supposed to look that way, but the brands that I have used in the past never appeared cloudy or swampy looking, so I didn't even bother to taste it. Who knows what was actually inside that bottle - it sure didn't look like liquid echinacea to me. I've learned my lesson; from now on I am sticking with Herb Pharm."

412417,0,Because I just received this and have just started using it I rated it low. I haven't had enough enough time for a fair evaluation of the product but based I past reviews I decided to try it. I like reading the reviews before I purchase something and in most cases they are very valuable.

289538,0,"I'm not a medical professional, all I needed was something basic for home use (actually to track down a bees nest inside a wall). I gave it 3 stars based on casual home use and low price, but if I needed something accurate for real health monitoring I would not recommend it and would have given it 2 stars.Pros - cheap, and you can hear vitals from a basic perspective, makes a great toy for a young person who is curious about medical stuff, and is ok for just general around the home use for the price.Cons - uncomfortable no matter which earpieces you use, and the sound quality is not very good, would not trust this for anything important! Found it difficult to hear vitals well, not clear, doesn't compare to professional / expensive ones at all."
222597,0,Can't beat the price but as per the other review runs a little small. with a 33-36 waist would opt for large size. i bought the medium given a prior link that had stated it would cover this size range. Otherwise good product.

56243,2,"First, please realize that any review of a personal lubricant is going to be subjective because everyone has different expectations of a product like this. With that said, I do not recommend this product. I am working my way through all of the top brands of silicone-based lube in order to find the one I prefer. So far I've tried 4 of them: ID Millennium, Swiss Navy, Wet Platinum, and Gun Oil. Of these, ID Millennium ranks dead last for the following reason: it is too viscous (thick and heavy), allows too much friction, a lot more of the product is needed to remain comfortable, and is not at all ""silky"" as I experienced with the other silicone-based products mentioned above. The ID actually reminds me of using heavy petroleum jelly when I was a kid...not pleasant! I would recommend any of those other brands before this one because they are all much more silky than the ID, which enhances sensation. This product actually seems to diminish sensitivity. Of the 4 I've tried I would rank them as follows (best to worst): 1) Gun Oil 2) Swiss Navy 3) Wet platinum 4) ID millennium. The ID was so uncomfortable to me that, after 2 or 3 uses, I gave up on it and purchased a bottle of Swiss Navy, which I think is the best value because it seems to last the longest. Hope this helps."

393636,0,"This tub worked well for the first 4 months. Our son was 5 weeks early but we only used the hammock for the first bath - it just didn't appear to be sturdy enough. The recline position allowed our son to splash and have fun in the bath but he seemed uncomfortable where his bottom rested against the raised plastic area meant to keep baby in position. Since he was still too young to sit upright but obviously uncomfortable on the recline side we retired this tub and moved to a bath tub cushion which works great.If I could go back in time I don't think I would purchase this tub again, but there was nothing wrong with the product itself."
427097,0,"purchased this bath scrub instead of the one i usually (dead sea products) get, because it was larger size and cheaper. The smell is not near as good as dead sea and granules are smaller. It is ok but for a few more dollars i prefer dead sea salt scrub."

288417,2,"Hasn't performed well from day one. My own fault as I went for a cheap set instead of investing money into a model that would fulfill my needs. This model overall just feels cheap. Additionally, the blade arrived off center and remains so to this day, no matter how many times I've tried to adjust it. At times it works well enough but too often I can't tell if it's actually trimming any hair. Not worth the money, pay a little more and get a model that actually works all the time."

425309,2,I was given a mirror such as this from a friend who had since she was a teenager. when she gave it to me she was 48 and I've had for about 10 years after. Then it finally retired. So I bout this new one just like it. It only lasted six months. first the mirror failed then the plug attached to the mirror failed. Things these day are not made to last. Won;t buy another again.

365368,0,I bought this trimmer after my old cheapie Wahl unit died. I am not overly impressed. The unit does at best an adequate job of trimming. It really falls down on closeness of the trim and ease of getting at all the offending nose hairs. My old Wahl unit excelled on all counts except occasionally pulling a hair. Unfortunately the Wahl unit isn't made anymore. The vacuum feature of this unit is a nice idea but I didn't perceive any particular benefit.
49244,2,"I used this for a short while and was very pleased with the taste. As far as refined fish oils go this is the best one on the market. The reason for the 2 stars is I and most other have no Idea that this and most other fish oils contain artificial vitamins and the fish oil itself has little benefit after deodorizing and processing. Because so much of the natural goodness is removed they have to add it all back.I wish there was some sort of consumer protection label to warn people about this many would still choose to take it but the more health conscious would search for more natural sources of vitamins.There are still a few brands out there that do unrefined Fish oils however you do have to deal with the taste,fortunately there are capsules and the liquid pump as well. Vital choice salmon oil is awesome with high natural vitamin A & D There is also Fermented Cod liver oil by Blue Ice High A & D . Fermented is the traditional way it has been made for thousands of years and the healthiest. It is more expensive per bottle but you need to take less so it comes out even in cost.If you see a fish oil high in EPA and DHA and low in A it is most like been highly processed.Consumers want High EPA & DHA so they alter the oil it does not come naturally that way from a super fish."

123918,1,"I love this thing. You do have to stop exercising to take your pulse, but I use it mostly for biofeedback. It is so great to use when I'm having a panic attack and cannot keep count myself. What I love most is that it's not expensive, but you don't have to wear any sort of strap around you!! And you can wear it just like anyother watch."
257839,2,"While the product works it's good. It was capabable of trimming eyebrows, sideburns, beards & mustaches, and that pesty stray nosehair. The problem with the MicroTouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless. It is not worth the money. Buy a product that costs more money and is better quality."

213821,0,"I purchased this trimmer in November 2008. It initially worked great, cut smoothly, and held a charge for at least 1-2 shaves. After roughly 1 month of use, however, the battery would not hold a charge. I called Wahl customer service and had a replacement unit shipped to me. After roughly 9 months of use (only using the trimmer 1-2 times per week) the battery again would not hold a charge. I still am able to use it for about 5 minutes after charging overnight (enough for a VERY quick shave), but needless to say I'm not very pleased with this product overall."

81758,0,"Claritin 24-hour allergy tablets is a good product if you just want to try it and see what the buzz is all about, but if you have allergy problems that could last months or seasons this is not the best product on the market considering the time span of the dose and the price comparison to other brands.For many years now I have utilized one small red Sudafed pill and it works perfectly. When Claritin came off the Rx market I tried it along with a coupon and found the blister packaging difficult to remove a tablet.Since I would take the tablet by 6:30 am each morning it was working for a full twelve hours. According to the box though I could not take another tablet in the same twenty-four hour period. So basically I feel this is misleading because this stopped working repeatedly after twelve hours and I had to get through the bedtime battles with pestering allergies. The past month also had some big weather changes here as the temperatures soared into the 80 degree mark for one week and the winds were kicking up dust all around. I did not like the position I was in where I could not take anything to relieve the uncomfortable feelings associated with the watery eyes, runny nose and itchy throat.I would not recommend this product over the other options."

27825,1,"Got the Tropical Punch flavor for the first time and to be honest the taste is horrid. It is basically the artificial bubblegum flavoring you find at the dentist when they use fluoride treatment (the only way I can describe it). I doubt whey drink mixes are ever going to taste ""good"" but this is definitely not tropical punch, I was imagining koolaid or something!. I would suggest sticking with the flavor you like or usually get. Other than that, the powder blends easy with a spoon and works better than other brands in my experience."
96175,0,"I was looking for a device that would trim everything - neck, beard, mustache, but unfortunately the Andis T-Outliner is the wrong tool for this. It's OK trimming short hairs where the hair is fairly stiff. But on beard hair - say 1/2"" to 3/4"" long, it just pushes the hair over. For mustaches, the blade is way too wide to easily trim the line just above your lip.As far as ruggedness, this thing is built like a tank. It is heavy and solid and houses a heavy high speed motor that could cut your lawn. The cord is made with a nice soft rubber that flexes easily. This trimmer is surprizingly quiet. It vibrates at a very fast pace - your hand gets a massage while trimming your face. If you push the trimmer flat against your neck while shaving it will massage your neck, but it's not necessarily a good or bad feeling - it's a high speed vibration. It comes well oiled and a small tube of extra oil is included in the box. I bought some extra oil and I predict I'll never use it.Bottom line: it's well built and OK for what it does, but don't plan on shaping your beard or trimming your mustache with it."

406728,0,"I've only been using these for two days (15%) and while it's too early to see what the results will be, the product is somewhat painful to use! I just had my teeth cleaned, so I know I don't have any build up or problems, but when the gel gets on my gums, it burns and stings. I do not have sensitive teeth or gums. I've been tempted to take them out after only a few minutes, but considering I paid a lot (since I purchased through my dentist), I leave it in despite the pain. I'm going to use the suggestion from another review and try to run a q-tip along my gums after I put them on my teeth, but I unless the results blow me away, I don't think I'll be using again."

29070,0,"I got this as a gift for Christmas after getting fed up with my old Wahl beard trimmer. I have to admit that the magazine ads sold me on this product, and I kind of regret that. But it's not without it's good points.The good:-The beard trimmer works fine and trims quickly and precisely.-Quick charging-Extremely easy to clean, and can be rinsed with water.-Shave in the shower.-An acceptably close shave, but not the best you could get from an electric.The bad / the ugly:-A charge doesn't hold for very long...several shaves at most. Luckily it charges back up to full capacity again in an hour.-Shaving can take FOREVER because this razor simply REFUSES to cut some hairs, no matter how much you run over them. Most of the time I get so frustrated that I just switch to my Norelco.-It feels like you're holding a lawnmower, and it's almost as loud.-There are only two settings on the beard trimmer attachment: fairly long (for my goatee), and really short.-I experienced much more razor burn with this razor than with my previous ones.All in all, this razor will work great for you if you want an easy cleaning beard trimmer. But if you are looking for something to shave your face with quickly, look elsewhere. I highly recommend Norelco razors, as mine has lasted me six years on one set of razor heads and still outperforms this Braun."
10156,0,"Met Rx is an interesting powdered drink designed to build muscle but I bought it as a dietary supplement for being too under weight. The nutritional label is as follows : 2 scoops = 200 Calories, total fat 0.5, cholesterol 10 mg, total carbs 3 grams, sugars 2 grams, protein 46 grams , ( yes thats 46 grams not a typo ) calcium 85 grams, phosphorus 592 mg, magnesium 48mg, sodium 140 mg, potassium 190.The drink does boost your energy and I don't see any caffiene listed as an ingredient so it must be a combination of enzymes that activate your electrolites. It actually kept me awake at night so I only drink this once a week. The vanilla flavor is NOT as great as the chocolate variety. This stuff can be mixed in a blender ball with purified water. Makes a great breakfast drink. I MUST mention this is a 2 lb container dry measurement and it is VERY EXPENSIVE. ( I paid upwards to $50 per container for the chocolate variety in the past ) I think I can do better in price with similar energy drinks."

And it still misses. The battery life is only good for like 15 minutes or two body parts. It won't work while being plugged in, which is utterly stupid. I would guesstimate about 83% of the hair is being pulled from the roots. The rest are being torn off just above the surface. I should have spent more for an Emjoi."

222430,1,"I normally do not write a review. But I'm so impressed with this product I'd like to share my 2 cents. I disagree with the review that said it's not better than a suction bulb. It is 1000 times better! I have a baby who has a stuffy nose ever since he was born. It was a nightmare every time I used the suction bulb. My baby would cry like there's no tomorrow, and still, the bulb didn't take anything out. When it did, it stopped suctioning just as the snot is at the tip of the nostril, and baby will naturally breath it in again unless I wiped it out at a lightning speed... The battery aspirator keeps on suctioning until you release the button which will make sure that the snot will be completely out from the nose. Initially I was hesitant to buy this. The first time I tried it didn't work, but after reading the manual again and following the instruction, it worked like magic! You have to angle the aspirator at a right angle with the nose. Because my baby has sticky snot, not watery like the kind you see on a runny nose, I didn't see the snot go down to the collection cup. But when I checked my baby's nose, it is clear!! Apparently, the snot was stuck at the wall of the suction tip. I just suctioned a little water to clean it, and there was the snot ... go down to the tiny cup. If your baby has dry and sticky snot, I suggest spraying a little bit of saline mist on each nostril first before suctioning them out with the aspirator. It works for me... every time. This product is a sanity saver. Now, I don't have to feel like I'm abusing my son every time I clear his nose, which is what I would feel when I use the suction bulb. Definitely worth it!"
66973,0,"When comparing Sally Hansen's hair removing product along with Nair body and Hair no more, this is what I have determined. The Hair No More stinks the least by far but is less effective than the Sally Hansen and Nair products. Hair No More is almost twice as expensive per ounce and requires similar volumes. Hair No More is the least irritating and least stinky product but also rather weak. If you are looking for an effective workhorse for your legs and don't mind the stick, Sally Hansen gives you the most bang for the buck. If you are using it close to your genitalia, than Hair No More is the safest. Walgreens and CVS stock Sally Hansen and Nair."

This isn't a high tech item, if that matters. I told them that, then they wanted me to take pictures and send the photos to them. If the item isn't right, or even if the customer just thinks it is not right, it should be a no-brain ""send it back for an exchange or refund"". This AmericaRX outfit isn't someone you want to do business with. Kind of like buying from e-bay.

I went by the sizing that Diva recommends and I think that was my mistake. The size 2 was way too big for me. I had a lot of trouble getting it in and out, and forget about being able to rotate it to get it to seat correctly. I had to do so much fiddling around that it was painful. Not a fun place to be painful!I did a little research online, and found a Youtube video where someone showed and demonstrated several of the different brands and sizes. I settled on the Lunette size 1. It's so much better.I didn't have a problem with this brand really, and I love the idea and how it works.

My purchase came with a bunch of free samples which I thought was pretty neat. Now for the tinted moisturizer.. I haven't tried too many TMs so I can't really compare.. but this moisturizer is alright. I purchased it in Nude and it turned out to be too dark on me. That or the color oxidized? later in the day. You might need to purchase two different colors to get the right shade (which is pretty expensive). It does delivery buildable coverage like a foundation almost. I think the Oil-free one (the one I have) is not as thick as the regular one however so the coverage is more sheer. To get to the point, I think this is a good, high end tinted moisturizer and I probably would like it a lot more if it was my shade."

257412,0,"Milk and banana at bedtime is my mother's remedy for good sleep. It always worked; I have known that since childhood. What I discovered myself is that every time I had a dinner of rice and garbanzo beans or eggs, I slept deeply and soundly. Digging deeper for the reason traced it to tryptophan and carbohydrates as the common ingredients in all these.Tryptophan works best for sleep in conjunction with a high carbohydrate dinner because carbohydrates increase insulin, which in turn increases the uptake of tryptophan in brain to increase serotonin synthesis, and that is helps melatonin synthesis, which puts you to sleep. Calcium magnifies the effect of tryptophan on sleep by augmenting the conversion of serotonin to melatonin. Milk and dairy products have all these ingredients and work best for sleep. The downside to this approach is high calories and potential weight gain.A glass of milk (0.08%) and a banana (0.01%) have about 2000 mg of tryptophan, equivalent of four 500 mg tablets. In my experience taking three to four 500 mg tablets works best for sleep. What I found is that supplement increases the allergy symptoms because tryptophan is also involved in histamine synthesis, which mediates allergies. Sometimes I have also had hangover with tryptophan and melatonin supplements but not tryptophan rich food. However, I do not notice allergy symptoms with tryptophan rich food. If you take supplements for few days in a row, the effect wears off; not so with tryptophan rich food.The big downside to supplements, of course, is the potential impurities that can get in with the supplements. In 1989 a syndrome called Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was linked to 2 impurities, EBT & MTCA, in Tryptophan from a Japanese manufacturer. At least 37 people died from that illness. As we all know, Congress & Senate are for sale, and like the Wall Street, Supplement industry has bought a share of the legislature and avoided all regulation.For me personally, exercise in the evening and listening to audiobooks really put me to sleep and are the best sleeping aids, without any disadvantages. Tryptophan, taken in the form of dairy products (milk) and banana at bed time help. Occasionally I have used tryptophan in pill form, 2-4, 500 mg pills taken with about 1000 mg of calcium work really well.Update 10/1/2009: There is lot of batch to batch variability in the quality of this product. So far, I have tried 3 different batches and one did not work at all. This indicates poor quality control in this unregulated industry of supplement manufacturing."

It would be helpful if the company differentiated more between the detergent and softener. I have to stop and take a close look every time to make sure I am picking up the right product and even used the softener instead of detergent once. Yes, one is white and the other translucent, so they aren't the 'same'. But how hard would it be to enlarge the print stating 'softener' or 'detergent'. This may not be a problem to young eyes, but for me it is close to a deal breaker.One other note. If you are allergic to any soy products, do not use this. Itching guaranteed."
341349,0,"My doctor advised me to wear compression hose after a leg injury damaged veins in my lower leg. He thought it would be especially beneficial after I began running again. My first hose were below knee closed-toe stockings, but I didn't think they looked very ""cool"" with running shorts. So I bought these thigh high stockings, thinking they would look more fashionable. While running, the top would slide down and bunch up around the knee. I had similar problems when not running and wearing long pants. In fact, it was a little worse, with the tops being pulled down below the knee sometimes due to friction with the pants during daily activities.Even when the tops were still up, I found it irritating while sitting to have the compression fabric wrinkling up behind the knee. I use them only for running now. They stay up fairly well when tights are worn over them, but garters are a necessity with shorts or pants. They would probably be okay for a person confined to a bed or recliner, but I would advise an active person to stick to the below knee variety.I was concerned that the elastic band going around the foot might cause blisters or other irritation while running long distances. That did not prove to be true for me. Since I have long feet (Men size 13), the band was near the front of my arch and was hardly noticeable."

2031,0,"I just discovered a bunion forming on my left foot - it's not that bad so I can't say how well this works if you have bad bunions. This is just okay on mine, which was barely noticeable in the first place. It does seem to straighten my toe well - but my main gripe is the comfort (or lack thereof).A velcro piece goes around your foot and loops around a long plastic piece (you can see this in the photo), and then back again to velcro onto itself and close. In order to get it tight enough to have any effect, it has to be so tight that the plastic piece digs into my skin and it's very uncomfortable -especially since the idea is to use this as night. Also, the velcro doesn't seem to go in to the slots easily and it pinches my skin. Again, this may be because my case is minor and I need it tight to see any difference. It does work, but I find myself not wanting to use it because it's really uncomfortable and kind of bulky. The actual padding is kind of big for my (female) big toe.On a side note, when I received it the padding was discolored. It doesn't affect the functionality but I was disappointed anyway."

178204,0,"This is one of those baby items that I know I could live without, but now that I know it exists, I don't want to! As a new mom to a 7-week-old, this has become indispensable. Yes, I could write down the times my son eats, gets his diaper changed, and sleeps, but that requires me to do math (albeit simple) in the middle of the night when I am a sleep-deprived zombie. With this, I just have to push a button and the next time that event happens I can see how long it has been, which is the information I really need. I love that there is a ""free"" button that you can use for whatever. I push it when my son is done breastfeeding because he tends to take awhile to eat and I am curious how long each session is. Yes, this might be a little better if it could remember data, but I think that takes away from it's simplicity. I should also mention that this thing is worth it for the clip and light alone! I clip it to my shirt during night feedings and the non-intrusive light doesn't wake baby, but it helps me see what I am doing and keeps me from tripping over things on the way to the rocking chair in his room. The 4 star rating is because I am on my second itzbeen because the clip broke on the first one after just a week. I bought another one before I even sent the broken one back so I wouldn't have to live without it for too long, though!EDIT: The clip broke on the second one after a few weeks, but I still used it and the nightlight is still handy, but I am changing the star rating because it's pretty much just a light now. I downloaded the app ""Baby ESP"" and it is SO much better than this! I take back what I said before: being able to store data is WAY better!"

Mix is lumpy, and one either has to wait several minutes for the drink to ""soak"" or use a blender. I would buy it again, but only if it was the only flavor available from Syntha-6."
26384,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.
190159,0,I think this lube is suitable for tight b... and so bad for loose one.my wife did not like it
371674,0,"This product performed as expected, but it was very expensive. There are much cheaper brands of this product available at most drugstores.I ruptured my Achilles and needed surgery to repair it. After the cast came off, I needed a brace to keep my ankle flexed while sleeping.There is no good sizing information on Amazon. If you go to the OTC website, they have a sizing chart. I am a men's size 9-1/2 and according to the chart I should have been a large. The large was a little too big and felt like it would slip off (although it never did).Before the brace arrived I tried using an Ace bandage to keep my ankle flexed. This worked well, about on par with the brace. Given what I know now, I would have just stuck with the Ace bandage."
238245,0,Cute but small. Would be ok to add with other candles. Probably wouldn't buy if in a store. Not worth it to return.

I much prefer and recommendSunfood MSM Lotion/Cream, Pure & Natural, 8ozwhich is also available in 32 oz size from various sellers. While I prefer unscented, this lotion is available in Berry Vanilla, Orange Ylang Ylang, Coconut Rose, and Medicinal (Tea Tree Oil)."
320263,0,"I'm satisfied with my blood pressure monitor,although like other reviews have mentioned, several numbers on the LED screen are incomplete, although they can be deciphered. I'm not sure if the monitor is totally accurate, but my results have been consistent. Overall, I would say the monitor is worth the price."
322755,2,"After reviewing several top diet pills i thought this would be a good one. however, i read the same EXACT reviews that were posted on amazon on several other sites. Ok, so maybe these people really wanted to get the word out on this product... nope. There are no individual ""positive"" reviews here that i have not read, word for word, on another site, more specifically, driectly on Lipoxinol's site."
51401,0,"After reading dozens of reviews on this product, I decided to try it out. After an hour, I got as far as my knees, and couldn't go any further because it really hurt, and the process took so long to try and get all the hairs. The worst part wasn't the hair being ripped out... the worst part was the month of insane itching after using it on my legs -to the point of scarring (and yes, I did moisturize everynight). I was going to return the product, but decided to give it another shot. So, the second use, still itchy, but by the third use, which was done this week... my legs are for the most part itch-free. Also, I still have to shave on top of using this product as the little hairs aren't picked up, and I want to be smooth. So, it may be cheaper to just stick to a razor."
5990,0,I am a little disapointed as the BPM readings are far different from the doctors monitor. I purchased one as I have been suffering from high blood pressure. As I live a considerable way from the doctors I wanted to keep a check myself. I checked my BP at home before going to the doctors and then had it taken at the doctors but the difference was considerable. So I can only assume that the one I purchased doesn't give a good reading.Patti
87131,0,This was not good for me as the product was not deliver on time and also was missing the strips... Then I had to get the missing parts from out side.
205914,0,"I thought i was getting the 5mm width, that's what i wanted so i could be sure of the result. Instead i got a very thin strip. I went ahead and used them but was not pleased b/c i had a hard time telling if the opk was positive. The test line was almost as dark as control, but only half of the line, so i'm not even sure if i even ovulated this cycle. The opk's where suspose to be babyhopes brand, that is what i paid for, and nowhere on the package does it say that, it just says clinical guard. So in the end they where just ok and i will not be purchaseing this brand again. Buyer please beware of the advertisement, b/c i did not get what i had exspected."
1981,0,I didn't see any effect on my skin I have a horrible acne and I saw in the internet to drink some Vitamins A and E for my skin but I dink this thing every day with Vitamin E and C but I didn't see any result. If you guys want your acne to be gone you guys should take a Phantotenic acid (Vitamins B5) because that is the only product in world made my acne gone.
343691,2,"This stuff is awful! What a waste of money...it leaves a thick, white layer on your face and even after rubbing it in as much as possible it leaves your face feeling greasy. I broke out almost immediately and had to throw it in the garbage. That money went right down the drain, grrr."
69569,0,"This is a nice product, but watch out with colored items and hot water. I used it to take a stain and it did; but it also removed some of the color of the item in question."
123859,0,"The form of B12 used in this supplement is quite inferior to natural alternatives like the methyl' and hydroxy' form. Sadly, they use cyanocobalamin in this product. The form of b12 you should be using is ""methylcobalamin"", the natural and superior form of B12. The ""cyano"" b12 in this product is manufactured synthetically and your body must convert it methylcobalamin before utilization. Moreover, methylcobalamin is better absorbed and retained in higher amounts within the body tissue. Additionally, molecules of toxic cyanide are created after the body has transmuted the cyanocobalamin into methylcobalamin. To remove the cyanide molecules, your body must now consume glutathione supplies to expel the cyanide via your kidneys.""Natural Factors"" sells methylcobalamin b12 in 5000mcg sublingual tabs, -for which I've been supplementing with for over 4 years now. In the morning, take one 5000mcg sublingual on an EMPTY stomach; try not to eat for at least 30minutes, this will allow for maximum absorption. Within 5 minutes you should feel a tingling surge of clarity, which should linger for at least 30minutes. Alongside your mental clarity you will now experience a sense of renewed emotional balance, which will build up as you take more b12, and will last you throughout the day. This balancing effect will help you maintain utmost tranquility while the outside world continues on.Please, always remember to eat a healthy diet. Minimize alcohol, minimize sugar, minimize caffeine, minimize gluten, and, DO maximize consumption of healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts (peanuts are not nuts), and lean proteins. Moreover, always remember to stay positive in life, -maintain an emotional distance away from negative people until you become stronger within yourself. If you don't they will surely bring you down by contaminating the positivity you've worked so hard for...Here are some of the most common symptoms of b12 deficiency (do you experience any of these?):* Chest pain or shortness of breath* Fatigue or unexplained weakness* Dizziness, trouble with balance, and fainting* Confusion, memory loss or dementia* Coldness, numbness or tingling in the hands and feet* Slow reflexes or diminished nervous system function* Pale skin or yellowing of the skin* Sore mouth and tongueThese symptoms above are caused by lack of B12. Your healing of these symptoms may be postponed by cyancobalamin consumption...Please note; you can effortlessly achieve renewed vitality with ANY higher dose ""methylcobalamin"" supplement. -And of course a diet with little to no processed foods, alcohol, sugar, or caffeine."
368679,2,"I really like the trimmer in that its recharging holder plugs directly into the wall, the design is great, and does a descent job at trimming, but the blade guard has broken twice. It is so brittle that after several uses it falls into pieces. I have contacted Panasonic to see if maybe there is a replacement guard that is improved such as a thin metal. I don't think they even offer parts since I could not locate the model number on their website.I suggest saving your money and choosing a different trimmer."
149076,0,"I had originally bought this product for the benefit of Vitamin E, but what I was thinking! At 5000 I.U. mixed with six other common carrier oils hasn't shown much effect. I have found other Vitamin E ointments (at 100 I.U.) that are far more superior for fast healing of fresh scrapes and scars.One other nitpick I have about this product is the bottle it comes in. The cap is not all that handy, just snapping the cover shut sends any product remaining in the lid flying through the air. A pure annoyance sometimes and I find it best to just unscrew the cap and pour out the amount that I need. Either way is still messy.But what I do like about JASON's Pure Beauty Oil though, is that it does well as a light carrier oil for diluting and mixing essential oils in. It makes a good base for aromatherapy skin treatments, especially for dry skin. It also has a noticeable scent of it's own, a warm, sweet, almond aroma.The ingredients include: sunflower oil, rice bran oil, almond oil, apricot oil, avocado oil, wheat germ oil, Vitamin E, lecithin, Propylparaben and fragrance. Contains no mineral oil or artificial color. And since I prefer to mix my essential oils with one or two carrier oils, it is quite likely that I will not purchase this product again. Less is best, but not when it comes to Vitamin E."

186694,0,"I read a lot of reviews on amazon that said this stuff was very tasty, but I don't agree. It has a strange taste and is very gritty. I mixed it in a blender with fruit and sometimes a sugar substitute to make it palatable. I won't buy this again."
343522,0,"I received my Waterpik, and within two weeks, the pump failed. A replacement unit was sent and received within ten days, but there was a large piece of plastic rattling inside the unit. I am hoping the third one is a charm. They are a great product and do an excellent job,- when they work. I have decreased my dental visits because of good dental hygiene, and these units contribute greatly."

175000,0,"I purchased this after reading about the virtues of many of it's Ingredients inThe 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman.When I took off the cap -- I nearly fainted from the smell. The smell is so strong that it stinks up the cabinet with the lid sealed. My five year old took a whiff from the bottle and ran away gagging. I now threaten to open the bottle if he doesn't clean up his room. His room is spotless for the first time in 3 years. Holy Cow, this could be a secret biological weapon, seriously.I have emailed Source Naturals about the odor and hope to hear back soon. My bottle says "" best if used by ""7 15"". I take that to mean July 2015.Have none of the other reviewers noticed this smell? If so, why hasn't anyone mentioned this? There is no substance that my wife or I have ever smelled that even approaches this. I do realize it contains things like ""Garlic Bulb"" but OMG. Hoping the pills sewn in my garden will repeal insects this spring. A terrorist could cause a airborne panic by opening this bottle on an airplane. This is an orafactory curiosity."
385826,2,"I ordered this based on all the good reviews. When I received it I tried it out and could only hear heart sounds very faintly. Have definitley used better, clearer, louder stethoscopes before and this one was practically useless."
213083,0,"I love the chocolate version of this shake; and the nutritional aspects of Isopure for my low carb life. But the vanilla has, to me, a faint pineapple taste, and is so watery it doesn't fill me up AT ALL. Won't buy this flavor again."
178216,0,I have a 9 month old and went to see my BFF who had just had a baby. I spent a week with her and she was given this as a gift. We are both type A but with a new baby it's just hard to be type A. It's ok just to feed the baby. She only used the feeding time and the side switch features. She felt the rest were not needed. I could have used the side switcher when I 1st had my baby. But it ended up a few weeks later the babe had lost a few ounces and the Dr. said just to feed her when she was hungry not every 3 hours etc so she wasn't using it at all at that point. I do think it also had a light on it...that would be helpful. Probably an extra not a necessity.
244414,2,It doesn't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed. I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor. Atleast It has a taste.

236855,0,"First of all, when I received this product it was leaking all over the place. you get a lot of product for the price and I love that it is a natural option. It foams relatively well, but the scent is not what I was expecting. I love lavender, but this version is not my favorite. I was just say it is an ""ok"" product...didn't blow my socks off."
260827,0,"The quality of this vit. C seems to be decent. However, after only 3 months, the powder started turning brown, indicating oxidization. For this quantity of vit. C, they should include an oxygen absorbing packet, or maybe sell it in sets of smaller containers to prevent it from going bad."

311368,0,We like the product (we have ordered it before from a vitamin store) but these were ALL broken up inside the bottle! Very disappointed in this retailer.
371567,0,"This blade is much more of a showpiece than anything usable for shaving. If you're a collector or are putting together a corner of the bathroom for retro beauty, you could do a lot worse than this blade. The handle is not plastic as written previously, it is wood and the rivets are pretty solid but the blade is completely not suited for shaving."
187163,0,"Somewhere I read that this tastes almost identical to cow's milk, so perhaps my expectations were too high. I do not like it by itself, and that is why it is receiving three stars. I want something that I could have with a chocolate chip cookie, and this just doesn't work. It has a sweet malty taste. Don't think vanilla shake - it's more like instant breakfast or vanilla SlimFast. It works for cereal if it is seriously watered down. I haven't tried it in baking, but I have heard and could imagine that it would work great in baking. I like that it is powered because it is easy to keep some in my purse when I travel. I do have to say that my husband liked it and said that he doesn't mind drinking it by itself."
387274,0,"I am giving this candle 3 stars because as a candle it is good. It burns nicely and seems to have a long life. I took off 2 stars for the actual fragrance of the candle. I love Mrs. Myers Lemon Verbena fragrance and use various products of hers with that fragrance. For me, however, it does not translate well to the candle. I did not like the smell at all. It smelled too much like a cleanser for me to enjoy the candle. I might buy another fragrance choice of this candle, but I would not buy the lemon verbena one again."
394404,0,This item needs more improvement. I have to hold my daughter up because the net that comes with it was sinking into the water. There is no back support for the kids. Your kids out grow the tub too quickly for it to be a infant to toddler.
424331,0,"Product works as specified, however, it is so bright my eyes hurt. No way to shield my eyes from direct view, so I turn it to face the wall. Not satisfied with this design. Wish I'd spent the $350+ for the lamp that tilts, I have one of those at my office and love it. PS, light therapy has saved my bacon every winter. Now I need it to re-tune my Circadian Cycle so I can fall asleep and wake up when I need to."

62041,0,"This tub was great when my son still fit into the mesh hammock. But its not so great while he's in that transitional stage. He can't sit up well enough yet to sit in it but he's too big for the hammock. So I use a towel to line the bottom so he can sit up a little and he's propped up sitting on the bump on the bottom. Works okay but I go through a lot of extra soaked towels. He sure loves to kick his feet in the water while he's sitting up now though. The hammock was great but now he's starting to enjoy playing in the water too, which the hammock really won't allow for."
221295,2,This product is a terrible waste of money. It's totally inaccurate. Never even comes close to matching readings in the Doctor's office nor readings with my Omron blood pressure machine. You can't rely on this machine and if your blood pressure readings need to be tracked on a regular basis for health reasons you'll be throwing your money away and risking your life using this machine.

390628,0,I ordered this drano max but received drano gel. So i guess my review is on drano gel which seemed to slightly increase the speed of my sink draining. It would have been nice to receive the correct product
66711,2,I made the mistake of assuming the battery operated was a rechargeable battery. It runs on AA batteries which means you'll get better trims using a wooden block.It has virtually no &#34;umph&#34; to the blades which simply pulls instead of cuts.I went back and got a $10 more expensive blade that has a rechargeable battery pack and has a higher blade rate allowing for a true cut.
321395,0,"I would definitely be very careful when taking this supplement. I did experience a boost of energy with this, but at the cost of serious sweaty hot flashes and kind of a hyper state. Not what i was going for but since i can't have caffeine, i might take this in a pinch if i'm really tired but not as a regular supplement."
354551,2,I concur with the previous review. This protective cap appears to be a cheaply made knockoff and it is just enough too small to not fit onto the shaver head. Shaver Outlet says they have tried them and they fit fine on the ones they tested. Guess I'm just unlucky....
88791,0,"We got the safer bather because I just didn't want another hunk of plastic laying around the house and this was more like a soft pillow. Our baby seems very comfortable in it at bath time and when she was very small, I used to put her in it to change her diapers.The only down-side so far is that while submerged in water, it absorbs a lot of water. While this is great because it keeps the baby nice and warm, it is SO difficult to wring-out afterwards. And it gets SO HEAVY!!! I usually have my husband do it and then we have to hang it in the shower for at least a day to drip-dry."
348600,0,It would better serve my purpose or use to have the product available by the case instead of packs of 3. I think it would be easier and cheaper to ship by the case. I also would like to receive my whole shipment at once.
342844,0,I Just never got the stuff. I had to have a refund done. I could not believe it took so long.
382887,0,"This cocoa butter was an ok moisturizer but not something I'd purchase again. I've tried using it in different forms: scraped straight out of the jar and then just rubbed on the skin until it's soft and absorbed, scooped into a bowl then placed the bowl in warm water to soften it, added a little coconut oil to soften it...this butter just didn't seem to sink into my skin well enough or give a long lasting moisturized feeling. NOW's shea butter did a much better job for me, but I personally might just need a more intense moisturizer.On the plus side, this stuff smells great and it helped to soothe my sister's bug bites. I'm sure it can be a sufficient moisturizer, but maybe it's only for those who have average skin instead of skin that's very dry."
378939,0,At my son's baby shower I was given a simple tub you the type sold at Walt-Mart along with a foam=like cushion... I must confess I had registered for the Safety 1st bathtub hoping to get. Well my son is now three and half months and has grown the simpler tub so I purchased the Safety 1st bathtub.... I must say that the beging I had a hard time getting to seal correctly so that the water wouldn't leak it is simply a matter of extending it completly and pressing down with your palm in the middle it even has picture in tub itself so that you don't forget.... I do agree with the sling problem byt was simply solved by hugging my son with one while bathing.... I suggest reading the instructions throughly.
400668,0,"I used the sport inserts in my running shoes. I liked the extra cushion they provided during my runs.

208967,0,"If you consider pushing the dust on the blinds into the strings of the blinds cleaning, then these will work for you. I have found that if you close the blinds and lightly spray with the appropriate cleaning solution for your blinds and wipe with a cotton cloth, you get much better results. It's quicker too. By the time you line up the slats of the blinds and get them in this thing you could be half way through cleaning one side of the blinds. I don't think this would be good for aluminum blinds because trying to line them up and get them into it may bend or kink them."

292172,0,"The taste is fine, but the texture is terrible. It's very gritty and feels like you're drinking sandy water. I mix it with a shaker and no amount of shaking takes the grittiness away. Maybe mixing with a blender wouldn't be so bad?"
193321,0,"I started using this product in its pure form in 5oz hammer gel re-usable flasks, grimacing the stuff down while quickly chasing it with water. I found cutting the gel with 1:1 ratio of water to gel helped getting past the non-pleasant flavor. The problem with the orange flavor is that it tastes more like thick simple syrup, with very little if any ""orange"" in it. This tends to overpower your taste buds. The taste aside, the product works wonders. I noticed the difference using the gel made immediately. I was able to ride farther without much muscle pain or energy drain using the gel than what I had experienced with a couple of energy bars eaten while riding. I would skip orange altogether and try something more palatable, like raspberry."

Green tea extract does contain many beneficial antioxidants such as EGCG, but also poses certain risks because it is not a whole food, and label precautions must be followed. This whole food product has none of these risks. But what benefits does it deliver? The label only lists green tea leaves as the sole ingredient. We offer a premium green tea vegetarian capsule product (Guardian From the Earth Whole Food Green Tea Capsules) where the nutrients (EGCG, catechins, polyphenols) are listed on the label, and they are competitive to green tea extract products without the risk."

378319,0,"My son is 7 mnths now, we've used this tub since he was 2 months old. As stated by Rachel Hall, you do have to read the direction. It does insert in itself after use, but you have to make sure it is fastened to use it again. I did not use the green ring while I gave my son a bath when he was younger. Of course, we also live in a apt. too, and this is too bulky to be using in a sink or counter top, we use ours in the bathtub. It has great suction cups on the bottom to keep from sliding. Now, my son is old enough to sit on his own, and we use the ring, but I'm still a little afraid of it popping out of the place it clips down to on the bottom and sides of the tub, because of him leaning into it as he plays with the water. The infant reclined insert is great, but if your baby is a wiggler, they'll slide right off. Plus the insert doesn't keep your baby's head off the edging (which is suppose to have foam), it just doesn't have enuf cushion for a young baby's head. Can be a pain to pull up off the tub after bathing, but that is what you get with the suction cups it has."

I took them in the morning at 930am and it is now 646pm and I feel like my heart is still slightly racing (even after exercise) and my right arm is a little tingly. And I've felt like this all day. Oh and approx. 45 mins after taking, I felt like I could run laps around the office, so um, yes, definitely TONS of energy.I am going to scale back the dosage to one pill in the morning and see how I feel. If early-mid afternoon I feel ok, with no side effects, I will try a second pill. I think for me,that will be as much as I can take in one day.I suggest strongly to take a minimum dosage and work your way up accordingly.Good luck everyone!"

As I'm spending some time in the US, I figured I could still do it, and avoid the expensive salons.I think the main problem is the wax itself.... the texture seems like glue, and it's really difficult to remove it.I've read another reviews and apparently the secret is to use some baby powder... Another secret: use a really thin layer.The heater is great, so maybe the best is to just buy the heater and get the wax somewhere else."

You know like when you have really low batteries? Exept I used new batteries.and the same with the second one I bought. Actually the second one was worse. At first you only saw parital numbers then they just faded completely!!! I don't know maybe it was just sheer luck or maybe it was a bad batch. I hope that this item is not just poor quality manufacturing. Im a new mother and am still trying to get used to the hectic schedule. However, I am going to try and get it somewhere else. I will also give a review on that and let you know how that worked out if it even does or if I have to return it for the third time!"

As to the product itself, it seems to help my son with his car sickness. When he gets nauseous he'll put these on and typically feel better in 15 minutes or so."
317731,0,"Ok, I'll admit right off that this is not the exact model I had. I had one that was a step lower and is no longer available. Like many reviewers have already said, however, all Norelco razors are nearly identical. The model I had also had this jet clean system, and I do not recommend it. The base in mine had shorted out, and by cleaning the razor everyday, I was also charging it everyday, making battery life less than stellar. If I went to my gf's for the wknd, I had to bring the charger. After about a year, my razor needed new blades [were getting dull, then one fell out and into the toilet]. $30 for new blades or $30 for new razor entirely... I got another cheap Norelco. This time I'll just rinse it under hot water and save $60 a year on the jetclean."

348564,0,"Well, I have a really hard time swallowing pills, so thought I'd try out a chewablevitamin. The reviews talked about a decent flavor, so what's the harm, right?Let me explain the harm!First off, if you buy these for kids, be SURE to keep them locked up somewhere.They taste almost identical to regular gummy candies, and it would be very easy for a childto eat quite a bit of the jar. I don't know what that would do to a child, but it can't begood for them in any way.Now, as an adult, I took 3-4 a day. I am hypoglycemic, so I do watch when I eat.I quickly found out that these things must have an incredibly high glycemic index, because they hitme like a brick! I quickly learned to either take them late at night when I was ready for bed,or just before a meal that would have protein to balance it out.The thing is, it really doesn't balance out much. To make matters worse, they gave me a ferociouscase of the munchies! You know how if you eat something with a lot of sugar, you seem to want moreor are hungry feeling in a short while? That certainly describes these vitamins!How do they manage to make vitamins palatable to chew? In this case, a LOT of sweeteners.The first two ingredients on the list are GLUCOSE SYRUP and SUCROSE, both of which are fast-actingsweeteners. Each bear has 7.5 calories, 2 grams of carb and one gram of sugar. That is quite a bit fora healthy product. The only ""healthy"" thing that has more sugar I can think of are the pre-flavored yogurts(which are VERY high in sugar, which is why they can say they are low fat. There is no fat in sugar).It is better to buy plain or vanilla and add your own fruit or jellies.Anyway - it was my first and last bottle of them. They gave me a bottomless pit appetite that I don't normallyhave, and if not taken with a meal can definitely cause blood sugar spikes and dips.Since it has that effect in adults, I just can't see them being actually good for children."

219770,1,"Hi... I researched a lot before buying a rechargeable battery especially when my energizer get 'de-energized' barely a month while lying in my drawer without being used! I found out that Sanyo was currently the best, so I ordered the 2700mAh high capacity and 2000mAh precharged (eneloop, white label), low discharge batteries. Here is what I observed after charging the batteries and observing them with a digital multimeter, after 2-3 weeks while stored in my shelf without being used:2700mAh battery had 1.31V and about 2100mAh capacity.The 2000mAh batteries had about 1.39V and about 1900mAH current.My verdict: the 2700mAh is really not the 2700 capacity, but slightly better than slow discharge PROVIDED you want to charge and use the battery immediately. In my case, I use batteries occasionally and so the low discharge eneloop ones are better since there is always some charge left whenever i want to use the batteries, enough to allow me to click several pictures with my digital camera. Moreover, I hate to see batteries in low charge state whenever I want to use them, so for me the pre-charged eneloop ones work best as then can retain charge for several months. In my opinion, due to practical situations, the precharged, low discharge eneloop are better, but in case you would like to have a little more juice in batteries and want to use it for immediate use, go for the 2700mAh."

78302,0,"A little bit quieter than a box fan set on medium. The pitch isn't in the noise blocking range either. A box fan has a lower pitch.If your room is nearish a road, you will still hear traffic, mostly trucks. Lawn mowers, snowblowers, ect. Anything that's a lower throbbing pitch.SO...If noise is the problem, this item alone probably won't mask it completely. The reviews that state it's exacly like a box fan must be using pretty wimpy fans.When I first got it a year ago. I knew it wasn't going to be enough. In fact I was so disappointed that I said to myself ""This isn't going to be used much"" and ""this is going to be tossed in the attic/closet"". But, I turn it on every night. Relocated it close the a window, where the noise source is. But I also bought a air cleaner that I run on high also, which adds a bit more to it.Unfortunally, it's still not quite enough. But I use it none the less. In the summer I add a box fan in the hallway also. And that pretty much takes care of the noise problem and I sleep a little more soundly."

127143,0,This is a great mask if you don't mind buying another one after a few months. The edges are not sewn but glued together and it all comes apart within a few months. It does a very good job at keeping light out but it did take me a little bit of time to get used to the 'nose' of the mask sitting on my nose. Even that little weight felt like it was blocking my airway. I wanted to cut that nose off but then light would seep in around my nose. I just wore the mask loose around my head and a little higher on my face.

I've only found one bar that isn't awful, the only compromise being it supplies only 12g of protein, but is no less filling and contains a full days of food-based vitamins. The 4Life bars by ZingGo are the only ones even remotely pleasing to eat that are also in the healthy spectrum. I bought this Organic Food Bar due to the recommendations, but for an equal experience mix some almond butter and protein powder and possibly a few pieces of sidewalk chalk, form into bars, and eat."

25935,0,"After a couple bad experiences with DigiPower and their battery chargers they sent me the DPS-3000+ as a replacement for my older DPS-1000 unit. This item came with four (4) 2300 mAh AA NiMH batteries. A nice break from their older chargers this one comes with an adapter and a nice long power cable so you no longer need to find a free wall outlet to completely cover with your charger. The unit will charge either AA or AAA batteries and either two (2) or four (4) at a time. It also features an automatic trickle charge feature so batteries remain 'topped off' with no danger of over charging. It's relatively speedy at charging batteries. It is compact enough to fit on the corner of your desk or anywhere convenient. And it doesn't get all that hot like their older chargers used to. I keep two batteries 'fresh' in the charger and two batteries in my camera at all times and it seems to work well for me. All in all it's a good charger for the money. Although DigiPower's customer support leaves something to be desired (long contact delays, misread emails, etc.) they're willing to back their products fully."

I have been on MANY different diets throughout the years and so has my husband, and we both agree that this one makes us feel the best.I was really nervous to try this shake mix. I had no idea what it would taste like, and I am not a fan of Diet shakes at all. I was amazed at how many recipes can be used with this shake mix. Vanilla is so versitile, and this one if my favorite of all of the Herbalife shake mixes because you can make any kind of shake with it. My favorite is white recess, YUMMMM!What shocked me the most about this was the fact that my picky kids even love it as well. If you drink it plain with skim milk it will taste like crap, in my opinion, and you WILL have the diet shake flavor, but when you add things like fruits, sugar free pudding mixes, powdered peanut butter, spices, sugar free davinci's syrups, flavored yogurts, etc...you can create really healthy & AWESOME tasting shakes.Some might be skeptical wondering if drinking the shakes will be enough to keep you satisfied. Will you be hungry and therefore binge during the day? I felt like I was hungry the first couple of days because I was use to eating so much more and gorging myself at almost every meal. I use the protein powder from Herbalife and add one scoop to my shake mix because I require more protein.I found that the free fruits & veggies throughout the day along with the protein snacks really help alot as well. My favorite Herbalife products to use with this shake mix is Herbalifes Total Control which gives me lots of energy and the Celluloss which got rid of my excess fluids.I want to make it clear that I do not sell Herbalife, this is an honest review from someone who is using the products. THEY WORK!"

They fill me up and satisfy my sweet tooth at the same time, which helps me stay focused on my diet.

Each bar contains 1 gram of fiber and 25% of the recommended daily calcium, this is especially important to me because I don't drink milk. I keep these on hand for my kids too - they love them and the bars are better for them than a candy bar. Try the chocolate chip flavor too, they're wonderful!"

A couple of things about this item, initially it irritated the inner lining of my nostrils, after a couple of weeks, I found myself apparently removing it in my sleep. It works best when used with a homeopathic stop-snore spray. In fact, I've basically stopped wearing it and just use the homeopathic spray now with almost the same results.

422850,0,"By the way, ""pack of 2"" means that you get 1 pair of socks, not 2 pairs, as I incorrectly assumed. When I ordered these, I didn't know they were men's socks and intended primarily for post-surgical use. (I am a woman with very mild circulatory problems in my lower legs.) Even so, I find that these support socks do a great job of keeping up good circulation when one is standing or sitting for long periods of time, however, they are very heavy (think ""athletic joint support""). I like the open toe, since I find that support hose tend to make my toes hurt when worn for long periods, but the open heel is uncomfortable. Because of how thick the fabric is, if you do much walking in the socks, the edge of the heel opening rubs painfully against the back of your ankle. However, these would be great for airline travel, when walking is kept to a minimum."

154787,1,"The first time I tried Nad's, I managed to give myself bruises and bled under the skin which eventually became scabs. After that, I was scared to get near it.Almost 10 years later, I decided to give it another try. I had relocated to the Midwest from Los Angeles and my leg hairs had grown out over the winter. I felt that it was long enough to try waxing and did not want to bother with shaving because I have to take a California shower since my hot water tank is small.I read other reviews where people suggest spreading the gel as thinly as possible. The directions inside the package says the same. WOW, lo and behold... it got the job done and did not hurt much! It removed all the thicker coarse hair (I am Asian) and just left invisible peach fuzz behind.While shaving with a razor would have gotten rid of the peach fuzz as well, the peach fuzz is so light, I can only see it if I literally press my face up to my legs. I was able to remove my arm and underarm hair with the same amount of ease, too.I used very little of the gel and only required 4 strips total. 1 for each leg and 1 for each arm and underarm. Using as little gel as possible is the key to making this work. You can reuse the strip since the gel is still sticky without spreading additional gel on other parts of your leg or arm or wherever.Nad's is awesome! Just be patient with the learning curve."

They gave me an immediate refund and had me order a second pair. We thought maybe the first pair was defective. The second pair arrived and within just a couple days, I had the issue back...EXCEPT this time it was with both hands. I called the maker of the gloves. Their representative, Dawn was kind and courteous. Yet, she told me that my complaint is one they have heard before. The company believes it is from a glue used during the construction of the glove causing the issue. She said, I could return the gloves and get another pair...but I don't want to order a third pair with the possibility of the same issue. My second concern, Dawn had not heard before. The gloves seemed to work great but after continuous wear the numbness came back to my hands. The intense pain didn't return but the numbness did.

Doctors have tried for years to help me with these cramps. the only thing that did help was quinine sulfate prescription only but has been taken off the market due to its effect on the heart and circulation. anyway i've tried every thing from drinking cider vinegar, taking mega dozes of potassium and drinking lots more water, you name it i tried it. but these did help after about a month now i take them about 3 times a week .. I still get a cramp once in a while maybe two nights in a row and they are still bad but it used to be 4-5 nights a week now its less than 3 nights a month so these have helped. I recommend them they helped me and I had about given up trying and trying to deal with the cramps that left me so tired so much of the time. hey if it helped me maybe it will help you too."

The smell isn't faint at all and the scents are true to their names. Also the other scents were great also. I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot. It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products. I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too. These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself.

427037,0,"After reading all of the reviews for this product, it seems like it either works great or not at all. Perhaps there is some factor that influences how well it functions. Perhaps it has to do with the different mineral content in different tap waters? If it doesn't work for you, perhaps your water is too pure. Maybe add a teeny tiny touch of salt? Don't know if this could work, just a thought."

Well I'm here to tell you -- I pounded that handle within an inch of its life -- but it still pulled apart. Nonetheless, it works well on carpets, bare floors and is spectacular on throw rugs and it looks quite sporty with the red electric tape holding the pieces of the handle together. My theory is that perhaps the quality control/inspection of handle pieces might not be all that it could be. And the price was certainly right."

380556,0,"well well well, i've been on a long search to find the perfect razor and read tons of reviews on every razor out there. first off, a lot of people are judging this razor very unfairly because they're mad about the price of blades. well, that's life. there's a site on the net where you can buy cryogenically frozen blades at about the same price that supposedly last 4 times as long. they're a great business.amazon overall gives the fusion mixed reviews, and i've found the fusion to be a mixed bag. first, the design. i loved the mach 3 design and the gillette fusion continues that. it's definitely a better way to shave than with the old designs. also, the handle on the fusion is insanely comfortable. it's SO comfortable, it's almost as if the handle has a life of its own! it's crazy. way better than any other razor handle ever. the design is mostly like the mach 3 except with 2 blades. contrary to what you have heard, the head is NOT much bigger than the mach 3. in fact, the blades start from the top at the SAME point. i didn't have trouble shaving under my nose or anywhere else. the total blade area is slightly larger than the mach 3 which is a GOOD thing. this + 5 blades = a faster shave. add the battery ""power"" feature to this, and you're basically shaving with lightning! you HAVE to try the power feature. it's amazing.. it eliminates tugging. it slices right through facial hair. absolutely brilliant. it's no gimmick, believe me. also, the blades do NOT get more clogged, another lie. in fact, these blades get LESS clogged than any razor i've ever used. one other thing - the single-blade trimmer on the back is far from ""useless."" it's incredibly useful and does exactly what you need. it's innovative and an improvement over the mach 3. so with all this brilliance, what could go wrong, you ask?razor burn. the same problem i had with the mach 3!! i would lift my cheek up and see little razor burn all along it, and get razor burn on one part of my neck. that wasn't too bad, until around the 6th or 7th shave, when it suddenly tore up my neck with razor burn!! now, you may say i used the blade too long. however, there's no good way to tell when the razor is going to cause you problems. the lubrication strip wears out too fast, on like the third shave but the blades are still sharp. so i kept using it, still getting close fast shaves and one day it cut me up.the shave itself - the fusion definitely does give a closer shave than the mach 3, particularly if you use the power feature and a great shaving gel (in my case, king of shaves magna gel ARB formula). however, it seems to get ""too"" close in a way. my face would itch. i'd look in the mirror and see a kind of film over my skin, apparently skin that had been shaved off. not cool!! i would use the fusion if my skin could handle it.. maybe i will try using it without the power feature and see if that helps. the power is so fast & fun to use that it's addictive. but i'm afraid i may be doomed to using razors older than the mach 3..."

Also they're good if your scared to touch this loud machine to your skin.

307562,0,"Preamble (Ramble?)I have a job that puts me on my feet, walking around for a good part of the day in semi-dress shoes (as close to dress as I can stand and still walk like a human.) At the end of the day, my feet are beat. After watching ""Malcolm in the Middle""--a comedy show about a family with a mom who works in a drugstore and tries time and again to get a foot spa as a gift, I thought I, too, would love to soak MY feet at the end of the day. After some exhaustive shopping online (easier on the feet), I ended up with the Waterpik Pedicure Foot Spa FS-015.FeaturesDo be careful which model you buy. These foot spas, whether Waterpik, Conair or others are NOT returnable. (Feet are considered personal areas of your body, and returning a spa is like returning worn underwear, maybe even more difficult.) And there are so many models out there with various features, you need to know what you are getting. I found the online literature lacking. When I got my FS015, the instructions had a list of features of all the models in a table and that was far more useful than anything I found online. Except..of course, I now own this one.--Massage wet or dry--Does not heat water--Does keep water warm--can do dry ""heat"" massage (in other words, there is a heat element that can warm but not heat a lot of cold water.)--Loofa or Reflexology sole pads to insert--Bubbles, vibration and heat (bubbles wet only, of course)--NO infra red (a hard to find Foot Retreat model has an infrared panel in the center.)--Storage area for a small bottle of polish--Pumice stone to fit into a heart shaped socket.--Splash guard--Size is 6 "" x 15"" x 17""---Cord looks to be about 3.5 ""--Foot-operable switch (a dial with a long tang)--one year warranty--Weight about 7 lbs.--Soak, Scrub, and Shine feature (soak, loofa, then use compartment and prop up feet in the heel wells to apply polish.)Operation3 settings:1. bubbles, heat, and massage2. Dry massage (heat and/or vibration)3. wet, vibration, no bubblesHow to use:Warm your water to desired temperature, pour up to level mark on bath AFTER you have placed it where you want it. Plug in wall. A GFC (Ground-fault circuit) plug is recommended. If you don't have one of those outlets with a reset button, check to see that the outlet you use is on such a circuit; for example, our bathroom upstairs doesn't have one but it is directly on the circuit with the GFC below in the kitchen.You will have plopped in one of the sole pad sets that fit over the bubble outlets in the foot wells. The loofa is supposed to allow you to scrape your feet as you soak. Personally, I hate loofa as it gets wet and then as it dries can be a breeding ground for bacteria, so I intend only to use the ""reflexology"" pads with the bumps. These sets are both made of a flexible rubber-like plastic.Now, sit and soak, or use the dry heat massage. The heat isn't much. But it does keep the water from chilling down too fast.Ahh. Nice. If you are ticklish, you can dispense with the bubbler (pronounced ""bubblah"", if you are from Boston.)Afterwards, you can dry your feet and place heels in the wells provided in the splash guard. Now they are propped up, waiting for you to shove in the little toe foamy things and polish your toes with nailpolish. No more chipped polish in sandals or ugly heels hanging off the back. Very nice!WarningsNot for kids, who might kick it overNot for diabetics or others with foot issues UNLESS you check your doctor. Diabetics often cannot feel what is happening on their feet, and if the water is too hot, burns could happen. If the loofa or the interior of the spa is allowed to grow bacteria or fungus, an infection could follow. CHECK WITH YOUR MEDICAL CARE GIVER if you have any foot problems.Good featuresChoice of bubbles or not, simple design, flexible, Foot control. Can use salts for aromatherapy (not included.) Storage for something (clipper? polish?) Price was reasonable compared to others on the market. It's a nice looking purple and white unit with a clear mauve splash guard. Light enough to move about. Nice for applying polish.Bad featuresThe inevitable short cord. ""To avoid tripping."" My stars, that's a crock. when copper rose in price years ago, cords got SHORT. And stayed short. You might have to go from a counter-level outlet that is GFC (your hairdryer outlet) if you use this in the bath and this restricts where you can put the unit. I think the cord is a foot short. In the case of this spa, I think the designers did NOT consider the use-case, that is, you would likely run this off a counter-high outlet or need to put it someplace special to avoid wetting a floor.The manual is a folded pamphlet with the usual twelve foreign languages in the back and dire warnings spackled throughout. Fortunately, English is listed first. I wish it were a booklet and not a folded pamphlet-sheet. I find those easier to read and refer to. A small quibble.SummaryIf you need to soak and relax your feet, the Waterpik FS-05 is a reasonably priced unit with good features. Waterpik generally has a good reputation for durability and function. Be certain you know which model and features you really want before buying as foot spas are not returnable. This one does NOT have the massage rollers found on some competing models, but as I don't like rollers on my feet, that's a plus for me. This unit can be found online at great prices: I paid $27 but found it at the same place on a one-day sale (grrr) for $23. Check around as prices go as high as $46."

226596,0,"I am happy with my purchase, but I must say this product deserves an ambivalent review. If it worked consistently it would be much more useful. I find that I often get a false negative result - a reading of ""zero"" when it should reflect some alcohol. Therefore, I have to question the accuracy of the results it gives when I do get a positive result. On the other hand, I have seen a fair amount of consistency when used infrequently (multiple uses seems to overload the system) and according to directions - the 20 minute wait between a drink and a test is absolutely necessary. I have to say I was surprised by how quickly I can be in the ""danger zone"" - better to take my own reading (and adjust my driving schedule accordingly) than to have the police administer the test!"

It did the best job of anything I tried, there was a beautiful, high gloss and it holds up for weeks with just wiping with wet, soapy sponge. Even a mild bleach solution didn't seem to ruin it. Anything with ammonia such as glass cleaner will kill it instantly however -- cleaning the window above the counter you could see exactly where overspray hit the countertop. The only way to fix it was to give it a light sanding with a scrubby and re-apply. The real down side for me? I'm hooked on the shine, now I have to keep buying the stuff for when it wears off."

349476,0,"I once doubted the magical powers of water-wizards equipped with nothing more a flexible willow branch until witnessing the forked piece of wood literally become animated in the hands of a patriarch whose integrity was beyond question. So I'm inclined to take the testimonials of other purchasers of this product seriously.This is an inexpensive but also quite spartan ""stress-reducer,"" the instructions limited to a space not much larger than the back of a toothpaste box. If the temperature runs high, your stress is reduced; conversely, if the device registers a low temperature, you could stand to chill out a bit (i.e. warm up). At the same time, if you can make yourself relax, the device should register a higher temperature; conversely, if you can't make yourself mellow out--well, by now you get the gist. But isn't there something circular about all of this? Perhaps even a bit of a Catch 22?The key to deriving any benefit from this transparently simple device (a plain old temperature-taker of your skin surface) is not to become overly insistent about the logic behind the alleged therapeutic benefits. Go with the flow, watch the big number change, and when it goes higher rather than lower, take some cheer in knowing that you're in relaxed mode: knowing that, your chances are even greater that your number will keep climbing.One thing that you ought to be skeptical of is that ""pull-out stand."" It's flimsy and all but useless. In fact, better that it were broken than masquerade as a support for a surface the size and weight of a paper matchbook cover."

The mask blocks a decent amount of light when it is on perfectly, but if it slips at all a lot of light gets in."

Well, I bought it for a hot pack and it does get plenty hot in the micro and it holds some heat for a half hour or so. And it's weighty so it lays flat against the back of your neck and spine. But the velcro closure in the front gets pretty hot so I don't close it unless it's cooled some. It's nice that you can wear it while you move around without it falling off. I think it's better than anything else I have. Haven't tried it as a cold pack because I already have some very good alternatives. I would recommend it. It's better than a neck buddy that smells like an old sock. There's no odor with this one!"

I prefer the plant-based DHA supplements because they're never fishy, but I decided to give this one a shot based on its reviews.Unfortunately, this product did not deliver. I'm sure they're great for my developing baby, but they do cause nasty fish burps. If I take one in the middle of a meal--eat a little, then take the capsule, then eat some more--this effect is lessened and sometimes doesn't even occur. But if I take them before or after, I get the fish burps. The taste is really awful, like stale salmon.I'll finish this bottle now that I've learned how to reduce the yucky effect, but I won't buy them again.

After about 3 days the metal clips that hold the straps in place break and bend (cheap metal). I repaired them and after about another week the straps tore and I was unable to keep the brace tight. I would recommend this only if you needed it for a week.

And by all means do not kneel on the arm support under the head rest as i did acidentily as the tigs that hold it on will snap like dry spagetti. LOl The product was very adiquait and well put together other than the arm rest which I have not fortified and it holds nicely. Weight and portability are good so a thumbs up from me!

Overall the construction seems to be of decent quality, so no complaints there!The holster itself gets the job done in that it does hold shears, I was using it on my duty belt as I cant stand having shears in my side pocket. The only useful position I found, was in the center/lumbar area of my belt. I never lost a pair of shears, but god bless anyone who can get a pen to stay in this thing! The velcro enclosure has a tendency to catch on just about everything you dont want it to (oxygen tubing, iv drip sets, all the crap people keep in their halls when youre using a stairchair at 3am....)

36578,0,"I purchased this product primarily for bikini shaving. The additional attachments are certainly useful, however. In fact, I've found the other attachments usually work better than the shaving head. The blades on the trimmers do seem to be prone to jamming, however.GENERAL:Some general comments I have about the 5-In-1 follow.*PROS*---Convenient to have multiple features in one unit rather than having to purchase different units for each task.---Rechargeable so saves on batteries.---Can be used wet or dry. (Though I found it very ineffective wet, it is still nice to be able to rinse it out.)---Comfortable shape and size.*CONS*---It seems to require constant charging, running down quickly after just a few shaves. This is a major problem for traveling out of the U.S. since it does not have dual voltage.---There is no indicator light to tell when it is fully charged, just one that says it is charging.---You also cannot use it while plugged in, which prevents you from simply plugging it into an adaptor to use it overseas.---There is no stand; all the attachments and cord are supposed to be kept in a zippered bag. Though this may be nice for traveling, it makes charging it a pain as it can easily slide off a surface onto the floor from the cord weight alone.---The bag also is cluttered with everything in it and I am concerned about the attachments becoming damaged as a result of everything getting knocked around together.SHAVING HEAD:All in all, I'm rather disappointed with the shaving head. Some comments I have about this attachment are listed below:*PROS*---Nice size for an all over bikini shave.---Non-iritating; it does not cause bumps as often as razors seem to do.---No trimmer combs around the cutting screen so there is nothing to catch on sensitive skin in the curves the way the larger electric shavers often do.---Seems to be the only one of it's type on the market.*CONS*---This attachment does not seem to be very well made; I had to use nail glue to keep the screen from falling out.---The blades also seemed to have dulled very quickly though I have only used mine for a little over a month.---There are no replacement parts available for replacing the cutters. You have to service the whole unit apparently.---It requires going over an area repeatedly for it to be effective. A dual-screen head would probably be more efficient.---The screen and blades do not lift and cut consistently, requiring the use of the other attachments to try and touch up hairs it will not cut.---It requires frequent cleaning and oiling, even when not using it wet (it cuts *VERY* poorly wet). I personally have to clean it multiple times during a single shave for even for the shortest stubble.---Makes some rather disturbing grinding sounds that aren't present with the other attachments.Though I use the 5-in-One daily and much prefer it to a standard razor, I am still looking for a unit that better suits my needs."

134293,0,"This Waterpik Ultra Water Jet replaces a WJ7B Conair Interplak Water Jet.The Conair lasted two years, I replaced it with the same model, and the new one lasted only a week. I liked the old Conair (that's why I re-ordered it) because it had a low price, a very strong pulse, extra jets (my spouse used it also and they can break), and a reasonably small footprint. Although the new one was the same model number, it failed in one week for the same reason that the old one did after two years -- the pump tried to push water but couldn't, at all. Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money and I ordered the Waterpik Ultra.The Waterpik Ultra has about the same footprint as the Conair. I didn't like that the price was almost double of the Conair, it came with only two jets, and the pulse wasn't as strong as the Conair. Nevertheless, I liked it because it works despite the lower pressure and it is more quiet (the Conair vibrated and rattled a lot on the bathrooom vanity).Unfortunately, the first Waterpik Ultra I ordered lasted less than a week. Like the new Conair, it made a loud humming noise but couldn't pump any water. Fortunately, Amazon replaced it without any fuss (I am very impressed with Amazon's refund/replacement policy that includes free return shipping using their label). The replacement arrived more quickly than Amazon's original shipment, which I think is nice because I was stuck without a Waterpik while I waited for the new one. The replacement has worked a few weeks as of this review. I hope this one lasts a few years. If not for the first Waterpick that I had to replace, I would have given this product 4-1/2 stars.By the way, I also recently purchased from Amazon a Panasonic EW1270AC portable water irrigator for traveling. (I also bought one about a year ago for my daughter for use at college.) Although the Panasonic is not as effective as the Waterpik for regular use, which I would not expect of a battery-operated product, it is pretty good for the intended purpose.UPDATE 6/2009: The button on the handle to stop water temporarily doesn't allow water to flow when released. I simply don't use it but this is dissapointing."

The vibration is good, as far as the batteries are concerned, have some extra or rechargeable ones on hand. Not a good First time toy, too big in my personal opinion. One major problem with this toy is that it has a seam, which is PAINFUL! Although an easy solution is to put a condom over it. If you were to buy this toy, you would probably need to mark the control to know which way the g-spot massager is, otherwise you may feel some discomfort when the toy isn't on you g-spot."
408508,0,"Purchased as a replacement for Norelco's supposedly high-end Smarttouch XL 9190XL, which did not shave closely enough for my tastes. The Braun is much heavier and as loud as an electric lawnmower. While the self-cleaning unit gets the job done it is large and bulky, too big to store on a bathroom countertop of limited size. The unit is not well-suited for travel. With the lower weight limits for checked baggage on all the airlines these days, ounces count when packing for a long trip and this model just weighs too much. Packing the cleaning unit for travel would be out of the question. The shaving closeness is only marginally better than the Norelco. I'm still searching for the holy Grail of electric razors."

I am ready to move on and find a better epilator.Below are a few pros and consPros:1) Wet/Dry - The wet feature is very helpful as it keeps pain level down. and makes cleaning the product quick and easy.2)Cordless - Don't need to sit next to an outlet, a big plus (but could also be a con, see below)Cons:1) Does not capture all hair, I need to go over the same area several times to remove all hair.2) Cordless - Battery doesn't last too long, and if I forget to recharge it, it won't be ready for me to use whenever I want to"
376604,0,I was a ped nurse not too long before i became a mom and it is not recommened that you use these thermometers on infants. But I must say that the ear thermometers used in the hospital seemed a lot more accurate that this particular one. It is all abt technique and even someone like me still has trouble with it. My husband and I used it one ourselves and got temperatures off by a degree with several reads! It is probably more user error than a fault in the thermometer. I still think a rectal temperature is the most accurate on an infant.

I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me. The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose. Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer. Give it try, it might work for you."

47038,0,"I wish I could leave a 5 star review, as I am generally an avocate for natural products, but this just doesn't cut the mustard, literally. I find that even if I wash the dishes completely before cycling them, they come out with a dull film that looks worse than before. I'm sure they are ""clean"" but I wouldn't want to serve my dishes to company like that. My compromise is to use Cascade to brighten everything up if I'm having guests. It does smell great, but that doesn't lift my mood as much as re-washing dishes brings it down! All the other Mrs. Meyers products I have tried have been great. I just wouldn't recomend this to anyone with lots of minerals in their water."

I had recent hip surgery and it has worked okay for the most part, but again, the lid size has made some situations very difficult. Beware if size is a consideration."
244658,0,"I used a Braun shaver for two years. It did a much better job than any Norelco I had used previously. I really enjoyed shaving with Braun. However, the weak spot of this shaver was the battery. It developed a ""memory"" despite the fact that I periodically discharged it completely in accordance with Braun's instructions. So as time went on, I had to recharge the battery more often. It finally died after two years of use. The battery is not replaceable so when it goes, so does the razor. Additionally, Braun recommends replacing the cutter and foil every 18 months. I did the math and decided the cost was too much, so rather than purchasing another one, I switched back to a regular razor."
309177,0,"It's a little confusing to use this product at first, and takes a few uses before it starts to make sense and you figure out what works for you. Unlike a hot/cold pack it doesn't generate an instant feeling of comfort and relief, but I can feel the knots coming undone in my shoulder. I gather it's one of those products that works better the more you use it."
296562,0,It is good I think because they send me the same batteries but does not look like the image. It is in a smaller paper cover.

I might as well keep it then.
428105,0,It took almost 3 weeks to recieve the two pairs of stockings I ordered and when they arrived they were not in a box nor did they have any tags on them so I am not certain they are actually Jobst brand stockings.

86165,0,"This product doesn't always seem to work for me. I could notice body odor on myself, and my significant other even mentioned to me that I smelled--and not in a good way. (I hope my coworkers didn't notice, but I suspect they did, too.) I've been using it for about a month, and I believe some days are better than others, but I still feel worried when I wear this, especially if I'm doing any activity where I'll sweat a lot.When this product was nearly depleted, I boughtKiss My Face Scented Active Enzyme Stick Deodorant, 2.48-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 6), which is ostensibly a stick version of this deodorant (although scented--I figured that could at least be a backup if the deodorant fails again). However, the ingredients and mechanism are actually quite different: the main ingredient in the stick is some sort of ""natural vegetable enzyme,"" although it contains corn starch and ""clay"" (presumably the ingredient listed as kaolin); the liquid version here is primarily potassium alum (an antiseptic, which should really work but just doesn't seem to for me), although there are other ingredients. In any case, the two are quite different products, and I find that the stick works better. (For the record, I also like the stick by Tom's, which is the only other natural deodorant I've tried so far.)There are other disadvantages to this liquid, as well: the solvent is water, which can take a long time to dry. (I know alcohol dries out some people's skin, but that's not a problem for me.) I practically have to walk around for a couple minutes with my arms in the air or blow into my underarms to speed evaporation, either of which is potentially embarrassing in a locker room.However, I appreciate the intent behind this product: a more ""natural"" deodorant, no added scents (although I wonder if the scented version might seem to work better), and a recyclable bottle. Unfortunately, three stars is the best I can give this due to its lack of consistent effectiveness. In the future, I will continue to opt for the stick, but keep in mind that different products might work better for different people--plenty of people use potassium alum-based deodorants with good luck, but I must not be one of them."

I could not find a replacement battery, so I bought the current Wahl Groomsman trimmer. I found it to be much too loud, and not as comfortable to use, so I returned it. I then removed the battery from my old trimmer. A day later I replaced it, and found it would now take a charge. So I will continue to use my old Wahl trimmer. In my experience the new Wahl trimmers are not as good as the older ones."
403233,1,"Xylitol is the best sweetener I've ever used . . . period. Jarrow's price for the 16-ounce jug here at Amazon isn't too bad, either. I've also used the powder mixed with Lactoferrin and alcohol-free Witch Hazel as a wound dressing to stop bacteria from colonizing, which produce toxins that create infections and slowdown wound healing. I first learned of this a couple of years ago after reading about such being used in wound care centers. I will definitely continue to buy the product, as I use it everyday as a sweetener. Highly recommended."
327179,2,"Perhaps my expectations were much higher than what I got. To me this is nothing but an expensive, glorified light show, it works ok as a hand warmer, but it's very hard to use on other areas such as the neck, the back or even the knees, because of is shape. Although it does work ok on big muscle areas, as long as you can hold it with your hands... and it's not warm enough for some areas of the body either. I'm disappointed that I bought into the hype."
217404,0,"The tobacco scent, to my nose, is the domineering smell of this scent. I personally like the smell of tobacco, but I do wish this cologne had a bit more subtlety and more layers. I wear this sometimes, but I wouldn't rush to buy it again when it's done. It's not as complex a scent as I usually like, and while it smells best after it's settled, to me the scent doesn't ""evolve"" in the way others do after applying them. As a result, the notes of tobacco are a bit much for my personal taste. I also don't find this to be a memorable scent, which I like in a cologne."
268591,0,"I hated researching for a baby thermometer, spent way too much time on Amazon since all of them have some negative reviews and their is no clear winner. Went with this one anyway. I can say that when it works it is easy to use and precise, in that I got very repeatable measurements going the rectal route (cannot comment on accuracy because I did not compare it to a NIST standard). It is easy to use with a screaming wiggling baby and the beeping lets you know you have your measurement, and that measurement is locked on the display until you turn it off. That is all great.The reason I give this 3 stars is that after two uses the LCD screen filled up with moisture and became unreadable. This was after gently cleaning with soap and water as stated in the instructions. It is a very poor design that water can get in the LCD screen, I mean this is something you stick up your childs rectum, of course it is going to see a little moisture, and I was even being careful having read about this problem in other reviews. Just one simple O-Ring seal and this thermometer would be 5 stars and be the clear Amazon favorite.Amazon is sending me another, which is great, and meanwhile 12 hours later the LCD screen seems to be drying out enough to function. Perhaps I can update this to 4 stars if it salvages itself."

257953,0,"On paper, this floor cleaner sounds like a great idea. I think it does only an okay job. I like the idea of the Hoover extracting the dirty water off the floor, but it really needs a wash mode where it's not immediately sucking up cleaning solution up while I'm trying to scrub the floor. It doesn't provide enough time for it to work the dirt off and it wastes a LOT of solution. Obviously, you would have to use discretion as this might not be a good idea on wood, but for tile, it would be fine. I think the floor would get much cleaner if I had a handled brush and a bucket of cleaner to scrub the tile and then use the Floormate with clean water in its tank to suck the dirty solution up.The H3010 is advertised here at Amazon to come with 2 brush blocks (normal and grout) but mine only came with the regular brush block. When I received the unit, the box didn't state anywhere that it should come with 2 so I think I got taken. I contacted Amazon to see if they will correct this problem. Until then, if you purchase this item, be warned that you may not get the second brush block advertised to be included. I really wanted the grout brush block because the normal one just isn't aggressive enough to get that deep down dirt in the crevices.Construction wise, the unit seems to have a good fit and finish even if almost everything is made of plastic. The noise level the machine puts out isn't as bad as I had feared it could be. It sounds like a vacuum cleaner with a bunch of little brushes swishing around! The canisters pop in and out easily and cleanup was quick and painless. Probably 5 minutes to tear it down, rinse it out and have it drying on the dishrack.So, it's not the silver bullet to floor cleaning. Maybe in 2 or 3 more iterations of the Floormate, but not this one and not in the new H3060. The scrubbing brushes need to be height adjustable, and there should be a switch to turn off the suction while scrubbing. I checked the manual for the H3060 and the wash mode still retains the vacuum pickup just like the H3010."

Shaver head is not comfortable as it shaves -- seems to be like trying to put a square peg into a round hole -- it doesn't want to follow the contours of the face.

389616,0,"I find Go-Mixes to be very satisfying for only 200 calories. First, they take longer to eat than most energy bars, which I like - who wants to be done in just four bites? Also, the balanced mix of protein, carbs, and fat tide me over for quite a while. These snacks even handle warm weather well - the yogurt raisins melt a bit but not a problem.The ""chocolate nut crunch"" and ""toffee crunch"" are outstanding - a sweet and salty combination. The ""berry"" blend isn't bad but has more of a ""healthy"" taste - the soy nut flavor take over.I'm concerned that they are discontinuing this product. That would be a shame."

I have to do one floor at a time, so the container is *always* wet from the previous floor and the sludge is gross.Any time you have to empty it, you need to rinse it and chances are it the top needs a rinse as well. Even removing the filter doesn't keep it dry and the filter gets moldy real fast.Sure, I use it 'cause it works, but everytime I do I shake my head and wonder whether the engineers who designed it ever even used it, or if they were put under pressure to cut corners to meet a deadline or price."

330384,0,"My first impression of the razor was that it was overly packaged. In a day and age in which we're becoming aware of environmental hazards, I don't think there's a need for an outer box enclosing a couple layers of thick hard-to-open plastic wrapping. A strong pair of scissors cut through the lot, and eventually I got to the razor itself.I was pleased to see that it comes with a hard-shell case for travel. This is definitely a good thing to have, though I would have preferred it were only one piece that swivels open and shut, rather than two pieces that have to be separated to open it.The instructions indicate that the charging pod should be unplugged when the razor is fully charged (which takes about an hour). While hardly the worst thing in the world, I don't see why they couldn't have designed it so that it could remain plugged it but turned off. In general, I prefer not to have plugs lying around exposed, especially in the bathroom, where I think most people would tend to keep it. It does have a very clear indicator, though, telling how much longer it needs to charge before reaching the full 65 minutes, and, after a couple weeks of usage, it still did not need to be recharged, so it definitely holds the charge well.The razor itself is stylish and comfortable to hold, and it has a trimmer on the back, which is good for sideburns and the awkward just-under-the-nostrils area.My first shave felt like it took ages, and, half-way through, I seriously considered giving up and getting out my old blade and shaving cream. I decided to stick with it, and, eventually, I figured out that you can't just press it to your face, but press it rather firmly. With more pressure, it eventually got the job done. Subsequent shaves went much easier, and as I got used to using the shaver, the shave-time got less and less. It does a significantly better and faster job on only one day's growth rather than two or three, so it's much more ideal for everyday use than if you tend to go a few days between shaves.Clean-up is easy and fast. Just flip the three razor bits up and rinse with hot water. I'm a little suspicous about using water to clean it each day - I would tend to think it'll rust - but time will tell.After shaving, my face sometimes feels less comfortable than had I used a regular blade and shaving cream, but usually it feels all right. This is the third electric shaver I've owned, and it has been the case with all three that the shave is not as close as even the worst blade I've used. There's really no getting around it: you'll always get a closer shave using a real blade. I'd say this is easily the best of the three electric razors I've used, though, and did a significantly better job on the chin, due to its swiveling head.Overall, I find myself liking this shaver, particularly for the traveling and the cold winter months, when I don't really want to deal with a wet shave in the morning."

29723,0,"Let me first say that the Lansinoh disposables are better on pretty much all measures, except for environmental friendliness and cost.That being said, I switched to these reusables after about 3 months, when I was noticing that my disposable pads were almost always dry but I was unwilling to go without anything. At that point, it seemed like I couldn't justify the waste or cost of the disposables anymore.These don't stay in place as well as the disposables, which have a sticky background (for reference, I wear Bravado Basics bras and tanks from Target; they work better with the ones that are mostly cotton and slide around more with the ones that are mostly nylon). Since I'm still nursing often, I usually notice and readjust when I feed my daughter, and I also check when I get a private moment. The Lansinoh stayed in place, except during pumping when I would somehow leak out the bottom.Although they come with a laundry bag, I find it easier to handwash them in soapy water, squeeze them out, and roll them in a towel to get out extra moisture. Afterwards, they are almost dry and I set them out to finish air drying. I am able to rotate three pairs, wearing one a day.In short, I would definitely use the disposables through the engorgement phase. Afterwards, these might be a good choice, but I would still keep some disposables around for situations in which you really, really don't want to risk a leak."

114898,1,"This low-cost pad has enhanced the lives of two elderly people whom I know, and has played an important part in reversing Stage 1 pressures sores for both of them. I hope it can help you avoid pressure sores in the first place. This pad has also reduced the discomfort of one person whose spine is now deformed. Here are some details.I ordered the first of two pads for my dad, who has a bad heart. He spends a lot of time in a recliner and started to develop a Stage 1 pressure sore on his tailbone. He is now using this pad in his recliner and has trained himself to shift positions 4x per hour. This has healed the Stage 1 pressure sore on his tailbone.On Sunday mornings I sit with the mother of a friend of mine whose spine is severely degenerated. She is no longer able to lie down because of an extreme spinal curvature, and as a result spends her days and nights in a recliner. I got her one of these pads and she uses it differently than my dad uses it. She is a very tiny woman (about 4'6"") and so she sits on the thin side of the pad and leans on the thick side of the pad. We have customized the pad by cutting out two holes in the thick side. One hole is a long oval that goes through both layers of the thick side. This accommodates the protruding part of her spine, which had a Stage 1 pressure sore on it that is now entirely healed. We also cut a much smaller oval through the eggcrate layer only to accommodate her tailbone. Her tailbone had previously had a Stage 2 pressure sore that had already been healed to Stage 1 before we got the pad. Now that she uses the pad with the hole cut through the eggcrate layer of the thick side, the Stage 1 sore on the tailbone has also healed. This customized pad has also had a second benefit. Leaning back on her degenerated spine caused this lady a terrific amount of pain and discomfort. The use of the customized pad has changed this entirely. With the customized pad she is able to lean back in much less discomfort, which in turn allows her to sleep better. In addition to the customized pad, she uses a pellet-filled neck pillow that supports her head and neck in a healthy position.I am now ordering a third pad so that the lady with the spinal curvature can have a back-up. She just had a heart attack and is in the hospital recovering nicely. Her daughter (my friend) is ready for a back-up pad because she has had to take the original pad to the hospital.I hope these detailed descriptions can help you decide if this pad can help you or someone you know as much as it has helped my dad and the lady I sit with."

While I do believe it helps me fall asleep, it does not help me stay asleep. I still wake up after just a few hours. Though, unlike some sleep aids, it does not leave me feeling groggy."

159052,2,"I bought this item for doing haircuts, but unfortunately it is completely useless for this: Hair gets stuck in the machine, and the engine is too weak."
98293,2,"The idea of a roll-on hot wax applicator is really great, especially the convenience of heating the wax by simply plugging it in. The lousy thing is, the wax gets kinda sticky and clumpy instead of hot and runny, ready to spread on the stubble and top with the strip before cool and rip ALL the hair out with a heartfelt holler, the way hot waxing should be. This is more like that washable wax or gel stuff, you might like it it if that worked for you."

353704,0,"Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.Pros:+Healthy+Unique tasteCons:-Unique tasteOverall three stars. Remember that three stars means it just okay, I am not hammering this product as I am sure some people will very much so enjoy it. If you are taking it for health purposes than I am sure you won't mind the taste at all as it is great tasting for medicine."
165862,1,I have been waxing my legs for 3 years and decided to try something new. I bought this and i LOVE it!! i have had no pain or irritation and it's less expensive in the long run! I have followed the tips given by others and they've worked! some areas are hard to get but i just go over them after a couple hours or the next day. i love it.
336731,0,"Emjoi AP-10L Light Caress, CordedI have used the Emjoi AP99 Optima for years. The last time I ordered a hair remover I purchased the AP-10L. I was very disappointed in it compared to the AP99 Optima by Emjoi. The AP-10L does not remove hair from legs or underarms nearly as well as it should in my opinion."
76412,0,"Sorry folks, I read all of the positive reviews and this seemed like a dream (literally). My husband wakes up very early and often wakes me up (and I can't fall back asleep because I start hearing all the creepy sounds in an empty house). But, I found it to be extremely loud (my husband put a pillow over his head), even after closing down the vents (to muffle it). So loud that I can't imagine falling asleep in it's presence. I also thought it wasn't a very ""relaxing"" sound. I returned it and pulled out my old oscillating fan and put it by my bedside pointed away from me. I keep it on ""high"" and it has been amazing. Very relaxing, breezy summer afternoon type sound (even in the winter). I wish I had thought of it sooner, I'm not waking up anymore when my husband leaves."

180414,0,"I bought this product because I read that it was a very effective sleep aid. While it does help me sleep better, I wasn't warned about the smell of it. This tea has a very strong earthy odor and everyone around me complains of the stink when I drink it. I personally have a very poor sense of smell so I can tolerate it. I think this should be part of the product description."
371456,0,"I received two different guard sets mixed into a single package. Both bore Wahl logos, but only one of the two worked for my Wahl clippers. As my clippers may be 40 years or older (they belonged to my grandfather) I wasn't expecting to find anything that would fit them, but it seems that Wahl design hasn't changed much over the years. 3 stars for 5 usable guards that fit my very old, but well-working Wahl clippers."

35823,0,"Duro-Med Soft Foam Cervical Collar 2-1/2 Width, White, LargeMy neck was irritated by this collar. I solved my problem by cutting off a piece of the toe of a white cotton sock, and sliding it over the collar. It also helped to rub some A&D; ointment on my neck between the collar and my skin. It also was very uncomfortable sleeping with the collar on, OK to use when on the computer or reading a book."

53247,0,"We really like these soniccare products, but replaced the first one because it quit working after 4 years, whic isn't too bad.We were disappointed with this one because it didn't have the divided timer option: Our first one would beep every quarter of the run time so you could gauge how much time to spend in each section of your mouth.We replaced it after a few years because we had trouble finding replacement heads.Our new one is great (it has the smaller heads) and the timer beeps every quarter plus it has an option to run/brush longer."
384856,0,"I just finished taking this along with the Blessed Thistle and it did nothing for me. All 100 pills, nothing. I guess everyting doesn't work for everybody.

60732,0,"Purchased this in an effort to give some relief to my 3 month old baby girl, but somehow it seemed like she cried harder when I used it on her. I was careful to follow all the directions as it was a microwaveable product, but no luck. My advice would be to give it a try, as not everything works for every baby, but keep the packaging handy in case of any returns. Gave it 3 stars because it was a good concept, but didn't work for my baby."

357768,0,I bought this hoping to get fast reading since most arm units are designed for a doctor or nurse to use. Don't know why anyone can't design a full arm unit for single person use. Don't hold your breath using this one. You will turn blue before this thing allows it to work. All systems have to be perfect or this dumb thing does nothing. I am returning it because the VA is providing me in home tele-monitoring and I don't want to wait all day for this thing to decide to give me my blood pressure.The worst feature is the lame thick book of instructions that just keep repeating everything until it drives you crazy. It is written for a five year old or maybe was written by a five year old. Really stupid in either case. It's over designed and overpriced.
247927,0,Not really impressed with this trimmer. Have to do alot of passes over same spots and it has trouble with leg hair. Very good on sensitive areas though...
118906,0,"What I do like about this thermometer is that it seems to take fast, accurate oral readings. fast is crucial since young children often like to fidget.Where the unit has significant problems is in its functions and poorly written instructions. Unlike most other thermometers, this one can't be switched to take reading in Centigrade. Also, although the mechanism for the termometer folding and storing inside of itself is a novel idea, the unit is not constructed well enough so that you end up bending the tip when it is inserted for storage and constantly worrying whether it will break or not.I would give this thermometer a miss and stick with one of the others available on Amazon."
117314,0,"I just gave a review for the orange ""oil eater"", was told by a friend that it removes water spots off of windows,(I wasn't sure which oil eater the friend was talking about, so I purchased both) it does not..its an ok cleaner, but too expensive for what it does.We did use it in a capet shampooer, and it worked ok, so guess for the price of carpet shampoo, and diluted as told, it works good. Its a good cleaner, just too expensive, 409 works as well.(although I don't use 409 in my carpet shampooer.)"
373168,0,"I really do love Tiger Balm, it's awesome on aches in the muscle and pains that are too deep for regular icy hot et al.Unfortunately, this product is a super thin version similar to the consistency of rubbing alcohol (which DOES penetrate really quickly and well) BUT it is difficult to keep to one location and there's no real good application process. I thought it would have the small spongy applicator on top like Absorbene Jr. used to have but it's just a hole in the top of the glass bottle. I tried tissues, cotton balls and a couple other things that didn't work so now I just use my hand to apply it.I will totally back up that it does work really well, but this version of Tiger Balm is a real mess to use. I think I'll try to find a creamier version next time."
14997,0,"The recommended dosage for this supplement is 3Xs daily. When I tried to do that, the result was pretty severe stomach upset. I have found that I can only take 1 a day.

178162,0,"While I think that this is a great tool to have, I think that it could be so much better. I'd pay a couple extra bucks for a bit more functionality - maybe a way to keep a history and/or upload this information to your computer. Also, I don't know how many times I've forgotten to reset the time until 15 minutes after I've fed the baby. It'd be nice to let me add minutes to the timer.I'd like to see Coast Innovations get together with Belkin and get some Wemo technology in this thing. I feel like if Belkin can give me basically a cloud device for $50 that will connect to my network and gives me the ability to send information to it - then this thing could be $50 and provide similar functionality. A computer could query the device periodically and download a history of what's going on, as well as keep the clock correct (I hate that we still have to set clocks).I had to purchase 2 of these. We didn't realize that the first one came broken (the back-light didn't work) until we got the second one and the back-light did work. The first one broke after dropping it, once, on the hardwood floors. The timers stopped working and we couldn't reset the clock.Decent device. Could be much better with existing technology."

257446,0,"I bught this pill case because of the size, it's not too big. And it is a cute design. It really doesn't hold your pills securely though. The outside lock can slide to open easily.

258665,0,"I am really into tweezing my eyebrows. I'll spend far too long trying to pull out one hair. So I really hoped these would lessen my frustration at getting out certain challenging hairs. Unfortunately, my roommate's cheaper Earth Therapeutics tweezers are still the ones I end up relying on when the Tweezerman can't do the job. For the most part they are just fine, but they certainly aren't the miracle they are purported to be (for me at least). I am definitely buying my own Earth Therapeutics, which means I'll own 3 tweezers! Yikes!"
37331,0,"It's fine, the first one I've ever had, so I don't know how to review it. My friend who recommended epilators to me has used them for 15 years tried it, and she's buying one. Most of the attachments didn't seem to make much difference, but my hair is very thin and not hard to pull out.It has two attachments meant to help with the epilator's contact with the skin and efficiency. Another attachment functions as a shaver (for touch up?) and trimmer for cutting longer hair down to optimal length for epilating. That attachment is handy for any shaving and trimming needed, so the tool is more versatile."

312406,1,"The customer service side of my purchase was great. The product itself works, however, it definitely takes a while getting used to. I bought it to save money in the long run and also because I swim and do all sorts of outdoor activities which made me think it would be more convenient. You do have to empty it less frequently than anything else (pad/tampon). At first, due to inexperience, it is messy and quite uncomfortable to change in public places. You do spend more time in the stall with inexperience and it's not ideal to wash in public places (especially since I am mostly on campus where restrooms are never empty). At first I wanted to give up on it but now after about my second cycle I love it! With familiarity and practice, it becomes fairly fast and easy. It's definitely worth sticking with. My best advise for beginning users is to remain relaxed and not tense up :) this really makes a difference and will reduce the pain in removing the cup (However I should state that the pain does subside rather quickly and you will eventually grow accustomed to the feel which won't matter much). Like I said, it's not that bad of a product and does deserve a chance, as it is eco-friendly and all."
385688,0,I really don't get how this deodorant is supposed to work. It does not do anything in my opinion. I rub it but its stiff... there's no odor. Maybe I'm doing something wrong... I'll wait and see...
183218,0,"Well, my Tweezerman brush busted after 11 months... the brush/bristles separated from the handle. It was never dropped, and always hung with the bristles down to dry. When it was in working order, I loved it. I used it to make lather with the C.O. Bigelow cream in a ceramic cappuccino mug. It was great. It was my first brush (I also bought my first DE razor with this brush), so I have nothing to compare it to, but when I used it, it was wonderful.It held water (and heat) and lather really well. Good stiffness, and minimal shedding (shedding stopped after first five-ish shaves). So, overall, I am pleased with this brush's performance, but not pleased with its longevity and lifespan. Though, I suppose you get what you pay for. I would order it again, but I figured, why keep spending the $20 when I could buy a $40 badger brush which will hopefully last much longer."

55107,1,We have over 20 AA batteries that are used in our wireless mic's at church. This charger does a much better job of fully charging the batteries.

We were using those units but it did not fully charge the batteries.

65821,0,"We bought these because we LOVE Tranquility's ""All Through the Night"" Adult Diapers, and we were hoping that these pull-on ""Overnight"" diapers from the same company would be equivalent and easier to use. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. Over the past 3 nights, the only way I find I can keep the bed dry underneath my small, elderly mother when using these is to put a substantial overnight pad inside them AND a diaper (Depends) over it. Even then, the quilted, waterproof bed pad was damp and needed to be laundered! So, apparently, these pull-on diapers are really not meant to go ""All Through the Night"" like the diapers they make with tabbed sides. (I will go back to using them.) I still give 3 stars, however, because they really protected Mom's skin from urine all through the night - and she finds them very comfortable to wear. I can recommend them, therefore, for those who are incontinent during the day."

317752,0,"The Norelco 8140XL is the best that you are going to get from an electric shaver. I tried a Remington foil shaver and it was horrible. It did a poor job of shaving, was VERY loud and made a mess of my bathroom when I cleaned it.I returned it and bought the 8160XL because it was the same price as the 8140XL on Amazon. The Jet Clean system is a waste of time and space. You clean the cutting blades by opening the top and holding it under running water - done! I don't see any reason to use the cleaning system.If you can't use a multi-blade razor and need to go electric then I recommend the Norelco 8140XL.My rating system:*****(5 stars) - Good old multi-blade razor and shave cream (my old skin can't take blades anymore)****(4 stars) - Norelco 8140XL***(3 stars) - Norelco 8160XL* (1 star) - Remington foil type shaver"

329442,1,"First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else. But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims. I ordered Pumpkin Pie, and I was instantly impressed. Some flavored lip balms don't taste exactly like their flavor, or taste &#34;processed&#34; or &#34;fake.&#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it's flavor. I'm very impressed.My shipment came on time. The receipt had a little &#34;thank you&#34; and smiley face on it (which was very cute). The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it (great presentation). The balm goes on super smoothly and doesn't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex, but I'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too! I will be ordering another one when this runs out."

I contacted the seller and they insisted that this is for 16 blades total (as they said 2 packs of 8 blades) and that they never had this type of problems before. Very disappointing, I shopped with amazon.com and when it says 2 pack is double the amount listed."
158836,0,"The vacuum feature of the trimer is fantastic compared to the older models which shot trimmings out all over the sink area.The only draw backs are no travel pouch is included and no specialty mini trimmer included with the T780.Great trimmer for trimming large areas or large amounts of hair i.e, winter to summer beard.Too large to get in to smaller areas or to use to do detailed trimmingRecommend the T980 which comes with the Mini trimmer and travel pouch if you can afford it."

122623,0,"I purchased this product and have decided to return it. Although it is very convenient, especially for people who travel frequently as I do, I found the blue light too harsh for my eyes. After speaking with my doctor, I learned that some people with light colored eyes or who generally are a bit sensitive to light may have trouble with the LED blue light in this product. I am going to go back to a traditional 10,000 LUX light. Even then, the products on the market range from very white light to softer colored, more yellow light, all of which can deliver the necessary 10,000 lux. Apollo products are high quality, but very white, and hence too harsh for me. My advice -- do your homework, talk with representatives from several companies, and if possible, visit a store so you can see before you buy how your eyes react to a particular type of light!"
378495,0,"At first I carried the tub into the nursery to bathe my son and it worked great for a while, but the first time I tried to carry it to the bathroom (rather than my husband) to empty it out it leaked all over and I had a mess to clean. Since then I have used it in the bathtub (with a bad back this is difficult). My son is only 3 months old and already he is getting almost too long to use it (of course he is a rather large 3-month old). For the time being he is doing OK in it, he likes to splash around. I think when he get old enough to just lay down in it I will have to invest in a new tub. The sitting position might be good, but it will definitely need a non-skid seat (which I'll have to add on)."

I rubbed my hands half to death and when I put it on my arms and legs my husband was questioning me if the shea had an expiration date on it. I even had him rubbing the product into my skin until it was red. Not now shea butter ever again. I even placed the shea butter in my microwave thinking it would melt. I tried the refrigerator thinking it would be better at melting once it was placed into my palm, that was a joke! It is currently in the bottom of my refrigerater until hell freezes over."

After walmart axed carrying the du-more bios (which were awesome) this is what I'm stuck with. Luckily, I usually buy them cheap enough that I don't care about the failure rate.Actually if you're able to find them the ""plackers"" brand is very good as well."

In my opinion the new Smart Touch line that uses the HQ9 heads is not worth the upgrade. I buy new heads once a year, which makes my older shaver feel like new. The only real reason to upgrade a Quadra/HQ7 Norelco is if the batteries are failing--and there are numerous places now where you can have your dying batteries replaced.Don't fall for ""the latest is always better"" line."

I've only had it since today so I don't know what it's longevity will be, but I've owned Phillips products in the past and found them to last a long time.

408339,0,"The Supersmile Whitening System does its job of lightening tooth color, although you're never going to get those shining white celebrity teeth without veneers. Nonetheless, I found Supersmile easy to use and effective on achieving several shades of tooth lightening. It worked quicker than competing products, and, at the price, it should. Supersmile is still much cheaper than dental office whitening and achieves the same time limited effect.I initially ordered the starter system. It was effective, so I then ordered the larger economy size for future use. Big mistake. The larger tubes use a thick plastic that makes it difficult to squeeze the last half of the toothpaste out of the tube, effectively wasting it.Brush your teeth twice a day, rinse after meals, and floss daily. Still the best way for your teeth to look good and stay healthy. If you've got some yellow, Supersmile is effective in lightening the color and reducing the amount of plaque.

The design of the product is pretty bad, there's no way to sit down with this on that's for sure. But if you take the actual vibrator out and wrap it in something you can get away with it. The range on the remote is great and even though there's only one setting, it's not bad. Overall: Whoever designed this is great with electronics (sometimes) and knows nothing about the female body..."
3327,2,"What amazon is showing is what it used to be and what my son used to like. Before it was very clear capsule w/ 5 other ingredients you can readily identify. (sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, water, vita C, and vita E. I used to order 1 bottle every 2 months for my son and he used to like simple seaweed flavor. Now it has modified corn starch, glycerin, high oleic sunflower oil, purified water, CARRAGEENAN, sorbitol, ascorbyl palmitate, tocopherols, natural flavor, sunflower lecithin, and caramel. Now it has stronger odor, smaller but thicker shell, and dark brown in color from its original clear orange color. My son won't touch this thing anymore. I guess they changed the formula to decrease the volume and lower the cost. Time to look for another brand."

335538,0,"The sword is good but one feature should be considered before purchasing. It is as follows:I suppose this adds to it's ""indestructibility"" but the sword is a little flexible. However, if your blade angle is in line with the angle of your cut, then there is no notice. You can only feel it when you hit something, or when you, e.g. twist your sword during a cut. I suppose that can be considered a positive thing, as it will give you feedback when you make a bad cut.I used it during a demonstration, and it was rather comfortable. The grip is (for lack of a better description that comes to mind) a the tiniest bit coarse, but it does nothing but improve grip.This is a good choice, if you don't mind the slight flexibility. I haven't tried it yet, but i would imagine, it would be good for sparring, too."

Some of the add-on parts have skimpy instructions, or none, as if the buyer is an old hand at mustaches and beards. Getting the needed pieces to fit together takes a bit of repetition. All this said, you get a lot for your money, and with repetition and a bit of skill you should end up with a good system. The price is really reasonable.Whenyou've managed to get going, beards can be easily and effectively trimmed, mustaches are easy care and the total effect is excellent. Just a little more understanding of the new,inexperinced faces would be a real help."
147690,0,"This stuff makes your hair feel thicker after using it and overall is a good product. I have been using it for about 6 months and have not seen any hair-loss prevention or any hair growth what so ever. It is very reasonably priced and does leave my hair feeling thicker and better looking than other shampoos i've tried. I do think it promotes your hair to produce more oils though, it is pretty potent. After about 12-14 hours my forehead and scalp seem more oily than in the past since using this product, but nothing terrible or alarming.The smell could be better. It doesn't necessarily smell bad, but it kinda smells like lemony dish soap or like dial hand soap--like some commercial bathroom product--But you gotta hand it to them, it smells pretty damn good for a product having Saw Palmetto berries in it--in case you were unaware, saw palmetto extract and berries smell like pure vomit and death...lol! Don't worry you can't smell the saw palmetto at all. It is not strong scented, you'll just have a light fragrance of some industrial lemon-like handsoap while washing your hair.For the price, it's definitely worth it to at least try."

146915,0,"I like this charger. It is inexpensive and does the job, but requires a rather knowledgeable user. If you are the typical user, I recommend you not buy this. However, if you know something about batteries, this is a pretty good bargain charger, and does C, D, and 9v cells.The V-1199 is a timed charger, `Fast Charger' on the packaging not withstanding. After 4 or 8 hours (there is a switch: NiCd or NiMH), the charger changes from full charge to trickle charge.Problem: the charging for AA and AAA cells are good, but the charging for C and D is woefully inadequate. You will have to leave these types of cells for an unknown number of hours at trickle charge to give them a full charge. The instructions do not list what the amps are for full charge or trickle, so there is no real way of telling how much longer to leave these type of cells. 9V are even worse: it trickle charges, and there is no timer; you just have to keep track of the hours.As a practical matter, I leave C, D, and 9v for a full 24 hours. Overcharging is not a problem since it trickles, so you can safely leave your cells for even longer without a problem.Technical data from instructions:NiCd (4 hours)AAA (240-300 mAh)AA (750-800 mAh)C (1400 mAh)D (1400 mAh)NiMH (8 hours)AAA (550-800 mAh)AA (1600-2300 mAh)C (2300-2800 mAh)D (2300-2800 mAh)D (5000 mAh) - 16 hours (2 cycles)9v.NiCd (110 mAh) 10 hoursNiMH (150-160 mAh) 15 hours"

The head is definitely larger which some people will not like because it is not as easy to maneuver inside the mouth. The jury is out on how well the bristles will hold up compared to the regular version which lasts me at least 4 months, I have a feeling it will not last quite as long because of the more intricate brush design. It was worth trying and I'm not disappointed but will probably be going back to the easier to maneuver regular version next time. I won't be going back to regular toothbrush's anytime soon after using the Oral-B Vitality brush with the various head refills."

68617,0,"My first experience with at-home waxing was with Gigi Brazilian Body Hard Wax, and it nearly made it my last. I am German-Irish; when it comes to the amount of hair on my legs and ""other"" body parts, I'm definitely more German, so I initially skipped doing any research and purchased the Hard Wax, assuming it would be best for someone with a lot of hair (and not as course as I thought). Wrong, wrong, wrong.I don't recall seeing anywhere that muslin strips were not to be used with this type of wax, so after leaving strip after strip of wax behind on my nether regions and ending up burning myself ""down there"" (on my legs, too) because of my ignorance, I finally sought advice on the internet to see what in the world I was doing wrong. Lo and behold, the Hard Wax is to be hand-pulled, NOT used with the strips. Even after getting the proper technique figured out, I couldn't help but think that the Hard Wax is either better suited for those with courser hair or those with more waxing experience than me. It was difficult to peel up the edge of it to rip it off and even after I DID get it off, there was still quite a bit of wax left behind. After over 2 hours of torture, tons of wasted muslin, and an enormous mess, I finally finished the job...sort of. I still had an inordinate amount of hair left (too much to tweeze it all)and 4 areas with bruised-looking burns.For someone like me, I found the Gigi General Purpose Honee Wax is far more effective and user-friendly. Perhaps the Hard Wax works well for others, but this was a ""hard"" lesson learned about following directions before embarking upon a new venture like this."
68181,0,I felt that this product was a good alternative for nutrition on the go. It would be nice to eat a fast bar when you're rushing out the door rather than skip an entire meal. The taste was acceptable. It wasn't like eating a candy bar but it wasn't terrible either. I haven't tried other nutritional bars so I really don't have anything to compare these to. I did feel that this was an interesting product and it definitely has its place in today's fast-paced world.

312341,0,"Fair warning- if you're easily TMI-ed (""too much information"") you may want to stop right here.As far as ""feminine hygiene"" products go, this type has pros and cons. I purchased the Diva Cup, which is basically identical to the Keeper. This product, like the Diva Cup, is relatively easy to clean, is much more eco-friendly than disposable products, and provides decent, if not perfect, protection against leaks. (I have heavy periods and don't get ""perfect"" protection from overnight pads worn for more than a few hours though... so I expect most women would find the Keeper more than sufficient in that area.) I would have continued to use this as one of my main products if not for one significant problem.It gets stuck.Yes, this happened more than once, and happened to the extent that I was not able to remove it on my own... one time my boyfriend was able to get it out (VERY awkward!) and the other time I had to go to the doctor to have it removed. Maybe it's just the way I'm built, but this thing traveled right up to my cervix while I was wearing it, and must have tried to keep going or something. And that little protrusion at the bottom is not as helpful as it looks. Trying to reach way up inside yourself and grab a tiny something you can't see is more likely than not going to lead you to accidentally pinch yourself in a tender area. (VERY uncomfortable!) Probably more than once.I'm all for being green, and if you can afford to try it's worth trying- everyone's built differently and I understand some women swear by the Keeper and have never had the problems I did. But for some women, like myself, the sea sponge-based methods are just as environmentally friendly, and considerably more comfortable and easier to remove. (I cannot overstress the easier to remove part enough.) True, you may need to replace the sponges once or twice a year (less if you use them infrequently) but you don't get much more biodegradable than a sea sponge."

If I wear it over one of those ACE compression sleeve braces it fits perfectly, so that's not really a giant issue. Just an annoyance. What is driving me insane though is the constant squeaking. It squeaks every single time I bend my knee, and we're not talking little squeaks. But considering it was half the price of my other braces, I don't know that I can complain that much. I only use this one for wearing around the house anyway on days my knee is acting up.Having said that, it gives decent support and it's pretty comfortable to wear even if it is larger than it should be for the size."

I bought another one with a thermostat of the same brand and it was wonderful...until it wasn't. It only lasted about a year also.

152564,2,"If I could give this product zero stars I would. Not only was this a complete waste of my money but the damage it has done to my hair is proving even more costly to fix (or attempt to!).Interested for some time in the whole Brazilian Karatin craze I saw an ad for the Organix line in a magazine and decided to order a kit off of Amazon. It came extremely fast and I got down to applying it exactly as directed. I even watched videos posted online including the official one by Organix. The main selling point for me was the ""natural"" aspect, frizz control benefits that were touted along with creating stronger hair. Having it pin straight was not something I was concerned about.After using this I am still at a loss as to what it is actually supposed to achieve. Using the flat iron to seal the treatment into my hair, my hair was not as straight as I could normally get it. It was left with no shine, felt brittle and was noticeably lighter in color. There was also a chemical smell to the product. After washing it from my hair I could instantly see the huge amount of damage, especially around the crown and sides, that had been done. Even worse my hair was left so porous and brittle that I couldn't use any heat on it at all and it took ages to dry. The texture was nothing that I had ever experienced on myself before. (for reference my hair is long, wavy, thick European hair).Weeks later and I'm still trying to fix this and will have to cut a good 2 inches from the ends. Never again!"

So, I pretty much got the kit to have a matching brush, comb, aspirator, medicine dropper, tooth brush, and bag to hold of all it. So, for the price, I saved money by not buying each of those things separately.

The 2700 can. I have the 3700, but it has turbo, which means the motor runs slower, but can be jumped faster, but the 1700 runs the right speed all the time.

Maybe the cutter was not seated, but afterit quieted down, it still vibrates my nose when I do my cheeknear my nose, and causes my sinuses to vibrate, though itis slight, but uncomfortably.4) It is harder to clean, and is not water proof like Remington.5) Becasue it is reconditioned, the American Express Returnprotection that will take items back within 90 daysexcludes it, so I can't take the risk (Gold and Blue cards,and maybe others)You would think that something German would be engineered great, but I have had German cars, and that is bull.

I kept waking up to make the thing was still on my foot...and sure it's a secure fit but I was extremely conscious of it every night that I decided to wear it.I'm not sure what I was thinking when I bought this thing but I just don't like it.
227481,0,This safe-t-sport neoprene knee support is very good but there are some drawbacks to the support which I found out. The support does what it advertises to do and you have to measure the upper leg above the knee to get the right size. The drawback is not to wear it more than an hour or so as it will make your knee sweat. I also have poor circulation in my leg that I use the support on and in doing so after 3 hours or so my knee will swell. Not life threatening as you have to remove it to feel better.
179617,0,"We have one of these scrubbers at home & have used it for years, so I think of this as a good product, although it's hard to get it squirt soap. Just bought a new one for our vacation home -- it's been used maybe a month, but the handle leaks no matter what we do to stop it. This one will go in the trash."
222063,2,"I've used Cascade for years, but this new one--Cascade powder with Dawn--is awful. White residue on everything and, yes, I've cleaned my dishwasher with CLR, prewashed dishes, adjusted whatever I could and the results are the same. The Cascade website admits to--literally--a 1% satisfaction rate. Beware!"
92217,0,I have asthma for 30 years and asthma acts different with people. This unit didn't seem to help in the short run but I understand that it could be good for other people. I actually seemed to get some positive feeling from sniffing it up my nose rather than my mouth. After a couple of days I realized that I was sucking through this thing not knowing who had handled it or the salt inside so I attempted to wash it. Better late than never eh. It was easy to remove the salt and wash. But it became extremely slippery and it squirted out of my hands onto the stone tile floor and shattered. I am thinking about replacing it but I probably won't.
332572,1,I bought a number of different foot massagers and this one isn't bad. IMO:The Happy Company 00364 Foot & Body Roller Massaging Fingers does a better job.
297305,2,"I purchased this product at a local market. I had hoped that this would give me some protection, and stay away from certain chemicals that are harmful to the body. I work in retail unloading trucks and in customer service. This product failed in ALL of its claims immediately. I was extremely embarrassed. I know that this product caused multiple awkward situations between me and my co-workers. I also believe that this product harmed sales in my store that day.When I contacted the company about their abysmal failure via their website, I have received no response. That was over a month ago. They haven't said a single thing over a whole month! I strongly, STRONGLY recommend you do not buy this product. As far as I am concerned, this is purely a scam product. You'll pay money for something that can't even begin to hold up to its name."
286522,0,"I tried to base these on whether or not I would recommend to a friend more so than personal opinion.Personally, I decided to get the Naturals because I work out 2-3 times a day and always drink a whey shake after... ingesting that much artificial sweetener every day will probably add up to cancer one day. The Natural Nectars use stevia, which has actually been shown to have positive effects such as regulating blood sugar.Flavors:Apple Ecstasy - 4/5 - I normally like apple-flavored anything, but this did not impress me. It's a little too sour. However, there was no aftertaste or anything, so I'm sure someone out there might like it.Caribbean Cooler - 5/5 - I must say I was impressed with how the coconut aspect of this coconut/pineapple flavor concoction really captures the taste and texture of real coconut milk. Would I want to drink 2 lbs. of this stuff? Eh, IDK. But if you like coconut...Crystal Sky - 2/5 - Tastes like ground up Sweet-Tarts mixed with water. It's a very, very synthetic berry taste of some sort. It has so much blue coloring that my poo was bright green!Fuzzy Navel - 5/5 - This is the flavor that made Nectar famous. It's a nice blend of peach and orange and tastes like a glass of juice; I could not detect any protein, and the aftertaste was mostly just peach flavor.Lemon Tea - 3/5 - I really wanted to dislike this one, and although I'm still not a fan of iced tea protein (lol), I can see why some people would like it. I can clearly detect an underlying protein taste, but ignore that and it's just like Arizona iced tea.Roadside Lemonade - 1/5 - This one is nasty, I could barely get it down! The obvious protein taste gives it a gelatin-like quality. So, yeah, (synthetic) lemon-flavored liquid Jell-O is how I'd describe it.Strawberry Kiwi - 3/5 As soon as I smelled it, I knew this was going to be another Jell-O flavor. Honestly it's not that bad (no kind of protein taste or aftertaste), but most of us have had strawberry kiwi Jell-O, and so drinking it in liquid form is rather unappealing.Twisted Cherry - 2/5 - Extremely synthetic cherry Kool-Aid flavor (just like children's medicine) with way too much red color.Strawberry Mousse - 5/5 - Tastes like the pink Yoohoo or strawberry milk. Slight bitter aftertaste, but not a big deal.Vanilla Bean Torte - 5/5 - I normally don't like vanilla, but this is just like frosting (yummmm)! There is a slight ""metallic"" aftertaste (Acesulfame K can do that), but not as bad as the weird Chocolate Truffle aftertaste.Chocolate Truffle - 4/5 - It's like watered down chocolate mousse. I'm not a big chocolate fan, but someone who likes that kind of thing would probably enjoy this flavor. I took a point off because it had a strange aftertaste.Cappuccino - 5/5 - Personally, it's way too sweet for me (but I really don't have much of a sweet tooth). I like my coffee black, but someone who is into those Starbucks shakes would probably like this. It actually reminds me a lot of a mocha flavored chocolate bar Lindt sells called ""Milk Mocha.""Natural Peach - 5/5 - The best of the ""naturals."" It's kind of orangey-peachy, but in a more toned down way than Fuzzy Navel.Natural Orange - 3/5 - My least favorite of the ""naturals,"" but it's okay.Natural Fruit Punch - 5/5 - Didn't like this one at 1st, but it grew on me. It's not like a Hawaiian Punch kind of taste, but more like fruit-flavored Tums."

317203,0,"This wipes warmer is pretty good when it comes to warming wipes, but the major problem is the funky lid. There's a button to open the lid and it pops open and has this squeaky ""haunted house"" door sound when it opens. The thing won't stay closed, so wipes will dry out. The first time the lid snapped open with that creepy squeaky sound, I was asleep and it just about scared the bejeezus out of me! Hubby also couldn't stand it anymore so we bought a Munchkin warmer instead. The Prince Lionheart does have the antimicrobial inside which is great, but the part where you pull out the wipes is tricky and we ended up having wipes get stuck and they'd rip when we went to pull them out."

258816,2,"I have twins in high chairs throwing food on the floor for every meal, so I was really looking forward to this. You are supposed to push the button for fluid when you push the vac. forward and the suctioning happens when pulling back.The problem is the squeegie on the front makes it hard to push it forward. Also...the dry vac. portion is just o.k., not as good as I hoped. Once you switch from dry to wet, you can't go back to dry to a different area/room as water will drip everywhere. This was harder on my back than just doing it the old fashion method. I am returning it. And I so hoped this was going to make my life easier! oh well. hohoho."
381550,2,I bought these and absolutely hate them! I wish I could return them. They are too thick and too small. They don't absorb very much at all. I am changing these at every nursing session. There are much thinner pads out there that absorb much better. Don't waste your money.
372238,2,"I take 4 of these a day. I am now into my second bottle and have seen zero difference.I stopped using chemical shampoo and conditioner. I changed to Wen cleansing conditioner, Wen SixThirteen treatment, Rene Furterer Thin Hair Treatment and will be starting to use John Masters Organic shampoo and Deep Scalp Follicle Treatment & Volumizer as soon as it gets here (I've just read some really bad reviews for the Wen hair system, so I'm going to stop using it). I've also tried Castor oil/Jojoba oil scalp treatments. I stopped chemically coloring my hair and use Henna, Amla and Herbatint ONLY. I will never use chemicals on my hair again.I take Biotin, fish oil and Hair Revive (among other supplements). I've been taking these since October and with these and everything else I have been doing for my hair loss, I see no improvement and it may even be worse. Not only have these not worked, THEY TASTE AWFUL. REALLY, REALLY awful.I take a lot of supplements and out of them all, this is the only one that has a taste (VERY BAD TASTE) and makes me gag. I can taste the ingredients through the thin capsule. I'll probably finish the last bottle just because I hate wasting things, but will more than likely not buy these again. If they worked, I'd force myself to take them despite the horrid taste, but as far as I can tell, they do nothing for my hair loss - Your mileage may vary, but I wanted to tell my story which does vary from the 4/5 star reviews (which is why I bought it).I rarely leave 1 or 2 star reviews, but I felt this product didn't deserve more from me. You will have to decide if you want to spend the money and see if it works for you. I wish you much luck and hope it does."

All pain aside, It has been almost 3 weeks since I used the epilator and I have a lot less hair than ever before...I recommend it for its effective hair removal that can last upto 3 weeks, but the pain is something you'll have to take...pain is beauty so...good luck!"

I have never had a problem with the velcro closure on the back of my head. I sleep upright in a recliner due to neck problems. My issue with the mask is the lack of quality in the construction. This mask is apparently glued together around the edges. After 3 months of continuous use, the edges are pealing off. It looks like I have 2 masks on top of each other. I would buy this again if it were cheaper or put together better. I am now forced to find another alternative because I can't afford a new one every 3 months."
296815,0,"I have bought twin labs before and they have been very effective, however the amino acid pills didnt really do anything for me personally. I take the twin labs strength creatine pills and those work amazing.I am 21 yrs old male 185lbs. i work out 4-5 times a week. Working out to gain mass.Heres a few things have to say:The pills are gigantic. I dont mind taking larger pills but i havent seen any pills this big. Although they are easy to swallow just beware they are a bit big.The label says to take three after each meal. I took three twice a day and i dont think the extra three would have changed my opinion about these. 9 a day seems a bit much to me.When i take the twinlabs creatine strength pills i really feel a pump when i go to the gym, but with these i didnt feel anything. From what ive read they are supposed to help in recovery and build muscle but i didnt really see any difference.I took these religiously for a month and i didnt see any weight gain attributed to taking them. Ive gained about 15 pounds in the past two months but i think it is more directly related to eating more, working out hard and drinking protein shakes. I havent taken them in a few weeks and i am still seeing gains.I think when it comes to pills, we are all affected differently. Whereas the strength ones work for me these might work for someone else. I didnt see any additional benefits but that shouldnt deter you from trying them yourself.Everyone reacts differently so try many different things until you find what your looking for. I have tried about 10 different brands of protein shakes until i finally found one that i liked and one that made me gain weight. I recommend muscle tech products more specifically the nitro tech is a great protein shake. Thanks for reading."

304129,0,I have to be honest. I have no idea if this stuff is really working. At least its not hurting. The studies on it as a supplement are so inconclusive. I took a chance and I'm finding the same results. Its been a month and a half so I would think the effects would be noticeable by now. If anything else changes I'll update.
330981,0,"We bought this machine for our baby's room, which faces a busy street. In does a decent job, but all-in-all I think I like sound of a fan better. I read quite a few of these reviews and found some people who think it's too loud, and others who think it's not loud enough. I think the real issue is the pitch of the sound, which is noticeably higher than the sound of the fan, so it doesn't do a great job masking low-pitch noise. Perhaps the larger model would do a better job. I would recommend finding a place where you can hear it for yourself before buying it."

Of the three I bought [ outdoor use ]and the one I had [regular use], the jaws bend with an amazing lack of force. Stronger jaws would make this tool immensely better for day to day use. I would hope the company will improve the product and update the ones that have already been sold. I can not recommend this tool as it is.

When I turn the entire kit in different directions, the compass needle either doesn't move or it points in the wrong direction. I may ask the company to replace it.The firestarter generates a substantial spark. Other reviews of the firestarter claim it takes a many attempts to generate a spark; my unit generated a spark immediately. I like the one-handed design. I can hold tinder in a high-wind situation with one hand, and generate a spark with my other hand. Also, if one hand is bruised, the tool only requires one hand.It is easy to put the contents back into the sturdy bag.The directions provide clear advice.The white cord is supposedly for fishing. I'm surprised the unit does not include some fishing line. I guess fish are not bothered by a white cord if there's a worm on the hook."

These are a little larger, by about 1/2"" per side. The others are a bit wetter, which is actually a bit of a nuisance. Other than that, they are identical.These are just great for cleaning lenses. They are alcohol based, so they clean aggressively and leave no film if used properly. By that I mean that you have to wipe your lens, then let the cloth evaporate a bit, and go back over the lens to remove any streaks. Be sure to blow off or brush off your lens before using these or any other cloth for that matter.I now carry a bunch of these (the cheap ones) in my camera bag, replacing a bottle of lens cleaner and a cloth, and use them to clean off everything from my lenses to my sunglasses and phone."

The same thing is happening to the one at work and to a another pad I had.An open plea to any TheraTherm engineers that might look at this. PLEASE FIX THE CORD!!"

361818,0,"Energy bars are a hard sell -- they're either too sweet or too dense or too grainy or too gooey -- you get the picture. These Balance Bars do a nice job of combining flavor with nutrients and energy. The interior of the bar is dense and chewy with a nice berry taste, although it's hard to taste the berries sometimes. The yogurt covering is a great touch -- delicious and not too sweet. My roommates are split on the bars, however. One roommate loves them and plans to take them in her purse for a quick snack whenever she needs an energy boost. The other roommate, however, hates the texture and can't imagine eating one again. Overall, these bars are surprisingly good for energy bars. Just remember that you're consuming a nutritional supplement and not a candy or granola bar."

Although this might not be a fair amount of time I was in agony over my lips and needed a quick fix. I was in need of moisturizing my lips and repairing them, not just protecting them from further damage.I turned to Mentholatum Natural Ice hoping this would be an improvement over Burt's (for me, not that either product is bad) only to find out they were pretty much the same. There was no noticeable difference and my lips weren't improving after another 3 days.I would recommend this product for proactive lip protection, but I would look elsewhere for a moisturizing lip balm when being reactive to cracked/chapped lips."

After a few hours we notice that we don't really smell it around 6 ft away, so we opened it up a little bit more.We used then for a week but we barely notice the smell. Looking inside I noticed that there is just a very small amount left; only around 80% of the solid gel-like freshener is there. Not really happy with this purchase."

Works great and there's not waste. Speick products have a very distinct fragrance. This has the same fragrance as other Speick products.

A wholesome natural diet free from added sugars is natures best medicine & cure for a host of problems.Unfortunately I have taken these probiotics for a very long time and have not noticed a single improvement in digestion. This is very disapointing to me. I don't know if it's the brand & another would be more effective or if it's simply supplement hype (I have tried the pearl brand & it wasn't effective either).I have since explored the SCD (specific carbohydrate diet) with much improvement! If you find that probiotic supplementation is ineffective for you as well, you might want to consider the diet I mentioned. This is not a weight loss diet. It's an intestinal health diet."

I needed a wrap that I could wear while I ran errands and one that couldhelp with pain on the go.

91081,0,"My shopping criteria were:1) A simple white noise machine to mask tinnitus and extraneous noises (snoring dogs, fighting cats, etc)2) Decent sound quality, without annoying repetitions/transitions3) Compact, unobtrusive, and convenientI purchased the Marsona TSC-330 because lower priced machines seem to have problems with sound quality. In addition, many claim an array of special sound effects which are often reported to be ineffective, and which violate the KISS principle. Simple is good.I am satisfied with the sonic output of the Marsona, and use it every night. It does the job. However, it is not without its annoyances, and in today's electronics marketplace, it is outrageously overpriced for its functionality (for example, consider that you can buy a DVD player with a full-function remote for half this price).The on/off switch is extremely flimsy and stiff. It is a three-position sliding switch, with the off position in the center. Sliding it to one extreme turns on the constant white noise, and at the other extreme, it activates the variable white noise (a crude wave sound). The switch is recessed into a tight nook located at the bottom rear of the unit, the least accessible location imaginable (unless they placed it inside the cabinet, requiring a screwdriver to access). It is sometimes necessary to pick the unit up and turn it around to operate the switch, which has a tendency to overshoot the central ""off"" position no matter how carefully it is maneuvered. A real nuisance for the most-used control.The two remaining controls, volume and tone, are sliders located under the side wings of the unit. I set them once and don't mess with them, but again, their location and orientation are poor - you need to flip the unit upside down to see which is which.I am rating the product 3 stars, though 2.5 is more realistic. To earn 5 stars, especially in view of its price, the Marsona should:1) Mount the controls in an accessible location.2) Use a decent quality power switch.3) Provide a simple on/off remote control. Instructions recommend that the unit be placed on the opposite side of the room for maximum effectiveness. A bedside remote would be helpful.4) Enable battery power so that the unit is truly travel-friendly.I am confident that these improvements could be made while preserving the manufacturer's high profit margin, and would result in a product that not only helped me sleep better - at home or on the road - but also made me feel that some thought went into its (usability) design."
310582,0,"The fragarence isn't nearly as long lasting as I had hoped, for the cost. The scents are a bit vague, citrus is not very sharp and the lime is almost the same as the citrus, but then of course, lime is citrus...isn't it. All in all it's great when you need a quick freshener in case someone is dropping by in a few minutes, but the long lasting effects are slight. Advertisement talks about *rain forest mist* and I don't get any of that feeling at all. In my opinion it is a bit pricey for the effects in general. You get the same effect from aromatherapy essential oils and they are much cheaper and organic."

289370,0,"I wanted to leave a review to respond to a couple of other reviewers.Not all moms have the time or desire to use prefold diapers with pins and diaper covers. I know I certainly don't want to bother with it. These are a great way for a mom to use cloth diapers, without all the hassle of trying to make a rectangle fit a wiggling baby.Also, yes, you do need to change cloth diapers more frequently than disposables. That's one of the reasons cloth diapers are healthier for baby's skin. I personally think it's absolutely apalling that anyone would let their child sit in urine for 2 or more hours. That's disgusting.About the product itself - there are better cloth diapers out there; a search on the internet will yield excellent results. But, if you're looking for a fitted cloth diaper that you can buy in a store, these will serve the purpose. You will need to buy at least 3 packages, though, to have enough diapers to only need to wash a load every other day."

112588,0,"As far as the ingredients go, if I were judging by ingredients alone and not by nutritional content, this is a pretty decent multivitamin supplement. I have taken the adult Source of Life vitamins before and done well on them.As far as the vitamin and mineral content, however, I find these disappointing.The vitamin A isn't vitamin A at all, but beta carotene. I believe beta carotene is one of the most overrated ""nutrients"" I have ever found in a supplement, so much so that even the government disseminates incorrect information about it. If you are an infant or a child under the age of five, if you are hypothyroid, if you are diabetic or have any of a number of other health issues, or just if you just did not win the genetic lottery, beta carotene is near useless to you as a vitamin A source. Even when you can convert it optimally, you only convert as much as you need, and don't store any vitamin A away for later. So if you don't keep eating things with beta carotene in them, it is all too easy to become deficient in vitamin A. We are seeing a lot of nearsightedness now, a lot of infertility and a lot of children being born with urinary tract defects (the Mayo Clinic says this is the most common type of birth defect in the United States, in fact--Google it), all conditions connected with insufficient vitamin A intake, alongside the incredible claims made that most Americans get ""too much"" vitamin A. If you are going to give this supplement to your children, especially children under five, get some real vitamin A into them as well.The vitamin D in this supplement is sub-par as well. It's ergocalciferol, or vitamin D2. As with beta carotene to vitamin A, we are not good converters of D2 to D3. If you must give this supplement to your children, make sure they get dietary sources of D3 as well. Mushrooms all contain D2, when they contain D at all. Salmon and tuna and pork are good vitamin D3 sources. Also, get them out into the sun at mid-day at least a few times a week, with no sunscreen, for at least twenty minutes per session. (Watch out for sunburn, obviously.)And finally, I am not picking specifically on Source of Life for this one because it's a shortcoming of nearly all multivitamin supplements, but they have the wrong form of B12. The proper form of B12 is methylcobalamin, a substance referred to as a methyl donor that is important in several bodily processes. Cyanocobalamin is a cheap alternative that displaces real B12. A diet high in folate can counteract some of the effects because folate is also a methyl donor, but you're going to suffer nerve damage in the long run if you have no dietary sources of B12 (like beef, a food lots of people try to avoid now) and rely only on your multivitamin to get this vitamin at all. There are separate B12 supplements that are the methyl form, and you may be stuck with those because the few multis that contain real B12 are expensive. Methyl B12 tablets at least taste good; I give them to my 7yo daughter and she really likes them.And those are the flaws that stand out at me. There may be others, but I'm still learning, so I may have missed them.Looking forward to the day that the supplement industry quits playing us for suckers. I believe wholeheartedly, and have experienced for myself, that supplementation does improve health. But you have to know what you are doing because at best, otherwise, you will be wasting your money and at worst, you could hurt yourself. Do your research and don't just be taken in by label claims."

355961,1,"When I started using Ginsana Gold Formula over five years ago, it helped me get through the tough days called ""change of life."" I managed to get through these years with a combination of three over-the-counter products. One was Remifemin, (with black cohash and rhyzome) one was vitamin E, and the third was Ginsana multiple vitamins. Whenever I would run out of one of those three products, the symptoms would start to reappear. Then I started to have difficulty finding the Ginsana in the stores. I looked on the internet and discovered the packaging was changed and the stores in my area had stopped carrying it. So I tried another multiple vitamin again and plain Ginsana but it left me with some nausea and very fatigued. I decided to try the internet again and was successful in finding a site that would ship the product directly to my home. Thank God for that. I will soon be feeling the old energy again!"

425447,0,"This mirror is very similar to the Windmere unit that I had for about 10 years and loved until it wouldn't turn on any more. The lighting on the Jerdon is clean and bright and the overall design is good. However, the quality of the mirrors is such that the reflection is distorted, especially on the magnified side. I'm not talking about the distortion that the magnification naturally creates. Unlike the magnification distortion, my eyes take a few moments to adjust to this distortion (sort of like putting on someone else's prescription eyeglasses). This is likely due to the reflective surface being of a lesser optical quality. So far it's the the best I've found without spending big bucks, but perhaps that's why some other mirrors are more expensive.7/3/10 UPDATE. I have found the distortion the mirror causes to be too irritating. Also, the lights are taking longer and longer to turn on. I will be looking for a different mirror soon."

Apparently, at some point in time some ass clown filed a law suit and changed heating pads forever.That said, this also is flawed, hence only my 3 star rating. The flaw is that the heating elements are wrapped in a type of plastic that doesn't hold its shape. It bends, folds, creases and curls. Therefore, you have to unsnap the cover, pull it out and physically stretch it back out with your hands. You can get it fairly close to its original shape, but not really and it takes a diligent effort at that.Probably still a good price value, but why can't we all just get what we want??!!"

Also, as some other reviewers have noted your hydration level affects the reading as well.I worked out and ate right for months and could see the difference in my clothes yet the monitor barely changed within a percentage point. I have since had by body fat tested 3 times using another method and once using calipers. I've reduced by body fat by 5% in two months and the monitor still hasnt moved- no matter what time of day or how hydrated I am. I will hold on to it and see if it is more accurate as I continue to lose weight-just out of curiosity-but obviously have to use other methods to test body fat.BTW, the reading was 10% too low based on my other test."

322949,0,I bought these for my nighttime incontinent older child. My child is 5'2 and weighs about 100 pounds. These are too big and leak.

I'd say they will fit a waist of at least 26-28 inches.The price is better than any other pull on diaper I could find (especially with the subscribe and save discount) but the fit just doesn't work well for a skinny kid. Maybe they would work better for a more developed filled out but thin older person.

Of course I got concerned and got my readings at the doctor's office again - my bp was unchanged but the monitor was off by 20 points on the systolic. After few more days of different readings it was off by 40 points. I was going to throw the thing away, than thought of taking out the batteries and putting them in again - and Presto! Accurate readings again. Because of wrong readings that it gave and the lack of a recalibration on this, I only give it three stars. If you are having problems with this, Reboot the thing by taking out the batteries and putting them in again."

(Wear your glasses or contacts while using.) The switch feels like it wouldn't endure heavy usage. The handle seems cheaply made with fair fit and finish. The head quality seems low-end and simple but decent enough to use regularly.I consider the opthalmoscope unusable due to the brightness of the light. I tried the light on myself from about 1 foot and it is unacceptable - and you really need to be closer to do a proper examination. Maybe I'll try some older batteries to see if that helps, but Welch Allyn needs to correct this problem."

I was really hoping these would be the answer to my prayers...my new neighbors think their apartment is a club on weekends. The ear plugs definitely dampened the noise, but did not cut it off completely. I can't imagine they would work for noise in the same room, such as snoring (I could hear the very quiet fan next to my bed).In addition, I am a side sleeper and as soon as I turned over and laid my ear on the pillow the seal created by the plug was broken, which pretty much defeated the purpose of using the plugs. Perhaps I was using pieces that were too big. I cut one in half and used those halves one in each ear...I may try cutting into quarters but I'm a little nervous about using too small pieces and getting them stuck.As far as comfort, they were as comfortable as ear plugs can get (I don't know what people expect, if there's something in your ear you will be at least vaguely aware of it). They are waxy and I suppose a bit messy when you are rolling them in your hands to shape them, but again I don't really know what people expected to happen, they are wax after all. I didn't find them overly messy.I hope that the addition of a louder fan or noise machine in my room, and the possibility of using smaller pieces will help! I wish the seal stayed intact when I turned on my side, everyone else raved about this but I could literally feel and hear it pull away immediately. If you sleep on your back anyway, you might as well get the earphone things, will probably work better."

Same effect. Note: Someone before was not that bright and couldn't understand the part about a 150mg vs 300mg dosage. 300mg is the recommend dosage for St. John's wort. Most people take 900mg a day or 300mg 3 times a day. At 150mg that's 2 pills 3 times a day or 6 pills total. With this product it's only 1 pill 3 times a day or 3 pills total. They were angry with me because they wanted to take just 1 pill a day. As far as I know a 900mg dosage does not exist. I always wonder about people who just impulsively buy a supplement without doing any research on their own.These pills are nice because it only takes one pill for the recommend dosage. I take three at a time rather than one three times daily. It seems to work just as well taking it this way. The 150mg dosage takes 6 pills which is just overkill for me. This will make you bleed more, so be sure to know how that will affect your health or current health problems: ulcers, hemorrhoids,daily aspirin therapy, statins, or MAO inhibitors. I'm not a doctor, but I've read some studies that say St. John's Wort works better than prescription anti-depressants.

192322,0,This toothpaste should be cheaper. It does lighten the color of your teeth but not dramatically. This is a worthwhile purchase if you just buy the toothpaste not this exact one with the whitening excelerator.
423654,0,"I've been buying these for a couple years now.Starting 6-9 months ago, the bars are often dripping in oil. Not moist, dripping. They use to always be the same slightly moist texture. Lately, I've even received boxes that were oil stained.I've called a couple times to complain, but they never call back.I still occasionally buy these, though only when I'm going to be home or office so I have multiple paper towels to soak up the oil.A couple years ago, I would have given them 5 stars. Not anymore."

247493,0,"Years ago I bought the pre-made product which lasted forever and did a beautiful job for cleaning jewelry. It works really well on diamonds and gets them to sparkle unlike anything else I have found. So when it finally ran out I was happy to find this refill concentrate here on Amazon. It is a great idea as I am all for reducing waste and being environmentally friendly. However I found the product to be less satisfying to use, it just didn't look the same. It doesn't have the consistency as the original product which seemed to cling to the jewelry better. Mixed as directed this just seems like grey-blue water. It will clean, but I think I would prefer the original formulation. This is unfortunate because it is a great idea and more cost effective to mix your own. I would still buy this again if they quit making the original because it is still a good product."

Even though the rolls have more sheets than Green Forest, I end up using more paper because this paper is: thinner, rougher and less absorbent. I don't think that I will be buying this again.Update: after using this for a while, I would say that I eventually got used to it and it doesn't feel rough anymore. But when I initially switched to it from the softer TP that's how it felt!"

317034,0,"We registered for and received this wipe warmer as a gift with our first child. We liked the product and found that the baby didn't fuss as much with warm wipes as with cold ones while being changed. After a few months, however, the lid refused to stay shut. It got to the point where I would have to put something on top of the lid to keep it closed, otherwise the wipes near the top would dry out. I am now expecting my second child, and while we still use this product, we will have to explore other brands (if there are any who make something similar) or replace the one we have."

When I tried to replace that one I found Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet in a local store, I had to buy it because they did not have a waterpik and I could not live with out one!!. When I tried Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet I was pleasantly surprised by its performance, it was quiet and jet had enough force but it did not hurt my gums at all!!!. A big problem with Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet was that it has a smaller tank, so you have to stop and refill 3-4 times before you complete!!!."

Kinda think, creamy, smooth, etc. WRONG! It has a strong sharp flavor just like an energy drink. Regardless, I slammed it down and now I have some pretty interesting jitters.I will not mix this with water again. It would go great with vodka. Definitely vodka. Not tequila, not rum. Vodka.Maybe I'll use it in home made ice cream too. That should be interesting.Did I say jitters?Yow"

I've never really had this problem with any other organic or conventional hair product."

183018,0,It works as described but every time I shave a few hairs come out. It cleans up well after use. The hairs are soft and it fits comfortably in your hand.
283081,0,This shaver worked well the first couple of times.. I would say around the 5th or 6th time using it the shave is not close at all and you have to go over the hairs a few times. Also Cleaning the blades are a bit difficult.

38382,0,"I love this little machine, yes its hard to hold but not impossible. But what i really love about it is that it removes all the hairs and quickly. It worked great on my arms and under arms.I'm spanish so I have dark hair in my arms and it removed them completely and I can go 2 weeks with out having to go over it. On my legs I did get hair bumps but I'm going to try it couple more times to see if that stops. It didn't hurt at all on my legs, arms. stomach and underarms. But in the bikini line there was some pain but it wasn't unbearable. I'd def recommended this product. Try if it doesn't work for you return it but like I said in my title for me it exceeded all my expectations!*****UPDATE******I've been using this for a while now and in my opinion it works the best on fine hair. My arms were never shaved so I had fine hair therefore I had the best results on my arms. I've given up on legs, I get the worst hair bumps whenever I use this machine and it takes a while for my legs to look good again. Also I really hate the design I've dropped this machine several times because it just slipps off my hands. Last time I used it I dropped it and it's been slow if it dies I won't be replacing it. I dont need to use it on my arm pits and bikini line anymore because I've been getting laser treatments.Overall I'll give it a 3 * because I got great results on my arms."
86113,0,"When I registered for this item, it seemed like a good, all-in-one kit. I have found the brush, comb, nail clippers and bathtub thermometer to be quite useful. BUT, the nasal aspirator is too hard to be of any use, and the medicine dropper is made of a similar, unflexible plastic. It's hard enough to use these items in general on an infant, but the products here turn it into a baby wrestling match. I ended up buying a separate nasal aspirator and a separate medicine dropper. In retrospect, I would have been better off registering for a grooming kit and then the individual &quot;medical&quot; items separately."

227423,0,"I got this foot spa because it was the best reviewed here on Amazon, but it's really only OK.Negatives:1. It does not keep the water warm for long. I filled it with HOT water, but it became tepid in just a few minutes, and I could not feel heat emanating from the bottom of the spa.2. Part of the reason the water cools off so quickly is the basin is so shallow.3. The ""reflexology"" attachments are not very helpful because you cannot use them on the whole foot. The instructions say to roll the whole sole of the foot over the attachment, but because of their placement, and the small size of the basin, I could only get my arch and heel over it; I could not get the ball of my foot over it. (I wear a woman's size 9, so sure, I have big feet, but they're not huge.)4. It's noisy.5. They only want you to use it for 20 minutes, so why not add a timer or auto-turn-off feature?Positives:1. You can turn it on and off with your toe.2. The spout for drainage is well placed.3. The bubbles are nice.4. It's cheap."
205633,0,"I love that I can get pretty much all of my supplements all in one whole-foods shake! The vanilla flavor isn't unpleasant, but the chalkiness is definitely going to take some getting used to. I've experimented with different preparation methods, and the most palatable has been mixing it into a smoothie with almond milk. I am going to try the soy version of this product and decide which I like better.One issue I have been having is a lot of bloating, which I've read is common when first starting to consume spirulina and chlorella. Its only been a few days, so I'm give my body time to adjust before switching to another type of shake."
389150,0,"I ordered standard size goggles, iridium lens. I received them nicely packed with the sign clearly stating on the box that the size is standard. I don't have a particularly large head, but these could be barely put on, not to mention trying to ""clic"" them. I read anywhere in the review here that some guy was unlucky because he was getting them too big or too small, i'd say he was lucky to get them too big. To be precise i proceeded and measured them so buyers can compare and see for themselves.The goggles measure 5.5 inch wide and 8.75 inch long when stored in the original box. The lens is approximately 2.25 inch at its widest point. Once again these were supposed to be a standard size. If any of you have small size goggles please post the measurements so we can compare.The magnet which holds the glasses together is not particularly strong, so expect them to come off every now and than."

360621,0,"If you're searching for the BEST TASTING protein mix, this is it hands-down! But if you're like me, you'll soon find that it gets quite expensive and you're always running low or out of it because of the SMALL cans. I started out with the 1.65 lb cans and with only 15 servings per container, that was lasting only ONE WEEK with one shake in the morning and one after a workout or Tae Kwon Do class. This 3.3 lb can will get you through 2 weeks at 2 shakes a day...But you're still talking about $90/month or more for a protein supplement. And if you take 3 a day (directions suggest 2-3 servings/day), then you'll go through the 1.65 lb can in 5 days and this 3.3 lb can in 10 days. At that rate, you'll also be paying around $130-$150/month at current Amazon prices. While I have found ""cheaper"" prices online, they stick it to you on shipping charges and can take several days to get it to you. Amazon's Muscle Milk Light prices with FREE 2-day Prime shipping are pretty hard to beat!The TASTE is simply excellent! It tastes more like a melted Vanilla Frosty from Wendy's than a protein supplement. However, I kept looking for alternatives because it really does get expensive. I went through a process and found an acceptable substitute that may help those of you also searching for a protein supplement that works, tastes good and doesn't break the bank. Long story short, here's what I mix:1 scoop ofEAS Premium Vanilla Protein Powder 6 Lb Bag (Pack of 5)1 scoop ofFreak Fix-Muscle Asylum Project Protein Matrix, Pure 2lb White Vanilla1 scoop ofCorvalen M (12 oz, 56 servings)Mix these with about 10-12 oz of water. This is a very good tasting shake that has not only helped me with new muscle growth...But I also ""feel"" like my muscles are stronger, and this is something Muscle Milk Light never did for me. I won't bore you with all of the details of each of these supplements, but some are worth mentioning. A 6 lb bag of the EAS sells for about $25 at our local Costco. There are 78 2-scoop servings per bag, meaning it lasts me 78 days at 2 shakes/day at my above mix. The 2 lb Freak Fix container currently sells for $9.95 each with FREE Prime shipping at Amazon (I just ordered 3 more). The scoop is HUGE and at 14 2-scoop servings per container, it lasts me 14 days. NOTE: AVOID THE CHOCOLATE Freak Fix, unless you're feeling particularly gutsy...It's horrible tasting, a weird purplish color and it looks like you've been eating pure tar after you drop the kiddies off at the pool (go #2). Stay with the vanilla. The Corvalen M works at a cellular level and has been ""clinically proven to restore cellular energy needed to promote healthy tissue function, increase exercise tolerance and improve quality of life."" It's not cheap, but it works. The Corvalen M has 56 1-scoop servings per container so it lasts me 28 days.I can drink one of these shakes and go through a 1-hr Black Belt class followed immediately by a 45-min Family Class with my boys, and still be ready for MORE...And I'm not sore the next day! This ""formula"" combines 2 very good whey protein supplements (each with their own ""advantage"" claims) with the Corvalen M needed to maximize the use of the proteins at the cellular level. For 2 shakes a day, every day, it costs me about $75 per month and I honestly think I could spend 5 times that much and not get the results I get with my protein shake recipe. Give it a try and let me know what you think!UPDATE: Wow...Our local Costco just replaced the above EAS 6 lb bag of protein with a MUSCLE MILK 6 lb bag of Whey Protein for only $28.99! Unbelievable! CytoSport makes the best tasting protein you're going to find anywhere, and this is just a GREAT PRICE for 80 servings per bag. I still like the Freak Fix vanilla from above and I now mix 1 scoop of it with 1 scoop of Corvalen M and 1 scoop ofCytoSport Muscle Milk 100% Whey Protein 27g 6lb Bag of Vanilla. The result is a HIGH-POWERED, great-tasting protein shake that provides your body with 44g of protein per shake and only costs about $43/month at 1 shake/day. This is 88% of the ""Daily Value"" and is A LOT OF PROTEIN for most people! You don't want to overload your kidneys with too much protein to process and you can simply adjust the amount you want/need by adjusting the scoop size (eg., 1/2 a scoop instead of a full scoop). Remember that you also get protein through a normal diet. I LOVE THIS SHAKE!! I hope you do too..."

When I removed the tape, the blisters formed a red line that showed the outline of where the tape had been. I have had some problems with rashes from adhesives before but was surprised by how big these blisters were. I like the tape itself and am able to use it on my foot without any problems so far.

410170,0,"I had heard quiet a bit about colon cleansing and thought at 40 I had better try one. Having gone through the radical option of an 9 day fast on a liquid only diet I was amazed just what came out after 4 days. The pictures in the marketing say it all. However I have to say that afterwards I felt weak rather than energetic like some other people reported. I lost 4Kg and later put 6Kg back on.I have mixed feelings about the results so I decided with a low value dollar and a 25% discount to try it again this time with the combined 21 day internal cleanse. Pretty much the same result except I actually feel fatter than I was before and still no boundless energy.I've given it a 3 star rating for its well designed packaging, marketing and accompanying books that explain everything very well so there is nothing to fear. In terms of benefits I felt and experienced I'd have to give it a 1 star rating."
415317,0,"This would work on a back with thin straight hair. On a man with curly, thick hair, it pulls and hurts. It does have a suprising amount of juice despite running on only two AA batteries. Blade is sharp and might work well for a woman who cannot reach down to shave her legs."

397973,0,I started taking this on the advice of my endocrinologist. She told me it's a good supplement to help raise HDL levels. I was on this and Tricor for Triglycerides/Cholesterol. After 3 months or so my Triglycerides were drastically reduced (due to the Tricor) and my choloesterol was in the normal range for both HDL and LDL (thanks to the combination). I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 due to the fact I can't prove 100% how much of the change is the Tricor and how much the Policosonal. But since things are vastly improved I'm not going to stop taking it just to see.
245779,0,This electric shaver is not perfect or as good as some reviews claim it to be. The braun 6000 series (now obsolete after this product came out) gives a much better shave believe it or not and the foil is shaped better than this one giving an easier shave to the face. Also I didnt like the fact that the braun 7526 has a cradle charger which means it cant be used as a corded shaver if the charge was low. You have to wait for it to recharge again which doesnt take that long but if you are in a rush often to get to work or dont wanna wait around than this can be an annoying problem compared to just plugging one in such as the braun 6000 series razors could be used as cordless or corded and and you can finish up without wasting any more time. As far as the actual shave the 7526 can give you a close shave but I have to go over the same spot several times to get it and this causes more skin irritation. This is not a bad shaver but is not nearly as good as the 6000 series designed brauns. Right now it sits unused for the most part as a backup shaver or emergency shaver in case my braun 6520 fails at some point. I truely believe that Braun made a mistake by making their 6000 series razors obsolete to this one because I and I know many others find the 7526 to be not as good and wouldve liked to see stores still selling the 6000 brauns.

43913,2,"You've got to question reviews that claim how this little device is ""accurate."" How do you know it's accurate? Compared to what? If this is your only device to measure your body fat percentage, how do you know it's correct? I know my bathroom scale is accurate because I can compare the results to a medical scale used at my gym or the doctor's office. What they probably mean is that it's consistent, not accurate.So unless you have been dunked in water for a body fat test to measure your water displacement or via some other proven method, it's difficult to say that this device is accurate. With that aside, I can say that this device delivers consistent results if you follow the instructions. It is also very well-made. The instructions are straightforward, it is easy to use, and the display is easy to view. As to the accuracy, I can only say after I have something to compare it to.*** January 2010 Update ***Since my original review, I've purchased the full-body Omron (much more expensive) body fat analyzer that is built into the scale with the foot sensors and attached hand grip sensors. The body fat percentage varies with this unit by 4%! I am still seriously questioning the accuracy of these devices. What good are these devices if they are off by 4%? This is now a 2-star product."

338317,0,Definitely useful if you have problems maintaining balance in the shower. Very heavily built and capable of holding a very large person. The 550 pounds is no exaggeration. It was and is indeed too short. I was aware that it would only extend to 17 inches but thought it would be adequate. It really isn't. At 17 inches I need help getting up from the bench when done in the shower. I'm keeping it as it works fairly well but would be MUCH more comfortable with about 3 inches more height. If it was adjustable to 20 inches it would be a 5 star purchase. As it is it will be a 3 star...

I put toys in there, I flipped it over and tried to lay him on his stomach - he was not having any of it. I wanted him to have more freedom, but now that he is developing a mind of his own, well, he definitely expressed his dislike for it. I will be passing this along to my brother and his wife. Perhaps it will work for them. I don't think it is the product, just my son's preference."

325688,0,"I've had the T630 for about 2 weeks & I use it a few times a week.The good:It does an amazing job on tiles. My grout went from black back to the original gray.The bad:Not so good on soap scum & mold. It couldn't get either off the bathroom tiles, but mine were extremely dirty. On medium high setting, it melted my paint off the walls. Cord too short & have to move it around each outlet to clean. I put tap in my boiler & the steam smells a little.The worst:The attachments have started coming apart within 2 weeks. Most the buttons & snaps use a spring system. First it was the button on my extension attachment. Now it's the snap bar on the floor attachment.Given the price & very few attachments provided compared to the whitewing model, I would expect the quality of the attachments to be better. I am sadly disappointed that I have to once again contact customer service from allergy buyers club. hopefully, they will help me out again. I will give you an update on their customer service & the T630 through it's lifecycle. For the amount you pay, it should last more than 1 year.If this machine breaks down & I have to bring it to a dealer within the yr, I will post another update on their warranty services. so far, koodles to allergy buyers club on their so far responsible & prompt manner in which they have been addressing my concerns.

239566,0,"Basic juicing questions are answered in the first section of this book, which focuses almost entirely on physical ailments. For each malady, the author gives general recommendations, dietary modifications, ""nutrients that help,"" and beneficial juices.At the end of the book, the author offers several dietary plans (sugar metabolism disorder, immune support, elimination diet, cleansing diets, and a basic diet). For each plan, there's a sample menu and dietary guidelines to follow. I really appreciated the inclusion of the cleansing diets because the author includes a juice fast plan. None of the other juicing books I've read bothered to make the effort to even touch upon juice fasting, which is what I was really interested in. So, I was really happy this author took the time to work it into her book.Although this book is a good resource, I only gave it three stars because, compared to other juicing books I've read, it fell short. While it offered information for certain ailments in depth, I think it could have benefited from a section that simply featured some basic juicing recipes. A less structured format for a portion, I think, would have made this book more appealing to a wider audience."
98829,2,"I bought this because a local vet recommended it for keeping my cat from freaking out and voiding itself everywhere on an upcoming car trip. I wish I'd read the label before purchasing it, because it's a homeopathic treatment. If you don't know what that is, the idea behind it is that water has ""memory"" and the more you dilute something, the stronger it magically becomes. If you don't understand my scorn because you have friends who swear by homeopathy, try diluting Kook-Aid twenty or thirty times and then tell me how much sweeter it becomes!Long story short, I got to listen to my cat howl for three hours while she peed and pooped all over the carrier. Of course, maybe I broke the homeopathy somehow, since I gave her twice the recommended dose."

When this pad arrived, I was surprised at how large it was (so really check the measurement size before you buy as this one would cover my whole back from shoulders to hips with heating pad left over!). The pad works as described with detailed instructions on using the item. But I've decided to return it for two reasons. First, it's a very bulky, ropey feeling heating pad. All heating pads come with instructions not to lay on them, but we do when we put them on our backs while sitting in chair. You can't do that comfortably with this one because of the wire coils protruding with this one. Very uncomfortable unless you just lay it across yourself. Second, its a very heavy heating pad. If you've used the ones from local stores (usually a Sunbeam brand), you know how lightweight those are. This heating pad weighs four lbs, but it feels much heavier. Its very cumbersome and unwieldy to use. Those are the reasons I'm returning it. I wanted to share this for the older customers so that you would realize the negatives of this item. As I mentioned previously, you are able to set the temperature as needed, but in my opinion, that feature is overridden by the fact that its so heavy and can only be laid across you (which means if you have a back injury, you have to lay face down and try to get it in position on your back or have someone else help you position it)."
16661,0,"you get exactly what you pay for, a simple zippo lighter in the box brand new. It does not come with fluid you will have to buy that separately (I've ordered some fluid from amazon, review coming shortly) but you cant mark it down for not coming with fluid because it says it doesn't. its a good basic zippo that i recommend to anyone who wants a zippo but doesn't quite want to pay a small fortune for the high end zippos on the market, i recommend this to anyone new to zippos, overall really great product.Now for the downsides, sometimes when in my pocket whilst on the move the insert comes out slightly this is terribly annoying as i keep having to pop it back in, also i noticed on the inside of the case there are yellow stains, not sure if thats with all zippo lighters or not.comes in a really nice black box to store and display the lighter, comes with a small booklet with info on zippos"

108926,0,"I have not had more of the worse side effects people have voiced in their reviews- the burning sensation for example- but I was shocked when a few weeks after my regular use of the deodorant, I saw the skin on my armpits peel! I didn't shave there much during the winter, but it became really obvious once I shaved my armpits and applying the deodorant regularly that the skin was peeling. I have a hunch that the men who use this product may not have this as an issue as much as women do (at least, those who shave their armpits), since men probably have more hair blocking direct contact with the deodorant onto their skin. I find the skin peeling issue somewhat ironic because the media has recently talked about how advertising companies are trying to make women feel bad about how their armpits look. Toms, you need to make a better formula so you won't have that problem!I used the Apricot scent, and it smells pretty wonderful- this is going to sound odd, but it's like my armpits smelled like jam! Ha! I have to remind myself to wear/reapply this deodorant because otherwise, I REALLY reek. This might be due to my body finally rid of the perspiration blockers from my previous antiperspirant. I just had no idea I could smell this good AND this bad.All in all, I didn't have as bad problems as other reviewers, but I can't exactly rave about it either. This is my first foray into non-aluminum products, so I may edit my review as I test other products out. 3/5 stars- not too bad/not that great."

96272,0,"I had a number of items that had stains, from tanks, to stuffed animals, to tablecloths - all ready for the garbage due to stains....and yet I could never seem to throw them out thinking someday I'd find a way to erase the stains. Theh I heard about RIT. I couldn't find it in any store, but found it on Amazon. The price is a little high for the oz capacity, but figured it was worth it. In using it, I've found that it works better than most removers - it completely removed long set-in stains from some shirts, and most of the ones on the stuffed rabbit, but others it didnt work - soooo I guess maybe it depends on the material, how long it's set and what type of stain. But overall, I'd say it's a good product.However, what wasn't good, was that it arrived 3/4 empty, having not been packaged well, it leaked into the envelope and plastic. Then I had to hassle with returning it for another."
404475,0,Here is the deal I have used these type of batteries for a while just buying them locally. These do not come in OEM packaging they come in some kind of plastic bulk packaging. I have a Pentax K-X DSLR that requires AA batteries and these are what I have always used. This time though I had bought the batteries as a backup set just in case what I had in went flat while I was on a trip for memorial weekend. Within two hours and about 200 pictures later I was already getting a low battery warning from the camera. When I get the batteries locally I can get about 600-1000 out of a new set. I don't know what the difference is with these batteries vs the ones I got where I live but these seem about 1/4 discharged or something. Otherwise I received them quickly and in good physical condition.

426886,1,"The first thing I will say was these pills were not bad. I have experimented with nootropics and focus enhancing drugs for the last couple years so when I came across these, my interest was peaked. I only purchased a thirty day supply, although I did not miss even one day. The effects I experienced while on this supplement can be compared to a low dose of piracetam. Concentration and focus levels are enhanced, but it is a very subtle feeling. I was able to study for longer periods of time and it also helped me retain some complicated formulas I was trying to learn.I think for the money there are more powerful supplements available which would make these cognitive effects more pronounced. The best experience I have had with any type of nootropic isPramiracetam Bulk Powder 25 Grams. I've taken piracetam, and even stronger versions of the racetam family such as aniracetam but the pram is by far the most potent racetam I have ever tried. Kind of hard to explain the feeling it gives you, but if you are researching racetams and nootropics, I would try pramiracetam."

111855,0,"These braces are well made and do the job of restricting my wrists and preventing carpal tunnel ""dead arm"" while I sleep. But these particular braces are designed to increase heat in the wrist area which I guess is meant to help heal, but I don't think the heat is going to ""heal"" my carpel tunnel and I find that for sleeping I get uncomforatably hot in them. They don't breathe at all and when I wake up my wrists are sweaty. In the summer, wearing these braces all night is out of the question. I can deal with them in the winter and I like how tightly they wrap around my wrist and I feel they restrict my movement better than some other braces I've tried. They have the metal splint on both sides of your wrist, whereas a lot of other braces have it on just one side. But the heat thing is a problem for me. I know that's how they were designed, but I guess they weren't meant for overnight use."
88403,0,"I was really excited to use this. It was great for sponge baths on the kitchen counter. Now that my daughter is 3.5 months old and uses the tub, I have to wash the Safer Bather after each use or it will smell. I did hang it in my shower to dry but it still smelled. I wash and dry it on the delicate cycle. Now that it gets regular use it is fraying. It is still useable but fuzzy, and the padding is worn down where my daughter keeps her head. So I have to make sure that the water level stays way low. I do like the fact that it hangs for storage."

I have tried and they are not worth it to get them done professionally.So, I buy them for the price and the color. Other nurses don't have gold scissors, so they are easy to claim as mine!So, I gave them 3 stars (because they don't have half stars) for price, moderate durability, and color.For the price they hold up for $5, so you can't really complain. They really weren't made to cut pants, cardboard, and plastic.Oh, I'm writing this on the patients account, who found them for me. and purchased them. I paid him back.

I bought this mask off amazon and let me tell you there IS a difference. The shape of the nose and eyes helps allot. The mask was allot thicker and more substantial than I expected. The material is comfortable (almost like a wetsuit material but softer) and it does a complete job of blacking out all the light. Forget the other masks, this one is super nice."

315900,0,"I like the concept of this measuring tape but you have to remember to add an inch to the measure you get when you complete a measurement. I am a seamstress, the items and people that I have to measure do not like this fact. They get quite distressed when they see me writing down another # from what they just witnessed me measure. The way that the tape is designed. the measurement starts at 2 rather than 0 the little end that tucks into the handle eats up the first few inches of the tape so the measurements have to be adjusted. I really wish they would fix this for people like me who use this tape for their living and the public whom they work with see the falacy of their product. I will continue to use the tape for the convenience of the way that it works and the efficiency of its design but the fault within the measurement system really should be fixed by the company."

This is nice, but just wasn't very effective for me. Too bad."
218335,0,"Muscle Tech Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite is aptly named. This product is NOT for people who want to lose weight and get fit. There are other products that can assist you in doing that without the 'hardcore' effect this one gives you.Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite is for people who are already fit, eating healthy stuff, and doing hard-charging workouts 3 to 6 times a week. It's for athletes and fitness minded folks who have no serious health issues, including cardiac issues such as high blood pressure, which may be made worse by taking this product. It's also not a product for kids or those individuals who are at all caffeine sensitive. It makes you feel weird and that may eliminate a whole host of folks who simply don't want to have that happen!IF you are a fit person; normal BMI (body mass index) which includes body fat and weight appropriate for your height and age, you MAY want to give this product a try. My suggestion is that if you are considering purchasing a bottle of this product on Amazon, go to the Muscle Tech website and look for it under Products. In the lower left you can request a free sample. Test driving it that way, will let you know if it's for you before you buy 100 capsules.Muscle Tech Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite is seen in all the bodybuilding magazines. A supplement filled with caffeine, the recommendations for dosage are to titrate up from 1 capsule on Day 1, to 2 capsules 1x on days 2 and 3, and then Day 4 onward for up to 8 weeks the recommendation is to take 2 pills, 2x's a day for a total of 4 a day.Frankly, that recommendation is astounding, as I think you'd appear like a gerbil on speed if you took that much, no matter what size you are!This product promises:1. Super-Thermogenesis (*I think that means you'll burn up whatever reserves of fat you have, but not sure.)2. Extreme Energy (*Off the charts with your heart pounding out of your chest if you're not careful.)3. Enhanced Focus (*Again with the 'speed' affect!)4. Effective Weight Loss (* You'll lose weight, but probably not safely.)My experience with Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite was mixed.I'm a fit female in her mid 40's - normal BMI, workout hard with weights (300 pound calf presses, pull-ups, sit-ups, bench press 100 pounds... not typical girl-stuff) 3 to 4 times per week with cardio as I feel like it. My goals are to maintain muscle gains, and to lose body fat. I also have fibromyalgia, which adds to my fatigue levels being somewhat high particularly on days I lift.Per the bottle's directions I took 1 capsule 30 to 60 minutes prior to one of my big meals of the day (breakfast). I noted a slight light headed feeling about 15 minutes after taking it, but nothing too strange. Prior to taking the pill I had one cup of coffee. I normally would consume 4-6 cups of coffee a day, but had decided that since I'd be taking this supplement I'd limit my intake the day prior and the day I took it.After breakfast I noted that I felt warm inside, but chilling - shivering actually - to the point of needing to put on a jacket. I assumed that since that's not normal for me, it must be the Hydroxycut. (This feeling continued intermittently throughout the days I took this product, which was a definite negative to me. I never did get to feeling 'hot', but cold - definitely!)My pulse rate went up about 25% over normal and I had an overwhelming urgency to defecate. This is not normal for me and the only thing I could imagine was happening is that the vaso dialating affect was kicking in throughout my body at that point. VERY strange, and tough to get to the gym!Once I could leave the house I grabbed some water (instructions for this product encourage at least 10 cups of water taken in addition to the capsules). I drink 6-10 twelve ounce bottles of water a day and so this wasn't an issue for me. Actually I wanted to flush it through as fast as possible as at that point, I saw only negatives to this product.At the gym I was still cold and a bit dizzy. My pulse was still elevated and I decided to hit the weights after knocking out push-ups. I noted no real change in my energy at this point, but I was warming up. I never did get super sweaty, but the chills abated for the duration of my workout.Lifting weights came easily and I noted an increase in focus that was a bit more than my usual pre-workout product:Optimum Nutrition Essential Amino Energy, Fruit Fusion, 30-Count, but with less 'pump' to my muscles. I did knock out a few more reps than usual with heavier weights, but was that because of the Hydroxycut? Who knows.By the end of my workout I still had good energy, felt focused and wasn't overheated. I didn't feel as bad as I had pre-workout, for which I was thankful! I had also drank water throughout my workout per my usual routine.Once home I had lunch. I had a slight headache prior to eating, but it went away afterwards. My appetite was unchanged.About two hours later I was craving a cup of coffee. A bad move. A few drinks into the cup of coffee I had a terrible headache and the chills were back. I had felt pretty good prior to that and can only guess that the addition of the caffeine into my already saturated system is what pushed me into that state. Very unpleasant!Hydroxyut Hardcore Elite contains: caffeine anhydrous (270mg), Coleus forskohlii (250mg), C. canephora robusta (200mg), L-theanine (100mg), Theobroma cacao (100mg) and Pausinystalia yohimbe (56.3mg). It's described by its makers as 'intense' and 'powerful'. I would agree on both counts.Is it for you? Only you know the answer, and if you need to find out get the free sample before you buy. You may find it helps you to meet your goals, or you may find it's just to 'hardcore' for your system.I can't imagine taking this at the recommended dosage. More than 1 capsule would have me climbing the walls and or being hauled off to a rubber room or the cardiac care unit of my local hospital. It's no joke - and should not be taken by anyone who has caffeine sensitivity or issues with their cardiovascular system.Some users report sleep disturbance while using it, I noticed no problem with it, taking 1 in the morning (about 6:30am).As for the claims you'll lose weight taking it - you would lose weight if you exercised and stuck to a low calorie diet, per the product's label - with or without this product. Maybe not as quickly as you'd not be revved up like you were about to run the Indy 500, but you'd lose weight if you ate a low calorie diet, exercised and drank more water. Anyone would lose weight if they did that, with or without a pill.Do I recommend this product?Yes and no.Yes, if you're a bodybuilder or fitness competitor who is looking for an additional boost to help you gain pre-contest definition and maintain your heavy workout schedule. Give it a try, but go get the free sample first before you buy.No, if you are anyone else who just wants to lose weight and do it quickly. ""Speed"" isn't what you need to attain weight loss goals, it's all about slow and steady work to get and maintain a healthy body. Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite isn't what you need. Try a good multivitamin, some CLA prior to meals, lots of water, frequent-sustained exercise that includes weight bearing ones to build fat burning muscle. You'll get there, just be persistent and committed to change.Maybe this product is for you if you're somewhere in between those two groups. But no matter what, try it out for free first to see if it's for you, and start slowly with 1 capsule. That may be all you need to assist you in your goals. 2, 3 or 4 capsules could hurt you. I know they would hurt me!"

The thicker or more curved the nails are, the more slowly you have to go, very slowly nibbling away at the nail edges that stick out. The jaws do not open far enough, which makes it very frustrating when trying to cut thicker or curved nails.

245653,0,"I purchased my very first electric - been shaving with Gillettes for 20+ years. I loved the look of this shaver, the sound, and especially the cleaning system. It shaved baby smooth on my cheeks, although I did have a little tingle for a few hours afterward. But it had a heck of a time on my neck - I am now learning that the hair on my neck grows in a swirl pattern. Nonetheless, I made too many passes over my neck - the shaver seemed to leave strays down there. It resulted in significant razor burn.I unfortunately returned the Syncro and purchsed a Norelco Spectra. What a difference. Its very close on the cheeks, but I don't believe AS close as the Syncro. But it does an outstanding job on the neck - no irritation. And VERY quiet (I thought it was defective at first.) I would suggest that if you have not yet pruchased this Syncro, then wait. Purchase the Spectra, try it out for 3 weeks. Then buy the Syncro and try it out for 3 weeks. (You have a 60 day money-back guarantee with the Norelco.) Then simply return the one of your choice. It's a little more out of pocket initially, but for something that we use every day and as important as many of us feel this is, it might be worth the experiment. I wish I had done it. But anyway, I am now happy with the Spectra, and happy that I don't have the hassle of normal razor shaving every morning."

They also tried to charge 7% for the return restocking fees but, I told them this is ridiculous and they eventually agreed telling me that since it is defective, they won't charge it.

385737,0,"I have been using it for a few weeks now and it keeps my body odor from offending others. Recently, I sweated through my t-shirt and my under-arms were visibly soaked, but I did not stink.I noticed that my underarms have to be thoroughly cleaned before rubbing the crystal stone on them, so I do so after taking a shower and using Dr. Bronner's soap, and while my underarms are still wet, before drying off with a towel. If I wait a little bit after the shower, and bacteria have a chance to thrive before putting the stick on, it will not protect.I am concerned that there is Alum in this product. I am concerned that aluminum atoms could escape from the molecule and be absorbed by the body, directly in to the lymph nodes that are located in the arm-pits. The notion that we ingest traces of aluminum every day, and therefore, any aluminum absorbed from the arm-pits is negligable is fallacy. Our intestinal lining is very selective. It rushes out poisons, in the form of diarrhea, and absorbes nutriants. The intestinal lining is inately intelligent and designed for this purpose. Human's were not designed to ingest selectively, foods or poisons, through their under-arms. Lymph node tissue is not the same as intestinal lining, therefore, to quote that it's unessissary to do an absorption analysis, based on the fact that we eat/drink aluminum every day, is misleading.Read [...] FAQ and see for yourself how misleading it is.

I loved it!I wore it for a couple of weeks, and the girls loved it too.After the couple of weeks, the smell became very nauseating to me (which rarely happens to me when I smell colognes).The vanilla scent is amazing, but there's something else that lingers with it that I find to be very repelling.It makes the fragrance smell like an old man... A REALLY OLD man! You know? The ""old people"" smell.Even my sister said it stinks to her.Anyway... Women really do love this cologne when it's on a guy.Maybe it's just my skin that brings out the ""old people"" smell in Le Male.I'll keep my bottle as a collector's item, but I'll NEVER waste another penny on this stuff again."
77070,0,"Okay, this machine is very loud even on the lowest volume. It works great but it is just too loud. I have to put it in the master bathroom and even set it on a washcloth to quiet the sound."
351397,1,"This product fits the bill for its recommended usage. It is very helpful, simple to use, just what they use in hospitals. Very user friendly."
224110,0,I purchased this in July 2012 and at first it worked ok and I ended up throwing it away last week. It has poor quality and maybe I should have invested more money in a shaver or tried another brand. I won't buy this again... I'll try another brand and spend a bit more than the $30 I spent on it.
190442,0,It's okay. It works. I don't know how long it will last. Every time I use it I hear it make cracking noises. I like the handle but the base is flimsy.
395186,1,"I love this product, even with the gripes. It does provide a good massage for the neck. I used it before and after my disc fusion surgery (once the fusion was complete, not before!) and it really is relaxing.My gripes are the plastic is uncomfortable to lay the head on (the plastic pillow thing isn't much help; a removable inlaid pad via velcro on the front would be better for use and for cleaning) and that it cannot be used in bed. Well, I did use it in bed and had no real problems with it, but they must say ""don't use it in bed"" for a good reason. (fire risk?) But the pros outweigh the cons and it is a surprisingly sturdy little device too (used it over a year now, no problems yet.)Especially at $30, it saves the cost of many trips to a massage therapist or mate who doesn't have the time to rub your neck (or vice-versa) either - though I do miss having a person to talk to... especially when money's tighter than my muscles. :("
104614,0,"I am having difficulty keeping it inflated, although I am on the high end of its preferred weight limits. It is also a bitduncomfortable since the surface is &#34;pebbled'. I would rate this item as adequate, at best."
266607,0,"First, allow me to preface my review by stating that prior to buying this shaver, I used Gillette's Mach3 razor for several years. I decided to try an electric to save time and to lessen the damage that shaving does to my neckline. I use my shaver before showering.The dry shave with this unit is slow: as slow as breaking out the shaving cream and getting it done the old-fashioned way. It has a difficult time with whorl areas of growth, but I imagine most shavers would. The shave is pretty good while not quite razor-quality, but it is less irritating to my skin and I consider it to be better than a razor shave overall.The cleaning unit is a waste of time and energy, and quite loud to boot. It seems designed to wear the shaver out as quickly as possible. After using the cleaning unit a few times, I now squirt a bit of handsoap onto the blades then run the shaver a minute until it foams through the grille mesh. Contrary to the propaganda included in the packaging, this is all the shaver needs to be cleaned. Panasonic's five-dollar soap solution is not some magic liquid whetstone.The battery life is good--about 10 days or so of once-daily use. The LED battery life indicators are worthless, as mine will stop running while the LEDs indicate medium battery life. I've never had the shaver stop because of low battery power while running; it will just refuse to come back on after it's been switched off, so I tend to finish my shave completely before turning the razor off.All taken in all, I am not terribly impressed with this shaver's value for the price. I think the head would need to provide a good shave for three years minimum before I would consider this to be a good buy.Edit: After about 3 months use, the shaver's charge now lasts only four days. I'm dissatisfied with this purchase.Edit, 6/25/2010: My Panasonic ES7056S now loses its charge after a day after somewhere around 100 charge cycles and I am looking for a new shaver. This battery (apparently NiCad?) is a disappointment to say the least. Two years of use for ~$80 is not a good value and I will not be buying another Panasonic shaver."

89303,0,"I bought this product in Oct from Amazon and only tried in about a week ago. I've worn them only 4 or 5 times and they worked okay the first few times but now do not stay up. Useless product and since I bought them awhile back but didn't wear them until now, I missed the return window. Amazon should make it easier to contact the manufacturer regarding defects in products they sell via their website.UPDATE: After reading more about the thigh highs, I realized that the problem was that my husband unwittingly put them in the dryer. I followed the cleaning instructions and washed the silicone part with woolite and thankfully today they stayed up fine. phew. was worried it was money down the drain. i also tried the jobst thigh highs that are the next level up as i was wanting a bit more compression but they didn't feel like they compressed much and felt bunchy around the back of the knees. at least these don't bunch in funny places.

This was a bummer as I had planned to give this as an X-mas gift and was not able since it was the wrong product. The Vitality toothbrush can be found at Kohl's and many drugstores. I ordered from this seller because I was expecting to get the 950TX. I already have a 950TX and am very pleased and this is why I requested this specific product. The seller did refund my payment after the product was returned. Would not order from this seller again as it seemed to be a bate & switch scenario.This review is more of the seller than the product itself which I very much like.The review options don't really cover this particular scenario in which I was shipped a product different from what I ordered."

380451,2,"I bought this 160GB External Hard Drive thinking it'd be a great addition to my system and allow me to store my MP3 collection (Tracks I've ripped from discs I own). I had over 26,000 files that I transferred over to my Maxtor drive the day I received it.It was easy to set up on my WinXP Pro machine using the Firewire option. It worked like a charm for less than a week. I then tried to reboot my machine after making some basic changes to it by adding new software which should have no impact on this Maxtor drive as it was installed on my main internal hard drive and didn't use any files from my Maxtor drive.Upon reboot, I opened up &quot;My Computer&quot; and was going to browse my G: Drive (The Maxtor 160GB External) and low and behold, the wonderful amber light comes on the front of the Maxtor drive.. I wait for it to go off thinking maybe it's just a temporary issue. About 30 minutes later, upon returning to my computer, I see that I have a G drive, but it is not able to be clicked due to an &quot;inpage operation&quot; error. I cannot retrieve files from this drive and don't even have the option to reformat the drive. The drive is DEAD!Luckily for me, I only stored mp3s on this drive.. I have the original CDs for these mp3s, so I can re-rip them and place them on a RELIABLE drive.. Do not trust any important file being placed on this drive if you are still willing to buy it after reading the amazon.com customer reviews.. You will be guaranteed to lose the file, have a horrible experience with Maxtor's website and customer service and will end up being stuck with a $225.00, blue and black, 5 pound paper weight."
253136,0,"As a tub side seat the sit 'n store is comfortable enough to sit on, but it's impossible to sit facing forward with my knees against the side of our garden tub and still be able to reach down to bathe my daughter. Sitting sideways is a little easier, but then I'm have to twist around which is rather uncomfortable. I even tried kneeling on it, but that puts a strain on my back. I usually end up standing and pushing the tub side seat away. If I could just find a comfortable way to use it during bathtime I would give it 5 stars because it functions so well in every other way.As a storage container it is spacious enough to hold all the pieces to my daughter's bath toys and it even has vents on the sides so air can circulate through.My 2-year-old loves using it as a step stool. It's light enough for her to move it on her own, but big enough to offer her plenty of room and it stays in place without sliding around while in use.I like the color of the blue lid, unfortunately it clashes with the color scheme of the bathroom, so I used Krylon spray paint for plastics to paint it a more neutral color. I usually store it in the cabinet under the sink, but if I happen to leave it out it blends in with the decor and it doesn't take up too much space.All in all I would recommend it. It's convienent for sitting while I dress my daughter and serves as a portable bath kit. Since she often attempts to run when she knows it's bathtime, having eveything in one place makes getting started much easier.Another use for it is as a toilet training step stool. Small children can rest their feet on it, and if you have a removable child toilet seat, depending on the size, you can store it inside here along with a box of flushable wipes and child hand soap."
126474,0,"I had a lady from the fragrance counter at Macy's spray some on one of those thin pieces of papers they give you.It was a pretty good smell but smelt too common. Sort of similar to bvlgari blv and hugo boss dark blue.And the scent only lasted strong on the piece of paper for about an hour.So I'd say this about it. If Macy's put it on clearance for about 20 dollars I'd buy it. As long as the shrink wrap wasn't or bottle wasn't damaged. I will not purchase from amazon. I'm seeing too many reviews about it being fake,average, and or not lasting long time."

My kids didn't like it because it would catch on theirs, but I didn't notice anything more painful than most when cutting my hair. The guard is a little large which made it hard to do some beard trimming in areas around my face specifically the chin area even at a low setting. It was nice to have so many lengths to choose from, but ultimately like other reviewers have pointed out, the guard is to flimsy and broke for me. Once the guard breaks its basically useless to have it lying around. It was worth it when it worked, but I wonder how much more I could have paid for something that would last longer."

The lube strip was virtually gone and I didn't get the great shave I had the first time I used it.3 shaves and I can tell a difference. Are you kidding me? No my beard isn't rough or super thick. But I'm not going to swap blades out every 3 or 5 days just for that great feeling of the 1st and 2nd shave.

The but is, that ""some hair"" will not grow back each time you use it, but it takes a long long time to stop every hair from growing back. If I had known it takes so long, I would've gotten an epilator sooner. I can't use an epilator on my under arms nor private area so I use Revitol on them. Now, if you leave it on your private area too long, it will burn. At least, it does for me. They changed the formulation about 4-5 months ago, and now I can't use it on my face, or it will leave red marks, that look & feel like burns, which I have to treat with neosporin.

36236,0,"All ACT Mouthrinses have .05% Sodium Flouride as their active ingredient. Fluoride disasociates into its ion form in the mouth and will bond with the tooth enamel forming a harder enamel crystal. Thus, it strenghtens enamel and makes teeth more resistant to decay. Studies show a reduction of 40% in kids who use this product daily, and a 71% reduction in root caries in older adults. So it makes sense to use a fluoridated mouthwash.This product is to be kept away from children under 6 who may inadvertantly drink the whole bottle, thus getting a case of fluoride toxicity in the process. These containers do come with a child-proof cap.The only ACT fluoride rinse that has alcohol in it is ACT Restoring Anti-cavity Mouthwash. The 11% alcohol content is added to kill bacteria. Keep alcohol products out of the reach of children due to the potential for alcohol abuse. I tend to avoid alcohol mouthrinses and prefer those that are non-alcohol. Alcohol is associated with tender oral tissues (dry) with chronic repeated use, and with unusually excessive use (many times per day), alcohol is a potential carcinogen.As a dentist, I recommend a 30 second to 1 minute rinse once per day, preferably at night before bed. If you have little or no cavities, this product is not really necessary. However, if you are one of those people who get cavites regularly or from time to time, this is a product that can save you the cost and trauma of going to the dentist to get a filling. Recommended for all kids ages 6 - 18, and for adults who still get decay. Again, choose an ACT fluoride that has no alcohol - it is better for the long-haul.Dr. Jim Koenig, DDS"

I was so disappointed because I was satisfied with how it shaved and very impressed with the battery life (which had been my complaint on previous electric razors). I often took this on vacation without the charger and it worked just fine. Maybe having it in a suitcase was too hard on the foil though. I was planning to find something else to try, but from what I've read it isn't all that uncommon to have foils go bad... but it is uncommon to have a nice close shave and a great battery. I'll think about it, and maybe I'll give it another chance.And yes, I now see that the replacement foils are available. Initially they were, but only through Remington directly I believe, and at a steep price (as much as a brand new razor- how wasteful!)"

387917,0,"It works, it is heavy so it seems good, but it takes a pretty long time to charge batteries. You can probably get away with a few hours for AA batteries but for anything larger than that, overnight is needed. I had a set of brand new AA batteries (did not come charged) so I charged them for the first time and I had to leave it overnight in that situation, too.For those of you buying the charger because you want to use rechargeable C or D batteries- did you know that the basic kind you'd buy at Walmart or Radio Shack have no more power than a AA battery? Look at the specs- you'll be surprised, I was. Essentially, these basic C and D's are nothing more than AA's in a larger sleeve!! (This is NOT true for the top of the line rechargeable C's and D's you can buy online at battery warehouses, and I don't think this is true for non-rechargeable, alkaline batteries). I had no idea until recently- otherwise, I wouldn't have even bought this charger. How you get around this is you can buy ""adapters""/""converters"" that are simple sleeves you slip your AA batteries into. Then, wa-la- you have C and D batteries, at a much lower cost (C and D rechargeables cost a LOT more than AA rechargeables). Search the web for a place to buy the converters- they are not carried in basic stores (or Radio Shack- the guy there didn't even know what I was talking about)."

They are extremely easy to use and very convenient. BUT... for women? The stiff back smooshes hair down at the sides of the head, and as my husband told me, it's not a good look. A more flexible rear band might be better. The other negative thing is that if I'm leaning my head against anything while wearing them (a pillow or arm of a sofa, for instance) the glasses are pushed off my nose and become useless. Again, a softer back band might solve this problem. So while they won't replace my tried and true often misplaced readers, they are definitely a positive and useful addition to my ""collection."""

It says to take before meals, but not how long to wait after taking the pill when you should intake food. I have gotten some slight stomach pains at times; that's taking it on an empty stomach. My weight is not melting off, I do work out 5-6 days a week with some bands work on equipment similar to Total Gym with the bands, and 30 minutes on an eliptical machine. I'm male, 5'9"" and around 168, 170ish and always had an athletic build. So I guess It may be work as far as me maintaining my weight, eventhough I would like to get at least in the 155 range."

I don't know if this is a defect or as a result of normal use. I am going to exchange it for a new one. I'll keep youi posted on the reliability of the new unit.Sincerely,Jack LeeYorktown Hts. NY"
17717,0,"I really enjoyed this trimmer while it lasted. I had to keep it plugged in, but it *really* cut through hair fast and efficiently. I'm only not using it now because the click knob to change hair length broke and the guide would no longer move up or down appropriately. One problem with the trimmer is it never was good at giving the 2 day stub look. Before I grew out a full beard I found this lack of a feature bothersome. As your beard get's closer to a size 3.5 this trimmer totally loses effectiveness -- I find the hairs near the chin to be substantially longer than the hairs on the cheek.For $7.00 more I'm going to order the HC-5550 this time around."

344031,1,"We've tried at least 5 other brands and this is one of the 2 best. We can take less of these than with other brands. It still works better and lasts the whole night.The price on this is awesome compared to others. The only other, really good brand we found is at Rite Aid. It is PharmAssure and it's almost $12 for 60 pills."
60179,1,"I ordered this Beesline Beeswax Dry Skin Ointment product recently. And as always, the service from Beesline and the product/s (ordered before) are excepional. Truly a miracle in skin care.Just as it stated -1. Beeswax Ointment suits the most sensitive skin [mine].2. It uses its beeswax and precious oils, its regenerating vitamins, and beta-carotene to protect your skin from external aggressions (dry weather, hot water, detergents). [Smells delicious].3.It healed my dryness and burn form the sun faster than other products claimed they did.THNAKS AGAIN BEESLINE."
260067,0,"I have to agree with another comment I read concerning how long the secure denture adhesive lasts, it does NOT last anywhere near as long as Fixodent. I'm trying to find a good adhesive without zinc, I do not care for zinc free poligrip. I will stick with the secure for a while, as I've purchased 2 tubes anyway, it seems to be a pretty good product and for me it lasts around 8 hours, compared to 12+ hours with the Fixodent. I'll guess I'll just have to use adhesive more often than I've been used to."
155563,1,"I buy this at my local health food store & my very fussy 12 year old, likes these!

303929,0,"The jar is 2/3 empty when received (well beyond what one could consider normal settling) and an average dinner spoon won't fit the opening. Unless you have a thin long handled teaspoon handy, scooping this powder out will be difficult. I also found that the powder seemed to have some sediment in it. Since D-Mannose should fully dissolve pretty easily, I was left wondering if those stubborn clumpy bits were some kind of filler. I also didn't experience the miracle cures some other reviewers have experienced, but I do think it helped somewhat. I will definitely try D-Mannose again, but I'll look for another brand."
166703,0,"Last year I acquired an Arcitec electric shaver from Norelco to replace my previous Norelco. I found I suddenly absolutely had to use a pre shave with this new shaver. To me, the regular Williams Lectric pre shave is too messy, although it works well. I did like, and used, their gel lotion but they apparently stopped manufacturing it. The Afta product is my fallback solution. It works, isn't as messy as the regular Williams, but it smells awful to me - kind of like the barbershops of the 50's, as I remember them."
407931,0,"This is a high quality, pricey product and very difficult to put on. Measured carefully before ordering, but it's so tight that it took 2 people to put it on and take it off. Would give it a higher rating if it was easy to put on."

Now I know everyone is different but, when I took these pills the made my chest hurt, I say it started a week after I started these pills. At first I thought it could have been something else, so I did my own little test. I stop taking them for two weeks and I was fine so I told myself I would start them again but when I did, again my chest started hurting so I had to stop taking them.I had success with the stacker 2 so I will be going back to those, one more thing you have to workout as well if you take them and just sit around the stacker products wont work."

52009,0,"I recommend doing your underarms first...(make sure you're sitting on the floor when you do this)...when you regain consciousness and go after the hair on your legs, the pain won't seem NEARLY as bad!! My armpits were swollen for two days! OUCH!Seriously, the jury is still out as to whether I'm going to keep on doing my underarm areas with this thing as I'm not sure I'll ever get used to the blinding pain. Not even with a glass of wine on board! But my legs are doing okay. Yes, the first time was a real ordeal, but subsequent maintenance (once a week) has been very quick and relatively painless.Overall, I don't think my legs are quite as smooth as they were with shaving...but, then again, I don't have stubble two days later, either so the pro outweighs the con. I suspect that some of my finer leg hairs are actually being broken off as opposed to pulled out as mentioned by an earlier reviewer. This is probably why my legs aren't quite as smooth as I wish. I do get bumps from ingrown hairs now and have to regularly exfoliate with a BufPuf sponge, but still, not a bad product.UPDATE - 8 June 2008 - I've been using this torture device for nearly a year now. I never did gather the courage to attempt to tackle my underarms again, but I did continue doing my legs on a regular basis. I was always plagued with ingrown hair bumps, especially around my ankles and knees and could never completely eliminate the problem even with exfoliation and regular sluffing with a BufPuf sponge. Also, I always had kind of a rough, stubbly feeling the entire length of my legs and I'm positive it was because my hairs were being broken off at skin level as opposed to being pulled out.So . . . I began to ask myself why on earth I was putting up with the pain of having my leg hairs pulled when I wasn't gaining the benefit of smooth, silky skin. I quit using the Silk-epil about six weeks ago and have resumed my regular shower dates with my razor. My ingrown hair bumps have disappeared and my legs couldn't be smoother and silkier. I use the Gillette Venus razor two to three times a week and couldn't be happier. Oh . . . the Silk-epil? I sold it on an online auction site!"
75526,0,"Luna Bars taste and smell like the stuff I use to feed my tropical fish i.e. some sort of nutrition blend disguised as bars (for my fish, flakes).

This does not speak to the quality of the product but more so my faulty heart rate monitor.
359837,2,"After tring this for one night I was a tad disappointed because after several hours it loses the coolness, however I am using it under the sheet, laying on it with my back to more evenly disperse the cooling feeling throughout. It is very comfortable to lay on, feels nice, and by the next night its ready to be used again. I have edited this review, I feel that my inital disappointment in the product was unfair, my expectations were very high, I regret rating this only 2 stars, I would give it a 4-5 now and would recommend this to others."

387515,1,"I love Swedish Bitters and have used it for years. If I remember to take at least 1 tsp. a day I do not get sick! If I forget for a few days I will often come down with an illness. It is a great preventative and also good if I feel I am coming down with something and take it right away.I take about 1 tsp and add water to it and chug it down like a shot. The taste is not very pleasant, but the benefits of this product are well worth it.If you can't tolerate the taste, try putting a drop or two of a high quality, food grade essential oil in it, like a mint or citrus flavor. I put a couple drops of grapefruit essential oil in it and it is fine.Also, using room temperature water can help keep the taste at bay. Cold water livens up the camphor.This is a great product and always on my shelf! I won't be without it."

I was pretty excited because of the organic ingredients in it but it hasn't been helping my scalp. I suds up my hair and let the product 'sit' for a minute but I wasn't able to feel the 'tingliness' that I usually get from tea tree products. I wonder if I got older bottles. My scalp has gotten worst, but I wouldn't blame it all on the product. It's so many different factors, including: climate- humidity, water temperature, and stress that makes my scalp go crazy.I've finished the two bottles now, would not buy again."

I would purchase from Walmart, or other retail store in the future,I only bought them from here because I had a gift certificate and shipping was free.

My mother used the concentrate to clean the floors and bathrooms and the spray came out every time a dog (or toddler) peed on the carpet, the garbage bag got changed, or if raw chicken was cooked she'd spray the counters. I can't find the original scent Lysol anywhere and I was thrilled to find this on a shelf at Walmart. The problem? It's not the right smell. Maybe I got a bad batch because all the reviews here say it's great but the stuff I got smells like iodine. I miss the old Lysol clean smell and it sucks now that I can't trust the ""original scent"" label anymore. I've bought the yellow/gold can of spray and it smelled right, but my mop water now smells like iodine, no matter how much I dilute it."

346172,1,"I just ordered this product about 2 weeks ago, and I'm very impressed with it so far. I'd tried the capsules, and the fish burps and just an all around fishy odor when I sweat really turned me off from it altogether.This stuff does have a lemony taste, not too overpowering, and you can slightly smell the fish in it if you try hard. I've put it in my homemade fruit smoothies with no problems at all. I use a lot of different fruits in it, so the lemony taste was not overpowering at all. Added a little hint of flavor to it actually.I've also tried it plain on a spoon. The taste isn't too bad, but it is hard to get past the thick ""oil"" consistency, at least for me. So, I just have some of my lemon water or coffee on hand as a ""chaser"" and it goes down easily with no problems.If you're looking for a product like this, I strongly recommend it."

So instead of returning it i will probably try to sand it down to make it smooth or we will just not even use it again."

When I first switched to this vitamin a few years ago I did not have any problems, but now I get a stomach ache every single morning which is a real drag. They must have changed something in their formula. After doing some research, it seems that the Iron content in the vitamin causes this problem for many people.

They seem to work fine. Don't have the full capacity as advertised but close (not 2,450 mAh, rather 2,122 mAh).Tried to format them with my computer charger (a computerized charger, not one of the cheap ones you can buy at every store), showed only minor improvement.

153716,0,It is interesting that most of the comments on this product regard the emu oil...when it is actually the MSM ( an odorless byproduct of DMSO)that is the most effective ingredient. Google MSM and you will see that there is no secret to it's effectiveness. The market is full of 'special blends' that are aimed at the people who are attracted to such. My girlfriend got me this and it works but not any better than the MSM I get at the farm store. MSM is the 'magic' in this stuff. I don't think I will be depending on the 'EMU' aspect much. (I hear 'green Emu' is just as good! or was that plaid Emu???? ha!)

285899,0,I have had to use Nyquil when I had really bad colds and the stuff really does work and gives you temporary relief so you can get some sleep at night but unfortunately the taste is really awful and mediciney and the so called cherry flavor really does not mask that flavor and I found that I had to mix this stuff with cola or juice and even then the mediciney taste over powered the juice and cola and I had a hard time getting this stuff down without gagging on the horrible taste so next time I ever get a bad cold I'm going to try the Nyquil liquicaps and since I can swallow those with a glass of water I should have no problems with them and at least I won't be sickened by a horrible icky taste!

134991,1,I have worked as a dental assistant and this water pik is the next best thing as going to the dentist. I wish it had a suction to extract the water from the mouth. It is a bit messy with water splatter and hard to use on your children. Due to so much water in their mouth. Great to use on yourself and I have taught my 12 year old with BRACES to use it. I am hoping this product will keep her teeth nice and shiny for when we remove the braces. It tends to get a bit high in price to buy all the extra tips for multiple family use. So coming with more tips would be nice. I like to different setting for pressure but wish it went a bit higher. It does not remove plaque or stains but is good for keeping plaque from building up.
266923,0,"I've used these test strips in the past. This is the first time I've purchased from this company. I used to use these type of pregnancy test strips to make sure our previous method was indeed preventing pregnancy in the past. It works in a pinch & is VERY inexpensive; especially for those of us who have the frequent desire to test or whom may have irregular menses. I've never had a positive as of yet, but it's always been clear about the negatives. Now that my husband and I are trying to conceive, I've purchased the ov test/preg test strip combo. I've used them for the past two months. I do like the preg test strips & feel they are effective (at least for -BHCG). I don't know if I feel positively about the ovulation test strips...I've never gotten a solid positive LH line. Some days are darker than others around my time of ovulation, one will be dark, the next light, then darker again...The line never gets as dark as the control line. I don't believe the test instructions that state if the test line isn't as dark as the control then it's not considered a positive LH surge (so if you do this every day and don't get a dark line, you wouldn't ever be ovulating?) I've used other brands in the past that were much easier to detect +LH surges & have had clear positives from them before. Other things indicate fetile period of ovulation; mittelschmerz, CM test, ultrasound follicle size etc. Try early-pregnancy-test . com They cost a little bit more, but they work! I'm convinced that there may be an issue with this batch of ovulation strips. My DH & I have been trying all month, so I'm not relying heavily on these strips. It would just have helped to zero in on 'prime time'. We've used these in conjunction with the pre-seed ""fertility friendly"" lubricant. Which I've heard rave reviews about!

The glue was very sticky, but I'm not sure if it was getting hot enough. I'm concern that I'l run out of cloths and sticks from just learning. This process can create a real mess. All solutions with the kit are real NICE!! I'll keep trying to use this kit, but have plenty of time work this..."

261437,0,Took this to help with sleep and depression as I was trying to avoid a prescrption drug. Seemed to work for a few months but then didn't notice much after that. Kind of felt like I did before taking it. Was not interested in increasing dose as that scares me. Stopped taking it because there was a possibly that it would interact with a med I was to start taking. Did not notice any withdrawl or adverse side effects from stopping it.

49564,0,"My cardiologist recommended resveratrol supplementation and I've been taking another brand. I've been happy with other Jarrow products, so I decided to give this a try. Unfortunately it has much less resveratrol (about 20% as much) than the other product I've been taking. This product seems to be a shotgun approach to cardiovascular health, with some resveratrol, green tea extract, quercetin, grape skin extract, grape seed extract, vitamin C, and trans-pterostibene. My cardiologist says that there's no hard data yet that resveratrol is the substance in red wine that provides heart health, but that's the present thinking. When the final data is in, it may turn out that the Jarrow product is better, but for now I would choose a product with more resveratrol. I also find it somewhat problematic that it has vitamin C and green tea extract in it, because I already cover those bases in other ways. I think Jarrow should choose another name (Cardiovascular/Antioxidant Blend?) and downplay the resveratrol, since it provides so little of that ingredient."

The part about the pain is true, although it was worse on day 1 and 2, and today I don't really feel any sensitivity any more, maybe I'm getting used to it. The strips are a PAIN to keep on though. You have to keep your mouth as still as possible, and they also make you salivate a lot more than usual which doesn't really help either. I also think they're too expensive but if you're looking for a wuick fix for your teeth then i do recommend it."

Right before thanksgiving I used this and I looked ten times work the whole thanksgiving break. It barley removed the hair and left my upper lip in burning pain and all red and blotchy for days. It's been a week and I have a huge nasty scab on my lip and I broke out a lot in this area. It's peely and dry and looks horrible even with makeup! WORST PRODUCT EVER.

I have taken tests using strips like these before, and tested with these strips the same way as those, so I assume it worked. After reviewing the ad again, there was a brief description, but stated that there would be instructions and illustrations included. There was not.These are straight forward enough to figure out if you have used these before. If you have not, I would avoid buying this without the detailed instructions.I have used 2 of the 5, and so far, those 2 have worked fine."

107452,2,I have a sensitive nose (both for smell and allergy). The smell from this product gave me a sinus-ache.It is not the lemongrass or fresh scent -- that scent disappears within 20min; it is a strong-lingering scent of warm plastic/wax.I bought a few different scents and they were the same. I threw them all away.I'm also sensitive to polyester clothes.I hope this helps.
230372,0,"As others have said, the product itself is a good idea but then reality rears its ugly head.Best way to use this product is applying it right before retiring for the day. There is a product called ""KANKA"" that is a viscous liquid, extremely sticky in its own right, and that's what I use to sort of ""prep"" the area before trying to apply these covers.I get the sore nice and coated with ""KANKA"", then place the cover onto the affected area. The ""KANKA"" product helps in gluing the Cover on, and then its off to bed. By morning, the Canker Cover has all but totally dissolved, and the sore is much improved.But applying it during the daytime is problematic at best. I've never had one stay on for more than 4 hours, and that's stretching it.Bottom line is you've got to tailor the thing for your own ergonomics, and that's what I did to help cure my mouth sores. Given half a chance they work, but getting there can be quite the battle.Good luck.PS: Amazon has Canker Cover and Canker Care+ confused with one another, but my review was for the CANKER COVER product."
350904,0,"I got my brace in and it provides pretty good support, I decided to keep it even though it doesn't have hinges (but it does have stableizers).

80544,2,"It's quiet, looks nice, battery indicator is a plus, but for $60+ dollars, this is a pretty weak shaver. The motor is just not strong enough, and it requires going over the same area a few times for a clean shave (which can cause some razor burns). If you have a lot of facial hair, don't get this model. I've purchased Philips/Norelco shavers ever since I had to shave, one every few years, and they're just getting weaker and weaker. I think it's time to switch to a Panasonic; pricey but worth the money for something that needs to be used all the time."
163365,0,"I was so excited to receive this in the mail. Little did I know it would take me weeks just to get the damn thing in. When I finally was able to insert in at the start of my next cycle I felt so accomplished...until my stomach started to hurt. At first I thought it was just my regular menstrual cramps, but as soon as I removed the cup the cramps immediately went away. Besides the cramps, I found out that I had been leaking the whole time. I tried inserting it again, but I still felt the cramps and I leaked even more. I ended up just buying some tampons. I guess maybe it was sitting too high up in my vagina, but I'm still pretty frustrated considering I spent quite a bit on this thing."

I have found that an hour after taking one stacker 3 I am ready to go. The product has not help me lose weight, but it does give me enough energy to exercise and work around the house for a few hours. I have also found that it also increases my oxygen level. I have zero side effects from this product as others have stated. Maybe if I took a stacker 3 and did not stay active I might have some side effects, but I always drink about 18 oz. of water after taking one stacker 3 and then I stay physically busy for about 2-3 hours. For me this is a great product and it does exactly what I want it too.Brock"
153357,0,"Pros: The lather on this stuff is incredible. As full-bodied and creamy as anything I've ever encountered, requires very little on the brush and whips into a robust lather extremely quickly. Allows for a very close shave.Cons: The smell is overwhelming and the cream causes irritation/razor burn. Of course, each person's mileage may vary according to the sensitivity of his skin, but I can only review a product based on my own experience of it. I was very disappointed to feel a dry, burning sensation during the shave and some noticeable razor burn afterwards. From what I understand, this appears to be a problem more with the Sandalwood-scented Taylor than with TOBS in general.If you have hardy skin and very tolerant olfactory nerves, give this cream a try. Otherwise, there are gentler scents and formulations out there."

17796,0,"I only do vitamins and supplements to make the wife happy. She tells me the best way to get your vitamins these days is in liquid form. So these Gels were suppose to be a compromise, liquid form but no stinky/bad aftertaste. I think the problem with mine is that maybe one of the Gels broke in the container or on the packing line cause they smell 10 times worse than regular hard multi-vitamins with that unique mineral/vitamin type odor and when you look in the bottle it does have a yellow tinge to it. This one is my fault, but if you can learn from reading and not trying yourself then this might help you, don't ever bite down on one of these things!!! They will pop with very little pressure and taste really nasty."
371533,0,"I really like this product. It does exactly what I want it to do. However, the brush isn't as nice as the brushes on the bigger models and the soap tank leaks. I just squeeze the trigger and dispense the amount of soap that I want and then release the tank so it stops flowing until I want to dispense some more. Overall it does the job."
262278,0,I have purchased this particular massager twice and am looking to replace it. I have had 2 different models of this same wand in different color variations/different packaging over the years and am disappointed to say that only the colors and packaging have changed. There are numerous problems with the cord and head on this device. The electrical cord tends to split easily exposing the wires inside and shortly before or after the head slows down vibrating (similar to the way a battery operated model would when the batteries were low) and then soon after won't turn on at all. This is a wall outlet model.I contemplated purchasing a third because of how well it works when it does work but I have decided to try another model that may have fewer problems. It's a bit pricey to have to replace every few months.Bottom line is if you have the money to spend every three to four months then go ahead and buy it because it works well for that time frame. If you are looking to invest $50+ ONCE and have something that will last you a few years or more consider something else entirely.
276671,1,Just like other Syntha-6: tasty flavor and good result on my body! Really like these products and its reasonable price.

65179,0,"I purchased this particular model by researching online. It is dependable 75% of the time. I generally can retrieve an accurate blood pressure calculation on my right arm but have not been successful on my left arm. I even took the machine to my doctors office to have the nurse try it. She wasn't able to do it either. You have to keep your arm very still during monitoring and preferably on a flat hard surface, as they recommend. It can be frustrating at times when the error buttom keeps turning up. I found it is just best to skip it and go back later and check it out. This is my first blood pressure machine so I have nothing else to compare it with. Also I would recommend getting a machine with the heart rate monitor as this model is equipped with. I can unplug the unit (batteries will save info and still take reading) and take into the doctors office and she can pull up all my previous readings while in the office. Also take the machine with you each time you visit the doctor and take a reading to make sure it is accurate with the nurses reading."
102432,2,"This monitor is off by at least 30. My BP is shown constantly normal using the monitor, but every visit to doctor office, or even the free BP monitors at drug stores telling total different stories. Some folks said it might be the proper way to use, e.g. relax hand, sit still with back supported, support front arm with heart level...etc etc. I believe I attempted the best possible position to use the monitor according to its manual, but the readings are still way off from reality. I do NOT recommend anyone to use it."
350433,2,"Within two uses the wrap started leaking rice from the poorly constructed seams. Also it really smells like fish when you heat it up in the microwave. Our microwave is new so it wasn't a smell that the wrap picked up, it was a smell that came from within it that got released with the heat. The heat makes your neck/back feel better, but the smell makes you nauseous. I wish I had not purchased this, my father had one for years and it was great, sadly the quality has clearly declined."
259096,1,"I have had this Wahl clipper kit for a couple of months, and simply stated, everything in the kit works extremely well. And the kit is very inexpensive. A great value for the home barber.The 120V clippers are hefty. They are solidly built, sharp and powerful enough for a thick beard. The battery powered clippers are much better than I would have ever bet before I owned them. They are serious, powerful clippers. It should be noted that the clipper guide combs only fit the 120V clippers. There are no guide combs for the battery clippers, but they are made for trimming, not hair cutting. Also, the 2 AA batteries go in a little weird, one has to be put all the way in the bottom of the battery compartment before the other one goes in off to the side but on top of the other battery.Both clippers work extremely well, but the consumer friendly details of the kit make this an exceptional value.This set is packaged in a re-useable, plastic, foam padded box with a plastic latch that REALLY IS big enough to hold all of the parts included in the kit. No more messing with a cheap, torn, (and flimsy) cardboard box. Also, the clipper oil is not not in a plastic bubble pouch, it is in a small, screw top squeeze bottle. You actually can use the oil more than once, it doesn't leak out all over the box during storage. You can actually lubricate the clippers more than once which should make them cut well for years.These are quality clippers and the kit is a great value. This Wahl clipper kit is made for the long haul; powerful, sharp clippers and a kit that was made for years of home use."

So everytime I had to change her diaper I wouldn't have to go all the way upstairs to change it. In my new place I only have one floor so I though that I wasn't going to used but I found the perfect spot: It attaches to the hamper!! right next to the single bed that I used to change her diapers so I don't leave her by her own. And it keeps everything organize, the only problem is if I don't have too many dirty clothes in her hamper and the diaper deapot is full it starts going forward. But be creative and maybe you can find somewhere else to attach it too."

45988,0,You should always replace the foil and blades at the same time. especialy if the blades and foil are over due for a change. The old blades and foil wear unevenly together so the shave you get from them are fair to say the least. If you only replace the blades you are putting straight blades on an uneven foil which is worse than the old bades and foil.
119145,0,It was a much larger item than I was use too. What it is made of had a loud smell. I wiped it in vinegar to get the smell to go away.

They are so much cheaper than the kits and tests in stores, and I can't believe I ever bought anything else."
343588,2,"I am assuming this cleanser doesn't make my face squeaky clean because its purpose is not to dry my face out. So I don't want to say this product is bad. But I just don't understand it. Once I am done washing with this product, I have faint raccoon eyes. After that when I use a cotton pad with toner and swipe my face, I am left with smudges of makeup from the day.Maybe this is the way I'm supposed to use it? The product doesn't warn me about it nor does it tell me I have to wash my face twice preferably with another cleanser. Currently that's what I am doing.I am trying to find an organic product without parabens that really works well as a cleanser. I am wondering if this is the best organic products can do without using harmful ingredients."
293255,0,"I have been a razor guy my whole life. I have been wanting to try an electric razor, especially a wet/dry one, for years now. I tried this Panasonic after it received a good rating in Consumer Reports this spring (well, not THIS model, but one nearly like it). I gave it 3 weeks hoping that my face would eventually get used to it. It worked fairly well with shaving cream, but never quite shaved me close enough. My beard grows flat on my face, making it hard for the razor to pick up and shave. Several times I would look in the mirror and see a single hair that didn't get cut at all. In the end I wound up putting it in the drawer and pulling out the old trusty razor.On the one hand I don't feel bad because it was not too expensive to experiment with, but somehow I think that if I had bought a more expensive brand I would have had better results."

I asked some fellow parents for recomendations and I got great ones for this tub so I bought it. It totally secures baby so I can use both hands to bathe her, which I feel is more safe. Plus, as an added bonus, she loved it! She kicked and splashed for half an hour. It makes the bath enjoyable for her because she can move around while being safe."

82104,0,The taste wasn't the greatest. It tends to leave an aftertaste. I found the bar to be extremely chewy but dry. I didn't notice any changes in energy levels either. The bar is ok for a quick bite when on the road with the kids to hold you over. I don't believe it's what the package says it is.
14803,2,"For several thousand years it has been known that the breath can be used to calm the mind and nervous system. Dr. Erik Peper the internationally famous biofeedback expert says:""There are NO absolute respiration values; range varies with the individual. Respiration is a continually changing homeostatic system. Pathology may be induced by forcing the system to match normative standards such as breathing at a fixed pace or volume. The breathing rhythm needs to be dynamically adapted and varied for each personEmwave and StressEraser do not allow for that breath variation and can cause increased tension instead of less. As far as the HearthMath Cut Through technique that is a Red Herring to create a marketing hook. Remember the KISS principle - keep it simple - diaphragm and reduced breathing is free- simple to learn - totally portable and is the core of HRV training.When you are watching a screen performance anxiety is a high possibility - also once you learn to meditate you can access the quiet stillness where the bodies wisdom resides. Technology blocks this important benefit."
391645,0,My teeth hurt so bad that I want to cry. I can just feel the throbbing pain at the edge of each tooth. I can't even drink without a straw because any amount of cold on my teeth is excrutiatingly painful.I have used the whitening strips for 5 days worth now. I took 2 days off because of the pain and used 1 strip this evening and now my teeth are hurting so badly.If you can tolerate pain then go for it because they work. But if you can't I suggest steering clear of these. I am going to discontinue use of them and get my money back. I just can't take the pain anymore. It feels like my never endings are exposed.
98316,2,"....but you really are wasting your money on this product. I bought it several months ago and while it would occasionally work it took an absurd amount of time for any results, and even then the results were uneven. I just bought a Panasonic and couldn't believe the difference: the results were instantaneous and outstanding. It made me realize what a piece of crap the Conair is. You could sit there for 45 minutes and still get zero results. Unbelievable. I would give it no stars if that was an option."

I've only been using Progesterone for 2 weeks now and the past few nights I've been sleeping better than I have in a long time, when this close to my period. My true rating is 3.5 stars. My complaint (and it feels like a big one to me) is that one full pump is a heaping 1/2 teaspoon (I measured it). If you ever try to rub that much lotion into your body all the once, you'll see that it's a lot, especially out of a shower on a cold morning & the cream feels cold on the skin. I did some math and figured that it has approx. 175mg of progesterone per oz. Most creams have 450mg, reason why you have to use so much. It's concetration is too low. I'm going to try Progesta-Eze (bummer that Amazon doesn't have it), but I might be back to BioEntopic."

After a few emails back and forth, we completed the impressions. After sending them in we got our molds back in about 10 days. The product has worked well and we are happy with the results so far. A suggestion to smilemedic is to have all the instructions sent with their products or list everything on a web-site so a custumer can download this information for themselves."

88226,1,"I got the Safety First 4-in-1 bath station and hated it!!! It leaked water, the sling smelled after 2 uses (even washed it), baby continuously slid down, and it wouldn't stay put. I then bought the safer bather (it was delivered on Tues. bought it online Sun. evening)and used it tonight. My baby always loved bath time even though it was awkward for me, but now it is AWESOME. She splashed more than ever and stayed put. It even allowed her to sit up better and splash with her hands. It stays warm, the baby can stay comfortable, mom can relax and enjoy giving the bath. The only thing my other tub is good for is housing the Safer Bather cushion so I guess I won't throw it away yet. It is so comfortable for sitting up, reclining, and even standing on when getting out of the tub. It is much safer than anything I have tried. It really is a great buy! Thank you!"

378392,0,I got this tub at my baby shower and I was thrilled. It leaked all over my counter the first time i used it. I've tried everything to keep it from leaking but there is nothing you can do. I started using it in the tub but its really a hassle. The suction cups work a little too good. The sling part is slippery and he is constantly sliding down. Also the sides are very hard and make his arms all red. I recommend just using like a sponge type padding that you can just lay on the bottom of your bath tub until the baby is old enough to sit up.
39139,0,"The machine itself is of very good quality and would deserve the attachments to be of a similar standard instead of the cheap rabbishy plastic made in China that don't even fit properly at times.

It almost makes me gag. I'll be going with Nutiva next time."
224460,2,"This shaver is a joke. The rotating head really serves no function. There is a plastic roller between the two blades which makes the levels between them uneven and gives you a very stubbly shave instead of a clean smooth one. You have to go over and over the same section and you still can't get rid of the stubble. Charge doenst last long inspite of what they claim. I have started holding the shaver rotated so taht its dorsal side faces teh skin ( the opposite of the natural ergonomic position to hold), coz that gives me a slightly less stubbly shave. I will be happy when this shaver conks off so I can buy a new one without feeling too guilty of buying a new shaver so soon! Hate it!"

Agreed, it is a quiet unassertive mascara, so if you're looking for the big guns, this ain't it."
149242,0,"I have been looking for an effective hair thickening shampoo for a long while and purchased both shampoo and conditioner. Both have not been used long enough to determine if they work or not. Because this shampoo doesn't lather well initially, there is a tendency to use much more than needed. It will lather as it's worked in but I didn't like the scent. So, if a little goes a long way, it may be worth buying for the price. I'll give it more time."

49684,1,"I have had Soapy Soles for over one year now. I have had seven leg surgeries, including knee replacement. This product is an absolute dream. Just stick it to the bottom of your tub, wet it, pour a little liquid soap(body wash soap)and while you are showering, just rub your foot over the soapy soles. They work up a rich lather which works up between you toes. You can turn your feet at different angles to get the sides and heels of your feet.The Soapy Soles are and absolute pleasure and they massage your feet.If you are handicapped, no someone who is or have any problem bathing, whether on a bath bench or standing in a shower.......when you can't reach your feet....Soapy Soles does the trick. I highly recommned them."

It arrived promptly and was easy to install - but, it definitely wiggles and since our parent is heavy - it makes her nervous. She makes sure she hangs onto her regular grab bar when getting up."

There is a slope where the water from the holding tank to the part where it puts the water in the air, is too shallow so water doesn't flow. If you prop the orange on one side so the slope is greater, than you won't have an issue. I still continue to use it."

395510,0,"We got this to groom our standard poodles, thinking it would make it easier to clean up.ProsIt fits correctly on the clipperIt is not particularly hard to remove/applyIt collects all the hair wellConsIt makes the actual grooming harder, because it pulls the hair up, causing the cut to be much shorter, causing razor burns. (Not too huge a deal, our dog usually fine with a #15, with this a #10 would be more apprpriate)Majorly it is hard to use in that it is too bulky to cut delicate areas, such as the feet and face ( this was on two st poodles 80lb and 60lbs, the bigger one has rather large feet and even so the clipper was too awkward for the delicate manouvers)So in order to get all the little hairs on the feet and get around their eyes and boundary lines (lines where their cuts end) we had to unscrew the vac and clip without it; which basically defeats the purpose.That said it was good for getting the bulk of the hair, but for fine work you need to remove it."

Who knows ... maybe the vibrator is really made for a kitty cat and not a person. It is very cute and the recipients liked it and the idea but never tried them out yet. (that I know of)I will upgrade my rating after or if the vibrators ever get used. They do have a novelty appeal factor to the Hello Kitty fans. It'll be fans that tell me how they like them. Obviously from the looks of the style and size and the fact this is a Hello Kitty item this is strictly a novelty item, which is what I actually bought this for. This was meant as a surprise joke gift to a Hello Kitty fanatic."

305837,2,"I give it a 5 stars for the taste and a 1 star for the 8 grams of saturated fat. Unless you are young with a high metabolism or do lots of cardio, muscles milk will make you fatter and clog your arteries after many years of taking this product. Your longterm health is more important than building muscles now. if you take this 3 times a day, that is 24 grams of Saturated fat. Saturated fat raises your cholesterol and cholesterol clogs arteries which causes stroke and heart attacks. You might as well eat dominos pizza 3 times a day. Pizza's high in saturated fat and protein just like this powder. I recommend Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold. It has 1/16th of the saturated fat. THe downside is it doesn't taste as good as Muscle Milk. M M tastes damn good. Optimum Nutrition has a cheaper price per serving. The choice is yours. If I were 18 again I would probably go with M M, but now I'm 33 and more mature so I worry about more than just getting big muscles."

281429,0,"I have been using this epilator for 5 years and it never made me troubles. It is still working absolutely identical to the first day.It hearts epilating sometimes, but not very much.I purchased it in Russia, so it was 220 V. Now I moved in US and for this reason got another one (Braun 5270 Silk-&eacute;pil X'elle Body System Epilator). So now I can compare.This one is more painful, comparing to the Braun.And it takes very long time. I did it usually ones in 2 - 4 weeks, and it was like the whole evening for the legs and underarms. I know that if you do it more often it takes less time, but with this product it is definitely more than 1 hour any time (usually it is 2-5 hours), so it was hard to made myself using it. I never have plenty of time, so it was the reason why I was combining it with shaving. (epilate and after 2-3 weeks start shaving before using it next time).It has 2 speeds. I would call them 1) Very slow and 2) Slow. If it had the 3-rd ""normal to fast"" speed, I would give it 4 stars. But it hasn't.But! I found that for underarms and some parts of bikini area (for all extremely sensitive parts with high density of hairs per sqare area) it performs better than Braun because of it slow speed. It becomes more delicate and less painful. (If you ask me about the Braun epilator I'd say it doesn't have a normal speed as well. It has 1) rather fast and 2) very fast.)I don't recommend to buy it for bikini particular, though. Still hard to do, should be something better in our world. I purchased Emjoi EpiSlim (cosmetic hair remover for delicate areas and touch-ups) but I didn't try it yet.And do not even think to use normal epilators (like this one and others) for your face! This is the worst idea ever! That should be something special, particularly for face. Otherwise you will look like a shaving man.It is not this product problem, but just a wrong usage.This is not very expencive and it works, at least. Not bad, I think."
69645,0,"About a week after I started taking this product I noticed that just one of my toes started itching like I had been bitten by a mosquito. It was so intense I couldn't sleep. I tried every product I could think of to stop the itching, but the toe just kept getting worse. I then noticed what I thought were blisters, but they were not filled with liquid. I also noticed that after taking a bath or shower the itching became unbearable. My toe then started to swell up, and turned purple. I had started another vitamin at the same time and thought maybe it had to be one of these vitamins that was causing the problem. So, after more than a month of suffering I stopped taking the Maitake. About 1 week later my toe stopped itching and the swelling and redness started to disappear. I must have had a fungal infection. I don't blame the product itself, but I'm sorry that I won't get to enjoy the benefits this product is said to give. I love mushrooms and eat them all the time, so the thought never entered my head that I might have any allergy to Maitake."

425225,0,"It does the job but not very elegantly. The Velcro is old school Velcro instead of the more modern micro Velcro you can find on other braces. Its probably one of the better braces on Amazon, but not better than the Futuro brand at my local CVS. And for less money. The heat activation thing really just makes me sweat and thus makes the brace smell pretty fast. Instead of one or two well placed bits of Velcro, it has four. Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way. I wish I'd just gone to my local CVS and got the Futuro to begin with because thats what I use now. I can't for the life of me find it online, but this blog has a photo of it. [...]"

For around 13 bucks, what you find inside is not fantastic, but it is OK. A cold press, burn ointment, gauze, bandages of various sizes, wooden-stem swabs, plastic tweezers, lots of disinfectant wipes, and animal stickers.I found it hard to open the first time trying to press the tab with the arrows on it. What you need to do is to hold the handles and pull them apart. I found closing it a bit harder as you need to align the tabs together and push."

171852,0,"I tried all sorts of nose hair trimmers before purchasing these. I've had 4 different electric trimmers which, I am now convinced, are all a waste of money. there is no such thing as a good electric trimmer. I also tried the Groom Mate Platinum cylindrical manual trimmer, which did trim hairs, but not at all closely. Groom Mate left nearly 1/4"" of each hair, if it trimmed, at all. Cheap, drug store, blunt tipped scissors out-performed all of the above. Rubis boasts a surgical craftsmanship far beyond any other nose scissors or trimmer that I have found. The big problem with the Rubis scissors is how thick they are. Amazon does not provide a close-up image of the blade tips, which are more than 1/8 inch thick. So, while these scissors will cut the thickest and the most fine of hairs, my drug-store cheap scissors trimmed the hair nearer to the skin. The cheap drug store versions loosened up to uselessness within a few weeks, but they had flat blades and didn't cost thirty dollars. I'm still looking for the perfect scissors. I recommend the Rubis scissors only to people with thick old-man hair growing like a bush from the nose and ears. It should be perfect for that. Trim your bushy eyebrows with it. However, someone with fine, metro, personal grooming should get something cheaper with a flat tip. Amazon was great."
142024,0,"I haven't had this particular stool as long as some who've encountered the rust issue, but I have already noticed the push stops are made of a material that is causing them to corrode a bit and it's already becoming less easy to re-adjust the leg lengths.

For the price, I wasn't expecting anything too impressive, and for the price they weren't probably expecting to get impressive feedback either. So I'll go with the 3-star ""it's okay"" rating because it's thus far the dimensions and features I wanted... and the price I was happy with."

The only problem is that it doesn't dissolve at least as easily as the previous Whey Protein that I had. In general, I am satisfied with it."
283818,2,Andis are supposed to be cream of the crop products but in my experience they're not. I've had two Pivot Pro (each one lasted about one year) and after the second one's blade actually broke I decided to get a different one. The clerk at Sally Beauty Supply recommended the Styliner II so I got that one. It has been a nightmare ever since. My wife trims my head every 2 weeks with it and she needs to adjust the calibration screw 4 or 5 times during the cut. It's just so annoying. It's also a little rough on the skin and just doesn't do the job too well in the end.I may have gotten a defective unit but I didn't return it to the store in time so I'm stuck with it. Still 0 out of 3 Andis machines is enough for me to move to a different brand so I ordered myself a Wahl Peanut to see how it does.

It would be easier, but I paid a pretty penny for this thing, so I'm going to use it!Yes, it will pull the hair out of your legs, but it is a very tedious process that involves going back over the same spot many times, even after exfoliating.As far as the ouch factor....legs - not badbikini/underarms - badanywhere else - moderatly bad to bad.It's not so much that it doesn't work, but the money, effort and pain are just not worth it.

300392,1,This product works well for the price. I used it all the time for my upper lip before I started to wax. Now I use it to trim my eyebrows and it works well. Sometimes the pieces come apart(for you to clean not broken) if your not careful but they go back together easily. There might be better ones out there but it did the job for a decent price.
346043,0,"I ordered and even subscribed to Carlson's cod liver oil based on its reputation. It is said to be, and I don't disagree, the best omega-3 source on the market. However, this particular product, 150 1000mg capsules, is not something I am ordering again. First of all, this listing didn't make clear that the 1000mg describes the size of the pill, not the omega-3 content. That is only 230mg. Secondly, and more troublingly, the contents of the other 770 grams of fat are not disclosed. They may be saturated, which I wouldn't mind but others might, or they could be omega-6, which I certainly would mind. I suspect they are saturated and monounsaturated, which is to say unproblematic for me, but it'd still be nice to have more clarity.The pricing is deceptive: on the face of it, this seems to be the cheapest Carlson's package one can get, but a serving is 5 pills, not 1, and those five pills are equivalent to 1 teaspoon of actual product from the liquid form. The overall price difference is 33.00 for 100 doses for the liquid (.33 dollars) vs. 13 for 30 of the pills (.43 dollars) vs. 13 for 150 (which is the perceived price, based off of the data given, 8 cents per dose). As a college student who lives primarily off of rice and milk, the perceived difference is what made me go for this product.What I'm saying is that this is a good product, be aware that it is more expensive than it appears."

424392,0,"I was introduced to this product because my grandparents were told by their doctor to get a machine so they could monitor their own blood pressures. When the got this particular machine, they called me to come over and make sure they were using it correctly since I am in the medical field.The machine itself was pretty easy to understand what to do and the directions were pretty clear. The only problem I had was that the bulb that you have to inflate proved to be extremely difficult for my grandparents to use because of the arthritis in their hands. This meant that either I had to take it or my grandmother had to inflate the cuff with one hand while the cuff was placed on the other arm. This posed her with some questions about the reliability of the readings.While this may seem like a pretty simple machine to operate, if you have any hand problems, this is probably not the machine for you."
39780,1,I have used the Lemon scent furniture products for many years. Now that I live in Florida the constant humid heat is hard on real wood furniture. My oak Lion Head/Foot table was drying out. Now I keep it clean and oiled with a faint Orange scent. I like the scent but I appreciate how it keeps my table looking new. Stopped the warping caused by the humid heat and fights that bit of sea in the air along the Treasure Coast.
129168,1,I'v used this product for over 12 years and I am convinced that it has helped me avoid a second hip replacement. I'm just sorry I had not known of it sooner because it might have negated the need for my first and only hip replacement
122211,0,"Adequate for the task it was built for and the price. I've owned other ""Sonicare"" toothbrushes & this was a replacement. I did notice that the brush heads on this new model are smaller. Probably a cost saving measure, but I believe, a dumb move. Also, the light flashes while charging. This can be really anoying at night in the dark. However, the travel case is a plus. Overall, a strong three to weak four star rating."
167703,0,"I purchased this razor based on the reviews I read. I noted that one woman complained about irritation and welts, and that another woman said her husband claimed that the woman experienced irritation because she pressed down too hard with the razor. That husband doesn't know what he's talking about.I tried my new razor on my underarms using almost NO pressure. The irritation was horrible, and I was left with red welts. Bravely, I used it on my legs. I had no irritation whatsoever on my legs, and got a very nice shave.The underarm irritation lasted over a week. Once the irritation was gone, I tried the razor again. (I thought that maybe the irritation came because it was the very first use of the razor. Also, the instructions say that it takes three uses for your skin to get used to the razor.)Unfortunately, I again experienced irritation. It was not as bad as the first time, but was present for over a week.I don't know if eventually the razor will stop irritating my underarms or not, but I am disappointed in the product. I have owned electric razors in the past (dating back to the 1970's) and have never experienced irritation like this with a new razor. This is the first electric razor I have purchased in at least a decade.I gave it three stars because it does shave nicely on my legs (and even the bikini area - if you are gentle and careful), but I really needed it for my underarms (the hair grows faster and is more obvious there.)I hope this review helps you make an informed choice.-Donna >&lt;>Update: I have used this razor several times on my underarms, and it is not getting any better. It pinches and ""bites"". I would never have purchased this razor if I had known that I could not shave my underarms with it."

With that said, I'm finding it very difficult to locate a replacement screen & foil for the little shaver that comes with it. The trimmers are sharp enough but, the length adjustment keeps slipping and thus cuts my hair to short. I like that it's rechargable not a battery you have to replace affter every shave."

It turned the milk green, and it tasted nothing like Vanilla, even with a bunch of Hershey's syrup in it. The percent daily values of the shake are great, but it is hard to get a heaping 1/4 cup of it down every day. I am going to stick to Viactiv."

233152,1,Great product! Performs beautifully and whitens teeth. I would recommend this product to anyone. You cannot beat the price for excellent results.
346003,0,As a previous owner of two health food stores I would say this is an excellent product for the money. My biggest compliant however is that it uses galatin instead of veggie caps. It amazes me that many in the health don't understand how important this element is to many consumers. I will look for alternatives unless this product changes it's capsules.
80102,0,"I am overall pretty satisfied with the shaver. I have to admit my former blade gave the smoothest shave but I love the convenience of this one and the ease of the self-cleaning option. I was a little surprised when the 'charge' light blinked constantly despite the booklet indicating this meant a charge was needed. A call to the Remington people informed me it was a misprint in the booklet and blinking actually meant it was fully charged while steady light meant a charge was needed. A little confusing but these things happen I guess. All-in-all, I would buy this again and Amazon's price was great."

180541,0,"This tea is just ok. Not offensive, but it doesn't really have much taste. I was really surprised when I first drank it. I think the best way I can describe the taste is starchy. Like if you cooked white rice in water for a while but then dumped out the rice and just drank the water. Not much of a ""taste"" but just kind of a starchy flavor. I guess this herb is supposed to help clean your liver but who can really say how much benefit it's having? I don't have any specific liver problems, but I just like to try a variety of different herbal formulations to get the benefits of items that don't get consumed in the normal daily diet. I drink herbal tea for health but also as a tasty beverage. I probably won't get this one again, I'll probably move on to some other herb next. There are a million out there and it's nice to mix them up and expose yourself to a variety of different ones to help your overall health. But they have to be a more of a standout to make it into my regular rotation. This one didn't really make the cut. Sorry, Milk Thistle!"

This scope may be good for seeing a possible object obstructing the ear or if the ear is red but I wouldn't rely on it to tell if my girl has an ear infection. I'm going to look around for a better one myself. But on the plus side it's better than nothing and she loves to play doctor with it.

82327,0,"I think these function similar to carb gels with one exception: you have to chew them. I find that they stick to my teeth (which I hate, no matter what type of food I'm eating). I have only used them prior to a workout, not during. I found that they are fine to use before a workout. However, if I had to chew them while trying to stay on pace during a run I don't think I'd like it (it's too much effort when you are trying to push yourself during a workout). In addition, I think they would be good to use if I were cycling instead of running because I'm able to chew more easily while cycling.In short, I give the Clif Shot Bloks 3 out 5 stars because you have to chew them. I think they taste good but they seem unnecessary given that you can simply buy a carb gel and not worry about chewing anything."

In contrast with other capsules I have purchased before, these are much softer so i guess the enteric coat is much thinner in these capsules, and ok theres no fishy smell but a strong artificial strawberry smell. I have burps (which I didnt have with the other capsules) but instead of fishy it feels like i had strawberry soda almost all day. The worst part is that is a 240 capsula pk, so i guess i will have to stand it..."
371134,0,"We have had the Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner by Marpac (formerly known as the Sleepmate/Sound Screen 980A)for years and love the sound that it generates, I just wish it could be louder! So I bought this one after seeing other reviews that this could actually be LOUD! I am not that interested in any of the other sounds it makes, just the white noise for sleeping. And the volume control does let it get very loud! However, as with any sound machine that uses a recording and is not actually generating the sound itself, there is a distinguishable loop... I had hoped this model would be different somehow, and although I am noticing the loop now, I am hoping to become used to over time.... But for anyone with a sensitivity to picking up the break in the loop, this might not be the best product. Also, the white noise from this one is a bit shriller than I am used to with the the Sound Screen 980A.... but I am hoping to get used to that too. The Sound Screen 980A actually produces the sound itself, so there is no loop! And the tone can also be adjusted, which is very nice. If only the sound could be made louder, it would really be the perfect product. We'll see how this one works out for the next few weeks, but it might be back to the Sound Screen for me."

281516,0,"Really high quallity of materials used to make the holster. That being said...... only 2 bottles make for a lot of swapping out products creating a lot of wasted product, in my state we can't merry our product back the the bulk container. Finding other bottles that fit the holsters and match the 2 that came with it is difficult. Lastly the belt portion is very thin and causes some skin irritation even when worn over denim as it needs to be tight enough to stay in place when pumping the bottles and is too thin to go in belt loops with out causing the top of your pants to curl. It souldn't go through belt loops because its awkward to take your whole belt off when you leave your table to use the bathroom or go to the waiting room.All and all I think it could be better, it could be worse but it could be much better. For about 20 bucks I had expected a higher quality belt, but nobody seems to make one they are pretty much all the same cheap packing strap.If the manufacturer reads this I have a few ideas for them that I can't believe they didn't think of. a 2.5inch cotton belt (like a boy scout belt or the belts that come in cargo pants at old navy) would look more professional and be more comfortable. I would use a different belt myself but the loops on the holsters are too small to really use a different belt, so I guess I am saying make the loops on the holster itself larger as well. The holsters them selves are the best quallity I've ever seen oil washes out with out leaving any ""dots"". Maybe a zipper or velcrow or buttons on the loops so they could attatch to a different belt. I'de pay 15$ a piece for that! You caqn contact me by responding to this review.This review is kind of disjointed because the product really hits both ends of the spectrum exeptional to awfull.Holster - amazinbg designbottles - needs to come with more bottles so all my equiptment will match or at lease make them available at a reasonable price after all they are just packaging.Belt - cheap and uncomfortable very bad quallity and not at all professional looking. All the design seems to have gone in to the holster and comfort of the oil bottles and none to the comfort of the therapist.if it had a better belt or even just larger loops on the holsters so I could use my own belts I'd say a bargain at twice the price, with the current belt and availablility o matching bottles I feel a bit ripped off."

It's most comfortable if you use water that is body temperature - then there is no feeling of inhaling sea water or other unpleasant sensation. -Follow up note: this neti pot had absolutely no damage after being hurled onto a tile floor by my toddler, aka Dr Destructo."

226851,1,"Lets face it, the people and the planet are exposed to way too much multiple chemical combination load. Most people think their body eliminates these when they pee and poo, UNTRUE. Planet dishwashing soap is the only product for asthmatics, chemically sensitive and children and the only dishwashing product I will use. It is the only product I can tolerate. If you think about how your skin and lungs absorb the standard over the counter brands, which are not regulated for safety, and multiply that by days and years of your life, that chemical burden to your body is extensive and cumulative. Triclosan, the touted miracle antibacterial, found in many of these, is found in breast milk. Not a gift to give to your baby's brain! You are NOT eliminating it, you are accumulating it in your tissues! And, it is NOT antibacterial, it mutates the bacteria and creates superbugs which are harder to eliminate from your environment. (PS to save on sponges, boil them and re-use them!Decrease your chemical load and the planets chemcial load by using Planet.It does not take more to clean my dishes with Planet. I even dilute it to save product and expense.In addition, their laundry detergent removes environmental toxins including pesticides and toxic unregulated fragrances from all your clothing! (cotton is the most heavily pesticided crop in the world!)"
275093,0,"I've been using the shaver for a little over 3 months now. It's very quiet, the charge lasts a couple of weeks, but the shaver takes 3 to 4 swipes over a 1-day growth stubble to fully cut it to a somewhat smooth level. The sideburn trimmer is useless - have to use a razor there. Also have to use a razor for errant neck hairs. All in all, not bad but not great."
119576,1,"at first my 6 y.o. was not too keen on taking these vitamins due to the flavor, which I find extremely pleasant.He now takes them without complaint because he says he knows it is good for him, he feels better and likes that he does not have those ""purple streaks"" under his eyes anymore, (doctor thinks possibly from zinc deficiency). I especially like that he was not as sick this past winter and we only had one trip to the doctor."
57062,0,"I have bruised ribs and needed to stabilize them for travel. This fits around me but like the one reviewer said, you would have to have very small or close-together breasts for it to fit, let alone be comfortable. It rolls over under in the front and would not work with any fitted shirt. If it only fit around the breast area, it would provide nice support. It is better than nothing but only for brief periods and probably not in public."

SO I SAID FINE LET GO TRY IT OUT AND OMG I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT WAS AMMMMMAAAAAAZZZZZING!!!! WE ALSO GOT ANOTHER PRODUCT BECAUSE I DIDNT JUST WONT THIS TYPE OF VIBRATOR I WANTED TO ALSO HAVE A SLIM ONE.

40383,0,"To review a product like this is not a simple thumbs-up / thumbs-down matter. Product effectiveness can and will vary between different people. The ingredients contained are all reasonably acceptable for human consumption (as the manufacturer suggests, always consult your doctor first).When I have felt under the weather I have taken Echinacea with satisfactory results. Quick Defense should give the same results. The manufacturer seems straighforward with their ingredients list and directions, making no wild claims. That is good reason to choose one brand over another.Will Quick Defense be right for you? Again, consult a doctor to be sure there are no conflicts with other medications you take or conditions you have that would suggest you don't take this supplement, and then make your informed decision to buy it or not."

57893,0,I saw a lot of reviews containing horsetail for hair growth i just ordered me a bottle so i will have to give it some time to work as people have said it takes time to see results.

275109,0,"I bought one of these and was very happy with it for quite a while (maybe a year or two.) But lately it seems to take forever to get shaved, and when I finally give up, I'm not happy with the result. Sure, blades get dull and all that, but this seems to have happened very quickly compared to previous Norelcos I've owned. I wonder if Philips is joining the stampede of manufacturers going for cheap and substandard? I've just bought a replacement Norelco, and if this one goes the same route, after 20-30 years of Norelcos, it's on to some other model of shaver!"

41832,0,"I've been using the Oral B Triumph for a few months now. I've probably had half a dozen electric toothbrushes over the years. It does a good job. It is a little heavier and more wieldy than most, but nothing near enough to keep me from buying it again. I really like how it gives a short buzz after each 30 seconds, alerting me to move on to the next quadrant, and a longer buzz after two minutes.What I don't like is that this is by far the messiest toothbrush I've ever owned. For the first time in my life I have occasional little projectile bits of toothpaste/saliva flying out of my mouth. Not attractive. And I inevitably have to wipe a few of them out of my long dark hair when I'm done. And I've learned the hard way not to put on a dark colored shirt before I brush my teeth. Yuck. Even more annoying is that the brush and handle are hard to keep clean. Prior to this, I always just rinsed my toothbrush then gave the handle a quick swipe with a handtowel. Never had any problems. This one, even when I take extra care to wipe it, still leaves little toothpaste rings on the counter and toothpaste trails down the handle. Gross.Overall, it's a great toothbrush but quite frankly, so are most electric toothbrushes except the real cheapos. Would I pay an extra $50 again just to be reminded to switch quadrants every 30 seconds? Probably not. I'd rather have a clean sink. :-)"
77664,0,"Here you see three stars in my rating. If I hated it, I'd give it one, and if I love it, it would have five.You'll read a number of five star reviews raving about this product, and how it cancels out the noise in the area. This is a great exaggeration, and I believe the desire to love a thing that has set someone back $50 motivates one to leave an embellished review.Allow me to explain my predicament. My roommate has a freeloading boyfriend whose contributions to the household may be that he does cook very well. What problems I do have are too many to list here (and not at all relevant) but chief among them are his ability to annoy the heck out of me with his acoustic and electrical guitar playing, his use of the amplifiers at night, and my roommate's insistence that I simply deal with it.I found this solution to ASSIST my calm at night. As others have said, and as it has advertised, this sound conditioner produces a white noise of its own. It is not high pitched, nor is it in any case annoying, so please take note of that. What it is lacking is the ability to effectively repress the sound of the boyfriend's guitar. At best, it may drown out some of the noise IF you were to sleep with it on a nightstand less than a foot away from your ear. If not, you will likely get nothing out of it.The best I CAN and will say about the Marpac Dohm DS is that it is very soothing when there is no bothersome noise, and if you are having problems sleeping even in a somewhat quiet environment, this conditioner will greatly assist you. The sound it produces it something comparable to a strong wind through a tunnel, which I think emulates a winter atmosphere.In the long and short of it, buy this if you have trouble with people OUTSIDE of your building who play in the streets or like to have arguments in their driveways, but if you have an issue with loud noise inside of your household, you may want to look somewhere else."

(My pain management doctor judges how well his treatments are working by how mottled my skin looks from too much heat.) In the past, I always bought Sunbeam, because it was the only brand available in my semi-rural area. With Sunbeam, I went through at least three heating pads a year. Last time, I found and purchased this SoftHeat model. I didn't expect it to be any better than Sumbeam, but it was a couple of dollars cheaper and worth a try. I have been very pleasantly surprised. First, I like the push-button control better than Sunbeam's slider, but most of all, I like how long it has lasted -- almost a year before I wore it out. My only complaint is with heating pads in general: Why doesn't someone make a heating pad that will last for years rather than just a few months? Is it because they can't or because they know chronic pain sufferers like me will pay as often as we must for a little relief?"
350165,0,"If you read the back of this bottle it has you start off taking one capsule twice a day and slowly increasing the amount until you are up to 4-6 a day and having 2 ""formed"" bowel movements per day. It does indeed do this. Having said that, I don't believe this is a way to lose some ""real"" weight as in excess fat. I do believe it is a good way to flatten out your mid section a little bit before an event where you need to stuff yourself into a tight dress for instance.This might be a good alternative to the green tea detox for people who can't handle it. There are lots of green/herbal teas for sale which are labled as ""detox"" or ""dieters tea"". These have a laxative effect and can cause you to cramp up and run for the toilet. The super cleanse tablets seem to be gentler."

Unfortunately, the images provided are so small that the type on the boxes and bars shown cannot be read. The labels and packaging are the same for the two sizes of bar; it's the unreadable type that distinguishes them. If I hadn't purchased this brand of bar many times before this, but never before from Amazon, I might have read the description given on Amazon's page and seen the difference. But since I was thoroughly familiar with the brand, I just looked at the images. Now I have snacks instead of meal replacements, for almost the same price as the larger bars sold elsewhere.

86922,0,"I wanted a moist heating pad that was like the one I used many years ago and lasted for years. Though this may be among the best in the market place, it doesn't fulfill my needs and was returned. The reason is that the instructions state that you can't lay on it and if you do, it won't be able to generate the moisture needed (which is by chemical means). If I was able to lay on my stomach, I feel certain that this unit would be able to provide me with the comfort and relief I need. I since have learned that most, if not all, heating pads warn against laying on them for fear of the user falling asleep. If there isn't a timed automatic cut-off, it could result in severe burns, especially if the heating pad remains on a high setting for an extended period. That seems to be a liability issue that has little to do with laying on most heating pads."

223212,0,"This is the first electric shaver I've used, so I can't compare it to others...but I can compare it to regular razors. I've used this model for about a year, and it's sold me on using electic razors over regular razors (which I used for over 30 years).The shave is very smooth, but it takes a long time on my beard. I have to go over the same spots many times. It takes me about 15 minutes to really do a good job. I don't know if a rotary, or higher-priced foil, razor would speed this up. Maybe my beard is heavier than most, or I'm too picky, or I need a heavier-duty shaver (this one seems rather light-weight). Or, for all I know, it takes everyone 15 minutes to shave with an electric razor. I just don't know. But once I'm done, my face and neck are quite smooth.The rechargable battery lasts a long time, and it recharges very quickly. The smaller size of the shaver is handy. I agree that the trimmer is useless, but I don't really need it anyway (I use a smaller hair trimmer for that).I'll search for one that works quicker, but I'm quite glad someone gave this to me last Christmas so that I could investigate using electric razors. Quite happy with it."

And I live in Okinawa, Japan where EVERYTHING is one of those three things (and I do mean everything).Anyway it was a pretty good warmer for 11 months but it recently stopped working.

321809,0,"I purchased this mat a year ago. It has done the job very well for me. I didn't have an odor problem at all. My only problems are the thickness and length. I have been doing yoga for a year. I am 5'8"" and this mat is impossible to do some poses without having to step off the mat somehow. I feel like my arms or legs are always off of the mat. It is also a very thin mat. I have sensitive joints and this mat makes certain poses painful to do and I have to modify them or double up my mat with one of the extras in the room. If you're not too tall and don't have joint problems then this mat is perfect. I think as I get more into yoga I have seen that I need more from the mat than what I am getting. I wouldn't go into yoga for the first time with a higher quality mat unless you know for sure you will continue. This is a good mat to start with though if you're not sure about yoga. It is low cost and serves the purpose. It can get a little slippery for your hands or feet but it doesn't bother me too much. I just keep a towel near my mat to dry off my hands. Keep in mind this mat is only 68"" long (I am upgrading to a 72"" inch mat). So if you are doing poses that require spreading out more then expect your feet or hands to be off the mat."

4043,0,"I keep a beard and mustache, so I just need a shaver to ""shape"" my facial hair. Trying to neaten the mustache with 3 blades is not really a viable option. So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested. The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power. That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you've ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your shaver), you'll come to appreciate that gillette's blades can last a very long time. The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful. I'd like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can't without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution. That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.Gillette probably hates customers like me. I use a cartridge for up to 6 months without replacement. Partly because I don't shave everyday (when you have a beard, skip a day and it's not really obvious). I'm still on the first cartridge so I can't tell how dull it's become compared to a new cartridge, but I still have no problems shaving (and it's 4 months now). Maybe I'll update this review when I change my first cartridge. :)Update: I've changed cartridge/blades but only because the old blades look worn, but with the power on, it shaves as well as the new blade."

266424,0,"I bought this pack when we were trying to concieve our last baby. It was a cheap multi pack which is what I needed. I used several that turned out to be negative, but when I finally was pregnant, it took quite a while for the pregnant line to show up and it was very faint at first. I took one and it looked negative, so I throw it away. Then I knew I had to be pregnant, so I took another one and it still looked negative. So I set that one aside and took another one. About 20 min later, I saw a really faint line and looked at the one I previously took and there was a definate line. So you just have to give them a long time to work (which is torture when you want to know) So they work fine, just slow."

5974,0,"The diastolic pressure seems consistent, but the systolic (higher number) changes by 20mg or more between two readings taking one right after the other. Also found similarly dramatic differences when switching from one arm to the other. Good to give you an idea of where you are, but I wouldn't rely on it for very accurate one-time readings, particularly with the systolic.Also note, if you get a wrist monitor, it's important to hold your wrist at chest level - it will be falsely low if it's above your heart and falsely high if it's below your heart.I bought the wrist monitor to save some money, but just spent a few extra dollars to replace it with an arm cuff one."
261896,0,"Concise: I purchased 3 packs of these 900 mAh NiMH AAA batteries by Sony. All 12 batteries behave similarly, but none of the 12 come close to 900 mAh. The average is 690 mAh, with the minimum being 634 mAh and the maximum being 732 mAh.Detail: For my testing, I used two battery analyzers, both Powerex MAHA MHC9000. All batteries weee used on each analyzer in turn. Before any battery usage, all batteries were put through the new battery conditioning routine, using the slowest possible charge and discharge rates (200 mAh charge, 100 mAh discharge) with the analyzer set to the batteries advertised capacity, 900 mAh. This routine took days to complete. After this, each battery was discharged (slow rate). The mAh ratings was recorded for each battery. Following this, each battery was charged (slow rate), allowed to rest for 24 hours and then discharged (slow rate). This cycle was done three times for each battery.Results: After initial break-in and initial discharge, the batteries averaged 678 mAh, low 534 mAh, high 711 mAh. After the second discharge: average 685 mAh, low 632 mAh, high 734 mAh. After the third discharge: average 686 mAh, low 634 mAh, high 732 mAh.Conclusion: Typical, but disappointing. These batteries range from actual capacity of 70% of advertised to 81% of advertised. In real-world usage (3 batteries used in my GPS Photo Tracker), the batteries behaved far inferior to Costco Kirkland brand AAA batteries (the really cheap ones). Said another way, my photo tracker turned itself off after less than 8 hours of use, 3 separate times."
162835,1,Came to Santa Fe for a workshop and was just completely out of it tired for several days. I noticed ads for O2 treatment for Altitude Sickness. I thought I'd save myself money by just buying an O2 enhancing supplement and came across Cell Food. In no time flat it knocked out my fatigue and my mind was crystal clear.I have discovered other uses for it including fighting against infections which will come in handy as I do my best to avoid antibiotics unless absolutely necessary. In any case I heartily recommend this product which have a multitude of uses much beyond what I have used it for so far.

The biggest difference is it only has a memory of 30 blood pressure readings. Otherwise it seems to work fine. For $29.99 I was expecting a basic machine..and that is what I got, so I cannot complain. I think this listing should be updated to reflect the actual one being recieved. though."

118918,1,"I'm so grateful for several features on this thermometer: the small line on the tip that shows you how far to insert it, the flexible end, the light up display and the FAST reading. Taking a rectal temp on a squirmy baby is no walk in the park, and even 4 seconds can feel like a lifetime! The fold up feature is actually quite handy - it's not much more ""compact"" than the unfolded thermometer, but when your baby gets his hands on the thing you've been sticking up his butt, you'll be sure glad the ""business"" end is tucked away (even if you do sanitize it every time - moms, you know what I mean)!As for accuracy, I have no complaints.

I'm not overweight but am a medical professonal and wanted to know more about this so called ""cure."" To start off, on his infomercial, he never gives any clue as to what his approach entails. All I heard was a bunch of vague statements that made doctors and pharmaceutical companies a part of some huge conspiracy to mislead overweight and obese patients. I went through his book and there are only a handful of pages in the entire book that address his claims and give actual details about this ""cure."" In a nutshell, this approach entails taking hormone shots along with a diet that includes exotic teas and foods. Not very practical! No medical professional in their right judgement would or should endorse this type of program to lose a modest amount of weight. It's amazing that he is allowed to make these claims.

276931,0,"It's certainly one of the best tasting products out there, but the scoop is large... about twice the size of what a normal protein scoops is.

398905,2,"I purchased an older relative of this shaver 3 years ago, impressed with the whole faster motor thing. It performed extremely well, as I used it almost exclusively wet in the shower.About a year ago, the older model started conking out and after some research, I decided to once again go for the panasonic linear 13000 engine.This time, it took only 4 months for a breakdown to occur. The shaver went completely dead one day. After negotiating Panasonic's immature site for service support, I was directed to send it off to San Francisco for repair under warranty. Two weeks later, when checking for status, I was told I should have sent to to Connecticut. Three weeks later, they needed to order parts. Expected delivery in 5 weeks.Bottom line: Excellent shaver when it works. But reliability is a big concern as Panasonic contines to struggle with the battery power and the electronics inside. Service is well below market standards for such a large company."
370771,0,"I purchase replacement blades for my Panasonic Vortex shaver. Prior to replacing the blades, there was a decline in the effectiveness of the Shaver that required shaving the same areas over and over again to get an acceptable shave. Even after replacing the blades and micro screen, the Shaver's effectiveness falls short of the original standard.I have used this Shaver for about 4 years now. It simply is not comparable to a Norelco, although the clean-up offers many advantages. You can simply pop off the top, brush it off and rinse it under water, towel it off, and let it air dry. The Norelco required disassembly of the unit head, and removal of each cutter from its screen to clean. So, the trade off for using the Panasonic is that it takes longer to shave in the morning, and the shave itself falls well short of the Norelco.As far as the vendor who sold me the replacement blade goes, I can recommend this vendor. The replacement blades shipped within 48 hours of the placement of the order. The item was new in a blister. No fault with this vendor, who did everything right. So, 100% recommendation for the Amazon vendor.Panasonic may make a great radio, but the shavers remind me of American cars in the 1970s. They were also very easy to keep clean."

387875,0,"I read all the reviews and since the majority were positive, I ordered this charger. However, I have the same problem as the one who gave it only 2 stars due to the charging lights going out ahead of time. I have been charging AAA batteries and the lights only stay on a couple of hours. If I move them around the lights come on again for awhile. Next time I look they are out again. Since these are brand new batteries, I know they don't have much charge, if any in them, and know they should at least take overnight.The main problem is that the batteries (at least the AAA) don't seat in there very securely. I am hoping that the larger ones will stay more secure and not give me this problem.I did give it 3 stars because it is a good price, nice size and can do the Ni-MH batteries as well as the cadium. I wanted this so I could charge my phone batteries and be able to use the phone without having to charge in the phone for 20-24 hours.Before buying, just read all reviews so that you know what you are getting."

189745,0,"My sister-in-law has an old version of this product & loved it. We both have plantar fasciitis.What I don't like:#1 The top wrap does NOT conform to the shape of a human leg unless your leg is the same circumference around your ankle as it is just below the calf of the leg. No matter how I wrap it, it is big at the bottom & barely meets at the top of the wrap.#2 The finishing tape sewed on the edges of the fabric causes it to curl inward a bit. Since the tape reinforces the edges, they feel constricting on the upper part of my leg and even though I don't wrap it tightly, it leaves a crease in my skin where I have laid.#3 In order to have my foot stay in a 90 degree angle all night, I would have to wrap the upper wrap tightly, which it won't do; tight at the top does not make it tight at the bottom of this upper wrap.#4 Your foot still slips around in the boot, it just can't be tightened enough b/c it does not conform to the shape of a human leg.What I do like:#1 It is so comfortable to sleep in#2 It has helped the plantar fascitis; I have much less pain when stepping into my orthotic shoes & walking first thing in the morning.

380851,0,We have a couple of Swiffer wet jets at work that we use for small cleaning jobs around the store. It really does work well and I was amazed at how much dirt it really traps! But the cleaning pad fills up quickly depending on how dirty the surface area you are cleaning is (very dirty at work.) So you might have to change it at least once while mopping. Would recommend it for a larger kitchen or tiled area. Wouldn't really recommend it for a very small space (overkill) or a very large area. Good for medium sized jobs and spot mopping.

34262,0,"I purchased this produce base on Amazon's great review. I've used up 2 tubes, on my 3rd one, disappointed and became desperate for other options.Few months ago, my ""area"" flared up due to sitting too long on the stool plus bad constipation. It was really uncomfortable to walk around (no pain, just discomfort, so I don't think a ""roid"" yet, but it's in early development stage). I applied this product on right after I got it. It was the greatest feeling ever because it cooled the area down immediately. First day 3 applicants, next morning, my bowl movement were a piece of cake and the flare calmed down. I continued using it for the next few days and noticed that I ""got to go"" every morning, which was great. I stopped after a week because the flare was gone. Warning: the fragrant was unbearable; you can smell it in your dream ""yuk"". I was really embarrassed wearing that fragrant with me all day at work.When I was 28 weeks pregnant, I had developed 2 raisin size ""roid"" on top of the plum size flare. It was just extremely painful and so uncomfortable. I couldn't walk straight nor sat still. I applied this product on, more than 8 times per day, the cooling sensation helped with the pain but it didn't shrink the ""roid"". 1st tube was empty, and I abused the second tube due to its ""cool"" feeling, using more than 8 times per day. Started the 3rd tube in a short period of time. This 3rd tube has no to little cooling sensation, the fragrant was very light to none. I used it for one day, applied almost every 30 mins, the pain was still unbearable, I couldn't take it any more so I did the following: 5-10 mins sitz bath ($10 amazon) with Epsom salt ($2 Wal-Mart), equate hem suppositories ($5 Wal-Mart), TN Dickinson witch hazel wipes ($6walmart), witch hazel liquid ($3 Wal-Mart), and fiber advance gummies ($10 Wal-Mart), acetaminophen (100 count @ 500mg/count Wal-Mart) + this Mayinglong Musk which I squeezed every drop of it out from the 2nd tube which I dug up from the garbage bin, this one gave me back the cooling sensation which numbed the area temporary... Next morning, (which is today) ""I had Dr appointment"". The flare calmed, the pain was reduced, 1 of the ""roid"" was reduced in size as well, still painful but not as extreme as yesterday. Dr said from now until delivery, I might have to deal with the ""roid"" as it is really common during 3rd trimester pregnancy and the most important thing is the ""sitz"" bath.My conclusion is that this is a great product if you are at the early stage of developing ""roid"", once you have the ""roid"", this alone won't help. I personally think the suppositories + liquid witch hazel (using cotton ball) + sitz bath with Epsom salt + acetamophen + Mayinglong Musk would definitely a must. Liquid witch hazel is better because it contains 85% witch hazel, where as the wipes contain only 50%. With this Mayinglong Musk - hopefully you get the ""working"" tube, not like the 3rd one from the package I received. I gave it a 3 because it only helped during the early ""roid"" stage, bad fragrant, and one ouf of 3 tubes I received was bad."

353290,0,"I brought my first GSR-2 unit in 2001 and another one in Feb 2011. I love to use for 30mins to another on some days. It does help me relax at the time when I am using the GSR-2 unit. I have to be honest here, I use it for a day or two then stop for months or even years. So, I am not a religious user of GSR like some folks are. I can relax when I am using the gsr unit, however, I find the relaxation effect does not last. Of course, the effects from tranquilizers do not last either. That is why you have to take a new dose every few hours. Fair enough, however, the effects from tranquilizers are effective in real life situations. For example, You take xanax because you have anxiety attacks in public places. The effect from xanax will subdued your anxiety(while you are in public places)for as long as the drug chemicals are in effect in your body. The GSR-2 effect is not like that. I notice I can relax while I am using it. However, when I am in a stressful situation and I am not using the gsr unit, I can not apply the relaxation effects. Perhaps, I am not using it correctly or long enough. This is where the limitations of applicability/applying the effects separate psych drugs and biofeedbacks like GSR-2 units. The effects from drugs are automatic and the chemicals forced the effects onto your body. With Biofeedback like GSR-2, you have apply the effects of the unit onto your body or brain. The thing is, you use biofeedback because your body or brain isn't working well... In other words, you might not be able to effect the changes on your brain or body because either or both will not cooporate....After I have said all of the above, I do think the GSR-2 unit is worth buying. It's important to develop your own plans for using this device, since the enclosed instructions may not work for you. It's also important to know what exactly do you plan to acommplished with this device, and be realistic about your goals. Sometimes, drugs or doctors might save you time and money in the long run. GSR-2 gives you feedback of only one psychobio response, which is your level of nervous tension. It shows you what is your nervous tension at the moment, you might be able to change it by lowering it at the time. You might not be able to lower it during stressful situation when you are not using the GSR unit. It's well known when people become stressful their hand skin temps go down and their heart beats go up. However, most folks can not successfully control their heart rates or hand skin temps during stressful situations... the same might apply for GSR for you as well.. Good luck to you folks who do buy this device. I hope you will have better luck with it than I. take care."

Super sharp, felt good in my hands and was easy to use. Then about two days ago, i was using the knife to try and pop open my problematic patio door. (wood door w/wood jam) and before i had even put five pounds of pressure on the knife to pop the door open, the very tip of the knife broke off. Only about 1 or 2 mm actually broke off...but seriously? This is supposed to be D2 steel made by a great knife company and before i had even begun to apply any kind of pressure...the tip breaks off. Very disappointed in this highly regarded knife."

118961,0,"I was pretty happy to get these batteries (I use them in my Turtle beach X32 wireless headphones) and at first they worked great, but it's been about a good three weeks since I've had them now, and after about a combined 6-8 hours of use, they seem to die, I don't really mind that they die so quick since I only use two at a time and I have them charging, but normal batteries last longer then that, just regular everyday AAA's I could get about 4 or 5 days use out of them until they died, but these won't last more then 2 days, just seems like the more you charge them the less they keep, they are fine for a temporary fix, but if you plan on having these batteries for an extended period of time with continuous use, you will be disappointed in it's performance."

22195,0,"I go through lunch boxes like these a lot. So throwing them away doesn't break my heart. My wife has a tendency to leave them at work with food in them and the box gets the foul stench inbeded in it almost impossible to get out. So to the trash it goes. What I noticed with these is after one or two uses the lids were not fitting on. The product it self only has a few uses regardless any carelessness. These are still too expensive for only getting a few good uses out of. Considering these are hand washed, and have not been in a dishwasher dry cycle I never imagined the lids to warp as the did."
370161,1,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Zi8I , 600mg a tablet for only 5 cents, additional with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies have identified red yeast rice as a beneficial supplement for maintaining a healthy balance of cholesterol and related lipids in the body. Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!"

355920,2,I had a severe sprain from playing hoops and was unable to walk for 2 weeks and I am still suffering 3 months later. Doctor said 1 more month of therapy. I was hoping this brace would reduce the pain as compared to my aircast and allow me to do more. I don't think that is the purpose of the brace (reducing pain when moving). To me it seems a mild way to brace up ankle and prevent rollovers--- Next time i would want something with a much tighter wrap around the ankle.

120259,0,"I bought the Duro-Med Relax-a-Bac for my husband to use in his pickup truck. He travels on business and drives hundreds of miles each week which causes lower back strain. We found this product works well if used with a office chair or computer chair, but is too bulky and cumbersome when used in the pickup. Here's the problem. The Duro-Med is designed with small ""wings"" on the sides. The seats in the pickup truck also have this design, so that when you put the two together it makes the cushion stick out in an uncomfortable way. Also because the truck seats stick out on the sides, the cushion doesn't mold well into the back of the seat. So he uses the cushion at his computer desk, but not in the car where he really needs it.Before buying this product, you should think about the design of the seat where you'll use it. If the seat is molded with side wings, then I would find a cushion that is flat on the sides. If the seat has a flat back and sides, then this cushion would probably work pretty well. I gave it three stars, because there is nothing wrong with the product, but it's only suited to certain seat backs."

I may have not done it right. I found the book did not explain very well at all how much Iodine I should be using daily. Nor did the bottle..... so I was putting 1 or 2 drops in a glass of water every morning. After reading the book, I still had to go on the internet and try to calculate exactly what I should be using. Maybe I just did it wrong, but the book should have been more forthright about telling you how much to use."

1580,0,"I first must point out that this review does have the verified purchase label. I bought it, but I didn't use it. Since it was purchased through a third party, it took longer than the usual 2 days to arrive. Add to that, USPS lost the first one and they had to ship another. The vendor was great. During the time that I was waiting, I was thinking about some of the reviews I had read about it - about isolating where it went to keep it off the good skin, about how strong it was, etc. I remembered the go-to I usually use for any skin ailment:Bag Balm Ointment, 10 oz.. I knew I wouldn't have to worry about keeping it off the good skin. What did I have to lose but some time? I rubbed a small amount in and within a few days, noticed it wasn't as raised and was softer. It's now several weeks later and I think I'm the only one who could still tell where it was. I think it took longer to completely go away because I was pretty hit and miss about using it. It also might have worked faster if I had covered it with a band-aid. My skin hates the adhesive, so I just took my chances. I'm glad I tried something that I didn't have to worry about being harmful. You might want to give it a try. If it doesn't work, you can go back to the wart stick."
387293,0,"I bought these after trying (and really liking) Rainbow Light Prenatal One. I thought this was the same thing, just much cheaper. I got 180 tablets for $16.99 and was thinking, ""what a steal, and these will last almost through the end of the pregnancy.""That's when I noticed the label. Serving size: 6 tablets. I was nonplussed. You mean I've got to swallow six horse pills every day in order to get these nutrients?! That's no savings at all. That's your standard cost for a 30-day supply of prenatals.There's no question these are good vitamins, and the only ones I've found that contain iodine, something none of us get enough of. But at this price, I think I'll just go back to my Target generics, which have the same RDA for every nutrient and only lack iodine. I can eat more shellfish."

259262,0,"I really wanted to like this CD. The excellent reviews were encouraging. The CD arrived quickly and I was impressed with the professional packaging and booklet. I don't have time to listen to a CD like this during the day and thought it would be great to help me relax and sleep, while perhaps subconsciously absorbing some positive messages to help lose weight and exercise more. The CD starts out great, although I thought the audio could be a little better. I had to turn the volume up slightly higher than I prefer for bedtime listening in order to understand the speaker's words. I can live with that. The messages are quite good, calming, and I found myself really relaxing. I would start to drift off, and then..... the speaker becomes very excited, much louder, and she speaks quite rapidly. I think she's trying to be enthusiastic and encouraging, but for me it's the hypnotic equivalent of a cold shower. So, I'm disappointed for only that reason. The CD can't work for me because it doesn't fit my lifestyle which is to do my relaxation at bedtime, where I want to *stay* relaxed. And, there is a ""no return unless defective"" policy, which I guess I understand. Hopefully you will have better luck."
227366,0,"I purchased this item because I am seeking a method to soak my feet due to athletes foot and toenail fungus. So for that purpose, I'm satisfied.This product could be improved by the following recommendations:1. The vibrate mode is a little too noisy for my liking. And once the air(spa) mode is engaged, the noise volume is even higher. Definitely interferes with trying to soak and watch TV at the same time!2. I wish the manufacturer would have focused more on the heating aspect of the device. It claims to keep warm water warm for a longer period of time. I suppose this is true, but barely noticeable, if at all. I wish they would have installed a full fledged temperature controlled heating device. I could do without the vibrate and the bubbles :0).Given the relatively inexpensive price, I think it's still worth it, but you should know about the noise before you buy it."

I started having some problems with the razor about six months in but coaxed about six months more out before it went kaput.It is not the quickest and you may have to go over an area a couple times,, but it never hurt and I don't recall too much irritation, if you are looking for ultra smooth go with a razor,, but if really just doing normal grooming this is sufficient. While I was mad about it breaking down,,, 30 bucks for a year is pretty good... So i went with it again because anything cheaper seemed real cheap and I can't see myself going north of fifty for a groomer."

414732,0,"This item says one size fits most but should have a more accurate lable. I wear women's size 8 wide and these gel socks were uncomfortably tight. I made a cut directly in the middle straight up on top of the foot (from toe to knee). This made it much more comfortable. Don't make too large a cut because it must be slightly tight or it will turn/slide off of your heel. The heel seems impermeable which is an improvement on regular socks. Slather on creams and it won't leak through and stain your rug or grease your floor. I add a little tea tree oil into my creams to kill germs as I wouldn't want to wear a sock over and over without really washing well. It's not a sock you would throw into a washing machine but you can gently hand wash. After wearing a few days I have decided a gel sock that covers the toes is better, as the ball of my foot and toes need loving too."

114767,0,"Overall, this is a good razor- for the price.Couple of things to bear in mind. I am a light-bearded person who always follows an electric shave with a razor blade. While the quality of the cut is fine, it is hyberbole to suggest this 'cuts like a blade'.Another thing to bear in mind: when held level (much less upside down) the clippings slowly & steadily drip out. In practical terms, this means the product requires frequent washing. I would not recommend this for use in a car, for this reason.After several months, the product seems to retain a reasonable charge after several weeks of daily use."

What a mistake!I decided to clean one of my purses that was only lightly soiled. I sprayed a small area, waited, and it checked out OK. I began spraying other areas to clean them, carefully following directions and wiping with a wet rag. I did this clean and pat process 2 times over 2 days, allowing the purse to dry in-between. Although the purse looked a bit brighter, the soiled areas never really cleaned up. Unfortunately, this is where it starts to get bad.The third day I noticed a terrible smell from the bag, something that could only be called 'wet dog.' That smell began to increase over time to the point that the bag I had to put the bag in the basement. The smell is terrible, truly terrible. A month later the smell lessened but not to point that I would use the handbag & I donated it to G***will.As a result, I won't use this product again, and I don't recommend it."

Eventually it tore all of the stitches out leaving the unit unworkable. I have to sew it up.

70968,0,"I have tested many brands of electric shavers over the decades but I have stayed with Norelco because I prefer their design and performance. My present Norelco, about 5 years old, is still going strong but needs a new battery so I thought I'd try the Arcitec 1060. It looks very high-tech with its articulated heads, but the bottom line is it shaves no better than my old model. I actually shaved half my face with the Arcitec and the other half with my old one. There was not the slightest difference in the closeness and I had the same amount of stubble on both sides 24 hours later. What's more, my old Norelco still has its original blades! It's also more solid and I think it's nicer to use. Also, the Arcitec has very little space beneath the cutters to hold the beard clippings, so you have to wash the heads after every use. Not a big deal, but I wash my old heads maybe once a week. So the Arcitec is going back. My advice to those in need of a new shaver: Try one of Norelco's cheaper models first."

288243,0,"I searched and searched for anything that wasn't made in China but then again that information can be hard to verify with Amazon products. I finally settled on this item and having had it for a few weeks I would give it a tepid rating of mediocre at best. It works, but then again so would a small propane torch, that being said I would certainly prefer this over the torch. The blades spin very slow so there is an occasional &#34;snag&#34;, it doesn't completely stop but you can feel it when it isn't rotating fast enough to properly cut. It works intermittently, there have been a few occasions where I thought it was broken but after a few tries it started working again. I expect it to fail at any time and expected this right out of the package. The cheap plastic construction and &#34;just good enough&#34; construction are what you would expect out of a mass produced, non-designer produced happy meal toy. Even with a battery (which the included one was just about doa, I would have rather it not come with one at all rather than waste that shipping energy) it still felt flimsy and inconsequential.Yes, it works, but there have got to be many more solutions."

297402,0,"Better looking and can be washed with hot water and left to air dry. BUT, takes much longer to shave and doesn't seem as close. Also, as time has gone by since purchased, I seem to be getting less and less shaving time per re-charge. The old one also had an audible signal when to clean and re-charge--this one depends on you looking at the small ""signboard"" every time! Old model also seemed to be much more accurate in the amount of cut whiskers in the chamber when signaling to ""clean"". Perhaps the new Spectra is better, but don't trade in your old Norelco for this model!"
79632,0,"It has a cheap feel to it, and doesnt shave very well. When there's more than a day's growth, it pulls the hairs out instead of cuts them. Its like mini electric shocks that come at any time, not very fun to shave with. It gets the job done, but I'd go with a better model."
404286,0,"Perhaps my fault, but I searched 'rechargeable batteries' and these came up. The reviews were great so I bought them. I didn't read the description close enough because they actually are NOT rechargeable. They may still be great batteries, but wasn't what I was trying to buy so only giving it three stars as a result of the search problem."
17196,0,"I bought this as a replacement for another Remington shaver. Unfortunately, this shaver is simpler (and cheaper) as it doesn't have a short, second cutting blade, for trimming along the moustache and other close areas.The unit shaves very well. However, the one I bought malfunctioned - a piece of spring fell out of the head, misaligning the blade - and I cut myself.Overall, this shave is somewhat problematic and not as good a product as before."

I enjoyed the fact that each day's supplies of vitamins was packaged in a sealed packet. However, I didn't like the fact that there were six different pills to take. If you don't normally eat a well-balanced diet, then this product would make up the difference. I just didn't enjoy taking so many pills. I also didn't feel any difference, as the product claimed!"
310649,0,"I don't really notice the scented oil after the first few moments, so that sort of defeats the purpose, doesn't it? The citrus does smell like public bathroom deodorizer. I think the only reason I smell it at all is I get some of that oil on my hand when I open the bottle. It's not easy to squirt the stuff out without making a mess. And the water in mine is lasting too long, which makes me think it's not evaporating like it's supposed to. And my water has yet to get dirty. So how is this doing anything it's advertised to do?"
268816,0,"I bought this product because I read that it was a very effective sleep aid. While it does help me sleep better, I wasn't warned about the smell of it. This tea has a very strong earthy odor and everyone around me complains of the stink when I drink it. I personally have a very poor sense of smell so I can tolerate it. I think this should be part of the product description."

162846,0,"I purchased Cellfood a few nights ago at a local Whole Foods from a woman who claimed that it would assist with high energy levels. I can definitely use that energy boost, so I gave it a try. I do feel a bit ripped off though since I paid $34.99 with what I was told was a coupon. Sadly that ""coupon"" is actually a rebate so I didn't get to pay the $29.99 I was hoping to pay. Oh well.Anyway, the following morning I put 4 drops into a large glass of water at work. I definitely did feel more focused and energetic, which is good since my work is terribly mind-numbing. I don't believe that this is a placebo effect since I constantly feel energized when taking only a few drops.However, this afternoon I woke up feeling extremely dehydrated. I woke up feeling symptoms from a massive hangover even though I didn't drink last night - extreme dry mouth, dry throat, headache, weakness. I noticed also that since I started taking Cellfood, my urine has been bright yellow and my stool is hard. For reference, I'm 28 years old, vegetarian who doesn't consume dairy, and I exercise a few days a week. I tend to be a little dehydrated at times, but not to the point where I have to make a 1 a.m. trip to Walgreens to buy Pedilite and Smart Water.I'm definitely willing to give this product another chance but I'm a little more cautious now. Consider this review ""to be continued."""
20676,2,"I had the same experience as the fellow who wrote the July '06 review. I ordered the part in the first week of May '06 to only have it delayed 3 times for shipment. I just got another delay notice from Amazon today, July 10. At this rate they'll never ship the item.If they can't ship, why in the world do they list this item???UPDATE: Amazon finally shipped the product after the 3rd delay. Replacing the screen/cutter restores the shaver to like-new performance. Overall I find the Activator to give a decent shave with minor irritation. Using a William's Lectric Shave helps even more by reducing irritation to nearly zero, lightly lubes the screen/cutter and keeps the screen reasonably cool to the touch. My previous screen did last about 19 months so the longevity (in my case) is excellent."

242578,0,"I have been a huge fan of the entire Met-Rx Big 100 line, and this was the only variety I had yet to try since I'm scared of sugar alcohols (!!). Nevertheless, being a connoisseur of apples, I had extremely high hopes for this flavor and decided to see if it'd go down all right. The bar was fairly sweet, crunchy, cinnamon-y, and pretty appetizing with the exception of one incongruent factor I felt made the bar unpalatable--those rubbery, gummy apple chunks. Each bite one squirmed its way into was ruined. Sure, I could have picked them out (probably will on the second half of the bar sitting in my desk drawer), but I paid good money for the thing! I'm glad I only bought one of this flavor, and likely won't buy it again. Go for the Super Cookie Crunch if you want a treat. Oh and on the plus side the gram and a half of sugar alcohols in half the bar didn't bug me if you're sensitive, too."

403099,0,"We bought these as a recommendation from my dad and stepmom who are very involved with homeopathic medicines. We were trying to slow the growth of an inoperable facial tumor in our beloved dog, but we don't know if it was too late or if the product didn't work. The tumor grew exceptionally fast and we had to put her down this week. We had been using the product for about 2 mos. but it was difficult to get an exact dosage for her."
52045,0,"I have been using this epilator for years now, mainly because its the only thing that really works, other than tweezing, which just takes too long. It usually takes me about 10 mins, and I use it about every 4-6 weeks.However, the downside is that it's extremely painful! I cringe every time I have to use it, because i know how much it's going to hurt. Then after using it, I get red bumps on the sensitive skin of my neck/ jaw line, which lasts about a week! It sucks breaking out in a rash, but it's better than having facial hair!Overall, I would recommend it just because it works so good, but beware of the pain, and don't buy if you have very sensitive skin."
77328,0,"This item is not as loud as I expected it to be. My Air Purifier is even louder. Marpac should make three levels to the sound volume on any future machines. It needs to be a bit louder. Other than that, it's good and can still be used along with my other white noise makers."
226845,0,Received a case. One bottle leaked on the rest. Took some time to clean up. Price was a little higher than I could of paid at a local store. Product works well.
111161,0,"Overall, it's a decent product. It seems to run small, as I used the measurement chart and got the correct size but it didn't fit. Also, if you have larger breast, this is going to be very uncomfortable. So, if you are shaped like the mannequin in the picture, then this is the product for you. If you are a bigger gal, like myself, then maybe not so much."
198890,0,"This walker is very good for getting around in tight places since you can close it while walking. However, I do not feel as steady with it as I do with the four-wheel walker. Also it does not roll over bumps and uneven ground as well as the four-wheel. And it is heavy. On the plus side it is small enough to fit in the trunk of most cars."
290907,0,This stuff smells awful... I'm still taking it. I'm not taking it as often as suggested though so I'm not getting the full benefits of the Spirulina.I have to hold my breathe when I take these though... it's an awful fishy/fish food smell... there is no taste going down though.

The quality of the stocking is good though, so , I will keep them and hope they do not stretch out."
375841,0,"The product does exactly as its suppose to do. Sticks to the wall. The bunny part has no controls so its a one setting fits all. On top of that, its a turn on by closing , no button start.

158923,0,This is my 2nd Beard trimmer. (I had purchased my other one nearly 5 years ago and this spring it just died.) The new on does the same thing as the old one and so far it is operating fine. It is the only one that cleans up after you and that is why I got it. I just hope that the new one lasts more than 5 years given that I use is only about 60 times per year.
310902,2,"I purchased these pregnancy tests because I use birth control to skip my periods. Having had issues in the past with birth control, my doctor recommended that I test for pregnancy the week my period was suppose to be do and a week after. For 6 months, I have been taking the pill without a break (skipping my period due to endometriosis). I've been testing correctly. FMU and using a cup. It's not difficult so I know I was testing correctly. Well come to find out, I am 3 months pregnant. I had a feeling I was. Bought an EPT and it popped positive right away. I am not sure WHY these tests didn't work... But I am not very pleased."
282126,2,"I bought a box of these because they combine Jet-Dry (which, I'm sorry, does not work) with a pre measured tablet of detergent. The results are horrible. Dishes are barely clean and covered in spots. Do not waste your money, go with Cascade 2-In-1 Action Pacs instead."
231417,2,"I bought this product after 12 months of trying to get pregnant. I have very regular cycles and had been using the online ovulation calendar programs to predict ovulation. As far as I can tell, the OV Watch is an extremely expensive ovulation calendar. I used it for three months and each month it was off by 5-7 days. I double checked it with ovulation test strips and by taking my BBT--and each month the watch was wrong! I'm not convinced that it is actually reading any hormone levels, I think it's just calculating when you should ovulate based on the day of your last period and your cycle length. I can get that information online for free.In addition to the fact that the watch doesn't work at all, it is very tempermental and just a pain to deal with. I was constantly having to clean the sensor, readjust it, test it. And one time, halfway through my cycle, the watch just stopped reading completely and I had to wait til the next month and try a new sensor.This item is way overpriced for what it does. Some people have gotten good results, but again I think that's because the watch just predicts when you should ovulate based on basic math. Do a google search for ovulation calendars and you will find tons of websites that will do the same thing this watch does. Just like the watch, you input the day of your last cycle, your cycle length and the calendar will generate a window of time that you will be fertile. Save your money and don't get this watch!"

60270,0,When I received the batteries I charged them in my MAHA powerx charger. I ran it on the break in cycle which charges and discharges a number of times to charge the battery to the optimun voltage. One battery charged to 900mah. The other only charged to 750 mah. Did the break in charge 2 more times. still the same. Guess I got a bum battery. They work ok but when used as a pair I will only get 750 mah out of the set. The weakest battery determines the output of the pair.

My 7 month old son loves it, the colors are nice and bright and the non slip bottom and inflated sides makes it great. I don't think it will last him till he is 2 though, as already it seems a bit small. I still love it though, it is high enough that i don't have to bend over too much like with some of the plastic tubs. The suction cup doesn't work well for me but that's okay as i leave it inflated and just turn it over to drip dry in the bath when i am done with it. The HOT indicator seems to say hot all the time, but again, no problem since i test the water temp myself anyway. All in all, for the price, it can't be beat!!!"
243408,0,"I did a personal comparison of meters including Nova Max, Trueresult, Freestyle lite, Contour, One Touch ultra mini, Accu-chek, Embrace talking meter, Relion Prime, and Prodigy talking. My test was for 10 days and I took blood once a day for each meter (all tests were in the morning - fasting). I saw a lot of difference in the readings and judged my results from ease of use, price, result continuality, Of these meters the Accu-chek was just an average meter. The numbers seamed to fluctuate less that the other meters. The cost of the test strips are on the higher end. This test was done on my own so it was not done in a laboratory so my results are not scientific just my honest opinion."
51243,0,"First off, some parts (the cooling glove and the smart start head) are missing, as other previous customers have complained. How is it that they can advertise a product as coming with certain parts, and then you get a box which doesn't contain all the parts advertised?Secondly, the product does work, but it's rather painful, and you have to keep going over the same spots repeatedly until the hairs are finally all plucked out. Maybe I will like it better as time goes on. I am using it regularly. I am somewhat more used to this kind of discomfort because I have used leg wax often. However, my 2 daughters, who usually shave, say the epilator is too painful for them to use."

354512,0,"I recently took the plunge and made the switch to reusable pads. These Glad Rags work well and are very well made. I specifically like the way the wings wrap around your undies and snap in place. I also like the multiple inserts provided because they allow you to choose how thick the pad needs to be. I've been sincerely satisfied with the product itself, but even at the price they are here on Amazon, I still believe they are more expensive than they should be (hence, three stars instead of five).When I looked at the pads I recieved, even as well made as they are, I quickly realized it wouldn't be hard to make them and felt a little ripped off at the price I'd paid. I later found several websites that offer patterns and ideas for sewing your own at a fraction of the cost. So if you are looking to purchase these and you have even the most beginner's skill in sewing, do a little online research and ask yourself if it might be better to make them yourself. You could spend $100 or more to purchase enough of these pads to last a single period versus $10-$25 in materials to make them."

420153,0,"I have dry eyes that require me to put drops in several times a day. At its worse my eyes were so dry that I had trouble opening my eyelids in the morning, they were stuck to my eyes. I have tried a large number of eye drops, which helped me with various degrees.Refresh Liquigel blurs my vision, and when I wake up my eyes a covered with crusty residue of the gell. I don't like how the eyes feel in the morning. The packaging of Liquigel looks very similar to Lubricant drops, and at least on one occasion I bought the Liquigel by mistake after I already knew it did not work well for me. I hope this warning helps someone to avoid the same mistake. (Note that the image in this stock photo does not look like the Refresh Liquigels I bought, so maybe they changed the packaging to address this issue).My favorite eye drop is Refresh Tears Lubricant Eye drops, 1.08oz bottle. It does not irritate my eyes, it provides a long lasting effect, it does not blur my vision when it is applied. It works equally well during the day and night.Refresh Tears Drops for Sensitive eyes single use vials work very well. They have no preservatives and are better for sensitive eyes, however they are more expensive the Refresh Tears in a bottle. Each vial has 4 drops. So I feel I am wasting the money if I use it just once. It is possible to re-close the vial for a second use the same day, but only if you can place the container somewhere it will not be disturbed, since the closure is pretty loose. I use these when my eyes are particular sensitive.Systane lubricant drops irritate my eyes, they become hot and itchy and the eyes need almost constant lubrication. I don't understand why this happens, I don't have any allergies. I have tried this lubricant several times, because my doctor likes it and offers me samples at every visit.GenTeal Librican Oitment blurs my vision after application, so I can only use it at night. When I wake up my eyes are crusty with the residue of the lubrication.Genteal Lubricant Gen Aqua does not irritate my eyes, but the effect of the drop seem not to last. I need to reapply these drops much more frequently than Refresh Tears.Murine Lubricant Drops do not irritate my eyes, but the effect of the drop seem not to last. I need to reapply these drops much more frequently than Refresh Tears.Visine drops are very inexpensive and work well in my eyes, but my eye doctor told me not to use any lubricant that has `get the red out' in the name. He said it has extra medication to constrict blood vessels in the eye, and he said such drops should not be used for every day use.On my last visit, my doctor suggested that I try taking 2 triple omega oil pills a day, as he found it really helps eye dryness. I was skeptical, but figured I would give it a try since fish oil has other positive effects. 2 weeks later I really began feeling a difference, my eyelids are no longer stuck to my eyes in the morning. I still use eye drops, it just does not feel as urgent when I wake up."

Why WaterPik doesn't make a kit to replace the part that you can unscrew underneath the unit that has the hose connection and the assembly then connects directly to the pump...but I quess we all know THAT answer; they want you to have to purchase an entire new unit!

Attaching the cord wil not run this trimmer/clipper, battery has to be charged before doing anything (in 20xl in situation when battery is gone I could always attach the power cord and continue).

13048,0,"If this just stayed warm longer, it would be perfect.On the plus side: Perfect fit. The Velcro works perfectly and keeps it as tight or as loose as I want it. It has a nice heavy feel. Heavy enough to stay close to the skin for good therapy, but not too heavy to be uncomfortable. The neck is a difficult place to treat/fit. This does it very well. It's great to be free of electrical cords. I can move about freely. It fits snugly against the neck so I can wear a sweater over it without a problem. Being able to do hot and cold is a plus, although I have not used the cold yet.The only negative is the temperature control. It takes a bit of experimenting to find the right time, since each microwave is different. Then it cools off very quickly. Even if I heat to the point where I can barely stand the heat, it is almost cold in 15 minutes. This means I need to keep running back to the microwave.The TheraTherm shoulder pad is a better option for me. It is electric and has excellent temperature control. The cord is long enough to make it usable. I just wish its strap was as good as this one."

416573,2,"Forty years ago, when I helped my client brands at Procter & Gamble write their annual business plans, we used to chuckle when we prepared the section on our competitors. This was especially so when we were up against ""Big Stupids,"" as we referred to the marketing monkeys at Colgate-Palmolive.It seems some things never change. Case in point:For many years, my wife has consistently swooned at the scent of my preferred deodorant, Mennen Speed Stick (made by Colgate - hey, their product formulation folks weren't all that bad!). So I hunted all over for a Mennen After Shave or Cologne, in hopes that it might carry the same kind of appeal. I was finally able to find only this one last bottle of Mennen Skin Bracer online at amazon, and jumped to order it.Severe disappointment ensued as soon as the product arrived. The scent was not even close to Speed Stick. Rather bland and innocuous, in fact. No wonder the product can no longer be found.So I sent Colgate's ""customer service"" folks an e-mail and suggested that they might still find a market for an after shave that carried the same scent as Speed Stick. In due time I got back a ""kiss off"" note saying they can't talk about their new product plans. I think they were also mistakenly worried about intellectual property issues, where none exist in fact since the Speed Stick formula is their own trade secret.As it happens, market research has repeatedly shown that the best ideas for new products come from customers who express their wishes or the problems that they would like to see solved. But apparently the brand management or new product execs at C-P think they know better than the folks who still consume their wares.Too bad for them. Guess I'll have to start rubbing Speed Stick on my cheeks as well as my armpits. Maybe that will make my wife happy. But not me."

Again, a week or two later, I'm adjusting again. The next time I go to do it, I've run out of velcro and the elastic has pretty much lost it's elasticity.

Short of nasal surgery or one of those forced air machines, I don't believe there is a better solution.Yes, they look stupid, and I've used them so long I have sometimes been seen in public with one still on my nose. Not intentionally, since they are certainly not a fashion statement.You do need to make sure your nose is clean and oil free before applying.

90900,0,"After reading the reviews for the over bed table (Invacare model #6417) I was concerned about the overall quality and whether the assembly would be a problem. After shopping for other models on different websites the Invacare table seemed to be as good as others in the price range. I ordered the table on a Monday and received it 8 days later. It was well packaged, all the parts were in the box, and the manufacturer label indicated Invacare rather than Drive Medical. The assembly was surprisingly easy. There were 6 screws and 2 bolts that had to be attached and the table was ready to use. All the holes lined up and I used a cordless screw driver to attach the screws. No problems! As an ""older"" female (mechanically challenged) customer I was concerned after reading the reviews but the assembly was completed in less than 10 minutes! Just be sure and replace the ""transport"" screw on the adjustable column with the included screw and also remember to unlock the 2 wheels to roll it across the floor. For the price it is not a bad table. I am using it for a laptop table next to my bed and it is sturdy enough that I don't fear leaving my 17"" laptop on it. One thing I appreciate is that the base slides under my bed which is low to the floor. There is just a tiny bit of wobble if I place my elbows on the table but no problems with a cup of coffee or a glass of water. I probably would not roll it across carpet with an open drink though. The adjustment lever is slightly stiff but is not a problem even with arthritic hands. All in all, this is a good table for the money. Quality materials, easy to assemble, and fits my needs.I recently purchased another table (November, 2012) for my den by looking in my Amazon Past Orders list and placing my order from there. Unfortumately, although the item numbers and price are the same, the new table is a different color and has a plastic lever instead of metal. In addition the new table is raised by pushing upward from the underneath side rather than making upward adjustments by the lever. Even though they should be the same, they are not, and the plastic lever may or may not hold up with repetitive use."

The shave itself does seem a little closer than when I used my Gillette Fusion, but it also takes a whole lot longer to do the shave. I think my face may be a bit worse than others because I have hair grain that goes in many directions, and also because I have a bit of fat face (double chin). The neck definitely seems a whole lot harder to shave than my face. I found that using Lectric Shave helps a lot, more than the oil recommended in another post, and more than not doing anything.My biggest problem is that I keep cutting myself, especially my ears when shaving my sideburns area. I never cut myself with the Fusion, and definitely never my ears! I have no idea why that happens, I'm very careful, but it still happens and HURTS!"
376690,0,Our current housing is small so we purchased this instead of a infant tub. I like it because it dries quickly and thoroughly unlike the big sponge ones. We also like it because instead of the infant laying flat he is in a reclined position that allows him to see more and he loves being able to kick his feet in the water you can't do that with the sponges. This one also folds for storage making it even smaller. The only thing I would change would be making the mesh with a little more give to cradle the infant a little more and help with the sliding issue (when your baby kicks and moves around they slide down a little) my boy is over 10lbs now and the mesh still doesn't give much and stays straight instead of cradling him.

41285,0,"I recently took the plunge and made the switch to reusable pads. These Glad Rags work well and are very well made. I specifically like the way the wings wrap around your undies and snap in place. I also like the multiple inserts provided because they allow you to choose how thick the pad needs to be. I've been sincerely satisfied with the product itself, but even at the price they are here on Amazon, I still believe they are more expensive than they should be (hence, three stars instead of five).When I looked at the pads I recieved, even as well made as they are, I quickly realized it wouldn't be hard to make them and felt a little ripped off at the price I'd paid. I later found several websites that offer patterns and ideas for sewing your own at a fraction of the cost. So if you are looking to purchase these and you have even the most beginner's skill in sewing, do a little online research and ask yourself if it might be better to make them yourself. You could spend $100 or more to purchase enough of these pads to last a single period versus $10-$25 in materials to make them."

I did feel a little extra energy, cutting my sleep from 11-8 hours & dropping a afternoon nap. My depression subsided as well & I had enough energy to start walking. But after 2 weeks I had zero weight loss & I don't overeat. Being discouraged I started South Beach Diet, dropped diet supplements & added vitamin supplements, & I lost 8 lbs in one week & have incredible energy & feel great overall! I gave it a 3 because I won't be buying it again & threw the remaining pills away. Also, it is important to not take it with another metabolism enhancer - even though info states it is safe to take with other diet pills. I coupled it with Zantex-3 one day (1/2 serving even) & had heart attack symptoms constantly for 24 hours. Neither one seperately had given me any strange symptoms, but together they caused constant heartburn, tightness, fullness, indigestion, tingling tongue, tingling left side of face, pain/numbness/tingling down neck, shoulder, back & left arm to fingers, aching arm, cold/sweaty hands, shivers & pretty much an inability to function for 24 hours (0-sleep). Now in themselves & with the Aquadrene & Lipovarin, I'm sure they are fine, but be wary of mixing with diet pills."

Everything on this mop is sturdy, the handle is great, and the sponge portion itself works good. But if you do any kind of real scrubbing by pushing down, after a while the plastic quarter-turn nuts that affix the sponge to the mop break. Thankfully replacement sponges come with new nuts."

There is a dual pack available that contains an Omega 3 supplement with additional folic acid, so taken together, you get 1000mg of folic acid a day which is perfect for prenatal development. This was the only supplement I found that contained 1000mg of folic acid. The multi is vegan, the supplement is not.

It's uncomfortable at the start, and still has been for a month now. It's better now than before, but it's not like I lay down on it and think, ""wow I'm comfortable"".Also, it's starting to get flat already, sigh, but all pillows do that.I won't be replacing it, but I still give it a lukewarm recommendation. I believe it helped me heal my neck sprain faster than usual, and I believe it is helping fix my too straight neck."

292943,0,"I used these to quit smoking successfully for a while, but then couldn't get off of the lozenges. I ended up starting smoking again because I was throwing more money at lozenges than cigarettes, with no end in sight. I constantly craved them and kept popping more and more.I've done patches previously and they worked pretty well (I started about a year later out of my own stupidity). The thing I like about them is that it is totally controlled. Cravings might be a little tougher during stressful moments, but you don't have the temptation of taking more or having to regulate it yourself. Stick one on in the morning and that's it. No grabbing for more or looking at the clock in anticipation of the next fix.Normally I would say pick the product that YOU control (rather than it being controlled for you), but I don't think anyone buying nicotine cessation products has the control they need anyway. Otherwise you could just quit smoking without the help.Trust me, you probably want the ease of sticking it on in the morning and forgetting about it."

89959,0,"I ordered this for my spouse who was looking for a 'better' wrinkle cream as she is spending an arm and a leg on brand cremes that do nothing but make her face glisten.So we read up on the reviews and found this brand to be generally well received. 5 stars for a cream? Youse gots to be kidding. This stuff will remove dents from my car! Anyways, all kidding aside: having used for 2 months her comments are that it is a great moisturizer and feels great on the skin but it has not visibly improved the semi-deep wrinkles between her eyebrows and besides her eyes. We want it to work but alas, with steady use as prescribed, we have seen nothing visible. She will keep on using it because it is a good creme at a very reasonable price but perhaps we expected too much result? Or her wrinkles are unlike any kind this company has dealt with? (Just kidding, sweetheart).Hope that this blance towards the lower rating does not upset the believers but we cannot see the results we expected. 5 stars for a great cream moisturizer, and -2 stars for leaving the crows feet and wrinkles untouched. Since no other cream has ever helped with wrinkles we still consider this a better deal.If you disagree, please blame it on our high expectations!"

However for some reason, they're smaller than Lansinoh's disposable nursing pads, so they tend to shift around in my bra and fall out fairly easily when I open my bra to breastfeed. There are two darts that are supposed to form a pocket to hold the pad in place, but again the pad's too small so the pocket's too small to work.I've thrown them in the washer and dryer several times and so far no shrinking or pilling or anything.

I do have to say that the company sent me an e-mail stating that they have a money back guarantee and that I could send it back, but I'm opting to keep it, thinking that if any of us ever injure our ankles, it could serve as a somewhat suitable brace."

197305,0,"This did not magically solve all of my sinus problems. But I did find it to be a decent weapon in my arsenal during a recent sinus infection. I found a few sprays in each nostril was enough to get things flowing, at least a little bit during times when my 12 hr decongestant seemed to be waning. But the effect is short lived and not nearly as dramatic for me as others have reported. I'm not sure I would buy it again, unless it was on sale for half price.As for the burning, 1 spray stings a bit - not unlike eating too much wasabi or spicy mustard at a japanese or chinese restaurant. 2-3 sprays is borderline excruciating, but the pain only lasts about 30-40 seconds. It was bearable. I'd say this is worth a shot if you're desperate for relief. It wasn't a miracle cure for me, but I don't disbelieve those who say it worked for them. There are lots of causes of sinus congestion. Maybe this only works for certain kinds."
186433,1,"I was looking for a tasty protein shake made with natural ingredients and made with stevia. I love stevia and believe it is the only safe low calorie sweetener out there. I came across Metabolic Reset and decided to give it a try. It tastes so good! I've tried the chocolate and vanilla and love both flavors. It's so good, I feel like it's a treat I get every morning! I actually look forward to it. I mix it with 1 cup unsweetened almond milk and add 14 ice cubes. Then blend it all together for a yummy milkshake. It really does taste like a milkshake too. Sometimes I add coffee to make a protein frappuccino. The best part, it's low calorie. Even with adding my unsweetened almond milk, it's only 170 calories. That's a low calorie breakfast. It fills me up for about 2 hours. After 2 hours I start feeling a little hungry and by 3 hours later I need to eat."

150672,0,"So, in the spirit of full disclosure: I have no idea if these work, so my rating is based entirely on the taste. I know this isn't quite fair, but the flavor is all I have to go on.We bought these for our 2 year old daughter who was born with a bladder defect that puts her at VERY high risk for (i.e. guaranteed to get a) kidney infection if she gets a UTI. She has never had a UTI, though, so we don't know if taking these have helped her avoid them. I don't know if our hypervigilance about cleaning her after soiled diapers or some anatomical advantage has kept her from getting UTIs, but we're grateful she's avoided them so far.Anyway, that said, our daughter doesn't really like to take these (I've tried them and don't prefer them, either). They have a tartness to them that is just a tad too strong. I don't tend to like tartness (I don't like rhubarb pie, for example), so I'm sure this flavor might be nice for some folks. Anyway, the brand that works well for my daughter is: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028N1Z6/ref=wms_ohs_product"
400675,1,"These heel cups basically support the back 2/3's of your foot (which takes all the pressure) in a wide V-shape. This means the pressure of your weight avoids the center line where your ""heel bone"" is.I have flat feet, and the padding over my heel is very thin. When I stand without shoes, my ankles bend inward, and on a hard floor my heel is uncomfortable. I've tried lots of different shoe inserts, but I don't notice much difference except in this one.When I spent most of my time walking and sitting, these inserts worked great in my sneakers. Now, I stand all day for work and I wear the inserts with boots. If I wear shoes without the inserts for a couple days my feet quickly develop a ""my feet hurt"" and a ""I'm tired of standing"" feeling. My legs also get sore more easily.Be forewarned, the first couple days I wore these, my ankles felt a little funny, almost sore (very minimal discomfort). After a week, my ankles had adjusted and were perfectly happy. After a couple weeks, I could switch between inserts or no-inserts without my ankles noticing. Keep in mind, this was very small discomfort, I only just noticed it because I was paying attention.***NOTE***: You will need to use these in decent shoes, not girly-pathetic shoes. These supports flex to fit in your shoe, so they need your shoe to have sides that press back against them. For example, you can place them in boots, sneakers, and men's dress shoes. When placed in a low ""flat,"" like a Mary Jane, they will not work. (When you apply your weight, the support will flatten and press outwards. This widens your shoe instead of supporting your foot.) You probably shouldn't be wearing that kind of shoe if you want happy feet anyway!Also, I've worn the same pair for 3 yrs. Recently, the fabric has started to wear away."

116874,1,"I invested in some serious shaving equipment after reading an article about it. It specifically recommended Geo F. Trumper's products. It eliminated the razor burn on my face, which is awesome. I also bought a decent razor (old-school, non-disposable, non-cartridge--an actual safety razor, a giant step up) and a shaving brush, which helps a lot. And some stuff to put on afterward that also helps prevent razor burn. This brand's line is called ""skin food"". Aside from the razor burn thing, which was annoying, girls really seem to respond to this and I don't pretend to understand why. I assume it's the smell, etc, or maybe it does more than I realize. In any case, this stuff is pretty good and my girlfriend/s have more than made up for the somewhat higher price it sells for. It does last for a long time."

410335,0,"BUT--and my review is based on all diffusers and a different fragrance than this one---be careful where you place your diffusers, as these oils often (always?) permanently stain lighter-tinted carpets. If you place them on the floor, keep them out of the way of vacuum cleaner cords, which will knock them right over even if they are in a box-like container, which I learned the hard way, w/ a greenish-tinted, deliciously-fragranced Pier One Apple Oak reed diffuser. Also, I still have that 1/2-filled diffuser (purch. at Xmas), and although I frequently reverse the reeds, I now barely smell it, even close up. Am wondering if the reeds ""wear out,"" or if I am just too used to that wonderful fragrance. Somewhat disappointing."

You can add unsweetened egg protein powder to mashed potatoes or soup, but with the stevia this stuff tastes disgusting added to anything but dairy or fruit.

It makes your glass of whole milk as sweet as a McDonald's milkshake, which isn't horrible, but is not my preference.Other than being over-sweetened, it's cheap and effective."
122971,0,"But I've experienced every breastfeeding problem you can have but one so perhaps I'm not the right one to judge this product. The thing I really did like about the Motherlove nipple cream was the consistency compared to the Lanolin nipple cream - much easier to apply and wash off your hand afterwards. But really, there wasn't a noticeable improvement in discomfort after using either one.(To be fair, my first lactation consultant somehow didn't catch that my baby was latching on incorrectly so I've had constant blisters, as well as other painful breastfeeding problems, and no cream can work miracles)."
78277,1,"This white noise machine is great. I've had it for about 6 weeks and it creates a nice soft sea of fuzzy sound. It's not as loud as I had anticipated, but to my surprise it completely drowns out the household sounds that keep a toddler from falling asleep in our small apartment. The only thing I don't like about it is that recently I have begun to hear voices coming out of it, and sometimes music too. I am not sure what this is about, but now that I have heard them, they won't stop. But overall I recommend this better than any looped, digital, or recorded noise."
49947,2,"This heating pad will not last. Do yourself a favor and buy any other brand. This heating pad stopped working and I contacted the company because it offers a ""lifetime warranty"". They asked me a bunch of questions on how I used the heating pad. Do you lay on it or did you lean against it? Of course I did. If you do either of these two things with their heating pad, it will eliminate the warranty. This is a copy of their response: Heating pads are not designed to be laid on or leaned against. Nor are they designed to be used under covers or blankets. The pad needs to have one side exposed to the open air at all times so that it can breathe. If the pad cannot breathe it could over heat, bunch up, melt, crumble, kink, or simply fail to work. Using your heating pad in that way voids the limited warranty because it not a recommended use for the pad, and it will almost definitely fail if used in that way. The pad should only be placed over the area that needs treatment.So if you are planning on leaning against the pad (such as back pain) or laying on the pad, forget this product. I guess you could use this product for back pain by standing up and laying it against your back so it could still breathe. Try the Sunbeam or any other choice."
381736,2,"This worked fine in the little apartment I used to be in with linoleum flooring in the kitchen--not that I cared much what my floors looked like then anyway with two roommates.But now I'm in my own house with a husband. We've got some sort of fake wood flooring and the wet jet leaves streaks like crazy on it and it looks filmy after use. Since the swiffer sweeper doesn't pick up crap as far as dirt or hair goes, the wet jet just gums up all the dirt and hair and leaves it stuck to the floor. Lovely.I strongly regret buying a wet jet and a swiffer sweeper for this house. I should've thought more about a nicer house vs. low level apartment. With all the replacement pads, etc... we've gotten it's probably been a nice hundred bucks wasted on swiffer. I'm searching for a better alternative."

Then a couple of month ago I purchased another tube and discovered like most other reviewers that you can't massage or shake the tube enough to keep it from dispensing a watery oily mess before the cream comes out. I thought maybe I had purchased an old tube or something. So sad because the separated product is not easy to apply at all.

Because my poor little girl's room smelled like pee so bad the next morning, I started pulling the draw string and stuffing the bag in the pail to try and keep the smell in, but that is not working either. It has felt a bit damp to me as well. I have a small wet happened bag I travel with that does a great job, so I think that I will look for something larger like that.

388580,0,"I am a first time user and it was TOUGH! I was just too hungry. I think that a week or so before you start you should start cutting down on calories because it is such a shock on you body. I drank organic juices along with all the water that is required and it will fill your stomach but not satisfy the hunger. By day 3 I had a cup of steamed veggies for dinner. The fiber is not too bad if you take it with juice. The pills can be an overload after a while, but all that is nothing compared to the starvation feeling I had during the week.Overall the product works because I noticed a big difference in my bowel movements even though I cheated by eating veggies and fruits. I would do it again but I would have to be more disciplined in my diet before starting it."
259180,0,"I understand the debate around steam vs. UV - i.e., UV only kills bacteria/viruses that live on the exposed surfaces of the toothbrush, whereas steam kills even the deepest recesses. My issue is balancing sterilization with convenience. It's a pain to clean this unit of accumulated gunk (which settles at the bottom...yuck), the cleaning cycle takes a long time, and it's too large to travel with. I think I'm okay with the trade-off of 99.995 UV kill rate vs. 99.999 steam kill rate, in exchange for not having to deal with water drips, discolored bristles, shorter life of my expensive Sonicare brush heads, etc. In addition to my big UV unit at home, I have a portable UV sterilizer that doubles as a toothbrush case for use when I travel."

378837,2,"I got this bathtub because I read good reviews about it; however, since using it, I haven't been all that enthusiastic. I do like the fact that you can use it several different ways, but my biggest complaint about it is that the underside of the support ring has sharp edges. When I first started using the ring, I didn't realize it was so sharp, and my daughter kept getting tiny scrapes on her legs. I figured out that it was the bath ring, and now I'm more careful, but I think the manufacturer should have made the tub with delicate baby skin in mind. Also, who wants to collapse the tub after every bath, which the directions suggest that you do? If you don't collapse it, even if you turn it upside to dry, the edges that slide together can begin to mildew. In hindsight, I would buy a tub that's all one-piece."

The area where I used ""Goof Off"" is restored to new clean whiteness. The area where I used ""Goo Gone"" still has the latex paint, not degraded a bit.So, these types of products are not the same at all. Of course, the description of this product does not say it removes paint. Best just to stick with removing ""goo"" with this product."

Ordinarily, you get all the nutrition you need from eating a normal diet. I am reducing my calories, and thought this might be helpful with vitamin C each day per the tv show. I am not sure what the Royal Jelly is doing, but I do have improved kidney function which is always good. I am of the feeling that these suppliments have a high placebo effect, so a jelly bean taken once a day might have a similar effect. The product seems to be of the highest quality. It has no taste or oder, and is a coarse gray powder in a clear gelatin capsule. Amazon had the best price, compared to local vitamin shops."

While the product didn't live up to my high expectations, I am sure it will work for many of you. This was my first time trying to polish metal, and I believe I expected too much from a simple cost effective cleaning cloth."

Also, it didn't keep my armpits smelling great all day, I smelled like B.O. by the end of the day and the next morning, it was completely gone. So, it is all natural, which is nice, but I don't think it works all that better than regular deoderant. Sorry Howard Stern."

281661,0,"It does the job but not very elegantly. The Velcro is old school Velcro instead of the more modern micro Velcro you can find on other braces. Its probably one of the better braces on Amazon, but not better than the Futuro brand at my local CVS. And for less money. The heat activation thing really just makes me sweat and thus makes the brace smell pretty fast. Instead of one or two well placed bits of Velcro, it has four. Three to close the part closest to your elbow and one to wrap around as shown in the photo. The placement of these pieces of Velcro not only gets in the way of the other pieces of Velcro but the wrap around one is right at the wrist joint and if you put it too tight, it ends up pinching that nerve.All in all...it keeps you from having carpel tunnel problems, but in a pretty awkward way. I wish I'd just gone to my local CVS and got the Futuro to begin with because thats what I use now. I can't for the life of me find it online, but this blog has a photo of it. [...]"

It just seemed so obvious. We have a dog and it was sitting beside the shovel. I was definitely wrong though. This thing can pick up several things such as socks, shoes and other kinds of clothing that I'm simply too lazy to toss in the dirty hamper, but it can't pick up round stuff such as playful toys, balls and other objects. I also get the feeling this thing could easily break and wouldn't be very squeezable if that were to happen. Buy this product for the clothes your family carelessly (of which I'm included as I reluctantly mention above) leaves on the floor but for no other reason since you'd only end up disappointed."
269220,0,"Let me start off by saying I am a shift worker. I've been one for almost 14 yrs. In that time I have used sleep masks on and off throughout those years in all different sizes and shapes. This one is no different. It does the job very well. I am a heavy sleeper but I like total darkness to fall asleep and stay asleep. That is exactly what this mask does. The problem I have in particular with this mask is that I don't like to feel that I have one on. With this mask I definitly feel it. It is very nice to the touch, silky even, but a little too bulky for my taste. I have woken up with my nose and ears a little sore. It might have something to do with my features. I have a small head, big nose, and ears. So it didn't work out too well for me, but it is still a nice mask. Just make sure it works for your particular features."

It sits a good 5"" or so off of the bed, which is fine for most back sleepers, but side sleepers probably won't like it. Also, by the time you put the recommended starting amount of water in the pillow it weighs a TON. You'll probably re-injure your back just lifting this puppy!!Overall, I was disappointed and my search for the perfect pillow must continue."

I really didn't want one that flips up on it's own, like the restaurant ones, I want one that will stay flush with the floor. So, I bought this to try, and it is so flimsy and cheap that I've given up on it. My husband hands down refuses to use it. The design is that you can snap the dustpan up, or snap it down. But when it's snapped down, it fits so loosely with the pole, that it sloshes around and is difficult to use. I wrapped the base in a paper towel, to take up some of the slack, and that worked a bit better, but not enough. After struggling with this for several months, I gave up on it and bought a much more expensive one hoping I can stop buying dustpans now.The broom is also very stiff bristled, and I found that I used other brooms that I had rather than the one that came with this dustpan, because mainly I'm in search of a great dustpan since there's 5 million brooms available."
421155,1,"It is a woman's ginseng, which I'd never tried. After using it for almost two weeks I felt as though I had more energy than before.

367736,0,"It will work for shaving... I don't like it as much as my old Remington. The indicator lights don't indicate when it is running low, so it just stops. I had the habit of holding my shaver close to the top of the device and on this model the screen release buttons are so big that I hit one and the screen came flying half-off with it on and close to my face and still going. So, I changed my habit on that, but the buttons are unnecessarily large to release the screen. The trimmer seems to be cheaper quality than the earlier model Remington that I had. This one of those fancy looking ""they-don't-make-them-quite-like-they-used-to"" products. BUT, YOU KNOW... it shaves the face. I have gotten used to it and it works in the morning when I need it and it charges fast and well, its a pretty inexpensive electric razor and I needed a new one. So, it works."

If that's all you want, it is great for that because it really does feel like kneading fingers. I had hoped for more, but I'm not sure that I'll find it. I would like a massager that kneads both neck and shoulders and can move up and down a bit. I've found those for the back, but not one that includes the neck. This massager is rather large and heavy also. You have to prop yourself up with pillows to get the best angle and move a lot to get different areas of the neck."

15787,0,"This is a nice pen, and I think that when people see me writing with it they know I am super serious about ink pens. However, this pen is not without flaws. To start it wrote in all caps for the first two weeks I used it. It was very embarrasing because everyone thought I was being a jerk. When I got that mess sorted out the pen would write a letter ""B"" anytime I needed to write a ""P"", and I could never figure out how to get the letter ""S"" to appear. It also claims to be a multi-function pen, but it was completely useless when I tried to check the tire pressure on my car. I would recommend this pen, but only to people who are interested in writing, and only words that do not need an ""S"", ""B"", or ""P"".Thank You."
54690,0,"Took this before I decided to help me cut down back when I began my fitness journey. Is it a legit thermogenic? The answer is yes but really any one of VPX's Redline lineup is superior IMO. In my experience most thermo's only have appetite suppressing effects in the first 4 weeks or so of cycling. The real beauty of them is for HIT or extended cardio to burn those calories. Wasn't disappointed but not something I would buy again. Helpful if you are truly out of shape but if you are cutting- honestly... don't beat around the bush, just take VPX Clenbutrx, that stuff is the truth. I don't recall getting that 'oh it's hot in here' body warm feeling from most thermo's but I can say that it does give a weird berry sort of aftertaste whenever you burp/etc., I wouldn't say it was unpleasant but it's something to consider."
97463,0,"When I was training for a marathon, I suffered from runner's knee and this helped me get through my training and the race. It worked and was cheap, so it was a great solution.I gave it a 3 for two reasons:-Sizing - only available in one size fits all. I'm a smaller woman and it would have been nice to have different sizes. It fit fine, but there was a lot of excess to wrap around.-Lacks plastic loop - I've used the knee strap by Pro-Tec, which has a plastic loop and makes it easier to tighten the strap. The Mueller strap is only a strip, so you have to wrap it around to get it tight, no loop to get some leverage. This wasn't a deal breaker, but it wasn't as easy to use, especially if you are trying to tighten it while on a run.Overall, I recommend it because of the cost. But the other features are nice if you are willing to pay a few extra bucks."

I mean honestly the first thing I thought of, when I sprayed this perfume on is powder! It smells like you're in a makeup room where you powder your nose. Also this scent is more of a grandma scent in my honest opinion. I'm 19 years old and that's what I think of with this perfume. I think it's a bit too strong and mature for younger girls. I don't think guys will be attracted to the scent (At least not in my age group). This is my honest opinion and I hope I can help someone from spending their money and regretting it (like me). From now on I'm just going to buy perfumes at stores AFTER I smell them. Lesson well learned!!!"
254805,0,"I gave these three stars for price and size. I can see, though, that others' complaints that the pads don't hold a lot of liquid are valid. The padded layer is quite skimpy, and the quilted sections are comparatively large. as are the stitches. I'm assuming this means that the moisture can travel along the pad, rather than becoming somewhat trapped into smaller ""cells."" But since my application was only for minor leaks, this wasn't a factor for me.Don't know if I missed this in some of the reviews, but the underside is very slippery. This means that for someone who can navigate into and out of bed, but with effort, due to paralysis on one side, the pad becomes hopelessly rumpled. I won't be ordering this pad again, and I hope I don't have to go with pads in the $20 range to find ones with the type of underlayer that prevents this much bunching.Additional Note:When taking the pad out of the washing machine, I was surprised by a gush of water onto the floor. I think that the source was the underside, which, during the spin cycle, didn't get flattened out. The pad was lumpy, with ""pockets"" or depressions which collected the liquid. It dried perfectly straight again, but getting it from the washer to the dryer could be a nuisance."

Sometimes, during cold/flu season, I sneak in 2/day, but it's far easier to do an immunity tincture of some kind. Fortunately we seem to do fine with a good probiotic, fish oil, and regular doses of chicken soup or other bone broth. It is also low in calcium, which was one of my nutrient worries at the time. I suspect it is a fine formula if your child really needs a boost in the basic nutrients, but you need to be prepared to give him/her six/day!"

147044,0,"I need a gel to use with Nuface Trinity on my face. I use Nuface device to glide over my face, and to lift and hold my skin during the facial treatment. So the gel needs to be pleasant to wear. Most importantly, the gel needs to have the proper thickness to ensure Nuface Trinity's proper gliding or lifting motion. I have tried a bunch of gels. Below are my observations on gels:- Jason Aloe Vera gel: no unpleasant smell like Lily of Desert's, a tiny bit thicker than Lily of desert, but still too watery for Nuface. The downs: irritable to skin. When I use it on my hands which have eczema breakout occasionally, it really stings, and it is not as soothing as Lily of Desert.- Nuface Gel Primer: the ups: the right thickness for Nuface trinity. With the gel primer, the device glides smoothly on skin, but not too fast. The gel also provides enough resistance so that the device can lift and hold skin. The downs: It is expensive. it is a bit irritating when I use it, although there is no lasting effect once I wash it off. For the purpose of Nuface, I've not found a gel that works as well as the gel primer.- Zinc-kite c2 gel: Very pleasant smell, not irritable to skin at all. Though it is a tiny bit thicker than a typical aloe gel, it is still too thin (watery). It is difficult to control the gliding motion of Nuface, and impossible to perform lift/hold motion, as there is no resistance to lift any skin.- Lily of Desert Aloe Vera gel: unpleasant smell, watery, not suitable for Nuface at all. However, it is very soothing. When I have eczema breakout, I apply some on my skin, it ceases the itch right away. So I am glad to have found this product and now it is a must have."

201548,0,"I bought two of these heating pads, one for myself and one for my mother. We loved them at first, the large size was great to get relief for the entire back area. Within a year, both of our pads were trash. My mother's started burning and almost caught fire and my control kept losing it's connection to the pad,(my mother's pad did the same prior to it almost catching fire), I could fumble around with it to get it working here and there but it eventually stopped working completely, $150.00 for 2 heating pads down the drain. I've been using cheap heating pads since and of course they don't compare. I'm looking to buy a new heating pad that would give me the relief that this one did, but I would never purchase this brand again. I think I'm going to invest in a thermophore this time around and hope for better results."

I use this in preference to sprays which dilate the veins in the nose and eventually weaken them to the extent that they can no longer be dilated. Nosovent does the job well with no long term problems.
213806,0,"I puchased quite a bit of this product and no matter the mixture, I was rather disappointed with this. I've changed to jamilla instead, with great results! I'm very pleased with the new choice. This isnt a good one for beginings because its not a good representation of what henna is and can do. I suggest doing a bit more research and finding a reliable distributor who is more familiar with the limitations and needs of henna."
68658,0,"I bought this item after reading the reviews. It is a good item but needs a lot of patience while using.Drawback's:1) Since this is used without a strip, the wax layer that u apply on the skin should be thick enough to be pulled. if the layer applied is thin, the wax will not pull off the body and will remain stuck there.....and as per the instructions, it requires a wax pull off lotion which is not supplied with the box. Since i was using it for the first time, i had a rough time removing the wax from my body as i wasnt aware of the thickness of the wax to be required to be pulled.2) The wax dries off fast while applying, so could do it in small patches which took a lot of time to complete.The only good thing about this wax is that while pulling the layer, it doesn't hurt much.So if you plan to buy this one, don buy it alone. Buy it with the set that has the lotion and spatulas (this is very much required because if u use ur knife...u will just have to throw that)."
138599,0,"I used to use mouthwash regularly until I realized I was swallowing too much of it.My choice was always Listerine. With such an awful taste you know it's got to be good. And it is. Listerine is a very good mouthwash.But mouthwash is not meant for human consumption. Inevitably, we'll swallow some every now and then. Oral pore absorption is also to be considered.I pondered alternatives. One stood out: vodka.Now, alcohol has never appealed to me. Even most wines taste like turpentine to me. However, vodka you can swallow; mouthwash you should not. This one difference was enough to make me switch.I chose Smirnoff vodka for two good reasons: (1) It was nearest the door and (2) it was on sale. I bought a bottle of 80 proof. It also comes in 90 and 100 proof bottles, suitable for those equipped with tougher tongues than mine.According to my dentist, Dr. Teplitsky, vodka kills germs and cleans the mouth. It heals small sores and eliminates plaque. If swallowed accidentally it's not a problem. ""Just don't report me to the AMA,"" he said.""No problem, doc. How about the KGB?""Vodka has helped me overcome sore throats. A once a day gargle/rinse seems to suffice. Of course, this could be extended to twice a day if necessary.True, it is an added expense, but I don't pinch pennies where health is concerned--especially during those cold winter months. And I remain unperturbed when accidentally some goes down."

307915,0,"The back of the box lists the active ingredients: Cinchona 12x, lobelia inf 12x, etc. For those who are unfamiliar with homeopathy, this designation means that these herbs appear in a concentration of 1 part per *trillion*, or the equivalent of a single drop in 20 Olympic-size swimming pools. The pseudoscience behind homeopathy has been proven wrong countless times, yet for some reason people still believe in it.I am betting Living Essentials simply did not want to spend big money on these herbs, so they diluted them to ridiculously low concentrations and slapped the word ""homeopathic"" on the package, a word which a sizeable fraction of Americans probably don't even know the definition of.That said, the product does work. Why? Because of the calcium carbonate and the activated carbon, which are included among the ""inactive ingredients"". The tiny pores on the carbon allow the toxins to adsorb to the pill before they can be absorbed by your body. It is not perfect, and as it travels through your digestive tract toxins can be released, which explains why some people feel like they are still slightly `buzzed' the next day.I have experienced identical results taking any number of generic activated charcoal pills while drinking, and I would suggest those who are wary of paying the big bucks for name brand Chaser to do the same."

261224,0,"Ultra Floss *is* what you are probably looking for, it is a fibrous mesh of loose-fitting synthetic fibers that ends up creating a thicker surface area to drag between your teeth and keep everything clean.All of that is fine and it works great IF you do not have tight teeth.If you have tight teeth, what happens is you tear up the synthetic fibers as you try and saw the string between your teeth and break the floss string; probably requiring you to pull another from the container and then floss stuck fibers out from between your teeth.If you have notoriously close teeth and are used to sawing your way through normal floss, don't get this. It won't work for you.If you have slightly less-close-together teeth and don't recall needing to always saw floss inbetween them when flossing, then this floss is exactly what you were looking for, enjoy!"

I wouldn't use it as an everyday shaving device, but it is good for 'touch ups' here and there between shaves with a manual razor. Also great for travel.Since they can be purchased for $20 or less, I would recommend them. If I was looking for an electric shaver to replace manual shaving, I might try a full size rotary shaver."

A lot of people have complained about the horrible taste of the fiber. Honestely, I thought it was bland, but not bad tasting at all. I mixed with water only and it reminded me of drinking a finely powdered sawdust. It didn't taste bad at all though.Bowel movements were natural and not runny, although they did come with slightly more urgency than normal. After the middle of the second day, my bowels were clean, and the only thing running through me was the fiber and pills I was taking with the kit.After the third day I decided that I like food after all and quit.I feel like the product works, but I think that 5 days is a bit excessive and probably not that healthy to do. If you use this program, I think you could do it for 2-3 days and achieve the same results if you drink enough water."

368264,0,"I've used this epilator for two years and I am buying the second one today, because I dropped the first one and the epilator head doesn't work anymore. Overall, It is a good product and worth the money. I have had more than 15 years of experience with epilators and here are some of the pros and cons of this one, comparing to the other ones I have had:Pros:- You can use in the shower (this is the main reason I am buying this one again).- Virtually pain-free (for me, at least. Remember that I've been using epilators for 15 years. The first time it is always painful), especially if used in the shower.- It is cordless.- It is easy to clean afterwards.- It has a sleek design and it is easy to work in hard to reach areas.Cons:- It is slippery! For a product designed for using wet, it is too slippery and if you drop it, be prepared to buy another one. I tried to buy just the epilator head, but couldn't find it anywhere.- The battery does not last long and it does not work plugged in.- It takes a long time to charge the battery.- it is not the fastest epilator and you have to run it through the same area many times to get all the hairs out.For me it works because I don't have a lot of hairs and only use it once every two weeks for underarms and bikini area and once a month for my legs. After each use, I make sure I charge the battery, so the next time it doesn't die on me. My main complaint is really the slipperiness. I am kind of clumsy and I am sure I will be shopping for a epilator again soon enough (although I don't think I will be buying this one again for the third time)."

For financial reasons I (UNFORTUNATELY) had to use it with both of my children, but I would absolutely never recommend this tub!!!

I will definitely use this as a way to treat him as soon as I see signs he might be getting sick, before the next infection takes root, though. I do think that it will be a good preventative, since it did make a good dent in his symptoms this time around.I found a less expensive and well-reviewed product that comes in a bigger bottle, and that is the only reason I am giving this product 3 stars and not 4.

Also, it's a very nice razor. The stubby handle doesn't bother me. It's design is simple and nice to look at.I was really excited to shave with it, but was highly disappointed in the shave. I've had better shaves using my gf's 2month old leg shaving disposable. An electric would give a closer shave. I'm hoping it's just the Merkur blades, and just ordered some feathers, but I think they come in a standard size and if anything, I think the razor's guard is too wide, not exposing enough blade to get a close shave.It's a really nice razor, and I hope it's just a blade issue, but out of the box, I have to give it two stars because of the horrible shave.60wt"

It might seem a tad high maintenance, but the feature lets the user know when 30 seconds is up and time to move on to a different area of teeth to clean. I am frustrated by (a) the lack of the timer feature and (b) the lack of clarity and information available to me when making the decision. Even the instruction manual states ""not all models."" It seems to me that the Quad Pacer timer should be a feature on all the Sonicare models. I was going to return this model, but chose to keep it--or pass it on to my wife.

My decision was based on the amount of good reviews, the fact that they were vegan and food based. I took them at night with dinner and wasn't nauseated, no heartburn, but within an hour I did have a terrible stomach ache with terrible gas!!!! I felt sorry for my husband. My apologies for being so graphic but I think women should know that this might be a potential side effect for them as well. I decided to give them another day thinking I needed to get used to the pills or perhaps I had eaten something bad. Same thing the second time around. Therefore, I have stopped taking them and am back to doing my homework. Remember....every woman is different. These pills may work for some and be a nightmare for others.

353048,0,"If you are looking for a constant source of heat that will last more than 15 minutes, this is NOT your product. If you've ever tried the ""home remedy"" equivalent to this microwave heat pad (uncooked rice in a sock then microwaved) it is about the same. The major (or minor depending on how you look at it) difference between the two is that this product does produce ""moist heat"" (the rice does not). However one MAJOR drawback of this product (which you won't read anywhere in the descriptions, until you buy it and get it home) is that you need to WAIT 2 HOURS before you can use it again. Since the heat only lasts about 15 minutes, it is a major hassle (for me) to wait 2 hours before microwaving it again! If you can get by with 15 minutes of heat only (then a 2 hr wait), and need the ""moist heat"" aspect... this product works as advertised. If you are like me and were looking for something to provide heat for more than 15 minutes, then try the rice in sock. At least after the heat wares off, you can pop it back into the microwave and use it again."
353330,0,"This Medline walker may be less expensive than other brands, such as Dana Douglas (the Lexus of walkers), or Invacare or Nova walkers (about mid-range quality brands), but as the old saying goes ""you get what you pay for.""While this walker worked fine for me at first, after a year of steady use it has already broken down to the point of being quite unusable; it rattles a lot now, and one of the wheels has bent, so that it is almost impossible to use except in a straight line. With even slight turns, I now must wrestle with it, to get it to turn. I often have to pick the whole thing up and reposition it. This is both awkward and painful. If you already have mobility and/or pain issues, it makes those issues worse if you have to wrestle with a walker to make it work. I am now shopping for a higher quality (albeit more expensive) brand, such as those mentioned above. It will be worth it to pay more for a walker that will stand up to daily use (including folding for transport in cars), and that will not give out so soon."

44468,0,"I bought this razor and blades because I couldn't find my usual (and loved) Venus Embrace blades and had heard good things about these blades so figured hey, couldn't hurt to try, well it didn't hurt, but these blades give my legs a lousy shave, I had to go over my legs a good 3 times and I STILL had stubble because of the stupid wire strips across the blades, yes I know they're there to prevent razor cuts. Good news I didn't cut myself and I didn't have razor burn after all that hassle. They did do a good job on my arm pits too. The blades do have a pretty long lifespan too, which is another plus for the price.The razor itself, I like the control and the way the razor head moves better then my Venus, it's much smaller and more flexible, but that doesn't help any if the blades themself suck, which they do.Definitely not worth it."

151246,0,"I bought a couple of pairs of these a few years ago and they are tough and I have liked them. They have out-lasted all the other magnifiers I have bought. I would have given these glasses a 5 star review but the manufacturer has doubled the price. I can see raising the price due to the increase in manufacturing costs but to double the price just because they are popular and gouging people really raises my hackles. I am sure I have sold quite a few of these glasses myself over the years just from 'word of mouth' recommendation. You consumers go ahead and decide if they are worth the price to you. I am just annoyed because when people have less money it is criminal to double the price on something like this. Yes, the quality is decent (better than Chinese goods) and the glasses are handy but I must say I was shocked to see the current price. Inflation? No, gouging the public in a recession.March 2011 update: I must say these glasses are sturdy and have outlasted all my other drug store 'cheaters'. But I am sorta annoyed that the manufacturer is now gouging people to the tune of about 30 bucks a pair! WOW! That is almost double what I paid for my two pair back a few years ago. Sheesh! I know everything has gone up, but 29.99? I paid 16.99 a pair for them."
416025,0,"The first time I ordered this product, I was thrilled. It was so easy to just order it instead of going to the store. The product smells great, and works great.However, the shipment is another story. My first shipment was no problem all, but the 2nd and 3rd shipments were a nightmare.I never even received the 2nd shipment because it must have busted at the sort facility and they returned it to Amazon. I placed an order for a 3rd time, and it arrived today, but the box was SOAKED. Several bottles were bashed and the softener had ran out of the tops (the lids are not very secure). I didn't return it, but cleaned the bottles off and counted my losses. I was disappointed. This product does not ship well."

95167,0,Does a fair job shaving my beard but not as good as the better braun I always had. I enjoyed the better price shaver but had to change because you added the cleaninmg fluied to the better shaver. Most men do not want liquard sitting around the top of our barthroom counter. The children can knock it over and cause problms. Bring back the top of the line shaver without any liquard.
263513,2,"After about 2 months of use, I started having problems with it shutting itself off and showing an F1 on the display. It would not reset itself until I unplugged it for a few minutes. In July, I called the warranty department and was shipped a new one. This one worked for about a month before the pad started shutting itself off and showing a code of F2. At this point, I have asked for a different model as a replacement. Sunbeam has been very cooperative."
236157,2,"The insane, enduring popularity of this cologne absolutely confounds me. It is instantly recognizable for its cloying, sickly sweet middle tones. It's incredibly aggressive, like lemon pledge gone bad. Do your neighbors on the subway a major service and stop using this vile product."

273303,0,"I love this particular vitamim C product. And I use the capsules. Even though vegitabs appears in the large link, each quantity is either blank or states 'caps' and apparently what I ordered were horse-pill sized tablets. The listing only mentions 'caps' quantities with the assumption, on their part, that the unlabeled quantities are tablets. kind of confusing. I asked to return the product same day that I received it but Amazon wanted me to pay return postage (I ordered this product with Amazon prime). Ultimately the customer service person agreed with me re: ad being unclear and didn't charge me but it wasn't easy to convince her. Generally Amazon product descriptions are very clear and this one is an exception. The product ad is not intentionally misleading but it isn't completely clear either. How much trouble is it to label quantities as 'tabs' or 't' if you list 'caps'? Rather than reorder I bought the caps from a local health food store, paid a few dollars more and supported tne local economy so all worked out. But a bit of an eye-opening experience."
184733,0,I bought these about 4 weeks after my first little boy was born. The pee pee tee pee works ok when I'm giving him a bath if it's soaking wet to give it weight. They arent wide enough to go around to keep it on there so they don't pee everywhere. If the baby doesn't move at all while you are changing him they works great. I recommend them for sure with baths. They're super funny too.
425550,1,This was money well spent. I have been using a makeup mirror for over ten years and this is by far the best one I've found. It has great lighting and the side mirrors that fold closed are an added bonus. I would absolutely recommend this mirror and would buy it again.

94818,1,"I started taking this after going two weeks of feeling bloated and over full from anything I ate. The lady at the health food store told me about it and said it helped her as well. She said that it was a bit strong and to take it in the middle of your meal if it hurts your stomach. The first time I took it with a meal it helped me so much! When I take it with my meal, I don't feel so ill afterward. I have really liked it, and feel so much better with it. You can also sprinkle it on your food, if you don't want to take it in pill form."
366337,0,"I was surprised how stiff this support is... usually they're a little more flexible. Also, it has a hard time staying up on the top of the chair. Maybe the elastic is weak. But once we safety-pinned it into place is does give pretty good support."
424707,1,"Every type of food or drugs or vitamins works diff on people, i can say this worked on both my husband and I.

235152,0,"Two shipments were required to get some of this product to me in the bottle. The first shipment had completely leaked out into the envelope. Amazon required that I ship the soggy envelope back to them for credit! The second shipment had only leaked about 20% into the plastic bag it had been placed in, inside a box. Perhaps Amazon could invest in some tape to secure the lids on liquid products. Fortunately I could enjoy the minty fresh sent while cleaning up the mess."

269550,0,"Although it says ""Low Foam Formula"" on the product description, I didn't imagine that it would barely lather up. Basically, the way it applied to my skin is exactly like a lotion. I had to use tons to get full facial coverage. This stuff is expensive and won't last very long because of how much you have to use per shave. Is it better than Edge? Yes, but it is not cost efficient."
196670,0,"I have 4b hair and heard a lot of good things about this product. Therefore, I purchased it and could not wait for my wash day.

But for now, I don't think I will buy it again."
204329,2,"The sound quality is pretty good for this machine but it has a tendency to short out after some usage. The first time it did this I thought it was a fluke and I bought another one. However, after using the same model for a little while it started to short out again. You can play with the knob and get it too work but it eventually stops working. I have to replace it again but I will not buy this brand again"
228875,0,The concept is great -- concentrated energy in a tasty bar -- but they are so tough and chewy -- ever tried to eat one halfway thru a hike? It's like trying to swallow cardboard -- I need to drink ALOT of liquid when I have one of these bars -- why not make then juicier???This would be good in a camp setting-- it takes alot of chews to really get this one down.If you have any loose dental work -- use the goo or the gel instead.

The phone number provided is a voice mailbox, and they say they will get back you in 24-48 hours. I'm still waiting after two messages left in three days.They also say in their voicemail announcement that replacement parts cost $9.99, which is almost what I paid for the cane itself.It's supposed to be collapsible, but that was extremely difficult to do the few times I tried it."
300790,0,"The oil smells lovely, but is not quite what I expected. I have a sandalwood sculpture as well as sandalwood incense and the oil doesn't smell like them.

333496,1,"I have uploaded several photos of the unit, including everything it came with.I bought this as a replacement unit for my old Braun 5550, which after a few years of use has finally died.I have yet to try to cleaning unit, but here is a breakdown of the time it should take to clean, according to the manual:1) Charge - Approx 1 Hour2) Clean/Dry/Charge - Approx 3 Hours3) Clean/Dry - Approx 3 Hours4) Dry/Charge - Approx 2 hrs 50 mins5) Dry - Approx 2 hrs 50 minsThe manual recommends replacing the ""HydraClean"" detergent cartridge every 30-40 days. They also include an alternative method to clean -- using liquid soap and water.Replacement Parts & Accessories (Retail prices & model # as indicated in insert):1) Protective Cap (WES8044X7158): $0.622) Outer Foil (WES9085PC): $35.003) Inner Blades (WES9064PC): $21.954) Charging Adapter (WES8044K7658): $16.115) Self-Cleaning Recharger (WES8078H4218): $41.896) Detergent Cartridge 3-pack (WES035P): $9.99Pros:- The Panasonic Vortex is relatively light, and easy to hold/grip.- Wet/Dry: One of the main features that won me over. I decided to get this unit instead of the Braun Activator because of this feature. I usually shave right after I take a shower, and my old Braun wouldn't cut cleanly until I fully dried off. First thing I did when I received this unit was to try shaving after a shower -- worked perfectly.- Speed: For my old shaver, I had to take several passes, and yet still missed stubs here and there. With the Vortex, I was able to shave cleanly in one quick pass. I'm impressed!Cons:- After my shave, my skin got a bit irritated. However, I'm sure my skin may just need a little time to adjust.- Came with a cheap travel bag."
14122,0,The gel seems to go a lot faster than the lotion and does not lubricate the same. The gel is easily disolved in water and its effects are minimal.
422034,0,"This product arrived exploded in the box...I'm not sure why, as the cap was screwed on tight and the flip top was securely closed, so I don't really know how it could have gotten out besides the person packing saw that it was leaking, closed it up, and send it off with cream everywhere...?Anyways, about the product, I didn't find that it was anything special. It didn't help with ingrown hairs or moisturize any better than using a plain unscented lotion from the drugstore. It definitely didn't help slow hair grown, in my opinion. I don't know, maybe my hair grows freakishly fast or something, but I've found I get maybe 2 weeks, certainly not 4 before having to deal with regrowth. I didn't think it was anything special, and it seems kind of overpriced to me. I've found that the best way to deal with ingrown hairs is to 1) exfoliate well, and 2)moisturize with a plain, unscented lotion (St. Ives or tons of drugstore brands have inexpensive good ones), and 3) use tea tree oil I apply it with a cotton ball and I seriously never get ingrown hairs when I do that."
85683,0,"I use it personally. Don't care for the fragrance, but if it cleans, I won't argue. Tough to bathe everynight, so every other night I just do a quick wipe down. Just microwave for short time to warm up towelettes. They are pretty thick and easy to use. Just need to pick up the no rinse shampoo now."
370958,0,I am giving this a 3 star. the product is good but the method of shipping or packaging is inadequate. I ordered multiple boxes and they were all melted.

357445,0,"I've been taking these Holy Basil softgels for a while now and I'd be hard pressed to say that I've noticed any difference. Certainly not enough for me to warrant buying them again or recommending them. But everyone reacts differently and what may be effective for you might not be so for me.I even stopped taking them after two weeks and did not notice any drop in mood or other issues that might indicate they were working for me or not. I started taking them again several days ago and again noticed no change. To be fair, I'm normally light spirited anyway, and reached spiritual enlightenment years ago. ;) Seriously, I don't have any of the ""aliments"" Holy Basil is said to effect, at least not ones that are easily measured.This herbal supplement comes well packaged and appears to be a quality product no matter what it's final effect is or isn't. The softgels smell nice and feel good in the mouth, easily swallowed. I did notice slightly more indigestion during the time I was taking it, but can't pin that on the supplement. But other reviewers mentioned it too so it is worth mentioning.These pills are a bit pricey, so with no noticeable benefit, I will not be getting a re-fill."

184564,2,"For some reason, even after reading the largely positive reviews of the more expensive, higher-model-number Remington shavers, and the largely negative reviews of this cheaper one, I still went the cheap route. For the benefits I've received so far, I think I would have been better off just sticking with my old razor.The shaver has been fine on my legs - not very efficient, or quiet, but it hasn't caused any damage and if I'm careful enough I get a pretty close shave. It does seem like I have to shave more often, though. What's really bad is what happened to my armpits: painful red welts for several days! Reading the other reviews, it seems I'm not the only one with this experience.The two positive things I can say about this shaver are that it does hold a charge for as long as I need it to, and I like being able to shave dry. However, you could probably get these benefits and better performance with a more expensive model."

We didn't like having to change and buy more moisture pads. The warm wipes are nice and i found Dex is just as good...we've never had a problem with dried out wipes or wipes turning brown. As for pop-up wipes we found the Costco brand wipes are pop up and fit better than the pampers or huggies wipe...plus they are cheeper.

247568,0,"I purchased the BodyGroom over a year ago, but had to throw it away recently. All in all it was a good product for the price, but seems to lack durability over the long run.The good:Product held a charge very well and worked in and out of the shower. The three blade covers gave a good variety of shave levels. Shaving (no guard) produced little irritation to the skin (when used wet) and worked quite effectively. The blades did not become jammed/clogged at all unless trying to remove too much hair at one time (like using the shortest guard when hair had grown to full length).The bad:After the first few months, and infrequent blade changes, the blade covers would occasionally pop off during use, causing the razor to shave down to the skin. This could be controled by holding the blade cover steady, but was a bit of a pain. I also had a problem with the switch getting stuck in the ""on"" position. This was resoved by simply placing it on the charger (would not run while on the charger), but again, was a bit of a pain.All in all, given the inexpensive price, it is a good shaver if you want to try it out for the first time, or if you are someone who prefers complete hair removal (blade guard issue would not apply to you)."

148071,0,After using this shaving set for about a year and a half the badger brush separated. Changing out the razor blades is now difficult as the mount that holds the razor falls off the holder. The set looks good however I should have spent the extra money to purchase a good quality one.
68250,0,"I have used this steam mop cleaner on my floor several times now. Granted it does a good job but the sponge obviously gets dirty quickly and there seems to be no way to replace it. It worked well on my carpet for cleaning some yogurt my daughter had dropped several days earlier and also curry. I think it is a bit expensive for the work it does. I wish it had a wider path so I wouldn't have to spend ages cleaning the floor. Also extra sponges and where to get them would be good. Hoover.com doesn't seem to have any advice. It would be nice if Hoover would make a cheaper version of the spinbrush but this is the poor man's solution really.It is non-toxic and with kids around and several allergies, that's great.I've given it 3 stars because it wants to be a jack of all trades and doesn't quite acomplish it."

193844,2,The description of this product sounded promising but it does not work as advertised. I applied it and have allowed various amounts of time for it to dry.

IMHO this product is over priced and doesn't work as advertised.

203840,0,"I was out shopping the other morning and noticed a couple of display boxes of these acubead's, right next to the cashier so I decided what the heck; I'd give it a try, They were only 99 cents. Later that day, I put one on my right ear for a headache, that was excruciating for me, and about 40 minutes later the pain was still there, but not as bad, So I decided to lay down and take a nap, upon getting up, the pain was gone. I figured o.k. I'll give them that, so next I applied the slenderbead. LOL, and I've since been over eating, it seems as if I'm always hungry. So those came off real quick. I'm hoping that others will write a review on these products I'm not going to be fast and say that the slenderbead didn't work, (The past week, I had just began working out so I'm thinking this could attest to me always being hungry)but after I get really into my routine of the gym and diet, I'll try to use it again. One big surprise for me is the fact that any metal's other than pure gold and silver gives me a rash, I don't care how hypoallergenic they claim to be, but for some reason they never gave me a rash nor made me itch, I guess that would be the titanium that is used for the bead, so that is a big plus for me. Other than that it was not bad for ninety nine cents."

296781,0,"As a person who needs to wear a knee brace on an everyday- all day basis, I found one important fault with this brace. The back of the brace has some sort of mesh material that is abrasive on the back of the leg right at the bending position and makes it uncomfortable to wear. When you first put the brace on, it feels good. After wearing it for about an hour, you feel the mesh cutting in to the back of the knee and it hurts. I then have to place a tissue inside the brace to block the mesh from the back of the leg and that is not an easy thing to do. Also the top of the brace tends to fold over.I actually like the way the rest of the brace is structured and hope that eventually the mesh softens enough for everyday wear. I think that the description should state that the mesh exists and maybe even why they chose to add it to the product."

290482,2,"This web works OK as a hand exerciser (though I barely used it) - my problem was with the smell. It was STRONG! It made my whole room stink of rubber/plastic. I washed it in soap and water many times - no improvement. When I used it, my hands would stink. I grew to hate the smell. I finally set it outside in the sun in hopes it would eventually outgas and stop stinking. No luck - it stunk even after the UV degraded the rubber material and it all fell apart. So I threw it away.At Physical Therapy, I used a different brand of web exerciser, and it did not stink. So maybe some other brand doesn't have the same problem. The concept is good, the material choice of this brand was horrible."

150072,0,"Firstly, I am a regular user of fountain pens, and I own and use a variety of fountain pens of different price ranges.The Pilot Ecrino, as in my title, is a decent pen. It has a nice appearance and size. The cap is screw-type; I prefer this to snap caps, but others may disagree. The clip feels nice and sturdy. The pen is light; I would prefer a heavier feel.The ring around the cap that says ""ECRINO"" is just a sticker. Although the sticker is of high quality, it still seems to degrade from the quality of the pen. The overall finish also does not match up with nice pens like Pelikans or Parkers.The pen requires a Pilot converter or cartridge to provide ink. I filled mine with Noodler's Black at first. The nib is reasonably smooth and writes nicely, albeit too dry for my ideal preferences. Wet inks seem to work better. As can be expected, the fine nib is about the same width as a Western extra-fine. I have heard that this pen has the same nib as the Pilot Lucina.At the time of my purchase, this pen was on sale for $32. In my opinion, is it worth that price? Yes, very much. I am considering purchasing another with a wider nib. But the list price of $60 seems too much for this pen. For $60, I would recommend a Pelikan M150 or a Cross--these pens have a nicer finish and provide a nicer writing experience."

This particular version I'd read multiple complaints about so my husband bought me the supposedly much better one with loofah's to rub your feet on and 5 massage heads.

The jets felt okay, the vibration attachments on the bottom of each side tickled and the loofah works..well..like a loofah..but only on the bottom of your feet since they are flat and planted in the plastic. Unfortunately for you, you won't get any of the ticklers and loofah because you are buying this one. That was the only part I liked!They are messy, cool off way too fast, not fun to clean..especially if you leave dirty water in there for over an hour.. and I was shorted one of the massage heads. I'm not thrilled, think Conair needs to give up or work miracles on future versions and have only used it once since receiving it for Christmas.

7186,0,"initially excited about this product. Must say after 1st use, I haven't used it again. It's cumbersome to use because it's heavy to carry after filling it with water. I do like the fact that the water continues to be heated. One of the things I originally liked was the pumice stone. But it's in a position, where you have to take your foot out of the water to use and even then it's not that effective. So if your primary objective is to use it for exfoliating, it's not very good at that."
387871,0,"I got 2 for D batteries. They do the job if I charge them twice.One of the channels is wonkers, but it does work.The quickest way to ruin rechargeables is to overheat them. These chargers create a lot of heat with the D batteries. I monitor them myself. That pretty much sucks, but I want a lot of life out of my expensive batteries. On the dead D's, they charge until the light goes off, but at that point they ARE NOT fully charged. I unplug and plug back in and the same batteries will charge again for half as much time. So, it either doesn't fully charge, it overheats and shuts off or it doesn't sense the charge. My money is on a less than adequate charge since, after many runs, I can predict the times that the thing will shut off. If it is from heat, then maybe a note in the manual could suggest that after charging a set of D's, cool and charge again.These are big, heavy and a pain, but they are cheaper and do charge. If I could get a better smart charger for 4 D batteries without breaking the bank, I would. As is, you get what you pay for."

162604,0,"The active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is the ideal antiseptic skin cleanser. According to all available medical literature on the internet, a 2% solution kills a broad spectrum of micro-bacteria on contact. The chemical has a positive charge and binds to bacteria that is negatively charged. This electrical action weakens the bacterial cell membrane wall and allows for easier penetration by the killing properties of the chemical. Because human tissue is also negatively charge, the agent also binds to human skin for the next five to six hours. As a result, the affected area inhibits bacterial growth..Its effective antiseptic action was demonstrated in one medical study with chronically ill children. Daily bathing with the stuff reduced bacterial growth by 35%..This is not to say that the product is without risk. It is well documented that exposure to the eye and mid-ear causes damage. According to federal records, there were 403 reported cases of adverse reactions to chlorhexidine gluconate. As expected, a majority was negative skin reaction..The recommended strength is 2%, but Hibiclens comes in a 4% solution. As a result, it is very potent - twice the strength of the active ingredient used in the various medical studies. Because of its effectiveness, this product is the standard. Physicians wash their hands with the product before surgery; and hospitals require patients to clean their surgical sites with the agent before their operations..The only objection is the price. At $56.74 plus $6.40 for shipping, $63.14 is very expensive. . . . It is worse at the local drug stores. The average price is $12 per 8 oz. That is $192 for a gallon of Hibiclens..A cheaper alternative is to buy CSR Chlorhexidine Solution on the amazon.com website for $13.78, $8.79 with a $4.99 shipping. It is a straight 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution without the added fragrance and red dye. The absence of these two unnecessary ingredients with a weaker concentration tends to reduce skin irritation. Although it is half the strength of Hibiclens, the 2% active ingredient has enough killing power because almost all the medical studies used this ratio..As an added advantage, the product does not foam like Hibiclens. As a result, you can put a few ounces into your spray cleaner bottle or mop bucket and sanitize your floors, counter-tops, and furniture..The only objection is that CSR Chlorhexidine Solution is marketed as a pet product. . . . If that bothers you, pour a little red food dye and cheap cologne into the container. . . . You now have Hibiclens at a 2% concentration - the recommended strength in almost all of the medical studies."
366085,0,"Recently I've developed sensitivity to ammonia-containing permanent haircolor, so when my roots started showing, I searched high and low and found this brand of a plant-based colorant. My hair is naturally dark brown but I had it lightened to about light brown over the summer. I wanted to get it back to natural, so I bought shade 4N ""Natural Chestnut"". The directions are straight-forward and other than a few grammatical errors, it was not too bad for a foreign company (Naturtint is based out of Spain). I followed the instructions precisely: application was not too bad, it is a little more liquid than other hair color brands I had used, but it doesn't drip much. It will stain your skin if you don't wipe it off right away. After waiting for 30 minutes (normal time, I don't know where one of the reviewers got ""20 minutes""), I rinsed it off. I was a bit concerned about the amount of dye that was rinsing out of my hair right away. I mean, after 2 shampoos and conditioning, the water was still running black. I should not have been concerned though - when I looked in the mirror, my hair was BLACK. Not medium brown (which I wanted), not even dark brown (which I could have lived with), no, it was very dark black. At this rate, I think that I would have to go with the dark blonde shade to get the medium brown that I wanted. It did leave my hair shiny and less damaged than the ammonia-based dye and my sensitive scalp was less itchy. But if you want to try using this color, I would recommend buying a color 2 shades lighter than your intended shade to achieve the desired result. I think I will wait 2 weeks (avoiding the mirror and fencing off ""Why in the world is your hair black?"" comments) and then try the dark blonde shade unless the haircolor lightens with daily washing. I am actually looking forward to the fading on this one and hope that some of the reviewers were right when they said it faded quickly."

It takes kinda funky and too much sugar. After drinking this, you feel really bloated but never satisfied. These weight gainers do not beat an actual meal. I found myself only gaining a couple of pounds, none of which proved to be significant. I blame it on my body structure and fast metabolism. It worked for my roommate, so I would recommend it."

So I came here to read reviews on other models, and was pretty hyped up about all the positive reviews of the pulsonic model. I ordered it, looked great and took it for a test drive.Well, I was very disappointed. It really didn't provide the closeness that everyone claimed it does. It left quite a lot of stubble and long hairs on my face. I thought, well, maybe I need an adjustment period, but day after day the same thing.Finally, I decided to use my old braun after shaving with the pulsonic and I couldn't believe how much hair my older model started clearing off my face. I could hear the blades cutting all the hair the newer model had left behind!Well, needless to say, I have returned the product back to Braun for a refund. I am still using my older model and have decided to just order the same one again. Very big disappointment on what was supposed to be this great new technology."
203949,2,"I went back and to edit this because since I bought this machine, it has gotten worse!Randomly during the night it will make the sound of a radio not tuned right (a really loud EEEHHHHHH that wakes you right up).Also, it began simply going silent for long periods of time. Then it will suddenly begin again (usually waking my husband and/or me up when it does so, startling us out of sleep) This has been getting steadily worse over the last two months.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!Previous review:I need background noise to help me sleep. My old sound machine broke so I purchased this one.The louder it gets the more white noise you can hear with the sounds.The sound clips are also short enough for you to hear the repetitions within the recording, which happens about every 3 seconds. This can be pretty annoying if you notice it while trying to fall asleep.All in all, I would prefer this to nothing at all but in the future I would probably check machines to see how long the recording loop is.It would also be worth it to me in the future to spend a bit more money on a better recording quality."
51272,0,"I don't know how it's possible, but like other reviewers, I find it to be more painful than waxing. It is not just uncomfortable. Maybe it is painless for some, but it is extremely painful for me. But I have lots of very thick hair. Plus the sound it makes is psychologically jarring. I always cringe when it's on! It hurts a little less if you use that Smooth Away product that supposedly removes hair (it doesn't remove much, but I think it gets rid of those tiny, invisible hairs that still hurt like crazy to yank out at the root).If I could feel no pain, i would love it. It is so quick and easy to use every day. Although I always think it's going to pinch my skin, it never has. If you're brave, or have very fine hair, it's great. Otherwise, it just collects dust b/c you're too scared to use it!"

153778,0,"I had great success for many years with a Bona mop and Bona cleaners and floor refresher for my hardwood floors. But I needed a new mop because the velcro wasn't sticking very well due to cat hairs and such that couldn't be cleaned off...and, ahem, someone (read: husband) failed to wash the microfiber pad after using it(he denies using it on anything other than the floor but I still think he must have used it to clean tools or something else inappropriate) and it had turned rather hard. I had gotten plenty of use out of both, so it was time to replace. The good news: I ordered the Bona kit from Amazon, and it arrived very quickly. The bad news: A plastic connector on the new mop handle fell apart within 30 seconds of use. I duct-taped. Then the mophead also fell off. The handle is a different design from my older Bona mop. (The mophead connection seems to have same design flaw; I had long ago duct-taped the mophead onto my old mop handle.) The good news: I wrote to Bona's customer service email address, and they very promptly replaced the mop -- with a mop handle in the older design, which screws together rather than having the plastic snap connector. And as a surprise bonus, the replacement came with the two cleaning pads too. The oh-well, it-works-OK news: I had to duct-tape the mop head onto the replacement mop too. Bottom line -- poor new mop handle design, good customer service from Bona, cleaning pads and products work very well. But keep the duct tape handy for when your mophead falls off."

250289,0,"Unlike most women here, I did not purchase the test to see what my fertility is as I never intend to have kids. Rather, I'd been feeling fatigued of late and very irritable before my periods and not as enthusiastic about exercise as I normally am. While I have been heat-sensitive all my life and overall a winter person, approaching the dreadful age of 30 made me wonder if my heat sensitivity was increasing and whether these could be hot flashes.So I wanted to see if there are any hormonal indications of perimenopause.I did it on the 4th day but I read that it's close enough to the 3rd day that it will yield an accurate result. (at least the bias won't be toward obtaining the desired negative one).I got a barely visible slim line which was hard to compare to the test one, like the reviewer pointed out. I am assuming that is a negative result and based on fsh or this fsh test, I can say that the fatigue and heat sensitivity stem from something else-overtraining and/or vitamin deficiency or maybe stress (recent Phd plus overseas move) and I suppose irritability and fatigue can simply be pms since they are most pronounced prior to the period.As a last note-the manual included gave zero info on the fsh test--it had instead info regarding other types of tests provided by the same company and I had to look it up online. This is at least a minus star-why include a manual for pregnancy tests if this has nothing to do with a pregnancy --and the person buying it has no intention of ever being pregnant (nor any possibility for that matter)!Yes, a cheap alternative that might put your mind at ease--though as you can read up on, fsh can bounce around and the low point of the curve might mislead you to think you have a normal level. I am wondering-does anybody get a high level (two strips of darker color) with this test?"

I gather I am still rather slight in comparison to these men in the chest; expanded chest size being very important to the proper wear of this contraption.As a result the XS size does not fit properly (baggy across the collarbones and in the hollow of the shoulder and runs up my neck. It offers no support or stability to my shoulder.If you are female, slight like me- with a bra size less than a 34whatever - you are better off using a standard ace bandage with icy hot for support and heat of your shoulder. Save yourself the money...Men - This product probably is awesome for you."

109877,0,"I've had to revise my original review, having finally gotten past my initial objection. I first ordered this product as a replacement for I initially chose this Yerba Prima Botanicals product after some research, hoping it would prove to be a fair replacement for the Genesis Today 4 Fiber powder, which I'd found to be effective and at least somewhat palatable, but, unfortunately, is no longer available for purchase through Amazon. My first experience with this this psylu did not prove to be a happy one. No sooner did I mix it with water than it became a thick sludge that I found difficult to drink. It wasn't that it tasted so awful - it was that it was just impossible to drink or even gulp down. Adding water did not help. However, while scrambling to figure out a replacement, I struggled through in order to get some intake of fiber. While the taste didn't grow on me, I did discover that it worked as promised. I've modulated my opinion on this product a bit and believe that if one can get past its sometime gelatinous consistency, this is a beneficial product. My recommendation is to raise the glass to your lips as soon as possible after setting down the spoon with which you stir it. The more time the mix has to absorb the water, the harder it will be to drink."

He said they were good ""every day clippers"". Being a pro, I took his advice.While I can stay that they do good for what they were made for (lining/trimming), they are not good for what I was going to use them for.. cutting thick 1/4 to 1/2 inch hair to bald every 3-4 weeks. I typically like to run an electric all over, get me to that ""1-2 days of growth"" look and then hit it with a multi-blade razor to get that baby butt smooth. This one worked fine the first few strokes but it definitely showed it's weakness as I used it. Binds up quickly. Blades don't have the travel they need to be effective against thick hair.While it's good at what it does, don't expect it to perform miracles. I've since switched to a Wahl Balding Razor and it's night and day difference for how I use it."

198048,0,"I bought this approximately one year ago when it was only $16.99. It worked well... much better than regular (manual?) toothbrushes and my dentist noticed a difference. I like that it signals after 2 minutes of brushing time since I tend to not brush long enough otherwise. Maybe that's why my dentist noticed a difference.The toothbrush broke after about 9 months of use. No biggie for a toothbrush that was less than $20. However, as I am writing this review the toothbrush is selling for $40, which makes it not worth it anymore. I have since upgraded to the ""Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush"" which I also ordered from Amazon. It's priced at $48 and I would definitely recommend spending that extra $8. The ""Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush"" feels like it has more rotations per minute, and just feels much better in general. I am going to assume that it will last me more than 9 months as well."

I've never had trouble swallowing pills until now.Other than that I guess it works decently. I haven't really noticed a substantial difference but I've only been taking it for 3 or 4 days now. Using it to supplement with Piracetam & I've had no headaches, but I'm gonna try to return this and find a different brand of choline so that my supplementation doesn't turn into a daily round of fear factor."

62449,0,"Don't bother with this product. There are way too many negative reviews. Amazon also offers the same style from Sunbeam for only $5.95. Wish I would have noticed that before I ordered mine. When using this one, you must feel the brush to make sure that you are brushing against the grain, or you will end up with more lint/filth than when you started. I also had a problem with the plastic housing (on 1 side), that grabs the lint to store. That part broke off with just a couple of days use. I was able to superglue and tape it back on. Hope it last. Since I primarily use mine for animal hair, I wish it were made to be able to clean (wash)it better. It's almost impossible without getting water in the lint storage area."

344733,0,"I bought this to mix into recipes for my hair & skin. I'm a Brown-American with 4a/4b kinky-curly hair and combination, acne-prone skin. Your hair needs this! It is great in a leave-in, as it balances ph; thus softening & banishing frizz, as well as nourishing with nutrients. A thin layer on the face heals, balances (like a toner), calms, moisturizes, and creates a glow. When used regularly, it banishes my moderate acne. I only recently had to taste it because I developed a sudden severe stomach ache/nausea attack/urge to vomit after taking Naproxen. I did not know if it was either a type of acid reaction or an ulcer, but I had no Pepto or Tums or anything. I drank two fluid ounces of this juice... worked like a charm! I will continue to take it 1-2x daily, incase I do have an ulcer... it will heal the stomach lining. Someone compared the taste to the drink pregnant women take for the glucose screening... not true. I think she got her drinks mixed up. The glucose drink tastes like uber sweet orange Kool-Aid. This tastes like the stuff they give you before surgery or delivery, that takes away your appetite and whatnot. YES. THAT STUFF. THE ABSOLUTE MOST HORRIBLE DRINK IN THE WORLD. This juice is a mild version of that. It has an uber tart/bitter taste that I could not block out, even with my nose closed. Adding about 1.5 oz of orange juice made it palatable for me, but I took away two stars because having to mix it with a vitamin C drink makes it dangerous, due to a preservative already present in this juice. For that reason alone, I will not purchase this brand again. I've been referred to George's, which is tasteless :) and Lily of the Valley, which is nastier :( but preservative-free."

326537,0,"I was disappointed with this brand of oolong... it tastes very much like a 2-minute cup of Lipton black tea to me. Oolong should be sweet and full but dainty, and give you a ""full"" sensation after drinking it. This brand tastes very much like black tea, and had enough tannin in it to leave a film on top of tea that had cooled... which is too much.The tea bags are also on the small side, holding about half the amount of tea as I expected, and are not of the flow-through variety. Currently I'm drinking Organic Magnolia Oolong Tea by Choice, which cost about $3 for 20 tea bags, and is much more satisfying for discriminating oolong drinkers."

You have to start slow with any detox product, even this. I felt like I was coming down with the flu, but another friend of mine in alternative treatments said that was a detox response to me getting rid of toxins in the liver and body. Ugh. Plenty of lemon water andeven a short stint in a sauna helped to get the toxins out of my system.I felt great after five days; lost some weight to boot. Now I do drink, like socially. So I take one an hour before going out and feel much better the next day.I have friends who do up Mardi Gras bigtime and go on a 10-day long detox with this afterwards. (They need it. LOL)I take one tablet before bedtime most evenings, I dont have that ""wakeup"" at 2-3 am when your body has your liver ""flush""..I've tried other brands, but they dont seem to have the amount of silymarin and other herbal cleansers in them.This is my story with this.

105522,0,I've been on this cleansing program for about 2 weeks. I sometimes feel my intestines being squeezed but I think it's psychological. In all I think it works depending on the how many pills you take. You start off with one of each (the herb and fiber) and then increase it until you have a couple bowel movements per day. I take 3 of each pill in the morning and night and I really don't want to take more even though it doesn't seem to do what it says except make me feel like I have a constant stomachache. It's really bearable but just seems like a lot of pills to put in my body. But since it's temporary I suppose it is okay.

146020,0,"Pros: Does a great job of cleaning teeth, and it's easy and comfortable to use.However, it's not without problems. First off, mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic. Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two. I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint, however, is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well). It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.

330257,0,"Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090 is my first electric shaver ever and I've been using it for 7 months now. I had been pondering on whether to take Brown Pulsonic or Philips Norelco for quite a while, when ultimately it was probably the looks of the latter that prevailed so I ended up with it.All in all it is a pretty good shaver, but not great. Perhaps I should start off with mentioning that I am NOT one of those with a thick and bushy beard, so I usually shave every other day. Normally I spend about 5 mins on shaving. At times my skin gets slightly irritated, which might result in light-red patches under my chin. Most of the time it's fine though, and I can get a decent shave. However, not always is the shave that clean. Sometimes certain hairs (esp. on the side - around my jaw and around my whiskers, or under my chin) will be left out, so I'd have to trim them separately with the trimmer.Oh yes, the infamous trimmer. It really is more of an aesthetic feature on the shaver than a tool serving its real purpose. It's just too small and inconvenient. At times I'm having difficulties accessing parts of my face with it, unless I took off the shaving heads.The shaver also comes with a neat LED display that shows how many minutes of shaving time there is remaining. Great. This was one of the features that won me over about this shaver. But what I resent is that it's inaccurate. Well it does accurately show how many minutes you have shaved, but when it comes down to 0 mins, one would expect the battery is about to die, yet usually I can still squeeze several shaves out of it (which means additional 10-15 mins). In the instructions manual it says that after 3 charges it should display the remaining shaving time accurately, but I've already charged it at least 5 times now, and no difference. The highest shaving time is supposedly 65 mins. What is rather curious about all this is that on each charge I've actually been gaining additional minutes to the proposed 65 mins, so the numbers have gotten up to 81 mins on my most recent charge. I would be perfectly happy with getting those additional minutes if that means that the shaver will eventually display the time properly so that if 0 mins is remaining, then 0 it really is. (Perhaps once I've have charged it 10 or more times the display will finally get normal, as suggested in the manual? If it does, I might as well mention it here.)Anyway, speaking of the battery, this is one of the features I am really content with. I can get numerous shaves out of one charge; therefore, there's nothing but praise on this part.I also like the fact that the shaver is easy to wash. You simply open the shaving heads and rinse it.One thing that I as well dislike though, is the On/Off button's silver paint peeling off already after only a couple of weeks' use. But alright, that's already going into details now.Pros:- attractive looks- long battery life- light and not too loud- easy to washCons:- trimmer- doesn't always shave ALL the hairs clean- sort of inaccurate LED display- paint peeling off of the On/Off buttonIf I could, I would give this shaver 3.5 stars. However, for a 4, I guess it will still at least have to get the LED display straight. So if after 10 or so charges it does, then I am giving it a 4. We shall see."

And for the price I paid, just under $9 plus $5 shipping, I could have bought several cans of regular furniture polish. The worst part of my purchase however was that the aerosol can leaked the product from the nozzle either while spraying or just tipping the can over.

48647,0,"I ordered these liners to use inside our Bum Genius cloth diapers once my daughter's poop started becoming consistently more solid. Went with Imse Vimse based on price & good reviews here on Amazon. We have been using them for about 2 months now.Pros:1. Conveniently packaged. They come in a roll and each sheet rips off like toilet paper.2. Do what they say they do- catch the solids while allowing the liquid to go through to the cloth diaper. Then, you simply flush the liner in the toilet and can throw the cloth diaper in the dry pail as usual.3. Good price and since we don't use a liner in every diaper (I have gotten good at guessing when she will have a bowel movement), I think 2 rolls will last a good while.Cons:1. Not at all as soft as I imagined they would be. They have the look and feel of a dryer sheet. I can't imagine it would be too comfy on the tushy. Also, the first few days of use, noticed a redness around my daughter's anus. Might have just been coincidence, but that is when we started putting a liner in only when we thought she was likely to have a bowel movement. Easy to determine after a day or two of charting.2. We don't usually have any issues with our Bum Genius or Rumparooz leaking. But I have had several instances of pee leaking out the leg and getting the edges of her onesies wet while using a liner. I imagine that the urine doesn't absorb as fast as it does when directly on the cloth diaper.Overall, I'm satisfied and may order again but not without asking some cloth diapering mommas what liners they prefer. Might test out another brand to see if I can find something softer."

I figured vanilla milk would just make my cereal taste better, but it doesn't really taste very vanilla like. It definitely has a healthy taste to it, which isn't horrible, but definitely not enjoyable. If you really want to add a little health to your day, I think it's great.

After reading through the list I started to remember that my sex drive has been way lower than normal. Now that the saw palmetto is out of my system my pulse is normal and sex drive is back in overdrive where it was before.Anyway here is a list of side effects pulled from [...]weakness or fainting;black, bloody, or tarry stools;coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds;pain or swelling in your breasts or testicles;chest pain;fast, slow, or uneven heart rate;easy bruising or bleeding; ornausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, itching, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).Less serious side effects may include:nausea, vomiting, stomach pain;diarrhea or constipation;bad breath;headache;dizziness;sleep problems (insomnia);muscle pain;depressed mood; orincreased or decreased interest in sex;"
264478,2,"My wife ordered this item from [...]. We have over a thousand square feet of hardwood floors - and cats. Have you ever tried to chase cat hair with a leaf blower? The first design flaw is the switch mechanism. Inside the handle is a long, plastic rod that moves forward when the switch is turned on. In the ""ON"" position, this long, thin rod presses against an S-shaped metal band mounted on the actual motor switch which is located 16 inches away inside the motor housing. After the first use, the switch stopped working. Considering the cost, attempting to repair was simpler than returning the unit. Once inside, I found that both the thin plastic rod and the ""S"" shaped metal band mounted on the motor switch had about 1mm horizontal play which allowed the rod to slide to the side of the metal band failing to engage the switch. After several switch failures, I bypassed the whole contorted conglomeration and directly wired a 6-amp rocker switch from Radio Shack and mounted it on the underside of the handle. The next problem was the strong exhaust blowing sideways out of the motor housing. This created a swirling storm of whatever kind of hair and fuzz balls I might might be chasing at the time. Vacuuming fast-flying objects out of mid-air is difficult. I redirected the exhaust off of the floor and aimed it directly up the handle by mounting half-cone shaped devices made from flexible Armstrong flooring and duct tape. Chasing cat hair around the floor is now a breeze. The dust bunnies are quickly trapped - and without a chase. Flipping the vacuum head and attaching a dust cloth is useless and a huge waste of time. Every dollar and discount store around sells the light aluminum dusting poles and cloths for pennies. Why push a corded, 7-pound machine around when the same job can be done with something weighing a few ounces and no cord? The final flaw is that the cord is too short. It is okay for a room of less than 144 square feet. On the plus side, the 6-Amp Sanyo motor is powerful - and it does a fantastic job when doing what a light-weight vacuum cleaner was meant to do in the first place. The clear collection bin allows the user to know when the unit needs to be emptied. Empting and cleaning has not been a problem. After remanufacture, a 90-pound weakling can now push this unit around all day - and stay cool in a constant breeze blowing up the handle. We've tried central vacs, Shop Vacs, riding vacs, hoses that would wrap around a football field and small hand vacs on our hardwood floors. This Sanyo is now our favorite. My wife can vacuum all day and still feel like cooking supper at night."
225061,0,I just don't like the texture of these- going back to Lip Smackers. They do have an amazing array of flavors though :) it was worth a try.

105838,1,"This pillow is sufficiently dense not to go flat with repeated use. It provides great support, and the elastic strap makes it easy to affix to my chair at work. I've ordered an extra one so I don't have to carry it back and forth from my car to my office. I've had different lumbar pillows before, and none was as comfortable or supportive as this one."
169588,0,"While this is most likely the best tasting protein powder I've tried (and I've tried many), it isn't all it's cracked up to be. There are just over 1000 calories per serving which is great, and there are 55g of protein which is also great, but a serving is 250 grams. To compare, another powder i had was only 600 calories and 52g protein, but a serving of it was only 150 grams. So if you threw in another 100 grams of that, you'd have 900 calories (almost as much as Muscle Juice) and you'd have about 69g of protein (waayyy more than the muscle juice). So basically this stuff tastes good and has a lot of good stuff in it, but it's partly because they make a serving way more than they should and they don't put in enough protein. It's also a little hard to consume all at once. 250grams of powder combined with 18oz of milk is a lot."
204630,1,"This is an EXCELLENT product. We first learned about this product as a free sample from our doctor. Being from a small area where we don't have the benefits of great stores, I shop on line a lot. And that's where AMAZON comes in. We were very thankful to find that you offered this product. It IS long lasting lubrication just as advertised with no irritating side effects. I have a high sensitivity to lubricants so it has really been great having found this product! Would HIGHLY recommend it. I'd give it a 10 if it was on the scale!"
223425,0,"The product doesn't work immediately when I took it. It takes a while to start feeling it's benefits, but after a few days it starts working, I didn't have any problems when using but the flavor is not the best!! Good purchase though."

364173,0,"This massager is pretty good overall. The variable speeds are great, although you have to work up to the high speed. It can be a bit strong if you start out with it. The massager is heavy, though, so your arm and hands may get tired after a few minutes. A great thing about this is that you can change how far apart the massaging nodules are, depending on how you like it or what area of your body you are massaging. Note: The instructions say that it should not be used for more than 15 minutes at a time. This massager could stand to be a little lighter, but I think it is worth the price."
22510,0,"My wife was very excited to try this one, but over all was disappointed. The rubbery feel and smell are a turn off, as others have noted. You have to use a lot of lube or it snags on the way in. She liked the length and was able to easily use it with both hands or one hand. Excellent for deep penetration but the rubbery texture pulls her pubic hair. Also felt it was just a bit to big around for comfort vaginally, but for anal fun it really does the job. We still use it regularly, but it's not the first toy she reaches for."

169921,0,"The Arnicare arnica cream does relieve pain and soothe with a cooling effect, but I tend to have moderate-severe pain daily, so the relief sometimes only lasted as long as a half hour for me before I needed to reapply. For other people who maybe only have mild-moderate pain or just temporary pain, it can be a great and virtually risk-free option."

318916,2,"I was going to write a review about this product months ago, but didn't get to it. I purchased this twin pack at the end of last April (2010) for $24.55. It didn't occur to me to check the expiration date, but I did, and it was dated to expire a little later that month-in three days! I contacted Zantac and asked them if it was ok to continue taking the product after the expiration date and they advised me that it was better that I didn't. I then contacted the seller (MonsterHotDeals) and he seemed unaware of the issue. He seemed sincere, I guess, and offered to refund my money. Needless to say I lost the address, contacted him again for the address to return the product, no reply. You have to ask yourself why is this seller selling 90 tablets of this product for an inexpensive $25 at 0.21 cents/tablet when compared to Zantac's price point at 50 tablets for $18 at 0.36 cents/tablet? I also discovered another review on here of Zantac themselves pricing their product so cheap because it too was soon to expire. Here's the heading ""Maximum Strength Zantac 150 Acid Reducer, 65-Count Bottle."" Check the expiration date people, especially when the product deals with issues as delicate as matters within the body."
95051,0,ok shaver that seems to do a decent shave.items that could be improved:-using trimmer seems awkard as when it is fully extended it is still very close to the foils; having a trimmer set perpendicular to the main body would have been more useful.-cleaning blades (under foil attachment) is very difficult as the supplied brush is too big to fit in any of the crevices to brush out hair; could be minor as shaver is washable under water
329544,0,"As much as i love the trojan brand, they should never have gotten rid of the round ended condoms.there the original & the best ive used.I'd prefer the round ended condom instead of the nipple or teat end.it feels much more natural than other condoms ive used.That & Lambskin condoms have become my top fave."
158833,0,"I have the 770, but this issue would be common to all of these trimmers. Shaves okay. Problem: eco-unfriendly. Battery contains toxic materials and company does little to assure that people eventually dispose of it properly--Norelco officially tells you somewhere in the literature to take the trimmer to a recycling place, but by the time anyone's ready to replace the thing they won't know where the literature is telling them that, and besides, Norelco doesn't really provide any support for doing so: no address or contact info, even. Since there's little help or encouragement taking care of the battery responsibly, I'm sure most people don't. Thanks Norelco! :( Still, i'm unaware of better alternatives and would be interested to learn of any."
91995,0,"I have put AA duracells in 2 wireless mouses (?) for my computer. They leaked. Corroded the inside of one mouse and I had to replace it. The other I managed to scrape clean. Also happened on two flashlights, one with 2 C size Duracells and one with 2 D size Duracels . If I hadn't checked the batteries the flashlights wold have been corroded and ruined. As it was I had to scrape them clean as the batteries had leaked so badly. I found Rayovacs dont leak. They also don't last as long. ( there is a time lapse test of batteries on you tube). Maxwell batteries work well but I have only tried them in AA size. I'm just reporting these batteries because I have had 4 problems. As my title says I rated them Okay and you would think a battery like Duracell would always be outstanding. My Mom recently passed away and I am not going to be be in much of a holiday spirit, I decided to buy 9 battery operated candles for the windows. I thought she would like that. I went with energizer batteries this time. Never had a problem with them."
346497,0,"This is a very sticky breast binder, you get to have patience to deal with this otherwise it serves it's porpouse, the price though could be lower since it's not a very good material It gets deteriorated right away since is so sticky the velcro sticks A LOT to the fabric."

105883,0,"Muscle Milk Vanilla is slightly less sweet than some protein drinks (including other flavors of Muscle Milk), which I prefer. And the individual containers are a good size. The ones often sold at gyms are larger--too large for a single serving (at least for a small woman) and not big enough for two servings. The biggest problem I have with Muscle Milk in general is that they get clumpy at the bottom. It's important to give these a good shake before drinking, but you still may have some clumps left."
190122,2,I used it once and it seemed okay...2nd time I felt it burn...3rd time I could definitely tell it was because of the Maxiumus lube. I'm very disappointed that I can't use this. This seems to be a very common problem with this lube...I wish I had read the reviews a bit closer.
366893,0,"I looked at all the reviews and decided to give this some time before I wrote this. It seems to work as well as the other pills I bought as far as easing the hip pain. However, the other pills were small capsules, and these things are huge! I take them every day, and daily I cringe at the thought. I take a lot of pills every day and these are the only ones that are simply too big to swallow comfortably. I'd sooner take two or three smaller pills. I tried cutting them in half, but then the jagged edges were even more uncomfortable to swallow.I won't be buying these again for that reason."
408617,2,It doesn't offer any support at all and it really was a waste of money.
348310,0,"I bought these batteries from Amazon and received them in a bubble mailer. The twelve pack of batteries had opened in transit and were scattered in the bubble mailer. Additionally, they have a late 2016 expiration date. I am used to expiration dates in the late teens to even the early twenties at this point. I don't know if 9 volts just don't last as long, but I would have been disappointed if my aim were to use these one or two at a time each year. Instead, I bought these for this year's replacement batteries for the whopping six smoke detectors in my house. I will have depleted them by 2013 so the 2016 date won't be that much of a problem for me. I tend to give batteries four stars, but I give this item three stars instead due to the packaging and date issues."
110555,0,"People were swearing all over workout forums that this was great tasting protein, and I beg to differ. It tastes just as ""bad"" as other bad mixes I've tried (cheap EAS mix comes to mind EAS-Premium Protein Powder, 5lb. bag). It only gets 3 stars for mixing great with a spoon and mixing fine with a shake. I'm still convinced Muscle Milk is the best tasting protein on the market; if only it had purer protein and less calories."
226523,0,"The size limitation is not listed on the Amazon site, but according to the Lumiscope help line this model is limited to arm circumferences 12.5"" or less. That's too small for an adult male with average musculature. I'm no muscle-man but my arm is 13"" around the biceps, and the cuff was not even close to big enough. I had to return mine to Amazon."
354619,0,"I first got these lemon-y bars at my local grocery store and thought them very delicious-as protein bars go, so I decided to order them in bulk from Amazon. Big mistake to order them in south Texas in September. They arrived with the coating completely melted, and tasted horrible. I just threw away $50 worth of protein bars because they were inedible."
138813,0,"So for my upper lip and certain other areas, this product worked pretty well and didn't really irritate my skin. For the dense, curly hair around the chin, under the chin and more complicated curvy ares, not so much. It is messy, as others have said, but it cleans up with warm water which is nice. I am torn about the product because it works well in some areas and almost not at all in others. I don't think this will be a wax replacement for most, but those with fine hairs that grow a little long, maybe so."
13034,0,"The collar is easy to use, I found it to be a little to long and overlapping, but I am small I guess. It's comfortable and easy to put on. I wish the coldness would last longer, but it's a good option to have when needed. I have 3 ice packs I use in rotation after brain/spinal surgery and this is one of them. I would recommend it from my research on other options online."
278365,0,"Alright, so like the title says...... but yeah, besides that, I'm not quite sure what it is these guys are doing for me, hence the 3-star rating. They also smell pretty crappy (but i've been told that's a common problem with all vitamins) & can give you acid reflex."
265759,0,"I have the older BLUE Strips that some say are more sensitive. If they are, I'd hate to see the newer pink ones. I first tested the morning after my missed period and got a negative (1st test). Tested the following morning and got a negative (2nd test) BUT I could see a faint, faint place where the positive line would/should be. Tested the morning after that and could see under the top layer where the positive line ""might"" be appearing, but to me it still looked negative (3rd test). Tested the following morning (4th test) and again saw a very, very faint place where the positive line ""almost"" showed up (turned ever so lightly pink - but STILL did NOT look like a positive to me). THAT day (4th day after missed period) I went to the store and bought a First Response Early Test and mid-day it IMMEDIATELY turned DARK PINK. These tests are good if you are wondering if you should buy a better more expensive test, but not much else. I am confident that if I had tested with a First Response Early Test the day I missed my period, it would have been positive (just like it was with my 1st pregnancy).My advice when reading the test is - if you see anything resembling a second pink line - go buy a First Response Early Test and see if you are pregnant."
200479,0,"I purchased the peppermint oil as a safe option to rid the house of mice. I've applied the oil pretty regularly around the attic and storage areas where mice might lurk and the activity hasn't seemed to reduce much, if at all. It's only been a few weeks and I'm going to keep trying but I may have to break down and buy poison if it doesn't work soon. On the plus side, this seems to be a good value for the money and the smell is very pleasant (even if it's not very long-lived)."
120771,0,it is true! You definitely smell like furniture polish (pledge) when you frist put this one...however within a few minutes the big time smell wears off and then the scent of lime stays with you for quite a while. This is a cheap after shave. I don't think it contains any alcohol as it doesn't burn when you put it on after you have shaved.

I can't say that my mood was ""more elevated"" than without this drug. I noticed one day that I would smile super often, however, I had a really good reason to be happy to begin with! I'm certain I would normally have smiled all day in that situation. I cant say definitively that I think this works, which means that you might not want to expect too much when you take this. Then again, how many people get duped by placebos?"
381561,0,"these pads are advertised as absorbent, discreet and contoured...however i can only agree with the absorbent aspect. thankfully my wife is a stay at home mom-only the baby sees her with these things! if i didn't know better i would think breast feeding has disfigured her breasts :-(. i think due to the fact that they are thicker they don't fit to form so you see the entire (flat) outline through clothes. also, the adhesive strip that is meant to keep it in place...there is a single strip measuring about 15*30mm...hardly enough to do justice-esp when you have to move n replace 'em to allow for feeding.all in all-though we kept them-for the extra leaky days- i definitely wont buy another set."

274307,0,"This grabber definitely had pros and cons. The pros are that the aluminum shaft (yes, it's aluminum, not plastic) seems sturdy, and the tips grip pretty well. The cons are the handle, weight, and length. I find the handle to be awkward to use; it just isn't a natural way to grip. I am disabled, and don't have a lot of strength in my arms/hands, and find that it's a bit too heavy. It's also a little too long if you are using it to pick something up and put it in your other hand.Update: I got the Ettore 49036 Grip 'n Grab, and it's just what I was looking for. Sturdy, lightweight, right length, picks up good, and the kind of handle I find comfortable and easy to use (trigger type). I would definitely recommend it over the Unger."
391823,0,i had to assemble the parts and almost ripped the tubing while trying to it. the gauge meter is not as easy to read as it is with an Omron.

So most of the lower part of the shower, which is the dirtiest, does not get any of the spray even on it. I even tried do the spray two times in a row, and there is still not enough spray to run to the bottom of the shower. I should have read everyone else's reviews before buying this! I do hope they can make one sometime that works, it sure would make life easy!"

34377,0,"In the past I've found that adding MSM to my daily supplements greatly decreased arthritis discomfort, but then couldn't find the brand I liked anymore. I was eager to try this brand because each tablet has a high dose. I took one tab a day for a week, but then noticed I was very bloated as though I'd eaten too much salty food. I also didn't notice any decrease in pain which I had almost immediately before. This was a very short trial and not very scientific, but I decided to quit the product until the swelling subsided. It could possibly have been caused by something else.I plan to try the product again in a more controlled situation while I also keep my sodium intake from other sources low. I'll update if I get different results. It is worth saying though that the other brand seemed to make a difference in how I felt within a day or two and this one didn't. It may be metabolized differently and one needs a longer period to notice any change. Since I know MSM does help how my knees feel from my past experience, it seems worth a trial to see if it helps you."
81248,0,"I had tried the cashew nut Larabar and loved it. Then tried some of the fruit ones. Some were great. I didn't love the cherry as much. I tried this one because I love ginger.

45611,0,"I have shaved for over 40 years. During this time I have used many electric shavers including remmington, norelco, and now Braun. I really liked my remmington, which died afted 5 years. I have had three norelcos, all of which worked well. Having never tried a braun I purchased a braun travel #370 on sale at a local store for $10.00. I was quite surprised. It provided the closest shave I have ever had other than a atra blade, but with out the irratated skin. The down side was that it isn't rechargeable. I then purchased a reconditioned 7526 for $39.00. It arrived well package. It looked brand new except for a small sticker stateing it was reconditioned. I have now used tis razor for 6 months with no problems. I some times shaver twice a day and the top of my head. The pop up trimmer is far superior to the norelco and in my case a much the razor provides closer shave equaling my old blades. At $39.00 it has already paid for itself. I have considered ordering the self cleaning base (on line for $40.00) but think that it is not needed. I wash the 7526 under hot water once aweek and it needs chargeing for about one hour every 2.5 weeks. The 7526 in my opinon is a excellent value at $39.00. I peronally would find it hard to pay the regular price for this or any other electric shaver. All in all I have to say that I am more than satisfied with the 7526."

In one week, this same item # is now being sold by another company so I cannot verify whether I simply didn't view the picture well enough etc. My seller was seneca river trading and now it is another company for the same item # so who knows. The picture (small one that needs to be enlarged) today does show the 30B model but the description does not mention it. And the price is less today."
182030,0,"This is a very nice, sturdy thermometer with a handy feature of the magnifying case, which makes it easy to ready the temperature. HOWEVER, it is very hard to shake the ""mercury"" (the fake mercury) down! I have used regular mercury thermometers in the past and have never had this problem. This is a particular problem when you are charting and taking your temperature every day. Maybe there is some trick I don't know about, but i doubt that shaking a thermometer down is rocket science! I'd appreciate any tips!"
416482,0,"I was afraid to buy this heating pad after reading the negative reviews, but I couldn't find a better option. I was very happy with my purchase for about 18 months. However, after storing the heating pad for a couple of months during the summer, it started having the automatic shutoff problems other reviewers have described when I took it out of storage. Now I have to replace it. The good things about it, while it worked, were that the lowest heat setting is comfortably warm and the highest setting gets nice and hot. I used this item almost every day, so I did get a lot of use out of it. I love that the fabric cover is part of the heating pad--not removable--so it doesn't shift around. The heating pad is very flexible and comfortable and the cord is plenty long. The button for adjusting the heat makes a very loud clicking sound which I found annoying, but it is not a deal breaker. Another problem is that the place where the cord exits the heating pad seemed to often be in the way/uncomfortable when laying on the heating pad with it under my back (also not a deal breaker). Despite the problems, Sunbeam appears to have a near monopoly on the heating pad market, so my replacement pad is going to be a Sunbeam as well. Other brands have poor reviews, too."
64591,2,Ton's of bells and whistles but the comfit sleeveis anything but comfortable -- it lacks velcro -- you cannot get an accurate reading unless you have huge arms and are extremely fat in the forearm -- this is a BAD design for a sophisticated machine... plus because the sleeve is so messed up there's no way of knowing if the reading's you are getting are accurate -- BAD BAD sleeve design!

It is soft and fits our contour pad well, it just wasn't quite what I was wanting out of a cotton terry cover."

They don't stay cold quite as long as the old ones did but still keep food cold in our small cooler. They are a bit more flexible than the old ones, so I use them for icing my knees or back. I'd buy them again. They were about the same price as the old ones so I'd buy from the seller again."
39753,2,"I purchased the Bed Desk for use with my laptop. The first thing I noticed was that it was to high to use in bed. The second thing was that when you put the top of the desk at an angle, there is a wood stop that keeps the laptop from sliding forward. That lip is to high and it digs into your wrists and also the screws on the hinge were sticking out and gave my 2 year old laptop it's first scratches! It may work out ok as a serving tray or magazine/book rack for use in your bed but thats about it. Even as a lap tray when your sitting in a chair, the all wood underneath is hard on your legs. Not the best designed thing and am returning it."
44489,0,This is an ok product... I would reccommend it above chemical dyes. I wanted to lighten my red hair... it ade it darker. The best product to use to lighten your hair is... Hydrogen Peroxide.. It works great. and it's cheap!Overall rating on this product is fair.. and worth a try if you want a few dark red highlights!
82654,2,This powder doesn't smell like much and certainly not Aqua di Parma. I wouldn't spend your hard earned money on it. I love A di P and was willing to pay extra for the talc but this is a HUGE disappointment. I think it's a fake and I recommend not buying it.
345714,0,"Overall these run very small, while they do the job, they are extremely uncomfortable to wear due to the fabric used. They should be lined with a cotton material which would make them feel much more tolerable on the skin. Attaching the elastic bands behind you alone with the Velcro is impossible and you need someone to help the first time.....then leave it attached for it's next use. Access for urination is very difficult and really needs a redesign. You really work up a sweat getting it on and don't drink to much liquid if you're planning on going out and have to use public restrooms. It's obvious that whoever designed it has never wore it. It is overpriced and there must be something else more comfortable that will do the job. Look around before purchasing this item."

421073,0,"This is a quality product that provides exactly what the description says. I found the taste acceptable and the price is indeed exceptional. My only real disappointment with the product was with the mixing. It does not stir well so you really need to shake with water. However, you need to do this just a SMALL amount of water first and then once the powder has mixed in then you can carefully add more water along the side of the container so that you avoid the excessive amounts of foam that form if you just shake with the desired amount of water.I am currently trying several brands. If I don't find another that I like as well then I would definately buy this again."
352721,0,"This is soap. What can you say. As soap, it makes leather, cleans, and allows you to shave. Basically it is very similar to Ivory abut it does seem to shave a bit better than the Burma Shave mug soap I found at Albertson's Food Store. Soap is soap, though."

If you eat, your crown will come out. I suppose if you have nothing better - go for it, but be prepared to re-install your crown every time you eat. The first time I bought it, I just figured it was old and dried out, but the second wasn't much better. I would try a different brand before I would go back to this one."

340496,0,"I can't properly put into words what it is like to wake up in the morning, smell my breath and have it smell neutral. No foul odor!!! Honestly, I am still at the point where I feel I am either still asleep and dreaming or I have died and gone to Heaven. It's impossible! How can this be true and yet, it is true! No more bad breath. No more body odor. Well, to be fully honest I have to say that it EVENTUALLY levels off to about 95% elimination of body odor BUT THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!!! The problem with this liquid product is that eventually I find the taste to be obnoxious, I always have to wash off the bottle or it leaves a green ring in my refrigerator and, worst of all, I suspect it is leaving a subtle green tint on my teeth. So, I have ordered the soft gel capsules to start where this liquid left off. They expire in 2014 and the world is supposed to end December 21, 2012 so I am extremely happy and confident that when the world finally ends...I BE SMELLIN GREAT!!! HA!!!"

132587,0,"The overall appearance is a big improvement over previous waterpiks. The water tank is more secure. The handle is well designed. The controls are easy to use. Unfortunately, the most important feature of all is the water pressure, which is terrible. You can get a stronger water jet from the waterpik hand held unit. Why bother to have a pressure control if the top pressure isn't very strong to start with? Why under-power the most expensive model you sell?"
215684,0,"I've used heating pads for several years (always bought at a local dept store), and they were okay. Recently, though, they've had a very short life span of less than a year. So I decided to do some research on Amazon, and after reading the reviews, I decided to go with this one in a 14"" by 27"" size. When this pad arrived, I was surprised at how large it was (so really check the measurement size before you buy as this one would cover my whole back from shoulders to hips with heating pad left over!). The pad works as described with detailed instructions on using the item. But I've decided to return it for two reasons. First, it's a very bulky, ropey feeling heating pad. All heating pads come with instructions not to lay on them, but we do when we put them on our backs while sitting in chair. You can't do that comfortably with this one because of the wire coils protruding with this one. Very uncomfortable unless you just lay it across yourself. Second, its a very heavy heating pad. If you've used the ones from local stores (usually a Sunbeam brand), you know how lightweight those are. This heating pad weighs four lbs, but it feels much heavier. Its very cumbersome and unwieldy to use. Those are the reasons I'm returning it. I wanted to share this for the older customers so that you would realize the negatives of this item. As I mentioned previously, you are able to set the temperature as needed, but in my opinion, that feature is overridden by the fact that its so heavy and can only be laid across you (which means if you have a back injury, you have to lay face down and try to get it in position on your back or have someone else help you position it)."

Also I had no cravings for food but made myself eat at dinner since I had missed Brkfst and Lunch without a notice. The gum is flavorful and lasting, soft and moist. I am a real person with many reviews. I recommend this gum but would like to pay less for it just because. I am chewing some right now! Smile."

I only took it for about fourish maybe just about five months but had to stop due to severe cramping and cyst pains to the point I could not ignore them. Still never got my period. Maybe the brand, maybe it was not long enough. I had read sme women get cysts from itso it was worth a shot. No other complaints about it, yeah it tastes bad but all medicines taste bad. I did liquid because I cant swallow pills and if you just wash t down real quick its not that big of a dea. bad taste for maybe two seconds. good luck to others I was bummed this did not work out for me."

I say go for it if you're an expert pill swallow-er, but if you don't like big pills pass these by and look for something else.Note: Some people have been saying that these vitamins make them nauseous. This only happened to me once and its when I took it without a belly full of food like you're supposed to. I just took it with an orange and thought it would be enough. It wasn't.

244331,2,"The ""thumper"" doesn't thump; there is no pressure on deep tissues as claimed. I expected this device to push down into my deep tissues by exerting some type of force because that is what is implied. The only way to get into the deep tissue is to have someone press down on the vibrator or prop yourself up on top of it so that your weight causes pressure.All the ""thumper"" does is vibrate. It makes you itch pretty quickly, but happily you can control the intensity of the vibration.If this was advertised as a vibrator, I'd say it's the best out there. That's the only reason why I gave it a 2.If you're looking for a deep tissue massage that has a slight pounding sensation or an exertion of force as the word ""thump"" implies, you will be totally let down.I'd say this is pretty much false advertising."

343476,0,"Look at the photo carefully. See the tub up on top where the water goes? It's not attached permanently. It just kind of wobbles up there with a small gasket around the hole in the bottom where the water is fed into the motor. In other words, if you were to remove or bump the tub while it has water in it, it will spill over everything. Also, you can't leave any water in it and place the mouth piece in its holder or set it on your counter for a moment, as it begins to slowly drain water if it's not held higher than the level of the water--a syphoning effect occours.The tube that extends from the unit to the mouthpiece is cheap and way too short (hardly 3 feet) and it's so strongly coiled it ends up hardly being able to reach 2 feet.The motor is very loud and sounds like an old rusty boat motor and shakes itself around my counter. (I learned setting it on a towell helps to immobilize it, and quiet it a bit, which is good because I'll also have a towell ready in case I bump into the tub.)Why then do I use it? Well, because it actually works! Once I mastered the art of using this half-baked contraption, I found my mouth, teeth, and gums are cleaner than ever. The stream of water it puts out is very powerfull and ""Piks"" up where brushing and flossing leave off. I'd gladly buy a better brand if one existed, but to my knowledge, WaterPik are the only ones making such a machine. I think that explains why WaterPik has cut so many corners making this thing--no competition! No one else wants to make them."

It did get me paying attention to my smoking and I have realized that it has a lot to do with my behavior. Behavior that has developed over time and I suppose that it will take time to stop by breaking my behavioral habits one at a time. Here are a few examples. Smoke when I wake up, have coffee, after a meal, when I get in the car, when I take a break, while waiting, in the john etc. etc. etc.With that said:1) The product does what it claims and does capture Tar.2) Doesn't affect taste.3) None that I got were defective."

(The last Braun I owned had one that projected a full inch, near the top, allowing you to direct the cut and still see what hairs you're cutting)On the plus side, it is extremely rugged (so it's unlikely to break anytime soon, I'm afraid), well shaped for use, and recharges superbly. The so-called cutter is useless, but the main foil section works beautifully, so if you don't need a quality beard trimmer (as I do) then it's a good value. And it's at a pretty good price..."

It is not as close, *even with dull blades on my current rotary*, takes a long time to mow down any left over longer hairs-- having to go over and over to catch them just right.Next purchase, I'm back to a rotary. I believe the Norelco/Philips is the best brand. Remington rotary batteries have had a much shorter charge life."

He practically carries a bottle with the Whey protein shake everywhere he goes and when he is not at the gym, he has a dumbbell in his hand and is always pumping it. I have no idea why he is so scrawny, but I think it goes to show you that even this Whey protein isn't going to work miracles.Most of the reviews deal with whether or not this whey protein TASTES good.

Breathe Right strips certainly have a niche but I found theSnorepin(TM) - The Smarter Solution Against Snoring and Sleep Apnea (Advanced Design Save Your Lungs)to work just as effectively and it's FAR less visible not to mention reusable. TheSnorepin(TM) - The Smarter Solution Against Snoring and Sleep Apnea (Advanced Design Save Your Lungs)is not quite as comfortable as the Breathe Right strips but I quickly got used to it.

245263,1,"My first Braun lasted over twenty years. I have to admit that, towards the end, I kept hoping it would break down so that I could buy then new 7570. I finally gave up and shifted it to my office as an emergency backup.My beard is completely self willed. In some placed it's thin, and in others, heavy. It grows up, down, east and west with abandon, but little logic. I generally think of it as an alien monster that lives on my face. The 7570 is the first razor that has completely conquered the creature. It just quietly hums along, turning facial hair into dust without ever a burn or a pinch.It includes the ultimate toy for the lazy man, a storage stand that cleans and charges the razor. And the first LCD panel on a razor. This not only tells you charge level and reminds you about maintenance, it provides part numbers for the head. No doubt the next model will include an interface to your Palm V that will record blood pressure and heart rate. If anyone could do it, it would be Braun.Seriously, the 7570 is a superb piece if precision machinery that does exactly what it was designed to perfectly. There's no doubt that it is a bit pricey, but this kind of quality will last for decades. It charges faster than your digital phone and works on a wide range of voltages. Of course, the real thrill is pretending you'rew the incredibly macho guy in the Braun commercial.On the down side, the cleaning fluid cartidges are hard to find, so order a small pile ahead. They last 4 to 5 months each. I haven't tried it yet, but, with a bit of ingenuity it might be possible to refill them."

183435,0,"This is a great overall product. I got it as a gift and I used it mostly to give myself a stubble shave and sometimes fix my barber's mistakes. :)After using it for 2yrs, the charge starting to hold less and less, from 15mins, to 12 and after not using it for 4 months (leaving it off the charger, but not fully charged before doing so) it never held a charge beyond 3-4mins now and running slow.I did a ""Mac Guyver"" on the battery replacement I had (I was fortunate I had the same battery type in an old closet set to throw stuff out). I then reassembled everything and left it charging for 5 minutes to test. It worked immediately and was running better now than it had when I was charging the dying batteries recently. Now, it works like new.If you plan to change the batteries yourself, order the actual batteries. Don't experiment with other types of batteries, I was lucky I had the exact same rating and types of batteries to replace it with. :)From this point forward, do the following:-Disconnect the charger from the wall, if you have a full charge and not planning to use it for more than 3 days at a time-If its your first time using it, let it charge the 10-16hrs it requires first. This sets the batteries memory as to what a full charge should be.-Don't wash with water directly, clean with a damp cloth, or remove the blades alone and wash those under running water only. The handle (where you hold the body of the trimmer) is not waterproof.3 stars, because I didn't follow these rules, nor were they stated on the instructional care manual it came with.Even now, blades look like new and shiny after 2yrs of use. :)"

I would assume that with any warmer this would be true. But even so, it is better than than using them out of the old plastic box where they were actually cold.I mean, if anyone has a doubt about that last opinion, they should try getting up on a cold January evening, using the bathroom and using a cold wipe for themselves and they may be wishing for the warmer one, even if it is only room temp!I would recommend this to anyone looking for a warmer."

Garden of Life, the manufacturing company, was founded by Jordan Rubin who himself was stricken with Crohn's colitis, had cured himself taking an original form of this product among others. Read his book, ""The Maker's Diet,"" and place yourself on the path to health and wellness. I take 6 Primal Defense caplets daily for my struggle against arthritis. It has improved my immune function as well as my four big dogs.In 2003 my eight yr. old Rottweiler was sick with an open infection in his paw. His immune system was done as it refused to respond to copious amounts of an antibiotic with prednisone. After 6-8 weeks he lay exhausted on the floor that left me thinking he may not pull out of it. I then decided to give him four Primal Defense caplets with his meds. In two days, I was shocked as he got up and slowly walked to the front door. He was getting well. Eleven days later he was off all meds and his wound healed completely. Seeing a revival like this was unbelievable experience that I argued was a valid testimony to the efficacy of this probiotic. It fell on deaf ears with his veterinarian. My dogs now see a holistic vet who advocates natural or raw foods for dogs and a probiotic. My own diet reflects a natural approach with green foods (See review of ""Perfect Food"") and natural oils and Primal Defense. I feel better than I have in a long time and my arthritis is waning. Thanks Jordan.Amazon offers the best price I can find anywhere at $32, free shipping and two day delivery. At 6 caps/day, I go through the 180 every month so I save a lot.

I took one about an hour ago. In the first five or ten minutes my body felt really relaxed, but I was still tense, my shoulders were still raised and the ""edge"" didn't go away. I saw a spider on the ground about thirty minutes later and was in a panic for another thirty minutes just like I would normally get, so that made me wonder. I was really hoping I wouldn't be freaked out!I took another one about twenty minutes ago because I didn't feel as great as the other reviewers did. And the dosage says two per day so...Mostly my body feels like its trryyyiingg to relax, but the edge is still there. It feels like when you're right about to get back to a sober point after drinking or smoking.I'm assuming that it will get better, because a lot of you experience similar issues as me, and claim that it worked out for you, so I am trusting in an improvement.If anything, the purpose of this review is to talk about how it initially felt, since I was wondering how it would feel in the first few hours before I bought it...We will see!"

38000,0,"Here's my disclaimer: I am NOT a physician, physiologist, or EMT. Nor have I ever even used this particular device.Here is what I AM: Someone who has witnessed a similar device save the life of a dear friend and colleague.I know that this type of device can save lives in some situations because I saw it happen! Some folks have posted reviews which cite some grim survival rates. However, these statistics appear to be based upon some very broad ranges of incidents - ie. they don't break down the survival rate by HOW SOON the defibrillator was applied to the victim. I have been told that the survival rate is highly dependent on how quickly the heartbeat is restored. I.e. if the heartbeat is in V-Fib for only two or three minutes, the survival rate is much higher than the cited grim statistics.In our case, we were attending an event at a hotel in Laughlin, Nevada when a friend dropped down like an anchor in the middle of a sentence from a Ventricular Fibrillation. One of our other friends was a CPR instructor and he immediately recongnized the need for CPR and began administering it. The hotel security was called and told of the dire emergency and they very quickly responded by sending one of their security personnel with an automatic defibrillator. He ripped the shirt off our friend's chest and placed the electrodes in the positions indicated. The device he used was talking him through everything. It told us to stand back while it tested the heart rhythm and then quickly advised us to not touch the victim because a shock would be administered. After the shock happened, it re-analyzed the heart rhythm and advised us that the heartbeat had been restored. Many minutes later the local EMT's arrived with their even more sophisticated equipment. Our friend was quickly taken off to the hospital.There is NO doubt that the prompt use of the automatic defibrillator saved his life. He was elderly and had preexisting heart problems and he still does - FOUR YEARS LATER. We love every christmas card we get!Well, no one can guarantee any particular outcome, but, if time is precious (and it IS when someone is in V-Fib), having an automatic defibrillator close at hand can literally be a life-saver.I agree with the others that a person should also improve their odds with reasonable training on these issues, as well.To hell with the callous critics.PS Laughlin, Nevada was a test bed for the use of automatic defibrillators. It was nothing but luck on our part to be in a hotel where they had one. We credit good planning by the hotel folks and the automated defibrillator with saving a life.PPS. How do you thing the security guard felt after he fully realized that he had saved a life??"
112274,1,"This was a very good diet bar, however, the taste was a little bland. I used it for breakfast and was very pleased with how well it satisfied my hunger. I didn't get as hungry for lunch when I usually do. (Previously, I would normally eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast.) The taste could use some improving upon. The nuts did create a better taste. I've used Slim Fast before and this seemed to satisfy better than the Slim Fast products. I'd recommend this to anyone trying to lose weight or to someone who doesn't have time for breakfast and/or lunch. This makes a great meal substitute and is quick and easy."

251533,0,"I don't normally write reviews for goods but since I like to read them be4 I shop, I figure out I should write this one for Alli weigh-loss pills so others could share my points. Alli works okay for me. There was a period of time I've been using it continually for about two monthes and I lost around 5 pounds (first I got to admit I was not ""over-weight"" defines by the product but I really want to loss some of my body weight). Shame on me because I was too lazy to do exercises daily (even when I did it, it last no more than 5 minutes per day...). However, due to the side effect, I really paid attention on what I ate for my meals. I almost avoid all kinds of snacks and controlled the fat under 15g for a single meal. And so I did it, even though I wasn't quite satisify with the 5 prouds I lost. It also made me felt healthier and better, psychologically. However, I couldn't lost more than 5 prouds no matter how I tried. I was quite upset about that and quite using this med after two monthes. Without the med (the nasty side effect) I started to return to my old eating habbits and thus my weight regain to the original scale later. However, I thought if I could continually using the dieting pattern and do some exercise daily I could lost more. I am planning to give it another try soon.The side effect could be very nasty sometimes, but only happend a day or two after I ate very high fat meals. After I took the pills more than a week, the side effect would happen as soon as I ate very oily food. If unprepared, it would really embarrassing you. These including fart with oil and making great sounds when I was using bath room. The oil thing really is a disadvantage; fortunately, if I kept my diet or even regular meals (am a Chinese) none of these would happen. However, on some occasions you really got to EAT!! I went on to a cruise trip when I was taking the med and I knew I wasn't able to resist the food, but I didn't want to ruin my trip (and my life) with the side effects so I came up with this solution--I was using nightime long maxi-pads even though I wasn't having period(excuse me on this please if you don't feel well, but this is a girl thing only...) and even though I could felt the side effect, it wouldn't bother me at all. Hope this trick is useful for y'all ladies.Prehaps it was the diet that made me lost weight, but without Alli (or the side effect of it) I couldn't really make it in the first place."

361468,0,"Let me start by saying I love ElastoGel products & have used some of them for many years. (Yes, they last many years!) They are comfortable and the coverage is excellent. The cervical collar and the huge back one are covered in a deep blue non-slippery fabric that is long lasting and works very well as a cover to the flexible, dense gel within. But this long wrap and some of the other products are covered with this light blue, slippery nylon-type fabric that is miserable. First, the velcro catches on it and raises the nap badly. Second, the gel inside slips around in the covering, which is a major problem in a wrap as long as this one.I tried removing the outer blue cover but the gel inside is also covered in the same slippery nylon fabric (ah, no wonder it slips so much: nylon against nylon. Any novice seamstress could tell you that's not such a great idea.) I called the company to find out if I could purchase a dark blue heavier cover like the covering on some of their other wraps. The answer is no, there are no alternatives. Moreover, I was told this slippery cover is indeed a terrific heat-conveying fabric. Well, maybe if enough customers complain they will change the material. There is simply no reason for this situation since they already work with another, better fabric.So if you are choosing between one of their darker blue items and one of the lighter ones, if the darker size will do, go with that. Only choose this light blue material if no other size will work for you."

Wow, clean hair and scalp, removes buildup of prolong shampoo residue buildup. Also helped regrow hair lost from thyroid damage where I lost hair in the front (was a small patch but noticeable).

So I gave it a shot.The first night I took 4 capsules and did drink plenty of water with lemon juice throughout the whole day. The next day I only had 1 bowel movement. On day 2 I upped my dosage to 6 capsules and the next day had 2 bowel movements. On day 3 I upped it to 7 capsules and 2-2 1/2 bowel movements. Then I upped it to 8 and the next day had 4 bowel movements and I continued this pace for 7 days. On day 8 (1st day off cleanse) I noticed my side was hurting a lot and I was in intense pain and had to go to the doctor because I started bleeding. I have never had pain like this before and was very concerned. On day 9 I took 6 capsuled of Oxy Powder as maintenance and I notice on day 10 my pain intensified. So I am unsure if this is related to the Oxy Powder however I have never experienced this before.Since this happened I have discontinued using Oxy Powder but I am left with a dull ache on the entire left side of my stomach that and intermittent sharp pains that I never had before. So now I have to go see a gastrologist and have a colonscopy and endoscopy $750.00 :( I am hoping I did not suffer intestinal damage because of this product. I did return the product and I was promised a refund. The representative at Global Healing was really nice!I want to also say I did drink plenty of water while I was taking Oxy Powder and do drink a lot of water on a daily basis. So I am unsure if I have done more harm than good with this product.I would recommend anyone considering this product to check with their physician first to make sure it is safe for your body. I give this product 3 stars because even though it did not work for me the representatives at Global Healing were extremely professional and nice!****P.S.***** I am currently taking extra virgin coconut oil and benefiber with decaffeinated tea to help with constipation issues and so far it is working I am having between 2-3 bowel movements a day!"

I do not use it as directed, rather, when my sinuses are clogged and causing me pain, I squirt one squirt in each nostril and then repeat every 20 minutes for one hour (three separate applications) and it works every time! My aunt, who suffers from sinus infections, just tried it (my way) and claims that it will even work during a full infection."

8506,0,"with water, soap and bits of food. We use it for glasses, the blender, other deep items - does an OK job, and it's the only tool we have right now to clean such things.But as soon as you pull the brush out of whatever you're washing, even a little bit, the bristles spray water, suds and food in all directions. It sprays my clothes, clean dishes in the dish drainer, the countertops, even the cabinet doors. That's at normal washing speed - I mean, you're trying to get the job done in a reasonable amount of time, right? So you're kind of moving right along, and spatterspatterspatter. It doesn't help to slow down - it still gets you. At the moment I have a few dozen spatter marks on my shirt, which means there are even more deposited in an arc around the sink.I've never had a bottle brush do this kind of thing, not so easily. OXO, this ain't rocket science! OXO's made me a pizza wheel that fell apart, another pizza wheel that collects water in the handle while in the dishwasher, so when you take it out you have to pull the handle off and put it and the blade to dry in the dish-drainer. OXO made me another scrub brush - the kind where you put soap in the handle and push on the rubber top to make the soap come out, but the entire brush tends to fall off quite easily. Again, not rocket science. I think maybe OXO ""engineers"" don't actually try to use the tools they design."
83213,0,It's too soon to speak to whether or not this product is doing me any good_ but i can warn you that it smells bad and tastes worse. it's on the large size as well_ it's about as long as 2 aspirin tablets in length and almost as thick as 2 aspirin tablets stacked and a little bit wider than an aspirin. if you're delicate/sensitive to scent and taste you might want to stay away from this brand- i also ordered their 'Rejuvenage 40+' multivitamin and it also smells bad and taste worse- so i'm guessing everything this brand makes will smell bad and taste worse- and if it doesn't say 'mini' or 'small' in regards to size- it's probably gonna be a large pill to swallow. their 'rejuvenage' was even bigger than this pill- this pill would have fit inside the 'rejuvenage' pill.

After each shave I had to clean up areas, mostly around my chin and neck, with my old Norelco which I was hoping to replace. Finally after about 3 weeks I returned it to Amazon for a full refund which went very smoothly and with no long hairs or hard feelings. I think now I will just replace my old Norelco with a new Norelco, as it definitely does a better overall job."

295359,0,"OK, what we're dealing with a strip of neoprene, which can velcro to itself to make a loop around your arm. At one end of the strip is a thick pad, which you're supposed to place over the muscle or tendon (or whatever) that hurts.So far so good. But, in order to keep the neoprene strip from sliding off your arm, they've sewn a second, longer band of velcro to it, with a plastic buckle you can use to tighten the velcro strap around the brace itself. With me so far?Here's the mistake in engineering: The buckle is not directly on top of the pad. The buckle is next to the pad. So you put it on your arm, and make it nice and tight, and you can feel the plastic buckle right through the neoprene sleeve. The pad feels nice on the sore tendon, but the buckle does not. The relief I'm getting from the pressure pad is undermined by the pain I'm getting from the stupid plastic buckle.I may take a pair of scissors to this thing and chop off the secondary velcro band and buckle entirely. It won't stay on my arm as well, but it might just feel better."

I've had great Amazon customer service but I still can't figure out how to get it fixed. I don't know if it's UPC confusion or just the confusing title of Copper/Iron Free; I notice this item is a big seller in the Copper category but it shouldn't even be in the Copper category, that's bad classification just by noting the word in the title an ignoring ""free""Crown Organic Exchange and 5 Stars Natural sent the version with Copper which is not this UPC or Title. NetRush sent the correct one."
51410,0,"I used to have the old one that hurt like crazy (and i'm good with pain) and I got this one for my legs and underarms so I wouldnt have to shave anymore. So it does a pretty good job- like you can's see any hair but it still doesn't feel smooth like after you shave. Hardly painful on legs but hurts pretty bad when doing underarm. I would still recommend it though since even though skin may not feel all smooth, you still don't have to shave for about 3 weeks :) and it works pretty fast too :)"

It took me a few sessions and many hours to finally be hair free, and the hair came back in less time than if I had depilated. If you are a female and you don't want to use this on a large area it would probably work, but guys with coarse hair, stay away from this. I have been using epilation and it is much quicker and easier. I am going to try IPL next, but nothing seems to be perfect yet."
289600,0,I just got done shaving with the Musgo Real shave creme!.It is a very good product but I think compared to Proraso it's a bit overrated.Musgo does a pretty good job but I had to make 3 passes with a new and sharp razor to get a good shave whereas with the same razor and a new blade I can do it with only 2 passes with Proraso tho its kinda a flip side as Musgo Real is easier and quicker to apply to your face than Proraso but the quality or rather the 'closeness' of the shave isn't quite as good but again I like the relative ease that Musgo Real lets you lather up with and personally tho I know some dont care for it I think the scent of Musgo Real is superior to Proraso....Still with the same blade and razor combo and I used a Weishi Razor and a Personna blade I got a 'relatively easy' and quick shave.Granted it wasn't Barber Shop quality but its better than a Trac razor would do so i rated the Musgo Real shave creme 3 stars as while its NOT exceptional I do feel its very good for what it does and its hard to get a good and quick shave with a Safety Razor so I think over all it did very well....'Now For Those Who Keep Score':WORST SHAVE 'Was with a Weishi Razor and a Dorco blade with Aveeno Shave Creme...BEST SHAVE 'Was with a Weishi Razor and a Personna Blade with Proraso Shave Creme.BEST SHAVE TIPS: Its true what everybody says that you have to have a good quality blade and a shave creme or soap that lathers up your face real good but:But you also need 3 other things which are:1. Time which means give yourself the time to do the job right.2. Hot water and lots of it to make the whole thing easier.3. A firm but light hand on the razor helps plenty.BEST SHOPPING TIPS:Always shop Amazon as you'll be surprised at what you can get and at good prices too especially if you live in a smaller town and i do.So don't overlook the bargain buys and a pack of the sample blades are a good way to save money on blades.Now the Shaving Soap is what works best for you tho I've found that with a good sharp blade and a can of Barbasol with lots of hot water you can get a passable shave if your short on cash and most of us are nowadays.So remember to watch for sales on Amazon and lather up you'll enjoy it...Nuff Said.Indiana Ed.

188814,0,The thing works great as a back scratcher! But if you want to use the three rolling massage wheels on the other end you may be rolling the dice. The one we got had the holes for the axle for the middle wheel drilled off center. This causes the wheel to rub against the handle and not roll at all. Since one wheel doesn't roll you can't use that end since it hurts to drag a stuck wheel across your back. It's a great back scratcher for the money though!

I purchased this to replace an Earth Therapeutics wrap that is similar in size/function (for your back) but has velcro closure rather than tie. The velcro became very worn out on it, but as much as I used the other brand (I've had chronic sciatica for nine+ years, three back surgeries and an spinal cord impant so I know back pain!) I will purchase the other in the future when this Thermalon wears out. The thing that attracted me to trying this product was that it states it is machine washable (the other brand was not) however I have yet to try washing the Thermalon. I don't feel like it retains heat as well as the previous brand I owned either (had it for about 4 years)."

I saw these and thought it was a good deal as it was the cheapest price I could find.When I started using my razors, I noticed immediately that I was not getting the close and comfortable shave I had with my older razor. I thought maybe one out of my box of 12 might have been dull, so I tried another razor. Unfortunately, that one had the same problem.These razors work, but they could be better.

After all that these are usable and should do the job."

I bough this because the POP Kili is.a littlte too sweet and I was hoping this unsweetened extract would add ginger but no honey or sugar and therefore balance it to my tastse. Didn't get there since this isn't quite strong enough to overwhelm the sugar. Guess the honey is necesaty to the extraction process. Don't know why,"

So basically the product will be gone after two uses, unlike other Nair products, such as the 15-minute microwaveable warm wax.

16769,0,"OK. Do you know what an erection ring is? It's a device that wraps tightly around the base of a man's penis, slowing the flow of blood out, allowing for a harder, longer-lasting erection. We have tried, and liked, the stretchy, rubber kind, but we decided to go ahead and give this doodad a try.The stud ring works like one of those bola ties. You place the loop over the penis, and then pull the string tight, through the bead. When everything goes right, it fits nice and tight, working like a charm on the blood flow, with excellent results. It's also nice for the man, in that there is less there to interfere with...contact.The bad news is that the sliding bead can also trap pubic hairs, resulting in exquisite pain that is certain to interfere with the moment. So, if you really want to use this product, then you will have to shave the scrotum area. If you don't want to shave down there, then stick with the stretchy rings, they are less hassle.So, my final analysis is good, but imperfect.(Review of California Exotics / Swedish Erotica Julian's Stud Ring)"

147680,0,I have been switching all my hair care products over to shampoos and conditioners that do not contain sodium laureth and other harm chemicals as well as house hold cleaners. I have done plenty of research on all the chemicals we put into our bodies on a daily basis. Based on reviews I tried this as well as John Masters and a few others. First thing I noticed was a medicine type smell. I didn't notice any difference in the volume and it seem to leave a slight residue in my hair. I am a shampoo junkie and have tried just about everything that is out there. I think that John Masters and Derm Organics have much better products that do not contain harmful chemicals. Also Bumble & Bumble has a great thickening shampoo and conditioner however they do contain a few extras in the ingredients but not to the extent of many that are on the market today. This also took quite sometime to arrive.

142021,0,"The Carex Round Shower Stool is a good fit for a normal size bathtub or shower stall.I like this product however Carex could make this into a great product instead of a just OK product by making two changes.1. The Carex Round Shower Stool is a little bit flimsy. By adding crossbars to the legs of the stool would give this product a much more secure feeling as well as being able to support more weight.2. The seat is molded plastic which is fine but there are no holes in the seat for water to drain from. So when you sit on it when wet and then stand up, the standing water on the stool acts as a seal between the plastic seat and your butt and the stool (because it is so light weight) tends to stick momentarily until the weight of the seat breaks the seal and falls back down. The recommendation here is for Carex to add some water drainage holes.With those changes this would be a great product. The product as currently designed is adequate."
186007,0,"My wife was very excited to try this one, but over all was disappointed. The rubbery feel and smell are a turn off, as others have noted. You have to use a lot of lube or it snags on the way in. She liked the length and was able to easily use it with both hands or one hand. Excellent for deep penetration but the rubbery texture pulls her pubic hair. Also felt it was just a bit to big around for comfort vaginally, but for anal fun it really does the job. We still use it regularly, but it's not the first toy she reaches for."
309793,0,"I'm glad I didn't pay the $200+ retail price for this shaver. Even at $160 I'm very disappointed. I'm a long time Norelco user and I thought I'd give this a shot as I wasn't happy with how the Norelco did around my neck area. I'm thin, so my face/neck doesn't have extra skin, so it's tough to get the hair in certain areas. This shaver does really well on my face, a much closer shave then my old Norelco shaver. Also, this has the best darn trimmer I've ever seen, 10x better then Norelco. However, I think it does worst on my neck. If I ever want to look extra clean I use a regular shaver for my neck.Advise to make your cleaning solution last much longer. First, clean your shaver every 4 times you shave, no need to do it everytime. Second, manually take the foil off and shake the hair out of it so you don't get your solution dirty. With this method you can expect about 3-4 months out of 1 solution.Bottom line: I can get a top end Norelco off eBay for about $75. At 2x the price, it's simply not worth it. If money isn't an issue, then by all means."

10495,1,"There is no other choice really when using the Philips Sonicare Elite handle.Coming from an Oral-B Triumph FlossAction brush head product, the Philips Sonicare E Series brush head is more gentle, yet more powerful in cleaning action thanks to the sonic technology.I didn't appreciate the fact that with Oral-B you had so many different kinds of brush heads specifically ""marketed"" for a specific use. More importantly, the high-end FlossAction brush head could not be used for people using all kinds of braces. I did write and inquire with Oral-B and they did confirm and pointed me to purchasing the Oral-B Ortho brush head. If I wanted to polish my teeth, why they just had one specifically called the ""PowerPolisher"". I mean, is this really necessary granted I see a dentist every 6 months and yet I have to buy into the hype.SONICARE E SERIES...So I instead bought into the Sonicare Elite brush which offers the standard or the compact head. That's it. Let the power of the sonic technology blast away dirt stuck on your tooth.The brush head is simple, yet powerful. You feel your teeth and gums squeaky clean. I then wrote Philips and they said it was safe to use with braces.Compared to Oral-B FlossAction, the brush handles the gums with more care and less sensitivity experienced. I can only wish I chose this brand sooner. I thought Oral-B would be a better brand, but it turns out to be only more expensive and less efficient in handling the brushing power.HOWEVER...I can't give it perfect stars for the following reasons:1. Philips Sonicare used to state to replace their brush heads every 6 months which makes it more economical and efficient. However, they have now revised this and instead cut the life span in half and imitated the others in suggesting 3 months of use between replacement.Perhaps they decided to double their profits, realized the user odor complaints from residue build-up or made their brush heads less efficient to facilitate faster replacement.2. Needs waterproofing which apparently does not exist between the handle and brush head up to the Sonicare Elite line. There silicone gasket does not properly seal water, toothpaste and saliva from entering into the screw base of the handle. If you don't regularly dismantle the brush head from the base handle then you will develop bacteria and gunk causing a foul odor.The only solution is to redesign this E Series brush head as well as create a watertight seal in between the screw in of the base. This may not come at all because Philips brought out their FlexCare toothbrush line which imitate into the design of the Oral-B power brushes by having a small metal rod stick out of the handle. No more screwing of the brush head to the handle means eliminating the chance of water going into the crevices.An alternative solution is to purchase a third-party silicone insert wrapping into the head. I don't buy into this because it doesn't eliminate the need to wash your toothbrush on a regular basis. And second, it doesn't guarantee that water, saliva and toothpaste will NOT enter in between the silicone wrap and brush head this time. So now you have double duty to clean in between the silicone.The best solution for me is to simply wash the brush head and base each and every time after brushing. It's a simple unscrewing action to wash away bacteria and let both air dry while disassembled. If you start with this method, you will find it a natural part of the routine.IN THE MEANTIME...Time will tell if Philips decides to improve this E Series line or totally eliminate it in place of the FlexCare line.Although the cost of the brush head is more than the cost of a manual toothbrush, you can't even begin to compare and imagine the efficiency of a power toothbrush let alone a sonic power toothbrush to help eliminate and whiten your teeth.If you haven't made the switch, I believe this is a good time to invest in a power model and especially the Sonicare Elite model for you and your family."

134950,0,"The product is well presented and packaged, the design is pleasant and functional. The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser does what it is expected to do and I would give it 4 stars if it was not for a few minor aspects that could and should be improved. First of all the water reservoir is to small, it only last a minute or so, thus requiring the user to stop, refill and continue with the cleaning. A tank with at least 1.5 to 2 times the present capacity is required in order to complete the cleaning of a normal 32 teeth mouth.Then there is the 10 different settings pressure control dial, when actually you are really only using the top pressures (from 7 to 10), all the other lower ones are not producing enough pressure to clean your teeth and effectively remove food residuals. I understand that some people might have sensitive gums or some kind of condition that forbids them to use higher pressure, but maybe if you have these kind of problems shouldn't be using this kind of flosser and resort to other less invasive methods to get the best result.The reservoir cover has also a very useful tip storage compartment, the only problem is that it only holds 4 of the 6 tips you are given. Even if you keep one of the tip on the handle, you have no storage space left for the sixth tip. It also tends to slip and fall into the reservoir when you are moving it.Finally the coiled semi-rigid tube connecting the handle to the unit is not the ideal type of connection, it's to short and thus restricting your movements to much, it tends to get in the way of your hand holding the handle and it starts to collect some of the water dripping from your mouth on to the handle and spills it outside the sink area. The rigidity of the tube facilitate its auto-folding back into storage position, but at the same time it is not practical when flossing and not very ergonomic.Now even with all the minor problems described above I recommend this product as I found it is a very good tool to improve one's oral hygiene, at a very good price for the quality you get and in every aspect much better than any other flossing method."
120412,1,"These batteries are great when used with the compatible Rayovac 15-minute charger. I even timed it, and indeed, the batteries are fully charged in 15 minutes. Or if you are really in a hurry, I believe you can get about 50% charge in 5 minutes.The batteries do get hot during recharge, but that is expected per the Rayovac user instructions. There is a fan in the unit that cools things off.The Rayovac IC3 system has the trade-off of having to use the IC3 batteries/charger from Rayovac to get the 15-minute recharge, but I think it is a reasonable trade-off given the price and performance.I have used them in an older power-hungry digital camera, among other things, and they have performed as expected."

316170,0,"This body fat tester is designed to evaluate your body fat percentage by measuring just one spot (an inch above your Anterior Superior Iliac Spine, or hip ""pointer""), with this thickness then being cross-referenced against the included table to arrive at a percentage reading. Actually, two tables are included: one for men and one for women. The tables seem to be created from a cross-section of average men and women. Most likely, if you gain fat like an average man or woman (stomach first for man, hips/butt first for women is my guess) then this would give you a roughly accurate reading. Unfortunately, neither me nor my wife get fat like normal people (nor do we do much else like normal people, for that matter.) Needless to say, I'm a little overweight, yet it told me I was ""lean,"" and my wife is also a little overweight and it told her she was ""borderline obese."" I haven't had it checked yet, but my guess is that a professional using a more expensive device and several areas of body fat ""pinching"" would arrive at a much more accurate reading. Hope this helps."

The monitor's predicted period of ovulation coincided with physical signs, so it seems accurate. It showed me that I ovulate at different times each cycle. So far, I have not conceived even though my husband and I are otherwise healthy and conceived our first child with nothing other than sheer dumb luck the first month of haphazardly planned intercourse.I am going to continue trying and I am glad I purchased this product, but just because you have intercourse while this machine indicates peak fertility, it does not guarantee success."

The design is beautiful, the razor are simple to install, no issues. But I have used this setting on every level and I continued to get cut. Now, in the morning, when I'm getting myself ready for work, I don't have time to stand in front of my mirror with a styptic pencil or with bloody tissue paper attached to my face. I especially had issues on my neck and chin. I always tried to let the well balanced head do all the work, but either I would miss spots or cut myself anyway. And it just took too long.Yes, I pre-soak my beard, I use only the best shaving creams (no supermarket stuff), pre-shave oil at times, etc. Did not matter.So last night, with a nick under my nose and another under my chin I went out and bought a new razor with a changeable head.

Now everyone seems to be into the We-Vibe, but they serve very different functions.The quality of this is great; it's good, solid silicone - none of that awful phthalate/jelly stuff! It'll hold up to vigorous use and the vibe is pretty standard issue, making it easy to replace when it inevitably dies. The packaging included some weird ""toy cleaner"" and ""intimate wipes"" (seriously?) that I completely ignored.However, while this toy has worked out well for friends, it's just not shaped right for me. I can reach my g-spot ok with this (though not as well as with other toys), but the part of it that's supposed to stimulate my clitoris just doesn't quite fit right. It's ok at g-spot stimulation, frustrating at clitoral stimulation ... in the end I concluded that I just have other toys that are much better tools for both of these tasks.

304258,0,"I love the way this shaver shaves. The shaver itself is an extremely well built-product that has lasted almost 4 years. Other reviews do a great job describing how well it shaves, so I won't repeat them.There are two caveats I need to point out:1) The cleaning system also works great but is pricey (about $60/year for the cleaning cartridges), so it's much more over time than the cost of the shaver.2) The cleaning base has a neck that presses down on the shaver to start the cleaning process that is prone to breaking. It lasted about 2 years, and then refused to stay down. Fortunately, Braun's repair facility in San Francisco replaced it. Then a year later, it broke again. I called Braun, they asked for the serial number to determine whether it was still in warranty, then authorized a repair. The SF repair facility this time insisted on repairing it rather than replacing it. It's now a year later, and it's broken again. I'm going to place another call to Braun, and hopefully they'll say that I'm still under warranty. Make sure you're close to a Braun authorized repair facility, since shipping it back is a hassle.Because of the problems with the cleaning base, and because Braun has now come out with the new, similarly priced Activator line (that still has a cleaning base but doesn't have the arm that breaks), THERE IS NO REASON TO BUY THIS SYNCRO SHAVER ANYMORE. BUY THE ACTIVATOR LINE!If Braun refuses to fix the base under warranty this time, I will definitely not pay to get it fixed (since it'll break in a year anyway) and will buy the new Activator, even though I hate to reward Braun for selling me a defective product. I may look into getting a Panasonic shaver, but since I'm otherwise so happy with the Braun, I'll probably just stay with Braun."

147213,0,"I ordered this knee guard to have support for arthritic knees. I wanted something that wasn't going to create a lot of sweat like the neoprene knee wraps do. It works. It's amazing that you can put this thing on and suddenly your knees stop clicking and you feel support. I have a couple of issues with the Kneed-It however. One is that it is hard to place the Kneed-It in the right spot. You think you have it on, and tighten it as much as you can, but then the guard slips down and out of place. So I've yet been able to locate it and tighten it on the first try. Because of this difficulty in locating the guard, I had to recommend that a friend NOT buy the guard because her knees are slightly misshapen from arthritis and it would be almost impossible for her to get the guard on and keep it in place. The second issue I have is that with the pressure you have to exert to tighten the guard enough, the little plastic brackets that hold the strap are not strong enough. Within a week, one had snapped off. The foam padding also slides out of place and if it does, the velcro strap can really dig into the back of your leg. Given that everything is in place and tightened enough, these guards work wonders. I think however, more work needs doing on the design and the durabiity of the product."

304905,1,"I'm an avid road cyclist and have been using Cytomax for about the past three years. It does appear to make good on its claims of reduction of perceived exertion and longer sustaining of energy levels. I've sufficiently experimented with other products to be able to determine, for me at least, that the benefits obtained from Cytomax are not a placebo effect.I agree with other reviewers who've stated that the salutary effects of Cytomax tend to be especially noticeable during hot weather.The consensus among several of my fellow local riders is that the Tropical Fruit flavor is by far the most palatable, and I have to agree; I personally noted very little difference in taste when the manufacturer began using Stevia as a sweetener. It's light, and never cloying, even when I increase the concentration a bit for very hot days. Highly recommended."

30325,0,"I'm not sorry that I purchased the vacuum but it does have it's limitations. When I tried to vacuum the floor of my car it wouldn't pick up even the tiniest pebbles or bits of gravel. It worked fine on the seats but it got hot after a while and turned itself off for about 20 minutes! I was sure that it was ruined but after 20 minutes it worked fine again. It worked great in the house on dust in those hard to vacuum areas like under the desk & behind the TV. Also worked great on shredded paper on the floor by the shredder. I'll enjoy having it for such things but I'll still be dragging out the 20 year old shop vac for the car. Oh, the special retriever head kept falling apart in my hands (not put together right at the factory). I had to figure out how to put the tiny belt on and snap it back together myself. Not the end of the world but when you take something like that out of the box you expect it to work."

217459,0,"I love it for it's heaviness. I had so many plans for this 32 oz bottle after reading the great reviews. I wanted to use it in my hair and on my skin. Oh my it's so thick and sticky. I just knew this is what I needed to add to those dry area such as my elbows, knees, and heels. Yes, it works great for those areas only but as an all over moisturizer NO...too sticky. I was hoping this would be my next bath oil...no too thick. I wear my hair natural so I just knew this would be a great moisurizer for my thick mane. Yes, it moisturizes well, but it's so thick to rub in and not to mention the smell is not something you would want to leave on your hair. I'm sorry this is not going to work for me. I will use it for problem areas until it's gone or to use as an hot oil treatment. More than likely won't buy again. I will stick to my Hot Six Oil and it's much cheaper."

3006,0,"Some years ago I used what was then called the Crown Skinless Skin condom, which are now sold with the simple moniker of Crown Condoms. I was very pleased with this original product. It's thin, strong structure held up under some of the most strenuous ""loads"" that I could produce and contributed to the advertised ""feels like you're wearing nothing"" experience. Light lubrication and a skin-toned color only contributed to this adage.What I received from my recent order was not the same condom, even if it was advertised as such. At first, these condoms seemed to promise the same feeling, but all I can say is that they were not ""lightly"" lubricated - they were practically not lubricated at all. And that would be fine (I happen to like non-lubricated condoms) but for some reason this condom was no easier to apply than one drenched in lubrication.During use I found it somewhat constrictive. It did not contribute to a comfortable experience. When I finally DID manage to reach my climax, I realized the only reason that was possible was because the condom broke! Thankfully my partner is on birth control so no surprises were in store for us.The only truly positive aspect of this condom? It's VERY inexpensive when bought in numbers. My math makes my purchase work out to about 8 cents per condom. Can't beat that."
418715,0,"Just like listening to the Spice Girls, good old Carmex brings me back to my childhood. A classic standby, Carmex offers a refreshing menthol feeling and glossy finish - not to mention a price tag that's hard to beat. The consistency of the yellow gel is rather delightful - slippery enough to glide easily on the lips, but sticky enough to adhere for decent lasting power. I enjoy the signature scent, but keep in mind that it may not appeal to everyone. On the downside, Carmex doesn't provide enough moisture for my very dry lips. While the balm feels soothing when initially applied, it returns my lips back to their desert-like state as it wears off.Read more reviews at [...]"

I found that my rolling, and capturing it under my left arm, I can get the bag on.awkward to roll and get bag on by yourself - see suggestion above.spring action is weak, will hold bag open in upright position, collapses in when laid on the side - still works, just so so.really temperature sensitive: hardens slightly in cold, softens slightly in the warm. Still works, just not as well.It does work, haven't found anything that takes it place, at least without being more awkward. Not sure how they could fix it, and don't let this sway you away from it - just know what you are getting."

338223,0,"Okay, I know my title has nothing to do with the actual function of the cane, but really- did the manufacturer have to put FIVE long, sticky labels that don't peel off without peeling my fingernails down to stubs on the cane? No, they didn't. I had to scrape them up w/ a plastic scraper, and that still left behind the adhesive, which looks so great...not. The cane comes with no instructions for proper grip use or height adjustment, which was annoying. You get what you pay for. It's heavyweight to lift, and you'd better lay it against something secure, because if it drops to the floor, it makes quite a loud noise. I do like the rubberized grip & bottom (my old cane lacked both, as it was wooden). It supports heavier people, that's for sure. The hand grip is nice & comfy, with it's grooves for each finger. I personally can still lift heavy items, I just have crappy knees, meaning that I need help for steps & curbs. I couldn't buy this cane for someone like my grandmother, who has little upper-body strength, and expect her to be able to lift this sucker. With Amazon Prime, it got here in two days, with free shipping. I love Amazon,I'm just not thrilled with the distributor for both the lack of instructions (and, no, they weren't on the sticky labels, those were just advertisements) & the thoughtlessness regarding putting decals all over the cane. This doesn't stand up on it's own, though since it's not a quad cane, I figured that'd be the case. But forewarned is forearmed. This is easy to adjust- just move this little metal button in & out of a series of holes- but again, I really have no idea what setting is ""ideal"" on this cane for my height (I'm 5'7 & a 1/2"" tall). I'd recommend spending more & getting something of better quality, or attempting to get a good cane through your own durable medical equipment coverage via your health insurance. Often, canes are covered at least at 80% of cost, as long as you get them through a medical equipment vendor that your insurance accepts. Since I'm uninsured for now, I didn't have that option."
191999,0,"Had I had a picture of the opposite side of this brace, I would not have ordered it. Yes, they explained that the laces offer good support, but they didn't say that it looks like a roller skate on the side that the world sees. How many people think I'm Edward Lacehands meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre killers I do not know. But, I do know I dislike the way the brace looks immensely and am glad I ordered it for a minor surgery and not daily wear for carpal tunnel. Aside from that, the brace does offer good support and feels strong like a nice denim. But, it is a bit large for me; even though it is for 6.5-7.5, it is somewhat loose for my 6.5 wrist. Despite being a bit large, the brace still irritates the base of my thumb a lot to the point of bruising, but I've dealt with it since even crutches bruise you... so there are some discomforts to healing that maybe cannot be avoided. Then again, I once used a Futuro brace and had no such issues. Perhaps these are the drawbacks of quite a sturdy brace. Bottom line: I would have stuck with a brace from a local store that I could return if uncomfortable or ordered the cheaper braces on Amazon."

50129,0,"As a person who needs to wear a knee brace on an everyday- all day basis, I found one important fault with this brace. The back of the brace has some sort of mesh material that is abrasive on the back of the leg right at the bending position and makes it uncomfortable to wear. When you first put the brace on, it feels good. After wearing it for about an hour, you feel the mesh cutting in to the back of the knee and it hurts. I then have to place a tissue inside the brace to block the mesh from the back of the leg and that is not an easy thing to do. Also the top of the brace tends to fold over.I actually like the way the rest of the brace is structured and hope that eventually the mesh softens enough for everyday wear. I think that the description should state that the mesh exists and maybe even why they chose to add it to the product."

374658,0,"I have always used a standard, electric trimmer - the sort you use to cut hair. My old one died recently, and I decided to try this one.First, I'm not delighted with the way it cuts. I have to assume that my disappointment is largely with the change from an electric trimmer to a battery one, but I have no way to validate this. It could be that all battery trimmers have the same downsides.Second, the downsides that I'm not happy about are primarily in how the blades cut. It's a much slower process, and you can expect some pulling. I find I need to slowly make several passes to get a complete trim.While I've heard that these blades could sharpen a bit over time, this seems a bit dubious to me. I'm assuming this is as good as it gets, and that this is just the nature of a small, battery powered trimmer. If I had it to do over, I'd go ahead and get another electric trimmer and avoid the aggravation."

308617,0,"I used this for both my hair and skin.I have really dry skin and this coconut oil work great for it. Since my skin is really dry, I had to use a lot of it. I used it all over my body twice a day (after I showered). I notice that I was going through the jar quickly and started to use less and less. I decided that for this price I could get some lotion and some baby oil and get the same results. It feels like if someone took all of the good things you like from lotion and baby oil and made a super product. Now for my skin I use it for extremely dry spots (hands, knees, elbows, etc). If I wasn't in a financial bind I would use it as much as possible, but that's not the case. It really does work good though.For my hair, I found a few people on the internet that swear by coconut oil and decided to give it a try.I have extremely coarse, thick, african american (all natural) hair and was skeptical about it at first but gave it a try. I didn't like it the first few times because I hadn't found the right amount to put in with my other hair products. It was either way to little which kept my hair dry or too much which made it greasy. After finding the right amount to place in my hair, I have no complaints. I use it to lock moisture in my hair and to replace traditional hair grease for your scalp.All complaints aside it is a good product. I love how it came in a glass jar because I was a bit worried from the picture. I will say that even though you don't have to refrigerate it I found myself having to because of 90 degree weather. But sit it out for a few minutes and the constancy will go back to normal."

Note that The T-edjer II has a slightly wider blade and doesn't work as well for mustache trimming. I guess I'll probably keep it but I'd be happier with the other model.I've had it most of a year now and must say I really like it.One thing though, be sure not to leave it sitting base down on counter that gets wet because the electrical contacts will corrode. A wire brush fixed it but I'm more careful now.* I've had the trimmer for just over 11 months and today the battery died. NIMH batteries are very susceptible to damage from overcharging. As far as I can tell the charger with this trimmer is just a dumb charge all the time type. I'll probably go with corded from now on but what I intend to do if I try another one of these is instead of leaving it on the charger all the time to charge for a day then take it off the charger until I think it should be about run down then charge for another day. BTW the battery is soldered in on this unit so it can't be replaced unless you want to get into that."
344906,0,"Hey I'm in my early 20's and I just ordered this tea, because my fiance and I would like to have a baby soon. Now I don't know the effects yet. However from reading the reviews I'm hoping that I will be pregnant soon. Now a little backstory about me; I was on depo the past four months and I'm due on November 16. We haven't started trying, but I would like to pregnant sometime in late November or early December. I think it's good, probably because I always drink mint tea, and you get a lot for what it's worth. I would like for this tea to help me re-regulate my ovulation since I haven't been ovulating for the past four months, that way I can track it and know my fertile days. I will update as soon as I see a faint positive or positive or get a for sure answer by the doctor that I am pregnant.Thanks for reading!Update: 11/7/2012 (Not pregnant yet, but bleeding accompanied with pelvic pain) :(I started drinking this tea back in early October and around the 16th I started bleeding along with some lower pelvic pain. I'm not sure if this normal, I was due for depo in Nov. but I need to figure out why I started bleeding in October. I am still bleeding and tomorrow (11/8/2012) I'm getting a pelvic exam to see what's going on. It might just be the depo ridding out of my system. Hopefully that's it because this is too long to be bleeding."

21141,0,"I want to love this heating pad, really I do. It's big enough to get where I need it to, it delivers hot moist heat automatically, but the one thing I can't get over, is that you have to keep your hand on the switch the entire time in order to deliver the heat. I used it regularly for constant back pain, but when I lie on the bed, in order to place the pad where I need it to be, and in the position I need to lie so I'm close enough to where the power cord is in the wall, I still have to contort my arm in order to grab the heat switch and keep it delivering heat. Its just become too hard. I understand the theory behind the hand help switch, but couldn't they just put a timer or auto shut off or something. It is VERY inconvenient to contort to keep this thing hot. It feels so good when it's working, but there has to be a better way to use it."
424851,0,"Bottom line, I love the ""wicking"" feel but hate the adhesive. Almost worth it to put up with the bad adhesive if they were cheaper than the Lansinoh.I went with the Lansinoh pads for the first three months because they were cheaper. I bought some Medela disposable nursing pads when they were on sale at Babies R Us. I bought a month's supply. ARGH. They drove me crazy the first two weeks b/c every time I went to pump, they were displaced. Thankfully dropping my bra to pump displaced it so I wasn't leaking all over my clothes, but it gets to be annoying. As some others have mentioned, there is only one adhesive and it's adhesive quality is a bit ... lacking. I almost threw them all out but decided to stick with it BECAUSE they actually FEEL better than the Lansinoh ones. These have a thin cottony layer across the top that almost feels like muslin and it's like your leaks go through it, soaks into the gel part but you don't feel it against your nipple. When you pull it away, you don't feel the gelled bit surrounding your nipple as much either. I really like feeling dry so I've put up with the crappy adhesive. Last positive, I like how easy open the plastic is for each pad. In the end, if I were going to pump for much longer, I'd probably go to the Medela brand...as it stands I think I've got only a month or two left in me...and since the Lansinoh is cheaper, I'll probaby just do that...ps...maybe it just feels drier b/c I'm not leaking as much? :)"

I've found that it even burns my lips a little sometimes, so I try to put on chapstick before popping a tea tree stick in my mouth. My only complaint is that these seem to splinter very quickly, much more so than the Preserve brand. If you're a gnawer like I am, you might find yourself with unpleasant splinters and wood bits floating around in your mouth. Be careful! I do really love the flavor, but when I run out I might try a different brand to see if I can avoid the splintering problem."

175723,2,"First of all, I don't derive any pleasure from writing bad or negative product reviews. But I'm afraid in this case I have no choice but to voice my opinion of this Remington R-960 electric razor. I have been shaving with electric razors for 30 plus years now. I've used all models of Norelco and Remington triple-header razors over the years as well as Remingtom Micro Screen electric razors (which I currently use). And I'm sorry to have to report that this is probably the worst one I've ever used. (Yes, before you ask, I do always use a pre-electric shave lotion prior to shaving). The first morning I used this Remington R-960, I felt nothing out of the ordinary. Felt pretty much like any other electric razor. About 15 to 20 minutes after I finished shaving I began to notice a burning-type feeling around my neck/throat area. About an hour later I really felt this burning sensation. I was about to leave for work when I did a quick 'mirror check' in the bathroom and HOLY COW!! My neck and throat area was bright red and all swollen! And I mean BRIGHT RED and SWOLLEN! No wonder the burning sensation I was feeling. I looked like I just finished (trying to) shave with a gas powered hedge trimmer! I got to work and the guys I work with were like ""Holy Crap!! What happened to you?"" ""Why, I just shaved with my brand new Remington R-960 this morning. Why do you ask"", I sarcastically replied. They said it looked like someone took a chain saw to my throat! You get the idea. The bottom line ... it took approximately 6 days for all of the redness and swelling to entirely clear up in my neck/throat area. Needless to say, that morning which was the first time I used my new Remington R-960 electric was also the LAST time I used it. I haven't touched it since. Frankly and if I may be honest here, I'm a little frightened of the thing now. It's like it had a mind of it's own and it bit me but good. Now, each morning when I'm shaving with my Remington MS2-300 Micro Screen (not triple head) razor, I sort of have a tendency to keep one eye on the little monster as it is still sitting there on the shelf near the sink and mirror, patiently waiting for the next time I'm foolish enough to pick it up again. You have been warned!"

286723,0,"If you get this as replacement for your Norelco shaver... be aware that it has to be soldered into the shaver... quite a tricky operation which requires a major dis-assembly, using a solder gun to remove the old battery and nimble fingers to get the new one installed and re-assembled. Be sure to mark the positive side on the printed circuit board so you can install the battery with the correct polarity. So far it accepts a charge and runs the shaver about the same speed as the OEM battery... which lasted about 4 years with not much use."

216513,0,"Being a connoisseur of Xanax ER and Valium and Ativan and other delightful seditives I decided to order some of these for a male friend of mine who is a raging beer drinker and a slight Texas redneck. When the bottle arrived he opened the bottle, and took a small sniff of the contents and threw the bottle down. This is not anything to do with the company I am rating. All Valerian root smells like a fish corpse in the hot sun packed in a cooler for 10 days. It took 3 more days for the small brained man to be convinced to try it. It clearly states take 2. He decided to take 4. WITH beer. And several hits of medical grade pot. Bad idea. He started to play guitar and really groove with the moment of the new nature herb of relaxation. An hour later he hit the floor. Four hours later he woke to loud deep flatulence coming from 3 directions. His nether region and the nether regions of both his dogs. You see when the redneck fell asleep he forgot to put them up off the table and for some reason the 2 dogs thought the rotting fish smell tablets smelled like cupcakes and ate them all. Very sad. Both dogs were frantically circling the small brain man and sniffing the air like hounds after coons. The redneck jumped up let the dogs out and felt an explosive power trying to escape his nether region. He then preceded to sit on the toilet for the rest of the night while nodding off every few minutes. Point is this stuff makes you sleepy, kind of like a Tylenol PM however does it calm nerves? No. Panic attacks? No. Its just an herb which has an effect on certain people to get a little sleepy. I cant make a total judgement on this product because I have no use of it, considering I take Xanax. I only observe what it has done for others. I give it a 3 for light weights who want to feel sleepy. I give it a zero for anything that is sedating. I will say The company Natures Way is a highly recommended company with high quality products. Do not take with beer or take more than 2 or on an empty tummy. If your a redneck it might not be good either."

100148,0,"I bought this today (not from Amazon, but from a Fry's nearby) based on all the good reviews, so was surprised to find some obvious, annoying drawbacks. I think the unit has a motor much stronger than the body that houses it, with the result that the body vibrates uncomfortably and gets annoyingly warm. If the plastic guide is not seated right, you hear this very loud noise that will make your heart skip a beat. And last but not least, the rocker switch button offers a lot of resistance. If you frequently turn it on-off during a 10-15 minute cut, as you adjust, change guides, and take pauses, your thumb will start hurting.I had a 5 year old Remington, ten dollars more expensive, that never had these issues. Of course, it's motor was probably not as powerful, but I did not find it needing any more than what it already had.One plus for this Wahl unit is that the blades feel a bit sharper - but I cannot tell for sure, and in any case, it is too early to say if it will stay that way."

144227,0,"Doggone Pain, or DGP, is a supplement for pets which helps with arthritis and other types of pain. I hide the meds in Pill Pockets and other treats, and so far, my 13 year-old Sheltie and 10 year-old Husky mix seem to be doing quite well with this supplement, and they are prancing around like six or seven year-olds. This may be best taken with other supplements and medications, such as glucosamine-chondroiton and Metacam, but it certainly seems to work for the beginning stages of arthritis."

I get no such sensation with this toothpaste.The toothpaste also does not contain flouride. That might be a plus for some, but I believe in using flouride when I brush my teeth since I only drink filtered or bottled water.The toothpaste does have a nice taste; it's not too sweet and is honestly one of the best tasting toothpastes I've used.I would only recommend this if the price were about 6 bucks a tube."

178476,2,"I bought this when I was shopping for my unborn baby. He is almost 10 months and I can honestly tell you that I tried to use this product, but it was unnecessary for me and my husband. The concept is great, to electronically time all of these various things (naps, feedings, diaper changes, etc), but it is not as efficient as it seems.Firstly, the battery life is not good. It just eats batteries, even when it is doing nothing. Secondly, even if your newborn has ate just an hour ago and has napped long before that time, it does not mean that your baby is not hungry. This concept applies to diaper changes, feedings, naps, etc.) The only real indicator is your baby... and believe me when I tell you that your newborn will find a way to tell you what he or she wants. Also, since you haven't recorded how long it has been that your baby last slept or how much your baby has last ate (particularly if you are using formula or bottled breast milk), this product really falls short.Honestly, I wanted to love this and use this like some other parents say they had, but it was one of those completely unnecessary purchases we made hoping to make life with a baby easier. This product was frustrating.Me and my husband found that it was easier and more efficient to simply use a notepad. We wear watches, so we just recorded the time of each activity (i.e. what time baby went to sleep and how long he slept , what time baby ate and how much he ate). This product doesn't have a log, so you couldn't possibly look back on the activity throughout the day or week and measure how much baby has been eating and sleeping. It is just a set of different timers.I would not buy this product again and I cannot recommend it to anyone. I think the standard notepad is the best option.Also, another option that I think would be great for this purpose is an iphone/ipod/ Smartphone APP called the Similac Smartmoms Baby Journal. It is completely free to download onto any device that reads APPS. It has all the same functions of this device but includes pictures as well as a chance to mark how full baby's diaper was at his last change. Also, it keeps a log of all these activities for a very long time and greats graphs to determine trends. Technology is so great these days. Go on similac.com/app to check it out. I only found out about this app when my son was already 6 months old and I don't really use it, but I think it would be great for new parents and especially better than the Itzbeen Baby Care Timer. Good Luck and Congrats to all you new parents!"

108274,0,"I up picked the travel version of this because I recently started shaving with a double-edge razor, and wanted to continue using mug soap and a brush. Col. Conk's travel soap seemed like the way to go. The actual shave experience is all pretty good - the bay rum scent was pleasing, it lubricated the blade well enough, and I had no problems achieving a decent lather. My first shave with this soap was in New York. I noticed that it didn't want to rinse cleanly, and suspected that maybe it was the local water. So, I tried it at home, and had the same result (I'm used to Detroit water, and the water here is pretty soft.) I don't think I'd ever buy this for home use, and I might purchase a different brand for travel (not because it's bad... it's just not great.) Over all, I think I like Van Der Hagen's Luxury shave soap more. About the same price, same experience, but it rinses off way easier."

197318,0,"I had high hopes for this product - but unfortunately while it offers some relief, it simply doesn't last. I have issues with my nose that sufficient wind/air movement in my nose will shut them down so I can't breath through them. This is complicated further since I have Sleep Apnea and use a CPAP machine, which pushes air/wind into my nose. I have to use a small amount of oxymetazoline nasal spray in 1-nostril, every night to be able to sleep.So I decided to give this a try. The initial ""burn"" wasn't as bad as some folks say (I have used topical capsaicin which is waayyy hotter). I tried using Sinus Buster a few times throughout the day, before trying it for sleeping. While it did open my sinus' a bit, it wasn't dramatic. The night I tried it for sleeping, I used it at 10pm (my sinus was mostly open/clear) but by 1am I awoke unable to breath through my nose.I realize other negative comments are by folks who are addicted to standard/oxymetazoline nasal spray. I am not like that. I use 1/2 to 1 (standard dosage is 2-3 sprays) 12-hour spray usually in 1-nostril only, to reduce sinus shutdown by the air pushed by the CPAP machine (no, humidity doesn't help. I can put the machine on max moisture/humidity and I will simply drown in the excess moisture not getting into my nose) and that is all. The 12-hour spray usually last 24-hours."

I don't really notice a big difference. It still looks the same to me, it just looks more lifted and firm. I'm still a 34A though. So I can't really say if it works or not because like I said it's only been half a month and they said for permanent results it has to take like 3 to 6 months or more if you want them even bigger. It's weird though because sometimes they feel heavy and then the next day I feel nothing. But I'll tell you more by the end of this month."
24994,0,"Tried this product on a whim for one month. Not sure it was so smart of me. I was another 'regular' girl, every 28 days like clockwork. I tried this for only one cycle, and only 2 pills a day (as opposed to 3) and I ended up ovulating on Day 18 and my period lasted 34 days. Absolutely unheard of. The only issue is that I happened to get my hormone levels tested during this one month, and both my LH/FSH AND my Progesterone levels were great, so I am not sure if I can attribute this to Fertil-aid. I also had fewer PMS symptoms that I have ever had in my life! So the jury is out on this one!In any case, I decided to stop it immediately so I can get back to my 'regular' 28-day cycles and take it from there. I guess it's better-suited to those who don't ovulate every month or have irregular stuff going on. I see how it can really help. But like the other reviewers, I'd be very wary if you have a regular cycle. I fear it messed me up."
317825,0,"I bought this shaver thinking it was better than my old Quad Norelco. It is not because it doesn't have some of the features I expected. I am disappointed that what was a simple Norelco shaver now has so many features that it is impossible to tell the better ones from the standard ones, except for prices differences. When I look on the web (Amazon and Norelco) it would be great if there was a side-by-side chart comparing all the fetures of all the Norelco shavers. That would do a lot to help customers sort out which features and prices range work the best for them. It is easier to buy a car because at least the manufacturer has grouped the options so that customers don't have to look at 20 simular but different cars (other than colors)."
110510,1,"My daughter has suffered from severe pustular psoriasis since she was a toddler or maybe earlier. Her flare-ups usually cover her entire torso from neck to waist, front and back, and sometimes cover her legs to the ankles, too. After going from Pediatrician to Dermatologist to a top Pediatric Dermatologist, we finally got a definitive diagnosis when she was 4. And after trying a number of prescription and OTC medications and treatments, we finally got control of it when she was 5 using a combination of methotrexate (taken orally) and this product, Cutar, applied topically. The methotrexate seems to keep her about 95% clear all on its own, and the Cutar takes care of the few remaining spots and patches. Between the two we can keep her nearly 100% clear most of the time. The Cutar is also pretty effective on its own when applied 2-3 x per day, as we discovered when we had to take her off the methotraxate for a spell to allow her immune system to help her kick an ear infection: she flared up when she went off the methotrexate, we responded with more frequent applications of Cutar, and the flare started to die down. She was back on the methotrxate before the Cutar was able to get full control of it and that helped to clear it up more quickly, but the Cutar was definitely having having a strong effect all on its own. Also, because it's a liquid, Cutar is easy to apply *gently* over large areas. This is important to us since the pressure needed to rub thicker creams and ointments onto my daughter's skin is often painful to her. With Cutar we warm the bottle in the sink for a few minutes, pour a capful, dribble it onto her skin, and gently smooth it over the affected areas - almost no pressure required. Those who use a lot of it like we do should know that you can buy in bulk (1 gal. vs. 6 oz.) direct from the manufacturer, Summers Laboratories, at a substantial savings."

The synthetic material smell only lasted a few weeks at most, and wasn't overwhelming in the first place. The elastic strap made it easy to add to my chair, and I rarely have to adjust it. That's the good news!The bad news is that this thing is pretty huge. That may work great for some folks; but after getting tired of being pushed toward the end of my seat, I've finally removed it. I like the support, but don't like the fact that it takes up so much of my chair. (My upper back was probably at least four inches away from my chair at all times.)This pillow definitely does the job; but I think I'll be shopping for a smaller pillow that just adds a little support to an otherwise adequately-shaped chair."
138742,0,"I am an African American female and I tried Moom last month. This is a good product, but it may not be for everyone. I found that after using Moom my hair had returned in two weeks. I was only able to use the product on one leg, both underarms, and the neck/chin area. In the starter kit there is not enough Moom or strips to do a really good job on your entire body, especially if you decide that you want to do both legs. You will need more strips and Moom if you intend to do your entire body at once. Other then that you must do one section at a time. For instance you could do your under arms, face, chin and neck with the starter kit. You would then need to clean up the strips so that you could have enough strips to do another body part. You will also need more Moom if you intend to do your legs. Note that this advise may vary. Women that don't have a lot of body hair and don't make mistakes with the Moom may be able to Moom more body areas.I reapplied Moom to the neck/chin area several time, but very little hair was removed. I believe Moom will work for some, but not all, so I wanted to give some tips to first time users so they would have the advantages that I did not. First time users will need a microwave or some way to warm the Moom; a towel, a bowl with soapy water; a wash cloth; and paper towels. Do not warm the Moom more than advised. It would be best to warm the Moom less, because your device that you use to warm the Moom may be more powerful - therefore needing less warming time. If the Moom is too hot, it will burn you. Remember as you use the Moom less will be in the jar, so the less Moom in the jar, the shorter the warming time. The goal is to make Moom easy to spread. Apply the Moom to the area of your choice in the direction of the hair. Apply the strip, ensuring that you move your hand across the strip so that it is adhered and pull the strip with a fast motion in the opposite direction. I did not find I was able to use a strip twice. Once done you can put the strip in the soapy water. By the time you are finished with your areas the strips and wooden spreader will be free from the Moom. You can rinse the strips and spreaders, then lay them on the towel to dry. By the next day they should be dry. If you make a mistake with Moom, even if it is a spill, wet the wash cloth with hot water from the tap, squeeze the extra from the cloth and wipe. You may have to be a little force with a spill. If for example you have made a mistake with the Moom on your underarm, use the wash cloth as stated previously with warm/hot water to wipe away the Moom, then use a paper towel to pat the area dry. Once dry you can reapply the Moom. Moom does clean up easily. Once you are done with the wash cloth it can be placed in the wash and washed with your regular laundry.As for the pain of ripping away the hair. I did not trim any areas before I applied the Moom. And the pain was less then waxing, but I would recommend that if you are the type of person that does not like to take splinter out of your finger, then the pain will probably be too much for you.I hope this helps. Unfortunately I will have to keep searching."

401018,0,"This unit wasn't a bad little cleaner..as long as it lasted. After about a year (I think) the handled started splitting apart and I had to squeeze the two halves together while running it so that the water wouldn't leak out and run down my hand. At about the same time, it began developing a little leak at the bottom of the base unit, which always left a little puddle of water after usage.On the other hand, the unit had plenty of pressure for MY mouth, the water container was sufficiently large for the volume output of the tip, and the coiled hose was sufficiently long.Maybe it's not so bad that it falls apart in a year or two. When the handle started falling apart, I noticed all the brown yucky junk building up inside. Maybe it was time to buy a new one anyway. Got a Waterpik this time--we'll see. So far I've noticed it has a shorter hose, runs quieter, has higher pressure and volume, and a larger reservoir."

128804,2,"I must say, I'm completely befuddled by the rave reviews. The mop performed reasonably well on my tile floor, but when I tried it on my laminate floor, it morphed into The Mop From Hell. The PVC rubber created such a friction with the laminate, it literally forced all my stomach muscles to clench just trying to get it to budge an inch! And once I got enough momentum to grind it against the surface, after a couple strokes, the head dried up and I had to start the torturous ordeal anew. Additionally, the lever to wring the mop head - while it is effective - is situated really low down to the floor. So either you have to mop with a strange neanderthal crouch, or you have to constantly joist the mop up to reach the wringer. And lastly, the scrub-ability ain't that great either. Works fine on regular blotches, but the rubber is so dense, any force you use just gets absorbed instead of directed at the stain. Yup - the immense physical strain certainly warrants it being the mop from hell..."
194470,0,"Pillow doesn't hold its shape very well.

The pillow's information stated:Product FeaturesSize: Standard* Machine-washable and dryer* Lower end for contoured support* Higher end for comfort* Lower end assists in the relief of neck and shoulder pain* Decreases morning pain and stiffnessWell....The pillow is definitely soft, and it does have the contours built in it that she wanted, HOWEVER, the pillow is just way to darned soft to offer any added support over a ""regular"" style pillow. For the price, I was very disappointed and did what I should've done in the first place - went to a local store and bought one. :)I still gave it 3 stars - it functions just fine as a regular pillow - so it isn't a total loss; just an expensive soft pillow."

This is not supposed to be a mood ring, but I'm not sure how different it really is. If it had a better design I might have more positive feelings toward it. I don't know if it's accurate or not-I'm often surprised by the reading I get, for instance; I will be in complete agony while the ring tells me I'm having the time of my life."
185107,2,I use my Green tee pills to make myself green tea(with watter and all) but with these pills its impossible. yea you can open up the pill and yea you can put them in watter but they don't mix well with watter and they tend to go down to the bottom of the bottle. so i know most people don't use pills for that but for me it wasn't the best pick.
345434,0,"It's ok. It's nice that it can switch from hard wood to tile. I just used this product for the first time since I finally finished using the bottle of Old English floor cleaner that came with the machine. I cleaned the kitchen floor first and it seemed to do all right. I did miss the clean scent that the Old English cleaner had. Next I cleaned the linoleum in the bathroom. It didn't seem to get the floor as clean as the Lysol cleaner. It didn't scrub the hairspray residue off the floor like the other cleaner does. And again, I missed the clean smell from the Lysol. The smell of this cleaning fluid borderline stinks. I don't know why Hoover had to mess up a good thing but I wish they wouldn't take the Old English cleaning fluid off the market. If I have to choose between cleaning ability and good scent or a fluid that is versatile but stinks I would choose the first one."

29686,0,"These do a decent job absorbing, but my daughter was 3 months old when I bought these, so I haven't tested them during the worst leakage time (first month for me). They're not contoured at all, so they don't stay put as well and aren't very big so they can move out of the critical position a little too easily (even for me, and I'm not very busty). Also, not being contoured, you have to wear pads over them for shape if you're going to wear a fitted shirt. They do they job, but I'm going to keep looking for something better."
192100,1,"Four stars for nice little bright yellow medical kit. The nice thing is that there's room to add more of what you desire in a medical kit, such as a supply of any prescription meds, etc. Having worked in graphic design, I know that yellow is the first color you notice, so if you need to get to this quickly, it will be easy to find. It says the bag is water-tight, which is a plus. Both the water-tight feature and yellow color make it a smart place to enclose a copy of your important documents! I included these in our emergency grab-and go bags--I already had a different first aid kit in my car. The elders in our congregation advise having a grab-and-go backpack to get family through 3 to 5 days in case of disaster. My sister works for Homeland Security, and she advises that, too. After five days, I would rely on faith in my God, Jehovah, to get me through... I was able to find everything I needed for emergency backpack on Amazon, which was nice to have it delivered instead of having to drive and search through lots of different stores. The only thing keeping me from giving this medical kit five stars is that it doesn't already include everything you'll need. But, I prefer this one due to the convenience of the size, the color, being water-tight, and the room to add more."

8520,0,PRO = The handle feels comfortable and sturdy. Very ergonomic.CONS #1 = The bristles are like a soft bristle tooth brush. Ok for light cleaning but not for scrubbing.CONS #2 = The top is too wide for cleaning baby bottle nipples. Our old clean brush tapered at the tip so it can fit narrower areas. Not a problem for cleaning coffee mugs and cups but not too great for baby bottles and other narrow at the top containers.

Would highly recommend them!!!"
23291,1,"I own and run 2 math tutoring centers and our students bring in small snacks like pretzels and crackers. We also make popcorn on occasion so our floors can get a bit messy. These units have worked very well for picking up crumbs and small objects on low pile carpet. In addition, my daughter had a friend spill a bunch of jumping beans all over our bare basement floor and this unit was a champ.I've had people comment that these work better than a electric vacuum and I rely on them a lot.What I've found after extensive use over 10-11 months is that the units stop working in part because they brushes get clogged. We have cleaned out the brushes several times cutting out hair and lint and other debris that clogs them, but the units are hardly like new. I guess this is not so bad considering the units only cost about $25. Still, if I have to purchase a new one every year - after 4-5 years that's about the same time I'd expect an electric vacuum to work. I'm not a fan of just throwing things away so I may order new brushes. We didn't use these units that heavily, maybe 3-4 times a day to pick up debris under 5 or 6 chairs and a few tables.I did call the Bissell support line to ask if they had any tips about cleaning the units and they weren't too helpful. They said I could order new brushes or order a new unitl.Overall, I'd still give this unit 4 stars as it worked very well and did what it needed to do. I wasn't looking for something to do the job of a vacuum, just a quiet unit that would clean up debris until we could vacuum after we closed and this works great for that."
377148,0,"Normally I get waxed at a local spa, but occasionally don't have the time to get in before vacation/an event/etc., so I wanted this for those times. I only got waxed a week ago, so I couldn't use it down there, but did try it on my BF's stomach (LOL) and my thighs. I would say that it works really well for a do-it-yourself wax. I had to play with the temperature a bit--ended up needing to heat it for almost 90 seconds, then broke the barrier gently to avoid the burns some other people experienced. I had no issues with this.The 4 creams included seemed to work really well (though I haven't tried the growth minimizer yet). The wax took out a good deal of hair and was really quite easy to use (even my BF wanted to get in the fun). I deducted one star because it's so super messy, but this is more user-error than product-error! I think as I practice, I'll get better at keeping the wax IN the container and not everywhere else.**Edit to add: A couple weeks after my normal spa visit, I had some fine hairs in my bikini region. I attempted to wax myself, which wasn't too difficult at all, and did get some hairs out, yes, but it's not AS good as my wax tech/spa wax at removing the very fine, blonde hairs."

I wish I had known about this first, we wouldn't have even bothered with the infant tub. Our son is now 10 months old and we still use it for every bath. Now he can sit up and play on the pillow which keeps him from slipping around. I see us using this for a long time to come and we'll be getting a second one for baby #2.Also, it's simple to ring out and as long as you let it drip dry in a semi-well ventilated area (we hang ours in the shower and just keep the curtain and door open), it will stay fresh. I've never had a problem with mustiness at all and we've been using this for 6+ months.Get it, you won't be disappointed!"
341014,0,"This is Castor Oil and Olive oil. The purpose of a preshave is to soften heavy beards for a closer and more comfy shave.

Should work out at around two bucks for 50 ml and it works a treat.Finished shaving? then use the above as an after shave balm (skin calmer), again works great!!"

I can not clean their bottoms or thier backs. Their legs get scratched and so do their, privates. I get VERY nervous that the seat will fall (so I put a stool under it just incase). Its a nightmare to clean out, (SOOO many nooks and crannies, what bright light thought to do THAT?). All in all I liked the idea, but it needs ALOT of work. Now I just use two tub rings that stick to the bottom of the tub (Less water, dont worry about them falling) And now I just have to pick one up at a time to wash their bottoms (need two people, one to wash them and one to be ready to hold one when the washer has to get the second ones bottom clean). Its pretty much the same thing, but its in ONE piece NO NOOKS AND CRANNIES and my boys LOVE them. I suggest this for all parents of multiples who bathe at the same time! If your a parent of one child I recomend one of those big tubs. SKIP THE TUP SIDE THING AND USE THE REGULAR RING! (to keep my back in check I use a step stool to sit on, or I bathe/shower with them!"

Like a lot of the reviewers, I was impressed with the first couple of shaves, but noticed the gel strips dying quickly on me in the shower. Once they fell off, I found the razor head overly cumbersome to use (especially since a standard Venus razor head is no petite thing). If I were going away and not expecting to have to shave my legs more than three times or so, this would be an excellent alternative to lugging along a shaving gel and razor. If you're looking for something to last, though, I'd go with the Venus Divine.For the best, least irritating shave, though, I find conditioner works better than shaving gel."

155943,0,"I purchased this as a more reasonably priced and comparable nutrition replacement for my prefered Vega berry mix, since the Vega formula has been changed for the worse and doubled in price.The taste is acceptable, when mixed into a smoothie. My concerns with it are that it is sweetened with fructose. I am not a fan of fructose because of the added stress to your liver to process it. The vega product was stevia sweetened, which I'd prefer. Had the ingredients been shown in the product listing, I probably would not have purchased it. I'd rather it be entirely unsweetened and let the end user add their sweetener of choice if desired. I've been using it for a few days, and feel ok, but not as good as when using the vega product. I don't believe the protein and vitamins are of the same quality. The vitamin/mineral content of the 2 products are comparable, but the vega is a more natural food based product, rather than having so many synthesized ingredients. After drinking the alive smoothie, your urine will have the typical bright yellow effect, just like you'd get from taking multivitamin pills. I did not experience this with the vega, which tells me the vega product was higher quality and the vitamins were actually being absorbed and processed by the body, not just passed through as waste.The alive product is acceptable, but I don't think I'll want to make it a part of my long term daily routine. I'll continue holding out hope that Vega will have a ""new coke"" moment and go back to the superior original formula."

282529,0,"This steth is amazing when it comes to acoustics. Everything you want to listen to is crisp and clear. I often have my fellow nurses borrowing my stethoscope when they are listening for clicks and murmurs. I honestly don't know that you could find a better stethoscope that isn't electronic.I find the soft ear pieces to be comfortable, but it did take a bit of stretching it out in the beginning to keep it from squeezing my head too much. Once it stretched out a bit, the tension has been great and applies just enough pressure to stay in my ears and create a good seal without me feeling like it is burrowing into my head.Personally, I don't really use the tunable diaphragm. When I first got the stethoscope I attempted to use it and I never got the hang of it. I have an open bell on the smaller side and it works just fine for me.The downside is that this is an incredibly heavy stethoscope. I can't wear this thing around my neck at all because my neck will start to ache in a short time. I feel like the constant pulling it in and out of my pockets coupled with constantly putting it down every where greatly increases the likelihood of it disappearing and means it is getting far dirtier than if I could just throw it around my neck.Another feature of this stethoscope that i don't particularly care for is the stickiness of the tubing. I clean it several times a shift, but it always seems to have a tackiness that I don't care for. It is so tacky that it actually picks up lint and stray hair. I contacted Littmann about this and they stated that the material that the stethoscope is somewhat tacky due to the nature of the material.This is a great stethoscope that has served me well, but am shopping for the Littmann Classic II S.E. as a replacement."

This behavior was totally uncharacteristic. I discontinued use and returned to normal within a few days. About a month later I tried it again but this time I only took one capsule a day rather than two. After a week I began having irritability problems again. I discontinued use for good.

At least I got 2 out of 3 zones, and the pain is not that bad (a lot of the reviews had me prepare for the most painful experience of my life), kind of a prickling feeling even in the underarms.I guess you'll be better by first testing how your skin reacts to the massive pulling of the hairs and then go for the whole zone!"

I expected a modern silver handle and just got cheap looking black plastic. Oh well. It wasn't that expensive I guess. It's odd that the handle is cheap plastic since the bottom brush part is crafted from nice wood and says 'made in USA' on it."
152811,0,"I tried this product for the first time about three weeks ago. I was enticed by the price - on my budget there is just no way to afford a salon straightening treatment. I have very long, extremely wavy (w/ very curly hair in the back) dark hair that is a nightmare to blow dry. However, if I'm willing to put in about 1 1/2 hours, using a very large round brush I can get my hair extremely straight. I tend to avoid flat irons as they just suck the life out of my hair. That said, I've tended toward allowing my hair to air dry and accentuating its curls. The problem with this has been the amount of frizz that can occur dependent upon the weather.Okay, so that's my ""hair background."" Here are my thoughts about the product:I followed the directions precisely - used the shampoo, dried my hair as suggested, used a little over half the bottle (**and I have very long, very thick hair - so most of you should need far less than the full bottle), dried after letting it set and then used a flat iron, going over each section at least 10 times as recommended in the directions.Pros: My hair was extremely straight and healthy. I waited 4 days to wash my hair just to ensure that it had time to set it, after I showered (with the Organix BKT shampoo and conditioner) my hair was dramatically straighter and healthier. I let it air dry and had none of the frizziness and just a bit of the wave. My hair looked great and I was happy with the results.Cons: It is a lengthy process - you'll basically need to set aside about 1/2 a day to do this properly (though, as mentioned by others, it still takes less time than a salon straightening process would). The *worst* part was the smell. At first I thought the gross - somewhat metallic, somewhat filthy, somewhat just plain gross - smell occurred because I waited too long to wash it. This wasn't the case. As long as the product was in my hair and my hair was wet, it smelled terrible to me. Once dry, the smell wasn't there. Perhaps if I had dried it every day this wouldn't have been such a big deal. To be clear, right after a shower it smelled the worst, which is a bit tragic to me. The other complaint is that though it said that it was fine to color your hair, I found that post-coloring (which I did two weeks after the treatment) the product lost its steam. That is, I wouldn't recommend coloring your hair after using the treatment. Another thing being that my hair dye was much darker than it would have been without the treatment. This is less a complaint, as I should have known better, and more a warning for those who choose to dye their hair after the treatment - my hair ended up at least two shades darker than expected.When all is said and done, I will try using the rest of my first bottle soon. However, if that smell remains an issue I will just have to suck it up and spend the $350 to get a salon treatment. I just can't handle my hair smelling so gross. Who could?"

This is a better unit than the handhelds that you can pick up in walgreens. It uses a power cord rather than batteries. If you are using it on someone else it is easy enough to hold in your hand but grips around the head would be better. The switches are easy to flip off accidentally. If you press down hard it will operate slowly making it a little less effective for deep tissue massage. The heat isn't worth mentioning. The price was too high. I think it will last but I would like to see another model with more power. I have not treid the attachments."

332643,0,"I get daily ""health tip"" e-mails, I think they come from my insurance company or something... Anyway, one that I got a couple weeks ago was about supplements that help alleviate fibromyalgia symptoms. Some of them I already take. One that the e-mail mentioned was ""brown seaweed extract"". While it did not mention THIS very product by name, if you google ""brown seaweed extract"", this product is just about the ONLY thing that comes up. That made me a little suspicious that the e-mail was ""advertising"" this brand name in a round-about sort of way since the e-mails probably can't endorse brands officially...Anyway, I decided to try this stuff because it definitely couldn't hurt-- everyone knows that seaweed is good for you even if you are healthy-- so the question is whether or not this product is going to help ease my fibro symptoms.I've been taking it about a week now-- three capsules in the morning with a full glass of water as they suggest. I think so far it's helping-- I've been in a little less pain and I've had some more energy, but I've not noticed any drastic improvements. It's hard to gauge since all along I've had good and bad days before using this product-- it COULD be coincidence that I am just having a string of good days. The real test will be after I've taken this for a month and then STOP taking it."

I wore this ankle support during those first weeks back on the treadmill and on the road. Thanks to the Amazon reviews; I feel like I made the best choice. This ankle support is made of excellent material. It is very fine quality. It's beautifully woven. Stands up to washing. It ended up in the dryer, still came out fine. (I don't suggest putting it in the dryer) Overall, I'm impressed. The gel fit right around my peroneal tendon. It protected it in a way that allowed me to wear my sneakers/shoes without aggravating the tendon. The compression was just right. It wasn't too tight. The top of my ankle measures just under 8.5, so I ordered the III. They were out of the black, so I got the blue colored featured. I would have preferred the low-key black, however the blue is muted enough."

They are red, sore, and bleed when I floss or brush my teeth. I did some research online about this and there is one bacteria in this product that is found in most cases of gingivitis. I think I may need to decrease or discontinue this all together and find something else. Maybe it causes this because it is powder and stays in your mouth after you drink it or swallow water? I love how the rest of my body is healing, but I'm not willing to loose my teeth over it!Has anyone else experienced this? I am so sad because I really want to Kick THis Candida in the BUTT!

24579,0,"Right so I'll give you my personal experience of zantrex so far. Ive never written a review so excuse the long essay lool! Ive only been on this stuff for a week so still early days, but here go's.So I ordered this stuff from the US (I'm from London) after hearing about snooki and britney etc. I knew the recommended dose was 2 pills 15 mins before each meal, but after reading the reviews, I thought I'd ease my body into it and start with one pill in the morning and at lunch, 2 pills the next morning and 1 at lunch and so on.On day 1, I took one pill as I was getting ready for work in the morning, followed by a small bowl of porridge. I felt the effects pretty quickly.. My heart started suddenly picking up (which freaked me out a lil bit, but I got over it) and I felt a 'kick' of steady energy - and can i just say, you definitely do feel a kick!! :-) I left my house and my usual 15 minute stroll to the tube station took 8 mins!! Had masses of energy off the one pill!!But as the days went on and I began increasing my pill intake, I felt continuous waves of nausea which made it a bit difficult to cope at work. I carry a massive bottle of water with me everywhere so loads of water in between the pills helps with nausea alot!! I work on a computer all day at work, and when i take it at my desk, i notice the effects (increased heartbeat and slight jitteryness/shakey hands) alot more than when Im up on my feet and busy.. So i would advise doing something active after you've eaten - if the pill doesn't get you up and moving anyway then there's something wrong with ya!! Oh and one weird thing I experienced while taking the pill without doing something active, colours got a lot more intense as I felt the 'kick' looool - sound like a druggie!Although I've increased my doseage, I have never taken 6 pills in one day (as recommended) because I'd provably throw up - and this is coming from someone with a particularly strong stomach. So i wouldnt do that. Stick to 4 a day - if that. Also, definitely avoid taking it after 3pm or YOU WILL NOT sleep! I took 1 pill around 6pm with my dinner and my eyes LITERALLY would not stay closed when I went to bed. Infact, I only got 3 hours sleep that night - which is pretty lucky. What if I had taken 2 pills?!I haven't started working out yet as pay day is this Friday - broke times- so I'll be paying my membership at the gym soon and I'll be taking it before I work out. However,I have been eating fairly balanced meals (e.g porridge for breakfast, low fat prawn and mayo sandwich & fruit for lunch, and hot soup with yogurt for dinner) and I must say I've lost a bit already.. In a week.. With no exercise except making my way to and from work on public transport. So I'm looking forward to taking it with exercise!!!So to sum up...*Do not take the recommended doseage straight away - ease your body into it. Try to take no more than 4 pills a day, or be prepared to handle the nausea and/or insomnia*Dont take it late in the day!!*Drink a hell of a lot of water both with the pill and in between dosages to avoid feeling sick*EAT PROPERLY!! If you avoid carbs and/or eat rabbit food you will feel absolutely horrible!*Put the hard work in. Eat balanced meals and work out!! I haven't started excercising yet, but running up and down escalators and on/off the tube was enough to make a small but noticable difference after just ONE week.. Imagine if I was working our properly :-DHope this helps!!"

In addition, what color that is present is somewhat uneven, and the product has a slightly grainy feel.

You can't wear anything but crew neck shirts. That eliminates pretty much everything in my maternity wardrobe. I dress modestly, I have nothing that is cleavage baring, but even still, the straps come up so high you can see them. It's really annoying when you're already so limited in clothing choice.The chest section presses on your ribs. This isn't terribly uncomfortable, but any pregnant woman will tell you this is something you REALLY want to avoid. It exacerbates heartburn quite a bit, and makes it even more difficult to breathe than it already is with a moving bowling ball pushing up into your diaphragm.It is very small.

I ordered a small which says it's good for under 5'10, pre-pregnancy pants size 3-10, and current weight of 90-165lbs. I never get past the 150s in pregnancy, so I ordered the small, worried that I should have ordered the petit. I can only get it to snap on the largest setting it has. I definitely should have got the next size up even though I'm never going to reach the minimum weight/size requirements of that size.

79208,0,"Full Disclosure: I am comparing this protein powder more or less directly to the Cytosport Whey Vanilla Protein commonly found at CostCo. This is simply because the Cytosport bag is what I had used directly before.ON vanilla whey protein has a relatively neutral taste, but is largely unsweetened. This leaves it tasting bland unless combined with something deliberately sweet. Additionally, it tends to clump both in water and milk, which is frustrating to me after using the Cytosport, which dissolved quite nicely in water, at least.In short, it'll do, but it's not the best I've ever used. If you have a use for it (baking, perhaps?) which requires it to not be too sweet, it may be perfect. For the usual shakes and quick mixes, however, I'll be going back to Cytosport, which is cheaper at CostCo anyway."
363277,0,"This pillow was recommended by my chiropractor. It really does work well - definitely keeps your shoulders from scrunching underneath. It's concept makes sense that you could roll to back and either side easily and still have support without having to readjust your pillow. But I share a queen-sized bed and when I roll to my side, I turn in place. If I were to roll the way the pillow was designed for me to roll, I'd need such a wide margin of the bed. The pillow is 25.5"" wide so if you're on your side, where could your arms go comfortably and not invade the other side of the bed? I needed the pillow so bad that I dealt with having to move the pillow to my head's position instead. But I found that I would lay my head in the wrong spot in the middle of the night b/c of the space problem, thus negating the purpose of the pillow. Once my pain was better, I moved onto a Tempurpedic pillow. Now I have this pillow I don't know what to do with."

348730,0,"This leg protector works GREAT when it stays together.The problem I've had it that it's a bit fragile.The first issue was that the gasket at the top broke away from the ring as I pulled it up my leg. This was 2 weeks in.Learning from my first encounter, I got a new one (replacement from Amazon) and within 3 more weeks of putting my fingers inside the smaller hole and pulling it up more gently, the rubber gasket ripped apart.I sent that one back to Amazon and they have since replaced it. It's been 2 more weeks with no issues.So my overall review is that I LIKE this item - it works as advertised - but it breaks easily.Amazon is willing to replace it and since I'm an Amazon Prime member there is no charge for returns, but when it breaks I'm back to the trash bags and duct tape for a few days.In my cast for 3 more weeks. Hoping for no further issues.EDIT: I am still in the cast a month later. 8 days to go. Last week the gasket at the top of my leg protector ripped again.After the 1st 2 incidents I've been very careful to make sure I don't rip it. This time, I slipped it off my leg with no issue and up, over the cast. I hung it up on the shower rod, as I've always done, and while I was drying off I saw it just rip, on its own.Unfortunately I am outside the return window with Amazon and I'm now forced to use a trash bag for the next week.Like I said - it works short-term, but if you're gonna need this for more than a month I would recommend something a little more sturdy."

392938,1,My 2 month old loves this tub! I feel very safe with him in it(of course I attend him at all times while in it) I think the design is overall very good and he seems very content while in it. one of my best baby purchases to date!
382041,0,"I'm faily happy with this product because it's very versatile. The attachments tends to turn after a while and needs to be re-tightened. It has a long reach, which is great feature, but when fully extended, the handle feels kind of flimsy."

231421,0,I tried the watch for two months and it read just fine. By the third month it was not taking readings properly. In the fourth month it did not work at all. I tried to call customer service and you could only leave a message. I sent an email three days ago and still no response. I would think twice about spending the money.

367372,0,It is a closer shave than I am accustomed to but does not catch whiskers that are grown out a bit and seems to struggle at catching the whiskers along the underside of my jaw bone. The top has a tendency to pop off by accident while shaving when I bump the buttons on the side. They simply release too easily dumping whiskers everywhere. I will likely go back to the Norelco if I cannot afford the Bausch when this is worn out.David

With that said, the original battery barely lasted two seasons. Charging it over the winter may help prolong the life. If it lasted as long as the original battery, I would have given this 5 stars."

122541,0,"Tried it, just because I try all the limes.I waffled between ""didn't like it"" and ""it's OK"" for two reasons:As an aftershave, I would have expected a better astringent quality than this provided.Aftershaves generally have a more subtle scent than a cologne...this was a little too subtle."
29275,1,"I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor (red velvet cake) for a gift. And I was sold. I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake, chai, pecan pie and zombie. I love these. They go on so smooth and they're shiny enough that people think I'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box, in just a couple days, and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it. I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose, (I was sick!) not only did it smell great but the next day my nose wasn't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils, which I love. Gonna order more soon. There are 400 flavors, hard to pick just one!"
125747,0,"Comes with a travel bag, adapters, and extra batteries which are always nice. Charger is smart compared to other quick chargers that are timed. Love the feature which allows me to change settings on how I want the batteries to be charged(refresh, charge, discharge, etc).Downsides are the plastic, cheap feel of the charger which I believe could lead to overheating and other similar incidents. Batteries are not 2600 mah as stated but they work. On some batteries that had not been used for a while, please note that there is a minimum charge for the batteries to work on the charger or the charger would read it as ""NULL.""Overall, aside from the cheap, plastic feel of the charger and the misinterpreted batteries; the charger is solid in its own right and so far it is the best charger that I had. If not for the sale price I would not buy this charger, so a 3-star for me."
139020,1,"Okay, first of all, let me say, I LOVE this product. And I am 13 years old. If I can do it, you can do it.I first used this when I was eleven (don't worry I BEGGED my mom to do this, there is no Toddlers and Tiaras stuff going on :)) and I admit, I was pretty scared. But most of my worries were coming from the fact that my mom was doing my eyebrows and not me. The pain is worse if you are not the one inflicting it on yourself :). But there is really nothing to be scared of. Just apply, pull, press, and and remove.The application process is really simple. Just put it in the microwave and warm it up to the desired consistency/temperature and apply it wherever with your popsicle stick thingy. Pull the skin taut in the direction of the way you will be pulling your fabric strip. Then you get your strip of fabric, (continue pulling taut) and press it on. Make sure to wait a couple of seconds so the wax can dry, and embed the hairs in the wax. Count to 3, and remove in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Voila! Smooth, hair-free skin! You may have to do it a couple of times to fully remove the hair but it's worth it.TIP #1: If you are doing this for your first time, make sure to try it out on a smaller area, such as your knuckles, to get used to the application and ""pain"" that may occur.TIP #2: Don't do large areas all at once on your eyebrows. If you're not completely accurate with the wax, who knows what you could pull out?! Do stuff in small portions. I learned this the hard way :/.TIP#3: If this is your first time doing this, make sure to have some soothing lotion (such as noxema) or some aloe vera for your skin. The pain isn't really that bad, but the stinging comes right after and if your skin is new at this, it will be angry. Put the lotion on to top the redness that may occur. I don't recommend waxing the same place more than two or three times due to risk of irritation.TIP#4: Don't heat it up to hot. It burns really bad if you heat it up a lot. Microwave it in like 15 second intervals and have the consistency of warm honey. Be even more careful when applying to your face.All in all, the wax is amazing, and does a really good of getting the hair out. It doesn't hurt, just a little bit more than tweezing since you taking out so many more hairs at once. Happy waxing! :)"
251142,2,"I have purchased this product before and lost about 10 lbs and did have most of the side effects but they were bearable as long as the product worked. I purchased this product again from a different seller (the price was alot cheaper) and started taking it. The caplets appear to only be half full and i'm not sure if they are supposed to be full or not. I am not having ANY of the side effects that I had before and haven't lost a single pound ( I mean, even when i eat really greasy, fatty foods, there is nothing whereas before there was) I'm just not sure if the product is as its supposed to be. Be careful who you order your products from."
348162,0,"What I liked about this product was the fresh taste. This bar was moist and you could really taste the ingredients (peanut butter and chocolate chips.) For me, the bar was very filling just by itself, but for my husband it wasn't as filling. Overall, the bar was of good quality and tasted good. I think that compared to other bars of the same nature, this one would have to be better."

116347,0,"Seemed like a good product, sturdy, attractive and exactly the kind of reading glasses my husband wanted. Unfortunately, they did not fit him even when the ear pieces were adjusted to their maximum length. The magnet on the front would not meet or engage. My husband is a big man so apparently these were just too small for his size. We'll keep looking."

141958,0,"My first experiment with henna was withGodrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, in which I liked the result but not particularly the mess associated with mixing and applying henna. I tried this on a whim because it combined color. I applied it exactly as directed and for the 60 minute time as noted in the insert. When I went to rinse it out the mahogany color went down the drain as well and stained my scalp mahogany. Obviously I am disappointed with the color hold, but the ease of applying the product and the softening effect it left on my 4b natural hair was amazing. For me the color rinsed off my scalp with two shampoos ofKeracare Hydrating Detangling Shampooand a 20 minute conditioning treatment withKeracare Humecto Creme Conditioner. I also remember my hairdresser telling me that some people's hair will not hold color well, I just may be one of those people."

178765,0,"First off, love the scent! Also love the exfoliation I get. However, the word &#34;creme&#34; is not quite accurate... a creme should rub in completely, and this does not. I use it at night, and end up rubbing it into my hands so as not to get &#34;grease&#34; all over my sheets. Would use it more often if it would rub in better!"
380576,0,"I've been using the one I purchased for over 2 months. I'm not impressed. I expected a smoother shave or at least not having to go over the same spot 3 or more times as I normally have to. Unfortunately this razor changed nothing. It doesn't cut better, not faster, not smoother. In the past I've purchased one and two blade disposables and this works pretty much the same only many times more expensive.Maybe if they try six, no eight, no no 12 blades! Yep that's the trick, and make it vibrate 20 times faster, yea ultrasonic!"
211458,0,"This is a quality product and I use it from time to time; however, it just doesn't shave as close as a blade. I frequently find myself ""re-shaving"" with a blade after using this shaver. I'm not sure any electric shaver will shave as close as a blade as long as there is that foil between the blades and your face."

29745,0,"I used the Lasinoh breast pads, which were disposable but since I plan on breastfeeding a while, I felt the expense would add up. These absorb okay but my milk has through through the pad or right out of the pad many times since I am forced to be using them for a stretch of 6 hours. So in terms of absorbancy, Lasinoh has got them beat hands down. Lasinoh also were thinner and stayed in place much better. The only reason I am still using these is because I just put them in the wash every week and don't have to worry about buying a constant supply of breast pads. I imagine I would need to replace some of them but the turnover is much longer."
295707,0,When I first started this product I was like holy cow!!! I had some awesome pumps. I began to up the dose but I never felt the same after the first week using this.. Kinda bummed but it helped to get my vains showing better. I took this with the Nitrix also
295228,0,"I try for about a week, and I don't like that much. If the company makes a tip with smaller opening where it doesn't shoot out that much water (less messy job) and thus will also increase the pressure, I don't mind to invest in the new tip and give it a try again.... That's just give me an idea; I'm going to reduce the opening of the tip with ""crazy glue"" and see how it works."

DMAE is a good supplement for the skin with sags, but taking it internaly is better, and you can go to health stores, buy your own DMAE make your own cream very inexpensive, and add much more DMAE to your cream with much better results"

The pointed end on the mini is rather painful. The knots in my muscle are not very deep because I am a smaller size...if that helps. But, the mini did come as a set with the Jr at the time of purchase so I can't complain(-; A friend of mine said it was a good shoulder scratcher."

She only weighs 120 lbs and is a size 12 in clothes, but these supposedly Large/Extra Large diapers HARDLY COVER HER! How would they cover people with waists up to 48 inches? I never tried Depends before because I figure you get what you pay for. And I was right. These will be useful only in emergencies when no other diaper is available. It is really too bad because the better diapers are twice as expensive. From now on, nothing but the better kind."

192048,0,"This wedge pillow is good for watching tv, or to just sit when you're in bed. But I don't recommend this pillow if you want to sleep with it. It's not very soft, and you can't adjust the height level. However, in my case I do need to use this wedge pillow because I have severe allergies and asthma at night, so it helps not to clog my nose. But it's kinda uncomfortable if you need to switch sides, and I usually wake up at night because of that. It's more comfortable if you sleep with stomach side up, though.But again, I do need to use some kind of elevated pillow and that's why I'm using this one, instead of using to regular pillows which gave me a real neck pain a couple of times... I just wish this pillow was softer, and it'd be perfect if I could adjust the height. But overall, it's a 3 star for not giving me neck pain, and unclogging my nose at night."
301085,2,"Made with fragile plastic connections where the three pieces are screwed together.

127723,0,"BUT--and my review is based on all diffusers and a different fragrance than this one---be careful where you place your diffusers, as these oils often (always?) permanently stain lighter-tinted carpets. If you place them on the floor, keep them out of the way of vacuum cleaner cords, which will knock them right over even if they are in a box-like container, which I learned the hard way, w/ a greenish-tinted, deliciously-fragranced Pier One Apple Oak reed diffuser. Also, I still have that 1/2-filled diffuser (purch. at Xmas), and although I frequently reverse the reeds, I now barely smell it, even close up. Am wondering if the reeds ""wear out,"" or if I am just too used to that wonderful fragrance. Somewhat disappointing."

The one attachment I do use is the adapter that enables use of the Welch Allyn specula. This is nice to have since most of my clinical sites have the Welch Allyn specula. However, the adapter easily comes off with the specula and I have found myself digging in the garbage to retrieve it more than once. If the adapter stayed in place, I would be rating this product much higher. But I am now worried I will lose the one attachment I use daily."
354598,0,"great product but most of the protein content is from soy, so next time I'll be more watchful and I will choose a bar that contains only whey protein."
227343,0,This safe-t-sport neoprene knee support is very good but there are some drawbacks to the support which I found out. The support does what it advertises to do and you have to measure the upper leg above the knee to get the right size. The drawback is not to wear it more than an hour or so as it will make your knee sweat. I also have poor circulation in my leg that I use the support on and in doing so after 3 hours or so my knee will swell. Not life threatening as you have to remove it to feel better.

93814,0,"I read about GABA in a health newsletter by Dr. Julian Whitaker. It is recommended by holistic practitioners for stress, anxiety, and insomnia, especially the kind where you can't turn off your thoughts and are lying in bed worrying and planning for the day ahead. GABA creates calm in the body without chemicals found in prescription drugs.I used GABA for weeks and experienced a wonderful, relaxing effect but, unfortunately, I ultimately developed uncomfortable side effects of racing heart, breathlessness and slight dizziness shortly after rising when I took it at bedtime. These symptoms especially happened when bending over. With much disappointment, I had to stop taking the GABA--especially frustrating because I'd bought two big bottles of it, both theNOW Foods brandand this brand. The holistic doctor I go to said that GABA sometimes has side effects of various types because it works on neurotransmitters. My case is uncommon, though, from what I've read, and if you do not get side effects it is a wonderful neutraceutical.My chiropractor recommendedStandard Process Min-Traninstead, since GABA became a problem for me. Fortunately, I have not had any side effects with Min-Tran, and its calming effects are even more pronounced than GABA's."

213018,0,"The Lobob Optimum WRW drops are pretty watery and not viscous like Boston conditioning solution. While they are gentler on the eyes than the Boston conditioning solution (maybe due to less preservatives), they just don't cushion my RGPs as long. I've used up 2 bottles of WRW so far and this has been my experience. I apply the WRW drops pretty generously after the CDS soaking step, like 3 drops on each side of each lens, but my eyes still feel scratchy and uncomfortable before 4 hours have passed - in which case, I need to apply more WRW drops. On the other hand, the Boston Advance conditioning solution keeps my lenses cushioned and moist for at least 12 hours.In my opinion, the best RGP solution combination is Lobob ESC cleaner and Boston Advance conditioning solution. (Lobob ESC is much stronger and effective than Boston cleaner and you won't need an additional protein enzyme cleaner with it.) The good thing with this combo is that you won't need to spend extra time rinsing off the CDS solution and applying WRW drops in the morning, like you would if you went with the entire Lobob line.I suppose I'll keep WRW drops just in case something gets in my eye while wearing RGP lenses, but now I don't have a need for them."
63927,0,This is an accurate machine. Calibrated well. I checked it against 4 or 5 different machines both manual and automatic and the numbers were good. The only draw back is that you have to stay ABSOLUTELY STILL or you get an error message. You cannot even breathe too hard. But overall it is pretty reliable.
398385,0,"These Trojan Magnum condoms are okay. What I liked best about them was that they fit comfortably. However, I prefer my usual brand, Lifestyles, because the texture of the condom is softer, and therefore, gives me better sensation. The Trojan Magnum had a harder texture. Also, I found the packet hard to open in the dark. I had to turn on the light every time to find the perforated line to open it. Thus, it kind of interfered with the mood. I don't quite feel comfortable recommending condoms to friends, but if we were on the subject and Trojan improved the features I commented on, I'd recommend them to my friends in a roundabout way. I'd especially comment on their comfortable fit."
213579,0,"As long as I was mensturating it seemed to work fairly well. Mainly just being able to sleep better. After reading most of Dr. Lee's book though I found that where he thinks these creams are the answer to life I don't agree. I recommend not taking the large dosage (or even small) that he and others prescribe. That is the tricky part is finding the right dosage.I reached a point in using these creams at a low dosage (smaller than a size of a pea) once every other day off and on for six months, that I was so sleepy I couldn't function and something just didn't feel right. I would roar like a lion in my head, I felt very aggressive and irritable. And like the other post mentioned, I'd get period cramps. When I quit using the cream I felt better...I really think (and doing reasearch) that it can build up in the system fairly quickly.Hormones fluctuate a lot in perimenopause and to say these creams are the answer to it all isn't correct. If you want to check out an interesting site look at askapatient and progesterone. It will show the severe side effects people can get using these creams and also the prog pill is listed in here too."

161484,2,This thing cost 3 bucks at walmart. I went to get some swisspers exfoliating pads (now those things work) and saw this thing for 3 bucks right next to it. I thought it was just another exfoliating thing... didn't know it was for hair removal. But decided to use it anyway as a exfoliater even though I don't have that much hair on my face.I should've kept my 3 bucks and saved me a rash.Dont know if I used the wrong side or not... it never tells you which side to use. Common sense I thought the sticky/adhesive side was the side to stick the pink strip on the purple tool. It didn't look like it was gonna work... all it was was a pink piece of paper with sticky stuff on the back. I rubbed the hell out of a spot right above my lip and then used the rest to exfoliate. And right after I wet my face and dried it with a pad it started burning like crazy and left the brightest red circle right on the spot above my lip where I rubbed it the most. The rest of my face blew up red too and now I'm sitting here with itchy red rashy skin covered in avocado and olive oil. Have no clue what to use to get the redness down so I'm trying anything natural.If you want a rash on your face get this.. if not leave this crap alone.The company should probably be sued for selling a piece of plain pink paper as a 'hair remover' that gives you nothing but a big ass rash.Huge clue.. no ingredients on the box but says its natural..pssh.. natural paper

360477,2,"I'm pretty easygoing and this is actually the first time I've ever returned a product to Amazon based on the product being bad.For 5 years, I've been using a $20 Wahl beard trimmer that continues to do a great job despite plenty of bumps, drops, and travel, but I wanted to trim down the size and weight of my travel toiletry kit and the Remington MB-20 seemed perfect due to being AA-battery operated (the Wahl is cordless but then you have to carry the bulky cord if traveling for more than a few days).I was disappointed the moment the product arrived. First, it was packaged in perhaps the most difficult packaging I've ever encountered -- not even tough scissors would work and I finally resorted to hacking away at it with a utility knife and it still took a long time. Ridiculous, and environmentally unsustainable. But whatever, that's not why I hate this product.Second, the product was not as small as reviews made it sound. In fact, it's slightly larger than my Wahl. The size might have been given in the specs, so I can forgive that, but just know it's not your smallest option on the market.Third, the product design is an ergonomic disaster with a tapered end that feels like it's going to slip out of your hand. In contrast, the Wahl fits my hand nicely. The Remington also felt cheap and plasticky, such that I don't believe it would stand up as well as my current trimmer (although mine cost more).Fourth, and the reason I'm returning it, is that the battery cover will not stay shut, even just while gently handling the device. And it definitely slips right off every time you turn on the ON button. Looking at the design, it couldn't happen any other way, as your hand is on the battery cover grips and directly opposing the action of sliding the lever on. Terrible design. I suspect that the better reviews came from a different batch or version with a tighter fitting battery cover. In time, theirs may start to slip off too, as there is very little holding the cover on, just one little tiny tab of plastic.Fifth, the packaging boasts that the product has a quiet motor, but it sounds the same or slightly louder than my Wahl, and MUCH louder than a Remington haircut clipper I recently purchased (which I love). The sound issue is not a big deal to me, but since they advertise that and it seems exaggerated, I thought I'd mention it, too."
173284,2,Have used this item daily for years as fuel for running and gym work outs. Just received a subscription shipment of bars with the new formula. The taste is terrible -- cloying sweetness with a bad aftertaste. Very disappointed. Will need to look for an alternative.

255658,0,From my experience this product works just fine. It gives a good enough estimate quickly that I feel if you looking for something to calculate your body fat percentage or BMI the Omron HBF-306C is not a bad product. Granted this product isn't perfect and readings do fluctuate this is because calculating body fat percentage is never perfect. This will simply give you a good idea of that number.
219281,1,"These batteries work well and come pre-charged as described. Because they don't lose their charge when not in use as quickly, they can be used in other devices that you normally wouldn't use rechargeable batteries with, like led flashlights and wall clocks. They work great for everything that takes AA batteries. After a few charges you've already saved the purchase price by not using alkalines'."
109464,0,"I think these function similar to carb gels with one exception: you have to chew them. I find that they stick to my teeth (which I hate, no matter what type of food I'm eating). I have only used them prior to a workout, not during. I found that they are fine to use before a workout. However, if I had to chew them while trying to stay on pace during a run I don't think I'd like it (it's too much effort when you are trying to push yourself during a workout). In addition, I think they would be good to use if I were cycling instead of running because I'm able to chew more easily while cycling.In short, I give the Clif Shot Bloks 3 out 5 stars because you have to chew them. I think they taste good but they seem unnecessary given that you can simply buy a carb gel and not worry about chewing anything."
221387,1,"I have tried regular kitchen trash bags, bags with handles, drawstring bags and Hefty Easy Flaps. I like the Easy Flaps best.EASY TO CLOSEThis is their selling point and they win. Twist ties are difficult to use if the bags are very full. They also do not have any handles to grip and carry.Drawstring handles can be too long when they are drawn and the drawstrings do not make an easy to grab handle.Kitchen bags with handles can tie up like Easy Flaps, but they do not have flaps that fold over for complete coverage of the contents when the bags are full.Yes, Easy Flaps close up best, and the knot creates a handle that is firm and easy to hold.LEAKAGEDo Easy Flaps leak? Overall, I find they are suitably strong. I put all sorts of wet things in my garbage bags; and over the years, I remember three occasions when they did leak.FITThe new and improved stretch to fit top does work and I love it. No more need to try and tie the bags down or having them fall into the can. They keep the bags where they need to be hassle-free."

79937,0,"Overall, this lil thing lasted pretty well, and I used it daily for about 2-3 years. It never pulled hairs or left track marks with the guard off lining up sideburns and trimming around my goatee and mustache.It did have one drawback though. While it was easy to use, and frequently zipped through sideburns and goatees with ease, it missed some hairs. With it set to trim hairs over 1/4 inch long, I had one grow to almost 2 inches long before I found it and used scissors to cut it.Something went wrong with the battery, and it died recently. I am not sure if I will buy another or try my luck with another guard system on a fidderent trimmer."
351406,2,"Seriously, if you are going to try a cookie diet you have to use R&D; Diet Cookie. They are WAY cheaper and I think they work and taste better. I suggest you use them to lose your initial 10 to 30 lbs then change the program a little. Instead of the low 800 calories per day, eat a couple for breakfast and maybe even lunch then just make better food choices for the rest of the day. Also, have them for a late night snack. You will still lose weight but it will be a little slower but a lot easier.R&D; Cookie Diet Meal Replacement Cookies - 2 weeks Assorted FlavorsI also wanted to mention I tried all 3 (Hollywood, seigal, smart for life) at one time or another... all tasted OK but still left me a little hungry.

49118,0,"Used this today, wasn't expecting a miracle or anything, but wanted to refresh our carpets for a birthday party we're having in a day.It totally reminds me of something that the employees I worked with in a warehouse that we called Red Dirt, which is a moist sawdust type of floor cleaner that's used primarily in rooms with cement floors, like warehouse shipping/receiving where there's a lot of dust or a lot of the outside dirt gets in. This product as well as the Red Dirt is a moist, grainy type of powder, which when moist is kinda clumpy. It's sprinkled from the bag onto the floors, but with Zorb it goes on carpets only, and then the vacuum is run over it to break it up and mash it into the rug fibers until it dries. The dirt and any residue that is in the carpet is supposed to attach itself to the granules, which then dry and are vacuumed up.Its damp so it states on the package to let it dry for half an hour. I let mine go for nearly an hour and it was just to the point of almost dry but I didn't have more time to wait as we have an indoor cat and I had locked her in the bedroom until it dried throughout the whole experiment.This only works with the Dyson vacuum, or so it says. I have the animal DC25 (which I love, love, love).Vacuumed it up but honestly it didn't really make me go ""I'M A FAN FOREVER"". In fact, I kind of felt like a fool shelling out $13 for this and won't be buying it again. It was kind of one of those things where I made a mess on the floor, only to work to clean it up again LOLI used Zorb on the 8 x 10' low pile carpet in my daughter's room (why I bought a light blue rug for a 3 year old I'll never know) and the brown medium pile carpet in the rest of the house and didn't see a marked difference on either the entire carpet nor the stains that are on it.I have sinus problems and the smell, although pleasant, gave me a headache. Bizarre, considering that the Dyson vacuum made by the company that also makes Zorb is ""proven effective for asthma and allergy sufferers""."

426458,0,"Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.Pros:+Healthy+Unique tasteCons:-Unique tasteOverall three stars.

199424,1,I have been Vegan for approaching two years and recently joined my local gym and have become more active in general. Vega is not a cure-all but it is darn close. I feel much better all around when I have a glass of Vega that day.I have tried the chocolate flavor and vanilla chai flavor.I prefer the chocolate but tastes good as well. They also mix well together. I tend to make a smoothie out of it with some ice cubes and a handful or two of frozen fruit.If you don't need the nutrition to supplement an active lifestyle this is probably too much of a cost to be worth purchasing. For those who do have use for it I highly recommend it.

401185,0,"I've been using unrefined shea butter (mixed with aloe vera gel and some oils) on my hair and skin for a while now - this is not it.People need to understand the industrial difference between organic and natural. Natural means that the product is processed, but nothing artificial is added to it. For all the ladies out there who are concerned about sodium laurel sulfate, a product can still be called natural even if it contains SLS! NOW Foods does specify that they do not use solvents (especially hexanes) in the extraction process and that nothing artificial has been added.I figured by reading the reviews that this is refined, and not 100% pure as they advertise, by the description of it being a nice white color.I bought this because it would have taken too long to get unrefined shea shipped in by the time I left for break. The organic store I went to charged $9.99 for it, which is part of the reason why I'm a bit peeved. But that is the price one pays for convenience.As a skin moisturizer, this is great. If you warm your hands before application and rub really quickly, most of the grit can be melted. This shea glides onto the skin better than unrefined shea. It also sinks in and isn't as heavy. However, I really hate the grit!. And don't use this in your hair while it's damp. No matter how long you rub your hands together, there will still be white grit in your hair. My hair wasn't moisturized as well as had I used the unrefined shea.I would buy this again simply because I wouldn't want to use up my hair shea on my skin. This melts faster, glides more easily and is basically perfect for skin application. As a moisture retainer for hair, it bombed.UPDATE:After a few more uses I will not buy this again. The grit makes the product not worth it for me."

11745,0,This safe-t-sport neoprene knee support is very good but there are some drawbacks to the support which I found out. The support does what it advertises to do and you have to measure the upper leg above the knee to get the right size. The drawback is not to wear it more than an hour or so as it will make your knee sweat. I also have poor circulation in my leg that I use the support on and in doing so after 3 hours or so my knee will swell. Not life threatening as you have to remove it to feel better.
257033,0,"Being German I grew up with the scent of Persil and is is a fabulous product, which works well in conjunction with my Miele front loader. Especially if you want your laundry white without adding bleach. However, charging $ 50.00 is a rip-off that almost leaves me speechless.I have been ordering Persil from Amazon the past ten years, and watched the price slowly but steadily go up from $28.00 to over $40.00. It was understandable, while the exchange rate between Euro and US $ was not favorable for the dollar. Unfortunately the price never went back down again to reflect the most current exchange rates.I just looked on Amazon.de and the same 40load package Persil sells for Euro 12.99 which today equals roughly $18.00..... I would love to continue buying it from Amazon, but I am not willing to pay $50.00 and I wish a few more users would speak up about the unreasonable price increase !"

227717,0,"I have been taking the Symbiotics bovine colostrum for 3 weeks now and find myself still a little ambivalent on the results. Perhaps my expectations were a little inflated by the laundry list of benefits that some people claim, but I have not yet seen such miraculous results. I do, however, intend to continue to at least 60 days or container's end before making a final decision. Perhaps due to the placebo effect, the first three days of use seemed very promising with somewhat more energy and an improved feeling of well being. I was really hoping to build on that and reach an even higher level of health as time went by but that early promise seems to have faded a bit.One unanticipated benefit has been a somewhat decreased appetite which is helping me drop the few pounds I want to lose. Now, whether this is due to the effects of the water I mix the colostrum with (I have heard that drinking plain water before a meal helps reduce the appetite) or the colostrum itself, I'm not quite sure. In any event, I'm a lot less hungry and better able to avoid over eating and snacking while taking the colostrum. I do feel there has been a slight improvement with my allergies, which was one of the major benefits I was expecting, but it certainly hasn't totally eliminated the problem yet.My most recent physical last month found my blood sugar slightly high at 110 and my HGL Cholesterol a little too low so I'm hoping that the colostrum will benefit those symptoms as well. I'd like to arrange some follow-up lab tests after using the colostrum a while longer. I'd feel a lot more confident with the benefits if I saw some verifiable lab results. I do think I'm feeling better off than before I started the colostrum but, as I said, I'm reserving final judgment for a bit longer.Update: After taking the colostrum for 7 weeks, I had my blood sugar and cholesterol rechecked. Blood sugar dropped 5 points, total cholesterol dropped 25 points, triglycerides dropped 4 points,LDL dropped 30 points and HDL went up 6 points. So there has been a measurable improvement, especially with the cholesterol. Whether this is totally due to the colostrum or not is probably debatable but it certainly did no harm and probably contributed to the test results improving to some degree at least. I expect that I will order another container of colostrum and continue it for the time being. I think my original summary of ""Promising, But Not Miraculous"" still stands."

78581,0,"I bought this item a couple of months ago. It has two settings - high and low. I preferred the low setting as it did the job without making too much noise. However, recently the unit started to rattle on the low setting which was louder than the machine so it was very distracting and kept me awake. I don't know what is wrong with it but the higher setting seems to work fine - at the moment. I'm getting used to the higher setting but it is a little louder than I need. I just tried to see if I can return it and the return window expired so it can't be exchanged. I would think there should be a longer warranty on this type of product.Overall, this machine does block out outside noise and it's been a Godsend for me in that regard. I just don't know how long it will be before the higher setting starts to rattle and I will be looking for a replacement."

69156,0,"Combining could be good for some, not so for others. It depends on how 5-HTP is triggered when the individual takes it.SHORT VERSION: In a nut shell, 5-HTP can trigger serotonin or melatonin meaning alertness or sleepiness. You need to know a lot about this product before you take it. Serotonin and melatonin are hormones in our bodies--everyone's body, the first makes you awake and the second makes you sleep. Serotonin is triggered by sunlight and melatonin by the night time/darkness. However some people can have deficiencies anyway. It will be triggered differently in everyone--dosage is different for everyone too.If you're really curious, here's this to read:::PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE TRYING THIS OR IF ITS FAILED FOR YOU BEFORE::I don't think people know that Serotonin is what we need during the day, its naturally enhanced/produced by the sun (its very important to be outside or open your blinds during the day). For some people its good to take HTP in the morning because it gives you a nice boost all day while having a mood-relaxing affect as well.Melatonin is what our bodies start to naturally produce when its dark and make us sleep. These two things are a hormone that is found in *everyone*, just some people have a deficiency. For example, chronic headaches could be a sign of low melatonin and obviously insomnia is too. It may help to ask your doctor to help you decide and find out which is low etc. Everyone's dosage will be different, if you have side effects then it may be you just need a lower dose--your body is trying to get rid of what it doesn't need.Of course, everyone reacts different to certain things but that's the general idea^. Perhaps htp triggers some people's melatonin? There are different Serotonin boosters, you can eventually find one for sleep or energy. (cool tip: Chocolate can enhance serotonin which is why it can make you feel good--which is probably why you crave it when your sad! Besides taste that is. Lol.) Anyway: ""5-HTP is the precursor to serotonin and a trigger for melatonin"" It all depends on who you are and how much you need and how it will be triggered when you take it. You have to really test this product in several ways before you know what's best. If you just want to sleep, I suggest Valerian root and Melatonin--can't go wrong there. There's several other natural sleep aids you can look up.I find Serotonin to be a good enhancement to my overall life, anyone should buy this product but be open to trial and error and eventual success. You will either sleep great OR have a non-jittery energy filled day and/or feel happier.Anyone just google ""can htp trigger melatonin or serotonin"" and/or other variations and be very familiar with things before you start taking them. Just be careful because drug companies may hate them for example and some people may not know what they are talking about, you have to really put a lot of work into these type of things. It's worth it though, I promise!I hope this helps everyone =)"
260555,0,"I like the taste, but noticed that the tea seemed weak. I purchased a three-pack of 24 tea bags and noticed later that the expiration date on the bottom of packages read 4/17 even though I just purchased them a few weeks ago (Aug-Sep 2012). I am almost finished with the second box so I guess it's too late to return them. Amazon needs to be more diligent about checking a product's expiration date before sending it out. I will probably not order this again from Amazon, but will try to contact the company that makes the tea directly."

It's much more effective as a moisturizer, an exfoliant and helping with my break outs."

39367,0,"I was recommended this kind of support by a professional massage therapist. I sit at a desk for at least 8 hrs a day and go to school at night so my neck and shoulders are in moderate to severe discomfort, especially towards the end of the work week.I definitely feel the Underworks posture perfect band working when I wear it. The first time I wore it for more then the initial minute (to figure out the hook placement in the back), it was uncomfortable. My shoulders and my back were fine; the area is the irritated was under your arms. I looked at other posture support bands (shouldersback particularily) but they were significantly more money plus I did not want to get burnt spending that much dough (shouldersback was $50 without shipping) so I tried the cheaper alternative. To overcome the irritation under my arms, I found an old suit jacket that had shoulder pads exposed (the jacket was not lined). I cut the shoulder pads off of that jacket and used safety pins to adhere the shoulder pads around the band. This will work best b/c I can remove the shoulder pads to wash weekly. For the price, definitely worth it. Definitely look into finding shoulder pads before buying this product. I managed to wear the band (without my shoulder pad contraption) for 4 hours over a short sleeve t-shirt that had cap sleeves but would ultimately like to wear under my clothing for the entire work day. The band is discrete and not bulky and even with the shoulder pads I will be able to do so.Not bad for the price.Good Luck"

It is intermittent instead of a steady pulse. I am disappointed in that.

I am so excited and hope over time that I wont have to wax as often, but this is still way better then the facial trimmer. I also really like that you don't use strips with this wax. I use to go to a lady that used this type of wax, but ever since I moved 6 years ago I could not find anyone that used hot wax. I bought a coffee mug warmer instead of the wax warmer because the coffer warmer was 3.99 and it works very good. They are basically the same thing and I saved 15 dollars!"

Now keep in mind I only used it one time and that was my first use of the Braun shaver so I did not get a chance to really test it. The reason I only used it once, and gave it 3 stars, was the it had a really strong smell. No offense to my Grandfather, I loved him, I just don't want to smell like him. You may not mind it but I just don't like strong smelling products. If you don't mind smelling strongly of aftershave I am sure it is a fine product."

It is indeed all that and a bag of chips so to speak.However, I'm sensitive to salicylates and something in this gives me awful respiratory reactions when I spray it. ""Chemically sensitive"" does not mean that every non-toxic, natural thing is OK (I'm allergic to aspirin, so aloe is a problem, etc.)That isn't the fault of the cleaner; the 3 stars is because if you're having it shipped, buying the spray is silly. Much better to buy the 32 oz concentrate. Then you can mix it in a spray bottle at home, and you can use it in different strengths for different tasks.OR, if you're like me, buying the concentrate and not the spray means you can dilute it in a dish and dip the rag in -- no spraying means no inhaling.

To me , since I charge only at home, the expensive little shoulder bag is just a waste of resources and is something I have to get rid of. Such a silly waste. The bag has zippers and clips and velcro and 2 pouches and a side net bag! My goodness. What the heck??- documentation is in 6 to 8 point type! There is absolutely no reason the hefty little manuals (there are 2!) are printed for only the youngest and best-sighted among us. There simply is absolutely NO reason for this.- use is not intuitive. This demands reading the manual(s). As first-time user of this particular device, I was put off a bit even though I have been using NiCD, NiMH and Alkaline recharging devices for years. This is the most complicated device and by far the most expensive. It is also the most complete and best; so the effort seems worth it.WHY? Why not offer the unit w/o all the excess baggage with a manual in 11 point type at a lower price? LaCrosse does, but it costs almost the same and does not come with batteries. Silly."

88903,0,"I bought these to store magazines. I had purchased a cart-full of much nicer boxes at Walmart a while back for less than $10 each. They are really heavy duty and the lid was attached. Every once in a while I find an item like this and was quite pleased. I bought all they had. I quickly filled them up and needed more. As I expected, Walmart did not stock them. They were a one time deal.I have searched and searched for the same boxes and cannot find them anywhere. I ordered some boxes here and eBay just to get total junk. Then I found some similar boxes at another online retailer but they were sooooo expensive and the shipping was ridiculous.I finally ordered these as a last resort. The material is very flimsy. If it were not for the metal corners, you would not even be able to stack them. When I fill the box, it is quite heavy and flexes in all directions.I think if you are just trying to organize light junk, they will work just fine. Anything heavy would surely cause them to fall apart if used regularly. Since my storage needs do not call for regular use, I will keep them and use them to store the 50-60 year old volumes that do not get pulled out that frequently.I will keep looking."

Vanilla really isnt that bad either. I did get sick of the taste where i despised taking it after abouta month. After a short break it didnt bother me anymore. The container says you gain 8lbs of lean mass in 6 weeks compared to 4 from other products. I doubt it works twice as well as other products. 8lbs is a lot for a 6 weeks, we would all look like body builders if this stuff worked that effective for most people.

They may say to get the best hose it can not last long and be a great hose or something but the other brand I have used the hose does not rot out but it does not have enough pressure.I like this brand more than the other products I have tried because it has much higher pressure options.I also like the storage feature on the lid.Looking at the applicator handle it looks like there is no way to connect the replacement hose to the handle so I assume I will have to pay for a handle and a hose when it rots out?I certainly would never buy the models that do not have the replacement hose option,I have three of them and they don't work because of broken hoses!"

I shouldn't have purchased the object based on those lack of measurement descriptions, but when comparing the measurements to other similar items, I felt they were what I had hoped for. Alas, they were not. And since these objects can't be returned even if they are not used, I am out my money. A lesson learned."

He couldn't do it at all. For someone who is heavy or who has larger legs it might work better.

58626,1,My forearm touched the inside edge of a 350 degree oven while I was taking something out (resulted in a 2nd degree burn about 1.5 inches long). I iced it for a couple of minutes and then remembered I'd bought Burn Jel a few weeks ago. I put a bit on the burn and it was AMAZING: the burning sensation was gone - immediate and total relief. I will definitely make sure I have lots of this stuff in the house at all times.

44632,0,"Burt's Bees Beeswax Lip BalmPeppermint, .15ozI love the flavor of this lip balm (very intense peppermint tingle), but it does not hydrate my dry lips. It's very hard, which makes it long lasting & smash resistant, but not as moisturizing as softer lip balms. I recommend getting Dr. Bronner's Peppermint,Lip Balm Organic-Peppermint 0.15 Ounces, instead of this. Bronner's has organic ingredients, more hydration, and is about the same price as Burt's Bees. The peppermint flavor is milder, but if you have dry lips Bronner's is a more effective balm.Ingredients: Beeswax, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Mentha piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Lanolin, Tocopherol, Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Glycine soja (soybean oil), Canola Oil"

420075,0,I liked the product. It seemed like you could use less than a regular shaving cream. It went on very smooth and left my skin soft. The scent was not overpowering either. There really wasn't anything that I disliked about this product.
178963,2,"I purchased this product about a year and a half ago and it was the worst thing I have ever purchased I believe I wasted at least $... in brushes, my family consists of 3 people so I had to buy 2 packs of replacement brushes.First off, the brushes wear down in 2 weeks, noticeably so, I would brush my teeth, eat something and had to brush my teeth right away again. The manual says that they last 3 months. Thats a LIE, don't believe that for one moment. The brush is extremely slow.The stand gets so dirty, you have to constantly clean it, but its very hard to clean.I wouldn't waste my money on this you truly get what you pay for, splurge and get the Oral Braun 3D excel, that is worth every penny. I have that now, and the brushes last a long time I am actually saving money with this brush, GO FIGURE!"
126521,1,"We were very pleased to be able to take advantage of this offer from Amazon to stock up on a product we need to help us care for my aging mother. The individual wipes may be even a bit larger than we actually need, but they are solid, soft, moist (not overly so), and easily dispensed one at a time from the box, which closes up securely when done. It was kind of hit-or miss in picking this for the first time, and we are very pleased with the results. Two-day free shipping with Amazon Prime is icing on the cake."

306261,0,"I like the Oral B electric tooth brush and these heads are very good when they are new. However, and I hope that someone from Braun reads this, the design needs improvement. The smaller of the two brushes separates from the back long before the brush is worn out. If you continue to use the brush it can catch your cheek and be a little painful. This could be a purposeful design as it means you have to replace the brush before it is actually worn out."
166956,2,"No-Xplode is one of many pre-workout supplements I've tried, but unfortunately none of them have been as ineffective as it was. Thankfully, my wife is a HUGE fan of it, so she is going to finish it so my purchase won't be a total waste. However, for whatever reason, it had absolutely no effect on me. I did not feel any energy, I did not have extreme stamina in the gym, and the only real good thing I can say about it is that the Blue Raspberry didn't good...until I got to the bottom of the drink when I had some kind of nasty grainy tasting stuff. My favorite pre-workout supplement would have to be Gaspari's SuperPump Max, which I discovered after spending hours on forums trying to find something that had the least negative feedback. It seems to give real energy without the caffeine jitters, and I last a lot longer at the gym. For those who like No-Xplode, its suppose to be awesome. However, all the people I know that say it's great are female, so it might have to do with getting the right dosage for body size. I'm just not willing to use a product that's suppose to last 30 days and drink it up in 10 days instead."

141279,1,"My husband has been an ardent fan of the Aveeno shaving gel for the past decade and the reason is because it is the only shaving gel [he swears by this] that prevents shaving bumps, due to the oatmeal ingredient. Also, it is really gentle on his sensitive skin. He actually makes me buy him this shaving gel in bulk when I go to the grocery store in case he ever runs out, so its definitely a winner!"
336043,0,"I had my husband use Shotgun and give me his opinion on it since caffeine triggers migraines with me. He liked the product but found the grape bubblegum flavor odd, but not entirely unpalatable. While he's not a fan of caffeine either, he was able to tolerate Shotgun without ill effects.What I did like was during the short time he used Shotgun, I did notice some good muscle results on him I had not otherwise seen before. We workout off and on and he usually can drop weight quickly, but muscles are hard to build on him. Shotgun, I feel, actually gave him somewhat better results than not. It was an unexpected but welcome surprise.Shotgun seems to be a decent product and worth trying if you can get past the unusual but not too bad grape bubblegum flavor. As with any these kind of products, your results may vary."
330019,0,I shaved with the Atra for years until the cartridges became too expensive. $1.25 or so each was just too much. So I dug out my granddad's 1956 DE (double edge) Gillette Super Speed and found blades for about .15-25 cents each. I got a better shave once I got the hang of it. That was 15 months ago and I have not looked back. Most any multi-blade razor will cause ingrown hairs; not the DE's!
90183,2,I order two Powersonic PS-12180NB batteries sold by eComElectronics on Amazon. What they sent me were two ub12180 from another manufacturer (which can be bought cheaper on eBay). The batteries charged and seemed to be working fine but after the first charge neither battery would charge in the device I bought it for nor would they charge out of the device on a battery charger. I notified eComElectronics and they did not respond. Complete waste of money and not even the product advertised.
339460,0,Ok well weve tried plenty of teething helpers and this was alright. i dont really know if it last longer then the regular formula. But i dont think it does in my opinion
379055,0,"We received this kit as a shower gift for our now 11-month-old son. I would recommend buying higher quality items separately. My fave item is the clipper - the handle makes the whole process a lot easier. We haven't used the medicine spoon yet but our pharmacy gives those away. This one looks like it will work fine, though. The nose aspirator is absolutely useless in my opinion. I have tried to use it with no results - we use the big blue one we received at the hospital. We used the thermometer under the arm and it takes a pretty long time to get a reading. I purchased a fast speed model from The First Years for under $10 that works great.At first I thought the medicine dropper was great but after using it a week, it just seemed to lose it's suction. It was more and more difficut to suck the medicine out of the bottle and likewise give it to my son quickly. The one nice thing is the lid, you can pre-measure medicine for later. My son had a terrible bout with an ear infection that just wouldn't go away until we used several anti-biotics, so we have much experience with these care items. When dealing with a squirming, sick baby, you want these items to work well and quickly. If I could go back to last year at this time when I was still pregnant, I would spend a little bit more to buy a better version of each item."

184313,1,"Yes, you can put together a much better med kit yourself.

You might just do that instead, and get your own burn cream and Neosporin here on amazon for much cheaper overall."
289315,0,"The kushies I have tried seem have their ups and downs. They are reasonably trim and you can get a good fit with them because of the velcro-like closures, but I have found that after weeks of use and washes, the velcro closures gather threads and lint and make them hold less and less tightly. This would make a larger child or aspiring nudist tempted to remove his/her diaper. (You'll know if you have one of these kinds of kids, lol). They have elstic in the legs and waist which helps with breast fed infants, but the elastic seems to loose some softness after use. I think these diapers are okay for the daytime, but can definitly leak at night or for going out. My toddler can pee right through them though, so maybe more than jsut flannel is needed on the inside. The 5 layers of flannel plus absorbent inner makes them take a long time to dry, but for the money you can afford to have a bunch of them and just change you baby all the time (which is good for them anyway.) I think they are an okay value. Definitly better than flat diapers!"
115670,0,"I gave it a 3 star because of how thick they are. Its really cool that they glow but the pleasure for guy and girl isn't very good. I really don't care to use them again because of that. Glowing condoms are awesome but it's not worth using them again..I say if you want to try them out get like a 3 pack. I think everyone is so impressed with the fact they glow. Some women/men pick pleasure over ""special effects"". I'm one of them."
207547,2,"I bought this gum for my Mom last year. She had uterine cancer. She said it helped a little bit with the nausea but she could only chew for a few minutes and then she spit out. She had dentures. I never thought about that so I wanted to just warn everyone if you are buying this for an elderly person and they have dentures don't. Also, if they have advanced cancer like my mother did, I don't think any gum will help that much. I think you'd be better off buying some ginger cookies or ginger candy or even fresh ginger for them to nibble on or steep in tea."
218756,0,I was not happy at all with this purchase I order this bottle of After shave. When I received it the bottle had been open half was gone. The mailman put a bag around it and a rubberband to hold it together. I would of sent it back but it was too time consuming and the cost was not worth it. I will not be ordering from this company again... Let me say it's not the product it's the way is was package very poorly
355587,0,Got the poster in the mail had some wrinkles down the middle. Went to get the product lamenated and the wrinkles didn't come out. Disappointed due to the fact that the wrinkles where in the middle of the poster which means they where handled poorly at the warehouse and whoever shipped it could care less about the product they're selling.
46518,0,"This latest generation, as another reviewer commented, is the shortest and thinnest yet. Having the surface already impregnated with aloe and vitamin E means, to me, less absorbency. The edges are not as finished and feel rougher and sharper on my skin. They don't stick as well, either. But, beggars can't be choosers; there are almost no unscented liners out there, so this is what we have to use... right? I found some of the old boxes, so I will prolong the inevitable as long as I can. Someone told me about a new organic brand that is supposed to be good (and actually work), I am looking into those, as well."

52594,0,"I have back pains, lower abdomen pressure (since I'm carrying my baby low) and the vulvar pressure; mainly after being on my feet for awhile. So far this contraption isn't what I'd hoped. Perhaps its too big and not holding me well enough yet. I did purchase it with room to grow in mind, but its not loose; yet I feel more comfort from the V2 pull up and a belly belt. The cradle plus is NOT something to wear if you are wearing anything other than a scoop necked shirt and its a hassle to get in and out of for the frequent restroom visits, (especially while out and about, which is when I need it most). I am 6mos and have gained 33lbs already, so though I am trying to slow it down big time, I have hope that one day this will be the support it appeared to be when I purchased it. Definitely not there yet. Not adjustable (except the straps around the behind, and I don't need to switch that, but it'd be nice to get a better lift in the front based on comfort and support need."

No need for those silly diaper covers, our Happy Heiny's are cute without one!"
192547,0,"I've used this one for awhile with good results. However, I may replace it because I noticed that crevices on the inside of the pot tend to grow mold or mildew. For example, there are indents on the inside of the pot where the handle is attached. This appears to be due to the ceramic manufacturing process. Also, mold tends to appear on the inside of the spout. It is a good idea to sterilize it frequently. Otherwise, it works well."
253625,0,I heard of Elderberry juice from a Dr. Oz show so I searched on amazon for one to try. It seems a bit expensive. I got it for both my daughter and myself especially for the flu season.

394256,0,"I thought this would be a great idea for our baby. The bath seat makes it difficult to clean the baby. You have to remove her from the seat to wash her. And, the arm rest doesn't fit well around our tub. She is also not able to bend over and reach her toys when she's in the seat. She used to love being in the tub, now she is not able to splash as much with the seat. We only used it for about 2 months. I would recommend the Safer Cushion (you can buy it at BRU). It gives her the freedom to play and it is much easier to wash her."

410138,0,"UPDATE: check for different sellers here on Amazon. I was able to find a seller (think it was Amazon) that didn't charge for shipping.

I trust the brand and Dr Weil's efforts to promote personal health. See the other reviews for the technical details.My concern is that I now have to pay for shipping. What happened? I just placed an order for other Weil vitamins and shipping was free. My last order of this multivitamin also had free shipping. (Thank you, Amazon, for keeping this history).Now, why is shipping nearly $7 for this bottle? Yes, I agree with other reviewers the pills are hard to swallow. But this shipping cost is even harder to swallow especially since other Weil products have free shipping.I may yet purchase because locally these same vitamins are twice as much. 180 count is nearly $50 locally.The value of any product is not just the product itself but also the cost to obtain it."
390858,0,"It does the job, but I find it to be just a little too large. While lathering up I find myself either hitting my fingers or the handle of this brush on the side of my shaving mug. The bristles, I find, are also too wide. This wouldn't be a problem if i could get the lather all the way to the edge of the bristles, but I can only get it on the center. This means that when I'm applying it to my face, I am tickling my ears with the outside bristles. All that said, it is a great looking brush with a great capacity for creating a quick lather. It also fits well in your hand."

10671,0,"Overall, this was a good bathtub for us and served its purpose until our daughter was a little over 7 months old and outgrew it. HOWEVER ... I want to warn everyone interested in this tub that the ducky begins to take on that ""wet-sponge"" smell very quickly in spite of regular machine washings and hanging it to dry immediately after bathing (at least ours did). The tub without the ducky is pretty slippery, so I would recommend buying a non-slip mat to put in the tub instead of the ducky. You can always use the non-slip mat again when your baby transitions to the big tub."
131675,0,"I had never had a yeast infection up until a few days ago when I started taking an antibiotic for being sick. It was not too bad of an infection but the combination of heat and sweat made it start to itch a great deal and monistat 1 was recommended to me by a friend. I used it at 3am when I couldn't take the itching anymore! it seemed to provide some relief throughout the night. By 9am I was itching like crazy!!!! it burned so bad and made going to the bathroom an almost unbearable experience. (not a uti, the pain was from the pee hitting the lower parts of my crotch) I went out and bought some yogurt and cranberry juice about an hour later and took a nap. Now (14 hours later) it actually feels pretty good. It hurts a tiny bit but I can handle it and it doesn't itch. So far I have no mess from it either. I saw a tiny bit of the monistat come out but not too much. Aside from the really itchy beginning part it's not too bad. I would definitely say if you are going to use monistat 1 that you should eat yogurt and drink cranberry juice along with it because it definitely helps the process along. I feel a lot better now..more so than I thought I would after reading all the reviews!"
321293,1,"I have very bad seasonal allergies that hit me every spring and every fall around Memorial Day and Labor Day. This spring, I heard about Quercetin and thought it was worth trying. What a difference this spring has been for me. While all of my fellow allergy sufferers have been miserable, I've been having the best spring allergy season since I can remember. I take two of these with breakfast and two with supper along with a single loratadine (claritin) daily. I'm not brave enough to give up the loratadine just yet, but I haven't had to break out the loratadine plus decongestant at all this spring. Normally I'm loaded up on generic claritin-d and still suffering symptoms while being in a constant decongestant fog. I'm even able to enjoy outdoor activities like bike rides with my kids. For me this has been a huge breakthrough in treating my allergy symptoms. This fall I'm going to try to go without the claritin by starting early on the quercetin and staying ahead of my symptoms."

404640,2,"Art of Shaving Pre-shave oil works fine but is very very oily... I'm not a fan... One could use olive oil or something similar and the result would be the same. Art of Shaving Soap and Post Shave Balm on the other hand are excellent, however the Pre-shave is sub-standard to other products. Once you apply the Pre-shave oil, your hands and face are coated in oil which is tough to remove even with soap.As an alternative, I use the Kiehl's Pre-Shave which allows the face to be slick but not oily so that your shave is smooth. I should note, that Kiehl's shave cream is very much lacking compared to Art of Shaving."
246219,0,"I'd prefer not to use products from companies that do animal testing. I've used the Rainbow henna in red, but I was suspicious as to whether it was real henna since it didn't stain my hands at all and it only called for leaving it on my hair an hour, which high quality henna I've used stained my hands terribly and took hours on my head to take. I'm not complaining on the price, though. It did leave a reddish stain, but lightened my hair a bit. I'd like to try the blonde to see if it lightens even more, but again, I'm wondering what other dyes or ingredients are added to this product as it doesn't seem like real henna to me. I'm also wondering about animal testing esp. since this henna does not seem 100% natural as it claims."

I supplemented one 10mg tablet once a day for about 3 weeks.During week two, I was working out with a friend when something strange happened. We were doing an advanced plyometric exercise: weighted jump squats, and during which I really pushed myself to my physical limit. At the end of the set I was feeling dizzy and my head was throbbing. I cut the workout short and went home to sleep. Over the following week every time I worked out my head would throb uncontrollably. By the time week four rolled around even running up a flight of stairs would leave me with such a severe throbbing headache that all I could physically do was lie on the ground until it would go way.I stopped taking vinpocetine and my headaches went away within two days. I have since been able to increase the intensity of my workout to a level much higher than when I was taking it. I have not had an exertional headache of that nature since then.During the few weeks that I was taking vinpocetine, I did notice a slight increase in my ability memorize things. (Mostly useless things, as I've said before I'm in college) However, in this case the cure is worse than the disease, and I would much rather live headache-free than be able to remember more."

213412,0,"I got this progesterone to improve my PMS symptoms. I was a demon before my period. And I admit that I bought this product on the assumption that I'll just use the product according to directions and become a happier woman. But you really have to do your research. Not scaling it to the appropriate amount for YOUR body can leave you feeling no better and possibly worse off than before. Synthetic or bioidentical progesterone will build up in your fat and takes months for it to clear out. I used the recommended amount for 2 weeks and figured it worked pretty good. Then the next month I didn't feel any better when I started it up again. Now I don't use it at all. Better sleep and better eating improved my mood exponentially. Common sense stuff, but hey, you live and you learn. I'm not saying don't use this stuff, just be cautious about how much you use and how often and think about changing up your habits."
210875,0,I have used epilady products since they first came out ... I have not shaved my legs in over 20 years. This particular epilator causes minimal discomfort but is also not very effective in hair removal. I have to spend much more time than I used to with the previous models.
372818,0,"the product was not in the original packaging as in the image. It was in a clear unmarked plastic package. When i pointed this out, a replacement was cheerfully delivered, but alas in the same condition. Was never sure this was factory original, but seemed to work fine."

89203,2,"I bought these scales at Target because I figured digital scales would be pretty accurate, they had the Body Fat Analyzer, and they were on-sale for around $20, IIRC (I've had them for a few years now).I've long suspected the scales were not entirely accurate, because I could weigh myself two times in a row, once with a 16 oz (or 1 lb) bottle of water, and once without, and my weight would not change.I'm taking part in a weight-loss competition at work so I've been working out pretty actively the past few weeks, lost 15 pounds, and apparently my Body Fat has gone from 22% to 20%. Yesterday I had a pretty big lunch and dinner, and it's still in my system, and when I weighed myself this morning the scales showed I had gained 3 lbs. Understandable. But then they said my Body Fat was back up to 22%.Oh really?I grabbed my two 10 lb dumbbells and jumped back on the scales. They showed an accurate 20 lb increase in weight, but now they said my Body Fat was at 27%.Really? Are you sure? Because my weight may have gone up but I'm pretty darn sure those 20 lbs are not fat. If anything, based on a ratio of actual body fat (if measured by bio-impedance as claimed) to total weight, my BF% should have gone down, but these scales claimed it went up. Clearly they do not measure your Body Fat via bio-impedance as they claim, or if they do the equation they use attributes too much to total body weight. I cannot even be sure of their reliability and accuracy as scales alone.Stay away from this product, and maybe even this manufacturer. In my experience they do not make reliable, accurate products."

80474,2,"The shipped product is not the same as pictured in the Amazon advertisement. The cans shipped not only are an older model with inferior spray heads but one can is dented and two cans plastic caps (covers) were broken with a spray head bent. This shipment is unacceptable. If I wanted the older model with small spray heads I would have bought them local. I want to return the shipment at your costs and receive a full refund or preferably you express ship at your costs the correct new model as pictured on the Amazon web site, picture of the new improved spray head as advertised is attached."
317123,0,"While my son loves the fact that the wipes are warm when I use them, the stupid lid to the warmer won't stay shut. It is constantly drying out the wipes that are in there and I have to constantly go back and shut the lid. I've even tried putting something on top of the warmer, but that just makes it more difficult for me when I go to change a diaper. I would recommend this warmer if you have plenty of extra time throughout your day to make sure the dang lid stays shut! Also, if you have a money tree you can go pick money off of to replace all the dried up wipes then this is the product for you. Yes, I have been replacing the replacement pillow so it isn't that. Just frustrates me to spend so much money on something that doesn't work properly."
39573,0,"It was very lathery and rich-feeling, but I didn't feel that it lived up to its moisturizing claims after use. It did provide a smooth shave. The scent was very refreshing and light. However, I feel that there are equal or better products available right now. I wouldn't buy this product, nor recommend it to my friends or family over other products already available for sale."
193249,0,"Ordered Friday night, received Tuesday AM...I was impressed.Thanks to Affordable Med and FedEx for the quick delivery.Table was easy to assemble and functions as advertised.Like some others, I didn't like all the little foam pieces they packed around the table. They were a pain to wipe off and they get everywhere.I might end up attaching some kind of decorative angle iron to the front edge, so stuff won't slide off too easy when the table is tilted.Still, we like the table. It adjusts easy, rolls easy, looks OK and from what I've seen it is priced right.Cheers,Rich"
23376,0,The Diabeti Derm Foot Rejuvenating Cream is good it does keep the bottom of the feet smooth and free of cracking skin. You will notice some dry skin scaling which is not a problem. All in all I feel this is being offered at a fair price.
