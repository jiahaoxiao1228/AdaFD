48487,0,"Great device, great look, but quality image is not that good. The center image on parent unit is brighter than the corners, which may difficult details visibility. Sound part works fine, leds vu bar graph is nice. Range area worked fine for me (an area about 300 feet)."
104068,1,"It fit perfectly on the night stand, and the colours are great. My daughter loves it, especially the kitty"
158040,1,"Whe bought this while our son was in the NICU, before we found out he would be coming home with an Apnea monitor and PulseOx. I went ahead and turned this monitor on while he was in the crib and I was amazed how well it actually worked. After playing with the sensitivity for a few minutes the Bebe Sounds monitor would tic each time he took a breath. I was able to correlate the tics to the breathing based on the Apnea monitor. The Bebe Sounds monitor matched it perfectly. Although we have really never needed it for my son, I am comfortable enough with the Bebe Sounds that I have used it occasionaly when I have not wanted to wake my son up by putting him on the apnea monitor. I am sufficently impressed enough with it to highly reccomended to anyone looking for a monitor. This is really a great product and I would expect that it would help ease the fears of paranoid parents (of which I am one)."
136649,1,"I don't typically write reviews...but wanted to share my experiences with LeapFrog's Dreamscapes Soother. Our daughter just turned 2 in November. I purchased the product when she was an infant. When she moved from the crib to a twin bed (when she was about 20 months old), I attached bed side rails. I knew I had to find a way to attach the soother to the rails, because she uses it EVERY night. It's her bedtime ritual and she presses it over and over again until she finally falls asleep. Not only does it have soothing music (which I've never grown tired of), but it acts as a night light while she's still awake (while the pictures are scrolling). I don't know what we would have done without it. We have several LeapFrog items, including LittleTouch LeapPad, Discovery Ball, LeapStart Learning Table, Learning Drum and FridgePhonics (which we've had since she was 12 months old, and she can almost recite the entire alphabet). Regardless of the fact that I have to purchase batteries every 4-6 weeks (approximately), WE LOVE the DREAMSCAPES SOOTHER and highly recommend it!"
44116,0,This would not fit properly on my faucet and seemed like it would've fallen off with water pressure even if it had fit. The upside was that when I called BOON customer service they were nice as can be and were very accomodating and agreed to replace it with any other Boon product I would like (within close value).
26199,1,"Lightweight, easy to fold plus it stands on its own when folded. Which comes in handy when I am alone w/ my daughter. I also love that it has a tray that my lil one uses as a foot rest. Smoothest ride in town. One con is that the stroller shade isn't big at all not enough sun shade, so I brought a sun shade."
28969,0,"We ordered it in cherry finish, and it is a true cherry color. However, the material used for the cushions is a hard, scratchy, industrial-type dark beige fabric with a burlap feel; definitely not something I would pick out for a nursery. It looks soft and comfortable in the picture, but we don't find that to be the case. I will have to recover it in order to match the ivory color in our nursery.Overall, it is okay, but in retrospect, I would probably spend the extra money for a different brand."
145908,0,"We bought this jumper for our son when he was 4 months old. He is now almost 1 year and has yet to like this bouncer. The music is annoyingand the toys are really cheap. I would recommend our Exersaucer, butthis toy takes up too much room and does not keep his attention."
182236,0,"Cute idea -- little book is the perfect size to motivate baby to sit on the potty. It has a good sized splash guard and support for the back. Mine came cosmetically defective (picture on the front is incomplete), but the hassle of sending it back wasn't worth it. Not very easy to empty out -- I like another one I bought with a removable potty part better for this reason. Ok as an alternative potty in the 2nd bath on a different floor."
116823,0,We've had this bag for about a month and it does keep the liquid in but the inner plastic is peeling off. We wash it with our cloth diapers a few times a week but we've had others for longer that have not begun to peel.
15225,1,My brother recieved it and so far so good!!! He's happy with it. I know people who use this product and I like it tons.
101360,1,"I have searched for bedding sets that were pretty and girly, but not an eyesore, or covered in obnoxious colors or crazy amounts of characters. This fits the bill. It is true that it is not shiny in person there is a bit of sheen in the fabric that makes it come across as satin in the photo, but the pattern is beautiful and the accessories are lovely. It's nice to have something not in PEPTO BISMAL PINK, but a lovely pale pink. It's more soothing and has pretty sage green and lavender butterflies so you can add some of those colors in the room as well."
69489,0,"Pampers are by far the best diapers that we have used and are certainly worth 5 stars. The reason I gave them only 3 is because of the price. I can get them at Babies R Us or BJ's Wholesale Club for the exact same price. Why would I pay the additional price of the shipping and buy them from Amazon. I have come to expect the best prices from Amazon, however that is not the case in this situation. I am truly disappointed that Amazon does not have a better price."
86985,1,"I really wanted to love the drop-in bottle system. I purchased eight bottles, several boxes of liners, and two breast milk storage kits prior to the birth of my son thinking it would be so convenient to just pump breast milk into the liners and freeze them. Unfortunately, mother nature didn't cooperate with my plans and I was unable to breastfeed. I figured they would still be good bottles even if my son was formula fed because you don't have to scrub them and they should cut down on gas. This was a good theory, but in practice I have found that I tend to wash these just as often and just as thoroughly as I would a traditional bottle, so it really doesn't save me any time. Plus, to me, it seems almost messier to deal with disposing of the liner (especially if there is leftover formula) than if you just poured the extra down the sink from a traditional bottle. I have found the liners to be costly and kind of a nuisance to keep up with (one more thing to remember when traveling with baby). And now that my son is taking four ounces at a time, I have found that it is just about impossible to fit four ounces of water plus formula in this bottle without making a mess. It also bugs me that I can't use these with my bottle warmer (they melt...oops!) and the nipples do not fit well in my dishwasher basket. These are small things, but when you deal with them several times a day it can get annoying.What does my 5 week old son think of these bottles? Well, this was the first nipple he was ever introduced to, and he seemed to like it at first. But in the past two weeks he has been acting like he doesn't want to latch on to it as well. He actually preferred the narrower, ""firmer"" nipple on the Similac nurser bottle. With the Playtex drop-ins nursers he eats very slowly and seems to lose interest halfway through a feeding. Also, I can't tell that they really prevent gas all that much. He has a lot of trouble with spitting up. For this reason we finally decided to switch bottles. He now uses the Dr. Brown's Natural Flow bottles and is doing MUCH better....feedings are much easier and quicker and there is a lot less spit-up mess to deal with afterwards.I know every baby is different and I can see where these bottles would be great for a breast-fed baby. Mom can pump directly into the liners and the nipples seem to be designed to mimic breastfeeding. I will be saving my bottles, and hopefully I can breast-feed my next child so they will be used. However, for my formula fed baby, they did not work as well as the Dr. Brown's."
37717,1,Luvs wipes are simply the best. They clean without leaving a weird film and they smell great too! They are definitely worth more to me than what they ask for.
18363,1,"Baby loves it -- bright colors, great interaction! Highly Recommend! Price is comparable to stores...a bit better if you get the free shipping!"
92723,1,This s exactly what I was looking for. It hangs perfectly along the side of the crib. Nice rich brown color that goes with everything.
103848,1,This monitor is definitely worth the money. We have been using it with our newborn for about a month now and love the results. There is no static interference so you can hear your baby crystal clear. We also have digital cordless phones and wireless internet that do not interfere with the signal at all. Synching the base with the peripheral monitors is simple and explained well in the manual. Range has not been an issue as we can be anywhere in our 4 level loft as well as outside with no signal interruptions. Have not used the nighlight or lullabyes yet but am excited to try them out. Overall I have nothing negative to say about this monitor at all.
29383,1,Years ago a Vet recommended Caldesene for our loose skinned floppy Bassets. We used it on subsequent Bassets until we could no longer find it.and have tried other products which did not work quite as well. I was thrilled to find it online - like finding a long lost friend.
109779,1,"My son is a very restless sleeper. I was very nervous about putting him into his big boy bed. After a couple of nights of seeing him move all over the bed with the rail in place I have no more fears. He kicks it, rests against it, shakes it, and pushes on it. It has stayed stable and tight to the bed. I love this product."
13918,1,"I tried both these and the playtex ventair bottles. My son definitely showed a strong preference to the nipple on this bottle. I like the shape and think they are easier to hold and the wide mouth is great for mixing formula.We too originally had problems with leaking. After re-reading the directions I now make sure I hear the nipple ""click"" into place, and make sure I don't over-tighten and haven't had any problems with leaking since doing so."
181349,1,"My son started using this product from the time he was 3 months old. It's a good mat for tummy time and he loves the crinkling leaf and other toys. However, it does not fold for storage so it does take up a lot of space. I have read that other similar, though more expensive gyms, do fold up. - Noga Delshad"
159799,1,"I registered for this bouncer for playtime, as the swing would be for sleeping... It has proven to be a DREAM!PROs- It is easy to take around the house, WHILE baby is in it! I could do anything while he was eye-level on a flat surface and in the Kick n play!- Very colorful, yet the lights dont go too fast, and the music has various settings- Very lightweight, and easy to push out of the way- You can have baby kick activate the toys, or have to music just play through- Seat cover is easy to remove, wash, and put back on- Theres a saftey belt for the baby- The vibrations are soothing for a fussy baby, and without the toybar a VERY sleepy baby would rest- The toy bar is easy to remove with one hand so you can place your baby in safelyCONs- The bouncer cannot fold, so its a bit tedious while traveling- I wish that FisherPrice sold interchangeble toys to go on the bar- It would be great if it included a few recline settings, and if it could have softer music for nap timeAll in all I highly reccomend the bouncer, as our swing was too bulky to move throughout the house. Even my 18 month old sits on it, and it doesnt give way. My baby is starting to loose interest, as he is more excitable while in his Jumperoo, but I suppose that is something everyone deals with!"
68585,1,"Bought this for a first time Mom, I used Moses baskets for all my children, its beautiful, well made and the new Mom loves it and uses all the time ."
66065,1,"I bought these on a recommendation from a Nurse in a child birthing class my husband and I went to. I am so happy we have them! It does exactly what it says... at least in my experience it does. My daughter burps easily, and sometimes not at all (without any negative effects)... her spit up is minimized by the bottles and she does have colic. So, anything that reduces the bubbles in her digestive tract are good in my book.I would recommend these to anyone looking to buy bottles for their newborn. My daughter was small for her age, and at 6 weeks old we are still getting use out of them at 4oz. :)"
174881,1,"This is a decent organic option and a good value for the price, especially for those of us who strive to live green and organically, but do not have exorbitant budgets on which to make it a reality in our homes!As some reviewers state, this pad is not 100% organic through and through and, indeed, there is some questionable marketing going on with this product. And while, as these negative reviewers state, there are other totally organic mattress pads available on line (which I would love to have if I could afford them), again, the reality of buying on line and paying all those shipping charges gets to be pretty expensive, especially when combined with the costs of organic food, organic baby products, cloth diapering, etc. So from the perspective where cost meets availability meets safety... here is my take on it:I live in NE Ohio where our local organic options are limited and buying everything on line adds up to big bucks and lots of shipping charges. The Priva mattress pad is readily available at the big name baby/children's store for about 1/4 the price of the totally organic pads available on line. And the part of the pad that my child comes in direct contact with is 100% organic. I can live with this!It is a very comfy mattress pad - quilted, soft, breathable, thick and squishy. My son, in particular, has always sweated a lot during the summer months on other mattress pads and ""waterproof"" barrier sheets (even the ones that were 100% cotton flannel topped and/or supposed to be breathable). But I have noticed enormous improvement since he started sleeping on this mattress pad... there has been no more sweating or waking up wringing wet.Some reviewers also complain of this pad shrinking or it being too tight to put on their mattress. I have purchased four of these so far over the past four years - two in the portacrib size and two in the full crib/toddler bed size - and have had no problems with them shrinking excessively or not fitting our mattresses. Wash in cold water. Line dry. You'll be fine.No it is not truly 100% organic. But for the price and convenience of local availability, combined with a reasonable amount of organic safety, in my opinion, you can't beat this Priva mattress pad!"
177978,1,"Yes, this is ridiculously overpriced, but my daughter LOVES it. The quality is great. It is bright and cheerful. It folds easily for storage and you can turn the music off easily. Did I mention that my daughter loves it?!!"
147866,1,"Loved it in the baby's nursery. For baby clothes, it's big enough that I think it could hold an entire wardrobe. Will be a great option as the baby grows up. Seems very sturdy, but is light and easy to pick up and carry the whole thing to the washing machine."
153339,1,"Boudreaux's Butt Paste is not only good for diaper rash~I use it too! I have very sensitive skin and break out so bad in the cold months with eczema that my skin cracks and hurts so bad.I put some on my arms and it helped so much~the rash is almost gone.Many hikers, bikers, joggers, cyclists, hunters, truckers, and athletes also use the product because it provides a protective barrier against wetness, helps relieve chapped or cracked skin, and helps protect from the drying effects of wind and cold weather."
179080,1,Sure all babies get gas sometimes but this bottle is great. It definatley cuts down on the amount of gas our daughter has. We did have to go straight to the 2 stage nipple due to the flow. The bottles at the hospital were a lot faster than the stage 1. But due to other reviews we switched and there has never been a problem. I definatley recomend these bottles.
95768,1,I Bought a used boppy and it was bright red. I wanted a muted color. I bought this cover and it works nicely. The red doesn't show through. We'll see how baby likes it when he gets here.
7013,1,I have read quite a few of the reviews and was surprised to see the complaints about shipping time. I live in upstate NY and have ordered these twice and got them in 2 to 4 days both times. I figure why carry them home from the store and pay tax on them when I can have them shipped to my door so easily.
172404,1,This is a great tub seat. The attachement to the tub is a great idea because it makes the tub seat very stable. I had a son 9 years ago and although the tub seat with the suction cups worked for us you can clearly see why a baby would drown (including non- fatal drownings) in those types of seat even with supervision. Suction cups never work well. They always wear out. This is a wonderful alternative to a baby tub. I only have one problem and that is that it is large. Very hard to store. If you have a problem with space then I would find another alternative.
181049,1,"received on a time, safe, well packed and everything was according to our expectations. for sure will do business next time.thanx a lot"
141287,1,My grandson wants to walk and I can see him using this to start training his legs. He also likes to bang on things so I got him a set of wooden spoons to use with this toy. I can't to hear him beating on this toy.
172466,1,"This seat is great for my 9 month-old who LOVES bath-time. I don't see why the manufacturer says to only use a little bit of water. I fill the tub up until the water reaches the bottom edge of the backrest on the seat. He can splash this way, making bath-time funner for him, and easier for me! The only 3 things I have to complain about is 1. the seat swivel lock comes out of place alot, which causes him to swivel to not facing me, 2. I wish there was a strap to keep him from standing up. A simple strap with a buckle-lock would be great. He always stands up and has almost fallen forward into the water many times, and 3. Water always collects in the seat under the leg secure. I turn it up-side down and also shake it around until my arms get tired. I then just spin the armrest around and put it on the bathroom floor. Im too tired by then to deal with getting it completely dry. Other than these 3 things, the seat is wonderful!"
109993,2,"This cart is nice because you can wheel it around the house and we placed it in our living room next to the portacrib, but it cannot hold much weight (the photo is misleading with all that stuff stacked nicely!). I would probably not get this item again if I went back in time.If you're looking for some guidance on what you should buy for your baby registry (vs. what you can live without), visit AllMomsArePerfect.com and look under ""preparing for baby."" It's got tons of down to earth advice for those that like to be prepared when baby comes but don't want to do all the research on every single baby product."
109393,1,"My daughter is now 6 months old. We held off giving her solid foods for a little longer than usual because she has had some sensitivies while nursing & we wanted to make sure she was in the clear. I thought once I started offering her solids she'd be ready but hasn't been terribly interested in being spoon fed at all. On a whim I picked up this fresh food feeder & put a hunk of a peach in it. She took a little while warming up to it but then started nomming on it like a monster. She loves the way the mesh & cold fruit feels on her gums! It got a little messy so I wouldn't put anything in it that may stain.The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is that the child proof opener is tough for moms to open too, especially when coated with fruit slime."
54420,1,"My mom and I were shopping and saw this. We absolutely loved it! After I had set it up, however, my mom called me to tell me that an grandaughter of one of her friends liked it so much that she couldn't go to sleep when it was on, since it was so stimulating. I tried it anyway and our 4 week old smiled, cooed and then just watched in awe. It also helps relax him and sends him off to a full nights sleep. That was over 3 months ago and I use it at least 3 times a day. He still loves it and I have only changed the batteries once.It does sound sub-par to what we as adults would listen to, but my son doesn't seem to mind at all. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants their child to hear classical music, learn about shapes, and distance relationships.In fact, I will be sending this to a friend that just had her baby!"
125403,0,this product was ok but kinda big for my baby girl. Its a great idea but not that great. If you want some thing better for your baby to chew on i recommend The Original Baby Banana Brush.
15579,1,"A bit difficult to install, the guide for marking the placement of the screws was slightly off so we couldn't fit the feet on, but that's okay because we didn't actually need them. Looks nice, better than the white barred gates.I find it easy to open. I can do it one handed once you figure out how to do it. EASY TO CLEAN! We have the gate up to keep kids in our out of the kitchen. When eating lunch they tend to touch the gate with sticky messy hands but wipes off easily with a wet cloth.People often comment how nice the gate is. I love the neutral color. Happy with the purchase."
150410,0,"This hamper is a little small but it does the job. It holds 1-1.5 weeks worth of clothes which works for me because I try to wash my sons clothes once a week.***Update 11/19/12**Because of the material of the hamper it did not last as long as I wanted it too. It is now dented in on one side so I bought a different hamper. I don't know how the dent got there, but i just wish the hamper was made of a stronger material."
171443,1,"As a first time mom I LOVE this tub. The newborn sling makes it very easy and safe to bathe a newborn. Once my daughter was a few months older and too large for the sling, I easily removed it and she fits perfectly in the tub itself. The tub's design is excellent and keeps baby from 'scooting down' while seated and in a great position for bathing. It also fits perfectly in my undivided kitchen sink."
68058,2,This bag started ripping even before we took off. The seams are so weak it pulled apart as soon as we put the stroller in it... and the stroller is a lightweight umbrella stroller. By the time we got to our destination it was ripped in at least 3 different places and about half of the stroller was exposed. What a waste of money!
99513,1,These are a mix between Pampers Little Cruisers and Luvs diapers. The outside remind me of Luvs the inside just like Cruisers. They hold as much as Little Cruisers also. I think they're great and I am a diaper snob!! ha.
132724,0,"We were relatively happy with the Diaper Dekor + until only after one year of use, one of the 2 flaps that seals the unit became stuck in the downward position. Then about 3 months later the second one became stuck. So much for locking out the diaper scent. For the money (b/c this is after all the most expensive diaper system) I expected more use than one year.In addition, in the beginning I accidentally bought the refill bags for the Diaper Dekor and was so pleasantly surprised to find them very scented (I take them with me when I travel). I was disappointed when I bought the DD+ refills and realized they didn't have the same scent. BTW, if you're like me and don't have a Babies-r-Us in your city (what can I say, I live in kid-UNfriendly San Francisco) buying these online is the probably the cheapest way to go anyway.Now that our first unit seems to be broken, I'm seriously considering buying the Diaper Dekor original for the strongly scented bags, though I still worry about those flaps. Good luck!"
122810,2,"Velcro swaddles are much easier to use than this product which has nothing to secure the fabric. My son easily busted out of the swaddle, no matter how tight I wrapped him."
89633,1,"My daughter is tall and skinny (75th percentile for height and 10th percentile for weight) and these diapers have worked great for her since she was in the size twos. Very few blowouts when she was younger and now in the size threes and eating solid food, I don't think we've had any. She has sensitve skin and we haven't had any issues caused by these diapers (other brands yes, these diapers, no). Here on Amazon they are the best price I've found by far with Amazon Mom and Subscribe and Save. They always come quickly and we've never had any issues with the packaging. Highly recommend."

129829,0,I thought i needed to buy the base separately when I bought my GRACO Snuggleride car seat - but you don't. The same base comes with the car seat. You only need this you have two cars with the latch system and don't want to move the base (which is not hard to do) from car to car. I should also say that you don't need to use any base at all with the carseat - the carseat comes with instructions on how to seatbelt in just the carseat carrier part without the base (which is what lost of people do in non latch cars anyway - althoug the base can be seatbelted into not latch cars too). If you have a latch car it is safer to use the latch system and the base - but the carseat can also be seatbelted in just like in the nonlatch cars. Latch cars are cars built after 2002.
84638,1,we bought this as our daughter's 1st high chair when she was about 5 months old. I really like it she's comfy in it. the belt is easy to put on but we don't use it the tray has a piece of plastic that comes in beetween the legs so baby can't slip out. the try comes off so easy just one handed and cleans up really easy too. the cusion is plastic and it washes off nicely too! the little clear tray on top of the regular tray is dishwasher safe and it's nice for when juice get's spilled on it it just pops right off. the seat itself has a few differnt positions. we have only needed the upright one as she's sat up on her own fora while. sits so she is almost eye level with me. and it attaches to our chairs very securly and it was easy to do it. only thing I don't like about his is it doesn't fit under our table so it's not really a space saver like I thought it would be. but we have a decorative piece around the edge of our table makes it not fit by about 2 in. otherwise we love it!!
170064,1,This is the crib my daughter selected for her first child.It was more than she expected. It goes well in the nursery.We received it as scheduled. My daughter couldn't bemore pleased.
66514,1,"This is a real must-have for anyone who ever intends to travel with their children. Even going to grandma's house, its a snap to set up for nap time or over-nights. We take it with us when we go out of town, to set up in hotels since I was worried our 2 year old would fall out of a bed, and this isn't very far off the ground. And you just let the air out and tuck it away when it's not in use! The travel bag is great, and so is the pump it comes with."
152444,1,"We got this stroller when our sons were almost 3 and 10 months. Our oldest went through this stage after the baby was born that he did not want to ride so we had a compact Safety first stroller with second seat that did not recline or had a shade(just in case:))Well now all of a sudden he needs a comfy seat and wants to ride all the time. I looked at many tandem strollers(I just do not do side by side) and this one did the job. It is light(for a double), not too big(as a Graco), handle is high enough(in the side by side combi it was just too low). I have our 10 m old in the front and 3 year old in the back and it works great. Pushes nicely. Front seat has a nice recline(not just an inch like the Graco)Hoods are big, tried it in the store and it turns great. I am not sure why people had so many problems with it.Wonderful strollerUPDATE.................Used it for a year, had it on the wooded trails, 6 mile walks, walking to the grocery store(boy it fits a lot in the basket), had 3 kids riding in it, have our 3 1/2 year old(42 lb) ride in the front, still pushes nice.GOOD TO KNOW....i found a way to rotate back canopy forward so child gets more coverage(at the base where the screw is I pulled the plastic piece out so the canopy now can rotate forward.......great!!!!!!!!)Also ebay has universal trays that work great for the back seat."
162111,1,"This item was bought for me and my husband as a baby gift from my mom. I don't use it that often because I find it easier for me to bath with my child (he is 2 mos old). I don't see how it could leak, mine doesn't. And besides, if used in a regular bathtub, you shouldn't have problem. Except if you one with sliding glass doors, that can be a pain."
45312,1,"The techy-and-detailed couple love it, which really means something although their baby is too small to try it. Will update the review after real field experiments with its normal user. :D"
147737,0,"This car seat is very safe but does leave a lot to be desired. My son is almost 3 months old and barely fits into this car seat. It is not wide enough to accommodate a larger baby, the canopy leaves A LOT to be desired, and the fabric does not breathe making my child's back very sweaty. I did call Peg Perego's customer service (which is fantastic) and asked if they had a better canopy which they did not. The customer service department suggested I sew some fabric on the canopy to make it cover better -- get real! If Peg made some adjustments to their seat, it would be fantastic. I am going to look at a Britax."
32036,1,"Love this basinet liner. I have an oooold basinet that belonged to my sister that suits it's purpose but wasn't as pretty anymore after so many years. This covers the entire basinet and is a beautiful, simple cover."
62860,0,"I received this as a gift and like most other moms, found the refills to be expensive. I opted for a step lid pail purchased at a discount store and use regular grocery bags. I empty the pail daily which keeps the odor down and find that I have no problems...and save googobs of money."
9075,2,"I registered for this item because I thought it would come in handy despite the negative reviews I had read. I should have listened to my gut instinct. the player only worked a total of 3 seconds and when I called the 800 number they said just take it back, like they knew the item was defective and they were used to hearing about it. I exchanged it for the tape player and that didn't work at all so back to the store I go. Don't waste your time or your money."
59231,0,"This is a good bottle warmer if you're looking for no frills. However, it should have an automatic shut-off. And to be honest, the best way to get around a hungry crying baby is to have a thermos of warm water ready for quick feeding. I figured this out two months into it and now our lives are SO much easier."
28183,1,commenting on the reviews of people who are complaining about the size. This is a potty for EC aka elimination communication or infant potty training.I own baby bjorn little potty and primo. Primo is the most used hands down. For an active busy little baby it is a very nice buy. Very good buy for EC. animal potties are popular in China where EC is common.
77542,1,"We bought this swing right before my son was born and put it together right after we brought him home, and boy was it a lifesaver. At first, we put it together and the mobile would not work and made a horrible clicking sound and I was so disappointed. HOWEVER, we figured out it was us putting it together wrong and not the swing's problem. Well, we just had the canopy arranged where it was catching on the mobile and keeping it from moving. Once we fixed that it worked perfect. The speeds are great to me, nothing too fast or dangerous. It takes up a lot of room, but it is well worth it. I love the way it looks and I also love all the features. I call it the cadillac of baby swings. The canopy is a neat feature. It kind of puts my son into his own little cocoon and settles him down. The projector holds his attention. Even when he was only a week or so old he would notice the stars. The mobile he hasn't seemed to notice as much. I think he is watching the projector when he looks up. The speeds are great. The music is nice, nothing too annoying, very calming, puts my son to sleep, and love the nature sounds mixed in. Also, I love being able to set the volume. I also love that it has the option to use batteries or a plug. Trust me, the plug is a lifesaver. One less thing to need batteries. The seat is very soft and cushiony. This swing got my son to sleep and kept him asleep. I could nurse him to sleep and then set him in the swing and he would stay asleep. He is 3 months old now and so far we have not had a problem with any motors or anything. The motor is nice and quiet and rhythmic as far as motors go. The color on mine (the starlight model) is cream, blue, and purple. The purple is a periwinkle type color. Yes, periwinkle is a bluish-purplish color. I used this for my son. For starters, I think it is stupid to fit kids into these stereotypes of blue is for boys and pink is for girls. Second, the swing has blue in it. And third, if you really care about color more than quality, usefulness, and features that your baby will love, well then you have a problem. And yeah, if you sit here and get outraged because someone dared make a swing with blue and purple in it and no son of yours is going to sit in purple while he is an infant, well then you need psychological check. If you are not a psycho and want a good quality swing for a girl, boy, or something neutral, then this is it."
14055,1,"These bottles are wonderful! I breastfed and bottle fed my daughter from the begining. She didn't have any problem with nipple confusion at all, but as she got a little older, she didn't know how to suck on the regular nipples. I was using Evenflo Sensitive Response nipples. So, when I bought the Isis pump, I found my daughter LOVED these bottles. She knew right away how to suck on them, and unlike the Evenflo nipples, the milk did not run all down her chin. I like the fact that I can pump both sides using one bottle, unlike with the 4 oz. bottles, where I have to switch for each side. They are a bit expensive, but it definatly is worth it."
68429,1,"Have used this about for 3 months now (1 use per week, 2 hours each time) for facial hair. Initially, I didn't notice any changes, but I continued even though it is fairly painful and time consuming. After the first month, I began to notice a bit less hair. Not sure how long the other reviewer used this product for, but I think this process just takes multiple procedures and plenty of time.In regards to the pain that others have mentioned, I agree that it is annoying at first, but the device allows you to lower the intensity. I basically used a lower intensity first and after awhile I got used to the sensation so now use the device at the mid-high level. In fact, it's recommended by the manufacturer to start with a lower intensity level first to see if your skin can handle the procedure without permanent scarring. There will be temporary faint reddish marks after each use but they go away in 1-2 days with use of skin lotion.I can confidently say that after 2 months of usage (roughly 1-2 times a week depending on the speed of your hair growth) you'll notice the changes. If you're not a patient person or have a low pain threshold, you will want to avoid this product. I gave this product 4 stars because it worked for me but it is slow process that takes time so I can't recommend it to everybody."
142712,2,"After reading the previous review I went out and purchased this product. I liked the idea of mesh sides, sturdy base and easy portability. But, when I received it the canopy was too floppy in the open position - so floppy I had to cut it off!. They should have designed it where the whole canopy was removable. If the infant is inside it must be in the closed position. I am also finding trouble finding a properly fitted sheet (it does not come with any sheet) and the mattress is thin."
41272,1,"Pampers Cruisers are the best diapers so far that my babies ever tried.Soft, delicate, flexible. They have good comfortable fit. The last two boxes though had a little bit different quality. I think they are not as soft as they were. But still it is the best compare to any other brand."
15905,1,"I use it with the Bugaboo Cameleon instead of buying the more expensive cover from Bugaboo. I love it, it keeps my 14 month old really nice and cozy and when he has a hat on he is completely covered! I also like the look compared to the regular Bundleme."
119535,2,This monitor is nice for the light show but everything else is horrible. I also think it has a very annoying clicking sound and it the portable radio only works plugged in. The baby cries and I don't hear a thing!
39010,2,"I bought this for my jogging stroller to run and protect my babe from the sun...but when all said and done, it is simply too complicated! Everything has to be tied on, and then you have to untie everything to get your little one out! I wish they would have used velcro, it would have made more sense. I think for walking every once in awhile it would be fine, but for an avid runner who needs something every day, not worth it. I will be spending the extra $$$ and buying the BOB sunshade."
54669,1,this mobil is a gift sent from above. my son loves this mobil it has bright colors and adorable creatchers and got my son to take long naps and sleep throgh the night! I wish I had one ! P.S WARNING WHEN YOUR CHILD BEGINS TO REACH AND GRAB THE MOBIL TAKE THE ANIMAL PART OFF AND LEAVE THE MUSIC
147815,2,"I am extremely disappointed in my Peg Perego carseat and stroller. I find them extremely difficult to use and poorly designed. The carseat is also very heavy - much heavier than many other models - so you really don't want to have to lug it around without the stroller (which can be a monster to unfold by yourself). I am so disappointed because I love the way these look - they are so sporty and stylish looking. And they're also fairly expensive for this particular product so you would hope they'd be better than all the rest. My daughter is only a month old and I am already researching bigger kid carseats and strollers for when she outgrows this one. I'll continue to use this one and I will probably use it with any subsequent children because despite being a beast and a pain in the a**, it is also high quality and will likely last quite a long time. Plus, like I said, I really like the way it looks. I get so tired of the sea of navy blue stroller and carseat sets out there. At any rate, the fact that my daughter will outgrow this in five months does not bother me - it's the fact that I have to suffer with it until then (but that is of course my choice!). Next time around I'll be looking at Britax and McLaren - they seem to be the way to go."
63992,0,"This swaddle blanket seems to run small, my 16 pound baby barely fits in it. I have another size large swaddle by kiddopotamus and it is much bigger."
33661,1,"I have used the gate and it is the best one I bought so far. It is easy to use and the slide wood pressure mount works perfectly. It keeps my cat from jumping over it, and he can jump. Thanks again please do not hesitate to buy it.KLMoscaNY"
41557,1,"We've only been using it for about 2 months now but sofar it's worked very well. It picks up EVERYTHING...very sensitive. The light is very handy late at night when you want to check on your baby but don't want to turn on the lights and risk waking her up. Very soft, gentle glow."
154948,1,"Upon receiving our Dreamer Ditto, we found that the straps attaching the seats to the bottom of the jogger were frayed. We contacted Dreamer (although we bought the jogger from another vendor) and they sent us new replacement seats within days! We've never had such great customer service. We love our jogger and are thrilled with the product itself."
172761,0,"I have to agree with those who don't care for the shower part of this tub. The shower/pump seemed like a good idea when we saw it in the store, but the line always twists and the stream of water is too light. Maybe for NEW babies, but even when mine was a few weeks old, he would cry. We ended up using the tub and sling and then washing him with our kitchen sink sprayer (which is easier to hold when your hands are soapy)and he loves it."
99544,1,"Since we have two sets of twins and spend lots of money on diapers, I'm always keen to find the best price per diaper, as long as the diaper works well. Originally, my conclusion was that the storebrand diapers at Sam's Club were our best bet, so we used them exclusively with our first set of twins. I did try some Pampers and other brands early on, but quickly determined that they weren't worth the extra money. When Amazon Mom came along I revisited the price per diaper issue and found out that I can get these Pampers for less than the ones I get at Sam's, PLUS they show up on my porch on the day I want them to! These diapers work as well as the Sam's ones, at least for daytime use, so we're good with them until we're done diapers. We use the size 4 during the day and size 5 at night for extra protection. I did end up going back to the Sam's brand for the size 5 diapers for nighttime use since the Pampers don't hold as much liquid as the Sam's ones. In fact, for one of our twins we use the Pampers Extra Protection and sometimes even that isn't enough for him. I'll write a separate review for that one."
67574,2,These really feel like someone took a napkin and slightly dampened it; way too hard/(crispy?) and dry . They do not make me smell clean or for that matter feel clean.
97062,1,Cloud b Sleep Sheep - Four Soothing Sounds From NatureThis is the third one I have bought via Amazon. My grandchildren love it. Make sure and get theone that has mom's heartbeat as it is their favorite. Priced high in stores and reasonable throughAmazon.
58328,2,"I can see how this product may work for other kids, but lemme tell you: within 30 seconds of installation, my 13-month old bent the thing forward and proceeded to play with the tv buttons as usual. We kept it there, since it was a slight (a very slight) deterrent - bought us about 2 seconds before button pushing ensued - but with all the bending, he broke it off in 6 months. If you've got a strong, persistant, rambunctious kid (it only worsens with age, folks), I think this product is a big waste of money."
177599,1,"This breast pump is so easy to use and so convenient. I love the fact that I can control the pump and I can take it ANYWHERE! I use it everywhere I need to including the car. I love the accessories that it comes with. I can pump my milk and place the nipple right onto the bottle and feed my baby. I can't tell you how many times I've done that. There are several parts to wash and you can only do one breast at a time, but it's completely easy to use. I used the medela dual electric pump with my first child, and I have to say I am so happy with this breast pump-mostly because of convenience."
14099,1,These bottles are the perfect size and work great with the Avent Isis breast pump. I never had a problem with them leaking at all. You can freeze with them too. The 4 oz. size is perfect for the breastfeeding mother. The milk doesn't come out fast at all. Great bottles.
111108,1,This cover was wonderful to have. My son was strictly breast feed for the first six months so it was used a lot. The cover did fall apart a little after the first washing and shrunk a little even washing on cold. I am very big chested and it covered me very well. With the opening at the top I could see him. The cover did get very hot. I had a spring baby so it was used a lot in the summer and he's a hot box so with the cover he would come out sweating. All in all great cover. I would hand wash it if I were to get a new one.
35855,2,"One of the worst purchases I've ever made. The stroller will not work without inflating the tires, and guess what? They are impossible to inflate! The design of this stroller is so poor so as to make it actually unusable. It's a shame there are products like this on the market. It is especially infuriating given the large price tag. I wish I could more eloquent in my loathing of this piece of junk, but having flushed $400 down the toilet has me at a loss for words."
101924,0,"My son is teething and chewing on everything. So I bought this one day hoping he'd just love it. I personally liked everything about it, all the textures and the clicking sound. But my son just didn't care. He doesn't find it interesting at all. Bummer, I still think it's great though."
172602,2,"It seemed like a great idea, but the ""shower"" flow was more like a leaky drip. The shower head button was difficult to hold in w/out messing up the little water flow that did trickle out. I also felt the tub itself was too short, and my 7 month old is small for her age. Lastly, the handle that is supposed to be used to hang it up on the shower rod to store/dry the tub, did not fit over my rod. It might fit yours though.For being the more expensive tub out there, I definately do not think it's worth the extra money."
46365,1,"I feel like I read hundreds of reviews before I bought this, so I guess it's my turn to return the favor...Before buying, I compared this play yard with the North States version. NS had lots of reviews about broken panels and after getting the Summer Infant panels, I can tell that this one is tougher. Also, you can lock the yard into the shape you want which is a GREAT feature (the NS bends and does not retain its shape).I'm happy with it so far. It's better on carpet; it WILL slide on a hard surface, so be wary. I also bought the extension panels, which came together upside down (had to unscrew the knobs to put it back together correctly) but not that big of a deal once I figured it out.Overall, I would recommend this product. I can't compare it with 100% certainty to the NS play yard, but after all the reviews I read, I'm confident that I chose the right one."
125078,2,"The seat is too small for my 4 month old. His head hangs over the top and his feet hang over the bottom.At the same time, this seat was too big for my normal-sized kitchen sink.If you want your baby immersed in water, do not buy this. While it has the adjustable straps, they do not work and baby is basically laying flat. Just imagine your baby on a pillow with a little dip in the middle for his/her bottom.It is very soft, so if you don't want your baby immersed in water, it could be a good buy. Also, a smaller baby may have better luck with this (mine is 16lbs).Returning this and buying a bath ring."
146494,1,My 6 month old loves this jumperoo. She jumps like crazy in it and likes to play with the attached toys. Even if she's grumpy she enjoys playing in it. One thing to note though: she's on the tall side for her age and is just barely tall enough to have her toes reach the floor as they should. If you wanted to put a shorter baby in it I guess you could put a phone book or something under their feet. I'd definately recommend it.
170264,1,"My knowledge of cribs is very limited. So with that in mind, we wanted something that was simple without all the bells and whistles. Since we needed a crib for our small room, we decided on purchasing the Emily mini crib. Right out of the box, I thought ""Damn! This thing is way too small and it looks flimsy!"" The gods from Davinci corp proved me wrong! After whipping everything together, I was shocked to see how awesome the little crib looks. It is extremely sturdy and well designed. Although the crib is white, I expect it to deal with all the damage that will be inflicted upon it by the little Godzilla who will live inside of it. I am sure the white bar will be a scrumptious delicacy for mini Godzillas little jaws. Anyway my only problem with the crib was the blue prints. First of all, they were not blue, secondly the instructions were not very thorough. The individual pieces were not labeled, hence no reference to what goes where. The parts that were drawn on the instructions were slightly off the actual parts. This did not help, as I tried to build the crib as I would any Ikea furniture by simply looking at the pictures and comparing the parts. Eventually, after putting parts on backwards and such, I was able to finish the crib along with the additional instructions to use washers on all the screws. Within the packaging I was also missing several of the 3 inch bolts. After a small talk with Amazon, a partial refund was issued, and I went to Lowes and was able to pick up alternative bolts. So in conclusion (TLDR) this crib was an excellent purchase. Well designed, sturdy, along with an excellent array of raw materials. The platform for the bed is adjustable and can be lowered to ones preference."
38322,1,"I used this bathtub 5 years ago for my eldest kid after trying one another kind of tub. This bath tub offers maximum safety from falls/skids and takes out the fear from bathing a infant, specially if you are new to doing it. It is easy to clean but make sure you hang it up to drain the water within a couple of hours after using it. Leaving it in water several times for long periods will result in green mold."
184104,2,"This works fine but cannot be washed due to the bottom made of cardboard. Also if you put too many diapers, it does not close well."
139749,2,"Primo high chair does not fit a chunky baby, the lamination is not holding up and I am disappointed in it as I loved the look of it. The height for the baby at the table is way off, so my daughter had to purchase another high chair for her baby. I am going to make some adjustments and hope it will serve as an ocassional use chair here at my house instead of daily use by a growing baby."
66187,1,"Dr. Brown's bottles are great! I recently purchased these bottles because my daughter suffers from reflux and needed rice added to her formula to thicken her feedings. At that time I was using Avent bottles and they did not have a nipple to accommodate the thickened formula. So, I purchased Dr. Brown's bottles and used the ""y"" cut nipples for the thickened formula. They worked great.The only downside to these bottles is that when warmed, the milk sometimes rises into the tube inside the bottle which causes the milk to leak out into the warmer. Needless to say, I have had to clean my bottle warmer several times. Now, I warm them up without a top on it and everything is fine."
164223,1,"They were good until my baby outgrew them and then they leaked. So, we are now moving on up to 4!"
174074,0,"My husband and I had a daughter in February of this year (2006). When we brought her home from the hospital she would cry and fuss whenever we placed her in either her travel crib or her larger crib. One day we tried letting her nap in her Baby Papason swing during the night. Mind you, she had never even been in the swing. Without even using the motor to let her swing, she immediately fell asleep. We think it is because the swing and its cozy shape mimiced the feel of being held in someone's arms. She has since then switched to sleeping in her large crib, but still loves daytime napping in her swing.Yet, I must lower the rating to a 3 as when we are using the actual motor to swing her, the swing gives off a loud ticking sound with each swing. We followed the clerk's directions at the store and ""warmed it up"" by placing a 5 pound water jug in it for awhile, but the clicking sound continued. We think our daughter finds the clicking sound somewhat comforting, but it bugs us something awful!"
23377,2,"I registered for this item back when I was pregnant with my son. I liked how you could use any garbage bag instead of specific ones for this product, but that's the only good thing about this. I have a theory, anything that needs multiple D size batteries might as well have plug. Needless to say the batteries didn't last long at all for the filter and I haven't changed them since because A: batteries are expensive, B: I can't figure out how to change them, and C: what new mom has time? It also makes this item very top heavy so if the bottom is empty, it falls over constantly.It also has a wedge that you clip into the top that is supposed to push the diapers through a barrier (which is now stuck open) into the bag. I don't understand why the wedge wouldn't be permantely attached to the top, and as a result ours detached into the dirty diaper bag, and I didn't realize this until it was long gone, so now we have to place the diapers in by hand. Now that my son is 3, his diapers are bigger and we have to change it every few days. The only reason I haven't thrown it out the window is because it was a gift, (but I can't wait for the day my son is finally potty trained so I never have to see it again.)If you are thinking about buying this, you are better off with a regular garbage can."
136396,1,"I bought this for my son about a month ago, and we LOVE it!!! He loves all the toys and can sit in there for up to an hour! He is a very curious baby and this helps with his curiosity!However this does take a while to assemble and if you're anything like me, the instructions won't help much, lol. But after all the pieces are put together, you'll see how awesome this really is! I just wish I could take this with me on our trips by plane. Anyway, this is a grea buy!"
140374,1,"This may be the best thing I have ever bought in my entire life. It was the only thing that could get our firstborn to sleep without being held. It took about 1 week of the sound going constantly for it to stop working, and somehow the mobile got broken in storage between baby 1 and baby 2, but otherwise we have found it to be very durable. It has lasted through 2 kids with heavy use with no problems. Our first born slept in it probably 80% of the time until she could roll over and our second about 40%. After they can roll over it is pretty much useless and just makes them mad, but until then it will sooth a cranky baby that you can't get to sleep any other way. A work of advice: don't attach the tray. I don't know what you'd actually use it for and it just gets in the way when you get them in and out. The straps hold them in securely without it. The only drawback it that it doesn't breakdown very small, so it's pretty impractical for travel. We always just plugged it into the wall, so I don't know how long batteries last."

181354,1,"My three month old loves this playmat! He loves the butterflies and the monkey. I only wish the butterflies moved by themselves, but that's okay. Every time I put him on it, he gets really excited!"
41026,1,"Our daughter wore nothing but Swaddlers and when the tme came to move up into 3's we moved to the Baby Dry becasue they are a great daiper and were cheaper. We went through one case before we switched to the Cruisers. She became very active right aobut the time she wentt into 3's. She was crawling, sitting up, rolling over...she was mobile to say the least. She kept popping hte tabs in the Baby Dry becasue they didn't move with her. The Cruisers have more stretch to them adn she's never had that problem since.She wasn't in the 3's long before she moved on into 4's and now at 14 1/2 months we're still using Cruisers in a 5 when she's not wearing Pull Ups."
43568,0,"I searched for baskets for my baby's changing table for HOURS!!! (I was on bed rest, so I had the time to kill) I finally decided to go with these because they seemed so popular. I was very excited for them to arrive but when I opened the box they smelled pretty strongly of paint - not good for a baby nursery, or for a pregnant woman for that matter! I wanted to give them a chance though and I figured they'd air out, so I put them up on the changing table shelves. They are so tall and deep that it was actually a pain because I have to pull them out to see in them and get the items out. At first I figured I could live with that even if it was annoying, but the white paint is scratching all over my beautiful cherry wood changing table that I just bought! So frustrating!! I'm returning these baskets. I found some beautiful soft wicker ones for half off at a local store to replace them. Thank goodness I'm off bed rest now so I can shop in store! Normally I'm an online shopper, but for baskets I recommend finding something in a physical store. These might be okay if you have a REALLY tall space to put them in and the shelf you're putting them on is already white, because the white paint transposes if you move the basket it on it at all. Otherwise, you should pass on these."
153382,1,We are buying to give as a gift. We think this will be a big hit for the new mom.
166662,2,these daipers are no good to use.. always leaks and gives diaper rash.. not worth the money.. Pampers swaddlers are much better than these daipers.

156551,2,"I would never buy this swing, it is unsafe. My daughters head falls through the sides and it gets stuck while the swing continues to try to swing. Her head jams in between the sides and the legs.Then when she is in it, it hardly moves. Very weak in swinging and the mobile sits right in front of her face. Unsatisfied!"
64462,2,"This product is just awful. It arrived cracked, which really wasn't its biggest problem. The bumpers to hold the gate in place were totally inefficient, because the holes for the pumper screws were drilled too large. I returned it immediately."
141952,1,This is a great product! I have a sleigh-style crib so it works great for us. We only had to cover 2 sides of the crib rails and had a little left over. VERY easy to install and doesn't come off.
47328,1,Love this cleaning shampoo. Used it on my first born. Now using it on my newborn. Worth very penny. Plan to use it until my kids are older.
100962,1,"As an avid club-store shopper I was crushed to see the quality of the generic and Huggees Supreme diapers available there were not nearly as nice as the Pampers Baby Dry. My philosophy with my kid is ""if I wouldn't wear it, I won't make my baby wear it"" and (if they came large enough) I would wear the Pampers Baby Dry. They hold a ton of liquid, and have never leaked for us.I have had a very hard time finding value sized packs of size 6 pampers at my local big box stores. They will only have a small pack of 40 diapers if they cary the size 6 at all. Thank goodness for Amazon and supersaver shipping!Our little girl is definitely ""Pampered""."
86137,1,"This monitor is fantastic. The picture is very clear, even in the dark, and the sound is super sensitive. The battery lasts a long time, and after almost 2 years of daily use it is still working perfect and we have had zero problems with it. Every once in a while we'll get a tad bit of static, but the house is pretty big, so it's expected. This was definitely worth the money."
25680,0,"My wife and I liked the idea of the head support to keep my son's head from slumping forward in an awkward position when sleeping in his car seat. The supports are ease to install, but our son did not like them we think because his head was locked into position - that along with the seat locking his body in place must make for snug ride.In the end, we reclined his seat just a bit which did the trick."

134572,2,"This product could more appropriately be called a ""toddler urine catcher,"" because that's what it does. What do I mean? I mean that urine actually collects inside of it and then drips out (after fermenting for a few days) around the edges and on to your real toilet seat. Obviously the people that designed this are childless."
182017,1,"You can't just throw the attachment anywhere onto the stroller you feel like putting it, and expect it to work perfectly! It takes a bit of trial and error to get any type of after-market accessory to attach to a stroller...and guess what?? They're not all going to work on every stroller! Also, many stroller makers are purposely making their strollers now so that there isn't anywhere to attach these items, because of the potential for accidents or injuries. Peg made their tubing oval shaped for that exact reason: LIABILITY. And that's also why most upper-price-range good quality stroller makers don't include a snack tray or a cupholder; they don't want to be held responsible if some yuppie mommy spills her frappucino on her baby. Use your brainds, mamas."
42040,1,"I just purchased this stroller, and thanks to the reviews here on amazon I knew exactly what I was getting. For me, it's just right. I just went for a walk around the neighborhood in it and I found that the canopy is a bit short, but by adjusting the seat recline the sun stayed off my baby's face. I like the length of the canopy because it allows my baby to look me in the eyes while we walk. The number one reason I bought this stroller is because the baby can be turned to face me as I walk. I rarely see strollers that do that and that is important to me.I am 100% satisfied with this stroller. I love the diversity it offers, I can have baby facing me or away from me, I can adjust the handlebar to any height and the recline is super easy to adjust. It's very easy to maneuver, great to push, and it even looks super cool! It is large when it is folded up in my trunk, but no larger than my Graco was. I have no complaints!"

184378,1,"I got this because my third baby refused to sleep in bed by himself. I was sleeping in a recliner with him in my arms before deciding to break down and get this. Unfortunately, he wouldn't sleep in this thing either.However, I have a 3.5 and a 2 year old also. This was great on the couch as a relatively safe place to put him down for 2 minutes. It was especially great as a changing table in my living room so that I didn't have to leave my two toddlers alone in the living room to go change a diaper.I have to agree with other posters that the length runs out quickly, but frankly, by the time they run out of room, they are starting to roll around to the point that it isn't safe to leave them in it anyway."
133547,0,"I researched sippy cups to death trying to find a non-plastic solution. I have the Born Free 9oz bottles and level 2 nipple and they are wonderful. I just got the 9+ month hard spout and tried it with my baby. He has never liked to drink water out of his normal milk bottles but after first hesitation he kept on wanting a bit more of the water! He is 7 months now so is also teething a bit and he enjoyed chewing on the spout as well. This is positive so far, however, I tested out the spout and compared it to the Take and Toss sippy plastic cups. Do you know that the water tasted better out of the plastic cup than my glass bottle with the plastic spout? I was not happy about that at all. The flow of the water is steady enough for the baby to drink but not get overwhelmed. You only need to do a gentle suck and a nice amount of water comes through. I would suggest people not even bother with the soft trainer spout as I read that they can cause problems for the baby trying to suck too hard.. doesn't' that negate the reason for a sippy cup which is to introduce a baby to sipping and not sucking? So I think that this may work out for us for the time being, however, when he gets old enough to want to throw the glass sippy bottle we will have to find another solution. I may get the Klean Kanteen and put the Born Free spout on there for a less destructible sippy.So on to the cons:Material: hard plastic BPA free. Why didn't Born Free make a silicone or rubber spout rather than plastic? They seem to be at the forefront of giving their customers choices between plastic or glass, why such shoddy spout material? They have to know that their customer base is due to the chemicals in plastic scare. That being said, the spout only has a small slit, no real holes. Other reviewers mentioned that their baby chews on the spout making the hole too big and the water comes gushing out. They could have made a more durable product as well. Other reviewers mention that this is only a 9+ month solution, it would be nice to have a next stage up spout for toddlers so that we can extend the use of these expensive bottles! I will be taking my bottles to the store and looking at the competitors SILICONE spouts to see if they will fit the Born Free bottles.My other complaint about Born Free is why are the prices so ridiculous? I have paid $27 worth for size 2 nipples, I don't even want to add up the cost of using this brand in the end. That being said, I still think the Born Free is a great bottle solution, just expensive. My other experience is with Avent which I liked but hated the only choice of having plastic."
28197,1,"I read the reviews on this product before I bought it, and although some of them say this stool isn't that great I bought it anyway, and I am glad I did. This step stool is sturdy and a good size for using to help your little one reach the toilet for potty training. My son is 45 pounds and it seemed to hold him with no trouble, no buckling or denting. One of the reviews I read says that the textured bumps on the surface are painful to stand on, and I have to disagree (this might be a design change) the textured bumps are not rough or pokey, they provide a surface that is not slick to stand on. The only downside to this stool is finding a place to store it, but that is a problem you face when you go with a sturdy non-foldable stool."
54717,1,"Whoever invented this mobile has a million thank-you's coming their way! I bought a standard mobile for my 3 month old son's crib which matched the bedding and he seemed completely disinterested and would get fussy when I would wind it up. I was over at a friends house recently, (she ownes the Symphony mobile) and laid my baby in her crib for a nap. He was absolutely mesmerized by this mobile!! The music is soothing and the mobile itself is so colorful and active, he stared unblinking at this thing for 45 minutes! Well, that very same day I went and purchased one for myself. My son LOVES it so much, he fusses if I take him out of his bed now. This mobile is a must, in my opinion!"
67662,1,"So far I love this car seat and so does my son. He is still sitting facing backwards waiting to turn one. He is a large boy, and I needed to upgrade him from his infant seat at a little over six months of age. He was much happier in his new car seat than his little infant seat. He is currently about 10 months old, is 31 inches tall and weighs about 23.5 lbs. While he is still content to look backwards, I'm sure he will be happier to face forward. The belts are easy to use and it fits just fine in my vehicle, which is an SUV. I have not had any problems with the diaper area being too tight as mentioned in several other reviews of the same product without the Nebraska logo. All in all a great seat!"
76686,0,"I purchased this item for my newborn boy after getting sprayed multiple times a day. The idea of the pee pee teepee sounded great, but it was hard to use. It didn't really stay in place. It is a little small so it has to be held down while changing the diaper which was quite a challenge. After trying a few times my husband and I finally gave up on using it."
74688,0,"I bought this walker based on the reviews it has which are pretty good. But, when I got it hope I was disappointed. It's cute and sturdy and all, but it has these rubber bumpers on the bottom that prevent it from rolling on carpet. It moves freely on wooden or linoleum floors, but not at all on carpet. I have yet to remove the bumpers to see if it will work better."
148873,1,"This is not just for pregnant women. It works great for arthritics, too. I'm only 51 and already have very bad arthritis pain in my knees, hips, foot and sometimes back. I love sleeping with this body pillow. It helps me sleep on my back better (I WAS a stomach sleeper) and longer. I am short and this cuts in at the bottom in just the right place to elevate my legs just enough. For side sleeping, it keeps my knees from having to touch, which causes great pain, quickly. This pillow also helps keep me snuggly and warm, which helps my arthritis, too.When I just want to rest or read a book, it can be folded to prop me up at just the right angle. It would be perfect for bedtime TV watching, too.The down side is the inside curve of the head part of the pillow. It should have been made with elastic and shirring. It tends to cut tightly across my shoulder at times. I have to readjust my position to avoid that. Also, this seems to be molded more for short people. At 5'2"", it's just perfect for me. But, I don't know if it would be as helpful for a taller person. I'm going to try some of the other suggestions of turning the pillow around and using my own pillow for my head and see how that works."
42243,1,Easy to use after some practice. Both my husband and I use it and our daughter sleeps soundly when carried.
46990,0,"This cover works OK, it does the job, but what was disappointing was that when I originally ordered it, the cover that was pictuured on amazon.com was pink in color and had a very pretty design. When I received it, it was the black and white that is currently shown on the picture. I imagine that a number of people complained about the misleading picture, hence the company fixed the picture and it now shows the actual item that you receive. If I had known that this cover was this black and white design and not the pink that I originally saw, I would not have purchased. But it is helpful with nursing my newborn so I will keep it."
110252,2,"FWIW, I purchased my Shermag on Amazon a few months before DS' arrival and because it was a better price than BRU and they wouldn't match. Anyway, Amazon has already replaced my glider once, and it's broken again. The locking mechanism has failed, jolting the chair into a locked position when I'm rocking it. (It's such a jolt it should have a ""Caution: Whiplash Happens"" sign on it) So I HATE this chair. As far as I'm concerned, I would throw it down my stairs if it wouldn't do a lot of damage to the walls and stairs. I emailed Shermag about it and basically told them I hate it so much there's no way I even want a replacement. It's horribly uncomfortable as well.Oh - ETA and the bolts come out of the ottoman once or twice a day. Even with DH screwing them in as tightly as he can.Shermag = FAIL. Don't do it.If I could give it 0 stars, I would have."
72334,1,"These were a lifesaver for my child (who had a weak suck from birth). We went 2 weeks without it but she was really struggling to latch & my ability to nurse was being compromised. A lactation consultant told me that it's better to use one of these if absolutely necessary than to stop nursing from difficulties with latching.She saved us!! My baby used this for the next 3 weeks or so & then I slowly weaned her off of it with the help of a lactation nurse & MOPS group. We are still going strong & she's 5 months old.I definitely think people should try their VERY best to go au naturale when it comes to nursing but if you're doing everything you can & it still isn't working, this could be your answer. Yes, carrying around a Nipple Shield is a pain but if you get help/advice from a nurse you can wean off of this in no time when your baby figures it out.Oh & some babies never develop a great latching ability. My baby is still a pain & doesn't want to work for her meal....she's just come to realize that her mommy is MUCH more stubborn than her =) Good luck!"
114976,2,i bought the sure and secure gate and like the others it served its purpose till my son started walking. he would hang on it and try to shut it (would slam it shut) then the hinges broke. we called and got new ones and we put metal long screws in it and it broke again. it actually broke off the wall. i am very dissatisified.
157968,1,"Of all the gear and baby products we've purchased, if I had to pick just one, this would be it. We currently use it in our baby's bassinet and pack n' play and it works excellently. I'm hoping it works this well when we put our baby in his crib where the mattress is thicker. It allows us to sleep with peace of mind. The sensor needs a hard surface to rest on, so in order to use it in the pack n'play we purchased the $15 piece of masonite that was advertised in the package."
43482,2,"This stroller, though handy, has two major flaws:1) It is difficult to unfold, and2) Once the carseat is snapped in place, it is VERY difficult to get any items in and out of the basket due to the fact that the carseat rests very low on the frame.My advice: Buy the Snap & Go instead!! My friend has one and her basket is easily accessible with the carseat in place."
50170,1,"The gate is pretty much as described. I have 2 (one for each end of the stairway) and we have been pretty pleased with them. The latches on this gate will even keep adult visitors off the stairs, but with a little practice it is not too difficult to open the gate with one hand and carry the baby in the other."
55099,0,"We bought this stroller when we were expecting our twins. (Based on input from another multiple mom who couldn't stop raving about it). We were happy with the stroller for the first several months. However, there were things about the stroller that DEFINITELY need to be improved:1) The basket underneath started dragging on the ground after just a few uses (with light toys stored underneath).2) The front wheels started getting caught in the basket when we would open the stroller...which is happening almost everytime we open it now.3) The harnesses are SUCH a pain. They should have made them similar to the harness that they use for the car seats that accompany this stroller.4) If you don't remove the front tray EVERY time before folding down the stroller, it gets scratched up easily.5) As our children got older, the stroller became harder to maneuver. One of the reasons I wanted this stroller was that I was told how easy it was to turn with one hand. However, my children are only 18 & 21 lbs., and it's already difficult to turn the stroller.6) The weight. It is definitely one of the heavier strollers. However, I've gotten used to that.7) Only two seat adjustments on the back seat. All the way reclined, or all the way up.So, all in all, this was a good 'first' stroller for twins...but not something that we can use for much longer. It did maneuver well at first, but no longer."
104433,1,"I bought this item to use at the Animal Rescue center I volunteer at. The puppies at the center are kept in ""puppy rooms"" ,because under 6 mo. of age, they cannot be on any floors, other then the rooms. This gate makes it so easy to clean, feed, and cuddle with the pups. No more climbing over the old fashion wooden extension ones."
49858,2,I have a toddler who just loves to sit in the refrigerator. After redirecting him from the refrigerator and many tantrums later I decided to get this refrigerator lock. I can't believe it has as many good reviews as it does. I wonder if people would update their reviews if they would feel the same way about it. We installed this Tuesday afternoon. By Thursday morning my son came up to me with the latch in his hand. The adhesive is poor. When I tried to reaatach it I could see why it so easily came off. My toddler does not have super human strength... it's a flimsy product. Don't bother. :-(
83260,1,"I got this 1 year ago when I was having my 1st baby and I love it, now its 12 months later and we still use it all the time."
64377,0,"My husband brought this backpack for me to carry our 11 month old daughter in because the Evenflo Cross Terrain Carrier is too heavy for me. Unlike the Evenflo Cross Terrain Carrier this Smart Support Backpack does not have any place to store diapers, wipes, bottles and the rainhood. Lack of storage space is the reason that it's not worth the money. I believe I'll keep looking for a backpack that is functional and lightweight."
26092,0,"We bought two of these seats: one for my car and one for my wife's.She and I have had pretty good experiences with the seat. Our daughter...now about 3.5 months....sleeps in it all the time. She fusses when she gets strapped in, but falls asleep as soon as you pick it up.I've seen a lot of comments that this seat gets outgrown too quickly and we are concerned about this too. The little girl is about 15 pounds now and I'd say the end is near. It also isn't a light seat at all. My wife and I don't mind much as we're both pretty strong, but I wonder how some scrawny couples can manage these things. When the whole thing starts to approach 25 pounds, that's heavy when you have to lug it around a lot.Here's the real killer for the seat.....it works great in our vehicles (Volvo V70 and Ford F150). However, the grandparents watch her sometimes too and there the problems begin. I can get the base out of the Volvo and into my mother's Pontiac Grand Prix in about 30 seconds. On the other hand....it does not fit well in my in-laws cars. One is a mid 1990's Mercedes that is pre-latch. The seat belts are set up in such a way that you really can't use them safely. The other is a pretty new Cadillac Seville, although it has LATCH, the straps on the base are not long enough to clip the base to the anchors! I actually cut my hand straining to install the base this morning. The center seat belt in the Seville has such a lousy set up that I didn't even try it and just swapped cars with them.I guess the take away is that your kid will outgrow this seat which is kind of a kick in the teeth considering the cost. It is also heavy and you really need to check to see if it'll fit in your vehicle."
41505,1,"These are great diapers for my 12 month old, she is already walking and so far she has not been able to tear them off!"
9248,1,"Comfortable, wildly easy to clean with no nooks or crannies, attractive in an adult designed bathroom. My daughter loves to use it and can sit on it for a very long time without being uncomfortable. We also bought the matching safe step stool and the set was very much worth the money. We get compliments all the time and I'm happy we didn't have to buy yet another chunk of pink plastic on our journey to potty training perfection."
72443,0,The car seat still moves as much after putting this on...ok my the actual seat below is taking a bit of less beating
104195,1,"There aren't a lot of dinosaur lamps out there to choose from, but this one is the neatest by far!! It is every bit as cute as pictured, and looks fantastic in my son's dinosaur room. Not too much color either, so it blends well with just about any dino decor. Worth every penny!! I need another lamp in his room, I wish I could find another as cute as this."
163199,1,"This is the only baby gift that we received that we still use. It may look like a really silly idea, but it is very conventient for bathing the young ones every night.Give it as a gift and your friends will thank you - maybe not right away, but definitely after they use it for a while and learn to appreciate it."
26433,1,"Sturdy & Stylish. This bouncer does not have a vibration feature but is oversized and can fit a larger baby. Also, it is more of a rocker than a bouncer but does bounce slightly. It is easy to clean since the cover is removable and the fabric is very plush. Both the back and the footrest are adjustable to the point where you can create a little rocking chair once the baby is older. I love the carrying handles. Overall this is an awesome bouncer that is more sturdy than the average bouncer on the market."
58195,1,"I purchased this step stool for my toddler last year to aid her in reaching the sink to brush her teeth. It was the perfect height for my then-2-year old, and she continues to use it every day. She loves the safari design and uses the storage compartment to keep her toothbrush and toothpaste handy. It took just a few minutes to assemble, and after several months of daily use has held up exceptionally well. We have had no issues with paint flaking or any other problem with this product. I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
88469,2,"This carrier is fine when compared to other similar (more expensive carriers such as baby Bjorn). I used this one with my first child and it was fine until the baby got to about 15 pounds. Then it made my back hurt terribly. With baby #2, I found that there are much better ways to carry my baby.I now use a wrap (such as Moby or Ellaroo) almost exclusively. The wrap is so much more comfortable (both for me and baby). I can carry my baby on my front, vertically or horizontally as well as on my back. I can carry my 2 year old (30 pounds) on my front, back, or hip. The Moby is my absolute favorite for carrying an infant. I prefer a woven wrap such as the Ellaroo or Gypsy Mama Gauze wrap for a heavier/older child as well as for back carries. (They are also great for a baby, just not as ""cuddly"" as the Moby).After a wrap, my second choice would be a Mei Tai (Asian Carrier) such as Scahi, Kozy, or Angelpack. These are a bit simpler to use and can also be used with infants as well as older children.Also, I've read reports that ""hanging by the crotch"" may not be good for baby's developing spine. With a wrap the baby can be positioned so that their back is better supported"
107755,1,"I bought this for my wife, and she said it is the best. So I am telling everyone that this pump is the best."
146024,0,I bought it when my son was 5 months old. He likes it. But he jumps too hard and sometimes even throws up in it. I was very scared to let him play by himself in the jumperoo because I never know when he will start to throw up. Maybe it's just my son. I'm thinking of returning it and maybe get an excersaucer instead.
62365,1,My son was born in the beginning of January and we've used this every time we go out. It's easy to use and no hastle. Just put the baby in the carseat and merely zip up the two sides. I wished they made something like this to go over a carrier. I can't wait to purchase the Lite Bundleme for the springtime.
40222,1,"I have tried pampers baby dry and huggies, neither worked for my sons. I love cruisers! They keep my baby dry and rash free."
7339,1,"This is a great little blanket, my son loves it. It is a little expensive, but its well worth it. Bright colours and big tags - perfect!"
61348,2,"I agree with the other negative reviews on this item.....it stinks, literally & figuratively!!!!!!! It's just not worth the hassle!!!!!"
103853,2,"This monitor has a serious flaw. Initially, we were using an inexpensive Fisher-Price monitor. The monitor picked up cars going by, sirens, etc and we thought that was too much. But, we heard everything that went on in the crib. If the baby gurgled, we could hear it. We knew when the baby was getting ready to wake up by the rustling. Then we got the Phillips monitor. First off, $200 is robbery. But I paid it. New parent and all. THe monitor has whats called a ""gate"": it doesn't transmit to the receiver until a certain threshhold is reached. What is that threshold? Its your baby wailing. Sure its silent, and sure it didn't interfere with my wireless internet router but neither does the cheapo monitor I use and that silence is a bit unnerving. You can tell whats going on with your baby by hearing its sounds. The lullabies? Cheap dinky sounds like on cheap toys. The lights? useless. The thermometer? Mounted underneath so that you get a reading of the shelf. Parents, use the cheapo monitors and spend the money on something that will actually benefit your child. This is a waste of your time. I returned it after two days. Its much nicer to anticipate your baby waking than to hear it in full distress, wailing away, while you run up the stairs to find tears streaming down its cute little face."
112699,1,"I love these diapers for my son, they give him a lot of movement and no Leaking which is always a great plus! I wouldn't use anything else!"
169852,2,"Only consider this item if you have several hours to devote to assembly. (That's one huge advantage to hand-me-down's-- they are already put together!)We are having problems with the drawer fronts. We consider ourselves pretty good at furniture assembly-- I've worked in a furniture store assembling floor models and my husband is an architect-- so I think we assembled this correctly but it is not staying put together. So far two of the three drawer fronts have come off while using the product. The first came off after 6 months of use and the second after 10 months. The second time, when the right side of the drawer front pulled away from the drawer, a piece of the left side of the drawer cracked off in response. Because the hardware is fault we've had to use glue to try to put this back together. I doubt it will hold for very long."
3278,1,These swaddlers are great and make it really easy to swaddle your infant. We struggled with regular blanket swaddling a few times before moving to these full time. Definitely worth the cost.
111310,1,I received the merchandise in a timely manner; item is exactly as illustrated in the picture and is a mix of both style and convenience. The Bebe au Lait covers are available in many colors/patterns and are not too heavy.
175028,1,"We had this duck bath tub from July to November of the same year. We only used it that long because it acquired holes somehow. I'm assuming the holes just came about due to normal wear on the vinyl around the seams. However, while the duck bath tub was in use, it was exactly what we needed. I didn't need to worry about any hard surfaces and the beak of the duck would ""quack"" which was so cute! We even took the duck with us on vacation, it rolled up so nicely and was perfect!I would recommend this bath tub to be used only for vacationing since it really is not very durable in the long run. A plastic baby to toddler tub would be more suited for a permanent bath tub at home so you don't need to worry about it getting holes and having to replace it a couple of times a year."
141825,2,"My son was able to chew this product off of the crib railing. The adhesive did not stick properly even when directions were followed exactly. When he lifted it with his teeth, the finish lifted too. My railing is ruined and now I have to buy an alternate product."
60545,1,"Looking for a baby tub was a big issue for me. It had to be safe,sturdy and easy to use. This tub is all that and more. My daughter was born premature and as soon as her cord fell out I was able to use this tub safely with her even though she was very small. She is now almost a yesr old and I am still using it to give her a bath. The reclining back is perfect for supporting younger babies, the arm rests supported her upper body while the leg support helped support her lower body and hold her in place so that while I was washing her I could clean her without trying to hold her in one spot. The recline is also perfect for washing hair so that soap and water doesn't run down into the face. There are little cubbies that hold soap and washcloths and cotton balls within easy reach and they are not awkward to get to. Now that my daughter is able to sit unassisted she sits facing the recline. I can still very easily wash her while she splashes and plays and she still has support when it gets slippery. The drain at the bottom is a good idea but I never used it (I just dumped the water into the tub). I liked the fact that it fit snugly into my bathtub, it didnt slide or wiggle around. Storage is easy too, there is a notch in the back that fits perfectly on the towl rack to hang dry. I felt safe using this product and I would buy this tub again. I do highly recommend it to every mother with a baby. It was so much better than the tubs I had with my first two children."
80146,1,"Bought for the 2nd car, easy to use. After 3 boys this is the one."
82613,0,"I liked this product as a smaller, slightly cheaper version of the sleep sheep. The sounds are good quality and don't sound like loops, I can't hear the repetition easily. The volume can get quite loud which is good for an infant and for sound masking, I usually set it to maximum. Overall our child has had great luck falling asleep to the sounds this machine makes, esp. stream and ocean. BUT...The down side of this is that, like another user complained about, there is no continuous play mode. There is 23 and 45 minutes only and a vague ""middle position that appears to be one of the two.The sound cuts off sharply when it's finished its time-out which is enough to frequently wake up our baby, very frustrating! It would be good to, at least, have a fade-out for the timed sound.The battery life is excellent on this product, I'm still using the original batteries after 2 months of lots of usage, so I can't see why they don't have a continuous setting. I would not buy this product again because of that single flaw.So if you have a power-sleeping kid, then this is probably a fine product, but our light-sleeper isn't satisfied. :("
120517,1,"We registered for this monitor when expecting our first son and slept much better because of it. We did experience the false alarms a couple of times but we called the company and they told us how to adjust the sensitivity so that it still detected his movement therefore not setting off the alarm every time he rolled too close to the edge. Though it would be nice if the pad was maybe twice its width, overall it is a great purchase which is why we are asking for another for our second son. (We still use the monitor itself for our toddler!)"
133869,1,My son will be 2 years old this month and he loves this seat. He loves it from the very first time I put him on it. It fits perfectly and is very sturdy. The best!!!
177527,1,"Before my daughter was born, I had already decided to use a breast pump as opposed to nursing. In the hospital, I received a lot of pressure to nurse instead of using the pump. I tried it and it just didn't work out. My feeling was it didn't matter how she received the breast milk, as long as she got the breast milk.I started using the Medela pump the hospital provided and then borrowed the electric Medela Pump-n-Style from a friend of mine. Although this worked well, it wasn't that easy to use in front of company. When we first got home and had a lot of visitors, I always had to go upstairs and pump. I didn't like the double pump system, it made me feel like a cow.I now use the Avent pump and find it much more practical. I am much more flexible with the hand held. I can pack it in the diaper bag and go. I don't have to worry about finding a plug or a private place to pump. The Avent makes it much easier to be discrete.Had I not started using the Avent, I might have already stopped pumping. Now, I am getting 6-8oz in just 14 minuets (7 min each side). This pump has been a life saver!"
20621,1,My son is 8 months old now and LOVES this jumper. When we first put him in it at 5 months he was a little leary of it. Now he entertains himself for a long time on this toy. What is even better is he wears himself out before naptime on it!!!
181384,1,"My husband and I literally spent the first five months of my pregnancy doing nothing but researching strollers, and after going back and forth between Peg Perego, Inglesina, and Bumbleride, we finally settled on the latter. We couldn't be more glad that we did! Though the color is much darker than in the photos (it's more of a sea-green/blue) there is absolutely nothing to complain about. It is easy to put together, easy to operate, easy to clean, and probably the most stylish stroller we've seen. It took me two attempts to get the hang of closing it, but opening it is a cynch- one handed. A friend has the Peg Perego Pliko and after giving it a spin we're SO relieved that we purchased the Bumbleride. It feels a little heavier than you'd think 22 lb might be, but it's not difficult for me to lift (5'6"" /120lb). The construction is solid and the handle adjusts to every height you could possibly want. It's more expensive than many, but worth every penny- and worth every penny you save by skipping the EVEN more expensive ones. Bumbleride has struck the perfect balance. I wouldn't even CONSIDER other options after having tried this one!"
140299,1,"I don't know about animals, but it works great for my dry, cracked skin.Massage it in at night, cover with gloves or socks (depending on hands or feet). Softens skin, heals winter cracks, does not burn or sting, has a pleasant scent ( at least to me)."
71549,1,"This icepack is great! It keeps the milk cold all day long while I'm at work. I bought two to have an extra, but I've been using it in my lunch bag instead! Works better than any other icepack."
123034,2,"I agree with all of the other reviews about this product, in that it was cute and had some neat features (sounds, etc). However, my son is tall and he was uncomfortable with having to sit at an awkward angle. Now for the sound effects: each time that my son lifted the lid to ""go"" it said that he had already gone or made some other ghastly comment and the guard would fall off. Given what I now know, I would recommend that people get a potty seat from the One Step Ahead site- the products have really helped my son and they are so much cheaper then my new glorified stool!"
26450,1,"This was the perfect bassinet for us. It is very sturdy and has a small base making it easy to fit in a small area. It does not rock on it's own like we originally thought; however, either do most other bassinet/cradles. We liked that it did not rock from the base like most bassinets/cradles. It makes it perfect for families with larger dogs. It rocked slightly when locked, but never leaned when our son started pushing himself towards the sides. The music was awful, therefore, we just opted not to put batteries in. We did not have a problem with the sheet. We just used lap pads underneath our son. We had to wash it only once because of him getting it wet, in which case, a pillowcase worked just fine. We are very happy with the purchase and plan to use it with our next child."
177665,1,"Although I haven't been using this pump for very long, I've been able to get very good results. Of course, pumping takes practice but this pump works great for beginners. It is very easy to set up and clean...making it easy to take along. I also like that the bottles fit onto the pump-nothing extra to buy (and clean). I also have an electric pump but prefer this pump when I am home during the day. I find that I can more quickly get it ready and am able to pump one side as soon as my baby is finished nursing on the other side. I definitely recommend having a manual pump, even if you plan on or already have an electric."
58110,1,"My Daughter absolutely LOVES this Walker. It was recommended to me by a friend who has a son a couple months older than my daughter. We bought this for her when she first started pulling up on the coffee table/fireplace (around 8 months). At first she loved the music and the balls... and then she got the hang of pushing it around the floor. Now that she's a year old and walking she brings it out every day and continues to walk around the living room with it. I like it because it's sturdy, has wheel brakes, and keeps her entertained. Also... I feel like this is one of the few toys that has kept her interest over a longer period of time."
34198,1,"Used this for a recent trip, it was very handy! Being able to carry the seat on my back when walking through the airport was much easier, as we have two kids now (an infant and a toddler). We checked the bag, no apparent tears after two flights checking it. It fit our Britax seat perfectly (we even stashed some extra stuff into the bag on the way home like my wife's breast pump. Highly Recommend."
146526,1,"Our baby loves this jumperoo and is entertained long enough for me to get dinner on the table, or do laundry! I wish there were a few more things hanging down from the top, or that the critters moved, just for added entertainment. Also, the music doesn't last very long and I have to keep turning it back on. Our 4 month old does like it though, she just tires of it after about 30 minutes.Overall, it was easy to put together, it's sturdy, and appears to be comfortable for our little one!"
82330,1,"I love how this pillow's belt supports my lower back, giant bonus for this nursing Mom."
161224,2,"I too have a problem with the sling...actually, I have 2 problems. The sling won't stay in place....it snaps in before we start the bath but starts sliding around. My second problem is that the sling is slippery. My son just slides down. One time he slid so quickly that his back hit the grooves that the toddler ring snap into and it left a bruise on his back! I have to place a washcloth over the area to keep him from getting bruised again. I still use this tub because I refuse to spend any more money on an item that is only used for a few months but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."
150532,1,"I couldn't find this product anywhere in stores, and I needed it to be a certain length and width. I was buying it for a cradle my father had made, and the cushion was oddly sized. When I got it, it was the perfect size and it fits great!"
112861,0,"I bought these for their ""gel free"" claim. Let me tell you that the gel makes a world of difference and doesn't hurt baby. These leaked and had to be changed every hr or so.Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Diapers, Stage 2 (12-18 Lbs), 48-Count Packages (Pack of 4) (192 Diapers)are so much better, they close better, they don't leak, they can hold more. In the end I switched to Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers - Super Mega Pack - 5 because of the price. Also, I didn't think my baby needed the ""organic"" diapers much past the 3th month (her skin is less sensitive after that)."
83895,0,"Pros:Keeps food off of the table (usually).Easy to wipe down.Easy to roll up and stick in the diaper bag for travel.Cons:The suction cups aren't very suction-y, and my babers can easily pull it off of the table and throw it, along with his pile of cheerios or what have you, onto the floor.It's a good thing we have a dog."
94412,1,"I love those bottles. My sister-in-law introduced me to them and since that is basically all I bought. They have a very good step by step thing going on which is great. You can interchange nipples and put the sippy cup top on the bottles. I did this when my son was about 6 mths old and it had the holder too which was great. Now that my son is 2 he still uses the sippy cup, since he hasnt been great with cups without a cover.They dont even spill. And now that I'm pregnant again, I am definately getting more of these. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
92084,1,This little pillow has so far helped a lot with my sleep comfort. I am 35 wks pregnant and I was really sick of my belly hanging and making my back hurt when I lay on my side. This wedge pillow definitely works better than a conventional pillow to put under my stomach. It's also great to put in between your legs.
77545,0,"This is a good looking swing. Unfortunately, the look is more for the parent than the child.This swing does it's job and looks cool but there are a more than a few things I'm disappointed with.- The power cord is short, so you have to keep the swing near an outlet. You can use batteries, but it doesn't function as well with the batteries. Maybe it's just the one I got, but when powered by brand new batteries, the lights flicker in the mobile.- The 2 positions are both very reclined - if your baby likes to sit up and look around, this won't do it for them.- Compared to some other swings, the swing speed is slow - if your baby is soothed by rapid swinging - this won't do.- The head rest is not removable. Once my son gets a little bigger, I don't know how well he will fit without it being uncomfortable.- The net is kind of annoying.- It can be a little difficult/awkward to place the baby in the swing, and take them out with the tray attached because of how the swing is built. I leave the tray off for now.I think it really comes down to the needs and wants of your child. I don't regret buying it. However, I do think it looks good but is not nearly as functional as one would think."
152755,1,"From the heavy seats we had before these are great, easy to get in and out. They do not however really attach to the seat, the seatbelt holds the whole seat but I believe that's how boosters work anyway over 30lbs."
107286,1,"With our 1st child, we had a different diaper pail, which still used the regular garbage bags, but it had a fabric twist at the top that soaked up a lot of odors -- it was good, but it wasnt AS GOOD AS THE DIAPER CHAMP! I am so pleased I picked this diaper pail. I agree with other reviews that you have to keep it clean of course -- and the easiest way Ive found so far is to spray it with clorox Lysol, let it air out, and I also use the disposable toilet cloths (scrubbing bubbles brand) and wipe everything down really good each time I take the bag out. I highly recommend this product!"
42166,1,This folding hamper has worked well for us. The mesh bag stays in place well and is easy to pull out. It looks attractive and is a great size for little ones.
156541,1,"I bought this swing when I was staying away from home and my 4 month old was really being fussy. This swing is wonderful for little babies. I liked it much more than the big swings for babies that are under 6 months because it has a much more gentle, soothing motion. Plus it is easy to pack up and take to grandma's house for the day, or just to move with you from room to room. For me it could completely replace a bouncy seat, my son was much happier swinging softly.Once your child is over 6 months and sitting on his own, he'll probably be ready for a more uptempo full sized swing, but before that point this swing is a lifesaver!"
92833,2,"The first thing you'd think of when making something like this for infants/toddlers would be safety, right? Guess not.We laid this thing on a flat hardwood floor and our son couldn't get traction since the cloth slipped all over the floor. So we moved the thing onto a carpet. One of the first red flags that popped into my head when seeing this thing was that you just lay the spinner on top of the cloth; there's no anchor system for the apparatus like in other explore mat-systems where the hard plastic is anchored under the cloth.Well, the red flag was unfortunately justified. On a flat surface, our 4 month-old son still had the misfortune to tilt his body in a way that lifted the spinner up and it then came down on his fingers. Now, I want you to imagine the entirety of your body weight coming down with hard plastic edges on your fingers. Doesn't sound very forgiving pain-wise, does it? We didn't even know what was going on as we'd never heard him cry or scream like that before.Now we're sitting here with a screaming kid and wondering if we should take him to the doc since he goes back to screaming a minute after waking up.Sad thing is that I think he'd really be into this thing but if you can't bother to engineer a product that's marketed towards developing infants but doesn't prevent something like this happening to an infant, then you get 1 star from me. Yeah, it was also bad luck, but that's what preventative engineering is for."
51358,1,"I purchased this stroller in December '05. I currently use it for my 4 year old and 9 month old and we love it! When we first received it, one of the saddlebags for the rear seat was missing -- I contacted Evenflo. They could not send me a new bag for the other side, but were willing to replace the stroller for me. I decided against it since it wasn't a huge deal. The customer service rep contacted me two more times to make sure I didn't need any additional assistance.Up until this month, I've been using my Evenflo Discovery Car Seat in the rear seat. I went to use the rear seat without a car seat and I noticed that the snaps that attach the padding for the rear seat had ripped from the fabric and were permanently snapped into the frame of the stroller. I contacted Evenflo by email on Monday and by Thursday, received an email back. As of Friday, they are sending me a brand new stroller at no cost! The customer service rep called me today and was extremely helpful on the phone.The only thing I don't like about the stroller and my reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that my 4 year old can drag her feet in front of her, so I constantly tell her to pick up her feet. But that's more of a personal thing, rather than an issue with the stroller itself. Oh, and her feet can hit the levers on the 2 front wheels, so that the wheels won't turn. I would suggest to the manufacturer to make them pull up for straight rolling and push down for turning or make the levers smaller/lower so that the front rider couldn't hit them by accident. But other than that, we love it!!!We've never had any problems with wheels either -- just noticing others' complaints. Oh, and our stroller is the Silver Star print, not the Tattersall. But it's still the same frame."
154115,1,"We use these refills for our home changing station. They ""pop up"" out of the refill box. We also use the packages for travel as they have a nice reseal top.These aren't a fancy as more commercial wipes, but they are totally odor, chlorine, chemical etc free and ensure my kids skin stays healthy.Bottom line (pun intended), they get the job done."
170280,1,"I got this for my sister in law who lives with her mother, and as a result has one room for her and her 1 year old and newborn. I bought two of these hoping there would be enough room, and they were perfect! Definitely the crib to buy for those trying to fit at least 2 or 3 cribs into one tiny room. It was easy to assemble and doesn't look cheap. She loves them!"
94024,1,"my daughter had asked for little mermaid bedroom set for her 3rd birthday and now it has been complete with everything, she seems to sleep all night with no problem. thank you."
100887,1,I love Pampers in the day for my baby girl. I actually think they smell better than huggies right when I take them out of the box!
21633,1,"I got this carseat because I loved the look of it and it had a high safety rating. My son was born 10.5 lbs and 21 inches long...he was a moose! He stayed in that carseat until he was 10 months or so with NO problems. The straps still fit him, the only issue was that he got a little long for it and he got so heavy that I didn't want to carry him in ANY carseat, I started using a sling. Not the carseat's fault.The fabric is easy to clean and he was a super spitter! It was heavy but so was he. The carseat also attached nicely in the car and strollers - even the shopping carts at the grocery store.The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 was because as a newborn, my little guy seemed to sit very upright. Not a big issue if you get a headrest for it. Also, the handle is a little stiff but nothing I couldn't handle, and I have small hands.We are now pregnant with twins and I'm looking to get the SAME carseat again."
50995,0,"I bought this pillow during my first trimester (when I first started having difficulty sleeping). It seemed to be a nice replacement to my 5-pillow sleeping arrangements, but didn't work out as well as I had hoped.I tend to be a sleeper that likes to shift from one side to another (to prevent one side of my body going completely numb). This product is fine if you don't move around at night. If you need to flip over, it may be fine during the first trimester, but once you hit the third trimester and your mobility is limited this product may not work so well for you.I think it is a good purchase and not too expensive, but consider your sleep patterns before investing."
68066,2,"While this product did fit our Chico stroller that is on the smaller side fairly well, after two overseas trips it was significantly ripped and damaged beyond effective use.I have other JL Childress products that work well like the car seat bag, but this one product seemed to be off the mark."
17584,1,I have three of these car seats and LOVE them. I believe they are the safest on the market. Easy to install with latch and they don't move once they are installed! I would HIGHLY recommed Britax to anyone in the market - my kids love them and I know they are safe. Best money I have spent on car seats!
123943,1,"I love the snap n' go stroller! It's super lightweight and simple to open up. Your baby's carseat slides right in and you're good to go! It's very secure, and the stroller is very easy to manuveur. I always thought these types of strollers seemed flimsy, but I really love this, it makes it so easy to take the baby out for a walk, to the mall, etc. I definitely, definitely recommend this product!"
164638,1,We use these diapers when we are out and about and cloth diapering is not an option. They work great and are an awesome value!
1807,2,I know many people swear by Pampers and I did find their fit to be very pleasing BUT both of my children had significant allergic reactions to the light scenting added to these diapers. For parents of babies with sensitive skin these may not be the diapers for you.
143736,2,"I wouldn't recommend this product. It's flimsy and not at all warm like I would have thought it to be. It also doesn't fit the Graco Snugride carseat tightly, so it ""falls in"" on the baby's face. I had an old no-name brand car seat cover that was much better. Too bad I let someone borrow it!"
111464,1,We love the extra base for our car seat. It is a great product. It was easy to install and great for first time parents.
107273,1,"six months in -- Well designed. Have had no smell problems. Ability to use regular trash bags is huge bonus. Would buy this item again without hesitation.Update -- Nine months in and have to say that this is not doing a great job of keeping smells in -- the champ has been ko'd. Worked really well though for the first eight months or so. Based on those eight months of use I would still recommend as it is easy to use and the ability to use normal trash bags is nice. Good product, but be mindful of its limitations."
56856,1,"After a 13 1/2 year break, we were blessed to have a fifth child join our busy family. This is the third high chair we've purchased during our 18 years of being parents. It is by far the most attractive, functional, and sturdy chair we've owned. I love the removable, fabric seat cover that is machine washable; likewise, the tray insert and tray go in the dishwasher just fine. Also, even without the tray on, this chair is so great. It has a little bowl area that is perfect for holding little snacks like Cheerio's. Baby is easily placed in and taken out of this chair. I am sad that Eddie Bauer seems to be phasing out this lighter wood chair for a darker one, as this one fits our kitchen so well. Then again, we got it for a steal! We plan to keep this chair for our grandchildren, and feel confident that its structure and unobtrusive, classic, clean lines will stand the test of time. It will probably never leave our kitchen! My only concern is that the headrest area doesn't seem to provide enough padding to protect baby from getting hurt when she arches her back and bumps her head against it - an easy enough fix."
163154,0,"I bought this because I think it is absolutely the cutest mobile out there. But my daughter doesn't find it very interesting, and when you wind it up, the music plays only for a very short time. Disappointing!"
50519,1,"I am just about 6 months along now, and have had a lot of trouble sleeping since month 1. I don't know how I could live without this pillow! I don't think i'm going to be able to give it up after the baby is born! My husband is much happier now too, since I am no longer tossing and turning and waking him up. The pillow does take up a bit of space in our queen size bed, but it has never been in the way for him. Also the cover is really not too difficult to put on, I was able to do it in only a few minutes.Buy this pillow, it's more than worth the money!!!"
60906,2,"At first, I loved the Diaper Genie. I first purchased the product 5 years ago with my second child. Despite the difficulty in turning the wheel and the fact that the knife did not cut very well, it was great for my newborn. As long as I used small diapers, there was no problem in fitting a fair amount of diapers in the pail. When I started using larger diapers, I was emptying the unit, sometimes, as frequently as once a day. While I was breastfeeding, I didn't have to worry about smelly diapers. Once solids were introduced, the pail didn't work as well as needed to contain odors. It didn't stink up my room, but the closer you got to the pail, the more odorous it became. Boy, what a smelly mess it was to empty the pail. The smell permeated the plastic of the pail, and no matter what I used to clean it, the stench remained; even after I stopped putting poopy diapers in it. The blade inside the rotating mechanism only got worse. I am guessing that was the reason that it never turned very smoothly. I am now pregnant with my third child and have not for a second considered purchasing another Diaper Genie. I will consider another product."
155272,0,"I have had to reapply this border on numerous occasions. It just won't stick. I even tried double-sided tape and buying wallpaper glue, but nothing works. It is very cute though and goes beautifully with the set."
71585,1,"I love how small and light the stroller folds. It is very convenient. Being so light makes it a tad flimsy and I have had some issues with struggling to get it over bumps in the road. I would recommend that they extend the basket to make it accessible when the carseat is in place. I had a Kolcraft Universal Carseat Carrier and, though it did not fold quite as small, it was much more durable and user-friendly."
97785,0,"My son actually loves this bottle otherwise i might have switched to something else. It isnt that the bottle doesnt do what is advertised-i found that it DOES reduce the amount of air swallowed during feedings... it is just that you have to have all of the many parts in exact alignment otherwise you either have a leaky bottom or a collapsing nipple. (this means that after each cleaning you are spending a little bit of time putting each bottle back together) That having been said, once we figured out the seal on the bottom sometimes needs to be readjusted prior to feeding (you need to hold it upside downto get in there if there is formula inside), we are 90% happy with these bottles. I do agree that the stage one nipples are sooooo slow that unless you take a pin or knife to the hole you'll spend hours feeding your newborn. (it gets better once your baby is old enough to handle the stage two)I can't say one way or another if we'd do anything differently..the time and rare inconvenience of a spill or inverted nipple is a small price in exchange for a less gassy baby. (and no, they dont leak or collapse everytime...or even everyday...but it does happen)."
72353,1,"These rails turned the bed into a full size bed... but as others mentioned, you still need a support system. First we thought that a box spring would be sufficient, but it wasn't. The whole set (box and mattress) fell to the floor while my son was in bed....I just ordered a metal support system from[...]. Hopefully it will do the trick. I really like the full bed and I want it to work out....Here's the link for the support system. Hopefully it will help somebody...[...]"
32411,1,"We bought this gate because my toddler son figured out how to undo the cheap wood dog gates. We're very pleased so far.Pro:-Looks great in black. Lots of compliments-Wide entry. Others are not as wide-Low step height-Easy install. I didn't even need the instructions (which were missing in one of my gates)-Very secure. My son can shake it and it won't budge.-Requires three steps to open which makes it difficult for my toddler to figure out. 1) Push button on handle, 2) Rotate handle, and 3) Lift gate slightly and rotateCons:-In order for the handle to work properly, the gate requires A LOT of tension on the wall to push the handle closed. If you are not mounting this at a stud, it may very well damage your wall. (It damaged my friend's walls) Without this extreme wall tension, the handle is not used at all and it to open the gate you just need to lift the entire gate and rotate it.-Cost. Must be one of the most expensive, but so far to us, its worth it!"
103820,2,"While I still use this monitor, I only use it as a supplement to my video and cheap Greco monitor. When I first got it, I returned it because you couldn't hear anything, not even the baby crying!! The second one works better, you can hear him crying if there is NO other noise in the room. This is the the highest sensitivity. I kept it because our house has a problem regulating temperature in the rooms, so I liked the fact that I can monitor the temperature in his room at all times. Otherwise, it's not worth the $200.Also, the battery life is a joke. It maybe lasts 4 hours, MAX, off of the cradle. I don't really ever take it off the cradle anymore, and just use our cheap $35 graco monitor when I'm walking around the house. That monitor will last days with the batteries without having to replace them, while the Philips is basically useless unless on the cradle. (It takes a LONG time to recharge). Honestly, what's the use of a monitor if you can't take it around the house with you?"
12897,2,"We share a similar story about this gift set. We were hesitant to buy this, but decided to give it a try. We have tried using it numerous amount of times and still have not been able to hear anything besides a noise that i can only descibe as an airplane over head. My girlfriend is 21 weeks and can feel the baby moving, but cant hear it. Please don't waste your money. It can be better used for other things."
147861,2,"what a disappointment.this hamper looks good in the picture but once i got it home and took a closer look, i was appalled.here's what i discovered:- poor quality weaving. i got pricked a few times touching this hamper. not good if you have children around, they may get splinters.- liner is exceptionally thin- hamper is light, it's unstable, and tips over easily.- both lid and hamper arrived chipped and cracked at the binding. i thought it was the poor packaging, so i exchanged for a new one and the second one arrived just a poorly.the only thing i like about this hamper is its compact size, but for the cost, $57.00, i might as well pay a little more for the sturdier and higher qualitySeville Classics Hand Woven Round Rattan Hamper, Teak, 16 by 23-1/2-Inch."
46646,0,"The only problems I have with this system is that the carseat base does not work properly in my vehicle or anyone elses vehicle that I have put it in. My 3 month olds head leans to far forward when using the base. And yes it is quite heavy, both the car seat and the stroller have weight to them. I'm not weak and I struggle sometimes carrying the carseat and my 13lb 3 month old."
79279,1,"I actually received this valance in the Zanzibar bed set. But, if you need to purchase another one for an extra window in the nursery - do not hesitate. This is a beautiful valance and actually has the same lovely fabrics (including suede like fabric) & textured animals as the bed skirt, bumper, & quilt. I have noticed other bed sets (even the expensive ones) where the valances are quite plain.The valance measure's around 90 inches wide. But, is meant to have a bunched up look so it looks great on narrower windows. Also, beige or sage colored drapes or sheers would be a great complement to this valance to shield the nursery from day light during nap time."
114821,1,Perfect for my 6 month old. She has back support and feels a part of the dining experience. She loves it. We love how easy it carries and sets up.
16219,1,"The blanket is the perfect size, it folds up correctly every time, it is totally comfortable, and washes well...I love it. My children use them in the yard, at the beach....best ever!"
135567,2,"I do not recommend this product for a newborn. It is unsafe, as it is too large and slippery for a newborn. If you are not holding your infant with both hands, they will slip around in the tub too much, and potentially have their head slip into the water in the water in the tub. There is no way you could safely bathe a newborn without two people on the job using this bathtub. If you're looking for a bathtub that you can easily and safely use for newborns, I recommend one with an infant sling. The sling cradles the baby and prevents them from slipping, keeping one or both of your hands free for washing the baby. This product will be returned, and I highly caution any parents against purchasing this product, given the safety issues."
26105,2,We bought this carseat and matching stroller. We love the stroller. Our son is uncomfortable and hot in this carseat. We have recently purchased the Britex Marathon. Hopefully he will be more comfortable in the Britex carseat.
119443,1,"Baby and 1st time mom were having latching problems. I just couldn't manage to keep her in the right position. Bed pillows and other nursing pillows were all too soft, baby would sink too low, or they would push away from my body. My Brestfriend stays in place because you lean against the part that wraps around your back. I put a long throw pillow under it so it won't lose shape over time. It is firm enough that baby doesn't sink too low. Myonly reason for rating 4/5 is I have no idea why it has 2 lumps on the top of the pillow."
117345,1,"I love this gate, it is really good looking and doesn't take away from my decor. I highly recommend it!"
113236,0,"I have wanted one of these diaper bags since my first daughter was born, but never wanted to shell out the cash. I finally gave in when I wash shopping for the arrival on my second daughter.We have been using this bag for 2 months now, and while it is extremely cute and fashionable, there are a few things I would change.1. While the shiny plastic works well for the outside of the bag to be able to clean it easily, it does nothing for a struggling mom with her hands full. This diaper bag is always sticking to doors when I am struggling my way out of doctors offices, etc. It's just annoying.2. The bottle holder cooler only holds a bottle, not an ice pack or anything else, but I have another bottle holder cooler that holds a bottle ice pack, and paci.3. The changing pad should have velcro or snaps to keep it folded. The tie straps are such a pain when you have so many other things to accomplish on a bathroom trip with an infant and a toddler on a long shopping trip day or any other long getaway day.There are plenty of pockets on the inside, but it would be nice to have a few on the outside for convience items.If I had to buy another diaper bag, I would buy a better designed one who kept busy mommies in mind."
38843,1,"We loved it from day 1. We started in the kitchen sink, then moved to the big bathtub. It's so soft and holds in warm water. It hangs to dry and is machine washable - how easy!"
129482,1,"This is my favorite toy and my 5 month old son loves it as well. He loves to grab on to it and chew on it. The circular shape makes it easy for him to play with because you don't have to worry about him holding onto it a certain way to ""use"" it. It is light weight which makes it easy for him to hold onto and fling his arms around."
162160,2,"I picked this item for my registry and actually received it. at first iliked it, but then after a while all of the water would leak, A LOT! this tub seems to only be good to put inside a bath tub. and that is not what i was looking for. i don't think this was a very good tub at all. look for something better."
112577,1,"... they are offering a special deal. Otherwise, you can buy them cheaper at BRU using their $5 off coupon AND a manufacturer coupon."
71677,1,"I have had this blanket for several months now and it is our favorite blanket to use in the stroller. We like it because it is heavier weight, but because it is woven it allows breathability if we have to put it over baby's head. I got it in the aqua color and even after being washed numerous times the color is vibrant, and the edges are well trimmed. Pretty, solid colored blankets are hard to find. This is a great one. I'd love to get it in another color actually. It originally came beautifully packaged with a white silk bow. It would be nice however if it were made in the USA and not in China. I would definitely buy again."

We had tried a couple other covers in this price range like the Bilby and the Clean Shopper, but my son was always not very interested in sitting on those. He'd find a way to try to expose parts of the cart, which would completely defeat the purpose. When we lost one of the covers in a cab, I decided to get a replacement. Then I saw this and loved the pattern and the little toys, so I thought I'd give it a try.And I'm glad to say that WE LOVE IT! Even my picky son! He just loves sitting on the padded cover and actually gets excited to go shopping now! One of the toys squeak and the other plays hula music. Also, the velcro and elastic combination make this much harder for him to expose any of the cart. (The other ones I've tried has either elastic OR velcro, not both.) I've gotten compliments on the cover by other moms and a couple moms-to-be. I am just very glad that I made this purchase because it works great for both me and my son! If you are thinking about getting this, JUST DO IT! ;)P.S. I'm not quite sure what shopping cart cover the previous poster (Amy L. Estrada ""Amy Estrada; Izzy Moon's mom"") was referring to, but I can assure you that this Happy Hula model (which is the one sold and shipped by Amazon) does not say you can use this as a playmat anywhere on the package. I'm not even sure how you could regardless, since it's elasic and doesn't lie flat. She also said she got it at Target, but this isn't even sold there."
61029,2,"I bought this because I thought &quot;I have to have one.&quot; It has been the most aggravating thing I have ever used! You twist and sometimes it twists and sometimes it doesn't and it doesn't take away odor, etc.... I heard the diaper champ is much better,or better yet, just dispose of the diapers immediately and dont buy this at all. I have a whole stack of refills that are sitting on the closet shelf."
120733,0,"As others have said, this gate requires a careful install or it will not open and close properly. I did the ""pressure-only"" style of installation instead of screwing the cups in for mounting. With pressure mounting only, I would not trust this gate at the top of stairs. Even with the screwed-in version, I don't think this would be a good option for child safety since it can be easily opened, even more easily if it is not installed perfectly. If you plan to use this simply as a barricade for dogs who aren't really going to challenge it, this gate is a functional and attractive option."
46307,1,Very sturdy play yard and easy to assemble. Tall enough as well. My only complaint is that I wish it came with one or two more sections as my son finds it somewhat small of a play area. Especially now that he can walk.
38939,0,"I use this when I bathe my child in the kitchen sink. First, it's VERY soft, so it helps to prevent his head ""bumping"" into the sink edges. Because it is so soft, you can manipulate it to fit in the sink how you want it. (Be it more protection for the head as your child gets taller). Drying it is a breeze. Just hook it to your bathroom shower stall and let it drip dry! This also helps keep your baby warm while giving them a bath due to the fact that it's porous, and soaks up warm water to maintain the warmness of it all (as opposed to plastic baby bathers)"
13986,2,"These bottles leak. It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave. They leak. Terribly. And Avent knows it. They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent. Of course the ones they replace it with also leak. Buy Dr. Browns instead."
128441,1,"I love these bottles. My daughter is very picky and would drink out of only Dr. Brown's bottles. When I read that Dr. Brown's (and other clear plastic baby bottles) leached harmful amounts of bisphenol-a into the fluid in the bottle, I bought these immediately and worried about whether or not my daughter would accept them (she is also a reflux baby, so she's just a naturally picky eater due to her tummy problems). She drank more milk than I had been able to get her to take in months, I'm not sure why she loves these bottles so much but I just wish I'd discovered this months ago! GREAT bottles! And safe."
82487,1,I installed this with an infant on the floor and my husband at work - it's perfect. Dont get anything else!
105445,0,I agree with most everybody. It is much cheaper to use this product than ones that take cartridges BUT I don't think that it helps with the odor as much as ones like Diaper Genie. The main reason we bought The Champ was that with the diaper Genie you had to shuve the diaper into the pocket area then twist and with a digestive system like my sons there ends up being more on you than in the diaper.
136173,1,Don't be discouraged from the couple of negative reviews. The exersaucer is wonderful! We bought it when our son was 4 months old and wish we had it sooner. It keeps him so entertained and he absolutely loves it. The noises are not too loud to damage a baby's ears. Putting it together was not difficult but it is time consuming because there are so many toys. It took us about 20 mins. Collapsing it is very simple as well once you get the idea of how to do it. I don't snap it together because I do find that to be difficult. Instead I just carry the different parts. This toy is so great that a friend of mine got one as well and her daughter loves it. I only wish it had another height level because my son is now 6 months old and is about to out grow it. I am now looking for something that will keep him as entertained as this as well as keep him stationary!
6610,2,"I got some of the old style Pampers diapers without drymax at my shower along with every other brand of diaper. I loved the swaddlers,baby dry and cruisers so I decided to stick with Pampers when I finally needed to buy diapers. I bought the size 3 Cruisers with Drymax and they are actually pretty terrible. There is no leak guard in the rear so i'm thinking that's why every time my little boy goes #2 it comes right out of the back of the diaper! Needless to say i'm very disappointed with the new Cruisers. The only thing good about them is they do hold a lot of pee, which is all my baby does through the night, so i'll keep using them for nighttime only. I've had absolutely no leaks as far as pee goes."
69743,1,"The curtains were exactly what I thought they would be and look great in my baby girl's room. I matched them with the green valance and it's a nice contrast and works well together. I love them, and it matches the crib bumper and dust ruffle that someone had given me. Much cheaper than paying $300 for one of those crib in a bag sets that may or may not have contained window treatments."
6171,1,"We're buying our third one of these - it's easy to install, easy to adjust straps, they don't get tangled like others, the velcro holds straps open when putting child in, etc. It's really great."
120804,1,"Like very much, bought because of reviews. Agree it only takes stubbing your toe once to learn to step over threasehold. Easy to open, keeps dogs and/or baby on side desired beautifully. The rest of us can pass through without difficulty. My only complaint is the knobs to tighten frame against door frame are very hard to reach, especially the lower knobs. The older kids tend to stand on frame when in doorway and their weight will loosen the tension knobs, making the gate give way from the bottom. I know this is our problem and not a quality issue, just be aware that it can happen and periodically check the tension on the knobs. But we all agree, it's a great gate and it was a good choice."
172396,1,"I recently bought this seat for my 6 month old son. I was really looking for something where I could bath both my kids at the same time (my daughter is 22 months). Anything to save time. Well this seat is perfect. Now that he can sit up well, I can put them both in the tub and put enough water in there for my daughter to have fun playing around. He loves the bath so much more beucase he too can splash, play, and see everything that is going on. I read a few reviews and there was some negativily about the when you pull the kids out of the seat they may get some red marks on the top of thier theighs, and that has happened. But they are mostly just from movign around and the marks go away right after you take them out. Just as long as you pull them out carefully you will not hurt them. I higly recommend this seat."
169354,2,"I'm looking for a new stroller as I have had this for 5 mths and I've had enough of trying to steer it with two hands (impossible to steer with one hand).The basket is not accessible so I have only used it a couple of times and when I did, objects would scrape along the ground.The harness isn't good as my daughter can wiggle and loosen them in a minute.The adjustable seat doesn't sit upright enough which makes her want to get out even more.The footmuff can only be used by little ones as it seems to be too small (I tend to take off her shoes so its more comfortable).The net drink holder has become my key and phone holder as I wounldn't dare put drinks in there.I love the adjustable handles and rain cover, though!"
17912,1,this item is easy to set up and close. i open it when my grandchild comes and then can close it flat in a closet when he leaves...it is safe as it is not too hard when he falls...
16594,0,"I bought them for $5.00 at the baby sale about a year ago and that was fine, but this new price is insane."
57580,2,"I received this item last night and decided to return it. I had wanted to see one in person before ordering, but Zoopers are hard to find. I had heard good things about the rest of the line, and the picture looked OK, so I decided to buy it sight unseen. In the meantime, I went to the local Buy Buy Baby to test drive last year's Ingelsina Swift, which they have on sale right now. I really liked the Swift, but still hoped I would like the Zooper Salsa when it showed it. It is an OK stroller, but it just didn't measure up after seeing the Swift. Smaller seat, strange removable seat padding, recline is done by unsnapping a few snaps near the hood and is hardly worth doing anyway and a it has a flimsy mesh basket. I think this particular model (which I assume is the 2006) is comparable to the Chicco C6/Capri and MAYBE the Volo. I was so disappointed because I think Zooper as a whole makes great strollers-this model just isn't its best."
130277,1,"One more vote for this big, expensive swing's being worth every penny! We used a smaller, folding, more portable version of this swing before receiving the big one as a gift (from someone I'm now eternally grateful to!!!). This large model is infinitely better.For three months, the ONLY place our newborn would let us put her down while she was awake without crying was in this swing. Even when she was crying and fussing initially, a few seconds of looking at the spinning fish and gently flashing light under the liquid dome calmed her down so well it was a little spooky. Unlike most other swings, the ""seat"" in this one is shaped like an infant carseat, so when newborns fall asleep in it they won't slip sideways or loll their heads over too far. This baby-slumping bothered me so much with the portable model, I was afraid to let the baby sleep in it (which is half the point of a swing for newborns!), but the big swing supports little babies well. Getting this swing seemed like a life-changing experience to me at the time-- suddenly I could cook dinner or take a shower again without another adult in the house to hold the baby!The swing is also great for older babies, though no longer the panacea it once was for my now-8 month old. Some of her earliest sustained cooing and flirting was directed at the fish on the mobile, which she still loves to look at. The swinging still helps ease her into naps when she's fussy.The swing's sounds are surprisingly nice, and there's a good volume control. My husband and I actually enjoy the music (at least for a while), and the ""white noise"" settings are also good. We've been surprised at how long the batteries last (about 3 weeks with daily use at our house). The swing is fairly heavy and large, not what I'd call ""portable,"" but it's still easy to move around the house. The motor is quite audible, as others have mentioned, but once the seat has built up to swinging speed it's not an intrusive noise, more like a blowing fan.I can't say enough good things about this swing. This is one expensive baby item that's truly worth it!"
115633,1,"This is a comfortable and convenient diaper bag. The only problem I have is that the seams tend to get caught in the zippers. This makes it difficult to open pouches or close them with one hand (which is important with a newborn!). Love the insulated pouch and net ""catch all"" on the back."
102649,0,"I found it hard to get this mobile on the crib. I am worried it will fall on the baby! It's a heavy base. I actually used floss to help secure it. I like the mobile, though. It's intricate so I'm not sure how durable it is. My 2 month-old likes it."
149371,1,The hamper is very sturdy.It is also large enough to hold quite a lot of clothes. I would highly recommend it.
149660,1,We purchased our soon to be baby girls crib bedding set and it arrived two days after we ordered it...Amazing!! It was also even more perfect than it appeared online. The quality is wonderful and it arrived in immaculate condition. I will definately use Baby Super Mall as a seller in the future. Thanks!!
53454,1,"I had rec'd a different brand initially as a gift. Exchanged it for this one because of a malfunction in the safety mechanism on the Chicco chair. Love this one...used it on a trip to visit relatives, it worked on all the different tables we encountered. We love the padding on this chair, it's better than the Chicco we had first."
129640,0,"I'm not sure why, but this is the ONLY toy that remains untouched on my daughter's toy shelf at the end of the day. I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old and really starting to like rattles. She is now almost a year, and never throughout her development since then has she been interested in this toy. I do think it's a great idea in theory, very safe and ""soft"" compared to her other rattles, great for teething, etc. She seems to prefer things that have ""something to do"" like rotate beads, or put together/take apart, or buttons to push, etc."
49284,1,"I actually bought two of these products for my pet bunnies. I had hoped it would be large enough for them to be contained and be able to get some exercise. For the most part the pen has done its job. I would have liked for it to have been taller, as my bunnies are able to hop out of it easily. I would have liked for the pen to have been sturdier. One of mine has all ready bent in the middle and as such isn't able to be made into a perfect rectangle. It is okay for containing a small animal, but I don't think it would be sturdy enough to contain a toddler."
81170,1,"Summer Infant Bazooples 4 Piece Crib Set ( Comforter, Bumper, Crib Ruffle and Crib Sheet)My wife chose this bedding set after reading lots of reviews. We were very surprised with the quality for the money we spent ($60).Originally we were looking at sets that cost $160-$200 and after reading those reviews which stated the blanket fell apart after the first wash, we changed our minds.The bumper is reversable which makes it nice. The only down side we have found is that the matching accessories are hard to find (lamp, extra sheets)."
123475,1,"I really like this pack n' play because it is the largest portable out there. Also, it has some cute little toys attached to the walls that keep my little one occupied while she is in it."
83870,0,"This placemat is fine to keep in the car just in case you don't have any of the disposable mats with you. The suction cups worked fine on mine and I just used a wet wipe to clean it up when my daughter was finished eating. Then I rolled it up and stuck it in my diaper bag until we got home. What I didn't like about it was the pocket that sits right in front of the baby. My daughter just wanted to play with it by lifting it up and down rather than eat her food. Solution? I cut it off and then it worked fine. But for the little time that you really need to use this (until your child is 18 months or so and should be able to eat without throwing a plate), I think the disposable ones were a little more convenient."
149865,1,"We got this product for our 1 year old becasue we take alot of long car trips, i went back and forth between this and the hard plastic version and chose this for the saftey rated crash test...it is soft and would just crumble down, where as the hard plastic trays would cause injury. The mesh pockets are nice on the sides and the try is pretty good over all, but it does not sit flat and the items slid back toward the child and fall down through the cracks if they are small..."
14545,2,I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles. I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage. Needless to say none worked. Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles. I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones. First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened. There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby. The bottles are by far not cheap and there shouldn't be so many issues. I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well...too bad they didn't tell me before I registered for them. Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the .99 cent store you don't have all these issues. When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well. I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls. In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating. I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle.
180313,1,"This pump was bought as a gift for my sister. She says this pump is great and better than another pump someone else gifted her. Unlike the other pump, this Medela Harmony pump does NOT hurt her breasts when pumping! Great job on a great product."
144541,1,I highly recommend these bags. I have an in-home daycare so you can imagine what the trash would smell like without them. I used them when my own children were in diapers. They neutralize the orders and has a fresh baby scent. I even use these when I scoop my litter box!
90053,1,We had been using pampers cruisers since my babies birth until she was about 5-6 months old. Cruisers was not holding enough and leaked in the middle of the night as my baby grew older ( even though we used to change it couple of times in the night). Then I went to pampers website to just check if they had more information about there product offering. I found they had different kinds with different absorbency. And we though this one should be ideal and should keep the baby dry through out the note.and after reading numerous other good informative review on amazon we orders this. And thankfully it did the best job it could do.... We went with pampers because of it's soft material which was causing minimal rash to our babies skin compared to other diapers we tried for our baby.
149639,0,"Mattress dimensions are 24""x 38"" not ""36"". Fit my Safety 1st Orion play yard very snug. Perfect fit in width but a little longer than play yard that it makes the mattress buck in the middle. The plastic covering is on both sides of mattress and even with a play yard sheet sounds noisy when baby moves. Its nice to add this to play yard to make it more comfy than the pad the play yard comes with."
151032,1,"It's a strong piece. But personally, I feel a bit pricey for its kind. Definitely a good looking table for the room. Changing table=a must have!!"
18306,2,"There was a time I would have rated this well, probably 4 stars. However, today we had quite a scare because of this product. A choking hazard size piece (fits inside a toilet paper tube) of plastic broke off of the activity star today, the part of the Baby Einstein activity gym that plays music and shows lights. It is one of the round, yellow pieces of plastic where a light would be shown. My 6.5 month old daughter was playing with her activity gym when I noticed the yellow piece on the floor, picked it up, and determined its origin. I'm so thankful that I found it so quickly before it ended up in her hands/mouth. I'm also very concerned that this happened and the ""what if"" that came too close to happening. I filed a report with the CPSC and the company and I'm waiting to hear back."
100625,0,"I had used these diapers before and wasn't too impressed. They are cheaper than the ones I usually get, so I decided to try them again. I should have gone with my first instincts. The ""baby dry"" formula leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion. They are flimsy and not all that absorbent. They might be good for newborns, but they can't seem to handle a toddler-sized ""potty."" They also might work if you change your kid like every hour, or are using them for back-up during potty-training. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend them. Now I have to use up 200 of them - I don't want to give them away if I wouldn't use them myself - since I got them through subscribe and save and ordered a big box. Lesson learned."
100034,1,"My daughter is now 6 months old and has not had a single rash.I started with the newborn size and went through sizes 1 and 2, and we just started size 3.I'd heard so many horror tales about diaper blowouts and leaks, and we've largely avoided them.These diapers have amazing absorption, have kept my daughter's bum dry and they're really light.We've used a few other brands of diapers when these have run out, or borrowed from friends, and nothing else has worked quite as well for us.My only complaint may be that the back could be a bit higher- the few times we've have blow-outs, the poops escaped out the back. But maybe that can't be avoided.I plan to continue to use these diapers."
116922,2,"Just bought that as my baby girl outgrew her previous tub, she's just 2 months old but this tub is such a disappointment, no matter whichvside I use mostvof her body is out of the water so she gets cold and shaky, poor thing. It's too bad because she loves bathing. I used it once and am already shopping for a new one, waste of money! I really don't see how any 1 or 2 year old would be comfy in there."
150303,1,"Lovely color, coordinated very well with the wall color and other decor. Fabric very soft, fit and covered pad completely."
149251,1,This is a great product for pregnant women. The pillow is perfect. I don't think I could sleep without it. I love the fact that it is the same on both sides. I don't need to wake up in the middle of the night to flip it around if I want to roll on my other side. I will probably use it after I have the baby I love it soo much. It will be perfect for nursing.
16965,1,I purchased this bedding for my daughter's portacrib at daycare. She used it for a little over a year. It stayed in great condition despite weekly washings and routine use. I wish her far more expensive home crib bedding had held up as well. This bedding looked so close to new when my daughter no longer needed it that I gave it to a friend of mine whose daughter has been using it for her first year in daycare. I still think it looks great!! Hopefully someone else can use it as well!!
180427,1,I got this diaper bag for my husband as he watches our son while I work on the weekends. He appreciates the fact that it does not look like a purse and is not afraid to carry this around. It only has one insulated pocket on the inside which we use to hold diapers instead of a bottle. It would be nice if it had more smaller inside pockets. All in he likes it and this is the best husband bag I found!
105648,1,"Please ignore any of the bad reviews! This product is wonderful... Let's face it- as cute as they are babies are smelly. If you don't change the diaper pail every few days, it's going to stink. No matter what the brand is. Anyway, the thing I love most about this product is the fact that you can use regular garbage bags. Our garbage bag of choice is Forceflex. They are extremely strong and don't tear easily. It is also very easy to switch the bags. I just wanted to let everyone know that it's easy to use (much easier than the diaper genie)and very convenient.-Jay's Mommy"
11108,1,This product makes meal time comfortable for my toddler and enjoyable for my family. Durable and functional- great deal for the price!
115568,1,"It is well made with a nice weight to it.I am not sure if it is pewter or aluminum.I bought it for a baby shower gift,so I really don't know if they have use it or not."
8464,1,"A lot of reviews say that the stickiness of the tape isn't that great, and it isn't- but so far it's not a problem. The guards are great because we have a fake stone fireplace so the edge is much more uneven than brick, but the guard works great. A definite for anyone with a fireplace and a squishy little handful of a baby :)"
77823,0,"I bought these chairs for my twin daughters to save room in the kitchen. We started using them at about 8 months and they worked out great at first. Now, my girls are 16 months old and always stand up in the chairs. The straps are just not secure enough to hold them down. I'm so frustrated, they stand up at every meal!!"
52882,0,"I bought this item because of all of the great reviews. It is ok. It is soft and I like the music. But my baby really didn't like to just set there. It is almost $50 and she sat in it maybe twice and just cried the whole time. I took it back and got one that bounces too. My baby loves to bounce, it puts her to sleep and anyone with a newborn knows that is the most important thing. I would have given this item 5 stars, if it would have bounced"
135784,1,"I have twins and so we do a lot of bottle feeding. These bottles are great. They don't leak (even when you fill them past the suggested line). My babies have had very little gas and I have to attribute some of that to genetics, but I also think these bottles have a lot to do with it. I highly recommend them!!!"
167262,1,Love everything about this car seat. It didn't take long to arrive; installation was easy; putting my baby in was easy too.
166030,1,great product! I have tried other diapers and my children leak thru. Pampers seem to be the only diapers that keep them dry for the most part. Fast shipping and great price!
32701,1,"I cannot believe I waited until my 3rd baby to buy one of these!! I'd always seen other Mum's and Dad's using them when we were out and about but always thought they'd be really uncomfortable.Well, I finally bought one and tried it with the birth of my 3rd child, (Mainly because I couldn't convince my eldest daugther, 3, to give up her seat in our double pram!) AND I LOVE IT!For me, it is extremely comfortable to use. I've used it for short and long periods (all day) of time and haven't had any problems.What I love about the Baby Bjorn carrier is that it's so easy to use alone. It's easy to strap on, pick up your baby, strap him or her in and off you go. It's also really easy to get the baby out again. The buckles and fasteners are easy to use and adjust as needed.My son loves it - he sleeps in it, or looks around as we walk along. We've used it on walks, outings or just around the house. I also use it when I go with my girls to playgroup. I have two hands free to help them on play equipment and my son gets to see what his big sisters are doing.I would suggest trying before you buy if you do have any back problems as it may not suit you, but is has been a huge success in this house."
33054,0,I didn't expect them to work very well. I must say I did get some relief while using them. I was still in a little pain but that was to be expected. I would recommend that anyone tries them because it may work better for someone else.
116288,2,"This lock was junk. It broke the first time I slid the door open, don't waste you money or get a false sense of security."
110680,2,"First, let me say that I am a midwife and a huge fan of cosleeping. However, this has to be one of the most frustrating products I have ever owned, and certanly the most irritating since I have had my son (who hates the thing because it's rock-hard and won't sleep in it, even at 4 months). My husband and I first assembled this when I was 9 mo pregnant and it was torturous. The parts don't fit together well at all, and to make matters worse, the ""directions"" came completely unorganized, with none of the pages following any logical order / language. It was if they had printed out large 16 by 22"" pages with random directions in all languages all over. Awful.Then today I was trying to collapse it to take it on a trip (it must weigh at least 50+ lbs) and practically broke my back (and all of my nails) trying to get it to break down. When I called customer service (during working hours) i just got a voicemail, and still no call from Arm's Reach.I am sad that this is the leading product out there like this because it really isn't made well. Given the quality of the customer service/ directions they supply to the consumer, it appears that Arm's Reach isn't too concerned."
52370,0,I like the concept of this bag - but I must say that it is not very practical if you have larger breasts. I was never able to get it to sit comfortably around my breasts without it moving around too much or being too tight. I have used it on occassion though for quick trips and it was great for our visits to Europe when we just wanted a small bag for sightseeing outing. In general though I think a backpack would work just as well. I am hoping with a 2nd baby on the way it may get more use.
152648,0,"This came in 2 pieces. All except a few inches from the top was on one piece. The pieces didn't match. One was significantly shorter length wise than the other. We had to stretch it a lot to make it almost line up. The installation was difficult because of this. It looks ok on the wall after the stretching, but still doesn't match up perfectly. I'm sure my son does not care, but it bothers me."
120792,2,"Overall I like this gate, it looks nice and works pretty well, but the latch is made out of pretty cheap plastic. Pieces broke off of the latch in less than a weeks time. Since we have a little baby crawling around on the floor it isn't the safest thing to have small pieces of plastic breaking off and lying around."
134932,0,"We bought 2 sets and my daughter of 12 months did not like it. We purchase NUK Learner Cup and she loves them.If you have to buy, buy one set first and your toddler likes it, then, buy more."
35104,2,"I am a new mom and wanted to do everything right for my new little bundle, spairing no cost. So, I registered for the travel system that includes the stroller thinking that Eddie Bauer had to be the best - especially since it was the most expensive! WRONG! The colors are great and the padding is a plus, but that is the only good thing that I can say about this product! These are my complains in order:1. The straps repeatedly come loose from the back anchors! I mean this is a child safety seat and the straps won't hold him in when conditions are good! How the heck is it going too perform under tramatic conditions? Each time I strap him in I have to secure the straps in the back.2. The canopy is completely useless! In fact, I do not hesitate to say that it in itself is a safety hazard. The canopy will not stay up unless you hold it with the handle. It falls down and drags the ground to the point that you are actually tripping on it if your not careful.3. Poor quality fabric - the cover is begining to rip where it covers the front of the carrier.4. There is a certain way you have to secure the straps in the front, but once you know how they go it isn't too much of a problem.Folks, I have a degree in Safety (no joke). If you are looking for a fashion statement than this is your carrier. If you are interested in protecting your child than I would look for other options."
106417,1,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!) and it even takes the same bags as my kitchen trash can, shich is super convenient, and cost efficient as I can buy them in bulk.The only reason for not rating it a 5 star was that I did have one small problem with it. The foam gasket in the barrell which keeps the poopy smell inside the unit ripped somehow, and it got VERY stinky. HOWEVER, I contacted the manufacturer though their website, and received an email back the same day stating that this was unusual, and that replacement gaskets were on their way to me. They arrived inside of a week and after replacing, it works great again! (They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!"
175854,1,"This is my third carrier. I have a peanut shell, a baby bjorn, and now the baby k'tan and the k'tan wins hands down. The baby bjorn is nice, but my baby always looked uncomfortable in it. The peanut shell was great when she was a newborn, but really strains your back and shoulders. I love that with the baby k'tan the weight is distributed on your back so it's very comfortable. My baby loves it. I was going to buy a Moby wrap, but after seeing my friend putting it on, it just looked like such a hassle, so I decided to buy the baby k'tan. This is a great carrier, you won't be disappointed."
93599,2,"My daughter loves to use her ""little potty"" but this design disaster leaks all over the floor and consequently all over her pants almost every time she uses it. I thought I would only have to clean the floor and her pants if she DIDN'T make it to the potty. This thing is going in the trash as soon as we get a replacement."
166642,1,It's so good item. But I bought 2 box and it's so much for me. Because my baby grow so past. Please order 1 box. That' better.
13539,2,"I have a fairly common Graco crib, and these rail things don't quite fit. They pull off at the slightest tug. In fact, my toddler was injured when he tried to pull himself up on the crib rail to see his baby brother. The crib rail protector came right off in his hand and he slipped, knocking his face against the side of the crib. Forget it. It's safer to just let the baby chew on the rail."
137554,1,"I bought this as a gift for a 2yr old. My review will simply be a recap of a text message between the mother and myself.Me: Hows the ladybuy working out?Her: I have to bring that damn thing where ever she sleeps at night. Even when she goes to her grandmas, hahaha. She loves it!So apparently its awesome and kids will love it."
147484,0,"So far the BabyBjorn Baby Sitter has been great. My little one will sit in it and bounce away contentedly as long as he is feed and changed. The only complaints I have is that is not as easy to change from one position to another as I would like and it is advertised as being small enough to fold up and travel with. While it folds down nicely for travel, I was looking for something a little smaller and more compact for greater ease of being able to carry the baby and the sitter in somewhere on my own."
139939,1,"A little embarrassed that I thought I needed one of these, but after too much looking around for one that would fit the opening where our sliding patio door used to be, I went with this one. It's actually pretty nice. I'm probably going to do some modifications to make it a little more compact for storing, but it's doing the job and looking good."
47176,1,"I have three kids and have used this stroller for over 2 years.1) The tray is near impossible to get off and after a while you will grow to hate that tray and might not even use it.2) Not a quick in and out of the car stroller. You have to fight it a bit.3) Does not recline enough for a nap for your baby and the seat is not very padded. I am getting ready to purchase the extra pad for it online. Oh, When the seat in reclined the older child has very little room to sit.I have plenty of good things to say about the stroller but I figured I just give the negatives b/c you probably already the know the good things."
148462,1,I don't know what the others are talking about. I just bought this and had no problems whats so ever! I love the whole design of it and the whole crib bedding. I have had nothing bad to say about this at all. Maybe the others need to wash this on a gentle cycle.
95029,1,"I bought this pump for my wife. She absolutely loves it. The first time we used it, it honestly wasn't doing anything except vibrate. So we were concerned it didn't work. Then we tried it again a few minutes later and it's fantastic. Not good for only breast feeding babies, but for supplementing with formula it's great. Need to spend the extra money and get a double pump if You want to breast feed full time."
55759,1,"I decided to give this product a try based on the reviews and the low price. It was well worth it! As a first time Mom, I quickly discovered how long it takes to warm up a bottle running it under hot water. It's especially not fun when it's 3 a.m. in the morning, baby is crying and I'm half asleep. When I got this bottle warmer our world improved greatly. Both my husband and I can't imagine not having this bottle warmer. It steams the bottle up quickly and evenly. I usually pre-measured the water and have it ready for the next feeding. I would put this on my list of top 5 must have baby products and will be one thing I always buy for baby showers from now as a gift."
6745,0,"The new pampers cruisers use new inside soft net like liner which first I thought would be great but they're not at all! They leave quite a lot of white lint on my son's bottom. I'm not alone in this case, a friend of mine has exactly the same problem for her daughter! Caution should be taken if you have a baby girl because the lint might get inside her private area. I really liked the old cruisers and I want them back!"
121384,0,"This walker was hard to assemble. It falls apart easy. At the same time, when we take it to the babysitters house, we cant get it to collapse properly, and end up re-attaching the legs when we get there. The legs are constantly popping off when Baby is playing in it. This walker is so giant, there is no way for Baby to walk around in it. She mostly scoots a few inches around. She does enjoy looking at her feet thru the see-thru plastic tray. This walker is truly a mess and I dont recommend it."
160278,2,"We bought this product because we only received one swaddling blanket from the nurses at our hospital. Plus, we figured that our son would not be able to wriggle out of something with velcro attachments. Boy were we disappointed. This blanket is so large and so loose that he can get both arms and his legs out of it in a matter of minutes. The regular size seems to have been designed for a 6 month old child, while the large seems to have been designed for a 1 year old! (i.e. up to 22 lbs!!!). This makes NO sense whatsoever as babies only like to be swaddled for 3-4 months at most. Who on earth designed this product? Do they know anything about babies? Our son thrashes about freely in this wrap even though he is only 9 weeks old, and in the 95th percentile for size! We have since learned how to wrap a swaddling blanket tightly and our son goes to sleep within minutes in the blanket, while listening to his soothe-a-sleep bear. I can't believe we wasted our money on two of these things. Maybe I can use them as cleaning rags ..."
42191,0,"I loved this hamper when I got it. It holds just the right amount of clothing and I love the mesh insert. Being able to just pull it out on laundry day is great. It looks very cute and it can be folded for storage. However, now that my son is very squirmy, I find that I don't like the cloth cover that hangs over the front. It's difficult to move and throw clothes in using only one hand. The cloth cover is usually just hanging in the back leaving the hamper open so that I can easily put his clothes in. Also, he was able to pull off one of the buttons! I think I will be buying a new hamper with a hinged lid."
176774,2,"I really did not like this. We had a warmer that submerses the bottle in water, and we found this worked faster and better. We got this as a second hoping to use it upstairs at night. Decided to just buy a second warmer that uses water, and to use a cooler for the bottles (our baby needed 4 anyway to get through the night)"
138087,1,I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old. He absolutely loves it and it does light up his whole bedroom ceiling. My only complaint is that when it arrived from Amazon the batteries were dead. If it would have come from a store shelf I would understand but thought it was strange coming from a warehouse. Also within a month the batteries were dead again. He does turn it on a lot but I don't think it is on enough to die that quickly.
31238,1,"After the nanny confused the clean and dirty dishwasher baskets of baby bottles, I bought this item. Since then, life has been a breeze on the bottle front. Clean bottles and breastpump parts go on the rack to dry and wait for the next use. No more confusion over what's clean and what's dirty! It takes up very little space and was easy to assemble."
17612,2,"Despite the many positive reviews on the ColicCalm website, this product doesn't work for me. My baby has Acid Reflux and I tried ColicCalm unsuccessfully on three occassions and all I got was a pile of black stained clothes. As the reviewer before me warned, be sure to put a bib on your baby before giving this to him/her because this stuff does stain!"
92019,1,"I bought this for the car seat thinking I'd need it. Went over to the car seat clinic and they said that the car already had this feature built in. Meh. For as inexpensive as it was, I just gave it to them. So double check your car manual. If you hear the seat belt click when you feed it back in, you don't need this. And go to a car seat clinic- they are awesome!"
58611,1,"Who needs to watch the pot boil when you can sterilize your equipment in 5 mins? This microwave sterilizer is fast, clean and efficient. You can sterilize just about anything in it from bottles to pump parts, from feeding equipment to bottle brushes. The plus is that you don't get the lime scale on your equipment that you would if you boil stereilzed.This sterilizer fits all size bottles.If you use bottles for your young baby, you need one of these sterilzers.A great shower gift!"
132311,1,This lamp is a nice addition to my sons room. It matches his bedding perfectly. The shade is a tad smaller than I expected but overall nice.
65710,1,"I bought this mobile when my daughter was only a couple of weeks old. She is now 10 months and she still loves it! I love the light display on the ceiling and the fish are cute. The reason I have only 1 small complant, the first time you start it for the night (at least with mine) you have to push the button on the mobile the remote will not work. The remote then works after that. I do not know why that is but it seems a small inconvenience for as much as my daughter likes it not to mention I am there putting her to bed anyhow... A couple people did not like that the fish move slow. I think the speed is fine you are trying to sooth you child not get them all jazzed up, and if they went much faster I think the light show in the ceiling would not be as nice. It sound like a couple of people got duds which is too bad because my family really enjoys ours. I find myself drifting with the lights with my daughter if I stay in to rock her. I have used this product for 10 months not every night but most of the time I have had to change the batteries only 3 times. I love it and hope it continues to give us a good show for at least a couple of years! I recommend and and plan on giving it as a gift to friends with babies on the way."
95522,0,"The hooks that came with this hammock were too thick and very damaging to your walls. It's able to hold a lot, but the net is still pretty flimsy. It's not worth $8."
100593,0,"Somehow they hold less then same size Pampers Cruisers, other then that - good product."
38135,0,"Great backpack with pockets for things, but simply too small. We're probably going to keep it to use as a light hiking backpack."
130937,0,"Ordered wet ones antibacterial cloths and thought the price of $5.35 was for more than 1. Was surprised that the order contained only one. This is overpriced and deceiving because the advertisement says 5- 3/4 x 71/2, white , 40 wipes per dispenser. Makes it look like more than one. Could have bought this at a store for $2.49. Previously I bought wet ones from amazon contained 5 at a decent price. I will be more careful in ordering. Wet ones are a great product and I like using it in my office when a sink is not available. Just not a good price."
38856,1,I loved this bather for my daughters sponge baths when we first brought her home. Then for her first real bath I tried using a plastic tub...I have never been so insecure in my life! She slipped all over the place. For her next bath I used the Safer Bather in my bathtub and it was great. She is completly secure and comfortable. My only problem with it is it smells. I tried washing and drying it only to have it stink again 3 baths later. I have a well ventilated place to hang it so I don't know what else to do. Also I have noticed when she puts her head to the side her ear is in water. All that said it is still better than having her slip in the plastic tubs.
101928,0,My son only likes this toy a few minutes at a time. He isn't really into playing with it to much. He chews on it a bit then throws it away. But it might just be his preference
19813,2,"First, the adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least. Second, it is opaque, so the kids couldn't even take in their surroundings. Since it resembles a parachute, the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the *stupid* thing wouldn't stay attached to the stroller, the kids probably wouldn't have had fresh air. Go for hats and sunscreen/protective garments instead!"
2624,2,"This is the worst diaper we ever tried. After my 20 months old daughter go to bad (changing diaper at 9pm) we have to change it at around 4am, otherwise she (her outfit, bad and comforter) will be totally wet by the morning. We had no other diaper with such an experience. During daytime it is even worse, sometimes it start letting thru everything after few hours. We use 5-7 diapers a day whereas we needed only 3-4 from cruisers. This simply have not enough absorbent to stay dry for 12 hours (as advertised)"
96542,0,"In comparison to the others that are alot cheaper, I would not recommend buying this style. Even though you can unzip from under the babies chin down, and it is quite warm, my little one did not like the fact that the fluffiness around his head kept him from seeing side to side. I tried my best to fold the whole head area back but he could not see out of the thing."
6510,0,"I also ordered for the $30 coupon code. Anyone get it yet? As far as the product goes, I love cruisers much better than anything else. No leaks, even at night. The stars reflect the lateness of the coupon code, the product itself would get 5 stars from me."
30701,2,"Was good for the first few months and then started losing battery power. Then at about a year, stopped working completely. With a new baby coming we are having to buy a brand new monitor. We will probably be forking out a little extra money this time."
36341,2,I bought this item thinking that it would be necessary with a newborn. It was not needed at all because my carseat (Graco) came with one that attached to the carrier itself. A waste of money if you ask me. Buy a carseat with the right gear and this is totally unnecessary.
85220,1,"I basically love this pillow. Since I got it, I have been sleeping well. I started looking for such pillow because I could not sleep at all. I got the pillow when I was 4 months pregnant. Without the pillow, I could not find a position that was comfortable enough. The pillow provides support in the right places and keeps me comfortable.The pillow is a bit to flat under the head, but I put another pillow beneath, giving me just the level I need. It also takes me some time to get in and out from the pillow, but that is not a big problem.Also, my husband has some back pain and he has tried this pillow a few times. He liked it too."
85717,1,"We went without a changing table for several months as we were reluctant to buy and store yet another piece of furniture, but our aching backs said changing the baby on the floor was for the very young. The changing table arrived in great shape - it was packed well and there was no damage that we found. The wood stain is dark and pretty. Assembly was very easy. We opted to not install the wheels as we have wood floors and the locks on the wheels are not enough to keep the table from moving around while you are trying to change the baby. The table is very sturdy without the wheels. The padding leaves much to be desired, but the baby only stays up there long enough for a diaper change, so I wasn't expecting a Sealy Posturepedic mattress. My only misgiving is that the shelves are exposed, and no matter how I arranged the baby's supplies, it still looked messy, so I bought baskets to help disguise the chaos. For the price of some nice wicker baskets, though, you can come pretty close to the price of a changing table that is enclosed."
47551,1,"Love this mini-co sleeper! I spent days, hours looking for the ""right"" option for us for our first baby. We live in a 2-story home, we don't like a lot of clutter and wanted to have a bassinet option for our son to sleep him for the first few months.After seeing our friends standard size co-sleeper (same company) we decided that was WAY to big for us and would totally take over our master bedroom (we already had to make room for a glider that we bought). The mini-sleeper is great! We never did hook it up to my bed. Just rolled it right up next to my side of the bed (mesh side) so I could hear my son breath etc (you know how you check your newborn every minute to make sure they are alright).The pros:-like the wheels and the fact that they lock ( I could wheel him in the bathroom when I showered when he was really little and my husband went back to work)-mesh side so you can peek right in without getting up out of bed-pockets on both sides of sleeper (we stuck binky's and also the sound generator-we took it out of our sheep)-the zipped storage on the bottom for blankets, jammies etc-high enough so that our large mix labs could see and smell baby without ""touching"" him-waterproof pad (we still tucked a nice blanket over the pad which worked fineCons:-it' not the easiest thing to put togetherMy son is now almost 4 months. It's amazing how he's grown but he's stil sleeping in his mini-co sleeper in our room. We are transitioning him to his crib this weekend (not because the mini is too small).The best thing we brought for our son to sleep in!! We are hopefully planning to have #2 and this will be perfect again!PS: I did breastfeed my son but just found it easier to keep it as a bassinet rather than attaching it to the bed. Easier to get in/out of our king bed withOUT the mini attached to the bed. And it's like 1/2 a step to get up and grab them from the mini sleeper to feed him."
99675,1,it is an excellent item and fast delivery brand new good quality for a excellent price i really appreciate it
180464,1,Product arrived as stated in great condition; haven't used it yet but it looks great.My husband was happy to have a more masculine looking bag.
148121,1,My one month old son enjoys being in the bouncer. I use this mainly after a feed to help him digest and burp. This bouncer has a good cushioning which makes it comfortable for the baby. I saw similar ones but were expensive. The removable toy bar is easy to detach. Am really happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this purchase
50896,1,I love this pillow! I sleep with it every night and I sleep SO good now that I have it. I highly recommend this pillow. But I do suggest that you get a pillow cover since the pillow is white and it dirties easily. :)
80879,1,"Love this product, it is perfect for my little one. The pillows provide excellent support on each side for younger children."
126502,0,"The Huggies snug and dry and not as soft as the little snugglers, but they do seem to hold urine better. However, both my three-month old and my twenty-two-month old soaked through the diapers several times overnight. Several times after I threw the diapers in the trash I found an inch of urine in the trash can. Think I'll try the Pampers baby dry to see if I have the same problem."
26291,0,"I had a very hard time closing the zip once I put my large Brittax Marathon car seat in the bag. At one point the zip started to split, but I was able to fix it by opening and reclosing it. However, the car seat made the journey unscathed (4 different flights) which was the only reason I bought the bag. So all in all it served it's purpose."
56114,1,"This gate works very well. My 5 year old can open and close it easily, but my 2 year old cannot. It can be opened/closed easily with one hand while holding a baby with the other. We mounted 2 of them, one at the top and one at the bottom of the stairs. We've used this gate for 2 years without any problems.When installing, don't use the screws that came with the gate. Use 1-1/2"" galvanized screws instead. Pre-drill slightly narrower holes about 1"" into the studs before screwing. If you run into a metal plate just underneath the drywall while drilling (common in newer homes at the corners of walls), stop drilling and take a sharp and somewhat thick nail and hammer it gently through the metal plate, just far enough to puncture a hole that the drill bit can fit through, then continue drilling. When tightening the screws, you can use a cordless screwdriver, but stop just before it is tight, then tighten by hand with a Philips screwdriver so as to not break the plastic. From start to finish, it took me 2 hours to install and that was with my 5 year old ""helping"" :-)After installation, if the gate is difficult to open/close and doesn't seem to drop into place or lift easily, retighten the bottom hinge bolt: if it is misaligned it will catch on the plastic rod and stop sliding. Use crescent wrench or pliers to hold the bolt firmly (not too tightly or it will crush the threads), then use the wrench included with the gate to tighten the nut. Also, rub candle wax on the locking bolts and edge of the locking trays, so that the bolts slide easily into the trays. A little WD40 on the hinge sliding mechanisms helps, too."
150616,0,"We bought our first Schwinn jogging stroller when our oldest was 6 months old - May 2003. It was incredible! It lasted until summer 2010 with our third daughter in it. Unfortunately I think some of the offroad hikes finally got the best of it and we had to retire it. Having loved the first Schwinn we were sort of fans of the brand so wanted the next one to also be a Schwinn. Overall this Free Runner does as it says it will and provides a comfortabel ride for daughter #3. What I miss about the older version was the built in rain shield, the covered compartment as part of the cup holder feature and the slightly smaller build. This Schwinn is bigger than the older one and honestly feels a bit less sturdy. We won't be using this one for too many off road hikes and instead will stick to using it for jogs on pavement and visits to the weekend soccer games. One plus is the adjustable handle and the drink holder for the rider."
62275,1,"After A LOT of research on crib mattresses and seeing a lot of reviews that even the ""better"" ones had issues of sagging, I *finally* found consumerreports.org crib mattress buying guide. This one met all the qualifications - inner springs had a gauge less that 15, had the border rods, multiple layers of cushioning, etc. I had previously gotten a cheaper foam one not knowing all that was involved and it was cheap for a reason - may have had good reviews but I could smash it down to nothing with one hand very easily. I wanted something that will support a baby for a long time, not sag or create dips. This one is very firm - laid on it myself. Just got it but already think it's worth the price - seems like it will give good support and last a long time."
3232,1,"My daughter just turned 2 months, and I just discovered these blankets 2 weeks ago. She only sleeps when swaddled, and we were using regular receiving blankets to do this....which always concerned me in regards to suffocation risks, and she was demonstrating her houdini-like quality and breaking free in her sleep, which would wake her up. The velco is VERY strong. It keeps her covered and warm (we have both the fleece and cotton types), confined and asleep.....and safe. The flaps fold over the shoulders just right, so that the cloth is secure and away from the face. You only have to un-do the bottom pouch to do nightime diaper changes,keeping baby warm and snug, so they can easily return to sleep."
104289,1,"My cat loves to climb on the stove and countertops in the kitchen, which is annoying because it's so unsanitary. Since she loves to climb and jump on/over everything, I thought it would be impossible to find a gate that could keep her out. Well, I found one! And I love that I'm able to walk through it instead of having to walk over it! I highly recommend this gate. It was also easy to install."
150658,2,"This dresser is really cheap and poorly made. It has wood veneer, but is made of particle board. The drawers are really cheap and will break soon. On a positive note, this dresser looks pretty good, and is inexpensive. You get what you pay for. If you are looking for decent quality or good quality, do not buy this dresser. If you want cheap that looks decent, this is an ok dresser."
53701,1,"Having 3 grandchildren with the need to use a highchair when we have a family get together, I thought what a great idea for extra seating. When they arrived I tried one out. It worked great. One problem; I then purchased a new table. My new table had an edge that hangs down under the table, about 4 inches while my other one was flat with no edge. The chair would not unscrew far enough to secure it to the table. Also if your table is curved on the ends it is harder to make it work. Try the sides. I highly recommend this chair if you have the right table."
104714,1,These solved the problem perfectly. Our child uses them instead of squeezing the juice box and squirting all over. Highly recommend.
45404,1,"This play mat is really superb. It could be a little softer for tummy time, but then again, it will make your baby lift up her head! It really inspires reaching and grabbing and movement. I have watched my five month old go from looking to reaching to starting to roll. She really loves this mat/gym/thing. The music switch sticks a little, but I love this item."
86610,1,"I bought this product after reading the reviews and it really met the expectations.- It is pretty, so it makes potty training attractive outside home. She wanted to keep it or to leave it for someone else to use afterwards!- It is wide, so her little hands don't touch the toilet. When I used toilet paper, it is difficult to cover the sides.- It has two stickers to afix it, but I have to say, I was expecting something different. I thought the whole surface sticks, but it is only two parts that stick. But it is really sufficient, much better than what I expected, which would be difficult to manage in a hurry!Well, simple product that works. I plan on having these for a long time with me and my daughter!!!"
12656,1,"This was the second Evenflo gate I have purchased, the first one now about 14 years old still in good condition. The gate expands with little difficulty and is high enough for keeping my Alaskan Malamutes in specific rooms. The gate is easy to clean. It is also a nice height to keep our toddler grandkids safe, away from stairs. The price is well worth the durability and function."
16875,0,"A pain to put together....it sucks that you pay full price for a product but have to do all the work to put it together. So many pieces to this, was easy to do but cumbersome. This product does hide away well but the hinge area is going to damage the mattress without a doubt as it's bulky. Latches are not perfect each one causes me issue each time we use it. But it does work eventually and provides safety as it's supposed to once all is in place."
102080,1,This rug is exactly as pictured and is so cute. Perfect for our baby's room. Well made and durable.
18881,0,Some of the holes weren't drilled in far enough and there was a HUGE crack in the wood frame and the color isn't very even.
44151,1,"i thought this would fit better than it did on my faucet, and i have to remove it everytime we use the shower instead of the tub. I guess if i had the perfect faucet for it, it would be great. All in all, it's very nice though, easy to get on and off really and it covers the hard faucet so my daughter doesn't get hurt on it. I like it and would get it again."
69618,1,This play yard is really better than I expected for the price. Only problem we had with it was closing it back up after opening it. There is a hidden hinge that we could not find to get it to fold flat. After some careful examination my husband was able to close it back down to fit into the case. Otherwise we are extremely pleased and it will be perfect for our grandson.
171885,1,"Handy tub. Fits well in the kitchen sink for my newborn. The sling is soft and comfy. The only issue we have is space for it to dry, but if you have a large tub or live in a warm area you wouldn't have a problem with it."
169945,1,"I'm really pleased with this crib. The price was right and it arrived within a matter of days. Shipping and handling costs were very low. A few dings here and there and the directions were a little hard to follow. Otherwise, it looks great and is very sturdy. Great crib for the price!"
98487,1,We bought this for our son's family use. His wife said it was posh since it was so totally automatic and easy to use.
6835,1,"Great product! No leaks. Absorbent. Stretch waist band to fit. Price beat Sams Club. Delivery time was fantastic (within a week of order placed on the weekend)! My son has always been in the 25% in height and around 50% in weight. Recently, he has slimmed up but Pampers Cruisers are still our choice. Sure they cost a little more than the other name or store brands but for his comfort and the leak protection, Pampers can't be beat. Occasionally, in the mornings, I have found that jelly-like residue on his skin, but this only occurs when the diaper is very full. Full to the point that the other diapers leak."
51587,0,"I bought this item and theMiracle Blanket - Periwinkle Blueat the same time. Initially, I thought the SwaddleMe looked easier to use and was clearly was cheaper, but I find that I am using the Miracle Blanket almost exclusively. The two velcro tabs on the SwaddleMe are harder to manipulate than I thought they would be, especially with a struggling baby, and swaddling several times a day. In my opinion the Miracle Blanket is overall simpler to use. The Miracle Blanket accommodates all sizes, so it can adjust to baby's growth, and may be a better purchase/gift if you don't know how big the baby will be. Both of these items leave room for baby's legs to move, which is good. (Supposedly, restricting leg movement puts the baby at risk for abnormal hip development.) Don't forget Dr. Karp's DVDThe Happiest Baby on the Block - The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Baby Sleep Longer (DVD)because swaddling is only one of several steps to calming your baby. This is my second baby and so far, it's been a much better experience than with my firstborn. I didn't know about these techniques back then and my first baby's constant inconsolable crying made me absolutely miserable."
89049,0,"Overall the Pampers Baby Dry diapers are pretty good. They are a good price compared to Swaddlers or Cruisers. The big bummer is that I find the tabs don't stick well & tend to come undone at times, creating leaks. I used to get these from the Amazon Warehouse Deals, as they were a good price, but the customer service is HORRIBLE. I was sent a box that had been urinated on (I'm guessing by a dog) and returned to Amazon. They then sent it out as a Warehouse Deal. I don't need diapers that have already been pee'd on!"
46741,0,"Its a decent buy. My daughter who is 4 months old loves to have a nap in this swing. Other than that the mobile hung over is too high for the baby, she can't touch it and the music is horrible."
20520,2,"I loved the Jumperoo with my first two sons,and I would give it five stars until today! Today it broke and my third child ended up on his head hanging upside down. After several babies and storing in the attic, the straps that hold the fabric seat all broke at the same time. Just watch out and check your straps."
30727,1,"Just purchased this monitor at the babies r us store. I bought two units because I have a 2 yr old and an infant. We labeled each monitor on the front. They are clear as a bell and no static or other breakthroughs. I have had 3 monitors in the last 2 years. The angle care monitor- we could hear our neighbors, and the security 900 has so much static its annoying. This imonitor is well worth the money and it really is crystal clear. It takes some time to get used to the clear sounds of your child without the static, but oh so nice...."
20523,1,"This is the best investment anyone who has an infant could make. My son is 11 months old, and has used this since he is about 7 months old, and he absolutely loves it! He jumps his little heart out, and it keeps him very content and occupied for a good amount of time! He laughs and screams and yells and sings the whole time! I would recommend the Jumperoo to everyone!"
178083,0,"I had wanted to put this on a wall but did not look at the dimensions prior to ordering. The letter is very small, but quite detailed and will now reside on her nightstand."
182995,1,"I don't have a baby but do have lots of small items that I wash in my dishwasher. I looked everywhere for a container for my dishwasher that was made of plastic NOT plastic coated metal which rusts when the plastic splits, usually after a short period of time. This one fits the bill perfectly. The holes are small enough to allow for a good wash without the items slipping through the holes. I have had this model for 3 years and there is no sign of it deteriorating."
159484,1,"Our baby girl (now 8 weeks) really loves this bouncer. The running dog fascinates her. Obviously, after some time, she gets bored of it and needs to do something else but after about 7 weeks she still enjoys it at least once a day."
8431,2,"While this product works as long as it is stuck to the table, the trick is getting it to STAY stuck to the table. The adhesive is terrible, and nothing else helps to keep it on. I assumed that I would ruin my table by sticking these on, and I was right. My baby's favorite pass-time now is removing the ""bumper edges"" and chewing on them. I would invest in the expanding elastic edge instead - kids still pull it off, but at least it won't ruin your table."
10697,1,"This is a great product, holds everything perfectly. I don't know what I would have used if not for this product? It's great!"
145318,1,"This is a ""must-buy"" for any baby who is ready to start using their legs! My 5-month old daughter has loads of fun in her Jumperoo and loves the wide choices of toys. Once she gets to jumping, she doesn't want to stop. I highly recommend this product."
65177,1,"The ""tan swirl"" color is much nicer in person than the picture. I was concerned that it was too light of a color, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. This Britax car seat is very easy to install, very solid, small enough to buckle into a smaller car. The seat belt straps are a bit rough against my son's neck, so I would suggest buying some padding. Overall, as usual, Britax has made an excellent car seat."
142649,1,"What I liked:Firm and has kept it's shape. Provides support for the back. Like the pocket. Great for just having baby sleep in one's lap while reading a book. Simple to adjust the straps.What I didn't like:Could only use it in the cradle-hold position. Had to use pillows for all other positions. Depending on your body's proportions, you still might need a pillow placed under My Breast Friend to bring the baby high enough to the level of your breasts - I did.Great for use while sitting in the bed, on the floor or in a nursing chair but not in a regular recliner/lazyboy - the front slopes up because of the chair's incline.Why the four stars: Overall, would buy it again even though a bit pricey. I had the navy-blue fabric with white flowers - the color bleeds a fair amount initially, beware!Take it to the hospital with you. And if this is your first time, please see a Lactation Consultant/attend a local La Leche League meeting."
154146,1,"I love these! I don't have a baby but I can imagine that they are gentle and effeective. I use these for everything: Taking off my makeup at night, a quick refreshing clean up on a hot summer day, a face wipe if I am rushed in the morning (which is always), wiping my feet, wiping down the toilet seat and counter tops in the bathroom, and of course for ""personal"" use. These are gentle, effective, and environmentally friendly. I buy them on Amazon because of the great price and because I use them all of the time so buying them in bulk is a good idea! The best part... They don't have that awful baby butt smell!"
81644,2,This thing is AWFUL! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! It either spews white noise at you when the baby cries or just doesn't pick up the baby. I called First Years and they were less than helpful. When I asked why all the static with this product vs my Fisher Price monitor that was over 2 years old.....the response....&quot;Well this is better technology&quot;. I'll take my older technology since it works better thank you.I returned the product to BRU without my box but with my reciept. They gave me a FULL refund. That's more than I can say for First Years. They would only send me out another unit even tho I did not want another unit.I have since purchased another Fisher Price unit and am more than happy with it.
22087,1,"No issues with the seal, little hard to transfer to feeding bottles from bags. Otherwise great, we order these quite a bit, as my wife lives them."
160777,2,"Rough and scratchy. I returned it. Good idea, but a softer fabric is needed."
23354,2,"You may be better off just buying a regular trash can that seals tightly. This ""diaper disposal system"" does an OK job of odor control, but opening and closing it makes a rather jarring noise every single time. It almost sounds as if the whole thing is breaking, really. Not a pleasant experience when trying to keep a baby calm."
102440,2,"I purchased this product after comparing it to the mobiles that project onto the wall. I was super excited to get it in the mail but after I put it together and purchased the batteries for this thing, it didn't work right. Only the leaves would move and they did that very poorly. The lights and sound didn't work at all. Also, this mobile is RIDICULOUSLY LOW. Once your baby can reach up, that things is coming down!! What a piece of crap. I'm just sending it back for a refund because I don't have the time to wait and mess with the replacement mobile that Amazon will send.Word of advice. Don't buy this mobile, just keep looking!"
163435,1,"This High Chair is great when I do have my Grandchild over.. No worries that the kids need to transport theirs.It is easy to attach to one of my chairs. It only takes snapping the 2 sets of belts. Great product for feeding, eating or even letting them play with toys!"
101620,2,"We bought this monitor in anticipation of our third child. We assumed the scan feature would be a blessing. It's a curse. The transition from one channel to the next is not smooth. The switching is annoying and keeps me awake. Also, sensitivity is non-existant. My second daughter is across the hall from us and when she woke up ill and crying last night we could not hear her on the monitor. My wife heard her crying from her room. We received a free monitor from a baby store that works much better than this one. It's a shame because the concept is very good. But they should have put more money into the quality of the monitor than the packaging of the system. Pathetic."
20001,1,"My 16-month old can pull the bowl off his tray, so the suction isn't extremely strong. The trick is to just teach your child not to do that. Once he/she is disciplined to not pull on the bowl, then it serves a great use in staying in place while your child learns to use a spoon."
136493,0,The pieces Came scratched. Not very happy wish i would have spent more money to get a nicer set. Unhappy
183645,1,I've been using this cover on my boppy pillow for 8 months and with every feeding at home. It's soft and washes and wears very well. I even took my boppy with this cover to nurse my baby when I had him in the hospital.
10800,0,"I purchased these botttles due to them being BPA free and I am using a Medela pump. I agree with other reviewers that they are nice to pump into for storage and I feel comfortable warming them (vs. a polycarbonate bottle with BPA) - but the nipple that comes in this set is TERRIBLE. It flows much too fast and my 1 month old has choked each time I try to use the nipple. I am going to try using a different brand nipple with the bottle. Overall, they are less expensive than other BPA free bottles and the 5 ounce size is convenient for newborns/young infants. I have also used the Medela 2.7 ounce pump and store bottles (with the white lids) and find these are a very convenient size for freezing."
119891,1,smell good . I love it smell all day and my daughter smell fresh I would recommended it :). a
60728,2,"I registered for the diaper Genie when my daughter was born. I did not know of any other product out there. It is now been 6 mos and I am ready for a new product!! The diaper Genie is very stinky esp when the baby starts solids. You can never get rid of the odor. The darn thing broke the first time we tried to use it!! It has these clamps that hold the diaper in place so one can twist it. Well now I've got 2 missing (I think they fell out when it was being emptied). Needless to say mine doesn't make a poopie sausage anymore. Also, it really doesn't hold as many as I thought it would. I definately think there are better products out there."
170880,1,"I ordered three different items from Liz's wish list and made the mistake of ordering the items gift wrapped from Amazon. Well, the items came today and the boxes the items are in are beautiful, but they're GREEN. I called Amazon and they're refunding my charge for the boxes (almost $14, by the way). You're better off just ordering the items and wrapping them yourself, which is what I probably will wind up doing. Anyway, hope this was helpful to all you Liz and Paul fans out there."
166931,1,"This was easy to put together, I did it myself in about 3 minutes and it was easy to attach to the crib. We are expecting our daughter in 4 days so we will see if she likes it."
117819,1,"My 5-month-old daughter loves this jumper. She will happily play in it for an hour or two. The jumper is easy to assemble and place on the doorjamb, although this process definitely requires two hands (something of a luxury with a 5-month-old!). The jumper is very height-adjustable; once you think you've reached the end, you CAN adjust it further! If you (like me) accidentally threw out the instructions with the box, you can view them online[...]. The only complaint i have about this product is that it's quite difficult to maneuver the baby into and out of the seat, since the strap design makes you wiggle them through a series of convoluted strapping. Also, if you're tall or have back problems, this process will really not work for you. For our needs, though, it's been great!"
44093,1,I have a newly remobled bathroom and we went with the big fat faucet spout this sharp looking modern designed cover doesn't even go all the way over it. But if you have an average size faucet it would be great!
54586,2,"We love how unique this mobile is and it keeps our 3 month old very entertained most times, but I think it is over priced for the problems that come with it.1- It is unsafe because it tips over at the slightest touch. We don't have a fancy crib, just very simple and oddly enough the mobile does not fit properly over the side. We have to wedge a blanket to keep it from tipping over all the time!2- The motor is very noisy and so I can't use it to put my baby to sleep;it's only used for playtime.3-The On/Off button gets stuck sometimes.4- It consumes far too many batteries, it's already expensive.5- It is an extreme hassle to have to change the batteries by having to take the entire thing off of the crib, then unscrewing the battery compartment and then painfully adjusting it back on the crib all over again.What an expensive crib mobile that only does half of it's job, it should be half the price!"
26195,2,"I agree that this is a great concept, however, the mirror is way to small. It simply isn't functional for viewing your child in the back seat - especially if your child is in an rear facing infant seat because the carrier handle where you usually hang toys blocks the view of your baby's face all together. This product defintely needs improvements."
30101,1,"Lo mejor que haiga comrado, me parecio exelente para calmar los colicos de mi bebe. Y llego antes de lo ke me dijieron,.junto con los otros productos que compre.... love it. the best"
179857,2,"AFTER WAITING OVER A MONTH FOR THE ITEM IT'S NOW ""NOT IN STOCK"" AND WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE YOU A REFUND! SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN SNOOGLEING 35 DAYS AGO! RIDICULOUS!"
27897,0,"A nice little attachment, but not really worth paying $40-50 extra. It is so soft, it can only be used under the clothing and prolongs the finish to much. It feels nice but the grape head that is included for free with the eroscillator works much better and is powerful enough that I can even be lazy and keep my underwear on."
47780,0,"Mine came in two pieces also, which is fine. Nothing wrong with the product really, but my baby just slides down it through the night. Would benefit from a design upgrade that adds a bump across the bottom to stop sliding."
135837,1,"I both breastfed and gave the bottle to my daughter since day one. When she was a month old, she began to drink less milk from the bottle, and spitted a lot of it. Her pediatrician told be that perhaps she was swallowing too much air, and recommended the Dr. Brown's bottles. That was the solution.The only inconvenience is that you need to spend more time cleaning the bottles, but, believe me, it's well worth it.Good luck with your babies!"
3607,1,My son love this car seat. It's comfortable and not too big. Would buy again. Great product.
125328,1,I chose this because I need a few more dollars for my shopping cart to get the free shipping and I am so glad I did!! I LOVE this product more than the other (expensive) teether I bought. My son (9months)loves it too! Most teethers get really hard in the freezer but this one doesn't. My son loves it. He sometimes even crawls around with it in his mouth like a pacifier. I have a feeling this will get us through molars!
128604,1,"I am a mom-to-be and I received this as a shower gift, ran home, washed it, put it on the mattress. It fits fine, didn't shrink. I have a completely square mattress that fits very, very snug in my crib also, so I was thinking it might not work. But I was wrong -- so far, so good!"
150318,2,The first time I washed this item the elastic around the edges stretched out completely and now doesn't stay on the changing pad!
174734,1,"The valance was part of my bedding that I got, but it was not included in the ensemble that I purchased. It is very nice and I liked that you were the only site that actually gave the measurements of the valance!"
8203,0,"This basket works well as a daytime sleep spot - you could even use it for nights in lieu of a bassinet.We skipped the version with the hood because we thought it looked a little silly, but in hindsight might have opted for the sun-shade for those daytime naps.The big downside we ran into was the way the liner fell apart after its first wash, despite following the instructions which indicate that machine washing is okay. Maybe if you hand wash it you'll have better luck.I'd have given this basket 5*s if it hadn't come with the flimsy liner."
115210,2,"I've got 4 children and have used a few different gates in my time. We had one from our second child that we loved for our entrance into the kitchen but it finally broke and our fourth is still into everything so a gate was a must. I saw this and thought, ""Wow, it does everything I need!"". It's true, it's taller than most (my #4 is a climber and has come very close to climbing over standard gates), pressure mounted (we are putting this between a metal covered corner and thin paneling under a breakfast bar), and one handed operation while swinging both ways. Sounded perfect for us.Then reality settled in. It took less than 1hr for my 20mo old to figure out how to open it. Yep, that's right. 20mo old, through it in under an hour. The latch just isn't designed to stop a determined child. It's 1/8"" (maybe smaller) tongue that slides back with a thumb plate. He yanked on it and popped it out. Then he figured out how to pull it up and into the kitchen he went. Hmmm...maybe we didn't have it tight enough? We tightened it to the point where the auto-latch thing didn't work and we could barely latch it ourselves and still he got through. No matter how tight or how loose we made it, he could open it. We've had it a week and it's going back to the store to try something else.For the record, no, my #4 is NOT a huge tank. He is tall (hence the reason I liked the extra-tall gate) but he is only 30% in weight. If he could do it, so could just about any child that put their mind to it. I shudder to think of these at the top of stairs.I did call customer service and was told no refund through them but I could trade for a different one. All the ones that would work in that area had the same latch. No thanks!"
30452,0,"I bought this tub for my daughter when she was 3 months old - she loves to splash and this tub is too small for her flailing around. She hits her arms and legs on the sides snd gets annoyed. The Euro tub is bigger but no stability for smaller babies.I never used the sling because she wanted to be more in the water and the sling made her float up.The hump is annoying because when she gets excited she jumps over the hump - now I bathe her with my foot in the tub to stop her from jumping over the hump. The good thing about the hump is that since my daughter is small, it gives her good support while still letting her be in the water - she likes to recline and splash, something she cant do in the fully seated position.The toys are nice and we use them for rinsing and playing but I don't know what the thermometer thing is about - havent seen one in my set."
155886,1,"This is a great teether. My son was able to handle it well, even at a young age. He chewed on it even when it wasnt frozen. I also liked that there as a hole in the center so you could hook a pacifier chain or whatever in order to attach it to a car seat or highchair, Etc."
79710,1,I am very interested in purchasing this toy box but I would like to know the size of it before I buy it. Could someone please let me know what the dimensions are? Thank you.
23037,1,This is a lifesaver...better than taking fezzer packs and using a regular thermal bag....just take this and put in the freezer and grab and go....keeps the bottles cold all day when I am out...Highly recommend this....
37311,2,"We ordered this dresser to match the Storkcraft Deborah stages crib and changing table (both excellent products). However, this dresser is a piece of crap. We ordered it from Walmart.com in February. It came completely banged up, with parts missing, and other parts not even fitting together properly. We called the company three different times to get replacement parts (they sent us the wrong piece the first time around)... it is now the end of June and we are still waiting on the last piece. The dresser is made of venier, not hardwood like the website claims. It is a different color than the crib and changing table (we ordered the cognac) and doesn't match the rest of the furniture. Definitely not worth the money ..."
87967,1,"I usually don't write these reviews, but I feel so strongly about this product that I had to write a review.I am a first time mom. I bought this for my son when he was 4 weeks old. I was a little shocked by the price but now I would have paid much more for this. The very day I brought this home he played with it for an hour uninterupted. He loved the colorful toys and the noises that they made when he batted at them. This toy folds flat for storage or travel (which is invaluable). When you have baby in one hand you can very easily unsnap to set up with the other. This product is light weight and durable. The mat has been washed several times and still looks great.The toys detach from the activity gym and fit conveniently into a diaper bag. My son loves the octopus and I was relieved that it is sold separately in case mommy lost it.My son is almost 6 months old and he lays on his tummy and looks up at the animals, which is a great way to get a young baby to try to lift their head.This is a great toy!!!!!"
154865,1,Although I am a huge amazon reviews fan and refuse to make a single purchase without looking up the reviews on Amazon first. I have never written up a review myself.....till now.This blanket actually works. Our son wasnt that bad of a sleeper to begin with. He is almost 11 lbs and 6 weeks old. He would wake up at about 3 AM every night. That is until I brought this blanket home. I purchased this blanket at a retail store in NYC and wasn't sold that it would really work but was willing to give it a try.It's been two nights now and our son has slept through the entire night both nights. My wife is starting to feel like a real person again. She was having a hard time with all the middle of the night waking up. I am recommending this blanket to everbody who has a newborn and wants to sleep.Thank you Miracle Blanket
118844,1,"Really attractive carseat, and much more sturdy than the cheaper like models. Def worth the extra $$$$"
49463,1,"We purchased this with the intention of making a play area, but ended up using the length of the yard for a divider, which works very well to keep our 9 mo. old out or away from the hot stove and kitchen. A two piece section (the extender, purchased separately) works well to keep children away from book shelves, TV, etc. [We use bungie ties to secure] Lots of uses. It is very functional and lightweight, although a bit bulky, for travel."
84023,1,"Just received and am writing to clarify what I saw in other reviews: the inside IS unfinished particle board. I am probably going to paint it. The wood smell is also strong, so I am leaving it open for several days before giving it to my daughter. However, the product is just as pictured on the outside, it's soft, the chenille fabric is lovely, the hinges are sturdy, and the size is just perfect for the foot of a twin bed. It's big enough to hold many of our larger toys, but not so big that you would get lost in it trying to find something. The hinges are made so that when you let go of the lid, it does not close--you have to push down on the lid to close it--thus avoiding pinched fingers. The bottom, top, and sizes are thick enough to be sturdy. I know this will be a big help in keeping my 2YO's room neat."
80985,0,"My partner thought I was a little silly for getting this potty seat for our 2.5 year old, but I'm glad that I did. Our trip back East to see family was easier for always having a clean, small seat for our daughter to use, and it was a nice enticement to use the potty while out and about! On the other hand, while it's certainly portable, the seat is not completely stable, as is the one we use at home. That is, on some toilets, I not only had to carefully position the seat, but then I was required to continually secure it to make sure it didn't collapse inward while my daughter was on it. That may sound worse than it was, in that I'm still glad to have the seat, and found it worth the price."
131069,2,"We bought this yesterday and will be taking it back. I have a boy and the pee guard is very flexible. When he would sit on the potty the pee guard folded right down into the pot and is useless. Also the flush feature, although very cute, is a big distraction. He would rather stand up and flush than sit on the potty. This might be an ok potty for a girl but not a boy."
14775,2,"I breastfed my son for 5 months and gave him occasional bottle with either formula or pumped breastmilk since he was born. He had problems with the Avent newborn nipple, the flow was too fast for him for the first month. The milk would drip out of his mouth. Eventually he got used to it, but he had problems with spit up so we switched to Dr.Brown bottles (less spit up). When my son was around 4 months old he refused Avent bottles and Dr.Brown bottles. We tried different size nipples, we tried warming the nipple, we tried heating the formula at different temperature. Nothing worked. For two weeks it was like that. Finally I tried Gerber NUK size 2 and I couldn't believe my eyes, he started sucking immediately. If you're switching between breastfeeding and bottlefedding save your money and buy the most inexpensive and the best bottle out there, Gerber bottles (especially NUK)."
64823,1,"So far, no complaints. Easy to assemble. Folds up easily for car trips, and light enough to move from room to room."
2475,2,"I have two girls and a boy, when my daughters were in diapers I always used huggies, but when my son was born they did not keep him dry through the night so I switched to Pampers Baby Dry because that was the type of diaper that claimed to be best for boys, but it is not, my son leaks through all over his clothes and the person holding him and the diaper itself is nearly dry. It is as though the diaper can not absorb the pee fast enough. I would not recomend this product."
75298,2,"My wife bought this pump after reading reviews and thought this would suit us as we travel a lot for our jobs. It's light and easy to travel with. It worked great for the first 5 months we owned it. She loved it! She was solely pumping, so the pump definitely got a lot of use but around the 5th month, the suction started to stop working. This created lots of problems with her milk supply and had to start supplementing with formula. I read other reviews that had similar problems around the 6th month...with the suction going bad. But others haven't. So it's a great deal and a great pump if the suction stays good. you will be taking a chance with this one. The company is very easy to work with...they are sending us a new pump but it still falls under the one year warranty from when we purchased the first pump. so if this one goes bad in 7 months, we will be out a pump. They would not return the pump which probably isn't that abnormal, but still annoying. She doesn't have anything to compare it to since this is our first child and first pump. But will probably go with a different pump next time around."
26963,0,"I read many of the reviews before I purchased this product. I decided to get the size that I currently am, and that was a large. The large is too big. I should have gotten a medium. Otherwise the product worked good. I would have loved to send it back, but then I would have to pay for shipping again."
172143,1,"This was purchased as a gift for my Granddaughter. The baby has not arrived as yet, but from observing the tub I can honestly say it looks amazing. I was not fortunate enough, when raising my children, to have the opportunity to use this useful tub."
8951,1,"This bag is perfect for us. It's just our style. It can be a little tight at times, but we tend to be light packers. We cloth diaper, so that takes up a lot of space on day trips, but we breast feed as well so we don't have bottles and formula taking up space either."
104031,1,Gold Bond Ultimate powder is the best product I have found. Over the years I have tried many different items to prevent getting rashes. At last I found it. I have not been able to find this product in any stores for quite some time now and that is the only down side of this product.
49930,1,"I have read the other reviews and can't believe that so many people have had a bad experience with this stroller. I have a red one and absolutely LOVE it! I've had mine about 6 months and have not had any problems with it. I did extensive research before choosing this stroller and have never been sorry. It is easy to use, light weight to handle, manuvers great. I have recomended this stroller to all of my friends. It seems really safe, and my daughter is comfortable in it. It is the only umbrella type stroller that I found that had a nice padded seat area. There are nicer strollers for sure, but not in this price range, and other umbrella strollers don't even compare. We are very happy with our purchase, and would make it again.***we have now had this stroller over 2 years, and I am still loving it. It has been through the mall and the mud and is still kicking. My girls are outgrowing it finally, but if I needed a new folding stroller, I would re-purchase this one in a heartbeat. We have checked it planeside at the airport, and basically abused it, and it is still holding up great."
161532,1,"I agree with everything jrcaesar said in the previous review, in fact he/she saved me quite a bit of typing. I have been using this tub for a week now, after using the Safety 1st Space Saver tub from 6 weeks til 8 1/2 months. What more can I say, I love it, my daughter loves it. We put it up on the kitchen counter and when we're done, we drag the end over the edge of the sink and pull the plug. No mess besides the water my daughter kicks all over the kitchen, and that's to be expected! P.S. The locking tabs get easier with time as long as you properly assemble the tub on a regular basis."
168925,1,"I like the cool elmo and other colourful characters on the front where the flaps adhere. Even the flaps are easy to find in their yellow colour, making it easy to get the right side up. These dont smell like the sensitive ones with extra medicinal stuff in them."
56675,0,"I bought two of these in preparation for my daughter's imminent crawling adventures. The build quality of the product was good, felt very sturdy. However, when I installed them, they were easily pulled off. The locking mechanism is too wide to fit securely behind the knob as shown in the product photo. They were installed properly and as tight as they could go, but to no avail. These won't work on my cabinets. I gave it three stars because it might work for you, and it's well made. Just be sure you have more than two inches or so between your knobs and cabinet doors or it won't work as intended."
150766,0,"This dresser is perfect for what I wanted but I found that some of the Cam-locks (the screws that they give you for assembly) arent doing their jobs properly. In a couple of the drawers, the cam-locks kept falling out and the front would fall off of the drawers so finally I just got some Gorilla Wood Glue and glued all of the drawer pieces together. It hasnt fallen apart since.Not the best product out there, and a little under par for the price, but still gets the job done and great for those on a budget."
124305,0,"it seems to do the job.... but it is cheap, and kinda a pain in the butt to open... but I would def say it is child proof!!!"
162832,1,"Great product. I bought it with the lid included. It works great. Sometimes Cheerios would come out but it does keep spills to a minimum. Handles are great that you can use it to secure it on stroller or high chair. If the flap could be just a little bit softer, that would be perfect. Overall, I would have purchased it again and I highly recommend it."
170951,1,"This is a great product, but the battery life isn't high if you want to hear detailed audio, instead of bursts of audio. I prefer to be able to hear my baby's breathing at night, which is only available in the constant transmission mode, which drains the battery quickly. The 8 hour battery life assumes 25% transmission, so the battery life would sensibly yield about 2 hours.We had a SCD 589, which has some great features beyond these, but you cannot get a second parent unit or a second charging base. As such, we switched to these units."
145011,1,"I don't know if this product will work for everyone or not, but it definitely worked on my belly. I am 42 years old and was pregnant with twin girls. (Born Jan. 15, 2013) I applied to by stomach and sides at morning and at bedtime and did not have one stretchmark. Friends or family who asked to see my belly would comment on how great my skin looked. At Dr. and ultrasound appointments they would also comment 'not one stretchmark!&#34; I kept waiting for them to appear, but they never did. The oil smells lightly of lavender. Very soothing. I totally 100% recommend trying this product."
83235,1,"I haven't tried other slings, but I can say this one has been great compared to other carriers. We also own a Bjorn, which my husband prefers - he hasn't even tried the sling, and is good for subway rides (at least at 13 lbs.) But I prefer the sling. When he was first born, I could carry him chest to chest and he'd sleep while I walked around and did things (including type on the computer.) I never figured out the cradle position when he was this little but he also hated being carried cradled, he prefers upright. Now he enjoys sitting in it on my hip. I have both hands free. He can see out, and I can see his face (unlike in the Bjorn). He enjoys watching what I'm doing, and it's fast to throw on if he's fussing. In the beginning, I agree with the advice to keep walking while putting it on. The video was very helpful. It takes a little patience to learn how to use it well, but it's worth it."
61809,0,"I bought this carseat for my 4 month old who is 18 lbs. 26 1/2"". He is bigger for his age, but keep in mind that this car seat is supposed to hold children up to 65 lbs............... The crotch strap is a real problem. I even removed the pad that goes around the crotch strap and it's still a problem. He sits nearly on top of the strap and it's difficult to get it buckled. It needs to be moved up (toward the edge of the seat) about 2"" and it needs to be about 2"" longer and it would be perfect. I even looked into replacing the crotch strap thinking maybe Britax would make a replacement one or something. No such luck. I don't mind spending $300 on a seat, but this one is going back. We had better luck fitting him in the Decathalon as the strap is adjustable. I hope Britax fixes this problem.........Other than that it is a wonderful, awesome, safe seat."
170536,1,"We purchased the Britax Marathon for my son when he was 8 months old. We kept him rear-facing until he reached the max weight for rear-facing at 2.5 years old. Now 4, he rides front-facing and still has a lot of room to grow. We bought the denim cover and it still looks great. It has been washed countless times, and like a pair of jeans, the denim has faded in areas, but I think the fading makes it look really cute.We have driven all over the country and my son rarely complains of being uncomfortable. This seat is well padded and perfect for napping.I love the rigid latch. I really didn't appreciate this until I tried to install my nephew's cheap Wal*Mart carseat and had a VERY difficult time getting a proper fit. The Marathon cinches down quickly and easily. Once installed, it doesn't budge. If your vehicle doesn't have LATCH, the Marathon has seatbelt lock-offs to help maintain the proper tension of the seatbelt. This has really been handy for us since my sister-in-law's car doesn't have locking seatbelts in the backseat. No problem for us, though!In short, I can't say enough about the Marathon. It has been one of the best investments I've made. We have had 4 years of use from our Marathon and I anticipate at least another year before my son outgrows it.Compatibility: This carseat has been installed with no problems in many different vehicles ranging from Toyota Corolla to Chevy Suburban. Actually, I have yet to encounter a vehicle in which I was unable to obtain a rock-solid installation."
41280,1,"cruisers are the best but amazon just ruined their good rep. I always thought amazon was the best because of their great prices but then they change it not a dollar or so but 3 dollars!!!!!! SHAME ON YOU!! It used to be worth it to buy 5 packs at a time, but now i can go to the drug store and pay less plus get them the same day instead of 3-5 weeks!! Just ridiculous. Amazon,your losing lots of customers..."
48391,1,"I purchased a different brand video monitor and it was horrible- bad reception, small screen. This monitor is wonderful! The picture is perfect, the monitor is very portable and I don't wake my son up to check on him during his naps anymore!"
135766,2,"Did not mention anywhere in the product description that these are the plastic Dr. Brown's bottles, not the glass ones I was looking for. They are listed as BPA-Free but we're sticking with glass. Back they go."
178601,1,"not one for writing reviews, but this carrier is great. much easier to get around a busy place with the little guy in this and he loves being able to look around so it is a win-win all around. went shopping in the mall for the first time without a stroller and it was glorious! no having to bob and weave through people with a bulky stroller bumping into everything. i'm not sure i'm going to ever want to use the stroller again... very easy to use and the directions are simple. this may not be for you if you have back problems or have trouble carrying around your own weight. not hating, just telling it like it is..."
145304,1,"I purchased this jumperoo for my 7-month-old daughter recently from another vendor. She LOVES it! At first, she was overwhelmed by it and quickly got upset when we put her in it, but after some coaxing and demonstration, all was well.She now will play in it for (literally) an hour or more until she (again, literally) passes out in it. We love how very happy she is in it and how strong her legs have gotten from the jumping.The item seems very well made and not at all flimsy. Some other reviewers commented on the attached flower toy, how it doesn't stand up on its own. I think perhaps this was intentional. It has helped our daughter learn that a) she can get the flower by pulling on the stem and b) that just because she can't see it, it doesn't mean it has gone away. The seat is easily detachable for washing and I have run it through washer and dryer twice with no problems: no fading, no fraying, no shrinking.There are two settings for the sounds and lights. You can set it to respond when baby jumps and turns, or you can set it to respond likewise but stay on for 5 minutes continuously. The seat swivels smoothly and the toys require just the right amount of participation. I think there is something to be said for toys that still ""need"" baby to play; there seem to be a lot of things on the market now that ""play"" all by themselves.Overall, we are very pleased with this purchase. I do wish we had bought from Amazon, as their price was lower than what we paid.I would (and have) recommend this to all moms!"
31092,2,"Be extra sure you want this before ordering as it is difficult to return. We tried to find this in a store and could not find it anywhere so we could not test it out in person, and we ordered from Amazon. After receiving it we realized it was not really what we were looking for (although it seemed like a well built, quality product) so we initiated the return process with Joovy. TWO MONTHS LATER we finally received our refund. Joovy customer service is extremely unorganized. Basically everything they told us was wrong and had to be re-done. They lost our return, they could not find our order, they could not find our receipt, they dragged their feet and were in no hurry to help, one thing after another, they kept saying one thing then another, a complete nightmare. We ended up purchasing theEddie Bauer All-Terrain Tandem Stroller Bryant Collectionand we love it. It is less expensive, more flexible, carries more, and the rear seat folds down horizontal so our infant can sleep. The one drawback is that it is heavier. P.S. Amazon customer service in handling this return was outstanding, 5 stars."
149173,1,I had a few other women tell me that I would need this when I got closer to my due date and boy were they right! I was so uncomfortable I could barely sleep but as soon as I bought this I started sleeping like a baby. This pillow is a must have for any pregnancy.
86344,2,"I did my research before buying the Summer Infant Day and Night monitor. It seems like many people opt for this monitor and it got mostly good reviews so I figured I would try it out.At first, I did like the monitor. The picture is very clear, even at night. And the range is pretty good, I could go outside and still get a pretty good signal for video/audio.Right away, I noticed something very STRANGE: I occasionally saw a different crib!! I tried the other channel, but the other channel's signal was not as good. Seeing the other baby's crib happened when the reception for my channel wasn't as good. I live in a townhome, but I know for a fact that there are no babies in cribs in my building or in the building next to me. It might be a building across the street?!At first I thought I could live with that since otherwise it was a good monitor, but as I thought about it, I became more uncomfortable with the idea. Someone may occasionally be able to see my son. This is not safe at all. I don't want some random stranger being able to see my son's room, his routine, what he looks like, etc. Plus, at night I go into my son's room in a shirt and underwear.If you don't mind other people being able to peep into your house, then this is a good monitor, otherwise, opt for a digital monitor that is more secure. We will be returning this one asap."
182430,1,"Rapid healing of dry, cracked or damaged skin!Even eczema and psoriasis is healed quicker and better than using prescription medication with cortisone.Using this on lips AM/PM will give luscious,hydrated and beautiful lips!"
87203,2,"In my first pregnancy, I used the cocoa butter stick from The Body Shop - loved it! Unfortunately, they are out of stock, so this time around I bought the Bella B Tummy Honey Stick. HATE IT! It is very sticky and gritty, not smooth at all. I'm going back to creams/lotions until the cocoa butter stick from The Body Shop is back."
170794,2,"I purchased 2 of these sheets in the Saratoga print from the store. I washed them several times and the fabric was still so rough and abrasive that I ended up returning them. They do seem to be well made and were easy to put on and take off, which is the only reason I give 2 stars. But if you prefer your baby to have something soft against his/her skin, buy some fabric and make you own; it's very easy and cost much less!"
37952,0,"The best feature of this stroller is the adjustable handle! I am always lowering the handle and my husband is always raising it since it is done so easily. Everything else is just like every other stroller out there. The seat is fine, the wheels are fine, etc etc. I walked to our local health club and back pushing this stroller which was a total of 11+ miles and did not have aches and pains like I do after pushing our ""mall stroller"". (foldable Combi) It is worth mentioning that we do have another stroller as this one does not fold very well and is not something you would want to push around a mall or other busy function. I would not pay a lot of $$$ for this stroller, but I would buy it again for what we paid (I think about $120-$150, whatever it was on Amazon)"
52651,2,"Usually I am very pleased with Fisher-Price products. I have been using them ever since I was a little girl. This is the first product that I have been dissatisfied with. I have two children and I got the Ocean Wonder Swing as a shower gift for my last child. I put him in it as a newborn and felt it didn't provide enough support. I thought it would be better once he gained a little more head control, but again I was wrong. My son is a normal developing infant and can situp with support. He's weight is within the required weight for the swing. For some reason, he tends to slide to the side or tilts forward whenever I place him in the swing. I'm afraid to even turn it on because his head can slide to the side where it would hit the side bar. I think the chair doesn't recline enough. It seems like the engineering of the chair to swing ratio is a little off. I don't use the swing, it's sits in the nursery or the playroom and my 2 year old puts her dolls in it. I feel this product is dangerous and should be recalled. I'm not just writing so that every concerned parent can read my review. I'm hoping that someone who's responsible for product safety and customer satisfaction can hear my plea and do something about this product. I would love to be able to totally trust your products, all of them.Sincerely,C. WilliamsMother of 2"
162922,1,"This dresser was hands-down the easiest furniture assembly I've done in the past several years. All the parts (screws, etc.) were there, all the holes were well-drilled and centered, and everything fit together just as it should. I did nearly all of it by myself, in about three hours. The finished dresser is beautiful and has plenty of storage for all of my daughter's clothes. I would highly recommend this dresser!"
170121,1,"After searching and searching, my husband and I finally decided on this crib and I am so glad we did. It is absolutely gorgeous! It looks like we paid alot more for it than we did. Only took the both of us about 30 minutes to put together. I also like the fact that it doesn't have a dropside and it is still easy for me to reach into as I am only about 5'1 so I don't think there'll be a problem getting the baby in and out. I would absolutely recommend this crib to everyone I know who's having a baby!"
122461,1,"great product! I loved that it came with a star map, the kids had a great time picking wich ones to put on there ceilings. The only complaint I had was that there was not enough adhesive putty for the amout of stars in this package, I had to go out and buy more atr the craft store."
12000,2,We use this headrest for their bouncy seats only. I don't use it in their car seats because the smaller part of the head rest only fit their heads for a few weeks and the bigger part is to big for them now.
17942,1,"Everything is great about this potty chair, except that it could have had a little more of the foundation to be a little more sturdy. Of course, since I got it for my grandchild and i haven't gotten it to them yet, i can't really say too much about the sturdiness yet. It looks great and the seat is easily removable to make the transition to the toilet top as your child grows. I have bought other potty chairs in the past and this one is more convenient, i think a better color for the eyes and a nice style as well. With the others the extra piece for boys was a little bothersome but this one is much better. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.thanks"
36025,1,"My baby loves the change pad. He loves having his diaper changed and as soon as I place him on the pad, he starts getting hyper and happy. It's soft enough and I like the straps in case I need to grab something near by (don't leave baby strapped by himself though)."
168666,2,"Nice conventient gift for new babies living far away. With quantity on hand, one less item for new moms and dads to rush to store and purchase. Pricing is good also."
59269,1,"I love these orthodontic pacifiers - they're the best. And for convenience, it was so nice to be able to purchase them online, as they're difficult to find in some of our frequently-shopped stores. But the fact that you can't request a color is pretty stupid. Our baby is a boy, and we really have no interest in getting red, yellow, pink or purple pacifiers, but requesting specific colors is not allowed. (We were sent 2 yellow and red packs, by the way.) It would be a customer-friendly choice to allow shoppers some individual preferences with these."
120160,1,"These wipes are a life saver. Granted you cant get in the middle part where the milk flows down, for the most part these wipes get the bulk of the milk cleaned up so it can be ready for use 2 hrs later. If you think about it, this is perfectly fine because fresh breastmilk has antibodies that allow it to be out of the frig for 4 hrs. So, if you're pumping every 2 to 3 hrs, then you're golden. I've been using these wipes for about 2 wks now (every since I returned to work) it has made my breast feeding experience a more comfortable one."
65108,1,"I love this car seat! It has a pretty seat cover that you can change which means I can use it for my next child, even if its a boy. I also love that it has velcro on the seat belt so it holds the belts open to easily put my little girl in. Very easy to adjust seat belts and to switch from car to car since we only have one seat. It's definately worth a little extra cash! Plus, who can argue with the safest seat available!?!"
11238,1,"easy to put on and off --- the baby has not taken a dump in the pool with this on, so i am not sure how effective it is for that."
147971,1,"My daughter used this bouncer most of her life, from about 1 month to about 8 months. We still use it occasionally at 10 months: sometimes she wants to be in the bathroom with me when I take a shower, so I put her in the bouncer. She is content there for the length of a shower, and occasionally I use it in the kitchen, to keep her out of trouble. Normally she is happy to play in the living room, but for those times when she wants to be near me, sometimes she prefers the bouncer to the floor or the high chair. From 1-6 months, she ADORED this bouncer. She loved that she could be near me, no matter what room I was in and no matter what I was doing. She also loved the waterfall, the vibration setting, the sounds, and the toys. On vibrate mode, as a newborn to 3 month old, she'd often take naps in her bouncer. Occasionally the jumping frog would get stuck, but he'd unstick himself or I'd nudge him and he'd be okay. We only had to replace batteries two or three times in almost a year. Considering all the use this bouncer got, it held up really well and seemed very well made. We only had to wash the cloth cover once, and it came out of the dryer looking like new- not all nubbly and faded. This was one of the best items we got for our baby, and if it were bigger or converted to a toddler item, she'd probably still be using it! Go for it!"
83811,1,"I purchased this placemat when my daughter was about a year old, and I have found it to be very useful when dining out. I was hesitant to buy another baby gadget, but I have found this placemat to be well worth the money. The scoop tray really helps contain the mess, and it makes cleanup at the table much easier (just shake off the mat and roll it up). The only problem I found is that the suction cups do not stick to textured table surfaces.When I accidentally forget the placemat when eating out with my daughter, I normally miss it so I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a portable placemat."
180875,1,My 4-month old needed something more to do and loved when I dangled toys above her so i found this gym and it had rave reviews so I bought it. It was well worth the money. Easy set-up and it folds up easily so I can move it out of the way without a hassel. My baby LOVES the mirror! Most of the time i find her holding it in her little hands. She also loves the crackle leaf and the the little animal tail on the mat during her tummy time.THe bright colors are wonderful. The music and lights that are activated by her movement are perfect. And the mat is so easy to to wash...which is very important with a little baby having accidents on it. Totally worth every penny!
38884,1,This bathing pillow is the best! It keeps baby warm and is very comfy. My baby loves it - she can still kick around in the water while her head is elevated. I highly recommend this product for babies that are not sitting up.
158985,0,"This carrier is a great idea but not worth all the money. It takes more time trying to figure out the right way to put it on and by the time you do get it on, the baby is too frustrated to be happy riding around in it.When we do get it figured out...before the baby is already cranky, it works and we can walk around for at least 30 minutes...sometimes longer before he gets tired of sitting in it. However, most of the time he likes being outside and looking around at all the new sites."
116265,1,"The bumkins organic line of products are simply fabulous. We have bought the towels and washcloths for our twins. They are so soft, have super absorption and dont feel so wet after use. Definitely one of the best buys that we have made in recent times."
93550,2,"Firstly, my daughter did NOT like the music. Well, I shouldn't say that, she got so distracted by it she stopped doing her business, jumped off, and then peed or pooed in her pants about 10 minutes later. So, out went hte batteris and we had better success.I must also say that it leaks. I would not buy it again."
10631,1,"This drying rack is small but holds everything I need. It holds up to 8 bottles and also has space for the rings, nipples and caps. I have not used the brush it came with because I already have one but I'm sure it will get the job done if I ever have to use it. If you want something small but durable this item is for you."
7173,1,"I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent."
175997,0,"I would definitely say that this is a must on any shower registry. Ordered it after a friend said she loved hers. My baby doesn't like the cradle hold in the k'tan, but we use the outer-facing and inner-facing holds all the time. I have found it to be more comfortable on my shoulders than the baby bjjorn. I use it in restaurants if he needs to nap, and take him grocery shopping/ errand running in it as he dislikes the car seat in the shopping cart method. Highly recommend this!!"
55585,1,"I bought this warmer months before I knew anything about bottle warming or what brand bottles I would use. I wound up using Dr. Brown's wide-neck & regular bottles and have not had any problems since the day we came home from the hospital.It warms up my son's bottles quicker than 5 minutes and has never overheated one, as far as formula bubbling out of the bottle, directions on all bottles usually indicate that neck rings should be removed or loosened before heating any bottle to avoid leaks. We haven't had this problem, I just remove the neck-ring before heating each bottle.We always keep the water holder filled, so when my son wakes up hungry, all we have to do is pour the water in & drop in bottle and change him while the bottle is warming up. I find this warmer to be very easy and convenient to use. We just started using it to warm up his baby food jars as well."
89052,1,We really love the Pampers baby dry for our 13 month old. We can't really think of any significant leaks be it during the night( when we don't change his nappies cause it disturbs his sleep)or during the day. Also with Amazon's great prices it is a good buy...
52310,1,"My son loves the pics on his new ""big boy underware"" and couldn't wait to try them out. They fit him really well and prevent leeks on small accidents. They are not a diaper, so we do have a few large accidents, but this, in turn, has helped with the training process. We've been wearing these for a week now, and are already accident free! I say skip the pull-ups and go straight to these trainnig pants!"
57438,1,"I bought this because I really liked the looks of the Infant Papasan chair --but I didn't like that that one didn't bounce at all. This one has all of the plush comfort, plus she can make it bounce. She's now 4 months and she likes to sit in it and play with her feet or play with toys/rattles/stuffed animals that I hand her. And she'll still nod off in it. It doesn't have a lot of lights/music/activity -but really, by the time they get old enough to do that, there are a lot of other options. She likes her jumperoo or her activity mat for that. She likes this for sitting and chatting with me or watching me work. And it's a nice size. She still fits in it at 4 months (and she's a big baby) while she hangs out of some of the others we've tried."
317,1,"We have used these diapers on our 1 year old for the past 6 months, and I can only remember one time that the diaper leaked in the middle of the night. The diaper will be very full in the morning, but no more middle of the night changes! We will continue to use these diapers at night."
2617,1,"These are the bast diapers that I will only use!! They hold up all through the night and he is dry in the morning. Ive used the dry max and my son got the worst rash from them, and they were gone the next day. Ive used these ever since then. Great product."
54705,1,I've read a number of reviews on this product and obviously this is not for everyone. I had the opportunity to try this when my son was in the neonatal intensive care unit. He loved it so much that I plan on buying one for his nursery at home. The clacking noise is a little annoying and the music isn't as clear as I would like but I'm not buying it for me. My son is the one who liked it. We have the Baby Bugs mobile on his crib right now and he loves it but the music plays for only a couple of minutes (and it plays the same tune over and over) while this mobile plays for 15 minutes. One night in the NICU he fell asleep watching the animals. I have a rather demanding baby and this calmed him down. I'm sold.
84297,2,"As some others mentioned, the uneven ropes are a pain.The crimped ropes made it impossible to even the swing.We eventually just cut the ropes and tied knots to get the desired angle for a safe ride for the child.I would NOT recommend this to anyone."
44672,0,Worked great in the beginning for my daughters reflux. But as she got a little bigger I had trouble keeping her in place. I still prefer the boppy to the cozy me. But I have found other uses now that my daughter is beginning to sit supported. She has more freedom to move but still remains more stable.
81421,1,Very light and easy to handle. Folds easily and with one hand. I would recommend this stroller to everyone with a little one.
152728,1,"We LOVE our Vigour. It was a little on the pricey side, but it is worth every dollar. You definitely get what you pay for in this stroller.It unfolds/folds with ease and turns on a dime. You can push it with one hand. It also has awesome suspension. We use it with our ""Companion"" car seat all of the time. We are really happy with the setup.This stroller is highly recommended."
59691,1,"WE LOVE THIS BATH! It's awesome, our 5 month old son feels secure in it and we feel secure having him in it! We started off using the Fisher-Price Aquarium Bath Center and it was awful. Made bath time stressful for all of us. He would wiggle, slip, slide and get scared, as would we! It was horrible...we were beginning to think that bath time just wasn't one of those things our little guy would love...that was until we found the PRIMO EuroBath! Bath time is no longer a dreaded experience! It is now a relaxing fun time for all three of us! He still wiggles around but doesn't slip as much due to the design of this bath. He can now play with his bath toys without worrying about holding on for dear life (as he did with the FP bath)! We highly recommend this bath!"
123302,1,"This is the second Graco crib I have purchased - the first for my grandchildren - this for my great grandchild. It is a bit on the heavy side, and sometimes Gramma couldn't remember how to set it up, but it is still the nicest portable crib manufactured today, in my opinion. It is roomy enough that the babies could play without feeling too cramped. Very handy for visits to grandparents or play dates, and great at home when Mom needs a brief break."
28798,1,"A breeze to assemble, and really comfy. There are pockets hanging from the armrests that were a pleasant surprise, they are a nice place to hold books or cell phone."
164787,1,Wipes smells good. They come out of the dispensor great. They are a little on the thin side. I would buy again.
150504,2,"We bought this a few weeks ago, for our 2 1/2 year old son. He began using it on his own after a couple of days of us just having it out. The positives are, it's got a lid that is fun, and it's very easy to empty, and easy to assemble once you figure out these little rubbery things that help it not slip. Negatives are, the seat is very tiny, the little ""pee guard"" that flips up for little boys, constantly and I mean CONSTANTLY falls off or flips down right when he gets on it! I was trying to hook it back on yesterday while he was on it (he said he really, really had to go) and I got peed on in the process, so that wasn't so fun. My little guy gets into an odd cowboy straddle position to back onto the potty so that pee guard doesn't go down, and yet 90% of the time it falls off while he's on it, or it flips down and it's hard to get it back up once he's on it. Also it doesn't seem very stable. So I'm really wishing we didn't buy it, and greatful it was so cheap. Go with another potty! Makes me wish I would've kept the one we used with our older son."
116584,2,"This item can re-route the harness straps on your carseat, causing extra slack. It is also bulky, which in itself adds slack. If you feel that you need a cover other than blankets over your infant's carseat, PLEASE get one that just goes over the baby, not under.Also, the baby in the picture is much too tall for an infant carrier."
164830,2,"This is my first time using Pampers. I've used them consistently for almost a month. Is it just me or do they seem to be soaking wet ALL the time. I put them on my daughter and an hour later it's soaked and needs to be changed. Unless I can them for free again, I wouldn't purchase again."
102338,1,"As a Grandmother of twin girls. I can tell you this is the best investment I have made thus far, and I am a Grandma so you know I have made many..lol The mobile makes the girls happy and they light up when they see it moving and the leaves going up and down. The characters are so cute and colorful. This mobile would accent any decor!! I had the old wind up type prior to receiving this one, and though it was cute, it always annoyed them both when it stopped, along with the loud clanking of winding it back up, the disturbance of CLANK, CLANK, CLANK was both annoying and inconvenient. This wonderful mobile buys me the time that I need to prepare bottles, or change a diaper while the other is enjoying the music rainforest show!! I love it because they love it, it is convenient and the babies sleep so well undisturbed. With twins, one baby can easily awake the other, but with one tiny click the soothing music begins and the characters move around and they are back into their peaceful sleep. Fisher Price I have always loved your toys, and grew up with them myself. I am impressed with the way you have kept up with new and innovative ways of entertaining babies/kids. You have really outdone yourself with this mobile and I love the crib aquarium soother of which I will be leaving a review about as well. Thank you from my twins and I!! Amazon, you again exceeded my expectations by delivering my package BEFORE estimated delivery date. You have outstanding service and deserve KUDOS as well!! I see a long relationship into the future!! :)"
136820,0,"These work well (my 22 month old son has yet to open them), but I did drop a couple on a hard surface (kitchen tile), and they did break due to how brittle they are. But then again these are priced relatively inexpensive.I like how they fit handles that are far apart or handles that are close (where some latches can't accommodate).Although some have broken due to my dropping them, I have purchased some more given the low cost of replacement.Notwithstanding how brittle they are, given the price I would recommend."
98939,1,"Subscribing to Amazon Mom is the best thing I could've done. I am kicking myself for not trying it a little sooner; I could've saved a lot more money, and with a new little one, who wouldn't need to save more? Every chance I get, I am recommending to all my friends to buy Pampers through amazon Mom!"
53156,0,I love table toppers and have used them with 2 kids. The graphic on this one is just okay. I prefer ones that have lots of letters and numbers or the Dora ones with many objects in 2 languages. It makes waiting for meals more of an opportunity for learning. These are just fun with the characters on them. Better for babies that aren't up to the letter learning yet.
30423,2,"This tub is very disappointing. Let me tell you why:1) The newborn stage hammock is very badly designed and really has very little support. You have to tighten the straps very tight because if you don't, the baby is supported by the tall piece in the middle separating the two halves of the tub. The folks at fisher price were kind enough to mold this with an indentation for the baby's body, but honestly, would YOU like to be held up by a single beam placed horizontally across your back?? I tried to pad it with a couple of washcloths after it caused a bruise (and my son was not terribly wriggly when he was a newborn), but that did little to abate the problem. When you do tighten the hammock straps so as to alleviate the pressure from the evil plastic piece, the baby is literally out of the water, plus the hammock itself leaves no room to dunk a cup or scoop in to ladle water over the baby. What an unpleasant experience!2) The second stage (reclining end) keeps most of your baby's body, again, out of the water even when filled as much as you can get it. See those pictures on the box? They must be edited, because the actual tub is nowhere near that deep! (the bubbles do look kind of fake) My baby is also long, so his head hits the rim of the bath and did so from day 1. This made it hard to actually wash him without getting water everywhere. I had to resort to padding this with washcloths, which were necessary in any case because the plastic is too slippery to support a baby.3) Third stage for TODDLERS? It would be nicer if you had somewhere to dunk your cup/hand so that you can rinse the baby. I'm not having a huge problem with this part right now except for that divider again. It cuts the tub size down for the third stage quite a bit, and is entirely too small if your baby likes to move around at all. My baby is 4 months old and this end barely works for us. I honestly can't imagine the third stage working for ANY toddler and am currently shopping around for a new tub.Some things to consider after reading my review: My son has grown rather quickly. At 4 months, he is over 16 lbs and almost 27 inches long. He was average weight/length at birth, but is now quite large. (he's also exclusively breastfed and I have been told that breastfed babies don't usually get quite so big so fast). Hope this helps!"
153693,1,These coordinate with the bedding perfectly. The mother to be already had a set and had these made into pillows.
18761,0,"While this product is better for swaddling than a blanket, we've been more impressed with the SwaddleMe product. We found this item to be a pain at night (when you are half awake). Trying to undo it to change the baby is a pain and then the fact that you have to hold the baby up while wrapping him up in it is also a pain (and can wake a sleeping baby). The SwaddleMe product can be bundled up without waking the baby or moving them much. We were disappointed with the Miracle Blanket and switched back after 2 nights."
133403,2,"I bought these Born Free bottles and nipples, switching away from Avent, mainly b/c of they are bpa-free. The Born Free bottles and nipples are so diappointing in every way. First of all, they are harder to clean (extra 2 piece valve). The bottles leak from the screw on neck. The nipples collapse consistently. Nothing could be more frustrating than dealing with these product issues when you have a hungry baby to feed. Finally, I switched back to the Avent nipples which work on these bottles. If you do buy this product, DON'T invest in the nipples- just use Avent nipples. I am sorry I invested so much $$ in this system..and would just like to warn others on the disappinting performance."
42795,1,"The Moby was a Godsend when my twins were born. It was a little confusing at first learning to tie it (that could have been from the lack of sleep, though). However, the instructions were very helpful, and the color step-by-step pictures helped a LOT!! I could ""wear"" both the girls in it up to their 8th week, and it was amazing how they would just cuddle together and fall asleep in it. I could vacuum, clean up, fold laundry, etc. while I was ""wearing"" them. They are 16 months old now, and my husband and I still ""wear them"" one at a time forward-facing. they love being close to us, and we love being able to carry them free-handed without buckles, clasps, etc. I never tried, though a friend told me it is also useful for discreet nursing."
87068,1,"I guess I didn't read carefully enough in the description. It is very cute and soft, but it is barely bigger than a burp cloth. I think it is for show only as it has no usable function that I can discern. Still, for the discounted price, it is quite sweet and may be a darling little ""woobie"" to carry around one day!"
75318,2,"In these hard and trying economic times, the search for an effective, efficient and reasonably priced breast pump is paramount, and after careful research on amazon i decided to go with this pump.....WHAT A MISTAKE!!! I got ONE USE out of this pump, ONE!!!! half way through my second attempt to use it, the suction stopped and I haven't been able to use it since! I am SO ANNOYED, DISAPPOINTED, and ANGERED! I cannot send it back, and I cannot get a refund. This is so awful! Over a hundred dollars, DOWN THE DRAIN! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PUMP TO ANY MOTHER WHO IS NURSING! NO HELP TO ME AT ALL AND TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY!!!! TWO THUMBS EMPHATICALLY DOWN!!!!!!!!!"
35660,1,"This is wonderful. Don't need to worry about big bulky winter coats or trying to keep blankets on in the car seat. Very safe product. I have two, one for each car seat."
66431,1,"This has been a great help for our infant daughter. She's been in sleepsacks since practically birth. She stays warm and snug and can't kick it off. We only use it at night, so when it goes on, she knows it's bed time. It's part of the routine now. Highly recommended!"
40520,1,"These are great diapers, but not at the new price of $10.49. They were great at $7.49, but they're now cheaper at Target, Sams and many other places, even with tax!!"
26096,0,"I purchased this car seat as a travel system for my daughter in February, 2003. The stroller is great, I had the same one for my son back in 1998 but it was only the stroller at that time. The car seat is great for newborns, it's very padded and keeps them very safe and snugged. The latch system is very easy, I didn't have any problems installing anything. The bad thing is that you won't use it for very long and it practically still looks new when the baby outgrows it so it's really not worth the money but since I purchased it as a travel system, the price was much better than purchasing the car seat alone. I would recommend buying the stroller by itself and purchasing an infant/toddler carseat instead. Also, if you live in a cold weather state, it's very uncomfortable to put a 15 pound baby with their jacket or coat in this carseat. Not worth the money at all."
131682,1,"We just used this potty seat on a 3 week trip across the country. It worked great for my daughter, on all different kinds of toilets in the US,and Mexico,even on the plane toilet. She is confident on this seat as it is very secure on a toilet, unlike the other brands available, and I tried them all before this. The first time I used it I couldn't get it to fit either, until I got out the directions and realized it has to go over the toilet seat with the rim in the front hanging OVER the toilet, and pulled up snug right againnst the toilet. It covers everything your child would touch on a public toilet, and my daughter had plenty of room between the sides of her legs and where the handles are.I use paper potty seat covers that I carry with me in a plastic ziplock bag with the potty seat and put one of those down before the potty seat, so I don't have to clean the potty seat every time it's used, which makes it practical for traveling.I have NOT had any problems with pinching or injuries,because the hinges are covered on this model, unlike the other brands I tried, which fell in or sagged or had moving uncovered hinges which would pinch. This is the best on the market and I've tried them all and this works. I won't give it a 5 star rating, though, because the covered seam hinges, which are necessary to prevent pinching and injury, stand up a bit. This means that if you want your child to slide forward or backward on the potty seat for a better position, you have to pick them up and move them instead of having them slide, or the seams where the covered hinges are could possibly irritate or scrape your child because they stand up. I suspect the woman whose son's bottom bled may have scooted him along the seat against these seams. Is it a perfect seat? No. But if you are aware of the flaws and never slide your child while they are seated on the seat, it really does work on every toilet in several states and Mexico if you read the directions first and be sure you know how to use it before you put your child on it.I do wish Primo would find a way to flatten those seams a bit, but as I said, I tried every other brand out there first and this is the best. Many other brands have uncovered hinge seams, and that is far worse, because then the seat can collapse or unfold at the unlocked, uncovered hinges, and if your child moves at all on that type of seat, they will end up with their bottom caught in the hinges for sure, causing a far more serious injury than an avoidable surface scrape."
47976,1,"I searched and searched for a gate that would work for our dog. I can't say she ""loves"" having to be put behind this gate...but being able to have a clear view sure helps relieve some of her stress. She is pretty hyper...about 20 pounds and once we figured out how to work the gate it holds her even while jumping on it. The other thing we use this for is to just put it up to keep her out of the hallway. We don't install it...we just lean it and for some reason she has never tried to jump on it (probably because its keeping her ""in"" the living room instead of ""out"". This gate has saved our sanity :)"
28688,1,"Within a few days of ordering this item it was delivered. It was the easiest item that I have ever ordered/bought to assemble. The instructions were simple and easy to understand. It took about (20) twenty minutes to put it together. I am well pleased with the price, the product, the shipping and the ease of ordering this item. Thank you very much."
126697,1,"First off, I have tried both Pampers Baby Dry and these Huggies. Somehow I feel Huggies can fit babies up to a largers ""waist line"" than Pampers. Like my baby, when Pampers become tight, Huggies are still right even though they claim to be the same size. Do not understand why Huggies are ususally cheaper than Pampers as to me they are of the same or even better value. Huggiest fit the baby right, no leakage, and really really absorbant. I am a happy consumer.Also my baby is 3 month old now and she is 75-95% persentile in her size and still uses Huggies Size 1-2."
43434,1,This stroller is excellent! when running errands I can simply attach my baby's car seat to this with one click and I'm off without having to wake her from her sleep. The best part about this is that it's lightweight and easy to put up and down. I originally bought a Graco travel system but the stroller is a little too bulky to fit in my car and then having to go shopping it would take up all the space so i figured this stroller frame is what i will use until my baby's old enough to sit up then i can upgrade her car seat and only travel with the stroller.
20049,0,"Long story short... I get backache after about 30 minutes carrying my daughter. I'm in decent shape and my daughter is not obese... so I think getting achy in such a short period of time is not reasonable.It does feel pretty good for the first few minutes with some lumbar support, but then the ache sets in."
115085,2,"It does a great job of trapping my 3 - 6 year olds because they are afraid of breaking it, but my 20 month old just gives it a few good jerks and it opens right up for him. Had less than a week and am now looking for a gate that actually works for a toddler."
179855,1,In my third trimester my husband insisted on buying this pillow. I was not convinced it would help since I used body pillows and two extra pillows for support. I slept so well the first night with this pillow and I was actually able to get out of bed without the excruciating pain I had previously. This was a sleep saver and I still use it to breastfeed my daughter lying down. My back thanks the maker of this product.
91616,1,Very easy to move from one car to another and works really good to put into a small sports car with 4 seats. Very light to carry. Highly recommend it.
166580,0,These diapers are to thin and do not work for my girl who is slender and a little tall. We had to many leaks from the side. Over all I would not buy them again for my daughter but Im still looking for the perfect diaper for her.
153906,1,These wipes have been great. They do not bother my baby's bottom and get her very clean. I like that they are chlorine free and are soothing instead burning.
85965,2,"This model monitor works on 900 mhz which means many electronic devices you have in your house (alarm clock, cordless phone, etc.) will cause static and impair the video and audio reception. I upgraded to the digital model and the reception is perfect."
162403,0,"The only 2 things from this kit that Ive used are the nail clippers and the bulb syringe. The clippers have a longer handle (if that's what you want to call it) but I wish it was a little more ergonomical, like an indent for your finger instead of a bulge. The syringe worked well when my daughter was congested. I keep this kit in her diaper bag that goes with her to her sitter every day. I also can add a few more things in it, like a bottle of Mylecon and Children's Tylenol (just in case she ever needs it), and everything is in one spot."
141499,1,love that it is easy to build. the music is not loud and not annoying. the singer has a soft melodic voice and many of the songs are purely instrumentals. i have no complaints. would gift it to people in the future.
174307,0,"Just before buying these adjusters I'd picked up a pack made by Belkin.I found both to be adequate and can't say either has an edge.The Heininger actually stay attached to the belt between uses, which is a plus. But unsnapping them once properly attached can be tricky. When being used, these adjusters need to be slid to the side of a belt that is pulled tight and low across the lap...which is the proper way to use a belt anyway. If they aren't secured this way, they tend to excessively slide/move along the belt while in use if you happen to move much.The Belkin have a more in-use secure fit, but slip right off the belt when not in use do to their 'open on both sides' design. Also, if you like to wear your belt a little more loosely, these are the better option.Overall, I don't think there is an optimal product for adjusting seat belts out there to date, so this item is no better or worse than others."
15084,2,I loved this at first. But after two months of daily use the thing broke. I cant get it back together. I think I will just go back to walking the diapers to the regular trash outside.
78971,1,These work great with standard bottles. I like that I can order them online with amazon prime so it avoids a trip to the store just for 1 small item.
47674,1,"Ah, I absolutely love Noodle and Boo. While I was pregnant I received a gift set that included this kit among a whole slew of other goodies. I also received countless other bath care products for baby. When my daughter was born I tried California Baby first, which I did like very much. However, once we ran out of California Baby products I tried both this and Burt's Bees Baby products. My husband and I quickly realized this was the winner. The scent is just so wonderful. I often use the lotion on myself. My daughter has fairly sensitive skin and this is just perfect for her. The shampoo leaves her hair literally feeling soft as silk. I cannot stop kissing her head after she bathes. The lotion is not too oily yet very moisturizing. And the body wash keeps that baby soft skin that just demands kisses around the clock. This is a wonderful product to give an expectant momma, and also great to buy for travel. However, I found that for continued use at home, it is much wiser to buy the full size bottles as these small sizes tend to go very fast. Absolutely wonderful products!!"
113561,1,I bought the red one in 2009 and the blue one in 2011. These are livesavers! My babies who refuse to sit in high chairs would learn to sit in those booster seats for the whole meal time. The feeding tray on the blue one I just bought is very loose though. I tried the feeding try from the red one and it worked fine on the blue base tray. I called Fisher-Price and they are shipping out a replacement feeding tray for me for free. I recommended this product to many of my friends and will continue to do so. We bring them everywhere as restaurants highchairs are full of germs that even clorox wipes cannot get rid of. And who wants the chemicals in clorox anyway?! Highly recommend. Great product and great customer service from Fisher Price.
142510,2,"I bought both a splat mat from sugar booger and mimi the sardine. The splat mat from sugar booger is so much better. This one from mimi just looks like someone unrolled a length of fabric and cut it. The mimi one is rectangular while sugar booger is square, but they're pretty much the same size. I can't believe I spent $30 for a piece of fabric I could have cut myself."
63679,1,"Big enough to fit walmart carts and has velcro so it fits perfectly on smaller carts as well. The fabric is strong and padded enough she can fall to the sides and it doesnt hurt. This covers every area the baby can reach and has places to attach toys to keep baby occupied. Its perfect, I love it!!!!!!!! :)"
108476,2,"This is a nice seat -- so comfy my 18-mo-old can use and stable enough that the 3yo also loves it. The handles offer added security for early potty use. We bought two of these to have on eat each toilet. However, the less-used one recently split at the seams! Sadly it's past the return date.The two-piece design is terrific for trapping urine in the little grooves and also the cushy ring often slips off when this is hung up in the bathroom since you have to hang it by one of the little handles.My parents bought theMommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seatand I think it's much comfier, much easier to clean AND it's only $10. Oh, and it also has a hook that makes it super easy for the child to hang it up after use. I'd recommend that one instead."
20575,1,We have had this product for over five months and my now 10 month old still loves jumping in it. It is really durable and we have not had any problems with this product.
55340,0,"I purchased my first Kecci diaper bag 5 years ago when my second son was born. I absolutely loved it and still keep it in my car for spare clothes for the kids and use it when when walk in parks/zoos, etc. But it has seen better days. I decided to order this one to either give as a gift or put in the car for clothes. It is very pretty, but the material is different from the first -- stiffer -- both the outer material as well as the inner lining, which does not seem as thick and durable as my first bag. It also seems a little slimmer -- like it would hold less. It is truly a diaper bag -- does not hold much for bigger kids. I will have to see how it wears though....that will be the true test.... It is great that it still converts from a shoulder strap to a backpack -- it's very handy to be able to do that and is one of the reasons why I loved this bag so much..."
98693,1,We purchased this car seat for my 2 year son after doing a lot of research on the available seats with the 5 point harness. With this seat you can use the 5 point harness up to 80 pounds. My son is 38 pounds at 2 years old so I wanted a seat that would be very safe and last for a few years. He thanks us everyday for the seat as he is much more comfortable in it. It's much larger than our last seat but fits great in the back of my 2004 Honda Accord and my husband's 2007 Ford Explorer. It is worth the price seeing how comfortable and knowing how much safter he is in this seat! Remember that 5 point harness seats should be used for children for as long as possible. A 5-point harness is an undeniably safer option than a booster seat that uses a lap and shoulder belt restraint. Thank you to the family of Kyle Miller for sharing all of their knowledge about car seats in memory of their son.
71100,1,Great price and I don't have to go shopping at the mall. We use it daily and my 4 months old nephew loves it.
176333,0,"I had premature twins I was pumping for in NICU and this was more in my budget. I didn't expect to have to use it after they came home, but its looking like they aren't going to get the hang of breast feeding. I don't mind the noise and the motor is still working after two months of using it 6-8 times a day, but it seems I am getting a lot less milk with it now than in the beginning, so maybe the motor is getting weaker. I went and bought an Isis and I use both at the same time, and I get much more milk much faster with the Isis. If I had it to do again I'd have bought the Pump in Style. This pump really is for occasional use only. And even for that, I'd buy the Isis. Its cheaper, will last longer, is quiet and does just as good a job if not better. Its only downfall is more pieces to figure out and wash."
11694,0,"This inflatable tub was perfect! A good size, no frills, and a suction cup that worked well for mounting it to the shower wall when we were finished using it. It worked great, until we started noticing slow leaks. We'd super glue one, only to find another a few weeks later. Time to buy a new tub.*Update - all the other tubs have the same negative reviews about splitting seams over time. Since this tub worked so well for us until it split and we love the suction cup, we just bought another one. Ah well."
160649,1,"What I liked most about this crib sheet is that its made of a type of plastic on top, which is great for those accidents. I'd rather it stay on top of the bed than have it soak all the way through to the mattress which causes more of a mess to clean up. I found it to be such a great product, that I recommend it to my friends who are pregnant and my sister in law etc."
65283,1,"A must-have for every B.O.B., but it should be included with the stroller, or at least be half the price. Fits and works great, and I would buy it again (but I would still be annoyed)."
118915,2,"I actually had to return the high chair, as there were several defects. There were cracks in the wood, rough spots that should have been better sanded and inconsistencies and haziness in the finish."
116684,0,"Despite the description stating that there is no drilling required, the first tool listed in the instructions as necessary to complete installation: a drill! And no question you will need it. Putting that aside, this is a well made lock and works once it is installed. Just be careful if you have a tall door; my wife cannot reach the mechanism without a step stool."
14560,2,"I got these bottles as a gift and they were horrible!!! I had originally used Evenflo bottles that I had purchased before my daughter arrived. I went crazy with these bottles too!!! NOBODY sells the nipples for these bottles. My baby needed to use a thickend formula(Enfamil AR LIPIL is great!)But the formula would not flow through the stage 1 of the Evenflo brand. I had to enlarge the nipples myself because I couldn't find the stage 2 nipples anywhere. Only stage 1- and why would they even just sell those, they came with the bottles. So I enlarged it to only be annoyed. Some were bigger some smaller. So I then tried the Avent. They were HORRIBLE!! My baby was spitting up all day long and screaming. It says on the bottle to help colic, it caused COLIC. My husband was so annoyed he threw them out!!! I had to order the stage 2 from Evenflo and they told me it would take 3 weeks!! What a NIGHTMARE!! I am now going to try Playtex Ventaire. Hope I have better luck with these. At least I know my local grocery store sells the bottles and nipples. I live too far away from the stores to go driving all over for nipples. Oh and by the way, the Playtex Ventaire comes with both size nipples. I can't wait to try these!"
157125,1,"I originally purchased an inexpensive evenflo single breast pump. I pump mainly to store milk for those times when I am away from my son for the day and to mix with his rice cereal. With a baby, time is limited and I was frustrated with how inefficient the evenflo was. I LOVE the pump-in-style. FYI-the only difference between the traveler and the pump-in-style advance is the bag. The motor is the same (according to the Babies-R-Us employee who helped me). If you value your time, don't waste your money on an inexpensive pump."
30065,1,Just perfect for our baby. No more colics after heating....15 seconds can make a difference! Life saver...please try this before giving chemicals to your baby
40893,1,"I like these diapers a lot. They work really well for my super-pooper, skinny leg boy. I can recommend them wholeheartedly."
12505,0,"Everything fit perfectly except the naills/bolts that came with it were not the standard length. Had to use the ones that I removed from the crib assembly, hence 3 stars."
169913,1,"We're quite pleased with this crib, especially for the price. It's sturdy and attractive. Setup was easy enough. No problems or complaints. If you like the looks of this one, get it. There's no sense spending more money on a crib."
172683,0,"I registered for and received this item as a gift. I was most interested in the shower feature. During the second use, the shower quit working. I found the problem and fixed it. During the fourth use the shower quit working, and I could not fix it. I contacted the company and they are sending a new shower unit to me at no charge. They responded to my complaint quickly. At this point I am disappointed in the product, but pleased with the response of the company's customer service department. I can only hope the new unit works for an extended period of time."
117117,0,"I am not a girlie girl so I thought this bag would be a nice fit for me. I know this is made for men and that is apparent for sure when a buxom broad tries to wear it across the chest like it is designed. I like the style, but it is nowhere near large enough, especially if you have two young ones in diapers. If I bottle fed instead of breast feeding, there is no way I would have room for bottles and formula. I give it a 4 for style, but a 2 for functionality so overall, it is only a 3 star at best."
91502,1,"I have no major complaints with this moniter... only that it does make a mildly annoying buzzing noise. Also, we have been using it for about three months now, and it's beginning to make a strange noise that sounds like our son is whining on the other end. It's not the batteries running low or anything, because we use the outlet."
168091,1,"Ever have a crying baby and you are thinking to yourself, is it a hunger cry? Too tired? Wet diaper?This product puts peace of mind your hands with a fantastic wetness indicator from front to back that is yellow when dry and blue when wet. Taking one of the 3 main reasons that the baby is crying out of the equation just makes our lives as parents that much easier.Our daughter has had a couple of 'blowouts' but never anything that this diaper could not handle so far in her first 2 months. She has used these diapers from birth in the hospital until today and they have worked great. I highly recommend this diaper for all parents, couple this with a reasonable Amazon price and the 'Amazon Mom' program (even for the dads like me out there); you end up with a great all around buy. Sign up for regular delivery of these at a frequency that meets your family's needs and you'll thank yourself later."
78931,1,Love this and that it works so great. Only complaint is how it is difficult to put on and take off repeatedly. I still use it cause it is better then nothing and easier then lugging around a stroller and carseat.
146332,1,"After reading many reviews from this and other versions of Jumperoo, I felt that the Rain forest jumperoo would best fit my 4 month old son. I ordered it,, and when it came two days later, I was so happy. Assembly was very fast and easy. My son's bright eyes opened wide and sparkled when he saw the lights dancing to the jungle music! He is about 25 inches, so his tippy-toes barely touch the floor (yet), but no worries. He played with all the gadgets for a good 20 minutes. It will only get better, as he grows. Superb choice!!! The only reason a didn't give it 5 stars, is becauseI only had the product for a couple of hours.****UpdateMy son snow 8 months and he love this Jumperoo even more! He jumps and laughs! Wonderful ... Happy baby and happy mom!"
168835,1,"These diapers are the best disposable diapers you could ever buy for your baby. My baby has sensitive sking so we mainly use cloth diapers but for daycare she needs disposables and these are the only ones that dont make her get a rash. Huggies are just useless for my baby. If you do a side by side comparison of this diaper versus your regular Huggies snug and dry you can see and feel and smell the difference. These are so much softer and gentler on the skin. We used this on our baby from the hospital and then we tried huggies when she was about 3 months because we received so many boxes of huggies, after just one day of using huggies, her poor little bottom was covered red bumps, so we returned all of them to the store and bought more of these pampers swaddlers.Like all other disposable diapers these diapers do leak sometimes especially if you dont double check around the thighs to make sure the ruffles have been properly pulled out. These are still the best disposable diapers."
41069,2,"I have always love the pampers cruisers, because they did keep my baby dry and they didn't leak... not any more Pampers have now taken out the wonderful mesh liner that is still on the picture, and now I can't stand them. We live in the high desert and so my daughter drinks more than if we lived anywhere else in the country. Now I haven't had one diaper, no matter how long it is on, that hasn't leaked. I am so disappointed. Don't waste your money, because if you don't like the baby dry, that is what your paying the higher price for now. I wish I could have given them no stars, used to be 5."
147304,1,"This thing is really easy to set up and take apart if you read the instructions first. My husband refused and it seriously took us an hour to put it together b/c things kept turning out to be backwards, etc. I finally got fed up, fetched the manual and we were done shortly after. Then when we went to roll it into our bedroom, it wouldn't fit through the door! It was actually pretty funny and not a big deal since we knew how easy it was to set up. It wasn't a problem for us that it wouldn't fit through the door, because all of the bedrooms in our house were upstairs, but if we'd been on one floor, I would have wanted to be able to move this from room to room without breaking it down. The changing table is awesome, although I wish there was more storage room around that little diaper stacker. The sounds and lights are great but the battery dies quickly. I think we changed ours every few weeks. But I love that it detaches for easy transition to the crib or for a roadtrip or something."
73894,1,"This was given to me as a gift. Helped me keep track of feedings, diaper changes and more importantly when and how long my little guy was asleep. It's become a standard baby shower gift for my friends."
53959,2,"Skip on this product. Unless the interior of your car / van is a perfect square, it is almost impossible to attach the mirror in an angle to let you see your child. The light, a nice idea, is poorly implemented making it worthless and in the way when taking your seat in and out of the car, plus the remote that turns light on and off must be in direct line of sight or it won't work, and finally the clip to hold the remote on your sun visor won't fit many types of cars with thicker visors that house vanity mirrors and the like."
182770,1,Great price for a very basic car seat. The cushion is thin but my son does not seem to notice or care. My only complaint is that the harness is very hard to tighten.
41867,1,"This is a fabulous product that allows you to not worry about having a blanket handy when there is a breeze or the air conditioning is too cold. The only negative about the Bundle Me product is that it is far too small. We were unable to zip it after my son was two months old. Fortunately, it was summer so we just tucked it around him. It should be redesigned so that infants can use it until they exceed 27 or 28 inches, which is the limit for most infant carriers."
175624,0,"Bought this for my grandson but if your baby needs to be swaddled, a receiving blanket will do just as well."
25472,1,at first i thought these liners were too big because they stick out of the sides of the diaper but the generous sizing prevents the solid waste from getting on the sides of the diaper. they're a little hard but my daughter doesn't seem to mind.
67422,0,"We have been using this system for a year and finally are going to get rid of it as our son is outgrowing it. I regret purchasing the stroller every time I look at it. I NEVER used it a stroller alone, always only as a base for the carseat. Wasted money for sure. The stroller is SOOOO heavy, the triangular handle is a great idea, but don't count on being able to use it. Unless you plan on strolling around with an empty stroller. With a diaper bag, a car seat and a baby you can forget about one handed use. It's hard enough with two hands. The front wheels don't spin around easily. Next problem. It so big, it and handful of grocery bags is all that fits in my sedan's trunk. Next problem. Everytime you fold it, the front tray hits the ground and scratches immediately. Horrible design. And it's heavy. Also, wheels started squeeking after a shot period of time. I really really really hate this stroller. I have nothing good to say about it.The car seat has worked ok for us. It rated safer than other carseats, so we chose it for that reason and were happy with it from safety standpoint. Also, straps are easy to use and adjust. Base is easy to move from one car to the next. Done it 10 seconds including walking from car to car. Ok, now the list of problems. It's SOOO SOOO SOOO heavy. I am in a great shape and carry my 20 pounder around in one hand all the time for extended periods of time, but I could not carry the car seat with the baby in it when he was half the weight. Again, great design for the triangular handle, it allows for a choice on how to hold the handle, BUT, unless you're a guy (Or a woman with super duper muscles), you won't use it much. I used both arms to carry him short distances just to move him to the stroller or a shopping cart. Next. The material is very good looking but impractical. My guy sweats in it like crazy and he is not a sweaty baby. The car seat is the only place he gets sweaty. I put a cloth diaper underneath him and it helps some with the sweating. One thing I hate about this car seat most is the handle. So hard to switch positions, it's crazy. I always feel like swearing when I have to do this and strugle even after one year of using it. One or the other side unlocks but get them unlocked simultaniously on the first try. Good luck with that.I also had the opportunity to deal with baby trend customer service and it was rather sad. They sent me bent front wheel. No way that thing could bend like that during shipping. It's a strong axle. Anyway, so I call the customer service and after 15 minutes of giving them this and than number from the stroller they said they will call back. Never did. So, I call back couple days later. They say ""sure we can send you a new wheel, what is your credit card number?"" So, I said you either send me a new wheel or I'll send the whole thing back (which means waste for them, returned baby items like that cannot be resold). So, they sent me a new wheel at the end. Not a very good customer service, huh?Even though the car seat has problems, it is safe and overall not bad. I would give it 4 stars, but would not buy it again though.The stroller is a one star for sure. Hate that thing."
24659,1,"It's been less than a year and now for some reason we're having a really hard time closing 2 of the 3 gates (the ones weuse most often). Not sure why this is, but we have to bang really hard to get the gates to close. We tried fiddling around with it, reinstalling, but still stiff and hard to close. We have another Dreambaby automatic closing gate that was not that great to start with but that at least performed the same for 4 years.Original Review:First of all, love Amazon. My 2 gates arrived in one day with prime shipping!This really is the best doorway gate you can buy. Very sturdy, easy to install, even comes with a wrench! I have had several other gates (ones I bought and hand-me-downs) and this is by far the best because 1)it stays open when you don't need it (like when kids are napping) - i used to have to tie my other one open! 2)It is also nearly impossible for a toddler to get through because you need downward weight to open it. 3) Other tension gates I have (dreambaby extra wide gate) worked fine, but it was really tough to get it just right so that both parts latched/locked correctly without being so tight that it wouldn't latch. This one was a breeze, as long as it is tight, it works, latching perfectly in both places.I have the older version of this gate and it is much better than the newer version. It had an actual knee plate and it had a wide, sloped base which seems to provide more stability and prevented toes from kicking into the base. The Amazon photo is incorrect and one of the pics shows the older version, which they do not seem to make anymore. Even with the changes for the worse, I think this is still the best doorway gate out there and well worth the money."
99479,1,I am always looking for the best prices on diapers. I like these overnight diapers - they work for us - we always use one size larger than our daily diapers and that seems to work.
87302,1,"my daughter would not take the bottle and I only had 3 days to find a bottle that she would take so i could put her in daycare. The only time she would cry is when i would try to feed her with a bottle, then i found this nipple and she took it with out a peep. I am not a fan of the bag bottles but you have to use what works. and this works."
162275,1,"This changing table was very easy to assemble and looks really nice. I was able to put it together by my self while I was pregnant. The problem is that the screws tend to come loose, so every time I move the table (by scooting it on the carpet) I have to tighten the screws or it wobbles. The changing table is comfortable for my little one, and she likes to grab onto the rails when I am changing her (although, that could be an issues for an older child)."
40245,1,I personally think these are the best diapers and are worth every penny. I refuse to purchase any other brand after using Pampers.
129400,1,"Surprisingly, this is my daughter's teether of choice. It is very soft and easily manipulated and she loves to play with it using her feet. Though she constantly drops it on herself, it never registers with her because it's so soft and pliable. She studies it from all angles and really works her motor skills transferring it from hands to feet and back. This toy is a must-have!"
32359,2,"We bought 2: The first broke during a baby shower within the first week. The second lock did not last until the end of the month. Even when the person knew how to open it, the sticky part would unstick and detach from the toilet pretty easily."
112417,1,"I love these diapers on my baby. They have a nice,pleasant scent, they fit well and handle large loads well. I will definitely be buying these again."
64343,1,"We were so glad to buy this backpack on the advice of a friend. Other slings and strollers can't compare. Our daughter loves using her backpack. We use it on the beach and hiking and often get comments from other parents who wish they had the same thing to carry their child in! Our daughter likes it so much that we sometimes take her for walks at night in the pack. Often, she puts her head down on her arm and falls asleep in the backpack. Overall a great buy. The only problem I had was that the instructions were difficult for me to figure out - but not something that would have kept me from purchasing."
159960,0,"I purchased this gate because I could mount it on brackets in a high traffic area. It is true the self adjusting gate has to keep being adjusted. I found if I close it with a slight slant instead of even straight across then I don't have to keep adjusting it. The manufacturing could provide brackets for the other side so it would close in the correct place each time and then you wouldn't have to keep adjusting it. It wouldn't swing both ways but you wouldn't have to mess with it every time you walk through it.As I said I don't think there are any easy gates out there. They all seem to be difficult to open and close and with good reason, we don't want our children to be able to open them. But my major problem with this gate is that the top bracket cracked right off. Their brackets are cheaply made and could not with stand the weight of the gate. I had to pay $4.00 for them to send me new brackets. There is only a 90 day warranty so I guess they don't stand behind their product if it is defective."
77384,1,"This swing was worth every penny for us during my child's first few months. Our daughter had acid reflux and laying her down after feedings was not an option. She was able to sleep soundly in this swing every day and night until her reflux went away. The cover is super soft and easily washable and now that my daughter is 5 months old, she still loves to lay in the swing to look at herself in the mirror and watch the mobile. I highly recommend this swing to all parents!"
75254,1,"It is so difficult to shop for a breast pump. If you buy one, you are stuck with it. You can't return pumps ... not even to Target or Walmart. So, hopefully, this will be a helpful review.I researched quite a bit before choosing this pump. For my needs, it works great. It is very quiet and very efficient. There are only a few parts, so cleaning and assembly is very easy. It is very simple - one dial for suction and one dial for speed. I have been using it semi-daily for a month now and have not had any difficulties.It works on A/C adapter or on batteries. I am not a full-time pumper; I just use it once or twice a day to increase production and have a little milk stored for emergency or super-hungry-baby days.It is quiet enough that I can pump on one side while nursing the baby on the other. I love that you don't need to clean the tubing ... all parts that come in contact with the milk are easily cleaned/sanitized.Also, Avent makes a conversion kit (available on Amazon and at Babies R Us for about $10) so that you can pump directly into Avent bottles rather than transferring the milk into bags, etc. Works GREAT!If you are totally new to pumps, here's my advice: skip the manual or single pumps. I had the Isis manual pump for my first baby and that was a complete waste of money. I would sit and pump for 20-30 minutes and could barely get two ounces. Electric pumps are so much more efficient. Spend the extra money and get a good pump. It helps increase your milk production and can help with sore nipples."
2522,2,I have been usage the Size 2 for my son and he is still breastfeeding and so his BMs are still pretty runny. These diapers were terrible!- the poop leaked straight THROUGH the diapers- not leaking out the sides- THROUGH! That meant that there was no way that he could stay clean through a BM! Which is very annoying.
48200,2,"Upon receipt of the sheets, I read the description indicating the sheet is 65% polyester and 35% cotton. The description for the item provided by Arm's Reach and sold by Baby Bungalow state made of 100% cotton. Very disappointing. Between the cost and the shipping, this product is substandard.Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Fitted Sheet"
64117,0,I thought this was the Pearhead album that fits any size photo - but it is not.
54637,1,"I registered for this mobile and rec'd it after our daughter was born. We expected her to be in a craddle for awhile, but when that didn't work and she was in her crib after being only a week old--this mobile was a lifesaver!! She loved it then and still loves it now (she is 2 months). She talks to the animals and giggles and kicks her feet. I do only use it for play time--then I swing it off to the side for bed time. I can't complain about the noises since I want it to be lively and for her to enjoy it. It has made taking a shower much more bearable, because I know I can put her in her crib and turn it on and she is set until the music stops. Just love it!!"
147372,0,I was really looking forward to having a monitor so I could see my son at night. When I started using it the monitor had lines running through the picture and I couldn't hear anything. The manufacturer said that it doesn't work when you have a wireless network. I was really disappointed so I sent it back. I bought the Handheld Color Video Monitor by Summer Infant. It works great with my wireless network and my 2.4 Ghz phones. It doesn't work very good with other 900Mhz phones or controls according to the manual.
113589,1,"This booster seat just made my ""must have"" list for babies/toddlers! Our daughter would always bend over and suck on the table when she was in restaurant high chairs and the only place to put her food was on the table where we worried about cleanliness but this booster seat turns any chair into a highchair and every surface they're touching is their own!Not only from a hygiene standpoint, this chair is super easy to attach and even easier to clean!"
72687,2,"Born Free Stage 1 Nipples- Twin PackWe had a baby in 12/07 and bought all new Dr. Brown bottles for him. Then we heard about BPA and switched to Born Free to get BPA free bottles. However, the Born Free nipples collapse with vigorous sucking and frustrate the baby. We found this with the 12 nipples we bought so it couldn't have been just one bad batch. My husband bought new Dr. Brown nipples and tried them on the Born Free bottles. They fit! He saved the day! We tossed the Born free nipples and now use our Born Free bottles with Dr. Brown nipples of the corresponding size. Works great."
34936,1,This car seat is perfect. It is large but it fits fine in my van. My son was born 3 and a half weeks early and was 6 pounds 12 ounces so I did use an infant carrier but once he turned 10 pounds I put in in the Alpha Omega and he fits fine. I would recommend this car seat to everyone!
28317,1,I bought this chair set when I was pregnant. I find it is very comfort for a pregnant woman and a breast-feeding mom.
132263,2,"I am extremely disappointed with the Vintage French Pink Toile lamp Shade. The pattern is upside down and the quality is poor. I would not put it in my grand daughter's bedroom. I wish to return it and have my money refunded. Please advise if you can assist me. I have never been disappointed with the quality of Amazon products until now. Hopefully, you can assist me in returning this product and restore my confidence in the products Amazon sponsors.Unhappy, Marguerite Verone"
13491,1,"This is simple to install, but great at keeping my little ones safe, from playing with the cords. Great price. It also has helped make our spider web of cords coming from the TV, and gaming systems more manageable."
55630,2,"My husband bought this warmer from one of the chain baby stores and I was really excited to use it. We wanted a reliable warmer for the transition from breast to bottle for our son. Well, it warms the bottle great, just not the milk! I use this multiple times a day, and I still don't have it down. I have tried everything from smaller bottles to more water to warming the bottle twice. I almost always end up with a bottle that is hot and milk that is not. Of course, by the time I get the temperature right, my poor son is sobbing and thinks I have deserted him.... I have learned to avoid this awful feeling by setting up the warmer just before he wakes from his naps (he is still breastfeeding at night) and adjusted it accordingly. I have to say, this takes all of the convenience out of the warmer. I am sure there is a better warmer out there, I just haven't brought myself to purchasing one for fear of the same results..."
152771,1,I have been very pleased with this purchase. It is very roomy and the kids love them! My only complaint is that I wish it had some sort of strap to keep it sitting in the seat. It does not move around too much that it is a problem...it would be nice for it to be a little sturdier!
11687,1,"I ordered this for my seven month old since we currently only have a stand up shower. It fits properly in the bottom of it. She does great in it and there's lots of room for her to grow. And even though it's pretty small for her, my 3 year old likes taking baths in it too."
125848,2,"Huggies brand diapers always seem to have more leakage than any other brand. I've also noticed that they seem to fall apart easier, and leave bits of material on the baby's skin. I've used many brands, and found that this is not one of the best for my daughter."
130687,1,"My daughter loves this swing. We are able to change the position to give her different views of the room and the recline position is perfect.The fish on our swing stopped rotating after having the swing for 4 months, I called Fisher Price and they sent us a replacement via UPS free of charge. Great customer service!!"
179699,2,"I bought this for as we were travelling extensively overseas for over a months and needed to take a car seat for our 18 months old daughter. I had to travel 2 legs with her by myself with this thing and by the second time I was ready to throw it out the window. This is an item you want to test in the store with your specific car seat. The ledge the car seat sits on in tiny and the slightest bump or movement can get it out of alignment which means you have to take the little one out and put it on again. It is almost impossible (unlike advertised) to do it with the baby in it when you are by yourself. It's to heavy and bulky. Maybe it works better with other car seats but if you have a Britax Marathon, DON'T waste your money on this. It created more hassle than it was worth. Also, it doesn't fit through all air plane aisles which again, when you are travelling alone with the little one, creates a whole new set of challenges!"
112400,1,"Lots of diapers...decent price, and they came in about 3-5 days not the 14+ that was originally stated. I believe the overall price is a tad bit higher than Sam's Club, but with free shipping and not having to drive 12 miles to the nearest Sam's, I saved that difference in gas and then some."
183524,0,"I baby-proofed every sharp edge in my living room with this tape, and it does the job. It's a bit difficult to apply, and the adhesive is not super-strong, which is good if you don't want to permanently baby-proof your furniture, but bad if your baby decides it's a fun toy, because they can pull it right off. Also hard to put around corners, but I got around it by cutting a slit where it went around the edge."
84380,1,"My little one LOVES his new swing! He'd sit and swing all day if I let him! I like that this swing has a recline feature to let him sit tilted slightly back, since he is just learning to sit up. The tray gives him a great place to hold on if he wants to, and it's a great place to give him a snack if we're outside having a ""picnic"" with my older son (while the swing it stopped, of course!) This swing really delivers!"
137201,0,"My baby, too, had no trouble picking up this plate and tossing it. It's a cute plate, but isn't amazingly throw-resistant like they make it out to be. Spoons are cute, though."
11048,1,"This is a good basic booster seat for kids. It is not as good as some other brands out there that have the ability for the seat to &#34;suction&#34; onto the regular chair that it sits on. This booster just sits on top of the regular chair, instead of being suctioned on and a tiny bit more secure."
156034,0,"I brought this product for my 7 months old Granddaughter earlier part of December 2011. It is OK, but she doesn't seem to use it much as other teething products I have for her personal use. Its more on the hard side then soft, although some babies may like their teething rings hard, she likes more soft flexiable things to bite on. So as of right now this isn't to useful for her, who knows about later. I want to state this the third Munchkin product I used for her and I am not to happy with their products. Unless giving to me I don't believe I would purchase any other of their products. I hope others have more success with thir products. Thanks!"
179027,1,Used these for my first grandson and now for 2 more coming next month. These were easy to clean and never had trouble with the baby sucking to much air.
114322,1,"We love this booster seat. We have 2 of them (purchased the 1st one somewhere else). We got the 1st one when our now 10 month old son was just starting solids at 6 months, hoping to buy time to research high chairs. We like the booster seat so much we decided we didn&#8217;t need a high chair. We got a 2nd one as a &#8220;traveling&#8221; booster seat. For the price, this booster seat rocks! The colors are nice and the seat doesn&#8217;t take over the dining room like a high chair would. Plus, it&#8217;s easier to clean -- there aren&#8217;t any nooks and crannies that hide crumbs or other messes.The only complaints I have are not really complaints about the booster seat as much as maybe arguments for a high chair:-When my son tilts his head back when sitting in this seat (e.g., out of excitement or when drinking from his sippy cup if it&#8217;s not full), he doesn&#8217;t have very far to go before hitting his head on the back of the real chair. I generally put a blanket or burp cloth on the back of the real chair so that his head hits something soft and not the bare wood. I could also solve this problem by raising the booster seat about a foot, but then I wouldn&#8217;t be able to pull him up to the dining room table.-The booster seat has a hard seat and isn&#8217;t as cushy as some of the padded high chairs. It doesn&#8217;t seem to bother my son now, but once he starts speaking, we&#8217;ll see what he has to say."
138647,1,"I recently gave the Turtle Constellation Nightlight as a baby shower gift. One of the guests said it perfectly -- ""Oh, that is my all-time favorite thing.

I highly recommend this unusual gift for a special child in your life.Cloud b Twilight Turtle - Constellation Night Light"
33730,0,"You should be aware that Consumers' Reports recommends against this type of gate, because the folding diamonds of the main gate section can pinch fingers, heads, and everything else. Might be fine where you're going to keep a constant eye, but not the best option for a high-usage area where you expect the containment to keep the kid safe..."
70048,0,"I still use this model because it has clear reception. However I need a low battery indicator. I could not tell when the batteries went dead. Being a first time mom and not hearing a peep, I decided to check on my child anyway, only to discover that my child had been upstairs screaming to the point that he was loosing his breath. With a two story house I did not hear him and I still feel guilty that I wasn't there for my child. Now I always check because I don't have ""peace of mind"" when it comes to the batteries going dead."
82590,1,"I've this carseat for my then 3 yrs old son. We got it much cheaper that time. He fell in love with the seat since we show him. The fabric is very comfortable but a bit too warm for our climate(Thailand). With the brand Recaro i've no doubt about the safty. What i also like most is when he sleep his head never collapse, the wing support his head and the seat lean at the right angle that i've never seen his head fall down.i take one star out because the plastic's frame's good but a little less quality than i expected."
156009,1,"Nothing like a happy baby chewing on such a safe, colorful play toy to relive the discomfort of teething toy."
171014,1,"This stroller makes sense. It offers shade from the sun, a reclining seat, is durable, has all the necessary safety features, and does not cost an arm and a leg. I've shopped around, and am so glad to have finally found a stroller that fits all my needs."
182823,1,"My 2 year old was having issues with waking up wet, needing a bath, clean jammies and clean bedding, we have found that the Huggies overnights are the only diaper that allows the entire family an undisturbed nights rest, they are difficult to find in our area but worth the extra work to find"
34282,2,"Let me first state that JL Childress does NOT advertise that the Britax Advocate CS will fit in this travel bag. However, a review I read shared how excited they were that it did in fact fit! I don't want others to have this same false hope we had...it does not even come close to fitting! In doing a little more research, I discovered that JL Childress does offer a custom car seat bag.=) Their customer service can provide all the details."
104376,0,"i found this very difficult to install with the mounting cups. gave up on them despite the instructions that say to always use them. tore a little paint off the walls remving the mounting cups that were adhered with the included double sided tape. this was easier to install in a framed doorway were i could keep the ends lined up more easily.i like my kidco gates better. easier to install, don't require mounting cups, latch is more complicated (which i think means more child-proofed). the kidco does not swing shut so it can be left open when my little guy is asleep. not good to leave it open when he is awake as he loves to swing it and bang it around.the dream baby gate latch is a little switch that has to be held back while lifting the gate to swing. the kidco latch has a button to be pushed while rasing the handle. you can then let go of the handle and lift and swing the gate. i like the kidco latch better. it seems to be easier for me and my 6 year old, but somehow seems like it would be more difficult for the baby to figure out - if he could reach it.i like the height of both gates. but, keep in mind that the height it may interfere with door handles. only a problem if you want to be able to close a door completely."
49945,1,"I love my Pliko! It started with the infant seat, then the Aria (didn't match though, but still a great stroller!), and now we have the Pliko.A few things I love about this stroller are the* wheels- They are huge and the suspension is great!* size- this stroller is very narrow. It's perfect for shopping and navigating through the racks.* ease- It's not extremely easy to push this stroller with one hand, but it is possible.* basket- It's big enough to hold my purse and various baby items.* recline- The seat reclines to almost completely flat. Personally, I prefere the slight incline. It's great for babies with reflux.* child tray- The child tray has a cup holder, but the best thing is that it is completely removable for &quot;discrete&quot; diaper changes.* pattern- The pattern totally gender nuetral. It's also ver easy to keep clean.** I also love how the car sear locks into the stroller. It feels very sturdy.A few things that could be improved are* instructions- They are not very helpful, it's almost a trial and error experience.* footrest- I have yet to learn how to adjust it.* The canopy is far from see throughThis stroller has met all of my needs. I can not wait to use it on the next baby- when there is one. Not only am I comfortable using it, but my daughter is comfortable riding/sleeping in it! It is definetly worth the money, which is why I don't understand how it could possibly have a rating under five stars."
101519,1,"I have yet to use this bag, but I think it's a marvellous design and will attach it soon to my stroller, once the weather warms up."
184549,1,We ordered this lamp for our infant son's room and love it! It's made very well- and the best thing is that he can use it in his room for years and years to come. It's timeless. Very well made and classy.
6757,1,"Cruisers are by far the best diapers, but the price at Amazon is very high. I buy them at Kroger for 7.99$ on special and Kroger has special coupons for 3$ off, so I end up paying 4.99$ :) .I have not had a better deal anywhere."
61108,0,"I have yet to try the diaper champ so I can only draw off of my experience with the genie. I am a nanny of twin boys and have babysat too many kids to count. My first experience with the Diaper Genie made me loath it. The girl I babysat for had the stinkiest diapers and the room was filled with diaper odor. The kind that makes you want to vomit. I don't know if they didn't change it enough or what, but it was REAL BAD. The family I nanny for now has one and when it gets about half full, it can stink up the room pretty good too.THE POSITIVES are it isn't a fully opened diaper pail so the odors could be worse. It is easy to operate once you are shown but is hard to do with a screaming baby wanting your undivided attention. It's hard to tie the top of the bag after cutting it because you work with such a small piece, but it is so easy it isn't frustrating. The frustrating part is carrying a caterpillar of weight to the garbage and praying both ends are tied securely. I'm sorry but after a poopy diaper sits in there for a few days THERE WILL BE ODORS on the way to the trash. All in all, DON""T pass it up, it is a pretty good system just be aware it isn't perfect"
159726,1,"We put our son in this bouncy chair when he was only a couple days old and we used it until he was four or five months old (he just got to big and heavy for it). While he didn't seem too interested with the toy bar with the fish, he loved the comfort and vibration of the bouncy chair. I only have a few negatives--the toy bar is too far away for a small infant to look at and the chair isn't very well padded. I always placed a blanket on it, so our son would be a little more cozy. I would recommend this bouncy chair for your newborn baby--it is an essential piece to your must have items."
70498,1,"The product is superb. Excellent quality materials and construction. Assembly was simple. Folding it down is easy. Even pushing it is effortless, can easily be done with one hand. It's super comfortable for my little one and sturdy/ durable. It's also quite chic and stylish. Literally every time we go out with it, we get compliments. Even though it is a bit bulky, it's easy to handle and we never leave home without it. I even took on a trip when my little and I traveled alone together. It's that easy to manage! Needless to say I am extremely happy with the purchase and feel that it is well worth the price."
150622,1,"I was very satisfied with the speedy shipping and the excellent condition of this Schwinn Free Runner Jogging Stroller (Blue/Gray). I couldn't have made my daughter and my one year old grandson happier. It is very comfortable for my 5'1"" daughter to jog behind due to the adjustable handle. My grandson is always so relaxed and happy when they return, except when he is sound asleep."
82653,1,"Shipping took longer than expected. But, well worth the wait. Very soothing for my son while he sleeps. The fact that it plays 4 different sounds is really nice becuase it offers more variety."
145509,1,My mom ordered this for my son before he was born. He started using it when he was about 3 mths old (we put a blanket or some burp cloths in to help him sit better when he was little). He's 5 mths old now and he still loves it! He will bounce for about 45 mins at a time :) Helped to develop his strong leg muscles. He also loves the music. We made up lyrics to go along! Get it for yourself or give it as a gift...they will love it!
162915,1,"This is a very sturdy dresser. I love the deep rich finish of the cherry wood. It matches the crib and changing table perfectly. It could a long time to put together and was very hard for me to do. I couldn't see putting it together by myself. You can't use an electic drill, you have to hand screw in all 90+ screws. The predrilled holes are shallow and it takes a long time to screw them all in. But it makes the product very sturdy. I don't mind spending three hours putting a dresser together as long as it's worth it and this is worth it."
122745,2,"I'll just ADD to the other reviews, but I must complain about the harness buckles.1. Safety harness/belt buckles - my wife's finger was bleeding recently - that's how hard they are. Extremely hard to open and close.2. Reclining back rest. There are three positions and you need to pull up a locking handle behind the back rest, then recline. Almost impossible to adjust - it gets stuck, you need to use force, it then ""snaps"" into the new position. Don't even try to change the angle with baby in the seat - you may hurt the baby when it snaps.3. The removable plastic food tray. It arrived slightly deformed. It's not completely flat, so it wobbles in its base and makes noise.4. Static. Because the chair is entirely made of hollow plastic parts - it's like a static dust and hair magnet."
39762,2,"I completely agree with the other reviewer who had trouble because I had exactly the same problem. This item worked great for a few weeks, the baby loved it! Unfortunately it started shutting off after only moments of use and everytime I turned it back on I had to turn the volume back up. There is definitely a manufacturing problem since I'm not the only one to have this problem. The idea is great and if it worked the way it did in the beginning, I would highly recommend it."
134316,1,"So, we bought this nifty nursery tool and have been using it for a while now! It's one of those items that doesn't really get on your nerves, but good to have and keep the wipes warm 24/7... I gave it 4 stars, because it does have a few quirks! If you leave the warmer open, it will dry the wipes and become cold... When you pull the wipes out, be sure to pull it out slowly and you'll have a continuous flow of ""Easy Grabs"". If not, you'll have to open the warmer and just grab from there. Which can get annoying, because the wipes are stuck together. Lastly, the wipes on the bottom burns. Makes it turn yellow and hard. Over all, it's nice to have around and it's pretty decent.... Just not a 5 star rating item, in my opinion! It does make baby happy and ""Warm!"" (Even when I give her a whole body wipe down) Hehehehe."
179888,1,"This is a really good product for swaddling babies. This is for the first ""S"" in the ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" five S plan. At first it looks like a baby straightjacket but baby is content so hey, that's the main thing!"
80815,1,"I'm a fan of these pull-ups. They are super absorbent so if we're out of the house and my daughter has an accident they don't leak. They are a bit hard for her to pull up but she gets them down just fine. Unfortunately, she thinks it's fun to watch the butterflies on the front disappear, so she's less prone to make it to the potty on time. Just another fun struggle in potty training:)"
19739,0,"I like the product. However, there are 2 issues with it:(1) The 8 oz Dr. Brown bottle does not fit in the cooling compartment, making the cooling compartment not useful for me.(2) My baby takes somewhere from 3-6 oz, depending on the time of the day. In addition, sometime the bottle is at room temperature and sometime it is cool (i.e., refrigerated breast milk). It is tricky for me to heat the bottle, since I cannot just use 1 water measurement, but different ones for different amount/ temperature. The bottle temperature also depends on how long you leave the bottle in the warming compartment. I almost have to generate a table for it to cover all combinations. I have accidentally overheated the bottle several times; it took me more than a few minutes of running the bottle under cool water to reduce the temperature. If I under heat the bottle, it does not allow me to press the heat bottom right away. I have to wait for a few minutes to heat again. It can be very frustrating when the baby is already crying..."
91573,0,"My 3 month old loves this. We bought this before she was born, it is cute, easy to wash, BUT the feed do move all over the place, if you don't put the vibrate and music part in just right it does pop off, you have to put it on before the seat cover. the worst thing is I hate how when you pick up or lay baby down the crinkle of the directions on the back of the seat, it is a Kids II flaw in desingn as our rock in comcort boppy travel swing does the same thing! Over all it is good value for the money, but has some problem you should be ready for."
147860,1,"Very sturdy. I'm not using this as a hamper; it is being used in my kitchen as a trash can. I purchased the one with the white liner as it was the least expensive and I didn't plan on using the fabric liner anyway. I paid $28.00--I notice today it's down to $21.00. I am using it with a tall kitchen trash bag. I was kind of leery buying this item sight unseen, but I must say I am quite pleased with this purchase."
109989,0,"I am happy with this storage cart. It serves it's purpose as a great place to store baby clothes and blankets or diapers. It is especially handy if space is limited. It fits nicely next to the crib in our bedroom where there's no room for another dresser. It is somewhat unsteady if too much weight is placed in it. I have it set up in a place where my baby will not be able to access it once she starts crawling, but I can see the potential of it falling over if a child tried to use it for support when standing."
27671,1,"I wish I had started with this rather than a regular double stroller. It is so easy to stear and it's so light to push when running or walking. It is a little hard to fit a diaper bag in the under basket but I know that is not the intent. So I'm ok with it. My daughters love riding it! I highly reccomend a swivel wheel, it makes a world of diffrence when using the stroller in the store. and it does lock if you want it fixed in place. LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!"
61826,1,Very happy with this high chair after over 3 months of use. Lightweight.Easy to get infant in and out of it. Very easy clean up. Actually keeps my son pretty happy if you add cheerios.
68601,1,"I bought this entertainer to use in my home office to entertain my (then) baby while I got some work done. It was a fabulous investment. It saved me a bunch of money on baby sitters (the reason I used to justify the expense to my hubby when I first bought it). He would play and play and play in it. My son has been a bit small for his age. For us, this was never a problem. However, I didn't buy this for him until he was approx 6 mos old. Younger ones might find this item too overwhelming and too big to use. If you wait, though, I believe your baby will be happy with this item.One caveat, there was a problem with the item when we first bought it. (It was missing an item.) Since it was the last the store had (target) and no one else had it in stock, I called Fisher Price customer service for help. They were extremely helpful and sent me the replacement, immediately.My son is now over the age of 2 and STILL plays with it. I, now, have it in another room and am getting ready to put it in storage. Whenever he gets the chance, he runs over to it and plays for quite a while.I looked at several entertainers before purchasing this one. I, also, have another circular entertainer leftover from my first son - which I used on the first floor of my home. However, the Fisher Price Intellitainer exceeds the others in terms use and fun for my son.Oh, and it's pretty easy to take off the seat cover in order to wash it. (I've had to do that a couple times.)"
173221,0,"I just got this today, and I haven't actually used it yet. I am leaving it in my garage for a few days to let it air out. When I opened it, it was like opening a can of paint. The fumes are very strong. I do not want to put it in my car and leave the windows up. I am sure the fumes could be harmful to the baby, just as you should paint the baby's room well before it is born to protect it from those fumes. Hopefully it will air out and then I can use it.UPDATE:It did air out and I use it all the time. It does not smell at all now. I have it under the baby seat and it protects my car seat from getting dented or dimpled from the baby seat being tightly belted in over it.Only one complaint at this time. The top 3rd of the seat back falls over. It will not stand up by itself."
8292,1,This sheet feels really soft after a lot of washing and drying. I also fits my standard size crib mattress perfectly.
103267,0,"I agree in parts with many of the reviewers here. 1. The wipes are not as soft as the other brands, wish some of the other brands were available with ""subscribe and save"" too. 2. Don't want to keep throwing away plastic tubs! Though it was my fault that I didnt read the description in full. I wouldnt have purchased there had I known this before. 3. Though they appear to be thick, they did tear a few times."
42816,1,"I would recommend this product. My 3 month old did not like the Ergo carrier and loves the Moby wrap. Surprisingly, I find the Moby much more simpler to use than the Ergo. With the Moby I just wrap and tie one knot vs having to use the Ergo infant adaptor, snap all the buckles(back/sides), adjust the straps, and use the security loops, etc. Lastly the Moby breaths better, I found that we tended to overheat with the Ergo.The material is a long piece of cloth and relatively easy to wrap. I would recommend looking at YouTube to get a visual of the instructions on how to wrap it.If you're worried about wrapping this long piece of cloth in public or parking lot, I would recommend wrapping it at home, so that you'll have to insert the baby when you get your destination.I've worn the Moby when my baby is still in the stroller and have gotten comments on my stylish wrap (folks not realizing that it's a carrier). I chose the black color for it's versatility and have found that it's easy to match any outfit."
66554,0,"I've had this stroller for about 6 weeks. I have a 7 month old and a 2.5 year old. This is the first jogging stroller I've owned. I wanted a stroller primarily for walking (not running) around the neighborhood. This stroller gets the job done, but has a few cons.Cons*Doesn't latch when collapsed. I used a tip from a previous reviewer and purchased a small dog collar to keep the stroller closed when folded, but it's still a con for me.*In order to get it to fold as flat as possible, you need to remove all three wheels. Not hard to do, but when you're juggling two kids and trying to get out of the house quickly it's kind of a pain to put the wheels back on each time.*Too bulky with the wheels on for the trunk of my car (Mercury Sable). I'm fairly petite (5 feet) and can't see myself struggling with putting the wheels back on in a parking lot, while the kids wait in the car.*It's pretty heavy, which is probably a characteristic of all joggers, but between the bulk and the weight and my lack of height, I have a hard time lugging this thing around.*5-point harness is tricky to adjust. I have to re-adjust it each time in order to get the kids in and out of the straps. Also, not that big of a deal, but when you have to adjust both kids in and out it can become a hassle. I like the harness on my Graco Metrolite a lot better.Pros*Parent tray holds cell phone, keys, water bottle easily.*Sun shade is quite large. However, it won't hold it's position if you unsnap it and pull it forward more to block the sun, even after tightening the screws.*Drives smoothly.*Kids seem comfortable, even with the slight recline in the seats.*Seat cushions are easily removable and washable.All in all, this is a decent stroller. However, if you want something for quick trips to the mall, I'd go with an umbrella stroller. I'm waiting for a good deal on a Maclaren Twin Triumph."
174859,1,"My husband loves this vest, a very nice quality material but what is best is the fact that he doesn't have to carry a diaper bag when he goes out with my daughter. The 2 side pockets are perfect for bottles, sippy cups or juice boxes, we usually put a few wipes in a ziplock bag and put it in one of the chest pockets, the changing pad goes in the pocket behind the back and diapers go on both of the inside lower pockets. We usually hold on to diaper rash cream samples and stick a few in a ziplock and put it in one of the other pockets just incase we happen to need it. I had to tell him not to wear it when he was without our daughter because I was worried about it getting worn out too soon! Our toddler is 2 now and when we traveled it was perfect just being able to hand her to him to go change since he didn't have to carry anything! This was even more so on the flight too!"
126902,1,These are great diapers for keeping the baby dry and comfortable and for a great price thanks to amazon moms and subscribe and save discounts. Thanks amazon.
156842,0,"By the time your baby can sit/stand up pretty well for this toy they will already be on height 2 of this 3 choice toy. It is a great toy I'm just sad that it can't be used longer (making it have another one or two height adjustments might be nice). My other issue is the fact you cannot change the batteries in either of the two musical toys. The on/off switch in the king/queen couple is set way inside the toy and is annoying to have to keep getting a file to turn it on. So I leave it on all the time and waste the non-replaceable battery. Still, I would recommend this toy as it does give you the most bang-for-the-buck...."
88524,1,"Was away for the summer, and instead of shipping to another address, had been using another brand. When I got back home and my box of Pampers was waiting for me, I noticed the difference the first time I changed by baby. Was so happy to go back to the best brand. I have four kids under six, and have always had at least a couple kids in diapers at a time (even three at a time once!) and have been using Pampers Baby Dry for each one. Pampers have that yummy baby-fresh scent. Also the other brand that I was using (A store brand that people love and I don't know why) would immediately droop down the instant my baby made once. It made it look like her diaper was ALWAYS loaded instead of just a little wet. The Pampers are much more stable."
149959,0,This is a fab idea but it's not very sturdy. We'll keep trying but my daughter loses interest pretty quickly with this thing.
169009,2,"We have been buying pampers swaddlers and cruisers exclusively with our oldest baby and didn't hesitate to order huge packs for the newborn,,,,What a mistake, as instead of softest thick diapers that we got in size NB and 1, we've got much thinner, more rougher and SOOO much less absorbent size 1-2... we've had a new version for several days, and there hasn't been a day without leaks....oh, pampers did redesign,,,why no mention of that in the name of the diapers now? Moreover, in addition to the wasted money on these, there is no way to know what version you are buying in the store, as there is no mention on the box of ""New version"", Dry Max or whatever they are calling it now...so we are switching to huggies....very sad, but i don't feel like having leaks every day suddenly, that we've got new box of diapers..."
106533,1,Works great - no smells. LOVE that it uses regular garbage bags. Easy to change and keep clean. Great option instead of the Diaper Genie that requires special bags and is so wasteful since it wraps each diaper in plastic.
20957,1,The putty they use to capture a hand/foot print is way too sticky and pliable. It took us three times to get a decent hand print for our six month old because he kept digging into the material. Another issue after that is avoiding getting your own prints on the putty because it is just too soft. We made it work eventually and it looks nice in the frame.
34455,2,I would like this item more if I didn't live in an apartment building. I have to turn off the sound because it is all static the picture is ok but has static on it too. I can not find a monitor that is good for apartments. I hope to not live in one forever and it still helps me out a little to see the baby. In the end I am keeping the monitor but it needs some inprovements.
83873,1,"The Tiny Diner placemat is great for toddlers who aren't ready for a plate. We bought them for our 17 month old twins to eat at restaurants or the home of family or friends who do not have a high chair. Up until recently, they would grab their plate and dump the food or throw the plate to the floor. The Tiny Diner eliminates this problem as long as your child does not try to pull the suction cups from the eating surface. Our guys did that a few times, but they stopped once they got used to it. Aside from giving them a clean place to eat from, the placemat serves as a great distraction when we are waiting for our food at a restaurant and all the crayons have made their way to the floor. They clean up well and roll up very easily for storage. They are also affordable. If your child isn't ready for a plate and you don't like them eating from a table top, this is the solution you've been looking for. p.s. Kiddopotamus needs to come out with other colors. The pink and blue are too gender traditional for parents who prefer more gender neutral colors."
35426,1,Great idea to make mom and others laugh and a plus for the baby. Why? Because he will recieve more attention of course!
9964,1,"We got this for our 2.5 yr old who is potty training. I was concerned that it wouldn't sit well in the toilet seat, but it does. It secures tightly and is a perfect fit for her little behind. ;-)"
18404,2,"My baby was having terrible gas problems so I after trying Avent and Playtex, I decided to give Dr. Browns a try. I saw no improvement in the gas problems my baby had, in fact, I can't stand these bottles now!!! They are the BIGGEST hassle to travel with (you can't clean them well without extra cleaning devices), the leak like crazy, and they are basically confusing for babysitters/family members who watch the baby. Unfortunately, I bought 12 of them and I regret it terribly - they are a waste of money and time (they take much longer to clean). I've read the other reviews and it's strange that there are so many positive reviews because I personally know at least 8-10 other mothers who also cannot stand them for the same reasons I mentioned. Another problem is that the replacement pieces come in 3 packs but one generally doesn't misplace 3 of an item?!! Take a pass and save your money!!! Stick with Avent!!"
116283,0,"The product's idea is great, but unfortunately if you put too much strenght in opening the sliding door, that will definitely make the tape ""disconnect"" from the glass.My son (2yo) hasn't figure it out yet, but I did...Again, great idea, but the tape strenght has to be improved"
121077,0,I bought these for my 4 year old who occassionally wets the bed at night. They are great for this light-duty purpose. My dauther loves the fun designs and they are easy for her to put on/off like panties or she can pretend to be a baby and mom can put it on like a diaper.I used cloth diapers from the time she was born. I wouldn't recommend these for infants or toddlers who are not yet potty trained. They are not very absorbant (but work well enough to contain any night-time messes)and they are very bulky to wash and take a long time to dry. For those just starting out with cloth diapers I would recommend gDiapers.
165035,1,"We are on our 2 second child and still use the Pampers Dry brand. With my 1st daughter we tried some less expensive brands like Huggies and they all leaked. Pampers NEVER LEAKED....My new little one is 4 months and sleeps all night long. When she gets up in morning, the pamper is so full to the max but the sheets and her clothing are all very dry!!!! I keep reading about this pamper leaking...all I can say is that maybe the pamper is put on loosely. I have a friend who just barely tapes them on and complaints that they leak............that is because they are hanging more off than on. TRUST PAMPERS!!!"
174368,0,"I bough my new car knowing that I would need a fix for a seat belt that digs into my neck. It is a sporty car and I am a short girl. After a little research I purchased this and Allison Corporation 54-1214 Memory Foam Seat Belt Comforter about 6 months ago.I have stopped using the Strap Adjuster because it added an extra step to buckling in that was ok for the first 2 months, but quickly got old and I just didn't feel like dealing with it. Plus, even with the Strap Adjusted I needed to use the foam cover.I don't really love the Memory Foam Seat Belt Comforter but I guess at least I'm still using it."
152453,1,"It took my husband and I a good hour and a half to get the bed assembled. Some of the holes that were supposed to be pre-drilled were not, so we had to drill the holes in ourselves. But, once we finally got it put together, our 20 month old son absolutely loved it. He climbed in the first night and looked at Goodnight Moon until he fell asleep and then slept all night long. He also likes to play in the bed during the day. Even though it was a major pain to put together, it was worth it."
112982,2,You request an e-mail from us to give you a preference of color. Why bother? I requested pink or green (for a baby girl) and was sent a blue.
100760,2,"This are horrible for newborns. We had one on and not only did it leak through the diaper, but her clothes, blanket, and on to what she was sitting on. So gross. I won't buy these again. This is what I would expect from a cheap knockoff brand not a name brand. Don't make the mistake of buying this for a newborn.They also don't have the indicator strip, so you have to open to see which is frustrating for a newborn. Pay a little more for swaddlers or huggies because they are a waste of money. I'm donating them to a shelter or something because we can't use these."
86953,1,The bottles are easy to hold and have cute designs on them. The liners are easy to drop in and fill. The nipples simulate a natural nipple. I believe these nursers are a good way to transition the baby from breast feeding to using a bottle.
115841,1,It's light and handy. My baby girl used to ride big Graco stroller but now she likes this small anc confortable Chicco Stroller. I couldn't find any problems for more than 1 month.Thanks
111262,1,"I have two types of BF-ing tents, but I almost only use this one because the fabric is wider and less heavy.Amongst my new mother friends, this is the only hootie hider (as one calls it) that they use.All told, it covers as needed, folds down nicely, and allows for easy baby viewing.With any BF-tent one should be aware of the following:~active, grabby baby (or as one lady calls it ""Two cats fighting under a blanket"")~it doesn't cover your back, so if you're out, always wear a loose fitting, front opening top/sweater of some sort so you're not all exposed on one side~THE WIND!I also like the fact that when I'm at some one else's house and baby falls asleep, he can have some dimmer lighting (less stim) under the tent. I can either keep him on his side or shift him up to my chest too.All told, a nice item to have and one that ladies I know who DIDN'T buy one wish they did."
73851,2,"After reading reviews and getting an idea of what this thing does, I decided this would have to be my first baby gadget. I loved the idea behind it and everybody that used it loved it to. I purchased mine from babies-r-us. When i got it home and started to play with it the display went out before I could even get the time set. As you can imagine I was very disappointed. I returned the bad one and exchanged it for a new one. This time it was bad as soon as I turned it on. Most of the display worked on this one but about 10% of the characters would not show up. I even tried changing batteries several times in hopes that that would fix the problem. unfortunately it did not. The display seems to be a major problem. This time I just got my money back. So if you do decide to buy this thing I hope you have better luck than I do."
66784,0,"it does fit the double jogger stroller we got but its a little flimsy, and i would of prefferred the drink holders to be a little wider... we had to really push our cups down in there... also would of liked more space for extas... its definately better than not having a parent tray but not as high quality as i thought it would of been for bring the fancier brand and all so disappointed..."
60838,1,"I previously reviewed this item and had decided that although it *is* better than stinking up the kitchen trash with dirty diapers, it's not better by much. But then Playtex came out with the ""toddler diaper"" refills, they are supposed to contain odors better. Well guess what-they actually do! We've gone from barely using our genie to using it all the time. We keep it in the baby's closet, because at least only the closet would stink. But now, the closet doesn't even smell. I'm amazed that these refills could make such a big difference, but they really do. The only downside is that they are more expensive than the regular refills, hopefully that will change. But I think I can now say that the genie was worth the money I spent on it. A lot of people told me that i didn't need a diaper pail but let me tell you, after 18 months of diapering, I have found that you definitely do unless you want to be taking the trash out on a daily basis. We only put stinky diapers in the genie, we throw the wet-only ones in the regular trash. That way we don't have to go through as many refills as we normally would. I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend the genie to anyone."
91481,1,"Pretty good monitor. I like having 2 receivers. I also really like the lights!! The quality of the reception does seem to depend on your location (or the location of the monitor). If I move the monitor around in my baby's room I will get different quality of reception on the receiver. Just play around with it a little. We ended up putting it on the floor (on the carpet). What ever works right? There is still a little static sometimes, but I don't know if that can be helped. I can hear my baby very clearly with this monitor set."
4826,1,"I love these diapers. I wish I was able to use cloth, but it's just not going to happen. I feel very good about using these diapers because they are free of toxic chlorine. My son is six months old and has been using Seventh Generation diapers since he was about a week old. We had some Huggies and Pampers that were given to us as gifts, but they didn't hold the mess as well. I also appreciate that the Seventh Generation diapers don't have any cutesy cartoons on them and absolutley love that they aren't filled with perfumes. The Subscribe and Save feature is terrific. The diapers are quite a bit cheaper and who can beat free delivery, especially since they are hard to find in my area. This is a great product and a great service."
45465,1,"My four month old baby has been enjoying his play mat since he was three weeks old. I thought that as he grew he'd lose interest, but every time he reaches a new milestone he finds a different way to play on it. At first all he liked was the mirror, then he preferred staring the toys, then reaching for them. Now he rolls and kicks the bars and watches how everything wiggles. It's amazing to see how long it can keep him entertained. The music goes on for ten minutes at a time - and the Mozart is far more pleasing to the ear than the nursery rhymes. A great gift!"
184267,1,"This is a great product. When my son was born he slept in the bed next to me in this. I loved it because I felt better knowing he was right there next to me. I could check on him in the middle of the night (10xs a night if I wanted to) without have to get up out of bed. I didn't worry about rolling over him either because of the hard top and sides on this sleeper. My only complaint would be that my son out grow this fairly quickly. It was just too short; I wished that they designed this to fit longer babies, and for that I took off 1 star. Other than that I would recommend this product."
60070,1,"this is our thrid tub and by far the best. my son loves it, he can splash around as much as he wants and i think it is more safe than the others we had. if you have a long baby this tub is great because of its size, my sons feet started to hang over our first tub at 3 months. i would recomend that you fill the tub where you are going to use it because it is heavy when filled."
127487,1,"We got this for our twin boys and they have enjoyed it much. They play in it, chew it and love it. We love it too....the set up is easy and it is very sturdy. I am going to buy another one now that they need their separate cribs."
158995,0,but it's not strong enough to hold new born baby's hed.I have 2 month old baby but I can't use this product yet.it maybe good for little older or hevy babys to carry.
153503,1,"Thanks to these little thing (ok and help from an episode of Blue's Clues) my child didn't just know the primary colors but he knew what yellow and blue, red and blue, and so on made when they were mixed. He had a real life understanding because he did it hands on. He loves the blue tablets because it looks like "" a swimming pool"". Lots of fun."
57545,2,"The mesh cover arrived with a snap missing. Very disappointing. The most annoying thing is the seller, Baby Bungalow, would not exchange it and just gave me the customer service number for Phil & Teds. Why couldn't they just exchange it for new one, as if I had bought it in their store. Not cool. Will never buy from them again!!!!!!"
183569,1,"I have had this exact high chair (Graco Harmony - Colby pattern) for 2 years, and I love it! I fully intend to purchase another one with the same features so I'll have 2 to use with my twins.This is the third type of highchair we've had. The first was an evenflo and a pain to clean - we used it for a year. The second was a PegPerego bought on clearance, but when I put my then 1-year-old in it, it sat so low the tray was even with her eyes! I sold that at a garage sale.When purchasing this GRACO highchair 2 years ago, I TOOK my daughter and PUT her in the chair to make sure it would fit her. We've used it with the tray, and also without the tray at the table. It does fit farther under the table if you remove the front restraining bar. This also enables her to climb up by herself.Features I LOVE: clean-up - the cover just wipes clean, and I've machine washed and dried it several times; the baby booster seat - helps get small babies up higher in the seat; 5-point harness - great for wigglers; storage basket - good for keeping bibs, etc.Overall, I really like the features of this highchair. Since my daughter is now old enough to use a booster seat, I plan to purchase another Harmony high chair so I'll have 2 for my twins!"
136610,2,"I ordered this thinking it was the one I got for our other car which was from Sunshine Kids. The products look almost identical, but the sunshine kids is longer and covers more seat area for the big car seats. Also, the material is thicker and quality of protection is superior. Wish I hadn't tossed the box for this one or I would return it. The Kiddopotamus is OK, but in comparison it is just not as good."
74757,1,If you have a baby that is fussy and wants the confinement of a tight blanket this is the one. Very pretty and warm.
139819,2,"I purchased this walker for my five month old daughter. She had already been happy with her saucer, but I thought that she might enjoy being more mobile and less confined. First, the walker was difficult to put together and then when I tried taking it apart, it wouldn't disassemble. The toys are loud and startled my daughter. She grew disinterested in a very short time. The walker is bulky and doesn't roll well. I would pass on buying this."
81405,1,"Bought this to go along with carseat from graco- works great for infant. put kiddo in carseat, then carseat latches seamlessly into the stroller- it's awesome. I also like how it folds down to about 25% of its size so it fits nicely in the trunk of my car."
132866,1,"I love mine, it not only is more attractive it REALLY holds its smells and is SO EASY to use with one hand on my baby and one hand to dispose of the diaper! The refills may be a little more but they last forever and you determine how big or small the bag should be before disposing. I think this is the BEST! In fact, when I was picking up refills the other day the woman shopper next to me said she threw her Genie out and got the Dekor! She agreed that this was the better system!"
85367,0,"I bought this product because a lot of people had success with it. I am 5'4 and feel overwhelmed by all the pillow. I have used it 4 times and it now is now off the bed. It felt like I could never get a handle on how to lay in it. I think it would be better suited for a taller person without short legs. It is still good quality, however, and if you are willing to spend the money give it a try."
62811,2,"When having our first child I had the impression that this was a MUST have item for the nursery. I would have to say I gave in and bought it and wish I would have spent my money on another item that was needed. I ended up using grocery bags that were in our home already instead of buying expensive refill. Another complaint is that when you start the ""string of sausage"" it is rather difficult and doesn't always start off well. I would just suggest putting your money on a better item."
155498,1,"I am so glad I got this sheet, it is so soft I want a big one for my bed. It is true to color and seems like it will breath well for summer but stay warm for winter."
43760,1,This was a much needed piece to the gate that i purchased. With this piece it makes the gate fit perfectly where i wanted it which is at the top of my stairs. Also made the gate extra sturdy.
3950,1,"If someone told me I would spend $500+ on a stroller I would say never. But after a visit to Land of Nod, read lots of review online my husband and I decided to splurge on the Quinny Buzz Stroller for our first and only child. It was the trip to Land of Nod that triggered me to consider this stroller. If you live in a walking city, like Chicago, it is one of the best strollers; it is excellent on the sidewalks, great for jogging, light weight, handling with one hand. The stroller comes with ALL the accessories, unlike most strollers. Our daughter enjoys the comfort of the Quinny Buzz; it is her little hybrid car. If you live in a city where you do lots of walking or strolling I would highly recommend this stroller. Also, it is good through toddler; so it is ONE stroller for ALL age."
43378,1,I purchased this for my first grandchild. He seems to love it - he is always sleeping in it! It manuvers very easily and is quite sturdy. Very comfortable to push. Would purchase it again.
171379,1,"Absolutely great buy, it fits on the kitchen's double sink and is great. My baby is 4 months old and I have been using it since he was 2 weeks old. I can't wait to give it as a present to my expecting friends."
158341,0,"Great for potty training, however the size is irregular. I am sure my child will grow with them in the future."
23096,0,"There's not much to review here - if you have a Medela pump, you are pretty much stuck buying something like this. I find that paying about a dollar per membrane seems a bit much, but it's not like you have much choice."
130746,1,"I originaly bought this three years ago for my first baby girl and now I am using it for my second baby girl and it's just great. She loves it as much as her sister did three years ago.I even have a couple of friends that come over with their babies and they are amazed at how fast asleep and how relaxed their babie's are when they put them in the swing. I have reccommend this to every future parent I've known. I can't imagine what I was going to miss out if I wouldn't have bought it.My baby literally stays there for over an hour and I'm sure she would stay longer except that i take her out because she can't be in it the whole day, But that hour sure helps me get other things done around the house. With my first daughter I thought that I was just lucky that she enjoyed it but now with my second is the same thing, she enjoys it as much as the first. And even though It's 3 years old it looks brand new and works as if i bought yesterday. Bottom line is that you can't go wrong with this model."
170096,1,"I bought this crib in cherry for 245$, after reading every review about this and many other cribs and safety reports.My babygril is now 4 months old. she sleeps well in it. She slept in it sinds day one.It's beautiful, very sturdy, came in perfect state..but now it has a few scrates(mostely form a belt).It's easy to setup if you just follow the instructions, my boyfriend did it on his own in about 1 hour, I sat and watched...was 37 weeks pregnant. the cherry collor is just as you see it in the picture.I still have it on the highest mattress level, because my girl cannot situp on her own yet... but sometimes I wished it had a dropside because it gets harder lifting her out of her crib all the time, she's 7 kg now.. but then a dropside is dangerous. it weigh alot, but still is very easy to move arround when you need to clean.so if you like the looks... buy it..it's worth it. good furniture.my girl is now 21 months, still sleeps very well in her crib.I still am very happy with my purches. A great crib."
40038,2,I have three of these for my three kids' rooms. After a while they begin to whine when on the wind setting which is the only one which has steady sound. Also the volume doesn't go high enough. I'm buying three new ones and throwing these away.
115802,0,"Neither my husband or I could go more than a few steps without kicking the wheels (he's 6'4"" and I'm 5'2""). Its definitely on its way back to the store."
94163,0,This jumper is great for my 5 month old as it has good support and a tray for leaning on (maybe eventually she will want toys on it). My only criticism is that is difficult to adjust the height and she is already at the shortest length (ie to make the cord short enough that there is not too much weight on her legs). At just 5 months I am concerned that she will not get much use out of it as she grows taller.
82601,1,"We just received the sleep sheep yesterday, and not coincidentally our five-week old slept in her crib for the first time with the sleep sheep hanging on the side nearby. Just this morning she got a bit fussy, and the sleep sheep calmed her down in about a minute and a half. I like the timed feature--45 minutes seems just enough to do the trick. The sheep is made out of very soft material too and is super cute. I agree that the on-the-go version is jus the right size. Like many of the reviewers, we practice the 5 Ss of _Happiest Baby on the Block_. The shushing gets a bit tiring, but the sound of the sleep sheep serves the purpose, and more effectively. It even serves as a little pillow for her head when we've swaddled her and are jiggling her. This is a terrific product that will be indispensable for us. Right up there with the miracle blanket!"
149179,1,"I bought this pillow when I was 25 weeks pregnant. Before I had the pillow, I was shifting positions about once an hour and waking up to use the bathroom 2-3 times per night. Since I got the pillow, I shift positions a couple of times a night and usually only go to the bathroom once per night. I sleep much deeper and feel a lot more rested in the morning, which has been a godsend! My husband does have a bit less room than he used to in our queen sized bed, but since he's a total bed hog, I don't feel bad for him! His sleep has not been disturbed at all - he only finds the pillow cumbersome when we're watching tv or reading in bed. Once he lays down and gets comfortable, he's fine. A few reviews mentioned that the cover is a little scratchy and they used a second pillow case for their head, but I don't find it to be scratchy at all. It feels perfect to me!"
113928,1,"I've been using this seat for more than one month now. It's a great product. But since it has a hard seat surface, I don't feel like putting the baby sitting there for long, his butt turns red if sit for more than 20 minutes. I hope they can come with a seating pad. Also, the tray can be deeper. When I give baby the cheerios, they fell off the tray so easily."
135931,1,"My son wound up in the hospital at 6 weeks with severe high volume reflux. The gastroenterologist recommended Dr Browns bottles with an X cut nipple ( we needed to add cereal to his formula to weigh it down so it would stay in his stomach ). Prior to switching bottles he would gulp so much air there was little room in his stomach for food and it would come right up, he would also squirm in pain from the air bubbles in his belly. When we switched to Dr Browns I saw immediate results (even before the we started his reflux meds), there is still some spit up but the gas pains are GONE. I wouldn't even try to switch to another brand. As far as cleaning, the very little extra time it may take is so worth the comfort my son has received from using these bottles. But really it takes very little extra time. I put all the pieces in a basket on the top shelf of the dishwasher(I don't even need the little brush they include...) and they go through the dry cycle to sterilze just fine. And the leaking some people have experienced I believe is from overtightening the cuff which is easy to do and will produce immediate leaking but is easy to fix. Don't forget to keep the vent clear for best results. One last note, I prefer the wide mouth bottle, it's great for mixing powder formula or adding cereal..."
66938,0,"Overall the gate is well designed and functional, but it really irks me that they cannot seem to send long enough screws to mount this thing. It wouldn't be that hard to do.I like complete packages, and wouldn't feel good giving 4-5 stars until they correct this issue. Most folks, I imagine, will want to mount through drywall or plaster into a stud. Further, I think most would want the security that comes with a longer mounting screw."
118965,2,Love the color but not sure what they look like assembled. Ordered two and neither one came with bolts or size needed to purchase!
43396,1,"This is an absolutely MUST HAVE!Easy, convinient, useful. Great for small grocery shopping and for shopping itself. Can handle a lot of heavy stuff in the basket- christmas proofed! Absolutely love 2 cupholders and a little box on top where you can put keys and cell phone and close it. I`m so happy that I bought it for my chicco carseat, I would recommend it to everybody.Totaly worth the money. AMMMAAAZIING!!!!!!"
178197,1,"Very happy with the product. Out of several boxes, I think only one bag leaked. Had no problems with these at all."
57975,1,"Very convenient product - especially during the nights since you don't want to go through the hassle of warming up the contents under hot tap water. Also, the auto shut off feature is best I liked since I tend to forget things when I am half asleep. :-)Good buy - whether it is a gift or a buy - worth it!"
137187,1,"The couple seemed very happy to get this as it was on their registry at a baby store and 'sold out'. Tracked it down on Amazon. Seems pricy to me, that's what makes it a great gift. New parents may hesitate to spend the money but will appreciate the style and function."
91935,0,"I got this when I was about 6.5 months pregnant after my husband said the my back was sore in the morning was that my belly was pulling it out of alignment. At first I was a bit confused as to how this pillow would help, but I managed to stuff a bit of it under my belly and it seemed to do the trick.However, there is a lot of excess pillow not being used for support, and it takes up bed space. I'm now eight months pregnant and find that I don't need it as much as my belly is big enough to touch the bed itself when I'm lying on my side and therefore not pulling on my back. I find the stuffing to be quite loose (as in the pillow case should be sewn smaller) and it does shift and pack down - especially on the leg portion. (I am 5'2"" and about 150 at this point, so I imagine it would be worse for a larger person.)If I was doing it over again, I think I'd try the wedge instead."
47884,1,"We bought this gate after having a pressure mounted gate, that you have to step over. It is currently between the dining room and kitchen doorways. The first gate we had you had to step over, a close friend tried to step over it, and fell and almost smashed her face on our oven! That night her and I went to Babies R Us, and found this gate. We had a blast putting it up, trying to create our own directions, but once it was up, it was great! It has been properly functioning, my handle has NEVER broken, it's never fallen, or closed improperly. We are about to purchase a new home with steep stairs, we are going to buy two more of these gates today!! I've had this gate for 2 years now, my only problem was the finger prints and smudgy face prints from my son, and the best way I have found to keep it looking brand new (STILL)is to use Windex Multi Surface (the green one) it keeps the plexi-glass clean, and keeps the gate clean too! I would hands down recommend this gate to anyone and everyone I come into contact with! We even have baseboards, and I like the fact that the gate goes over them, and that makes it that much more difficult for my son to attempt to stand or swing on it (which has never happened no matter how hard he's tried!)I love this gate!!! I love it!"
138082,1,"My children ages 4 and 6 love the turtle and it is used every night. The only thing I wish is that it had some soothing music with it. I would highly recommend this light, it is bright enough to see the stars on the ceiling but not too bright as to distract the kids from rest."
119685,2,"I registered for this monitor for my shower and was so excited to get it. My daughter (four months old) absolutely loves to watch the lights. I don't use the music, I play a classical music cd instead. However, the monitor part of it is HORRIBLE!! Our bedroom is only three feet from my daughter's and I cannot hear through the monitor. There is a constant clicking sound and a high-pitched buzzing. When my daughter does make a noise, I can't even hear it through the monitor because of the loud clicking. We haven't used this since we received it (as a montior), just as a light show. I would definitely recommend buying a different monitor and then buy one of those new &amp;quot;light show&amp;quot; toys that are available from many different companies."
2528,1,"Absorbent diapers, but not bulky at all. How does Pampers do it?! I've been using them since my little cub was born and I'll never use any other diaper. Thanks, Pampers, from a busy new mommy!"
127592,1,Works perfect but not sturdy to use for big babies and babies who start to roll over. So the use is limited to only 3 months.
155126,1,So far very happy with the camera monitor....way worth the money. My toddler just starting sleeping in a big girl bed and it's nice to be able to see if she gets out. I will be using the extra camera in the new babies room. Very clear picture. The sound has some static in it but not enough for it to be a problem : )
25147,0,"Fits okay, but the bottom front where the elastic draw string goes around the front of the stroller comes loose too easily. Use of the shade is hampered by that loose fit, especially when baby wants to walk, or get down and the stroller motor is messing with getting the sun shade to stay in place. I probably would not buy this accessory again but will keep it and use it."
28335,2,My husband and I ordered this chair to rock our newborn son in. We have had it a week and already had three springs break and a button pop off. My husband almost took a hammer and destroyed the chair after the last spring popped and almost broke his finger. Neither me or my husband are over 115-120 pounds so weight was not an issue. I am very upset with our purchase and feel that our son's safety was in danger. I am returning the chair and would not recommend this product to anyone!
153785,1,"This is a great gate. It is easy to use. Pressure mounted. And folds easily and compactly for storage or travel ( this gate comes with its own travel case)I liked the idea of a ""soft gate"" so that little heads and bodies dont get hurt should they try to stand or fall against it.It is sturdy and easy to open and replace. It expands to a generous size - or if you live in an older house like I do, it fits small doorways perfectly.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. It is rather expensive compared to other gates."
107856,0,"This is a nice pump if you are staying at home and plan to use it between normal feedings to relieve full breasts. However...if you plan to pump after you return to work you absolutely have to get a double electric pump. I used this pump when my milk first came in and after pumping for 20 minutes (switching hands because my wrists were getting sore...and then having my husband pump for a while) I had only expressed maybe a 1/2 ounce of milk and my breasts were still overflowing. I will say, though, it wasn't painful to use for my breast, only for my wrists. Not good for anyone who works at computers who may already have carpul tunnel from repetetive motions."
97630,0,This toddler toiler seat is perfect for a girl but for a boy it has it's challenges. When he sits down to urinate it goes every where except in the toilet. He prefers to stand but that is hard also because the seat is not made for standing only sitting. This potty toiler is not made for a boy in training.
72585,2,"How is it possible that this sippy cup leaks so badly, while at the same time is too difficult for my 1-YO to suck liquid out of? I'm sick of her frustration at not being able to drink her milk out of this thing, and sick of getting sticky drips all over the place! It's just as bad with or without the handles under the lid. I even tried making the nipple hole larger, and poking a second hole for air release. No difference. I just threw it into the trash, because that's what it is."
132125,1,I really loved this diaper change kit especially because it has little padding for the baby's head while changing. the compartments are very spacious.
80774,0,"These are good for toddlers that are a little farther along in the potty training experience. I had bought these for my daughter when we decided to start potty training her because we figured they would be a lot easier to take off and put on than a regular diaper, which they are. The only problem was, when she peed in the diaper, it would sag and fall down. There were several times that we would be at the store and her diaper and pants would fall down because she went in her diaper and not the potty."
133618,1,"As a first-time mom, I haven't done any potty training before. This seat is very soft, doesn't move, and is easy to clean. The ""deflector"" part in the front is a little stumpy. He easily pees over it. I'm very pleased with this product overall."
135426,1,"This monitor does the job of a simple audio monitor. In today's world with all the fancy, high-priced video monitors out there this one is a good basic audio monitor. My only complaint is the battery life...tends to go through a set of batteries pretty quickly. We usually just use the adapter to plug ours in the wall and save the battery life for when we really need it (out in the yard, etc.). I would recommend investing in some rechargeable batteries for this monitor...otherwise you'd spend a small fortune buying replacement batteries. Good solid product overall."
102124,0,"My special needs 10 yr old wears these both day and night. He is still learning to use the bathroom, but likes the idea of not having to wear a diaper. Although the fit is great and they work really for him during the day and for short naps, I find that I have to use a pad similar to a sanitary napkin across the sides at night because he is a side sleeper and there is no absorbancy in the sides of these at all."
156341,1,Perfect for those cold winter nights. My son loves that he can poke his feet out and stand. Sizing is bigger than you would expect but fine b/c it gives a little room to grow in.
154392,1,Very happy with these wipes from Seventh Generation. My son has sensitive skin and it has been all we can do to get rid of a daily diaper rash that changed every diaper! We switched to these wipes and Seventh Generation diapers and the rash is gone! I like that the wipes are not excessively wet or leaving a residue on his skin. He appears clean and happy after all changes and wipe usage. Thanks Seventh Generation - And thank you Amazon for carrying these diapers! Such a relief to find something that works so well after trying numerous other brands of wipes and diapers.
25092,1,"I used this gate at a family member's house, and I loved it, so I bought one for our place. However, it is too small for our normal, standard width hallway. I have to buy the extension for it. It's a great gate, but I think it should be a little wider. I was REALLY looking forward to putting it up and containing my crazy toddler, but now I have to wait on the mail man to bring the extension kit."
135345,1,"This goes great with my boys nursery, very pleased. Exactly as pictured and holds lots of diapers! Just love the blue and brown together."
43683,1,"I LOVE this bath seat. Here's why...1. My son is 14 months old and we are STILL using it. At first we used in the kitchen sink and now we use in the bathtub.2. Been used 300+ times and still in perfect condition.3. Not bulky like the tubs. Seats are much easier to use.4. Dries quickly.5. Folds up very small - easy to store and ideal for travel.6. Great price!The only drawback to this seat is that it doesn't work well in a small kitchen sink. (Our sink is approximately 18"" X 12"" and it's a perfect fit - I wouldn't recommend using it in a sink smaller than that size.)Overall, this bath seat is great and well worth the price."
46563,1,"I originally purchased this item for use on my daughter's crib that converts to a daybed. I didn't realize that it would cover the entire length of the bed which meant she couldn't get in and out on her own. We are now using it on a twin bed and it works well. My only complaint is that when it is folded down, it doesn't fold flat against the bed. Maybe it does in a mattress that isn't inset in the frame."
143806,1,"This is the best pet gate made. It is functional, well made, attractive and priced right. The gate is very sturdy. I am so glad that I ordered it. You will not be disappointed."
31902,0,This is a great starter pack becuase it comes with a sample of what you will need to begin pumping. However I felt that the 2.7 ounce sizes are too small as my baby was eating 4 ounces when I went back to work. So one of these containers was too small for the amount I was pumping.
166521,1,Who ever thought of this is a genius. I never run out of diapers anymore. They are delivered to my doorstep once a month for a very low price. The shipping is free. It's so much cheaper than buying diapers at the store. The quality is wonderful. We have been doing this for 3 months now and we havent had any leaks. My neice told me about this and I tell everyone I know that is having or has a baby. Amazon is wonderful. Now I checkout amazon whenever I need anything.
151699,0,"I think you could just use bio oil, but I read that it wasn't good for pregnant women to use because of some ingredient that gets absorbed. So, it was suggested that this is used. The truth about stretch marks is that you are going to get them or not by your genes. So if you mama had them, you very well may not be able to prevent them. My doctor told me this as well. The best thing to do is keep your skin hydrated. Cocoa butter is wonderful for this. This oil is okay. I don't believe that it is going to make that much of a difference. I don't have to worry about stretch marks anyway, I just get an itchy stomach, but I would use bio oil truthfully if I did get them. I have gone to their website and there doesn't seem to be anything harmful in it. It is actually recommended for pregnant women to use. Especially after labor and your stomach shrinks. Some people posted amazing results that diminished their stretch marks. I only wish they created a product that was cheap to prevent varicose and spider veins and broken capillaries."
124378,1,"Every time I would turn my back my two-year-old twins would get into the toilet. It was disgusting, messy and made my life a complete hassle. I would have to stop cooking dinner, clean up the mess, bathe the kids and hope they'd stay out of the bathroom. There is no way to lock the door to our guest bathroom, and I was actually going to have to run out and purchase yet another child gate to keep the kids out of there.I figured the price of this lock is cheaper than a new gate, so I bought one to see if it would work.It works! It took all four spacers to make the lock fit our somewhat oddly shaped German toilet, but now that it's in the kids can't budge it a bit. The toilet is a large oval, so I had to put the lock directly in the front to keep the lid down tightly.It's been a while now and they can't get around it, even if they pull on the lock or try to force the toilet lid up. It's gotten to the point where they don't even bother with the toilet anymore.I'm buying another for our entry way 1/2 bath so I don't have to keep locking the door from the outside. I wish I'd known months ago that I could spend less than $8 for a solution to this problem!"
181230,1,"Okay, my husband and I both really love this for our son. He's just about 2 months old, and enjoys this in the daytime. He only has so long that he'll lay in it and listen to the songs and deal with the stimulation of color and different stuff going on, but we really think that as he gets older, he'll be using it more and more. We also use it for good tummy time. Have not washed it yet, but puting it together was Very easy. I do wish that the music lasted longer. LOVE the leaf on the floor. The giraffe cover is really smart. The toys, LOVE THEM. The colors on top that flash, LOVE THEM. I really do recommend this to any parent for lots of baby stimulation; learning."
51790,1,"I really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good. the only thing i don&acute;t like is the way the strings work. there are not enough and also they rip off easily. not stitched well for the price.Generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed, also suffication could be a problem.We have bought a convertable crib (common in Europe) which can be used till approx. age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later.anyhow we still love it. it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari."
114946,1,"This seat is just perfect. It sits very securely on pretty much any kitchen chair. It has both back *and* under-side straps. It has an inset tray that you can remove (which fits easily in the dishwasher) and still has the main tray underneat. It's easy to clean. The height is easily adjustable. My 22 month old has used this for about 4 months now, and loves it. I feel safe with her in it (the straps are very secure and not uncomfortable).I have recommended it to many other parents, most of whom have also bought it & loved it."
25358,1,"great product. very easy to install. our cabinets are old and warped, so we needed to use the screws to firm up the cabinet part, but not the door part, which was perfect. we did all the bottom cabinets in our kitchen and bathroom in no time flat and its already holding up very well to our son's prying fingers and yanking hands."
158268,1,"I bought these toppers thinking, ""Wow, they stick to the potty!"" and when I got them I was a little disappointed to see there were only 2 strips of tape on the bottom, but the first time I used one, I quickly realized that, although there are only 2 strips, THEY HOLD! I practically had to rip the topper apart to get it off the seat, and my son absolutely loved it! I folded one and tucked it in the back of my wallet, so that I always have one handy while we're out and about. I have highly recommended these to my friends and family, and will continue to use them."
35170,2,"I'd say people are very delirious and following media hype of this product with their reviews. The product, when sat in its tube. In a room temperature environment (as it is supposed to do) separates itself into one part sticky clear oil, and another part the white/tan paste. The two ingredients do not work together as a whole entity and makes a mess on your hands and on the baby. I have yet to see it work for a diaper rash, mild or moderate... and it smells to high heaven. I prefer good old fasioned, orange A&D Ointment.... Clears diaper rash up in an hour for good."
150456,2,The wash cloths are very thin. If I would have realized they were so thin I would have passed on them.
108078,1,"I love this pump. My sister recomended a more expensive one, but I read so many good reviews of this one, and since I only need to pump a few times a week at most, I bought this one. The only difficulty I've had is putting it back togeather after washing it. It goes together well enough, but it doesn't seem to work strait off. I always have to re-tighten or loosen a part to make it work again. Otherwise, for the price its wonderful. Very quiet and efficient."
86926,2,"On the 2nd day of use while trying to squeeze the excess air out of the drop in bag the bag edge pulled free of the bottle spilling 3.5oz of precious pimped breast milk all over me, the baby, the pillow she was on, the bed, bed skirt, the nightstand and the floor! This is an incredibly flawed system. If you try to squeeze the excess air out of the drop in bag your chance of either pulling the bag free or putting a whole in it is large. Plus the hole at the bottom to teach said bag is way to small for the average adult hand and has a sharp bottom edge to boot. Finally as the baby finishes the bottle the bag collapses into the nipple making it nearly impossible for her to truly finish whatever milk is at the bottom. And! If she breaks suction air gets in anyway! Steer clear of the for your own sanity."
155488,0,This sheet has been durable and is true to the color in the image when I received it. The sheet faded slightly after the first wash which I guess is to be expected with a jersey sheet. It's very soft and seems comfortable for babies.
55038,0,"This seat is cute and makes for a fun incentive. However, it is much harder than the Bjorn seat to fit to your toilet seat. I almost cracked the entire seat trying to put in the safety pegs, before I ever used it. It still didn't fit my seat. I just use it without them. The feet on the duck are made of sticky rubber that helps keep it in place. I think the Baby Bjorn seat is better with the dial adjuster, it's just not as cute. I use the duck for the downstairs toilet."
133647,1,"Very comfortable, and handy, I liked that came with a hook to hang on the wall, so the potty seat, doesn't sit on the floor when it's not being used. Great price compared to other seats."
183301,1,"I love this bassinet. I put a lot of thought into what I would buy for my second baby. This bed has been great. The changing table has really come in handy. If you write to the company, you can get another ""sheet"" for $5. They were fast."
159444,0,"WARNING/UPDATE: We're on replacement screen #2 and it has warped sound and an electrical short that drains the batteries in 20 minutes. Add to this the problem mentioned by others that, even when securely strapped in, the kid managed to lean himself sideways and hang off the edge, THIS PRODCT IS LANDFILL. Replacement screen #3 arrived today and is headed right for the trash with the base product. FAULTY & UNSAFE PRODUCT.________________I received this bouncer as a gift a month before my son was born. I began setting it up a week before he arrived only to find out that a metal cross-rod was missing. Fisher Price required me to mail parts of the bouncer to them at my expense (with insurance, the cost was over $10.00) to facilitate an exchange, as they do not provide the part, but replace the entire bouncer as a whole. Lots of waste here!My son has been using the bouncer now for about two and a half weeks, and the bubble screen has just died. The light and music work, but no bubbles, no twirling starfish and no kissing fish. I've written to FP with this second problem, and as yet (48-hours) have received no reply.I've enjoyed the working product: it's given me time to shower while the kid is in his morning rest mode, and keeps him entertained beside me while I'm a-pumping away breastwise. Unfortunately, between missing and disfunctional parts, I'm annoyed.Check the box for parts before buying, and be prepared for breakdowns. I'll update my review when I hear from FP regarding the bubble screen._______________________________________"
4961,1,"I hesistated to buy these diapers, because I expected them to work less well than conventional diapers as a trade-off for buying ""green"". Boy, was I wrong!These diapers are very absorbent, but not bulky. They have super-comfy wide, stretchy closure tabs, and the fit is very generous but does not gap. They fit so much better than the pampers, I am astonished. And while the pampers are too small, even though our daughter is 10 lbs under the maximum recommended weight, these diapers still fit perfectly.Also, the conventional diapers seem to irritate her skin - she is always just a little red when I change her if she's wearing a conventional diaper. With these, she is never red at all.From now on, this is all I am buying!"
11477,0,"We purchased the Fisher Price Private Connection monitor because of its long range and rechargeable battery. As a whole, we have been very pleased with it. The reception is incredible (we can pick up our neighbors talking outside), the range is great (we've used it in several different multi-level houses, in hotels from a room or two away, and from our neighbor's house when our son was home at our house), and though the charge on the receiver batteries no longer gets us through the night, it lasts from his bedtime until ours and we can plug them in / charge them while we sleep. We've had the occasional problem with static, but what monitor doesn't?However, after 18 months of use (and not abuse, I might add), they now pick up a background buzzing noise. It seems that the transmitter is the culprit here - both receivers pick it up, it has nothing to do with the location or the channel. It's loud enough that the first light on the receiver is always illuminated, and there is no way I can sleep with it on. They are still functional if you don't mind the noise or are only using this during the day. I expected a longer life from something I paid $70 for."
1333,1,"Pampers is by far the best type on diapers. The only one I'd ever buy. I have been supplying my grandson with diapers from birth, and he's never had any leaks or discomfort. I am really always happy to do my purchases from Amazon versus baby.com (1800diapers.com) as they charge a fee for shipping. Amazon is free. I will continue to purchase for my grandson and other family members who want to have a large stock at all times. I really like the bulk packaging."
6591,0,I have always always used cruisers. (my kids get a rash from Huggies) This time the entire box had defective diapers. One whole side of the diap must have got too hot. The elastic was stuck to the diap. Had I purchased it locally I would have returned the entire 140 diaps I bought!! Not so easy to do with Amazon!! I complained to the company who sent me $20 worth of coupons. That's about 1/2 of the price of the diaps. I probably won't buy diapers through Amazon again.
114561,1,I bought this product as a gift for my niece. The ability you have to carry it everywhere makes you free so you don't have to look for a chair in a restaurant or anywhere. You also know that the chair is hygienic and clean at the moment of eating because it's you who clean it not like the public chairs they place on Malls or Restaurants that anyone can use and are sometimes with spills or leftovers. It's very convenient and the price is low. The children are safe while they're eating and it's comfortable.
69154,1,"I've been using Pamper's Cruisers for my son since he was 6 months. They have never leaked, and fit him comfortably. The stretchy sides are great when he blows out his stomach which makes it impossible to get a tight fit in other diapers."
181100,1,my 4 month old son loves this gym!! keeps him busy for more time than any other gym he has had.
42121,2,"I like the size of this cup, the softness of the spout, the cleanability, and the handles. What I don't like is that it LEAKS LIKE MAD!I don't know if it's my daughters technique, or the cup itself, but every time she takes the spout out of her mouth, a large portion of milk runs down her chin and soaks the front of her shirt.If the silicone top is not lined up absolutely perfectly (and my baby has a way of causing it to become misaligned) then it leaks from around the gasket. Also, whenever she drops the cup it always seems to land with the weight of the cup pressing on the spout, allowing the contents to flow out onto her tray or the floor. It is a huge mess maker."
110329,1,"This rocker glider is very nice. Some of the reviews on the Stork Craft rockers sounded scary. So, I decided to spend a bit more. The assembly was pretty simple. The ottoman is basically already assembled. The only thing is that there is some sort of ""squidgy"" sounding squeak. It's not that loud, so I'm not worried about it. Some of the reviews mentioned concern with the width of the rocker. I'm about 20 lbs overweight and have a pretty sizable behind and I have just about 1 inch on each side of me, which doesn't leave much space for my Boppy if I want to nurse my daughter with it in the rocker."
89356,0,"We have been using these with our daughter for several months and overall we are happy with them, she is a long baby and Huggies had a tendency to leak and she would wriggle out of them. We have very few urine leaks and they hold up well overnight, it is a little disturbing how much liquid they will hold! We have had issues with poop leakage going up her back, I probably have to change 2-3 outfits a week, another reviewer had the same issue. I do highly recommend them for overnight use though."
6944,2,the cost of these diapers are way more than you would pay at any local retailer or national chain...then to use a coupon on top of that...wow what a difference. Save your money and shipping costs and go to Target. Do price per diaper comparisons and you would be surprised how much diapers cost and how to save money!!
177074,1,"I LOVE this gate. I started with the Soft & Wide gate and it was a dud for us. The problem was that my 2 older children would have to climb over it. Every time my 7 year old attempted it, she would make the gate pop out of place. And my 3 year old had a hard time getting over it by himself. If that wasn't bad enough, my 1 year old twins discovered that they could hang on the middle of the gate and it would pop out of place.So, then I decided to fork over the money for this gate. It is absolutely wonderful and worth EVERY penny for the peace of mind it gives me. My twins have not been able to budge it. And, even better, my two older children can open it by themselves."
130131,1,"I purchased this swing for my unborn child (my first) after reading all of the reviews. My son absolutely adores it! He has been using it since shortly after he was born. He is now 3 months old and can finally enjoy the mobile. I haven't ever used the front-to-back motion since he seems to enjoy the cradling. I just noticed today that the batteries are starting to slow down and he uses it every day, sometimes for long naps. It is quite large and isn't very portable but I knew that when I bought it so I have a bouncer seat as a more portable option. I don't find the sound of the mobile that loud but the sound of the swing itself rocking back and forth takes some getting used to. You do have to use a blanket or a towel to slow it down in the beginning but that wasn't a problem, and yes, it stinks that the music doesn't stay on for longer periods but all in all, it's well worth buying!"
10732,1,"This item is great. Holds every size bottle, plus my breast pump. It's easy to clean. Meets all my needs."
104583,1,"I'm almost five months pregnant with my first baby, and this pillow has been a sleep-saver. Before I got it, I would toss and turn all night trying to get comfortable. The fact that it supports your head, tummy and keeps your knees apart to even out your spine as well as supports your back does the trick. And as I type this review on my laptop, I'm using it as support for sitting up in bed inside the curve. If your pregnant and having trouble sleeping because your trying to use a regular pillow between your knees and using your hand or a wedge pillow to support your tummy, you might like this a lot better. It's very comfortable and altough I think it really should be at least $10 less than it is, it's been worth it to me. Getting a good nights sleep is too imortant. Probably the only drawback is when you want to flip it over at night to change sides-sometimes the sheets and covers get caught on it while your trying to do this. But the first night I got it, I actually slept through the night for the first time, only waking once."
100425,1,Bought for my Granddaughter as requested by her. Says help keep son dry and he has less problem with diaper rash.
184273,0,"This was bought for us second hand by a well meaning friend. Unfortunately we can't cosleep due to a sleep disorder I live with that makes me unsafe. (Night Terrors) But we have gotten uses out of it. It's great when baby is fussy and we want him in the living room with us, we can just put him in the sleeper on the couch and we don't have to worry about him rolling off. We send it with him to grandma's house for the same purpose. Of course baby should still not be left unatended because when they decide to roll, some netting isn't going to stop them. But at least with this we can sit in our own chair in the same room instead of putting him in his crib.Overall, it's a nice product, but I personally feel it's overpriced."
16690,2,"This bottle is good in that it does not leak, BUT my toddler has bitten through and ingested someone of the straw. Also, I did not realize until I received the package that this product does not say it is BPA free. I will not be purchasing again and have to throw out the product after a single use due to the straw damage."
113379,2,"When I bought this monitor, I thought it would be really neat that it could go anywhere, but the parent unit uses batteries like crazy. If this was the main problem I would be happy, but there is more...Another thing, after only having the unit for 3 months, It stopped working all together over night for no reason. The lights worked but no sound came out. It would work only if you banged it on the table or blow through the speaker...I even thought about buying one of those pumps to keep pumping air into the speaker!!! I cannot replace it since I am now working for a couple of years abroad, so I decided to buy one from SONY, which is a brand I can trust. This time I looked at the reviews FIRST. I would not recommend this model at all, only if you like a lot of stactic and interference, together with headache that does not work."
114941,1,"We have had 3 different booster chairs between our house and my 17 month-old daughter's 2 grandmother's houses and this one is by far the best. I won't restate what all the other reviewers have said because I agree with all of them, but I will list the reasons I love this chair over all the others:1) It has 3 height settings to use with different tables or chairs. We use this without the tray at home and I can scoot my daughter up to her belly at the big table. Others that have the attached tray must be used with the tray at all times. It makes her feel like such a big girl to be sitting with us!2) The straps adjust very easily and quickly for installation and removal. Simply let out the length of the straps, snap them around the back of the chair and underneath the chair, then pull out the slack. Tight and secure in seconds.3) This chair folds up so easily and you can lengthen one of the straps to carry it over your shoulder. Frees up your hands to carry other things. This is handy when you are traveling and have to make several trips to and from the car with all of the gear you travel with when you have a toddler!4) This one is more sturdy than other boosters. This is made of thick, sturdy plastic and still looks new after being taken on our past 4 trips (in and out of houses, hotels, restaurants and the car).I highly recommend this booster!"
101587,1,I love this bottle drying rack. It doesn't take up a lot of space and looks and workds great!
80499,1,These are the best diapers by far. They are the only diapers I can find that have stretchy tabs to fit around your baby more snuggly and comfortably. They also have a very nice smell to them. I only wish they came in sizes higher than 2.
19536,1,"The top of the table is bigger than i thought it would be, which is great. There is plenty of room for 2 kids to color / play.The chairs were quick to assemble but the table is a little more complex with tons of allan head screws and some side screw thingies. They provide a manual allan wrench but you really need a screwdriver for the poles underneath the table. Luckily, I had some help or I would've pulled my hair out.The chairs do hold the weight of an adult, like one reviewer said, but I wouldn't wanna test it too much. I mean they are sturdy but tiny.Washable crayons come off but only if you do it within an hour. Some was left on for about 5 hours and baby wipes and bleach wipes didn't take it all off. You could still faintly see it. However, I had just bought some Plexus to clean our plastic toys and thought I'd try it on the table. It worked great - no more crayon whatsoever and it restores the manufacturer shine that the wipes slightly took away.I will write a review for Plexus when I take on the outside toys.Overall, this is well worth the price to me because my daughter loves it and I know it will last a long time."
102227,1,"I went to BRU to buy a DuoGlider when I found out my 2nd child would actually be my 3rd too. I wanted a stroller that could accomidate infant carriers and the DuoGlider seemed the best. Right before I purchased the Bently Bear DuoGlider (which I wasnt too pleased about using) I saw this beauty... perfect solution! It can accomidate SnugRide Infant carriers very very securely! It manuvers very well (my B/G twins were born on 12/20, right in time for Christmas Shopping in the mall! You can just imagine the tight quarters!) There is a little parents station for our drinks, keys ect... When my babies are sleeping in the car (now almost 5 months) I dont have to wake them, I can easily transfer them into the stroller. Its great to take on walks now and I couldnt be happier. It fits well into the trunk of my Range Rover and takes up very minimal space. Its also easy to go Grocery Shopping with my husband, I push the cart and he pushes this LIGHT WEIGHT stroller!!! The basket is easily accesable and can fit anything you want in it no problem. I will be using this stroller for a long time (twins are in 13th percentile!). Its just so great and a much better option then those bulky tandems,. we even bought a Savvy to eventually replace this! My now 2 year old son has even ridden in the basket (with out the infant carriers in). This stroller is just superb, couldnt ask for anything more!"
172287,2,This was a waste of money. We couldn't get baby to stay still in it.
99694,1,"great quality, great price, never leaks, no blowouts = win!We only purchase pampers diapers now. The cute pattern of sesame street is nice to have, the tabs are soft and easily visable (pale green) rather than having to look for them, they're obvious. These smell good and stack well. We are big fans"
134066,2,My previous warmer wore out over time and it was replaced with this thing. It doesn't keep all the wipes warm. I can only put a small stack in at a time because if I fill it full the top ones are cold and the bottom ones are warm.
38814,1,"I originally purchased this product after I brought my baby home from the hospital and attempted to bathe him in the infant bath tub. I hated it because he looked so uncomfortable and it didn't hold much water, making him get cold. He loved his safer bather. It has been so comfortable for him to actually lay in the bath tub and relax. It does eventually start to mildew, so I replaced it for another one because I liked it so much. I give my baby 2 baths a day usually so it has been well worth the money and gotton a lot of use."
45980,1,"Our 10-week-old has loved looking at this mobile for 2-3 weeks! We're amazed at how interested he continues to be. I wish the attachment fitting had options for how to attach it, but it seems to stay on ok."
133522,1,"My newborn has a voracious appetite, and would suck so hard that she would end up coughing and gagging at every feeding! It got to the point that I was nervous every time I fed her! Then I realized that she only did that with the Medela nipples (I had bought both the Medela nipples, which I had placed on Evenflo glass bottles, as well as the BornFree bottles in order to have several options). As soon as I went back to the BornFree bottles, even though she continued to suck hard, she no longer coughed and gagged!! SO IF YOUR BABY COUGHS AND GAGS WITH FEEDINGS, GET THESE! YOU WON'T BE SORRY!Also, regarding the review that stated that the bottles ""morphed into blobs"", she MUST have been doing SOMETHING wrong as far as the microwave sterilization is concerned (?maybe not adding water), because that definitely does NOT happen! (Best bet is to use the Born Free microwave sterilizer.) Also, as far as customer service, I also had a good experience - I had e-mailed them requesting instructions for the sterilizer, and received a very quick response!Overall, an EXCELLENT product, WELL WORTH THE $$$!"
137150,0,"My thoughts on the Floral Garden Valances are that the photo caught me off guard. I misread and thought that I was purchasing the curtains in the listed photo. Nope. I received two pretty purple valances, that have cute floral designs. They were long in length and were seemingly of good quality. I didn't want to send them back because of the hassle of waiting.So know that you are only buying the valances and not the curtains. They are in the photo I guess to enhance the valances look. I just used them to put on the wall attached to curtain rods above my girls' beds like a headboard decoration. It works and is a different look that adds character too their room.All in all, ok buy."
23631,1,"The seat works great, is easy to use and easy to clean - but it took me a bit to figure out how to keep the mess from landing in my toddler's lap on its way to his mouth. The solution? Buy a toddler place mat with this hook-on chair."
25040,1,We bought this gate after seeing it used at a friends house. We use it to keep the 2 1/2 yr old and the dog downstairs. It's easy enough though for the 7 yr old to open it with no problem.We also have 6 in wide oak trim at the bottom of the stairs and we liked the fact that we didn't have to drill holes into the wall to mount. Would definetly recommend this product to someone with small children or pets.
63243,0,"Overall, this pacifier was good, but every time it was dropped it did not close like it was supposed to. It completely defeated the purpose."
183110,0,"I really like this bag. We purchased it for travel then it became the daycare bag. Unfortunately, it began to tear where the strap attaches to the bag. The zipper also began to pull apart. If Baby Trend used a better quality fabric, this would be the perfect diaper bag - plenty of room, and easy to find what you need."
88225,1,"I love the bag and my husband has no problems carrying it. I just wish it had a little more width. The depth is great, but since it is a little narrow, it can be hard to see/find things that sink to the bottom. (The other style by this compnay may be better in that respect.)Because of the style and pockets/handle design this is by far better than any I saw in the stores."
47695,1,"I purchased this not really knowing what to expect. The sheets fit tightly, but I had no problems putting them on compared to the other fitted crib sheets I've used. The sheets were softer than I anticpated too. They do wrinkle since they are 100% cotton, but are still good quality for the price."
10972,1,The best thing about this product is that it is VERY easy to clean. No hidden crevices. A little low for a short toddler but overall a very good product.
164182,1,"We have twin boys and one has more of a flat head than the other. I like this ""donut pillow"" (as we call it) a lot. I mostly use it in the jumpy chairs and the car seat. He doesn't love using it on the playmat though. I think it's great for plagiocephaly-prevention."
183832,1,I make my own baby food and these come in so handy when defrosting the baby food I have made! They also are great for snacks and it's all in one bag. Great price and they are long lasting.
96529,1,"I think this is the best highchair, It is really sturdy and durable, and can hold baby into his toddler years. After my son was thoroughly able to sit up, I removed the pad and now clean up is super fast. Also, the plastic tray doesn't stain, we even have had tomato sauce on it, wipes clean every time. We are also going to unscrew the plastic front when he's older and use it as a booster at the table. I only wish that it had detatchable wheels, you have to pick it up to move it. oh well. Great highchair."

174903,1,There is a photo someone posted of their kid in the tub and it is the most dangerous scenario you could imagine. Look at the one with the tub on the countertop and all the electrical outlets behind with things plugged in. If your kid started splashing it could short out the electric or if the tub overflowed and water got on the counter there could be a serious danger of electric shock with the plugged in electric toothbrush and hair dryer.. Not to mention how close the tub is to the edge of the countertop and hanging over the sink. I cannot believe those people really didn't think about safety before giving their kid a bath there. That electric outlet is not GHI (which is now a type of outlet required by law at least around here) so therefore it will not shut off should an electric shock occur. I hope their kid is ok but please whatever you do.. be conscious of where you give your kid a bath. The tub is awesome by the way.. really great especially when your baby is a bit wobbly when sitting up or learning to.
39107,0,"The style of the diaper is adorable but having said that my baby is only 12lbs/3mos and these diapers are too small for her. I suggest ordering the M/L size if your baby is not a newborn. Also, I used a Thirsties Fab Doubler every time with this diaper because the entire diaper gets completely saturated in a very short period of time which is why it might be better for a newborn. I prefer the traditional pre-folds myself and they are definitely more economical."
48537,1,"I love the size of the display. Video is very clear and reception is much clearer than other monitors I have tried. My only negative about this monitor is sometimes it glitches and cuts out for just a split second. Not sure why it does this, but still a really great monitor."
21230,0,"My husband put the swing together last night, we were shocked to find that the swing goes entirely too fast, just as another person stated, even on the slowest speed. We will wait until the baby arrives to see if maybe her weight will slow it down, if not, it will have to go back. It swings so fast, I would imagine it might make the baby throw up! Another issue is there is no option to turn the music off, once you turn it on, you have to wait 15 minutes for it to go off...pretty silly! Everything that looks good doesn't always work good."
30321,0,"Nice crib set for the price, but the bumper and bed skirt does not fit as well as I would have liked it to. But it can be altered with a few tweaks. The sheet and quilt are made from quality material which is a plus for the price."
134336,0,"I bought this for my little one who had a winter birthday while we were living in a cold climate. I thought that perhaps diaper changes would be a little less traumatic if the wipes weren't so cold. I discovered that it didn't really make a difference and he cried just the same. It did a good job of keeping the wipes warm, but by the time you get to the bottom of the wipes, they were mostly dried out (and ""reconstituting"" dry wipes just isn't the same.) There is a sponge inside the warmer that you need to ensure stays moist all the time that is supposed to help I presume... it just seemed like it wasn't worth the money overall."
161464,2,"We registered for this tub, before doing any research. Big mistake. As a newborn, I used the sling to bathe my son. As he got bigger, I put the sling into the tub (2nd way of the 4-1 system). Bath time became a pain. My son kept sliding down, even with one hand on him at all times. He didn't really seem to enjoy it either. Finally, after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath. LOVE IT!!!!! From day one my son had a great time in his new (huge) tub. He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub, with no slipping. He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash. We've had it over a month, I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub."
95121,1,"When I was pregnant I was still not sure what I wanted to do, Did I want to nurse, or formula feed so I bought a cheap pump at Target. After a rough delivery, and a small and sick baby my Dr. talked me into breast feeding for the benefit of us. After 3 weeks with my cheap and pathetic pump, I finally had enough. A friend of mine had raved about her Swing, and I was a bit skeptical (This is the same friend mind you who talked me into buying some stupid things for my son that I would ""Need"" and never touched). After reading reviews I decided to order one. I was shocked (Pleasantly this time) to use this pump for the first time and not hate the entire experience. I don't find it loud at all, despite some of the people who have reviewed this item. It is comfortable and it even fits the storage bottles I had purchased for my other pump. Its easy to use, and works fairly quickly! I recommend this to anyone and everyone! Even if for some reason it does not hold up until my next child (I plan to nurse until my son can be on cows milk) I would purchase it again. It is great and I've been able to pump after every feeding and do well.Medela Swing Breast Pump"
131019,0,"We spent a significant amount of time looking at double jogging strollers online and in stores (good luck finding any to look at). We purchased this one for our 18 month old 35 lb. kid and our newborn (now 15 lbs.).1. It came mostly assembled and took 10 minutes to complete assembly. Came with rain cover, which works pretty well (if you remember to put it on :) ).2. Nice wide canopy to sheild from sun.3. Seat incline system is primitive. The most upright setting is not straight enough for our 18 month old, so we have to put blankets under his head. Unfortunately, the folds of fabric fold into the childs head / shoulder area and look like they could cause some discomfort (haven't registered any complaints from the kids on that yet).4. No snack or cup holders for parents or children.5. Small underseat storage, but easy to get to. We just carry some diapers, wipes, a bottle, snacks and water...don't need much room.6. Tires need to be pumped up at least once a week.7. Very HARD to turn if you are short. I am 5 ft. 3 and it is difficult. Hubby is 6 ft. 3 and is OK for him. (See #4 re: drink holder, hard to drink a cup of Starbucks and walk at the same time).Overall, it seems durable and rolls pretty well if the tires are properly inflated.I'm looking for another stroller to walk with because this thing is too hard for me to turn (equivalent to weight lifting, muscle-aches the next day and lots of spilled Java). Also, the squirels in our yard liked the canopy and at a couple of holes in it (this is probably just a personal issue, but I thought I'd share anyway)."

55206,1,"I have triplet boys that are currently potty training. I did a decent amount of research on a stepping device to help them get onto the potty because I was worried about them being in a hurry, running into the bathroom and subsequently causing carnage and mayhem. We have various step stools in the house to help them reach faucets in the bathroom and the counter in the kitchen. While effective in giving them vertical aid, the steps slide on the floor or tip over when toddler feet get to tap dancing about (because we all know they can't stay still). Toothbrushing is an Olympic sport in my house. Meanwhile, the stool I have in the kitchen folds, so its a finger squashing nightmare because they can't just leave anything alone, can they? I wanted something that I could leave in place all of the time that I didn't have to worry about if the kids needed to get onto the potty when I couldn't be right there in an instant. It's not uncommon for me to be in one bathroom with one kid when the other has to go in another bathroom, so having the secure potty stool gives me piece of mind that they won't tumble off the step and crack their melon on the potty. Truth be told, it is expensive, so what. It works well and it is worth the investment. The kids will be using it for a long time as they won't be tall enough to get on an off the pot for awhile. What I like about this stool is that it is stable; it has the arm handles to help the kids take a step up, it has enough space on the step itself to allow them to turn around and take their pants off so I don't have to worry about them falling off an unstable step or attempting to climb onto a step with their pants around their ankles. I like that the kids have a place to rest their arms because when they are potty training- you do an absolute ton of waiting. They may as well be comfortable. Finally, I put their books, flutes, crayons, stuffed animals and all other distraction devices in a bag that hangs on one of the handles. This way they don't have to reach for anything and have entertainment at their fingertips. Get it- its worth it."
164307,1,it won't go wrong with pampers. i used to use Hugies. Now I swith to pampers. I like the smell and compacity.
69730,1,the gate is very sturdy however the wall pads have slipped about 2x. we use it for our two puppies and they have had full reign of the house b/c of it...otherwise - its a great gate. just make sure the wall pads are very secure.i love the remote control - and haven't had a problem with the batteries.
55595,1,"I love this bottle warmer. It is very easy to use, which is great for those 3 am feedings. It is warms the bottles quickly, it usually takes about 2-4 mins. I have had no problems over heating or under heating my plastic bottles, however I did with the Playtex nursers. (That was fine because my little girl didn't like those bottles anyways! they were too big for her face and covered up her nose.)One of the other things that I like about the bottle warmer is the size, it is perfect size and takes up very little space on the countertop. And I love the way the little water measuring cup attaches to the side, that way you won't lose it. This is a definite must have for all moms. I can't say enought good thing about it."
144382,1,"I consider these diaper sacks an essential in our house - the scent is very light and not overpowering, which is good because I generally don't like lavender, and they truly do block odors. We put diapers in these and just throw them in our regular trash, with no lid, and there is no smell whatsoever. I have the travel dispenser from Sassy in my diaper bag but I prefer these sacks because the handles make them really easy to tie."
80681,2,"These pull ups are really small. It's like they put the wrong size in the box. My child leaked all over the place last night in bed. What a mess to wake up to??? Too small for the size that they claimed that they are. It looked more like a size 3. Would not recommend buying these tiny pull ups!!! (my child is in the 10% range, too. not a big child.)"
71078,1,"My friend owned one of these and when I was visiting her house my little 1 1/2 month old became super fussy so we put him in it. To our surprise he stopped fussing immediately. Our baby has continued to be fussy and the doctor suggested a seat like this that vibrates. She said its good for fussy babies and possibly colic. We ordered one (price was EXCELLENT) and we LOVE it! Our little man starts fussin' and when I can't settle him or calm him, I put him in the chair and turn on the vibrating part on and he stops! I'm not sure what it is but it's great to have something that helps your baby be more comfortable. I put him in this to do dishes and to put my make up on, eat dinner...basically anything that I need to put him down for. He absolutely LOVES it! This is an excellent product! Our baby is now over 2 months old and still loves it. It converts to a toddler chair so I see us using this a LONG time. What a great buy! :)"
56043,1,"The gate is great and works perfectly! Go ahead and buy a set of longer screws or anchors to install with the gate. We have two of these, and ended up having to do that to both of them after they came out of the wall when opening!"
93471,1,I purchased this potty for my daughter as an extra or &quot;downstairs&quot; potty. Our house has a lot of stairs and moving the potty around became a real pain. This potty was inexpensive so I felt it would be a good extra. We have had no problems with leakage. In fact it has been great. It is incredibly easy to clean. We haven't had a problem with the batteries either. My daughter loves the comfort of the seat and she feels special when she hears the Ta Da music. Maybe the leaking has to do with the differences between the way boys and girls use it. It seemed that most of the negative comments came from the caregivers of boys.
142097,1,"I have had kids using Avent pacifiers for over 6 years (not the same one!). I prefer these as the shield curves away from the face and spit does not collect under the shield, as with the old style ones (that chapped face thing rarely happens with these."
142534,0,"Just bought this from a local Target tonight. Instructions are mediocre, and could be improved - for instance, why is it necessary to insert the rails under the mattress then shorten the rails by a peg? Unless your mattress is made of granite, you could easily get the right width by measuring, then wedging the mattress to the bottom of the rails. The way the instructions are stated you have to simultaneously hold your mattress up far enough to push in the peg with a screwdriver while also constricting the rail to fit into the next closest peg - not easy at all if you're installing without someone to help.Also, the pegs themselves are of poor quality - one on our assembly would not slide back through the hole until I pulled it out of the rod, straightened, and reinserted it. If I'd left it as it was the assembly could shift with weight, negating the entire reason I purchased the product.Finally, getting the fabric assembly around the rails was very difficult. The structure must be taut, which explains some of the difficulty - you don't want your child to get caught in loose fabric - but I'm not sure why this part doesn't come assembled from the manufacturer.Haven't tested the assembled product yet. If there are flaws during use I'll post again."
10654,2,"Don't waste you money or your counterspace.This item is something that my wife &quot;had to have&quot; for our first baby. We used it for less than a month before it went back in the box. We use the wide mouth Avent bottles, and the rack doesn't hold more than six bottles. The wide mouth bottles also had a tendancy to fall off the holders and roll into the sink. It wasn't long before we packed it up and just started putting the bottles in the dishrack with the dishes."
42550,1,"During the decision-making process regarding buying the wrap, I watched probably 2 or 3 dozen YouTube videos, read about what problems people had with it, and worried endlessly about whether the wrap would fit on my plus-size frame. As it happens, the wrap is plenty long enough for me and my toddler to both fit in easily. I can see this becoming a staple once my pregnancy is over and I'm ready to start wearing my newborn.Also, maybe this is only because I antagonized over my decision to buy the wrap, but as soon as I pulled it out of the box it shipped in, I was able to put my 16-month old toddler right in it without any problem. I can't figure out why so many people have had issues figuring it out. Watch a few videos first instead of trying to figure it out on your own, and it's cake!"
13042,1,"I bought this item b/c I'm due to have my twin boys in a month from now. I want them to share a crib in the early months. So- I haven't actually had a chance to use it but have heard some good things from other twin moms. The only thing that disappointed me so far was that you can't secure it to your crib if you have a crib bumper. The velco tabs are in the middle of the sides so it won't work around the bumper. But- it's made of foam and is a pretty tight fit that won't move easily even if you don't have it ""attached"" to the crib so this should be fine in the beginning when they aren't big enough to shove it or move it."

132959,0,"I've had the opportunity to use the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ, and this product. The Diaper Genie was actually the easiest to use and kept the odor to a bare minimum. Using the Dekor is a little awkward, especially if it is full, since tying the bag up by hand can be a pain. Also, when inserting diapers, it's easy to get a ""noseful"" when inserting a fresh diaper, since all the dirty diapers are in the same space and the device opens briefly. The Genie, on the other hand, seperated the individual diapers with twists in the bag, creating a long diaper-link-sausage effect (ewww... a gross image, I know). The final twist when it's full makes it easy to tie off to. If you use cloth diapers, though, the Dekor is great; it holds a lot, and you don't have to untwist every diaper to wash them (or send them to the service)."
92982,0,it was received as directed. It is sturdy and well fit for a toddler. xo xo xo xo xo xo
126672,1,I tried all the other diapers available in the market and this is the best out there.My son who is now 9 mths has been using these for more than 7 mths and has not had a single rash since I started using them and amazon offers the best price considering that they are shipped free and no taxes......
116152,1,"Well, I agree with almost all the positive talk about this high chair - I LOVE the fact that it's so easy to clean - my biggest beef with our old high chair was that the tray was so large, it was really difficult to clean and the fabric padding meant frequent trips to the washing machine - this high chair cleans up with a couple of wipes, which is a treat. The Flair is easy to move around (again, a problem with our old high chair) and it looks great. BUT - I have a big issue with the harness/straps. I didn't buy this chair until my child was 11 months and putting her in the harness is next to useless - the buckle the straps click into sits right between her legs, so there's nothing really holding the straps together - the harness should hold the straps together across her chest/stomach to keep her securely in the chair. Because the straps clip on to the harness so low, the straps mostly just slip off her shoulders - so I'm relying completely on the tray to keep her from falling out of the high chair. Hopefully soon the chair will be mostly used as a toddler chair, pulled up to a table, so I won't have to worry about the straps - but now it's a bit of a concern. Oh - and also, I was ticked off that the second snap-on tray that comes with the high chair was 100% covered in a sticker touting the features of the Flair chair - but it's impossible to get off! I've even tried to scrape it off with a knife, and it's barely coming off - as a result, I really only have 1 tray that I can use, which is a drag."
109204,0,"I was reluctant to purchase this item after reading mixed reviews. However, my son really enjoys sitting up and playing, but is not yet able to sit unsupported. The tray provides him with that option, but I'm going to have to agree with some of the other reviews that stated the tray did not quite hook onto the seat the way they had hoped. For my young baby it does the job...but once he gains more control of his motor skills, I have no doubt that the tray will go flying across the room :("
129054,1,"I bought the NUK bottle/nipple when trying to find one that my son would take for expressed breastmilk. The shape is extremely similar to the shape of mom's nipple when feeding and I noticed that my baby held this nipple with his tongue and lips in much the same way as when he was feeding from me. Also, because the milk comes out of the nipple at the roof of the baby's mouth, he is less likely to choke on milk shooting down his throat.Because I didn't want to spend too much money on new bottles, I tried to give my son the Playtex Nurser I used for my first baby. He wasn't having it -- and five months later he still prefers the NUK.I highly encourage other moms to try one bottle and see what they think. Your baby will love how soft and natural this nipple is in his/her mouth."
13584,2,"I was so prepared to love this. We bought the crib a few months ago... received this for a shower gift and were sorely disappointed. When I opened the package, screws and parts fell out. Nothing was bagged. Additionally, there were NO instructions. The changing table is NOT made by the same company that the crib is. The lack of quality in the materials is glaring once the package is opened. Secondly, I received 2 of the same ends. Hard to explain, but basically its like having 2 left shoes. I could have put this together, but holes would have been exposed to the outside, being unslightly. I did finally, _almost_ get this together, without instructions, just to have a wood piece pull apart and splinter, damaging the wood beyond repair. Needless to say, I returned this. I didn't bother getting a changing table! Hope you have better luck!"
121190,2,THIS CHAIR DOES NOT BOUNCE IT IS VERY STIFF AND THE VIBRATING DIDN'T DO A THING FOR MY CHILD. I HAVE ANOTHER CHAIR SIMILIAR BUT IT BOUNCES AND HAS A LITTLE MASSAGER FOR THE BACK THAT ONE IS A LIFE SAVER HE GOES RIGHT TO SLEEP IN IT. THE ONE I LIKE IS FISHER PRICE.
109191,0,"I bought this tray after I got a bumbo (which is great btw) as a gift for my son. The problem is it is way too difficult to put this tray on and take it off. You are supposed to get the bottom of the tray hooked onto the bottom of the bumbo but it requires you to stretch the tray a little so it will fit under. Needless to say when you have a squirmy baby in the bumbo it makes the task much harder. The bumbo is great for your 4 month old to start sitting up. But if your child can sit up I recommendFisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat, Red/Whitefor mealtimes. It attaches to a regular chair which makes it easier to feed your baby as you sit in a chair next him. Your technically only supposed to use the bumbo at ground level; so, I would sit on the floor with him or put him in the bumbo on the table and watch him like a hawk for fear he would flip himself. The bumbo is great, but use a highchair or booster chair for mealtime."
78494,2,"The double pump is really slow even when plugged in. Using both pumps does not have the force as just using one of the pumps so unless you are really full, don't count getting much.

148262,2,"I got this potty for my 22 month old and he is too big for it. It's pretty funny that the website lists ages 24 months to 6 years old. My son is very tall for his age, but by no means the size of a 6 year old! It might make a good potty for a doll oor something."
176541,0,I've used these bottles since my sons were born.-I love the fact that they are extremely easy to clean and the liners are very convenient. (but are getting expensive.)

At first I thought the instructions looked a little sketchy but it was actually pretty easy to install and the only tool i used was a regular phillips screwdriver. It is very easy to open with one hand and easy to adjust if needed. Our baby isn't old enough to test it out on kids yet, but it has worked great with our dogs so far and seems to be very sturdy. It looks very nice as well...much better than the plain adjustable wood gates or the bulky plastic ones. I would definatley recommend."

169389,1,"This bedding was exactly what I was looking for! I love the different patterns and textures. The bumper and blanket are very soft and the sheet is jersey knit (also very soft). I expected the blanket to be heavier--more like the weight of a comforter but it's lighter and more like a blanket. However, I think the weight is actually perfect since it will just be used sometimes since baby shouldn't sleep with it in the bed anyway. Overall I love this set!"

50148,0,"This carrier was given to me at my baby shower.I found it to be too big for my daughter until she was about six months old and fourteen pounds. We used and loved the Baby Bjorn until she got too big for it and we transitioned to the Snugli. She is now 14 months and 20 lbs.My husband and I both find the Snugli to be too complicated and somewhat uncomfortable. The padded shoulder straps are bulky and a little stiff, even after much use.There are too many movable straps, and they are in the way (although there are pockets in which you can put some of the ends to get them out of the way). It can be a hassle to adjust it right, and our adjustments have slipped out of place a couple of times. Most of the time they do stay in place. Using it did get easier as we became accustomed to the design.The places where the straps are exposed (or not padded) can be abrasive against necks and arms. My daughter also used to lean her neck against the little straps over her shoulders and get little abrasions on her neck when she was smaller and could shift around more in the carrier.The rubber traction on the padded shoulder straps is a bit too clingy with the thickness of the pads, and can be hard to swing over my shoulders when she is in the Snugli in backpack position. I also fear I'll trap her arm or leg in a strap when I'm pulling her on, but that has yet to happen.I never use the vibration pad, the head shield, or the cup holder, since they are decidedly inconvenient and in the way. And since it's too big to use for a 5th-percentile-weight baby under six months, I never used the pockets on it as a front carrier. Of course you can't reach them using it as a back carrier.It has been very useful for our basic needs, and we use it several times per week. It is reasonably comfortable once it's on, most of the time, but there's always something that bothers us about it.The design could be softer, there could be fewer adjustment points, and the padded shoulder straps could be less bulky and more conforming to the body. However, the shoulder pads are an excellent width (for a less bulky shoulder pad).I do like how easily I can secure my daughter in the body of the carrier by laying her down on top of it on the bed or on the ground, and even sitting upright in a chair (that's a little more tricky). The slip/lock mechanisms on each side are especially nice and easy to deal with, once you take a moment to figure out how to work them.The little straps that snap over her shoulders are easy, although I've painfully pinched myself with them a few times. When the latches latch on this thing, they snap! Ow!My daughter is also beginning to dislike the straps over her shoulders, now, and it would be nice if they were slightly padded.So, in short, it's useful and not a terrible product, but you could definitely find better."
120257,1,"We bought these nipples for our daughter when she was about 5 months old. She has always used the Dr. Brown bottles. We started mixing a bit of rice cereal into her bottles and she couldn't get the thicker mixture through the level 1 nipples. So we switched to the next size on the advice of a friend and they work great. One warning, though... without the rice cereal she'll drink a 5-6 oz. bottle in 3 minutes which is a little too fast.The level 1 nipples lasted over 3 months, and I expect these will prove just as durable. We wash them almost every day (in the handy Dr. Brown's bottle cages) and they hold up fine."

115886,1,"5 stars are obviously indicative of my love for this stroller. In an attempt to be brief and relevant and to keep from repeating the same sentiments of other fans of the stroller, I wanted to add a couple of things I didn't get from any of the other reviews:--Yes, there is a weight limit of about 40 lbs. HOWEVER, though not recommended by the manufacturer, I have WELL exceeded this ""limit"" on many occasions by using the stroller for both my children... at the same time. Yep, 80+ lbs of kids and still pushes like a dream. (My 5 year old son will sit in the stroller with his arms wrapped around his 3 year old sister sitting in his lap. I never intend on doing this, but sometimes, you just have to get out of the mall quickly or can't handle the whining of two tired children and only one stroller. So yes, I have definitely done this more times than I care to admit.) I say this not to insinuate that it could be used for this purpose all the time (because that would just be silly) but more so to speak to the quality of the aluminum frame and to ease your mind if the 40 lb. weight ""limit"" is holding you up. My almost 50 lb. 5 year old son will still hop in from time-to-time, and he is pushed just as easily now as when he was a baby.--Another hidden gem and surely unintended benefit of the stroller strap (meant to sling the closed stroller over your shoulder) is that it can be used as a guide for an older walking child. With my younger daughter in the stroller and my son insiting on walking, even at the age of 3, he would know that if he was going to walk, he HAD to hold on to the strap connected to the side of the stroller. Obviously, if you have a child that doesn't listen well or likes to run away, this wouldn't work for you, but for us, it allowed my son to walk on his own without bumping into the stroller yet kept him close enough for me to still guide him. Even now, at almost 6 years old, he knows if we are in a parking lot, he has to hold on to the strap.--Lastly, I wanted to comment on the ""storage"". I typically carry a large, over-the-shoulder purse, and I always slide it in between the ""x"" cross bars and the back of the seat of the stroller, so it's essentially in the basket, and it fits perfectly everytime! Also, on a recent trip to the mall, I left with a huge Pottery Barn bag with a queen size quilt & 4 quilted shams hanging from one handle and two moderately full clothing bags hanging from the other handle. When I got to the car and removed my child, the stroller did NOT tip over. In fact, I don't think it's ever tipped on me when not weighted down by a child. This is probably due to its wide wheel base giving it a low center of gravity.This review was WAY longer than I intended to write, but I hope if you're on the fence about purchasing, you will just give it a try. I understand not every stroller is going to work for every person, which is why there's thousands of them, but for our family, this is single-handedly the best baby/kid purchase we've made to date."
174485,1,"I could not use this on my crib, as we have a crib that is constructed with heavy, thick wood. So, I put it on my changing table. It is the best! Now my six month old son will turn on his side to hit the button to turn it on. It's almost a requirement for him to look at it while he's having his diaper changed. We use it several time daily and have only had to change the batteries once. I love the different interchangable pieces as well. Highly recommended!"
141484,1,OUR GRANDAUGHTER LOVES IT!!!!! IT'S A GREAT LEARNING TOOL FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND HELPS THEM WALK AS WELL..SHE IS HAVING A GREAT TIME WITH IT.
178453,1,"I'm on my third child. I used this with my first (now 4) in Manhattan. I used it with my second (now 2) in Europe, and I'm now on my third (8 weeks) in suburbia. It's one of the best purchases I've ever made and after four years of use I really feel confident recommending it.The quality is fantastic, it has faded a little from the sun, but overall works just as well as always. It is very easy to put on and adjust, even when I just started using it. The inside of the carrier has visual instructions sewn in so you never have to worry about not having the instructions around.On a lifestyle basis, I originally thought I'd wear this only with one baby, but it's just as useful now that I have other children in tow. I put the two year old in a stroller, and keep the infant in the baby bjorn. When I go grocery shopping I often don't even put my infant in the cart, I just keep him in the baby bjorn. Not only is it convenient to have him in the carrier, he doesn't fuss at all because he's so close to me. I also use it when I take my kids to the playground, and when I feel like taking a stroll. It's a nice change of pace from pushing around a big stroller. I also used it a lot around the house with one of my fussy babies. He liked to be close to me all the time and I was able to do laundry and wash dishes while keeping him comforted.I've never had any back pain with this other than some minor stiffness when I've kept my child in it for several hours.I can't recommend this product enough. I would pay three times the price because it is that worth it."
108425,1,"This is great, to be able to purchase a potty seat in your childs favorite Disney Movie!!! My sister was jealous that I had one for my son, and they didn't have them back when she potty trained. The seat is secure and seams comfortable to my little guys behind. The pee cup keeps pee from going outside the toilet, and the rubber protectors help keep the seat stable. Great item!!! Thanks"
165513,1,We have been using this brand for 8 months ever since we first tried them based on price. When my son was still nursing exclusively it prevented more blowouts and now as a toddler they rarely leak. There is no better major-brand diaper for the price.
171038,0,"I was thrilled to fill the album with family pics for my overseas granddaughter. But the cheap quality of this item did not justify the pricetag. The plastic pages were wrinkled, and made it harder to see the pictures.I needed to send it for her birthday- without the rush, I probably would have returned it. Who knows what my granddaughter will do with it- It's meant as a plaything, and I want her to become familiar with our faces. But for $12, this should have been in better condition."
90389,2,These diapers have been a huge disappointment! They claim to be Baby Dry but they don't keep anything dry. We've only been using them for a few days and every day we've had to change outfits because of wet diapers. The diaper doesn't even seem to absorb anything. As far as night protection? There's no way it offers 12 hours of protection. Maybe one or two and that's if you're willing to change the sheets.I'm going back to Luvs.
11593,1,"While going thru some packed items we ran across our Gerber Bottle Warmer and tested it out to see if it still worked and it did, 39 years later! This was absolutely the best item for both my time and my money. It is also refreshing to own good dependable, products and know they were made right her in the USA."
53574,1,"We needed a seat to attach to our home school classroom table so that our toddler (17m) could finger paint and such while the older kids did their lessons. This chair attached to the table very securely in 3min we were up and running...er sitting. The seat is deep and the fabric easy to clean. As I sit right with him while he does his ""school"" we haven't really used the 5 pt harness system though I do see that it would work well if needed. The seat will attach to tables with skirts...even larger ones as long as the skirt is not too deep under the table. For most tables this will be fine. On my 100yr old dinning table it does not work. However, I don't see how it would be a problem on most restaurant tables and the kitchen bars and tables at most of our friends/family homes. It is light weight and much easier to transport than the booster seat we have used with our older four kids, and its nice that it doesn't require a chair to attach to. Overall I like it and I think it does what its supposed to do. Ordering another for our 3m old to use in as soon as she can sit up on her own."
71339,2,They have a terrible odor and are impossible to remove from the box without tearing. Beyond flimsy. Buy the Seventh Generation wipes instead.
27145,0,"Good, but several of the plastic 'fans' inside broke pretty soon. I used it in chilly conditions but not with unreasonabe size mugs/bottles. Folding chassis with cup holder on works, but in general this is not up to Bugaboo standard."
94218,2,By the time my son could hold himself up in the seat and actually bounce he was too tall for this! What a waste of money. Do yourself a favor and get a freestanding bouncing seat.
52120,2,"First let me state that overall this is a good choice if you want a 5 point harness with higher weight limits.If that isnt what you are looking for, go elsewhere. I am the father of a 4.5 year old boy and 18 month old twins, so I have a little expertise in installing car seats in multiple cars.We've typically bought Britax but I didn't want to spend that kind of money for 2 Britax's and I wanted the 5 point harness.The quality of this seat doesn't compare to Britax, not by a long shot. The britax's are heavier and sturdier.The install is such a hassle on this. The tether strap tightening system is not easy at all and I cannot get a really tight tether on this seat in my Honda Odyssey.The latch system is impossible to use, as the only way to get the belt to tighten is to pull the strap in the path and direction of the lap seat belt, which is obstructed by the seat. The Britax seats only require you to pull up, and in this case, its straight up while applying some pressure with your knee to the seat.I have resorted to using a mighty tite and the seatbelt but I for the life of me cannot get a tight fit.I also noticed that the portion of the seat that comes in contact with the carseat is made of flexible and thin plastic. This is where the downward forces are exerted on the seat, and as you tighten the car seat to the vehicle's seat it causes this plastic to bow outward. I have contacted Dorel about this and they are replacing the seat, but only AFTER I have returned my original seat. Am I supposed to lap my child in the meantime?If you never plan on removing the seat or switching vehicles, get the tightest fit you can (and hope you dont bend the underside supports) and leave it.The whole crotch strap not being long enough is true! I ordered my replacement and got it, but I understand there's a considerable backorder on this item.Avoid this seat for its flaws. You'll need a PHD and a year's personal trainer to get a tight fit."
959,1,"Everyone has the diapers they swear by. This work great like the cruisers, but for some reason my daughter tends to get a little red (early stage of rash) when wearing these and we don't get the red with cruisers."
131709,1,"This potty seat is the best portable one we have found. I read some reviews that it is tricky, but I don't think it is that bad at all. Once I got ahang of it, it is the only seat my son will use in public. It is super convenient to put in your bag and he feels safe and comfortable on it because of the size and handles. I really recommend this to anyone."
31540,1,"This drying rack is wonderful. The size of it allows for a lot of items to be drying at the same time. We have several Dr. Brown's bottles, and they have many parts, and we can dry them all, along with out pumping supplies and still have room to spare for pacifiers and other miscellaneous items. There isn't much you can say about a drying rack, but we really love this one."
76977,1,I highly recommend this swing. It's easy to put together and just as beautiful as in the picture!! I love the small mobile that rotates at the top for the baby to watch as she falls asleep. It's easily changed from swinging to rocking motion with one hand. Also love that it can be plugged in so the need for constant replacement batteries isn't necessary.
139427,2,"I bought this night light as a gift to my 3 year-old niece. I assume that all kids are in love with stars and oceans or cute creatures. So i though this twilight turtle would be the best gift since it has gotten so much great reviews as well and it even suggests ""ideal for ages 3 to adult"". However, it was not so much as i expected it to be - not so dreamy and fascinating. Instead, you cannot even see the constellations clearly at all. there was no music and the light is so faint. the piece just looks like a junk in the room. not too impressed."
70642,1,Satisfied Customer Item was as described fast shipper I received item quickly. I would order again if I needed something similar.
176086,1,"The order came with no damage, relatively easy to put together and looks beautiful. We have been told that the wood is soft s be careful not to scratch when putting together. We have not used it yet but seems like it will be jsut fine"
136678,0,"It looked great on the picture and in the store. When we brought it home, and put it on the crib, there was no WOW! as it was in the store. We tried to use it a few times when our baby was just days old, we even kept it till she was a few weeks old, it didn't add anything to her bedtime. It was just useless on the crib, so we returned it."
132338,2,"I like the way it's made, but disappointed that the wipes are about room temperature. A warmer needs to get the wipes almost hot in order to have a nicely warmed wipe by the time it reaches the baby's bottom. I'm sure the manufacturers can fix this issue...If there are smart, they will read these reviews!"
31400,1,"I used this rack when I had my first baby 2 years ago. I liked having a separate rack because it was easy to get to all the bottle parts. It also did not take up a lot of space. It also drains into a little dish so it didn't need to sit right next to the sink. I used it to dry 6-9 oz bottles, nipples, and parts to the Lansinoh breast pump. Once he was done with the bottles, I continued to use it to dry sippy cups. Now I have a second child on the way and will continue to use this rack.Didn't give it a five star because I find that some of the pegs don't fit in tightly. So, sometime they fall off as I am placing something on or off. However, I have not had it fallen off once an item is already on there. Another thing is that you can't spin the bottom section with one hand or you'll move the whole thing. You do have to keep one hand on the base. Not a big deal to me. The top moves fine.Highly recommended."
164358,1,This is the best Baby Dry Diaper for your special little one. Your baby really stays dry and comfortable specially during the night and the fitting is great.
121296,1,The color is very vivid. It looks like the stickers have been painted on the warm. Everything has stayed on the wall so far.
155569,1,"This is a very convenient to use (both for us and for the baby) product. It folds pretty small and it has ""legs"" that allow it to stand if you use it on the ground or if you further spread them they will hold the potty on a standard toilette. You can buy bags that fit into this. They fit very well and keep things nice and clean.the only con is that it's a bit small. I guess that's the price you have to pay for making it portable however it still seems a bit too small sometimes."
3686,1,"My husband is 6'4 and I am 5'3 and we are both able to push the stroller with no problem! I love that I can fold up the stroller and strap it to my back and then just stick it in the trunk of the car. It is so lightweight but it is able to go ever bumps like a pro. I would recommend it for everyday use. I use it at the mall, to the park and just walking downtown. I love it so much!"
48098,1,I bought it for me because I have sensitive skin. It makes my skin smoother and I do not get any skin trouble. At first the aroma scent is pretty strong but it got better several days later.
81195,0,"The pillow cover was slightly small for my product so I have not ultimately used it, however the quality of the pillow cover was fine.The cost of shipping was excessive and it took a bit of time to get to me."
147994,1,"This is great, I bought mine used through craigslist. The woman I bought it from took excellent care of it. Everything works like it should. Braydon loves the gentle vibration and that moving parts at a little over a week old. I expect that he will really enjoy the setting that allows for baby to jiggle the animals to make the music, light, and animal movement start. Wonderful chair, perfect for kitchen and bath tIme for momma to get things done."
182024,1,"I bought this for my Chicco London stroller and it works like a charm. Had to play around with the perfect location for the connectors -for Mommy's cupholder (or water bottle holder) and for baby's snack holder - but once I had it attached, we both couldn't be happier!I wish that they sold the snack holder separately - I keep forgetting to take it off, and after 2 years, it is showing signs of stress at the clip. Won't be long before it snaps, but it really gets bounced around in the back of the minivan, so I think it has held up great. Anything to keep my tot happy!"
152866,0,"The first couple of times we used it, she wanted out after 5 minutes, but my daughter is not even 5 months old. She will sit in it longer now, 15-20 minutes, just enough time to get a little house work done. I heard from many, many different people that walkers don't help a baby develope walking skills as good as the exersaucer's. So while this one will keep her entertained for now, I still plan on buying a exersaucer. Not many toys on this one, but she's figured out how to push on the blue baby dinosaur to make it light up/make music and how to spin the big ball around. Plus it does adjust to 2-3 different heights. My daughter is 24 inches long and on the lowest height she can almost reach the floor. But of course she is younger then the recommended age, so that is to be expected."
116682,0,"I've just fitted 3 of these bolts to our patio doors. They required modification as the bracket designed to hold them on was far too wide for the style of doors I have. I needed to saw the excess bracket off & spray the raw exposed alloy white to match.They work well as locks but it is very easy to lock yourself out as, unless you turn the bolt through 90 degrees, they self-latch shut."
55937,1,"We bought this warmer at Babies are us through amazon a month ago and we love it! We agree that it did take a while to get the right amount of water to heat the bottle. We had great luck with the platex disposable 4 oz bottles after a litle practice and the Dr Browns when putting 6 to 7 ounces works very well! The auto off function is great too! If you don't get this brand, get one they are great!"
96,2,"We got this for on the go use and it doesn't even warm up to the touch. It's a heating pad you wrap around the bottle and how is it supposed to heat a bottle if your hands are warmer than the wrap? It took over 45 minutes to take a cold bottle to even room temp (we used Playtex Ventaires) and by then you might as well have just left it sit at room temp. Useless product. We now take a thermos of heated water and a jar and heat our bottles in the the jar. Cheaper, faster and even more portable. I wish I'd still had the receipt for this thing, I couldn't figure out any use for it so we tossed it. What a waste of money and landfill space :("
77775,2,I too thought that with 2.4GHz this would be a great monitor - WRONG! I cannot believe how much static you hear on the lowest volume! I thought maybe all monitors sounded like this until I started reading reviews. Do not waste your money!
61309,1,"I'm disabled, and use diapers myself. My family, nurses, and aides had tried different diaper pails and they always smelled. I was given a diaper genie after someone who's baby was done with theirs.It has been great! The fact that you have to purchase the refills, is worth the odor-free emptying. The thick material that the stage 2 (older baby) is much thicker than even a trash bag, and has a fresh smell to it.It took me awhile to figure out how to use it, it seems easy but there was a little trick to keep it from coming untwisted.With the genie, first time use,1. remove top and drop in refill.2. pull some of the plastic sheeting up.3. put the plastic ring piece down inside until it sits firm.4. tie a knot in the plastic shetting.5. push the knot into the ring, down to these ""fingers"" that will catch the diaper from going to the bottom.When you have a dirty diaper, you,1. open top latch, with one hand.2. push diaper into opening.3. continue pushing until the ""fingers"" have the diaper wedged in between them. It's impossible for it to untwist if it is caught here. **see below4. once diaper is caught in the ""fingers"", twist the knob on top a couple of times, there is a couple of projections that pick up the sheeting but don't cut it, it twists the sheeting around and causes it to be twisted off, so that the diapers odors are contained fully by the thick sheeting. I found I had to then turn the knob back to get it to let go of the plastic, it would stay in a twist but just take the projectiles out of the sheeting.5. When you put the next diaper in, you repeat steps 2-4.** If you don't get the diaper caught in those ""fingers"", and push it all the way to the bottom, it will come untwisted as it dangles there and then when you go to put the next diaper in, the odors will escape.I hope that helps out for those who have the old diaper genie. I think they've come out with a newer version, I haven't tried it yet, but may if this one gives out.God bless you, Lisa"
21908,1,"My teenager can not stand for her food to touch. This is a great product for her! I was skeptical to purchase the bowl at first, but I am pleased with it."
43472,1,"We purchased this along with the Graco Snugride 35 for our daughter who was born a year ago and it is hard, looking back, to think of another piece of out-and-about baby gear (other than a carrier/sling) as useful as this one. At the basic level, it's great because you can steer it one handed even when it's loaded up and you can access the generously sized storage basket even when the carseat is in place (you'd like to think that this would be true of any stroller or stroller frame; sadly no). You can collapse it one handed, open it one handed, and put it in the trunk with one arm (because it's so light). ""Can I use this one-handed?"" is a great way to screen ANY piece of baby gear.More than that, it has been our go-to piece of gear for the first 11 months of life. It's been our sherpa in the airport, allowing me traveling alone with the baby to easily schlep the diaper bag and carseat from one gate to the next (traveling alone with a 9 month old, I went ahead and bought the baby a seat so I could set her down sometimes. On that note, I had no trouble at all fitting the Snugride 35 into an airplane seat. On another note, there was 1 flight out of 4 where the flight attendant stated that, even though purchasing the seat in the first place was elective, SINCE I'd purchased it using it was now mandatory during taxi, take-off, and landing, ""even if she's screaming."" So I would definitely NOT buy a seat for a baby under 6 months or a baby that could not be distracted for that amount of time or if you wanted to nurse during those times. In our case, she was able to eat baby food -oh ANOTHER FYI, bring re-sealable pouches not jars when traveling and choose the thickest and therefore least drippy/messy purees you can find- during those times and was perfectly happy).Even though she's often in the Baby Bjorn (which, by the way, if you get one, definitely get one with lumbar support. We started off with a regular one and shelved it by the time she was 3 months old whereas the Synergy is still perfectly comfortable. And if you live somewhere at all warm, I would highly recommend white mesh over the solid black or navy fabric. We are now looking into the Beco though because after 6 months it really is nice to be able to hip-carry or back-carry. Besides that, you technically shouldn't forward face in the Baby Bjorn because their legs go numb. But I digress...), so yes, even though she's often in the Baby Bjorn, we'd often bring this thing into the mall to carry our coats and hats, the diaper bag, our coffee (which is safe when the baby isn't in it), our purchases and so on.She used it as a walker wagon in the airport, killing time between connections. Do get the Graco Snugride 35 to go with it. I loved using the shade when she fell asleep in the car (especially when we were moving and driving at night; it blocked the headlights zooming by) and easily moving her sleeping self into the house or out to errands. And in winter, it was nice to easily bring her seat in over night so that it wasn't icy-cold in the mornings. Plus, with a weight limit of 35 pounds, it will help her stay rear-facing for a long time."
8884,1,"I bought a couple of these extensions for the kidco playden I ordered online. The extensions actually weren't necessary for us, because the playden came with 6 sides and ended up being very spacious for my energetic little 10 month old. The kidco play den, without an extension, is also large enough for an adult to sit in, as well.I am very satisfied with the play den (and the extension pieces). I feel very free and confident that baby is safe and secure when she's in there. I like the playden much better than our portacrib for everyday playtime. It's very sturdy, expandable and open & airy. My 10 month old daughter hasn't even thought about climbing out yet, even though I know she would try if she could. The vertical bars don't really seem climb-able for a younger, mobile baby.My husband actually doesn't care for the vertical bars. He refers to the play den as baby's ""jail."" I don't mind the bars, though. Most importantly, baby doesn't mind them, either. She actually has a very nice, panoramic view of the room through those bars. And she likes to use the bars to pull herself up to standing.It's a little difficult to figure out how to change the position of the individual panels. You have to pull up on the panels in a special way. It takes a little time and practice to get the hang of it. I found it almost impossible to get the exact shape that I wanted. I found it easier to just take the unit apart completely and start from scratch.I didn't realize this before I bought it, but you could probably just buy 5 or 6 of the extension pieces and connect them together to assemble your own play den. You just wouldn't have a door, and the door is really nice to have."
178104,1,"I just received this in the mail and opened it quickly to see if it matches my other Cherry furniture for the nursery.Unfortunately, it isn't the exact shade of Cherry. I purchased a Delta Canton 4-in-1 convertible crib (cherry) and the difference is that the color on the crib is like a stained cherry wood, where as the color on this changing table is more of a painted cherry. So it's much darker.I have yet to put it together, so I can't comment on the other things - like is the height good, the entire quality, etc. But from what I see (which is the side part) - it looks to be good quality.I will update this when we've put it together.But all in all, it seems to be a great changing table for $89.98.Happy shopping! And congratulations!"
9476,1,"It seems like I've tried about every potty chair on the market.I had my son pick the color he wanted and in 1 day it was here!After months of resistance, he saw this out of the box and asked to have his diaper taken off.The pee guard is so much better on this seat. It keeps the pee in the bowl AND doesn't crush my son's privates.Hooray for BabyBjorn!"
80914,2,"I should have listened to the other poor reviews before buying this but I really liked the idea of the pillows on the side because my little guy is on the smaller side and I thought they would help prop him up better. The cover itself is too small to fit on carts. I know some people said that they didn't have any trouble with Target carts, but maybe the carts are different sizes because it did not fit. If I were to cover the handles, I would have had to stretch it so far that the holes where his legs would go through would be like 4 inches above the carts' holes. So, it doesn't cover the handle, the velcro is so loud and kind of difficult to undo and if you position the cover to fit where the leg holes fit properly, the pocket in the back flop over and slide down where his back should be. This cover also does not fit in highchairs. I tried and had to take the ridiculously large pillows out just to make it fit. When you roll it up (which is very difficult to do), it feels as if you are carrying a sleeping bag!!I tried it. I hated it. I'm sending it back. Great idea, but poor design. They need to make it bigger (which would make it really feel like a sleeping bag!) and have a small tie for you to secure the pocket to the back."
182402,1,"My 2-month old baby had cradle cap around her ears, nose, eyebrows, forehead, and eyelids for days. Or at least it looked like cradle cap. It looked like very thick, flaky dry skin. It first appeared on her scalp. A day later, it was all around her ears, sides of her nose, eyebrows, forehead, and eyelids.After some research on remedies, one mom on a message board recommended Aquaphor. We remembered getting a tiny little sample tube of Aquaphor from the hospital when our baby was born. So we tried it. The result is beyond amazing! The thick flaky dry skin around her ears, forehead, & nose, where we applied Aquaphor has cleared in just one day. We applied it once in the morning, then reapplied around noon, and reapplied it again at night after her bath and before putting her to bed. We will try to put a thin layer on her eyebrows & lids now that we know it works great! As for the scalp, we are trying a special shampoo for it.Needless to say, we bought a larger tube of Aquaphor!"
175312,1,"I bought this rug for my son's room. It is a great looking rug; I only wish it were a bit bigger. However, his room is small so it is fine. The only problem I've had is that it came rolled up (which I expected), but I can't seem to get one side to lay flat."
24481,0,"This is a great gate, but if you put it a doorway that has a door, you can't close the door all the way."
42517,0,"I ordered this product to carry my fussy newborn around in the house, since she likes to be held by me all of the time. The product was very long, as described by other reviewers, so I would definitely suggest that you wrap it at home to avoid dragging it on the ground or other unclean areas. While it was not hard to learn how to use (I got it easily after following the instructions once), the length makes it take what seems like a few mintues to set it up and prepare for baby. So if you wanted to say, scoop your little one up quickly because the doorbell rang, this would take too long. Also, my daughter did not really like it so much, I think because she did not like being restricted from movement. However, she was fine in the suggested newborn position when I took her outside (with my maternity coat on over her).Overall, I like this product, because I use it mostly for outside travel. It has a nice snug fit, can be used by my husband as well, and will grow with my baby, for longterm use. For indoor use, I purchased a Hotslings, which is much easier to slip on and off (but doesn't seem as sturdy to carry my infant on New York City bus and subway trips)."
87726,1,"My daughter used the Gymini Activity Gym starting around three months old and came to have hours of enjoyment from it. In the beginning, she would simply look at the hanging objects but soon she was swating, pulling, and kicking different objects around. The black, white, and red design made it easy for her to see the objects. We used it until she was about 7 months old and was confidently sitting on her own. It's still in excellent condition so we have put it away so when we have another baby, he or she can enjoy it too."
36322,1,"Great for a little bag to carry in with you, while leaving the bigger one in the car. Very convenient."
110153,1,"Just ordered 2 of these one-piece breastshields so I could have extras when I return to work. I love that they are one piece unlike the ""puzzle-pieces"" that come with the P.I.S. So much easier to clean. Plus the suction is far greater with the one piece and the price is great. Items arrived in 4 days from the shipper instead of the 2-day ""amazon norm"""
56104,2,"This gate does not come with the hardware necessary for installing in drywall. It was also extremely difficult to line up and install correctly. The directions have no pictures (besides the pictures of the parts, labeled at the back). If I installed it again I would still have the same problems (ie. It's not that I just didn't 'get it' the first time)."
26222,0,"We have used this travel bag on five airplane trips. It is cumbersome while you are trying to manage luggage and/or a baby in a stroller. The hook for the strap has come off while we have been carrying the car seat numerous times. I have tried dragging it behind me while pulling luggage with my other than and that doesn't even work because the strap isn't long enough (and I'm only 5'2""). I have seem parents have an easier time with just a strap around the car seat and the car seat over their backs. Also, it got a 4"" tear the first or second time we used it. I do think it would fit nearly all car seats. We have used it with our Graco Snugride w/base and now with the Evenflo Triumph. Also, there is a good amount of room to store diapers and blankets."
158740,1,"I don't think I ever used a single footed sleeper that I got for my baby shower (and I received dozens of them) because this had me hooked. So easy to get into to change a diaper, so cuddly soft for baby, and so safe for them to sleep in. I donated all the footed sleepers recently because I will only use the Halo sleep sack with any future children we have."
152432,1,"I was hesitant to try Huggies becasue I usually use Pampers Cruisers but for some reason, Amazon takes forever delivering them.Anyway, the Huggies absorbtion is terrific. The problem I have is with the flexibility. The diaper seems stiff and the tabs don't stretch like Pampers."
29301,1,"What a great little step stool this is! Just the perfect size...nothing fancy, just 100% functional, well designed and made. It is much more compact than others out there, yet 100% safe for children to adults to use. We keep it on hand for our four little grandchildren to use at the bathroom sink or kitchen counter. I've tried others in the past...and this one is simply the best. A classic."
51297,1,Within just my first month of pregnancy I started having back pain and could not sleep. I was waking up around 2to3 in the morning and by the time I get back to sleep it was time to get up. I felt so horrible for the rest of the day not to mention I was also keeping my husband awake. Some say that the price is high but a good night's sleep is extremely important to your health and to the baby's health....so I would say that I would have paid double the price. Also when I make up the bed i just place the pillow at the end of the bed. I'm very pleased with this product.
137002,1,"I bought two of these Tadpoles classic Gingham coverlets one pink and one yellow , I like them very much . I washed them together with another cotton coverlet different brand that I have , they washed , came out of the washer and dryer without any lint . (Be sure to wash the coverlets only with other cotton blankets or coverlets or comforters this will keep the Tadpoles classic Gingham coverlets lint free and like new all times ). These coverlets are so soft and cuddly after wash and dried . I'm going to buy a couple more .Tadpoles Classics Gingham Crib Coverlet, Yellow"
10019,1,"I just got done potty training my boy/girl twins using the small potty chairs that sit on the floor but we are planning a vacation in a few weeks and they were terrified of using the big potty but we really had to get them using one. I bought a cheap-o potty seat and it slid around all over the place and they were scared to use it so we went back and paid twice as much and got the Bjorn and so glad we did. We have a TOTO brand toilet and the seat is very deep and contoured so the lock on the Bjorn didn't work at all on our toilet seat, but because it also has a grippy bottom and is quite large, it fits great anyway. My toddlers were fine using it and began using the big potty the same day we bought it. Definately worth the extra money, great design!"
122546,0,"I love Combi strollers, but actually went with a Graco after trying out a bunch of strollers (we had a Combi, then got rid of it).Combi has great strollers, but if you need basket room, forget it. There is NONE. I can't even fit my SMALL diaper bag in it.That being said, these are INCREDIBLY lightweight, SUPEREASY to fold down, and really don't take up much space. If you just need a lightweight umbrella type, Combi is THE WAY to go!!"
55859,0,"The instructions for how much water to use are confusing. When the bottle is done warming, the light just turns off. An audible notification would be great, especially considering you may be tending to baby in another room while the bottle is warming. Also, it has damaged to bottom of my similar bottles, crazing the plastic. If would not buy again, look for something better."
181312,1,"Our baby LOVES this, and has since she was 6 weeks old (5 months now). We use it at least three times a day and just replaced the batteries for the first time last week.It is the only thing our little one will do on her own for more than two minutes and it has allowed me to take a shower, do the dishes, and just take a break once in a while. I'm still not sick of the music which is on in our house at least 30 minutes a day. The songs are classic kid songs but jazzed up a bit.Now that she's rolling, she can get to all her favorite toys.We added a lot of new hanging toys which capture her interest and fill out the play mat, but her two favorites are still the monkey and the toucan,Definitely a must have in any house with a baby!!"
10055,0,"We got it due to all of the amazing reviews and assumed it would fit on what we thought was a normal size toilet. We rent a duplex and the bathroom is a little small for a normal home but is the usual size for any type of renting. I don't think this toilet or the last 4, from previous apartments, is any different in size and even with the adjustments this trainer will not fit.It's too oval shaped and goes right up the back of the toilet seat making it a very awkward and barely usable fit. Be careful if you think your toilet is a little small or of a more rounded than oval shape."
17542,1,"I had to post a review for this highchair. It is absolutely wonderful. We love it. We always thought we'd buy the Peg Perego high-chair because my sister-in-law has one and she did much research and always seems to pick ""the best."" However, we tried all of the high chairs out, just to be fair. I honestly have to say, this high chair does everything her expensive one does and a few things her doesn't. The entire padding slips off and is machine washable. There is separate padding underneath the quilted padding that also is very easy to remove. THere aren't a lot of cracks or folds for food to hide, which is a plus. THe wheels and locks are great. It folds up so compact too. Much more compact than any other stroller I've seen on the market. It can also be used as a youth chair and raised or lowered to table level. The seat also reclines 3 levels. I really have nothing bad to say! Finally there is a great product with a great price!!"
120507,1,"My daughter stayed in my bedroom until she was about 4 months and then moved into her own room. She could've moved into her own room sooner, but my husband and I weren't ready. This monitor helped to ease our worries of her being in another room. We just wish the pad was longer in length. About 4:30am this morning the alarm sounded. My husband and I about broke our necks trying to get to her. She was fine...she had just scooted herself down to the bottom of the mattress (which the pad does not reach that far down) and off the monitor pad. Even though it took my husband and I about a hour to calm ourselves down, we felt good knowing that the monitor pad really does work. We have not experienced any problems with this monitor what so ever. It is one of the more expensive monitors but well worth every penny. In my opinion, this is a MUST have item for everyone's nursery."
168628,0,"I bought Pampers for my daughter as this was the brand used in the hospital. However, I didn't really care for the mesh in it, as it leaves a mark on the baby's deliquet skin. Huggies had send me a coupon, so I figured I will give it a try when I was upgrading to size 3. First I got a smaller pack from the store. I got the Huggies movers. Its price is the same as Pampers swaddler. I prefer Huggies, so now I have switched. This is b/c 1) no mesh, so no marking on the baby's skin 2) the surface stays dry even if the diaper is heavy with urine.I will not buy Pampers again."
18043,0,This was a FABULOUS toy until my baby learned to roll over..then he totally lost interest. There's nothing on it to keep him amused if he doesn't want to lay on his back. Must be a good idea for babies less than 4 months.
130950,1,"This portable bouncy seat is great. It folds up so easily and in a convenient carrying case to bring with you anywhere. So far, I've mainly just used it around the house. It also has a pretty good vibration for being so small. We have a 4 week old and use it almost daily."
58264,1,Love this car seat cover!! I thought it was kind of crazy to get a cover like this for $40 when there are nice ones for $25 but someone gave it to me as a gift and it really is great. My baby doesn't overheat. I can put her in her seat without a big jacket on which normally might be too bulky for the seatbelt to fit right. She always looks so cozy!! It's definitely something you can use for multiple kids if you don't buy something like pink...I think it's worth it! Treat yourself! :)
178372,0,"We got the baby Bjorn as a shower gift, and were able to use it for only a short while. It worked well from about 1 month to 4 months, but after that the my daughters weight was not distributed well, and gave me terrible backaches after only a about an hour of using it. We recently purchased an Ergo baby carrier and are much happier."
128231,1,These bottles are BPA free and fit the Avent bottle nipples so we were able to move our girls over with out causing any problems. The lids fit on wierdly though so you need to make sure you have them on the correct grooves or your baby will be covered in milk!
127302,1,"This crib is really nice. It was so convenient to have it shipped to me. I looked in Babysrus and of course they didnt have many types of cribs in stock and would have to order it to the store from a catalog so I figured might as well order it online from amazon. I'm so happy I chose the DaVinci Kalani. Its sturdy and thick wood. I havent tried converting it yet though, not sure if i will. I might just get a regular toddler bed but its nice to have this option."
103172,2,My nine month old just pulled three plugs out through the large opening in the top of the cover. I plugged them bag in without opening it - as another reviewer remarked it it easy for a baby to stick their hands in.
71375,1,"This toy is great. We were looking for something our daughter could kick, she was not into using her hands yet. the soft ball that the baby kicks is great. ive looked at other toys that all had hard things they kick. even though she is still to young to sit on her own, we put her in the bumbo and sit her infont of the gym so she can push the nose (which lights up) and pull on the hanging toys. the sound has 2 volumes, so you dont have to have it too loud. and there are two options on it, either to just play music and laugh, or react to baby pushing or pulling. the noise the bear makes is silly. the music it plays is not that bad as some of the baby toys. over all i think this was a great buy.the only downside is, it does not fold up to put away. it only gets a little smaller when the bear head is pushed down and its in sit up mode. but to me its worth just sitting it aside."
8550,0,"This product did save a lot of headaches for my twin boys for the first eighteen months of their life. But at the age of 18 mos. they could pull it off and chew on it. At that point I decided to remove it but to my dismay the double sided tape is horrible to get off. It took me a week of trying everything and using a TON of elbow grease to get it off. I now have blisters on my fingers from trying to rub it off. Even though I got most of it off, it did leave places on my coffee table. This will now be the table we leave in our family room for our kids to play on and if it gets ruined then it won't matter."
90803,2,"Hey guys.I love that these diapers are thin to start with and also holds a lot however I will not purchase again after these 2 boxes I recently ordered are finished. Here's why:Although these diapers are thin & sits high on waist ( so the strap doesn't rub against sons thigh and cause bruising..as occurred with the huggies brand) The BIGGEST fallback is that it is made up of silicone particles ( the absorbent) in the diaper itself and when wet, if child runs around ( like my VERY active toddler) then the diaper tears and the silicoe particles fall out the side.Today was the 5th time this has happened in the space of 2 weeks. I DO change his diapers frequently and now I do it even more than I did with the huggies in fear that the silicone will fall out and give him a rash or dirty the floor. It is a mess to clean up, there's silicone 'powder' everywhere.Tonight I've pretty much had it with these diapers. My son (19months) was running around kicking his ball and when it was time to change him, there was a big glob of silicone at the foot of his pants. Luckily he was wearing his thermal pants so the elastic band was very close fitting to his ankles and this is what kept the majority, not all, of the silicone within his pants and off the carpet.In summary. These diapers and thin and does not leak BUT these 2 factors do not make up for the huge downfall of having silicone particles all over the place. Thank God he has not gotten a rash from it as yet.I do not recommend this specific type (Baby dry) of pampers because I have not tried the other types from Pampers."
65530,1,"Very convenient carseat, can be placed in the combi double stroller, which is the only side by side stroller that I have seen that you can attach an infant seat into. (and I've searched a lot) The carseat is comprable to the Peg Perego Primo Viaggo (whichI also have) but you can;t connect that one into the Aria twin, the peg perego side by side.The seat itself is lightweight and easy to manage, and VERY soft with the foam insert. It's easy to get into the car with or without the base. Only complaint would be that the straps could be a little longer because you can't have both a baby bunting bag and the foam insert otherwise the straps aren't long enough to comfortably get the baby in and out.Also, our daughter was extremely colicky from 5 weeks to 12 weeks and would only sleep in this carseat, so it must be pretty comfortable!"
53986,2,"I got this thinking it would be great. I thought I would be able to keep an eye on my baby and not be a road hazzard. I kept it for a week or so then took it back. I was not able to get the mirror to sit right in my car. I have a mid-size sedan and there was no headreast to attach it to. I had to use the LATCH system andit didn't get the job done. I was really disappointed because I really wanted it to work. After thinking about it I figure if there is something that wrong with my baby I will know it without the mirror. By having the mirror I will only be staring in it concerned about my baby and not watching the road therefore actually becoming a road hazzard because I have the mirror. I love the idea, but it is not for me."
128912,2,"Just wanted to inform all parents out there that this product contains BPA/ Bisphenol A. I returned mine. Pacifiers,bottles,breast pumps can have BPA in them as well such as the AVENT products that I returned. I then decided to go with Born Free bottles and sterilizer,Soothie pacifier and the Gerber Nuk pacifiers,and Medela pump. All their products are BPA Free. You do the research and decide if you will buy or continue to use their products. I've already written the President, my senators, and Oprah. Hopefully together we can keep our children safe."
163071,2,"The pail is so light that it moves around when you try to step on the pedal. Even when it is right up against the wall, you have to push the base of the pail back to the wall (so the bottom isn't flat on the floor) just to be able to press the pedal down, and then the lid still doesn't open far enough to toss in diapers/wipes. Further, the design of the snap-on lid makes it virtually impossible to use a diaper pail liner any thicker than a regular trash bag. I would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone; in fact, I'm going to get a small kitchen garbage can to use instead."
146245,1,"I have a very active little boy and he gets bored so easily. Now I heard so much about how bad jumpers are because they can delay walking ( the kids can't see their feet) and they supposedly can also put too much pressure on the hips of the kid. I really tried to resist them, but my boy is at a phase were he gets really mad if he can't move and it frustrates us and him as well. After reading all the great reviews and many talks with my husband about it we decided to get him one. I felt like a kid bying a bottle of booze - Since it's so un PC to get it. ( even my neighbors won't see the box in the trash, I think I have to sneak it out - in a I killed someone and hide him in the carpet kinda way lol).The other reason I broke down and purchased my little guy's dream toy was because I believe that it's a fun toy but you have to use it in moderation. If you're looking for something to keep your kid in while you take a five hour bubble bath - don't do it.And that's what we decided to do, only leave him in that thing for just a good 10 - 20 min each day. And let me tell you those 20 minutes are probably the highlight of my sons day. He loves to bounce and too look at all the cool crazy things that are attached to it. I also installed the jumperoo all by myself ( and oh yeah I'm usually the one who cries and gets a meltdown when I just come near an ikea furniture - that's how bad I am in building things). But this baby was an easy birth!I know I will have to get used to the fact that he is sitting in a jumping toilet seat but hey if they made one in my size I would probably be in it until it 24/7. Btw. I read a lot about the size issues - my baby is 6 months old and pretty long and he barely can touch the ground to hop around - it's perfect so I would not recommend to get one before your kid hits the no. 3 diapers :)."
102040,1,"The first time I used it the bottle was too hot, so I used less water for the second bottle and it was perfect. Now I can 'eyeball' the amount of water depending on the amount of formula to the bottle and how cold the bottle was to begin with. I've only used it for two days and I use 8 oz size bottles with 5 1/2 oz formula. The more the bottle is close to room temperature, the less water I have to use. Some times I warm the bottle before the baby is crying to eat and then I just leave it in the warmer after it warms. It'll keep it at the correct temperature for several minutes while I change his diaper. I LOVE it!!"
66108,1,I was given one pack of these bottles at a gift at my shower. They looked really confusing to me but thought I would give them a try. My baby almost never had gas. They cut the air right out of the bottle and he loved the shape of the nipple. These are a must have especially with a colic or fussy baby!!
150700,0,"i got 2 of these for my girls(one each) the first one...took me about 2 hours to put togeather useing a multi-tool......and well...lets just say dont do it that way.(im goning to ""re-screw"" all of them tonight) the second one i used an electric screw driver that we got so we could anchor the dresser to the wall corectly....NOT THRILLED with the anchor kit they come with, just something about a zip strip holding a 70lbs dresser(shipping weight). anyway it took about 30 minutes to do the second one with it, and it seems much more sturdy. the instructions wheren't hard to follow, dint evan need them for the second one. some of the holes had not been drilled corectly, but you can usaly expect that with this typ of furniture. other than that they are nice looking peices and the drawers move smothly all and all good for the priceupdate 11-5-11 ok the second one we got is rock solid however the first one(the white one) is absolut crap. the scond one(cherrie) has never needed ""adjusting"" as the white on is constantly falling apart, it has got so bad that we bought 2 new dressers off one of my hubbies coworkers(500 grand total) and a twin bed for her, or guests, since she still fits the toddler bed we got her last yearupdate 6-12-12 my oldest has finnaly succeded in disloging one of the doors on the second dresser(cherry), much to my dissapontment. as she has compleatly broken the bottom drawer on the first one(white), wich is going out to the curb in a few days."
63626,1,"It's great for my little guy on our shopping trips. He even likes ""talking"" to the colorful characters on the cover. I keep this in the back of the van so I always have it and can use it whenever I need to."
88869,2,"I signed up for these with the subscription purchase because they were slightly cheaper than the Huggies. We are not happy with them at all. They don't seem to hold as much, which is a problem for overnight. You also have to be careful how you position them on your child so they don't leak. When I used swaddlers for my son as an infant, I thought this was a great brand, but the Baby Dry are definitely NOT of the same quality. We will continute to use these during the day until they are gone, but I will not by them again."
108725,1,I was given this as a gift for my baby shower. We took our daughters footprint the day she came home from the hospital to cherish that day always. Then we put the picture of her that the hospital takes. This is the most cherished gift we have ever recieved!
44056,2,"This looks neat, but is easily pulled off by baby. Like, within 15 seconds of putting him in the tub. Put it back on, he pulls it off again. It's a game! A game that makes tub time more dangerous since he's standing to pull the thing off every time it's put back on. Maybe if my kid was six years old it would be useful for rinsing shampoo, but in that case I wouldn't need a flow deflector to accomplish that anyway."
139914,2,"I purchased 2 of these gates to close off the entrances to my son's playroom. Both were broken when I received them. My husband helped me fix them, but I believe the price is too steep to pay for broken merchandise. They look great, but I was more than a little disappointed in the quality."
122587,2,"I purchased this stroller for a trip and to keep in my vehicle instead of our full size. It is the worst stroller I could have spent this much money on. You cannot steer it with one hand, it handles horribly and its already starting to break (the plastic handles). I broke down and bought a maclaren triumph and love it. I found it on at an popular online auction website for the same price as I paid for this combi!!! Don't waste your money and patience on this piece of junk."
119306,0,"This item seems okay... I also have the Balboa Pillow, in comparison the material on the Brest Friend Pillow is very scratchy & for this reason can't bring myself to use it. Also not good if you've had a c-section or for nursing in the football hold."
142482,0,"Great product, however, it definitely took an hour + to assemble. The rails will not hideaway on the type of bed frame we have for our daughter. Lastly, making the bed is pretty difficult, there is not enough room on the sides to lay the comforter down so we have to kind of tuck it under."
33468,1,"As a stationary gate that we leave in place, this is an excellent value and a tight fit. Just work with it until you figure it out. It does take a few minutes... Great value!"
9716,1,"My son loves this potty. After some introduction time, he is excited to use it and usually stays seated (he is 19 mo) We have been doing light potty training since he was 12 mo old, and started with a crappy but simple potty from Target. The old one often pinched him and sometimes he was able to poop on the back of the bowl, but not with this potty. It's sturdy, seals nicely and easy to clean. Wish I would have found this one first!"
62530,2,These are a great idea but didn't work for me. Our cords are thick and long and wouldn't fit inside the box.
62573,2,"The Diaper Genie does do what it claims. It helps keep the odors in and looks much better than an overflowing trash can. I originally bought it thinking that it would do a better job of keeping odor trapped than diaper pails that did not use the twist and tie system and just used ordinary trash bags. But just to compare, I also bought a Diaper Champ....MUCH better. It did just as good of a job with the odor, was much easier to use, and I can use ordinary kitchen trash bags instead of expensive diaper genie refills. I got rid of the diaper genie and bought 2 diaper champs instead."
140674,1,Works great! I have been using it for about a month ( 8 months pregnant) and I can truly see a difference in my skin--softer and smoother. I wish I bought it earlier in my pregnancy--keeps the skin moisturized for a long time. My husband doesnt love the smell though--but he loves how my skin feels!!
85310,1,"I have dogs that sleep in my bed and right up against me, I cannot turn, move or get up during the night. With this pillow, I sleep very comfortably in the middle, the dogs are outside the pillow, we are all happy sleepers now."
141053,1,I have made all my little mans food since he has started solids. This grinder should not be used to make large batches it is a handy tool to take out to dinner so my son can have some of whatever i am eating. He is almost one and is just starting to get his first tooth so we still use this grinder frequently. I have not had any problems using it. I went out for steak and it ground up just fine. i used it on pork chops no problem. i don't understand why other reviewers are having so many problems with this item.
144075,1,The Svan High Chair was very easy to put together. We added the cushion for comfort. The chair is very stable and look great using it with our kitchen chairs. Our 4 year old grandson can get on and off with no problem at all.
169222,1,Would recommend .. Diaper has never leaked like others have.. And you know when the baby needs changing because of the green line on the diaper!
164987,1,"Looking everywhere, these are the best deals, price/diaper. No real issues with leaks (no more than other brands). I have had a few when I go to pull the Velcro, it breaks off. It's happened to about 3-4 diapers. Called customer service and they were great"
24446,1,"So far so good my two year olds can't get it open. They love to slam it though, and we have had a bit of a problem with closing it since they have been so rough on it. Overall we love it. It is much easier to navigate then our last gate (especially since it goes into the kitchen and I usually have my hands full when I am trying to go through it). We have an old house that probably doesn't have an even doorway and this gate can be adjusted to accommodate that. I would recommend it to a friend."
170007,1,"The crib arrived in perfect condition, even though we moved after it was ordered and it had to be re-mailed. The crib is beautiful, it looks exactly as pictured, I couldn't go on about how great it looks as others already have, but I agree.So why write this review? I'm not sure if anyone pointed out the holes in the crib. Not literally holes that shouldn't be there but where the screws go in, there is a wide hole left where you can see the screws and it kind of takes away from the appearance of the crib. (Check out the picture)Otherwise it is a great crib and I plan on keeping it and using it as a regular sized bed frame when my baby gets to that point."
79743,0,"After alot of reviewing we bought this camera system due to the features,consumer rating, and price point (on sale sealed the deal). Received the monitor and quickly found out the monitor is defective. Had two options return the whole unit to Amazon for a refund or call the customer service to see if there was another resolution. *Note: the user's manual is not that well thought out, just the basics to get you through a normal setup.Customer service didn't even question my abilities to follow simple instruction, which is not the case with most companies (I get frustrated when a CS rep has me ensure I remembered to plug the unit in or turn it on). They took my information and are sending out a pre-paid return label for a full refund. This was not my first choice to remediate the situation but it is a very satifying feel to not have to deal with the constant e-mail or calling to ensure the product will be taken care of. In addition, they are refunding me full price of the monitor so I will not be out the shipping charges (rare these days).Although it did not work out the customer service has definitely ensured that I will be looking to there product line in the future."
43007,1,Daughter loves the Moby wrap baby carrier because it is more flexible and changeable than other products.Her baby out grew the other brand at 7 months.
87848,1,"I look for toys that are versatile, fun, encourage exploration and creativity. I look for toys that do more than just let the child push a button. This toy fits most of my expectations in a toy.I particularly like how you can contact tinylove for replacements- if the music stops playing, contact them and they will replace the flower at no cost to you. Very nice.This washes well, folds up easily and is as versatile as you make it. You can switch toys around and put other toys up on the hooks. I like that. It is easy to take places because it folds up- the blanket part on the bottom makes it fun to take to the park.My only comment would be that you can get other toys that hang over the baby for a little bit less money. However, you do not get the quality assurance, replacement parts, and versatility that you do with this one."
84446,1,"It's sturdy and I have it hanged on the doorway push up bar which is highly recomended, no screws or racks are needed."
177316,0,"I bought this pump after reading all the rave reviews. I wanted a pump for very limited, occasional use, that was compatible with all the AVENT bottles I already had, and that was not too expensive since after all, I wasn't sure if I'd even be successful at breastfeeding. THIS WAS A MISTAKE! True - the pump does work when your supply is fully in. It is also quite comfortable, and discrete. However, it is hand operated, obviously, and this means that it will take much more time and effort to pump a bottle than with the electric. Time and effort are in short supply with a newborn. Frankly, when you breastfeed you spend enough time strapped to the couch with the baby that a pump needs to be comfortable, quick, and easy. Breastfeeding has enough challenges, pumping need not be another. Bottom line - if you want to breastfeed successfully, you absolutely need an electric pump (recommend Medella). My advice is to rent one from the hospital for a week while you give breastfeeding a try (or just hold off on buying one right away), and if you decide you want to continue nursing after a week or two, then invest in the $200 Medela electric pump. (Purchase online through somewhere like momsmaternity.com for much less than at this, and most, stores.) Spending $50 on a manual pump is honestly a waste of money. I can't tell you how many of my nursing friends tried to warn me about this, and I didn't want to accept that I'd really need a $200 electric pump. I just didn't think I was a ""gung ho"" nurser, and after all, isn't that what those pumps are for? Well, I have now been nursing successfully for 5 weeks. It has had many challenges, but I do believe it is worth it. However, an electric pump is essential for (1) relieving engorgement, (2) making a bottle so someone else can feed your baby while you're away (even just to go get your hair done, or go run errands - away doesn't necessarily mean on an extended business trip), and (3) building up a supply of frozen breastmilk for unexpected absences (believe me they happen). Happy nursing, and don't waste the $50."
94960,2,"We bought several of these for our 23 month old twin boys. Saw some frustration, but we had also recently given up the bottle. My husband and I both tried these cups and got nothing out of them. We tried loosening the lids, refrigerated, unrefrigerated, milk, water. Each time it was very difficult to get a drink. I'm going back to my tried and true Playtex that we used with two older children. It was nice to see this new-to-us product and not have to mess with valves and making sure they are clean of any residue. We've also tried Nuby soft tip and Nuby hard tip (with a two sided valve) and still lean toward Playtex."

65781,2,"These sound wonderful, don't they?? To save a step in the pumping process would be WONDERFUL. However, these are not a time saver and, in fact, may really waste time and energy. Here's why:1. When pumping, the bags are fine. However, I occasionally have to stop and help baby in the middle of a pumping session. Can't do that with these - the bags cannot be set down with the flange on them.2. When I'm done pumping, it is difficult to juggle two unstable bags with the flange mechanisms on top while turning off the pump, disconnecting cords, trying to put a breast pad in place and pull a bra up, etc.3. Pulling the connector out of the bag while holding two of these is extremely awkward and may result in some spillage because you can't set them down - see #1 above.4. The zipper part of these bags is deceiving. I thought I had a bag securely zipped, but when I double checked it popped right open. Glad I checked, but what a pain to do every time...and I worry that it still isn't completely zipped even when it is.5. Lastly, there is also the price. These bags retail for double what the Lansinoh bags cost, but they really cost MORE. Think about it, when you buy 50 Lansinoh bags, you use one each time you pump. Not so with these. You have to put one on each breast, unless you pump one at a time. And, since you are considering buying these to save time, I'm guessing you don't have time to pump that way. Me either.In a nutshell, these stink. It's not an execution or design flaw, though there are some of those as well. It's really just one of those things that sounds great, but can't be done effectively.I'm sticking with my Medela bottles and transferring the milk to the Lansinoh bags. WAY easier."
179281,0,"My daughter (5 months old) has been exclusively breastfed since she was born because we've been unable to find a bottle that she likes-we tried Dr. Brown, evenflo, Gerber NUK, pretty much every kind we could find, and still no luck. I thought we'd give these a try since we've tried everything else-because the nipples are thin and long, she doesn't really like them. When she did take it (after a lot of wrestling)I noticed they have the air reducer (attached to the bottom) that keeps her from getting gassy and helps keep the liquid in the bottle flowing smoothly without bubbling. They come apart easily (into 4 pieces: nipple, bottle, bottom air vent, bottom ring to hold the air vent on) and are a lot easier to clean than some of the other types of bottles we've had that have a lot of smaller pieces. This set comes with 3 bottles and 3 fast flow nipples, so I wouldn't recommend using them for newborn because the milk comes out VERY quickly and would be difficult for them to keep up. Overall, I wouldn't recommend them for a picky breastfed baby because the nipple isn't close enough to the ""real thing"", but for a non-picky baby, they'd be great!"
20380,2,"The scissors are not a toy, and I was asked to review them as a toy. Hence, my rating may be of no value. I was a bit disappointed as they don't work very well to trim an infants nails."
26261,1,In response to the message about the Britax Marathon seat - YES!! It does fit into this bag. I tried it with my seat and it works with room to spare!
53487,1,We got this for our nine month old son and he loves to feel like he's eating with the family. Does the job great and is easy to move around and clean.
50130,0,"hard to put together, ok quality.. I suppose better than many..but still just average quality"
129426,0,"This is a cute toy- it is very similar to the 0-ball rattle in that a young baby can grasp it easily as soon as they are physically able. however, like the o-ball rattle my son is no longer interested in this toy. It was useful for maybe only a few months. If you're looking for toys that will keep babies interest as they grow this isn't it."
124499,0,"Well, I rec. this lamp as a shower present and though it matches our bedding and is very cute, I am not entirely pleased. The lamp part seems fine, sturdy enough and plenty of light, I like the lamp or nightlight feature. However, I am not crazy about the lampshade. Very flimsy. As I was removing it from the box, I realize it is paper and it bends as I am trying to place it on the lamp. The shade now has several creases in it. Though I do like the lamp, I think the shade may have to be replaced before long."
89528,2,"My oldest usually does good with her cruisers so I figured why not when i bought these for my youngest! Every 30 minutes she'd be soaked and on top of that, everytime she pooped she had blowouts ruining about 5 of her sleepers. I do not blame Amazon for this, but NEVER in my life will I buy babydry again!"
65709,1,This mobile is great! The music is nice and the projections on the ceiling are awesome. Even my 3 year old likes to watch it. The only negative about it is that its very sensitive to other remotes. Whenever we turn the channel on our tv it turns the mobile on/off. Doesn't take long for that to get old.
26894,1,"I was so uncomfortable my 3rd pregnancy.... This was the best thing I purchased for my time being pregnant. It took so much weight off of me it felt like. I didn't gain a lot of weight, But this just made everything better. Highly recommend this to every pregnant woman."
164534,1,"I am one to never believe claims on a box like ""12 hour dryness"", but for these diapers - that is the truth. At least for overnight use. I have kept my son in these overnight and have had very good success. He wakes up dry and the diaper is completely saturated. Quite impressive.We switched to these from Swaddlers and have not noticed any difference in terms of leakage. I have had few leaks from these diapers and most times I think it is due to operator error and me not closing the tabs properly. As others have mentioned, the diapers are thin and easy to store. They are also easy to open and the tabs stay firmly in place. I have never ripped a tab on a Pampers diaper as I have with Huggies and Luvs diapers. Definitely recommend picking up a small pack if you are skeptical. They also seem to be a bit cheaper than swaddlers making them a better economic choice."
119424,1,"After struggling with breastfeeding for several days, I visited a lactation consultant who popped a My Brest Friend around my waist. I was instantly in love. I had been using a Boppy pillow, and hadn't even realized how difficult it was to use - too soft, and it was constantly slipping off my waist and forcing me to readjust while simultaneously cradling my newborn (who often needs to be held with two hands to stay latched).The biggest advantages of the My Brest Friend are that it is firm and almost completely flat (with two short ""humps"" to support baby's head). This allows me to maintain proper arm position throughout a feeding. The Boppy was too soft and my arms would sink into the pillow, which seems counterintuitive, since the point of a breastfeeding pillow is to elevate and support your arms while nursing. I felt like I was still having to lift my baby during a feed, whereas the My Brest Friend does that work for me, sparing my arms, neck and upper back.Another advantage is the waist strap, which the Boppy doesn't have. This allows the pillow to remain steady throughout the feeding, no readjustments necessary (especially good if you have a squirmy baby or one who likes to delatch constantly, like I do). I just put the pillow around my waist, buckle the strap and I'd be good to go for an entire day if I needed to! This also means that you can wear it around the house as much as you want, and always be ready to feed your baby without having to leave the room to find the pillow. (Of course, this depends on your tolerance for wearing a pillow around your waist, but I find it convenient at times.)I also like the little pocket - very convenient for storing small things that you might need during a feeding. I keep a lip balm, the baby's Vitamin D drops and a few other things in there.I still use my Boppy - my baby likes to hang out in it, and I'm sure it'll come in handy for ""tummy time"" later on, but for breastfeeding, My Brest Friend is the way to go. It's not as attractive as the Boppy (especially when you take the cover off - I was surprised to see that it was just a naked piece of foam, which means that you HAVE to keep a cover on at all times, so make sure you get an extra), and the name is silly, but it's by far the more practical product. It's saved my sanity in these first few weeks, and my baby and I are much happier for having discovered it!"
104881,0,"I bought this particular toddler bed based on the fact that the picture of the product didn't have an additional leg in the middle of the bed. I know I would stub my toe a million times on a bed that had one. Sadly, when the bed arrived, it has an additional leg in the middle! WHY DOES IT NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE!!!! I feel ripped off."
17620,1,"I bought this stroller for my 2 year old. I have big kids and needed something that would last awhile with their height and weight. This stroller is awesome. It is strong and durable, but also light and compact. I have used it alot since I purchased it and it goes anywhere and everywhere. The great thing is that my 5 year old still can fit in it. I would say the only draw back that I have seen so far is there is not a cup holder or tray. Other than that, it is wonderful!!!"
42223,2,"I bought this to travel with my 2 month old and didn't end up using it because it was ridiculous to try and wrap this thing around my body what seemed like 10x and then try to put the baby in by yourself!Unless you have someone to help you wrap your body and help you put the baby in, I wouldn't recommend this at all!!!"
87033,1,I received this very fast and it was a much better deal than buying in stores. Recommend buying this product.
165370,1,"Really good Buy !!!!! Cheaper then the club stores or box stores. They always on time at your door step. Thanks,"
92382,0,"The product heats my bottles up evenly enough,however, I was a little dissapointed as to the length of time it took to heat one up. 5oz. took almost 7 minutes. When you have a hungry baby,every second counts."
10581,1,"Believe it or not I have been using cloth diapers for years as dish towels. I have never found anything that works quite as well with the ""absorbGerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White"" factor being the key element. I was purchasing them for years at my local K-Mart but they stopped carrying them. Diaper services were out of the question for my needs, so my solution was Amazon.com. I can't tell you how pleased I am to be able to order these online saving time, and money. Fast shipping and true product! Thanks again Tom"
63618,1,"We bought this blanket for our firstborn back in 2008 and it was really wonderful. However, at some point we must have misplaced it because we could not find it anywhere. With the arrival of the new baby though, buying another Nautica blanket was a must! The price was higher by more than 10.00 dollars, which was a serious letdown, but we went ahead and bought it anyway, and have not regretted doing so. I still would have loved the old price though..."
120788,0,"I really like the look of this gate. At first I would have rated it a 5, but with only 4 months use, our two year old was able to break the latch device on the bottom. Now one gate swings freely, and the other we have swings freely in one direction. Also, even though I tightened the gate as tight as humanly possible, the upper latch never really catches with all of the work being done by the now worthless lower latch. When it worked, it was nice, but no longer."
98251,2,"Got this as a gift but returned it soon after we found out how difficult it is to put the toy bar into the holes to attach it to the base of the toy.My husband, who is extremely handy, and I both became frustrated trying to put the bar in the so called holes. They were not exactly a perfect fit. Plus on the box it does not tell you that the toy only attaches to certain types of seats in the car. If anyone successfully put the bar on with ease, let us know. We returned it for something more user friendly. We would not recommend this to anyone."
180366,1,"I ordered this for my husband, but I find myself choosing it over my diaper bag quite often. I love all of the pockets and the inside is very spacious. It's big though, so I had to get something smaller for quick trips."
5436,1,"We purchased a three-seat SUV and wanted something to put trash and ""junk"" in when traveling to keep the floors clean. This works very well. It's washable, but I purchased 3 gallon trash bags to line it and that makes it easy to clean it then re-line it. SO FAR SO GOOD!"
127601,0,"For what you pay for this furniture, you get a decent piece of wood that swings and casters that will roll. Other than that, not much pros about the product. The one support bar across the bottom is flimsy and the mattress is worthless. You are better off paying more money and buying a higer quality product."
6900,1,"I am a true Pampers Cruisers believer. I've tried other brands briefly but this line works best on my 2-year-old, and I have not had as many problems with leaks and blow-outs. I definitely like the added convenience of ordering the value-sized box online. One less thing to struggle with at the grocery store, with a toddler in tow!"
21946,1,"We have had this dresser for almost 3 years. My husband put it together in about 30 minutes if I remember correctly. He is a very skilled carpenter. The dresser still looks brand new even after 2+ years of use. The drawers roll just as smooth as our Pottery Barn furniture (for the record I have not been all that impressed with PB furniture in the past) and hold quite a bit. I really like the height of the dresser, high enough that I can put fragile items on it, but not so high I am afraid our 2 year old will tip it over. I really don't understand what people are complaining about. Maybe the assembly has to be just perfect for the drawers to roll smoothly? I have had cheap furniture (Target brand) in the past as well as more expensive (Ethan Allen, PB, etc) This is much nicer than Target but obviously not EA quality. It is quite heavy to move. I think it looks much better tha the crib and changing table that have exposed screws. Perfect for a childs room."
81064,0,I ordered it for my daughter while I was potty training her and realised that she had hard time sitting on the adult potty. This one served purpose at few places but it does bend and scared my daughter that she is going to fall in potty. So I hardly used it few times.
89034,1,Yes I prefer the dry diapers in the pampers brand. The swaddled and cruiser is a little thich for my baby.
75692,1,"Beautiful designs. I personally feel it could of been better made, but other than that the soon to be mom loved it!"
82232,1,"It's pretty stiff, so even the adults have trouble opening it at times. We definitely needed this item, though."
167948,1,"My 6 month old son has had a terrible time when I bottle feed him. his doctor told me he was under weight and I was desperate to find something that would help him drink his formula. I tried just about every thing from teething tablets, gels to feeding him only solids. At first when I tried the Nuk fast flow he didn't seem to like It, the milk flow was to fast but after a few attempts it's the only nipple he could use now, and he could finish his formula. I think if you have a teething baby you should definitely give these a try."
85937,0,"Excellent baby monitor: good wide range, pretty decent image and screen quality. One bad thing though: we've owned it for a year now (never been dropped or damaged in any way) and it's beggining to show its age: a terrible static sound now makes us put it almost ""in mute"" and image now appears with horizontal bars making impossible to see what your baby is doing. To sum up: excellent choice, but it won't last more than 12 or 13 months."
126309,2,"I used Pampers exclusively for my daughter who is now three. With my two month old son I've had problems with him pooping up his back so thought I would try Huggies since they boasted a snug waistband. Bad idea. Not only does he still go up his back, these diapers are not as soft, irritate my sons skin (and he's not sensitive to other stuff), and now he has daily leaks out the legs. Really an inferior product. I know...these are diapers, but more mess staying in the diapers means less laundry and happier baby. These definitely don't keep the moisture away from the baby's skin as well as Pampers either. Switching back now. On a positive note, Amazon has great prices on Pampers!"
24029,1,I became discouraged when I couldn't find the small shields at any store locally. Purchasing online was so much easier than driving or calling all of the stores looking for these.
145284,1,"Bought this for my 4 month old grandson who loves being 'vertical'. Had to put a pillow on the floor so his feet would touch, but he jumps his heart out...and loves making the sounds come on. I anticipate many months of enjoyment."
155673,1,"I bought the fisher price on-the-go potty first because there were a few negative reviews about the much smaller potette (claims that it collapses, is flimsy, hard to use, too small, etc.)and the FP had a higher star rating. I later bought the potette for a trip and am so very glad I did! When it comes to travel it is FAR SUPERIOR than the big, bulky Fisher price travel potty!The potette is very sturdy if you set it up correctly. You have to click the legs into place. If you set it up without them snapping into place - of course it will be wobbly and possibly collapse! It was set up wrong! When clicked into place the legs are super sturdy and the potette will hold up to 50 pounds. My daughter is 3 and weighs 36 pounds. She had no problems at all using this and I anticipate she will be able to use it till at least kindergarten. I don't get the previous comments about it being too small - perhaps if you have big, big kids it might be too small, but otherwise it's just fine!We recently went on a cruise from Puerto Rico through the Southern Caribbean and this potty was a life-saver!! We went to many national monuments, botanical gardens, a volcano and other outdoor excursions where there were either NO public toilets, or they were super gross hole in the ground toilets. The pottette was the perfect solution in those situations! It is small and lightweight, so it fits in your purse or pack, sets up quick and stays clean. disposal of the used bags is easy because they have absorbent pads inside and you can tie them securely so that they won't make any messes until you find a trash can. The potette has a thick plastic bag it comes in, so you can even stick the used bag inside that with the potette till you find a trash.A comparison between the Fisher-price on-the-go potty and the Potette:This Fisher price one is big and sturdy, has it's own case, you can use plastic grocery bags or trash bags in it, etc. and it's great for keeping in the car for ""kid potty stop emergencies"". However, it is pretty bulky and would not be handy for any walking, hiking type excursions (I'm talking about walks and hikes in places where it would be inappropriate to let them potty in the grass/nature areas & where public toilets are either absent or gross).The potette however, is perfect for such things - it's much smaller & lightweight, has handy bags with absorbent pads, and comes in it's own little bag. The pottette is maybe 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick and 7x7 inches when folded into its bag - easy to stick in your backpack or even a bigger purse. The Fisher price on-the-go potty is significantly bigger! When folded up into it's case it is about 12-14 by 12-14 inches in size and 5-6 inches thick. Won't fit in a purse at all, and would take up a lot of space in a backpack or suitcase if traveling. It does come with it's own handle and shoulder strap, but why lug such a big thing around when the potette will fit directly into your purse or pack? And the potette doesn't weigh anything at all while the fisher price might add an extra pound or two to your load.If you're a stick to town & always use a stroller type person, the Fisher price may be great for you. If you're more of an active, get out and about, carry light & no stroller type the pottete is a much better choice for you. If you're a traveler the pottete is absolutely the best choice!TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The FP potty-on-the-go is great for in your car and people who stick around town, but buy the potette for travel when it would be better to carry a lightweight kiddie potty on your person wherever you may go!"
34444,0,"The reception is fairly good, however, the lcd display is one of the older types where it can only be viewed from certain angles. This makes it difficult to see when the unit is placed higher or lower than your field of view (ie. on a table top). The video camera works great in the dark, in fact it's excellent. The mounting system looks good for a crib, but it is not designed to use on a bassinet. I had to do some ""custom"" mounting to see my son in the bassinet. However, you can place the camera on a table or mount it to the wall if need be. Overall this is a good product, just needs a better screen."
63188,2,"This toybox looks very nice and I love the color. However it is not what I would expect for the price. The wood is thin, and the floor of the box will not support heavy toys. For this price I would expect a solid piece of wood to support toys. I ordered the item with the safety hinges, which once installed are very stiff and when closing the lid, pulled the screws from the frame of the box. Overall, I wouldn't recommend as I think you can find a higher quality toybox for the price."
80680,1,This item was sent to my son and wife for their toddler. They are very pleased with the product.Judy Brown
90184,0,"The elastic in the wasteband is great and fits my little one comfortably. However, Pampers in my opinion doesn't hold as much as Huggies. There have been several times that my little one has woken up with wet clothes while wearing Pampers but that is rare when he is wearing Huggies."
143973,1,"I am very happy with this installation kit! We have a very modern metal railing around our stairs, and this kit made it a breeze to install! I took an extra 30 minutes and spray painted our kit black to match the KidCo Gate, and our metal railing and it turned out great!"
20125,1,"These are the only bottles my 8 week old will drink from. Its not convinient to constantly breast-feed and these bottles are perfect. The nipple on this bottle is so ""real"" and is the only one my boy will use. My son did have gas problems, but after these bottles the problem fanished! I find them really easy to clean and I have used these bottles with my now 20 month old twin boys (just without the natural nipples) The bottom piece is a godsend since I dont have to SCRUB to get the gunk out of the bottle! These are truely great bottles, and they dont leak either!"
183320,1,"This was for my first grandchild. Shipping was fast. Once assembled the product was excellent. I had a little trouble with the instructions,so I called in my son.Everybody loves it."
62503,2,"The hole in the middle is just the right size for little fingers to get in. My son realized this immediately. They manufacturers really need to think of a more clever design. The covers did however successfully keep me out when I needed to open the door. I therefore think it should be called ""parentproof""."
182544,1,"I like this product a lot but I only gave 4 stars because of the size. I had to return the size 3 I purchased (it was too tight) for a size 4 (for a newborn).My son loves it, he falls asleep in it every time."
161370,1,"We were slow to give our baby ""tub"" baths - we used sponge baths until she was 5 1/2 weeks old, when we first used the sling in our kitchen sink. The sling worked great for that. Our first experience with using the tub was a disaster - because we didn't snap the bottom two pieces together. Once we figured out we had to hear a LOUD SNAP to ensure it was together, we've had success ever since. I've read several people complaining that it leaks when you carry it with water in it - the instructions tell you not to do that. We set the tub on our kitchen peninsula and fill it with water from our kitchen sink using a pitcher. After the bath is over, we gently slide the tub so the drainage hole is over the edge of the counter and we drain the water into the pitcher - resealing the drainage seal between pitcher fills. We're very happy with our purchase."
15834,1,This is not a basic item. You can do without it but if you have enough gift cards and can swallow the price--- ITS GREAT! The feel inside is soft/warm but not bunched up and hot. Outside is weather resistant and easy to clean.
133720,2,"we have used these ""unscented"" wipes since our daughter was born 8 years ago. from diaper changes when she was a baby to cleaning sneakers, quick cleaning up of messes, it worked great. it also went from thick larger cloths quilted with the cutest animals to gradually smaller and thinner wipes with dots that i cannot make any sense out of. but, they still cleaned well and i didn't mind doubling up the sheets at times.my husband bought a large box of ""unscented"" wipes and when i opened one of the packages, it smelled so strong i discarded the entire box thinking we bought the wrong thing. we bought another large box and made sure we saw the word ""unscented"" on the box and again, it smelled so bad i cannot imagine exposing a baby to those kind of chemicals. i called pampers and asked if they put ""scented"" wipes in the boxes marked ""unscented"" by mistake and they confirmed they had changed the formula with no perfume but a new masking agent to hide the smell of the ingredients. acording to my dictionary, perfume is a fragrant liquid typically made from essential oils extracted from flowers and spices - that means they have added scents made from chemicals and still call these wipes ""unscented"". sadly, we have switched brands after all these years of enjoying the real ""unscented"" pampers baby wipes."
57180,1,"We got this gate to enclose our puppy in the kitchen/family room. My teenagers installed it in less than 15 minutes. Great features: door swings both ways, door swings closed (but not locked; although you can ""lock it"" by lifting it and it catches in the neutral position, we rarely do), you can keep the door open if you swing it open fully. We leave it swung closed away from the kitchen. This let's our cat push it open to get through from hall to kitchen but puppy cannot push it the other way."
48214,1,"If you have the Arm's reach, you will need at least one spare sheet so you don't have to worry about getting the bed changed in the middle of the night after a leaky and/or blown out diaper... My only complaint is that you must stick the velcro to itself when washing or it will stick to everything else!!!"
94006,1,I've had no issue with it yet. I just needed some nipples and locally the stores were to expensive and I didn't feel like traveling to target. Good stuff.
16894,1,"This bed rail is very sturdy and tight against the mattress, so tight that it takes some work to change the sheets without taking the rail down.If you do take the rail down, the straps and the metal piece on the other side have a chance to move around under the bed. So, I do not take the side down and slide it under the bed. I also leave it where it is in the upright position all the time so that it has less of a chance of breaking down at the hinge points, etc.Great rail and I love the length of it."
181953,1,No more worries about being too short and missing the bowl. Yea!!!

139416,1,"I bought this for my 5 year old son. He was always afraid of the dark, and would always need the hall light on in order to go to sleep. As soon as he got this, he allowed me to turn the hall light off and slept with this on every night for about 2 months, and now he will go to bed with no lights at all. I also like that this goes off after a certain amount of time as to not waste the batteries."
32766,0,"I was so excited to receive a Baby Bjorn for a shower gift. Especially being a Swede myself. Anyhow, when our Baby came in November we used it a few times.. but b/c it was the winter and we were never really out and about .. we didn't use it as often as I thought I would. Sam also was 9lbs at birth. So it wasn't long before he was to heavy to carry. Maybe if he had been born in the spring or summer I would have gotten more use out of it. But now at 6 1/2 months he is 22lbs and way to heavy for me to carry in front. We prefer to carry him in a backpack.I have no doubt that the Baby Bjorn is great.. just remember to take in consideration the month you give birth and the size of your baby. Hopefully with the next one I will use it more often."
101524,0,This was well-made and as advertised but a bit smaller than I had really expected. You should also note that you can't fold the stroller with this attached although the size is perfect for the Maclaren strollers.
170764,1,Item was shipped and received very quickly. Item was exactly as stated and expected. Very well-packed. These sheets are a great value!
44206,2,"This does indeed deflect the water for a softer ""waterfall"" flow but it was full of mold/mildew in less than a month! The part that the water hits first when it comes out of the spout (the deflector) has a tiny hole that is supposed to drain any water that pools there. This hole drains too slowly and is ineffective at preventing mold/mildew from growing. As I speak the hole is entirely black and the area around it is covered in mildew as well. It's not just where the water hits directly, either. We removed the deflector to soak it in bleach and the entire interior part that rests on the metal spout was also covered in mildew. This is a difficult area to clean as it's has little ridges and dents and pockets and the material is a somewhat flexible rubber so it cannot just be wiped clean. We soaked it in a bucket of bleach for a day or two and scrubbed it and got it looking acceptable, but still off-color and in less than a week all the mildew was back. We have good ventilation in our bathroom so that's not the issue. Only buy this if you plan to remove it and thoroughly dry it by hand after every bath. It also did not fit my water spout very well and I have a very standard spout. It did fit in the end but seemed ""off."" As of now, every bath my daughter takes is full of water that has passed through mildew and mold on its way into the tub which is gross so I am removing it and getting rid of it. I won't be buying another one."
79594,0,I like the way it is set up but I don't like that if you have slippery floors it does not stay planted on the floor it slides on the bottom there is no support on the bottom just plastic so it tends to slide
51244,1,"I bought this on my 2nd trimester and I can't imagine sleeping without it now!I took 1 star because I do advise buying it with the 100% cotton cover with zipper. This pillow comes with a white polyester cover that is as hard to take out as it is to put it back! And after sleeping on it for a while you will want to take that cover out to wash it...Other than that, the product is excellent and I am very happy I purchased it when I did."
1691,1,"I can't review these diapers the way an experienced momma can. Nor can I tell you how much better they are than the ""leading brand"". When I hear that phrase in a commercial, I always ask, ""If Your Brand is so much better than the 'leading brand,' then shouldn't Your Brand be the 'leading brand?'""But I digress.I'll promote Pampers Baby Dry for this one simple reason. Several days ago, I was playing with my 14-month-old daughter in the living room. It was ""Hop-On-Pop"" kind of playing. We laughed and had a lot of fun. Then mom took the baby for her bath. She then shouted to me, ""Did you not smell her?"" ""Nope, never smelled a thing."" ""Well, she has diarrhea."" And I did what any squeamish dad would have done. I checked myself over to make sure no...uh, well, poop had leaked out on me.I understand that every baby is different, and every mom and dad are different. So, take my humorous little anecdote with a grain of salt. But this baby was crawling and falling and hopping all over Pop. And my ultra-sensitive nasal passages never smelled a thing and everything stayed...in it's proper place."
138762,1,"I saw this turtle while finding a suitable gift for my niece who was turning 4 this year. I read the description and ordered it. She was so excited to see it. She kept asking me where I buy gifts from coz she loved it so much. She wasnt ready to share it with anyone. Now, she uses it every night.The smile on her face....Its worth all that I paid. Its a perfect gift for kids."
72538,1,"This one is the bare bones version. It is sturdy, easy to use and clean. For the price, you can not go wrong."
84837,1,Like many other reviewers these were too narrow to fit over my bifold doors. Then by accident I discovered that it has an insert to make it narrower. To take this out turn the nob clockwise and will eventually come out. This makes it a little wider. This wasn't apparent to me when I bought it.
31755,1,I bought this for my son when he turned 1. We lived in a small New York City apartment and the toys were everywhere. I am happy to say that my son just turned 2 and this unit is still in great shape. It looks just like it did the day we put it together. I think the colors are great for kids and my son has no trouble now taking books out or putting them in. The bins hold a lot of stuff and they are very durable (my son went through a phase where he sat in the bins). It only took me about half an hour to put together and is very sturdy. I'm sure that this organizer will last him a long time.
181010,1,"My 3 month old baby loves this playmat! He lays under it several times a day and is always happy to hang out in the rainforest :) He will stare at those ""butterfly girls"" hanging from the center and just smile and coo at them. He also likes the monkey and the elephant rattle. The mirror is great, too, although I agree with another review that said it's at an awkward angle and needs held for the baby to see in it well, although my baby will look at other reflections in it and even grab at it to turn it himself. The lower hanging toys are at a perfect height for him to bat at while laying on his back. When on his belly, he likes to look at the scene on the mat, too. The music is catchy (everyone at my house can sing it LOL) and I appreciate the 2 levels of volume. The rainforest sounds are nice for a more quiet, soothing playtime. I like that there are multiple hanging hooks all around so you can move toys around and add your own additions. The bottom mat can go in the washing machine and dryer and comes out great. This is a favorite spot for my baby and has given him hours of enjoyment (as well as 15 minute windows of time for mom to fold laundry, etc. while he plays contentedly! :)"
56252,2,"The idea of this product is great. We get so much static that it's almost impossible for us to even use this, I've been startled numerous times in the middle of the night. It's so loud at night that we have to turn the volume down almost all the way, which totally defeats the purpose. When there's a lot of static the picture is so distorted you can't see anything. You can't leave the screen on at night because it lights up the entire room. The picture isn't very clear, so it's hard to watch for detailed movement - like breathing. I would not recommend this product."
40726,1,I tired other store brands and decided not to waste my timeon trying anymore. Pampers are the best! PERIOD!
181044,1,Very colorful. Our son lives this gym. We love watching him play inside the gym.
169766,0,"I bought the Peanut Shell when my son was 6 weeks old. He was a very fussy baby and this dramatically reduced his fussiness and my stress level. I loved that I could easily fold it and tuck it into the diaper bag. It is easy to use and not overly hot due to excess material. I used it for him in the chest-to-chest carry, kangaroo carry, and hip carry. I clean houses for a living and take him with me so it's very important that I could carry him at times but also have him out of the way.My baby loved to sleep in the sling and he always seemed comfortable. I never had a problem getting it off and keeping him asleep. I would just hold him under his legs/bum with one arm and use the other arm to slip the sling over my head and lay him down on a bed.On the downside...I thought the price was a little steep for a loop of fabric!!!My son is now 5 1/2 months and 17 lbs. He seems to be inbetween the size where he fits completely in the sling and where he sits with his bum in the sling and his legs hanging out. I always felt like he wasn't very safe when I tried it with his legs out. And I definatly wasn't comfortable with putting him on my back.Additionally, although it does a pretty good job of distributing his weight by the time I take him out I usually feel out of whack. In the hip carry the weight pulls on one shoulder and pushes in on the opposite hip. Another thing that was difficult is that with my job I do a lot of reaching and the sling seemed to limit mobility on the side that it hung from.I loved that it was so simple but at the same time I struggled a bit to get it just right. It always felt like he was hanging a bit low and maybe this contribute to me be sore after a while.Conclusively, I loved the sling for a while but now that my son is older/bigger I've moved onto the Ergo Baby Carrier. I will definatley be hanging onto the Peanut Shell for my next baby though!!! Maybe I can have my son on my back and another baby in the Peanut Shell on the front. That'll turn some heads!!!!"
182505,1,"we chose this peg perego stroller for the quality and we are surprise that really is hight quality, In mexico is very expensive but amazon has great prices and like a Prime Member I didnt pay nothing for the shipment. Great!!!"
79082,0,My 17 month old son loves this pacifier - however - the problem is that it is addictive! Babies love it so they don't want to be separate from it and he is contstantly asking for it. It was the first pacifier he was introduced to so her will not take any other pacifier. This is a huge headache because its very hard to find them in some stores and when we lost it while on vacation we had a very very hard day. Even though it is the best pacifier and the most satisfying for children I will NOT buy it again for my future kids because its so hard to find them and different from other pacifiers so if your child likes this one they won't take any other.
6691,0,"the Pampers are just fine. no real complaints as they do they're job well and most times will accomodate the largest deposits by your little one.the only issue i have is with the sesame street characters Pampers puts on them.1. how much would consumers save by not having to cover the licensing costs2. the little ones don't give a hoot about the characters and if they do spend a lot of time staring at thier wastebands, you should have them examined by a professional"
147679,0,"I got one of these for my daughter and loved it so much I bought another! The first one was perfect...fuzzy outside, soft satin feeling on the inside and the vent concept at the bottom would put my new-mom worries at rest (&#34;is she too hot/cold?&#34;). The second one I got though had all that but with a faulty zipper. We're talking almost impossible to latch/zip and when you do get it be careful trying to unzip it and not punch your baby in the face! The first one's zipper worked just fine though. I'd say buy it, but check the zipper and exchange it if you get a bad one. Alternatively you could directly contact the manufacturer...I didn't with this product but on others they've been very helpful with wonderful customer service."
171235,0,"My son has outgrown this bathtub at 4 months. The lip that holds his bottom below the incline is too shallow, he slips right over it and into the water. I just purchased the Primo and LOVE it, great for larger size babies."
95236,2,"had to drive to Michigan from Alabama so needed a warmer for the car. After reading the unfavorable reviews, I still purchased it, I only needed it for this trip and our family vacation in a couple of weeks. Well, it warmed one bottle very well...it took about 45 minutes, just as another customer said. then, when time for 2nd bottle, the light was on but it would not get warm. So, every 3 hours we were getting hot coffee from a gas station. I do NOT recommend this product. I wasted 10 bucks and some change!"
121541,0,When buying this product.... Make sure you purchase glad outdoor fresh sheild bags and sassy's diaper sacks. These will help to keep the bad diaper smell from taking over.
184251,1,"We got this as a hand me down. Two words: LIFE SAVER.The product is great quality.Thte other reviews summed it up:Use a receiving blanket as a mattress linerBaby will scoot down and toss legs through mesh, so move toward middle of bed or use a pillow to stop it.SUPER convenient to use for a resting place on the couch, traveling to grandmas, at a picinic, etcLight is a nice feature at night for random baby checks or feedingsJust spend the $40 and get it."
176466,0,"My sister used this pump for 3 months (daily) and passed it down to me which I was able to use for 3 months (daily) and then it died on me. I used it much more than the occasional use that it's meant for (which I didn't know this at the time). I used it about 5-6 times a day for the first month and then 3 times a day for the following 2 months before it died. It's horribly loud which can drive you nuts so I put a blanket over to drown out the noise. My husband was actually glad when it died because then we could buy another one that's less noisy even if it meant we had to spend $200 on a new one. I guess we got good use out of it considering how much it was improperly used but if you are looking to use a pump more than once per day I would definitely get the Medela Swing model...it's GREAT and is much quieter. After listening to a baby crying all the time, listening to this pump was the last thing I wanted to do so if you value silence...steer clear!"
115573,1,"The material is soft, it opens conveniently and it's easy to put on. My husband and I loved it."
61281,1,"In response to concerns mentioned, might I suggest a couple of things. In order to not end up with a bag full of diapers at the bottom, tie a knot in the bottom of the bag, and make sure a few inches of the bag are sticking out of the Genie before snapping it shut. This is what keeps the odor down. Also, if the wheel is difficult to turn, exchange it! My husband and I have found this item indispensable for our three children, and have never had a problem."
91746,1,"This rain canopy is cool! It is really easy to slip over the stroller and it is long enough so that your toddler's feet don't get wet. I have a Graco Duo-Glider stroller and wish they made a rain canopy for it, but buying two of these works pretty good too. I keep them in the stroller's basket for quick access during a rain shower. Great product!"
84266,1,"My 6-month-old son loves this swing, but the ropes are a mess! As other reviewers said, the ropes are twisted or uneven or something. The swing swings a little lop-sided. I almost put the swing back in the box and returned it to Amazon, but my dad twisted the ropes before hanging it on the hooks, and it works a little better. The crookedness doesn't seem to bother my son, so we'll keep it..."
120678,1,"I read the other reviews and decided to try these diapers as burp rags - what else gets so much mileage with a new baby??? I LOVE them - they are extremely soft, and seem to get softer with every washing, but they're durable, too. I would buy more in a heartbeat, and would recommend them to friends."
131307,1,"This item is perfect for strapping that &#34;precious cargo&#34; into carts and, in our case, a small rocking horse that didn't have a restraint. It's very good quality, nice and wide for comfort, and very easy to use. The Velcro really holds, making it almost impossible for the child to &#34;escape&#34;; yet it takes just a quick tug by an adult to release it. Great product."
29329,0,My pig came with pink paint scratched off the nose. Cute otherwise. Love the tutu and the size was perfect.
138282,1,My six year old falls asleep every night with the twilight turtle. I like that it automatically turns off after 15 minutes so I don't have to disturb her. This is a great solution for children who are afraid of the dark!
25,0,The dish is very very difficult to separate but is otherwise functional at making the food warmer. I haven't found anything else on the market that warms food without microwaving so it definitely serves its purpose.
112221,0,I decided to give these diapers a try. They are great and my son seems very comfortable in them. However I will stick with Pampers Snug and Dry as I get more for my money with them. The cruisers are too expensive.
48761,0,We only use this to go around the christmas tree and we have used it 2 years now. It works but it is really hard to get it in a circle. The hinges are really really tight.
160270,0,"This blanket works really well, although they are too short. My son grew out of it by 2 & 1/2 months."
85744,0,Once we had it assembled it was nice. Instructions are not as clear as they could be. It is sturdy. Overall recommend.
96636,1,I bought this for a friend for his glass water bottle and it is perfect! The color is great and it protects the bottle really well. He was carrying it and slipped out of his hand onto cement - the glass bottle wasn't damaged at all!
160336,1,"This is a great swaddler, it's very quick and easy to use. It is also soft and the baby really seems to enjoy it. The velcro could use some improvement, but we still love it."
47173,1,"Every double stroller is not perfect, you just need to find one that fits your needs. We needed one that would fit in our 2010 CRV and this one did. With the infant attachment and canopy off, this stroller is pretty compact. We needed to take off the infant attachment every time we put back in the car, pretty easy to do but it's just an extra step you need to take. Your child does hit the back seat rest while seated in the back, it hasn't been an issue. Stroller basket has plenty of room but hard to get to if your child is seating down, not a big deal, we have stroller hooks. The large size canopy will be nice for those days in the parks. Majority of our travel is short trips to the store, so this stroller works great for us. Compact, easy to maneuver, and fits in our car."
181172,1,"only reason for not giving a full five stars is i had expected the butterflies to move (part of a mobile). for the price FischerPrice charges for this gym, it should be possible to add a small motor to make the butterflies move. other then that, everything about the gym is good and the baby is having lots of fun."
50772,1,"I have had this pillow for two months now and I love it. It is huge but we have a queen bed and although it takes up a little room, my husband can still sleep very comfortably in the bed with me and the pillow. I had sciatica in my first trimester of pregnancy along with lots of tossing and turning. After we bought this pillow, my sciatica has went away completely and outside of having to get up to go to the bathroom, I have very restful sleep throughout the night. I love that is had multiple functions including wrapping it around your body for breast feeding, using it to prop yourself up while reading or using it as a wedge pillow by positioning it a certain way. I also love that it comes with instructions on the many uses of the pillow. It does come with a white cover which is great and if you want a different colored cover you have the option of ordering them."
172662,2,The whole idea of a baby tub with a shower is an excellent idea...but I think they need to redesign the shower handle. It is almost impossible to hold the sprayer comfortably without blocking the water spray. Not to mention the button to get the water to spray is extremely hard to press down. The tub itself is a nice size and comes with the sling which helps a lot. I recommend buying a regular tub with a sling rather than spending the few extra bucks for the sprayer that doesn't work that well. A cup or washcloth will do the trick.
166256,1,"I am really happy with Pampers - we have used them since he was born. Each size works great, and the 'Baby Dry' diapers really work well for overnight. They are soaked in the morning - but contain the liquid well."
166458,1,They are diapers so not much to say but the package and everything was just as they said it would be. My son never explodes through them so they are great.
155599,1,"This is a wonderful, very helpful product. I think it's usefulness goes well beyond potty training. My daughter is completely potty trained, but we still carry this potty in the car so that she doesn't have to use the not-always-sparkling-clean gas station bathrooms when we travel. To me this is an absolute MUST for anybody who likes to travel with children. Its design makes it so convenient that it even fits in my shoulder bag, perfect for those long walks. The portable potty completely eliminates the need for public restrooms, and that to me is absolutely amazing."
61562,1,There's nothing fancy about this baby monitor set but it does the job it's intended to. Sometimes there is a lot of static but repositioning it usually does the trick (and even if there is some static you can still hear your baby just fine).
106802,1,We were going to buy a cheaper model but then decided to go with this one. Well let me tell you it was worth it! This is a great product. It can be used with one hand which is convient when you are holding your child and does not smell. It also uses regular garbage bags which is much less expensive then those stupid cartridges. The only time you will smell anything with this product is when you empty it.
180559,0,"I agree that this blanket is very soft. The reason I only give it 3 stars is that it is really a thin blanket. The product description left me believing I would receive a heavier-weight blanket. I have several baby blankets made of velboa. They are a thicker velboa and while just as soft, the heavier weight and plushness of them makes them much cozier. This blanket is just OK when you consider the price. If you want a plush, soft throw blanket that is worth the higher price, look at the Little Giraffe and Barefoot Dreams brands."
171121,1,"We got one of these from Things Remembered when my son was born, and we were kind of baffled as to its function. It's larger than a traditional lovey, but too small for a blanket. Since he was a couple months old he has needed something soft against his face to sleep with, so we would lay this underneath him and he would pick up a paw and rub on his face. Now that he's a year old, he carries it everywhere and refuses to sleep without it. SO glad to find an identical spare for a reasonable price!"
111063,1,"This is a MUST have product for every nursing Mom. In fact it has now become my new standard baby shower gift. I can't tell you how many times I have had mothers ask me about it when I'm using it. And the few times that I have left it at home and had to use a blanket to cover while nursing, I have really learned to appreciate my nursing cover. It makes such a difference to be able to see my baby while she nurses, to readjust latch, etc. Plus she can't pull this off like she does with a blanket. And I can use both hands since I'm not using one hand to hold the blanket. Definitely one of my top ""can't live without"" baby items."
168283,1,Love the wetness indicator feature (though sometimes it does indicate correctly). About 80% of the time it is perfect. No leaks from the bottom. Holds up well for couple of hours. Diaper rash does occur but it is quite natural when one uses diapers continuously.
43020,0,"Moby wrap worked well when my baby was NB. It kept her close to my chest and I could cover her face with the fabric to protect her from the sun while she slept. However, it was pain in the butt to take her in and out during the doctor's visit. I now use Ergo."
106555,1,"This is on my list of must haves. The thing has been in my bedroom for 6 months. Not once have I ever smelled an odor from this thing. I love that I can use any kind of bag so I just buy those super cheap super flimsy tall size garbage bags.The only drawback, as with all diaper pails, is that as the baby gets bigger and the diapers get bigger, you have to change the bag more often. Our baby is 6 months and we fill it about once every 36 hours.But still, I wouldn't trade it for the world."
27630,1,"This was the only way we could get our newborn to do tummy time. Flat on his stomach when he couldn't hardly raise his head at all just freaked him out and he'd cry and cry. But with the little raised pillow, it would keep him from having his face smoshed into the floor and he'd be more patient with trying to look around. Now that he's 4 months and able to lift his own head fine he doesn't really need the extra booster pillow, and he didn't start playing with the water bit until 3 months. Plus the velcro on one of the toy links wouldn't hold. But the little attached toys are very nice - we made a belt for his infant carrier and put them there where he plays with them all the time. But I think it's very nice for a baby as they learn head control so that it lifts them a bit off the ground so they don't panic as much."
8438,0,"We've had this on our coffee table since our first daughter started crawling a few years ago.Pros:- The color fit in very nicely with our dark wood coffee table. People always commented on how they couldn't even tell there was padding.- The padding itself is very cushiony and provides great protection against bumps and falls.That is where the pros end, though. :(Cons:- The sticky tape that comes with the product DOES NOT hold on the cushion for very long. You can pretty much just pull the foam right off after a month or so. The corners are constantly falling off. We like to prop our feet up on the coffee table, and our feet would slowly pull the foam off and we were always having to put it back on.- Our kids like to snack on the coffee table, so the foam falling off provided a great sticky place for lots of crumbs to stick. So now underneath the foam we have this gross, sticky, crumby mess.- Overall, the biggest hassle is getting the adhesive off the furniture once you want to take it off for good. We got so fed up that we just decided to take it off completely and we were shocked at how difficult it is. We even bought some Goo Gone and Goof Off, and neither even made a dent. So now we have these awful sticky lines of adhesive on a formerly nice coffee table.I would advise against buying this product unless you a) can find a better way to attach it to your furniture so it doesn't fall off, and b) don't care about the furniture at all and plan to throw it away once you don't need this anymore.You'd be better off just buying some other sort of padding that goes in a stretchy cover that you can take off with ease."
26687,0,"I bought this because I've liked the extra-tall model that has plastic panels, like this does. That extra-tall model (bought in a store but apparently available cheaper on amazon) has kept very agile little dogs from climbing over a wire mesh safety gate and kept a less-agile little dog from trying, getting stuck and getting hurt again. However, I've gotten tired of clambering over the extra-tall one myself while it is in place to avoid inadvertently letting an injured foster dog mix with my other dogs. I went to the manufacturer's site and saw they are not making the short (23"") model anymore but that they might be available in stores or on line from other sellers. I was glad to find it here, and on sale. I thought I might get two and stack them, then just remove one to step over. But for now I just bought one. I'm glad the price was low, because it does not seem to be constructed in as sturdy a manner as the similar tall one--or as the short wire mesh ones. The side vertical pieces of wood are not as wide as on the other models, and so in order to make the hortizontal latching pieces line up, there is a small metal part attaching the vertical piece and the horizontal latching bar on one side. I fear that it will not be sturdy enough over time. On the other hand, the thinner vertical pieces will probably make it fit in the doorway more easily. We'll see! For now, I think it's a good deal."
93411,2,Nothing wrong with product but I find it totally useless.I had amazon card left with some balance so bought it.
36142,1,I was so pleased when I received this in the mail. It is really attractive and easy to use. My 6 week old son likes it and it is easy to breastfeed in it. I bought a Moby wrap and it was too much of a pain to wear for any short period of time. I will be buying another Lite on Shoulder sling soon so that I have an extra!
14744,1,I have tried most bottles that are sold in stores. This bottle has a lid that actually keeps the bottle from leaking. It costs a little more than other bottles but the price is worth it. No more digging in the diaper bag and there is spilt milk.
148216,1,"I read other people reviews before I made my choice for my newborn baby Girl. The best buy, she loves it, and all my family loves this product because we can do something while she is so comfortable there."
28379,1,"i was going to order a white one but liked the denim one better, but didnt notice the 30 dollar diference, till it was to late, then i tried to cancle it the next day, but they gave me no option, but it was a done deal, that it had been shipped , so i checked on it threw fed-x, no such order !!!! that was just the first lie. then it took 10 days to get here, i live in chattanooga ten, 5 miles from a million sq foot facility, and then found out they shipped it from a third party in the state of washington. so they also gave out my credit card number , i wont do bussines with them again , for 5 yrs, thats there fiscal punishment for the lies and deset. i buy a lot, im retired, and have time to look for a good deal, BUT will only deal with honest company's.i tried to reason with them for several day's. over a chair they will lose about, 150.000 dollars in sales over a 5 yr period. probally even more having 2 new grandchildren, if i wouldnt get in trouble i would of took it out to there entrance and burned it, and bought one at wal mart."
71813,1,"My 2 year old daughter is recently potty trained but she does not like to use the ""big potties"" when we go shopping. This thing is awesome! I just carry it like I would a diaper bag, go into the stall, she sits on it and goes right away! You can use any 4 gallon trash bag. We also use it on road trips and she can sit and go in the back of our Yukon anytime! She is tall for her age and she fits fine. It has made potty training while we are out and about an absolute BREEZE! Buy it, it's totally worth it!"
3369,1,The pacifier seems well made. The baby looks cute and funny with it and everyone gets a good laugh when they see him sucking on it.
165088,1,"I have been reading several reviews about the Baby Dry and have come to the same conclusion that many other moms have, and that is that it depends on your child and how they are shaped and how much they poop or pee. The Baby Dry are my favorite because they fit my child the best and keep most of the leaks in. My second favorite is the Swaddlers, but they tended to let leaks out of the leg holes on my son. I have noticed with the Baby Dry, if there is a lot of pee in the diaper, then once he poops, it doesn't absorb very well because it has already absorbed a lot. Also, the poop does go up the back of the diaper, as many moms have said, but I tend to wait until he is done going, and then go change it. If the child sits in his poop, he will get diaper rash and you don't want that anyway. My son has never gotten diaper rash and I have used Pampers almost exclusively since he was born. Baby Dry fits my child the best and works for us the best all around, but you have to find the best for your child. I read a review that said that Pampers tend to be for longer, skinner babies and Huggies tend to be for chunkier children, and I think that's right."
4072,0,"This safety rail would probably be ideal for a bed with a box spring, but for a bed with slats, some creative positioning is required to make it work. It does what it is supposed to do which is keep my children from falling out of the bed, but for the type of bed they have, we will probably have to adjust the rail every night to make sure it stays in place on the slats. Not a bad purchase, however, buyers should be aware of this before ordering."
54974,1,"The first thing I want to stress is that I wouldn't use this gate for safety applications, such as at the top of stairs or to keep kids out of the kitchen. I haven't had any problems with mine opening by itself, but other people have so you should keep that in mind when buying.This gate is pressure mounted, but we converted it easily to a hardware mounted gate using four shallow plastic cups that were originally used to hardware mount a gate we used to have in our kitchen. You can probably find something similar at a hardware store if you need to hardware mount this gate (our kids know how to push over pressure mounted gates so we needed to do this).We use this gate to control access to certain areas of the house, where the kids are allowed to play but where they are not allowed to take mountains of toys. In our house, toys have to stay in their bedrooms, and they can take one toy at a time into the living room. If they want another toy, they have to take the first one back to the bedroom. This gate is PERFECT for that application because I control when they are allowed to go through it, and I don't have to constantly stop what I'm doing to go open the gate for them. They just stand at the gate and say ""buzz me in!"" and I use the remote control to let them through. Then when they want back through I can see what they're bringing with them, and either let them in or tell them they have to put something back in their room(s) first. This is a really great low-stress way to help my kids learn to clean up after themselves. I don't have to nag them all the time and my living room stays clean!My only two gripes about this gate: it doesn't automatically close, so I have to make sure the kids know they are supposed to close the gate behind them. Also the motion sensing light is great at night, but it works all through the day too, which is a drain on the batteries. The switch to turn this feature on is located inside the battery compartment, so I can't easily shut it off during the day.This gate is one-of-a-kind so if you need something that can be remotely operated you need this particular gate. I was pleased to discover that it was very easy to set up for exactly what we needed."
61808,1,We bought 2 of these car seats and love them. We previously had the Alpha Omega which we gave to our sitter. This car seat is top of the line!
115146,2,"Our 20 month old can get through it with no problem what so ever. Called Summer Infant and they told me ""our gates can not be installed onto molding or baseboard"". But guess what? On the box is pictured the gate installed over baseboard! When I confronted the rep about this fact, she said she would email me. This is a very UNSAFE product! We will be taking further action. There are several reports about this product being unsafe and Summer Infant knows it! This gate is going to get a baby injured or killed!!! Does not latch safely! DO NOT BUY!!! I wish I had know this before we bought it! We have reported it to the CPSC. There is only 1 published report, but we were told that ""several are under review""! DO NOT BUY!!!"
90583,1,"Great diapers and great value! We LOVE pampers! They are very soft, stretchy and provide wonderful protection. We haven't had any leak yet!"
106402,1,"We first bought Diaper Genie (DG) because it was heavily marketed. When we got it home, we went through 3 refills, then discovered 1) the refills were going to be costly 2) it takes more time making sure the bag spiral wouldn't come undone, otherwise, all the diapers collected into just an open space, no different than a regular trash can.When we returned the DG and got the Diaper Champ (DC), we noticed it was easy to set up and easy to operate. The only bag trick was to make sure the bag went through the inside blue hole, then make sure the blue holder holds the ends down. There's only one blue thing in the inside, so you can't miss it. Compared to the DG, I didn't have to spend 30 minutes explaining to our babysiter (over 60 years old) how to ignore our baby while trying twist the diaper into the bag.DG and Diaper Dekor (DD) both use refills, which to me, is a rip-off. Even though DD doesn't go through them often, I don't like to have, yet another thing to remember to maintain. Since the DC uses regular garbage bags, I'm able to buy a Sam's Club mega-size pack, then never have to worry about it for a year.I would have given DC 5 stars, but after about a year of usage, the inside seal comes apart, losing the only thing between your nose and the stinky diapers.For those who complain about the DC not being able to handle large diapers... Stop feeding your kid those brontosaurus burgers with milk shakes, it's not healthy!"
92710,1,"This is SO convenient and easy to use. We have used it on our bedroom door for years, to hold it open during the day, and easily close it at night. The ""wedge"" type door stops do not work with our carpet at all, and this door positioner works anywhere!"
82189,1,"After trying out monitor after monitor, thank God we finally came across this one. It doesn't click or pick up truckers 10-4'in down the freeway. It recognizes every noise in the room. Although it's not as fancy looking as the other ones, it works better than any of them. We have occasionally heard weird noises that it has picked up from outside interference, but it is very rare that this happens. We actually use this for our 3 year old's room now and are registered for another one for our next due in October. Save yourself time, sleep and money and opt for the uglier but better of the monitors!"
153589,0,"This shade is gorgeous, we have the JoJo Designs Oriental Garden. The problem is that we have been to Target, Walmart, Lowes, Kohl's and a few other random stores and still cannot find a lamp base that fits this shade. Right now it is an odd table decoration since we don't know what to do with it."
43857,0,"My 9 month old moves a lot and tries to grab everything around him. This seat doesn't hold him well enough. I have to stay very close next to him to make sure he doesn't go on one side. I prefered the ""bag"" type to travel, as two straps hold his upper body in place."
80430,1,"This is an awesome purchase. It is so easy to use - you can even put it on the cart one handed. The pattern is absoulutely adorable, and my daughter seems so much more comfortable! I would definitely reccomend this product to anyone with small children. I haven't tried it on a restaurant high chair yet, but I'm sure it will be great!"
120314,0,This was a great changing pad until my son got bigger and more active. As he grew and became stronger this pad tore easily with his little legs kicking around. Next time I'll be getting a pad that just has the two sides to keep him and our future babies from rolling off.
94476,0,"I am a first time mom, when I created my baby registry I reviewed the comments on the avent bottles, one thing they don't say is that this bottles are no good if you're planning to breastfeed and use a bottle once or twice a day for DH to share the joy. I got avent and dr. brown's bottles and none of them have been 100% satisfactory for my baby. The avent leaks and the silicone nipple is too bulky on my baby's mouth, the liners are difficult to work with. I also tried Dr. Brown's and they leak more than the Avent, plus it's takes longer to ensemble (in the middle of the night when you're trying to fix some formula) After trying all of these bottles, my baby didn't seem as happy as taking the real thing (don't get me wrong, I'm happy to breastfeed, but sometimes my nipples get soared) I came across the PLAYTEX bottles with rubber nipples. Believe me they do the job as close to the real thing as you can get. Get the EASY DROP INS with a round opening to fit on the bottle without trying to open the liner from the sides. The nipples are great to combine breastfeeding and bottle."
137093,1,"Our son would never take a paci if it weren't for soothies!!! and there is no giving it up now! --now that we have the same nipple for our bottle. no more nipple confusion! :oPThey are great, no complaints. I don't know why the previous reviewer only gave 4 stars. If you don't screw ANY bottle tight enough it leaks ...duh!"
85584,1,"I've tried several diaper bags, including Nicole Miller and Eddie Bauer. My oldest child is now five years old, so when I had my second baby I had to purchase some additional things. One of those items was a diaper bag. In truth, the Baby Bjorn Dynamic diaper bag is a bit bulky. I'm only 5'3"" tall and it does get cumbersome at times; however, the backpack conversion feature makes it very versatile and I can carry it on my back without having to use my hands at all (which are often occupied with other things, including baby in his car seat, or holding my daughter's hand, etc). I give it 5 stars because, in my opinion, it is very roomy. If I take out the changing pad that comes inside the middle section, I can put a change of clothes in there, not only for my son, but for myself as well. There are lots of compartments that can be used for just about every baby need imaginable. I'm nursing, so I can't say how many bottles it would hold, but I'd say more than a few. I like the looks of this bag. It is very sleek. All in all, the only downside of this bag is its size for someone who is really short. One last thought: When I ordered this bag from Amazon, it came with its original tags, but was missing the changing pad. I had to return it to Amazon (at their expense). I then ordered a replacement from Amazon which came complete with the changing pad, but then the original diaper bag tag was missing. I kept it because I could tell it was brand new and I didn't want to wait for it again. If you can find it elsewhere I'd recommend you buy it from them. However, it is worth getting it here since right now (and from time to time), they have the baby sale (buy $99.00 worth or merchandise and get $10.00 off), so you really are getting it shipped for free."
16153,1,"I have purchased several of these, one for myself and others for baby gifts. A lot of mothers we know have these as well. We have used ours for soccer games and most recently at the beach for our little girl who didn't want to sit in the sand. We just hose it off when we are done playing at the beach."

75664,2,"It took forever for the crib-Angelina- to get in stock and to arrive once ordered.The crib arrived with 2 headboards and no footboards. I have been on the phone with the company daily for a month. Sometimes the call goes directly into the answer machine which says I should call back during business hours, IT IS. The call has been dropped many times during the wait, which is forever.The company could not or would not give me any information as to when or if my part would be replaced. I was told several times that a supervisor had been notified and would return my call, never happened.I finally called Baby's RUS and they agreed to pick up the crib and refund my money.This company-Storkcraft- has the very worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with, in fact they have NO customer service.I would NEVER purchase another item from Storkcraft."
12282,2,"I read all the great reviews on this gate before deciding which to purchase. I wanted a sturdy, nice-looking swing gate for the top of our stairs. After about an hour and a half the gate is installed only to find that I don't like it at all. The gate looks very nice but the latching mechanism is horrible in my opinion. It is very difficult to get open and closed especially when carrying a baby. This one is going back today and I will opt for The First Years Simple and Secure Stair gate. I hope it opens easier!"
59305,1,"My daughter recently moved into a house with a balcony on the second floor that overlooks the first floor. I worried that my toddler grandson would easily slip through the rails so I ordered this product. It was easy to install, looks OK and seems quite secure."
53745,2,"I purchased this twice! The first one I bought had a spring pin (under the mattress) fail. So, I took it back and got another one because I loved the concept. My under 40 pound daughter fell out of bed because yet another spring pin failed under the mattress. When I went back to check on her later in the night, the rail had failed again, only my daugher had not fallen out of bed yet. If the product does not keep the child in bed, what is the point?"
106978,1,"The only two concepts for a diaper pail are currently the diaper champ and the diaper genie. Obviously they both have their admirers and detractors - but the real question is can the pail be used for anything other than diapers?The diaper champ clearly wins out in that regard. What do you do with the used tissues, wipes, boxes of cream, plastic wrap from the various acoutrements you need for the baby? They are a pain to dispose of in the diaper genie, and besides they take up valuable plastic wrap - better used for the diapers themselves.Some other review talked about the lack of the champ to keep the smell down - this might be true, but no matter what product you use, there's always a hint of smell anyway. I put some baking soda and a sheet of BOUNCE (hint, hint) in the champ below the plastic bag - the smell was gone.All in all - the only reason I don't give five stars is because 13 gallon kitchen bags are just a touch too big for the container, and shopping bags from the supermarket are just too small. If there was a 7 or 10 gallon bag - that might be perfect."
108309,1,These are the best nipples for babies that I've ever seen. They are truly leak proof and I don't have to worry about my daughter getting formula in her ears..
70848,1,"Our daughter LOVED her bouncer, but she was getting frustrated at having to lay down lower to the ground in a seat. This rocking chair is the perfect next step if you still want a stationary seat for your little one that vibrates -- and it's just higher up for those infants who want to look around. Our sitter actually used it at her house to feed our daughter, so we bought one for home. She loves it -- we call it her 'chill chair' for when we want her to just relax. The vibrations still soothe her and the dangling toys keep her occupied. Since she can sit up on her own and we don't want the chair to flip forward, we keep the chair in the stationary position with the center bar folded out. If I'm staying very close by, I'll convert it into a rocker for her. Just use your common sense when it comes to having the chair be stationary vs. rocking. My daughter has been using it for the past 3 months (she's currently 7 months old) and I look forward to many more months of use!"
52811,2,"My husband and I bought this product for our son (our second large child). This is a wonderful product, however, I wish that the manufacturer would make it more likely to hold the ""average"" size child. We loved everything about this product -- except the size. Our son at 23"" and 14 lbs. at 10 wks. barely fits into this bouncer seat. We also discovered that the vibration will shut itself off which is great to have as an option but a pain when you have to continually restart it.I recommend this product for premies only. For average sized or larger infants, you're wasting your money because you'll be out buying a new bouncer in a few weeks.Note to Fischer-Price: MAKE IT BIGGER AND YOU'LL HAVE A HOME RUN ON THIS ONE! :)"
152899,2,"I bought this at the same time as a plug in car warmer. I used this exactly twice. Well, actually only once, because the second time when I went to use it, it was already activated and therefore useless. It's bulky and doesn't make good contact with the bottle, so the heat transfer is poor. I found it to only be useful to keep a warm bottle warm, and not to actually warm a cold one up. Boiling it to reset it is a pain. Not worth the money."
169127,1,My baby has been using pampers since she was born. It is not bad. at least no diaper rush. PooPoo easily leaks.
14824,2,"I agree with what I see a lot of people on here saying - these bottles LEAK! It's extremely frustrating, especially when you are expressing your own breastmilk and every drop is like liquid gold. I thought I was doing something wrong but then my husband and a coworker both complained to me at different times with different bottles (so it wasn't just one defective one). I'm going to return whatever I have that's not opened and get a different kind of bottle. This will teach me to read reviews first!"
121834,1,"I heard from a co-worker how great it was and how it saved her life after having her baby, so I bought this as a gift for my sister who was expecting. Since having her baby, she's been using it daily for 4 months now and have told me on several occasions how much she loves it. In addition, the father uses it as well. He uses it by placing the Boppy on himself while sitting, so that he can lay the baby on it and hold him comfortably as he sleeps. It's great and has multiple uses as shown in the product pictures, as described in product description, and as explained by other customers. Also, having extra covers is a must for spit-ups-- and eventually drools."
124156,1,"I recived one for a shower gift and had no clue this would be the one and only saving grace for my son!!!! He loves this thing, it is small enough he takes it everywere. I even bought 3 more because:)"
132654,2,"I'll say one good thing about this product: it's easy to use. For a while it seemed to control odor fairly well, but as my daughter got older and her waste got smellier, the Diaper Dekor showed its weakness. Her whole room smells like an outhouse. I've had enough, and am moving on to another product."
9855,0,Easy to use and removable tray for fast cleaning. I like it how it's portable. I also like the high backing which gives my kid the back support when using the potty trainer.
116647,2,"I think he meant Fony System, not Sony. These blew away your Fony system. Get it right dude."
174470,1,"My son is only 2 months old, but the music is very soothing. Having a seperate remote control is very handy. I place the remote on the door handle in my bedroom, so when the music starts I don't have to bother him. It is nice to be able to change the moving items to different faces and colors. From simple designs for little ones, to more detailed for older ones and soft faced animals for little grabbers - - love it. The soft faced animals are also nice to use outside of the mobile in a playpen, crib or stroller. When the little one gets too big for the mobile part, you can still use the music box to soothe."
140067,1,"It doesn't say this anywhere I could find, but when the product arrived it says, ""for dogs 17 lbs and under"". Too bad. We kept it but our 25 lb dog could probably easily topple this over. We reinforced it by putting some heavy stuff on both sides.There is a HIGH version of this we should have bought instead.Aesthetically, it is very nice."
122593,0,"I am 5'7"" and when I walk my daughter my feet hit the wheels. The arm handle does not adjust. My husband, who is 6'1"", can't comfortably stroll her at all.If you are planning on walking slowly, strolling through the mall, it is great. It turns on a dime and can get anywhere."
169365,0,"I don't have this and am thinking about getting it, but is this BPA-free? If you look on the bottom and see the recycling number, if it is 2, 4, or 5 it's BPA-free, if it's 1 or 3 or 7 it probably has BPA. I wish they listed what kind of plastic it is! If it is 7, polycarbonate, then it HAS BPA. Can someone help out?Thanks!"
40548,0,My local supermarket sells smaller packs for less per diaper. Aren't you supposed to save money by buying in bulk ... and from Amazon? Amazon's pricing is disappointing.
128044,1,"The Combi City Savvy All Weather is a great stroller for walks around the neighborhood or a quick trip to the mall. It's light weight and compact. The only problem I have is it can be a little hard to fold up at times. Other then that, it was a great buy and I highly recommend it to anyone!"
13999,2,"I used Playtex disposables for my first child, and I thought I would rather use reusable bottles for my next child. I bought these bottles because they were supposed to be the best on the market. Well, it turns out that my son is allergic to milk which causes him to be very gassy (even on hypoallergenic formula), and these bottles only seemed to make his gas and colic worse. They never leaked like so many others have complained about, but they sure did nothing to help with his gas and colic like they claim to do. He also spit up constantly while on these bottles. I'm angry to have spent so much money on a bottle system that I will now be donating to a second hand store, and I have to go in search of new bottles that will help with his gas."
97771,0,"I only use these bottles because my baby had alot of problems with gas on other bottles. This was the only bottle that would stop all the dicomfort my baby was in. However for me... I hate them. They leak all the time even with carefully putting them together, there are six pieces to each bottle (that means ALOT of cleaning), you can not steam sterilize the nipples and disks, you have to stretch the disk because the holes get stuck. The nipple colapse all the time and to fix I have to keep adjusting how tight the top is. The nipple has only two stages. With the stage 1 my baby doesn't get enough milk and gets fussy trying to suck so hard, the stage 2 gives to much milk and he acts like he is choking. So I had to open all the stage 2 nipples with a pin and now they are not all even but at least he can get the milk. But since I care more about my babies comfort then mine I stick with these."
74907,1,This gate works very well. It doesn't damage the doorway or paint. I would highly recommend this gate for anyone with pets or children.
121893,2,"I had hoped that this product would be more like a sleeping bag, when in reality, it is just a cover with a big open back. There was no closing mechanism on the back side (besides pushing against my body) and the hood kept falling down on my daughter's face.Tried it once, returning it.Looks cool, but not really functional."
25817,0,"The monitor is useful for white noise, the bear not so much. My 7 week old can't tell the difference yet, though he does like the soothing noise of nothing"
169314,1,"Overall we're pretty pleased with this product. Below is a list of the good and bad features of the product:The good:1. They're soft. Haven't had any rash problems.2. They're stretchy and seem to work well with a growing baby.3. They're really absorbent, especially for #1.4. For the most part, they don't leak. They do once in a while, but not nearly as much as other diapers out there.5. The indicator strip is nice. One takes it for granted after a while, but it makes me wonder how our parents got by.6. The ordering options here on Amazon are really convenient. For one thing the bulk package is nice. You can also subscribe and save. And of course it's always a bonus to get a big box delivered to your door. No more wrestling a large package out of the store and to the house.The bad:1. Really the only thing I don't like is the smell. The perfume odor is a little bit strong, as I think a few other reviewers have said. My opinion may be a little biased on this score, since I absolutely hate the smell of baby oil and can't stand most other perfumy products either. So take it as you may: I don't like it, but my wife does, and it doesn't seem to bother the baby."
153262,2,"I bought the baseball clock. Unfortunately, this clock is very loud. If you don't want to hear the loud ticking, then I recommend not buying this clock. It's a shame because it looks nice in a little boy's room."
45002,1,This toy was great since the day we brought home our new baby. She loved to look in the mirror at herself and the continuous music and sounds of the mat are great. Sometimes you really need to put her down and still have good visual and sound stimulation. This ROCKS!
18186,1,"My baby has loves this play gym. He loves that star and laughs when it lights up and plays music. He's figured out the motion sensor too and now loves it even more. We have a gymini as well, but he loves this play mat more."
62669,2,"Contrary to other reviewers, I prefer the Diaper Genie to both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Dekor, in part because of superior containment of smell. As one reviewer notes, there are a number of steps involved, but they're easy to learn, become second nature, and most importantly they *work*. We actually have to Genies, one of the earlier model and one of the purportedly ""new and improved"" Diaper Genie. The latter model, however, is not an improvement.The redesign allows the bag inside to be turned using the closed lid rather than by holding the bag on the inside. But the lid won't twist the bag if there's isn't much weight (at least 4 diapers or so) in it, which means it does a poorer job of containing the smell *and* occasionally makes a mess of the bag when you try to cut it (by pressing a button on the lid while twisting).The old design has one main problem: That inner ring that used to be used to hold and twist the bag, which is softer plastic, rubs against the bag/refill package, which is harder plastic. Over time (2 years, in our case) the bottom edge of the inner ring has worn and warped from collision and abrasion with the refill package, and has become quite difficult to enter. But I'm planning to sand it down a bit, which will probably resolve things - and THAT will be our preferred ""new and improved"" Genie."
14487,1,Avent bottles make switching from breast feeding to bottle feeding very easily. It was recommened by my lactation consultant as it is very similar to the breast. If u are bottle and breast feeeding at the same time.... I will highly recommend it. Had very less problems with gas and the bottles are very durable.
142613,1,"This is infinitely better than the Boppy which did not even fit over my post-partum belly.I took an inflatable ""My Brest Friend"" to the hospital with me and the lactation consultants commented that this was the best nursing pillow available. Unfortunately, I got it caught in the adjustable hospital bed and caused a leak. The first thing I did once I was home and able to use the computer was order this pillow.I used this pillow for every nursing session for the first few weeks. Now that my baby has some head control I sometimes use a regular pillow propped on the arm of my chair. However, I strap the My Brest Friend around me EVERY time my baby needs to nurse at night (when I'm not laying down). I keep this pillow by my bedside. I could prop the baby on regular bed pillows on my lap, but they are not nearly as comfortable as this pillow. If I fall asleep, the baby could roll into me and get his face buried between me and the pillows on my lap. This is virtually impossible with My Brest Friend. This nursing pillow is a firm but soft foam, the baby does not sink into it like a regular bed pillow. It is flat so that the baby will not roll off.I am a size 12/14/16 and the My Brest Friend fits perfectly. The waist belt is about in the middle for me . A somewhat larger or smaller person could use it with no problems."
13243,1,"We came across this product while shopping for a new carseat for my son. What a GREAT invention. The problem that we had encountered is that our CRV has a center seat belt that's not recommended for car seats. It won't tighten enough to hold the seat from moving around so we were forced to pick a side and put the seat there. I was not happy with this idea because, in an accident, I wanted him in the middle. This product has allowed us to put him in the center. Now, the belt is so tight around the seat that it hardly moves at all and we're all happier!! Thanks to my husband for finding it and thanks to the person who invented it!!!"
103147,1,Great product...just makes it a bit difficult if it is not a strip where plugs remain...to remove and then to put a power cord back in the strip takes some time but it serves it's #1 function to keep my toddler out of it and safe
117246,0,"Unfortunately, this purchase did not work out for us. The frame was bent and the handle was cracked upon shipping. Overall, the construction of the gate looks solid but the shipping box is on the flimsy side. I also found that the color of the gate did not meet my expectations. It is very orange/rust brown - especially the metal frame. If you are expecting a more natural wood look (Cherry, etc) this gate is not for you. However, assuming no damage upon arrival, the gate is functional -"
10145,1,I have tried several toilet seats and none seemed to work. This Babybjorn worked well. The raised area in the front could be a little taller but it is much better than the padded and unpadded seats we tried before. Overall this is a great seat with no areas for urine to hide and it's easy to clean and came with a toilet hanger so it's not in the way when he's not using it. My little boy is 2 and can up it on by himself.
100645,0,"I ordered these after my daughter came home from daycare wearing a pampers diaper, and I loved it. Unfortunaltey, this was not the diaper she came home in. These are plastic and are not worth the money. With the exception of the cute prints, they are exactly like luvs, but a lot more expensive. I like LUVS, but thats not what I wanted/paid for. Also, the diaper I loved so much was actually a pampers cruiser. Which I did end up ordering the next time around. they are like swaddlers...soft, more cloth like."
36130,0,Its nice and continent but i felt like i never used it right and it was awkward sometimes. I wish i had the other type of sling even though it takes more time to put on
140503,0,"We bought this swing for our second child after she developed colic and the travel, front to back swing just wasn't working for her. After a night of hours of crying, my husband sent me from the house to pick one of these up and I can say that overall, I am glad that we did buy this.First off, the swing is very cute and my daughter does love it. She doesn't sleep in it as much anymore, but is getting to the stage where she actually likes looking at the mobile on the swing. I also love that the mobile arm lifts up and out of the way, making it easier to get baby in and out. The price was a little much for me, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and colic makes purchasing a $[...] swing seem reasonable. The AC plug is also very convenient so I am not having to replace batteries once a week or more.Now on to the cons. I gave this swing only 3 stars because the music didn't even last 2 weeks on this thing. It gradually got quieter and quieter until the sound just died completely. And Fisher Price's solution for this was to buy a whole new motor section for the swing for 60-some odd dollars. Another thing that annoys me about this swing, and I don't know if it was a defect on mine but I doubt it, is that the arm holding the seat to the motor is off set, so when my daughter was lighter, every time she swung to the right, she would hit the frame bar. I could not run the swing at a very high speed at all with out the metal pieces clanking together.I am glad that we bought this swing because it did help my daughter with her fussiness, in turn allowing the rest of the family to sleep, but I was just so disappointed that something that cost so much had features that didn't hold up well at all. Be wary about the music box going out relatively quickly and hopefully Fisher Price might fix this problem."
59174,2,"I bought this warmer thinking it would help me with middle of the night feedings, but after testing it out once, I promptly returned it. I should have listened to the reviewers and not thought they were being petty. This thing has no auto shut off, the user has to set a timer for how long to leave the bottle in and even though there is an ""off"" switch, you still have to unplug the machine. Not very helpful at 2 in the morning when you are half asleep and have a frantic hungry baby. For the amount of money I paid, I would have expected much more than a glorified hot plate. I ended up getting the First Years version for less money and while that one is not perfect, it beats the Avent model. Too bad too, because I have been happy with the other products in this brand line."
179680,1,"I love this thing. It made flying with my 20 month old much easier. All you have to do is simply remove the wheels very easily.To go through security you have to remove the wheels, just the wheels. You don't have to unscrew the whole thing. It fits. You can attach it to the airplane and car seat too just by removing the wheels and leaving the rest of it attached.We love it and will use it again and again!"
120800,1,"I just installed this gate and it really only took a few minutes. I used both the side extensions that came with it and had no problems at all. I don't understand why anyone would have trouble with it, I only glanced at the instructions. I did not use the wall protectors because the mounting hardware doesn't look like it will damage the walls. It has soft cushion material on the part that touches the wall. You do have to adjust each of the four ""screws"" in order to get the gate just right for it to close on its own. In addition, if it is not tight enough you can just lift up on the gate to open it instead of having to use the button and then lift up. After only a couple minor adjustments, it worked perfectly. I am about to order two more just like it... :o)"
30377,0,"I was so excited about this tub, it was the main thing I wanted from our registry. It isn't that great. The button on the shower is so hard to push that I don't bother with it. and the spa option takes up so much room in the tub that I don't even have room for the baby!!!I use it with just the sling (which he slides down constantly)that is it."
48283,1,"I received this as a gift, not realizing how much I would really love it. My son is now 9 months and I have to say this is by far the best, most useful gift I received. It is great for those times when you want to check on your baby without disturbing them or when you know they are awake and want to let them hang out in their crib for a bit. It has made ""sleep training"" so much easier! Worth every penny!"
153097,1,"These bottles are great for pumping & storing. The removable disk in the cap is made of rubber, so there's a good seal, and you can take it out to put a nipple in. The shape is great because they're bigger at the base so stand up nicely.I have a medela freestyle pump that I'm using them with. They do fit, although if you bump the bottle, it can pop off, even when screwed on. The screw joints do not match tightly like Medela bottles. BUT, you can get 8 of these for the price of 3 Medela bottles, so they're a great buy. I'll use them when I pump at home and take the Medela bottles for pumping on the go."
173935,1,"My son loves this swing. He is 8 months old and has taken good long naps in it since we brought him home from the hospital. It is also great for Mom because baby is entertained in this swing by the mobile and the toy bar. So Mom has time to get a shower,do laundry, dishes ect. It is lightweight. I carry it from room to room with me. I am a first time Mom and this swing is the best baby item we have bought. If you are on a limited budget, this would be the one extra item I would buy."
54950,2,"The rocker was fairly easy to assemble and seemed sturdy. We gave this to our granddaughter on Christmas day. Unfortunately, one of the runners broke on the 29th after only 5 days of use! For $60 you'd expect a quality product, but not so with this child's rocking chair. Extremely disappointed with this purchase and would definitely not recommend anyone purchase it. I don't think it's safe for a child's use considering one of the rocking runners snapped in two creating a potential safety hazard to the child. Good thing an adult was present."
112507,1,"When we had our first baby everyone we knew told us we had to get Pampers Swaddlers and nothing else. Even though they were one of the most expensive diapers we gave in. While absolutely loving Swaddlers we tried a couple of others - Target brand, Huggies and LUVs - all were hard and leaky. When the time came to upgrade to size 3 (Swaddlers only go up to size 2) I went into detailed research. We bought a bag of Huggies and Pampers Cruisers and went through a week of thorough testing (lots of opportunities for leaks). While neither leaked, Huggies were very rough on our son and the snappers/velcro things gave him an instant rash. The ruffles around the legs to keep the leaks were also very loose and I was very surprised nothing actually leaked out. We then switched to Cruisers for a week and while they are not as soft and great-fitting as Swaddlers, they are BY FAR better than Huggies. Maybe we were spoiled from the beginning with the softness of Swaddlers, but we are now never going back, even though the Subscrive & Save deal is now over on Pampers. Though, oddly enough we just bought the same pack of 160 Cruisers at BRUs for $30.95 - I thought Amazon would be cheaper."
123778,1,"These diapers are by far the most hassle free cloth diaper. They dry quickly and the covers can be reused without a wash if they don't get anything on them. You can also quickly hand wash the cover and hang it up for a few hours to dry. To start, we bought 30 small prefolds and 6 newborn diaper covers. When she got a bit too big for the covers we bough 6 more size small covers. We have not yet had to purchase larger prefolds. I highly recommend these over any type of cloth diaper."
87976,1,"My seven week old son loves this gym. I know he won't use it for a very long time, but that is fine with me. There are very few toys he can enjoy at this age, but this is one of them. He loves to look at the black and white stripes and the bright patterns on the mat. He has just discovered the mirror and loves that, too!"
19273,1,"I purchased this for my baby girl to fit better in the car seat, in the hopes her head wouldn't fling forward so easily while I was driving and unable to reach her as quickly. This worked very well. Her head did still go forward, but not nearly as far as when I did not use this. I do live in Florida; however, and even the ""cool"" side made her quite warm during January-February. I feel it was a great purchase and well worth the small price for reassurance regarding the baby's head during the early weeks."
165983,1,My first t-fal product. Was impressed with the online videos about the product. It met my expectations when I have the product and love to use it.
103109,2,I bought this for my grandson. This product did not work out for us. The suction cups will not stick to a tub that has a non slip surface on the bottom. Both tubs at my house and my son's house have non slip surfaces (rough bottom). We're hoping to donate this to someone who can use this.
111210,0,"i like to wash all my things before wearing it -- especially when it comes to baby related items. the tag states that this nursing cover is ""100% cotton, slight shrinkage may occur"". but to my surprise, it didn't shrink slightly -- it shrunk half its size! I washed as directed so i don't know what had happened. i'm very disappointed.update:amazon sent me a replacement and the new nursing cover shrunk about an inch after washing and drying as directed. so much better than the first one! thanks amazon for the replacement!"
184542,1,"This is probably the MOST useful product that I own. My son is now 3 and we still use it every time we are in a store. He has been able to undo the buckles on shopping carts for a long time, but he can't get out of this because of the extra large velco haolding him safe. I love it!"
174660,0,"After I spent all that money, I was told that some women can't pump too much even though they produce a lot of milk. Of course just to make me angry, I wasn't pumping much (even though I am making enough milk). That is why i recommend that before you buy such an expensive pump, try to use a cheap manual pump to see how it works first."
178142,0,"Fairly sturdy and inexpensive. We enjoy the dark wood. While assembling, one of the screws didn't reach into the pre-prepared holes with the receiving hardware inside. The table is still sturdy though. We like it."
25303,2,"This is a very cheaply made product, and wouldn't lie flat against the seat-- a corner would always stick up oddly. If I forced that corner down, the opposite corner would just pop up instead. I tied it in place possibly every conceivable way, but it kept coming untied at the bottom anyway, and would not stay still. You know that wire and thin material manufacturers use for things like pop-up tents and cheap hampers? This is like that. My 2-year-old seemed to think it was a fun game to try to kick it off.Anyway, I recently gave up and threw ours away. It was more trouble than it was worth."
136894,0,"It is great for the first few months. My toddler(2years old) tried it once and bent it, so now once side is higher than the other. I love the different positions but there isn't one for sitting up straight and now that my baby wants to try it, she can't do it.Over all it is nice, it just lasted 3 months."
158233,1,"Looking over the other post, I have to say- I never used this for a sling, except to play with friends baby- which I mention below. We use it as a hip carrier and love it. I am only 5'4 and had a lot of extra strap so I have put 3 layers of stap through the adjustment slide....I don't see how that could loosen, but out of habit I check it before each use. I would not want it to loosen. My friend and I tried her 6 week old in mine as a sling and he was so happy, but again she is short and the excess was through the adjuster.Hope this information helps you- we are so happy with ours!"
120679,1,"Our daughter used these as burp rags at first. Then, she began to use them as security blankets. Now, at two years, she still carries one around with her. We also keep one in her bed. These are great, because you don't have to worry about losing a precious blankie. They all look and feel the same, so if one is misplaced, there is always another to take its place. We'd be in trouble without them!!"
80838,1,"I like the diapers. They are soft and flexible. However, did not know 3T/4T is size 5 equivalent. I was using Size 6 for my daughter and got 3T/4T trainers. After opening I realized that it is size 5 and am left with a box of diapers which is small for her."
14581,1,"I love the Avent bottles. My daughter has been using them for over five months now. She was breastfed while I was on maternity leave, but needed breastmilk in bottles when I returned to work. She has never had any problems. I love that the bottles come with covers to convert them into containers. I use the small ones now for her food. I also love that the sippy cup attachments fit the bottles as well. Very durable, easy to clean."
9429,0,"I think what makes this potty work well for my twins is the high arms. They like to sit on it and started the day it arrived. Also, it arrived in one day. But they fought over the right to sit on it and I was made to buy a second one. I have them in white and blue.There is something about this potty that makes a little one understand its purpose. I couldn't believe how comfortable they are for them sitting on it, due to the arms and back and overall design. I think the price was favorable and feel great about the purchase of these two potty chairs.They're right now in the early stages of learning. We'll be using these for awhile I expect."
173301,1,"We recently discovered that we could hear our neighbors on the baby monitor, which meant that they could hear us. This digital monitor solved that problem. It also has a nice feature - it is rechargeable, which means no more changing batteries. Good signal and clarity. Works everywhere in the house."
32482,0,"This gate was very easy to install and is very sturdy once installed. It is somewhat difficult to open since you have to press a little button, and pull the lever up in order to swing gate open. It also has a rail across the bottom that we trip on constantly - I assume that the rail is there to add stability."
176890,2,"This is a waste of money. Not only that it takes much longer to warm up a bottle with this awful thing then it would be with simple putting in hot water, but when it does go through its cycle, the bottle either still cold or too hot. I followed all the instructions, my husband read the instructions, my friends read the instructions, and we seem to do it right. But its just not working out for us."
16824,1,"My granddaughter is a wiggler when she sleeps and this extra long bed rail keeps her from falling off of the bed. I had tried others and she always managed to wiggle to the end of the bed. Because this rail is longer than others, she stays put. It's also very safe as it has no bars, slats or rails. Very satisfied buyer!"
86887,1,"I have tried so many bottles. Really, Avent, Soothie, Mam, Ventaire, Dr. Browns, Gerber, Evenflo, and Born Free: from the cheapest to some of the most expensive.These are not perfect but they are what worked the best.Pros:-wide nipple, baby preferred-cleaned easily-had few parts-could be warmed in a bottle warmer or hot water-didn't need special tricks to keep from leakingCons:-had to buy liners-measurements could be betterI got over buying the liners in two ways: I started recycling my liners and I started using the Playtex flat liners available here on Amazon which helped the cost a lot. I can buy 5 months supple of liners (5 bottles a day) for less than $30 shipped/taxed.The measurements are still not great but since I premix every day's formula in a large pitcher the night before, I don't have to have the exact measurements. I know now from practice at about where on the liners the milk needs to go."
142280,1,"I have been using my carrier for my 2 month old and I love it. She is very comfortable in it and loves to look around. It feels snug and secure, no back or neck pains, but she is still only around 13 pounds. The only thing I don't like about the design are the three staps that just hang in the front. Seems like a lot of extra material that needs to be cliped or tied somehow. Otherwise, a great product at a great price on Amazon."
31684,2,"The brush works well while it lasts, but is now broken after two months of use.This is my second one and the wire that holds the brush in place bends and breaks, I will not be buying a third."
84477,1,The Fisher-Price Infant To Toddler Swing in Red is a wonderful swing. My granddaughter just loves her swing and we have spent many happy hours using it.It is sturdy and safe for her little arms and legs and she can relax and so can grandma. The safety strap is very easy to adjust and snap closed. The tray provides a comfortable place for her to rest her little hands while grandma pushes against the back of the swing. It is well balanced and moves easily. We just love our Fisher-Price Infant to Toddler Swing in Red
172119,1,"I bought and brought home 3 different tubs. After reading reviews, I took each of them back. I ended up with this tub and it was a great choice. The sling made it really easy to bathe my newborn. It gave him a sense of security (and me as well). Now that he is 2 months, he likes to sit in the laid back position. He has plenty of room to kick and splash in the water. It is also really easy to clean (just a quick rinse and I flip it over to dry). Great product!"
67920,2,"My son didn't really like the toys. He wasn't interested and couldn't reach them. However, he really like the lil pillow at the top. So he naps on it now. (2 months old)"
184363,0,"I got this so I could nap with my newborn in the bed - there are a lot of tabs and folds that I am not sure how to use, but my biggest complaint is the toxic smell it emits - like plastic. This can't be good for me or baby. I hope it airs out soon, before baby outgrows this sleeper. Otherwise, it's a sturdy design for the price and works well if you want to sleep next to your little one without fear."
46178,0,This Messymat is very nice. BUT I thought it was of a heavy vinyl that would stay put and be easy to clean and stay put. This is not the case with the Messymat. If you don't care that it is lightweight and hard to put down then go for it because it is nice. As I said this is probably my error for not reading or seeing the contents.Thank you
110406,2,THIS ITEM IS TOO SMALL. I KEPT PUTTING IT ON THE BACK WINDSHIELD BUT IT KEPT FALLING DOWN EACH TIME. I COULD NOT SEE MY BABY IN THIS TINY MIRROR. NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL.
35470,1,"while you may not consider this product a ""necessity""-it definitely makes your child a little bit happier while shopping (which means you get some extra time in the store!) it's durable and easy to wash! i really didn't consider it at all until someone gave it to us as a gift-had i known how much happier my pumpkin would be in a store-i would have bought one myself months ago!"
114444,1,We got this booster for my son when he was 10 months old for Grandmas house since we eat dinner there almost every day. We love it no complaints at all. Fits all size chairs the size and height are great. My son is a big tall boy and still fits in it no problem at 16 months. He even plays with it when he's not eating the loves the seat belts locking and unlocking them. The different tray combo is great and the cover keeps it from getting dusty. Very comfortable we've taken it out with us many times to different restaurants and it worked great. Great buy for the money.
119652,0,"We have a lot of issues with the sound quality. I hear tons of static and a constant tapping noise. The piece of the monitor that you carry around also falls down easily. It needs a sturdier flatter surface. The light show is less than entertaining. The monitor looks good, sounds bad."
123891,0,"This car seat is very easy to install and is very comfortable for my son. The only thing I don't like about it stands so erect that is difficult for the child to sleep in it very comfortably. Also, there is no padding on the each side of the head rest to keep the child's head from flopping about."
142245,0,"Over the course of three children we have had FIVE carriers: Two slings, a Baby Bjorn, a Snugli and the Ergo Baby.The Bjorn is definitely the best looking and easiest to use. The clips and connectors are very intuitive and it's easy to get smaller infants into it.My big complaint is that when the kids get larger (or if you wear it for more than 20 minutes at a time) it really starts to kill your back. This is because the design keeps all the weight on your shoulders. It's like wearing a backpack BACKWARDS!The ""Active"" version has wider straps which provide additional support for a small improvement over the ""Original,"" but it still puts all the weight on your shoulders, pulling them forward.If you only plan to use this when grocery shopping and think you'll give it up when they're 6 months old, this might be for you. If you think you might want to go to the park and hang out, or use it even when the kid starts to crawl, then the Ergo Baby is probably more your speed.p.s. this is coming from a guy who is 6', 180# and fit. My wife is smaller and far more critical of the ergonomics of this carrier.If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!"
108028,2,"I registered for this pump because I planned to be at home with my daughter for approximately one year, so I didn't think I needed a mechanized pump. The pump works fine if you are ready to go (engorged and have that let-down sensation), but if you're not, you're going to have to work to get the milk to flow with this pump. The pump is fairly slow and, while powerful for a manual pump, isn't powerful enough for frequent pumping. Plus, you can only pump one breast at a time, which is really, really slow and can make somewhat of a mess with your other breast leaking. Eventually I rented a mechanical pump that I LOVED (the Medela Pump in Style) and couldn't believe I spent all that time with the Avent Isis.This pump is also kind of a pain to clean because there are so many parts (the hard plastic breast shell, the gel part to the shell, and the two valve parts) that have to be taken apart, cleaned and sterilized after every use. The Medela Pump in Style was much easier to clean--just the hard plastic shells after every use.Finally, I have to warn about the possible risk posed to your hands and/or wrists from repetitive use of this product. I was only pumping one time a day at most (to save up for date nights, or for the other rare times I wasn't around to nurse my daughter), but I developed tendinitis in the tendon connecting my thumb to my wrist. It was very painful and eventually led to me having a steroid injection (ouch). Once I stopped using this pump and started wearing a wrist brace, the problem resolved."
137033,1,This is such a cute set. I love the green gingham fabric. My Granddaughters room is looking amazing.
174042,2,"I was so exited about this swing for my lil baby girl,I wanted it in the worst way...Well I am so very disapointed...We recieved it as a gift for my baby shower,So of course being a new Mommy I wanted the thing Put together the second I got home!LOL!At first,Before my daughter was born,The swing sounded and acted GREAT.Then when she was about 4 months old we started hearing wierd sounds coming from it,Like a loud clunk I thought that the motor might have been blown.Then the swing will make noise like it's on,But the stupid thing won't even swing!so my daughter gets upset and starts crying,I can't say that I blame her,A SWING that doesn't SWING??HUH??Another thing is I would go to shut the swing off,When my daughter was sleeping to pick her up to put her to bed,Well the music would turn on!Wake her up...I guess the over all review would be, DON'T BUY THIS OR GIVE AS A GIFT TO ANYONE!!!!Also it chews through batterys!!!!"
102833,2,"I work at a daycare and we use the &quot;oderless&quot; diaper pail. First of all, we empty the pail every night and it still smells awful. And when you're holding a baby in one arm and a diaper in the other hand, it's hard to press the &quot;childsafe&quot; button which lifts the lid. Also, the older toddlers are easily able to open the pail...it's not so child-safe. I would not recommend this for anyone!! I'm pregnant and due in December...we're going with the Diaper Dekor."
34696,1,"I use the Playtex Drop-Ins bottle system to feed my baby, so I needed a better and safer alternative than boiling to sterilize the nipples and such.I chose this particular steam sterilizer, since it seemed to be the easiest to use, it got good reviews and would work for what I needed it for.I like this a lot, it saves time and sterilizes like it's supposed to.The things that I don't like is that it's not large enough to fit the bottles (I thought it was a lot larger and was kind of disappointed at how small it was when it arrived), only the caps, nipples, closing rings, pacifiers and other small items. It doesn't have a drying feature, so like with boiling, I have to wait till everything cools down and air drys before I can use anything."
115786,0,"Love the look and feel of the stroller. I have the tangerine model.But oh my back... Im male, 5'10"" on a good day, and do most of the pushing when we are out and about. I cant stress enough that it isnt designed for someone of my height, which isnt all that tall. I have begun to prefer my larger mclaren techno just for my chiropractor's sake.On huge plus about the height is that my son, who is 2 1/2, can push it himself and see where hes going (w/o the canopy). thats definitely worth something."
183843,1,"Great that they offer this all together. I paid less than $15 for it, which is a great deal. You'll pay more if you get them all separate. It comes with smaller snack size containers & lids, then ones that are a bit bigger. All comes in a tot like bag, so they aren't all just thrown in a box and shipped."
21249,2,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!My son loved this swing, worked great for a colicky infant but after only 10 weeks the motor died. I thought it was the batteries I tried replacing the batteries several times with no success. This product is definately not worth it's expensive price, although it's beautiful in design the workmanship is not!! SAVE YOUR MONEY OR YOU WILL END UP SPENDING MORE!!!!"
90076,1,"My twin girls are Pampers ladies. The Baby Dry fits and with the decreased SAPs compared to Dry Max whenever they have slight cases of diaper rash, it remains a slight case. If your kids get diaper rash when on antibiotics or other meds, then not having the higher concentration of SAPs helps their rears. Along with taking a probiotic of course. CHEAPEST place to get the best.! It's a no brainer.."
38513,1,"After using a hard plastic infant tub and a infant-to-toddler tub (both expensive for the purpose) I found this bath pillow! I had imagined something like this as being the perfect way to bathe a newborn/infant but thought the yellow sponge pillow you can buy for $4 was too flimsy. This is perfect! It really does hold in the warm water, is so soft that you feel good bathing a little one in it, my babies found it soothing, and it conveniently hangs to dry in the bathtub! We had no problems with slow drying or mildew/mold. I insist you buy this for yourself or for a friend! You'll love it, and more importantly, your baby will too!"
166523,1,"I've always loved pampers and this was such a great deal so I jumped on it. Everything came and all was good, but it took 2 weeks for the shipment to get to my home. In that time I had to buy another pack of diapers. All of my other amazon shipments usually only take a few days, maybe a week. I just do.t understand why this one took so long. Besides that things were fantastic."
131535,0,"When I began potty training my two year old I stocked up on the goods. I got a travel potty (GREAT!) star chart, etc... I popped this thing in my purse a few times... but it is so un nessesary. I probably wouldn't buy this again. BUT... it held up very well, fit all toilets, and if you need a potty seat for traveling longer term then it's worth it (but don't be lame like me and bring it into the grocery store with you). Doesn't pintch and the treds keep it in place."
53528,0,"We had a Kettler Kids Dining seat for our first daughter then passed that on to friends and then had another surprise child :) We picked up another hanging seat. For sure these are absolutely better than standard high chairs. Leaves lots of floor space and it's easy to use, and bring with you on road trips. We brought that seat around with us EVERYWHERE. It's convenient to have a seat we could put our daughter in to amuse herself for a bit in a hotel room where she will be out of trouble.We picked up this chair since they no longer carry Kettler. I have to say, this is lower quality than I expected after having the Kettler for the same price as this thing. I have a laundry list of beefs about this seat compared to Kettler.CONS:-It's made from a light padded slick dark nylon. Others seem to be made out of thicker material that feels like 'canvas', but is made of nylon for washing. This has two bad properties, one it holds water in the 'padding'. Two, it shows food unfortunately well, and it will collect food.-The sewing is of mediocre quality, for instance the seams are starting to open and the strap stitching is already pulling away and we have only just now started using the straps since our daughter is standing up now in the seat. Maybe it's just a side effect of the thin padded nylon material.-The bottom of the seat is made of something that feels like particle board, no way to remove it for washing. Needless to say it's disintegrated by now.My biggest beef is that no matter how tight you make the straps, it won't hold medium to small children down. They can just put their arms under and stand right up. Maybe it's just our kid, but the straps on other chairs seem a lot more restrictive. Also due to poor stitching quality it's starting to unravel (see sewing note above).PROS:Pockets in the back.Easier to take apart and clean than the Kettler.Easier to attach and detach because it 'gives' more than the sturdier kettler.I think it has a larger clearance than the kettler to hook on 'under' table skirts too.SUMMARY:It's a LOT cheaper (Quality and price wise) than the only other real competitor at the moment, the Chico. So if you aren't sure you want a hanging seat or need a temporary 'beater', this is a great choice. FSS Shipping absolutely makes this a solid choice.However if you KNOW you like hanging seats, pony up for the next price up. I am going to try the Chico next since Kettlers are so hard to find."
87090,1,"Highly recommend! This product is so easy to use and lightweight, great for travel. Not only does it have the perfect amount of shade, but makes for a cozy sleep environment too!"
106318,1,The biggest selling point for me was the fact you use your own trash bags. This product is very easy to use. We did have a problem with the foam seal coming off but this was due to us trying to shove more diapers in an already full pail! It did not keep the diaper pail from continuing to work properly and we never smell a thing as long as we get the diapers in there pronto. My mom debated with me on this one and I'm really glad I bought it.
38159,1,"I have been looking for an insulated bag large enough for my lunch and a couple of snacks. Most of the products out there are way too big for my needs. In fact, we already have one of the smallest ones I could find at the local big-box store (6-pack can cooler size) and I thought I would try to use that first. It was laughable, how empty it was. I was actually able to fit a week's worth of lunches in it with plenty of room to spare.This one may be too small for some people, but it is perfect for me. Today, I loaded it up with a 17oz Myoplex protein shake, a very large apple, a small Rubbermaid container of pistachios (probably 1/2 cup), two string cheese sticks, one jerky stick, 1/2 cup of granola and there is still a little room left. I could probably do another 1/2 cup of granola, or nuts, or another (slightly smaller) apple as well as several more cheese sticks or jerky sticks.I am not sure how it would do with sandwiches, but I suspect that if they were cut in half (rectangular, not triangular), I could fit 1 or 2 in there, in place of the apple and Rubbermaid container. Bananas may also be tricky. It looks like they might fit ok, but it will be close, because of the odd shape.It appears to be very well made and I love the convenience of tossing the bag in the freezer, instead of using those ice packs, which are never the right size for the cooler anyway.So, if you are looking for a smaller lunch bag that will keep everything cold, check this one out."
111915,2,"We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates. Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates. Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom. This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't.)"
135009,0,"We have been the biggest supporters/fan club for this stroller for a while, but I have now changed my tune. I guess you get what you pay for. The front seat broke within the first ten uses of this stroller (newborn tripet passengers). We sent the item back to BabyTrend, and they were very helpful, fixing the seat. Well now, that same front seat is broken again, this time irreparably, I am afraid. My tripets are 16 months old and the middle seat is VERY tight (my smallest child is 22 lbs.) so we were considering going to a different stroller. Well, after this last problem with the seat, we are definitely going to switch. I am not sure that any of the in-strollers will have room in the middle seat, but we have to literally squeeze my little one in there!"
62756,0,"This has been a great tool for us. We actually bought two of them (in 2002). One for the upstairs nursery and one next to the pack-n-play downstairs. My child is a toddler now, so we use the toddler refills and it smells only when you open it and there is a really stinky diaper in there too long. I empty both of ours once a week. The two complaints I have are:1. the cutter doesn't always work. Sometimes I end up using scissors.2. after you empty it, you have to put the 2nd and 3rd diapers in just right or they fall into the pod of the 1st diaper. It's not that big of a deal, but it creates more stink!Other than that, it has been a great help!"
154808,1,"I have things shipped to and through a secondary shipper to our home in South America and for some reason we don't see Vaseline here. It's a great product for skin, small injuries, cuts, etc. and even a for a little grease on hardware if needed. Shipped quickly."
40437,2,I bought a new box a cruisers and notice right away there was no mesh liner anymore. I have a 9 month old and has always used pampers. I used to love the cruisers but now the new diapers are not as soft and they leak. I suppose Pampers found a way to cut costs.
168818,1,What to describe about Pampers as they are Good. Definitely recommend to any one to buy this product. Thanks to Pampers.
90009,0,"These diapers are ok for the price. We've thankfully never had a poo leak, but these will leak urine if left on longer than a couple of hours. Forget about even trying to use them overnight! I made the mistake of putting one on my son before he went to bed and he woke up in the middle of the night screaming because he was soaked. Luvs are cheaper and seem to hold liquid better. I'd probably choose those over the Pampers Baby Dry, but we will use up the ones we have left since they are just fine for daytime wear, when the child will be changed more frequently."
55414,0,"I guess this is supposed to have a shut off component to keep the bottle from getting too hot but mine does not work. Also the ""ready light"" stays on all of the time. In order to stop it, I have to unplug it. If I leave the bottle in there, the formula will be scalding hot. I actually have to stand over it, pull the bottle out from time to time and check the temperature. Now that I can guesstimate the time I need to leave it in there, it is much better. It heats well and I may purchase another one for the nursery. Hopefully the next one will work a little better."
16539,2,We received this as a gift. We took it out of the box and put it together when we were doing our nursery. We tested it a couple of times and it worked fine. Now our baby girl is due anyday and it doesn't work. The gears inside are all jammed up so we can't even use it manually. We can't take it back because we don't have the box anymore and we received it as a gift so we don't have a receipt. We are just glad that we received it as a gift---and not wasted our own money on it.We are very upset that we didn't even get to use it.
160436,1,"Even though he's young for potty training, we thought we would get him used to the idea with the hopes that it might make the transition easier when the time comes. He loves it and has fun pointing to Elmo on the seat. It's very soft and easy to clean. Great buy!"
151109,0,"Most of the time, when my daughter was awake she seemed very squished in this sling. A few times I was able to lay her down in it and let her sleep but for the most part she seemed uncomfortable. She is six months now and I hope I can get some more use out of it for when I need to carry her on my hip but overall I think I could have lived without it."
16638,1,"I first read all of the reviews online about this stroller. After going to the store to find that the stroller we firt registered for was discontinued, I went back to the drawing board. My wife and I saw the Cortina system and were very impressed. Being first time parents, I did my research. All of the reviews that I read on this were right on. The ease of use, the large storage basket that is very easy to get eveything in and out of and the overall use of the stoller. The travel system works great. The car seat works great for our new arrival who was only 6 pds when we left the hospital. I rate this product an A++. High quality all around. The best purchase we have made yet!"
66743,0,"Trolley is ok, but from the time of purchase for two years we had to deal with a few things on the technical side. I recommend this stroller to very flat surfaces only."
130711,1,"My daughter loved this swing! We used it until she was 7 months old. She would take long naps in it using the cradle feature. She loved the lights and the music. I don't think it swung too fast. My daughter was heavier than the average baby, if it went too slow she wouldn't of been able to use it at all. It was perfect. My advice to the person who has to keep pusing it every two minutes is to let a blanket drag on the floor...that will slow it down."
131427,1,"The product is nice. Surface is anti-skid, holds car seat very well and fits in the car nicely.I did not find any issues with chemical odor and stains like some reviewers reported.Would recommend to anyone interested."
146619,1,"Our daughter is only 3 months old but has excellent muscle control and loves to push up with her legs so we were searching for a jumper thinking it would help tire her out while building muscle and entertaining her. We finally decided to buy this based on all the great reviews. Our daughter loves the music and lights as well as looking up at the parrot and frog hanging on the leaves. The only disappointment is that even though she is about 15lbs and over 24"" tall, her feet don't touch the floor even on the lowest setting. Like some other reviewers, we have to fold up blankets underneath or sit with her and let her push off of our hands. Overall though, it's good and we're looking forward to the day she really grows into it!"
139689,1,"This is awesome. Even the adults love it. It creates such a soothing atmosphere with the stars lit up on the ceiling and walls. The only thing I'd change is that I'd offer it in different colors, since I bought it for a newborn girl's room. A nice pink would have been nice. But it really is a great product!"
43613,1,"If you are having trouble with the footrest flipping up, call the company's 800 number. They heve redesigned the sling to correct this problem, and will ship you a new model for free! Our replacement arrived in just a few days, and works great."
112513,1,this product is much better than other products. i do not have any problem with leaking. my babies (2years and 10 months) can move well and sleep well.
128168,1,"This lightweight umbrella stroller has made it soooo much easier to get around out in public with two small children under the age of two. I was concerned about shopping and doctors appt. since it is side by side but we fit in all door jams and it actually has made shopper and doctor visits easier. Also, the stroller folds up nicely to fit in the back of my grand cherokee. I can't wait for winter to be over to enjoy long walks outside with my two year old and eight month old daughters. I am very pleased with this product. Not only is it light weight, easy to maneuver, it's also pink! Buy it buy it!!"
133824,0,"1. I would consider the ""white pique"" to be a waffle fabric, not pique.2. It says that you can hand wash if you remove the bottom insert, but it feels like the top part of the stacker is a piece of corrugated cardboard sewn between two pieces of fabric. I don't think it would hold up to a single washing.3. The picture for white pique shows a single tie in the center. Mine came with two ties on the outer edges.4. This works much better when you hang it from a closet rod or towel bar. If you try to hang it flat against a wall, the bottom is not level. The front and back are equal lengths of fabric and both sides are designed to spread out from the top in an ""A"" shape.I'm going to keep this because it was cheap and the only white diaper stacker I could find. I really wish I could hang it from the wall and wash it, though."
181856,1,"I love the product. It just gets better &amp; better by the year. I have two children of my own. One of them is 5yrs. old and the other is 3yrs. old,and I continue to use your product on them.Now,I will use it on my godchild.Thank you for continueing to add more productes to you line of productes."
170424,1,"My son began using the Marathon when he was 5-weeks old. He is now a little over 3-years old and is still in it. My little guy is big- nearing 50 lbs. and well over 3-feet tall and he still fits in it comfortably and, most importantly, he is safe!If you're considering this car seat (or another Britax model) I encourage you to take a look at how it's made versus seats made by other manufacturers. Britax car seats are sort of made like a bicycle helmet in that there is a lot of Styrofoam, foam padding, etc. so that if (Heaven forbid) you're in a car accident, the seat will take the brunt of the impact- not your child.My son is comfortable in it both now and when he was an infant. Plus, the seat cover has worn beautifully (my cover is made of the same material but a different color) and, believe me, it has been washed a lot! I wash it at night (using the hand wash cycle on the machine) and let it hang to dry- by the next morning it's ready to go.The LATCH system on this car seat is so easy to use because each side has it's own strap which makes installing it a piece of cake.This car seat is larger than most so if you have a smaller car, you might want to make sure it fits before you purchase it, especially if you're going to use it rear facing. Babies 'R Us will usually allow you to test the floor model before you make a purchase.I read that one reviewer had problems with her child messing with the harness adjuster- I did too, but it was easily rectified. I used a diaper pin on the underside of the cover so that my son couldn't get to the lever. No big deal. It was a phase that came and went. He was two at the time and it was nothing more than a big game to him. It's not an issue anymore.I really love this car seat (and my Roundabout and my Parkway Express Booster). I know that Britax is pricey but the seats are worth every penny because I truly believe that I've got my children in the safest car seats on the market."
587,1,i am very satisfied with pampers. it's the only diaper i used for my other kids and still using it.
115283,1,"I thought I was being smart and proactive when i taught our toddler to go down stairs on her bottom at an early age - about 1 yr. Now that she is 2, I bought this gate specifically to go at the top of the stairs so she doesn't wander off unannounced and throw us into a panic!The directions were easy enough to follow and it installed fairly easily. One challege we encountered was the height of the wall at the top of the stairs in our raised ranch. We have a half wall on one side that opens into our living room, and the gripper on that side is actually on the wood trim rather than the wall itself.That said, it works fine, we just tightened it extra hard on that side so it doesn't slip.The only issue I do have is that the gate needs constant adjustments so that it will close by itself as it is designed to do. When the baby bangs on it, or grabs the bars and shakes them like she has seen too many prison movies (let me out! you hear me, warden?? LOL)it throws the balance off just enough so it won't latch. And needless to say, our jailbird is anxious to exploit any opportunity to run for it!Worth the money, attractive and sturdy - just need to pay constant attention... and that defeats the purpose of buying a self-closing gate."
33568,1,"Let me first start by saying I am not a connoisseur of baby items. I've never assembled a carriage, crib, high chair, or anything of the like. In fact, I have no children. We bought 3 of these gate for our 6 week old Schnauzer puppy. She likes to explore rooms she shouldn't be in.After reading all the reviews, I was nervous about receiving these but couldn't beat the price. I just cracked open all 3 boxes and installed all of them in under 5 minutes. The gate is sturdy and the locking mechanism is easy to understand. And this coming from someone who has never used a baby gate. Plus, our house is far from plumb and the gate locked pretty snugly--no wiggle room. It is stationary, so if you remove it, you will have to re-find the right notch for the latch to go in. But is this really a big deal? No. Just mark the notch with a Sharpie and the next time you go to use it, you will know where to place it.I'm not quite sure why everyone else gave this a low rating. Maybe they've made this product better since then??? Dunno.For $13, you get a gate to block unwanted shorties from getting into rooms they should've be in. No frills but gets the job done for us. Overall I'm very happy we got these."
142218,1,Great product. None of the other hikers on our vigerous trail could believe that our baby was so happy as we hiked throughout Kauaii recently. Unfortunately the material can get a bit warm against your body. Also I still think that the lumbar support could be better.
31507,1,"We started with the Munchkin drying rack, but quickly outgrew it once we got more bottles into rotation (along with pacifiers, pump equipment, etc.). It only gets 4 stars because it does feel a bit flimsy and the trays don't spin as nicely as I'd hoped. That said, it does hold quite a lot of items and I would buy it again (heck, we might end up buying another, as we still have more items than will fit on this rack!)."
149733,1,I JUST WANTED TO WRITE AND TO TELL PEOPLE THAT I LOVE THIS STROLLER.I JUST RECEIVED IT TODAY AND I TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX AND IT WAS SO EASY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPEN IT. I SEARCHED AND SEARCHED BEFORE DECIDING ON THIS ONE. I ORDERED 3 OTHER KINDS AND CANCELLED THEM AND THEN FINALLY ORDERED THIS ONE. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY SELECTION. I HAVE A GRACO DOUGLIDER AND I FELT LIKE I WAS DRIVING A BUS. THIS ONE IS SO LITE IT IS EASY TO MANUVER AND EASY TO CLOSE UP. IT'S WINTER HERE IN MINNESOTA AND I CAN'T WAIT TILL IT WARMS UP SO I CAN USE MY NEW STROLLER MORE. I LOVE THE FACT THAT EACH SIDE HAS ITS OWN ADJUSTABLE SEATS AND THE CANOPYS ARE FAIRLY BIG BUT I WENT AHEAD AND BOUGHT A SUN SHADE THAT EXTENDS. IF YOU ARE A MOM OF MULTIPLES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS STROLLER STAY AWAY FROM THE FRONT AND BACK ONES WAY TOO MUCH TROUBLE TRUST ME.
28265,1,"Only took 10-20 minutes to assemble with no trouble. I'm 6'7"" 240lbs and the chair supports my size and weight very well. I find it to be very comfortable and my wife who is 5'2"" absolutely loves it."
23364,1,"This is the best diaper pail I have ever purchased and boy let me tell you I have been through more then I can count. I love this diaper pail so much I bought more then one. There's no smell at all from it (however I do suggest using scented garbage bags, and yes that's the best part, you can use a garbage bag!), changing the filter, bag, batteries, is not hard at all, and I think over all it's an easier system then all the other brands out there. I'm very happy with mine!"
90994,1,Our little one (now 2yo) has been in the 95 percentile for weight since birth. These have been great for us
11202,1,"I was just a little perplexed, but quickly figured out how to setup this Pack 'n Play, break it down and move it to another location in the house. It's very sturdy and useful with its changing bed, and higher bed for our daughter's newborn. I am older and it's easier for me with this play yard to work with my grandchild when babysitting."
54402,1,"My 3 month old loves this mobile &amp; has since he was about 2 months old. The only problem with it is when the items slide down the bars as it rotates, it makes a lot of noise. He will not fall asleep because of this noise. The bright colors mixed with the black &amp; white are great for baby's developing eyes. This mobile keeps him entertained for quite a while."
64010,1,"My daughter is almost 6 months old and slept through the whole night wearing her new Swaddleme. She normally wakes up frequently because she kicks off her blankets. But last night, she didn't wake up once! I'm definitely going to get another one these!"
116292,0,"works ok to keep your toddler from opening the sliding doors, but thats it, when the lock is in the ""open"" position there is nothing to keep it compleatly vertical so it will drop down some so that you cannot close the door with out something to slide between the doors to hold it up enough to close the door, if only they had drilled a hole in the top to hold it in the ""open"" postion to..... or mabie i put mine in upside down..."
96886,1,"No better ""heart felt"" shower gift for a first time mother-to-be than the sound of a heart beat! The ""Cloud Sleep Sheep"" was joyfully received. I hope it does the job to sooth baby."
165962,2,"We started off with the Pampers Swaddlers, and I bought these ones by mistake. Since I had them, and the reviews were quite good, I decided to keep them. They claim to have an 'ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection', but my baby is 10 lbs (size 1 is for 8-14lbs), and after about 5 hours, she had actually leaked through and out onto her outfit! Not just a bit, but palpably and visibly wet! I would pay the extra money and buy the Swaddlers, which is what I have done."
102593,1,"I did a very thorough search of crib mobiles and their capabilities before I bought this one. I am very pleased with the results of this one. The mobile itself has 3 volume settings options (no sound, quiet, or louder), several music options in addition to a ""rainforest"" sound of birds chirping, owls hooting, and crickets making noise (my favorite setting, as it seems to sooth my 3 month old to sleep quickly), an option to have the night light on or off, and various combination options (i.e., light or no light with sound or no sound). The rainforest characters are very colorful and, in addition to the leaves going up and down, the orbital movements of the characters makes my daughter very fascinated. This mobile really started getting the quiet, peaceful attention of my daughter when she was 8 weeks old. Now at 13 weeks old, the mobile still gets used daily as she transitions off to sleep."
82799,1,"This Sleep Sheep has been great for my newborn niece. Although others may complain that it only has two time options, I've found that the options are efficient and allow for enough time for the child to fall asleep. Otherwise, it is simple to restart. Also, I love that there are 4 different sound options. Most toys only offer one sound option, and this can be annoying for the adults. I am very satisfied with this toy and would highly recommend it to others!(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
75322,2,"I bought this breast pump based on the reviews I read elsewhere thinking I made a good choice with all the other ones out there. The reviews were 50/50, but I decided to give it a try. Basically after the first month of pumping it started to squeak very loudly and I had to put a pillow over it to keep the noise to a minimal. Also when changing the setting from the mid point to the max point the pump did not pump any faster then the mid point which was very disappointing. I never did get a lot of yield from this pump. Trust me, you are better off with a different pump!!"
119747,1,"We used this for my son for the first 7-8 months. He loved being in it, and the added extra cup for pouring water on him was nice. The lid to the cup did not stay on though, so we just removed it and used it as a stand alone without the cap.I also received it and there were some blemishes in the blue foam where it looked like a staple had gone through them and ripped it a bit. If I'd bought it from a brick and mortar store, I'd have returned and exchanged it but I kept it as is. We plan on using it for our next child as well!"
148547,1,"I had originally purchased a smaller pillow for more money, and then I found this bad boy on Amazon. I returned the other pillow and told them they should seriously consider putting this pillow on the shelves. It is amazing... no joke. It is pretty big though, but I have a king size bed so it worked out great. The only regret I have about this pillow is that I didn't have it for my first pregnancy, because I remember how uncomfortable it was to sleep. This pillow made lying down so much more comfortable, and it is a big bargain compared to other pillows like it."
121640,1,"hard to find a smaller stroller with a handle bar in front. Son likes to hold on and sit up and most umbrella strollers don't offer that. We tried the others with a bar--Chicco and one other--but they felt flimsy and didn't steer well. This steers well, has a nice basket, ergo handles, reclines back. It could be lighter and I'd like a backpack strap, but best out there right now."
264,2,"I'm a little peeved I been using Pampers Nany-Dry for 2 Years, unannounced the company that makes Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers has made a major design change to Pampers Baby-Dry Diapers (they seem more like Huggies) - much more elastic, narrower straps and much less absorbent material. It's hard to make it thru the night without a diaper change now!"
145047,0,"I love the design of this stroller... but comfortable for the baby, and very easy to stroll. However, it's soooooooooo heavy, and I can't carry it by myself. It doesn't have a cup holder, the canopy is too mall, and the basket is very small. I want to love this stroller, but it's really way too heavy for me. I wish I did more research, and I would buy quinny senzz instead to adopt my maxi cosi car seat when my daughter was under 3 months."
61338,1,"Once it is set up properly, and I have to admit , it took a while to figure it out right, it works great. I have no problem keeping this in my bedroom because there is no bad smell and it is extremely convenient. In fact the liner smells like it is scented so when you open the top to put a diaper in, it actually smells pleasant. The only difficulty is when it fills up and you have to empty it before the refill empties. We just end up cutting off the used diapers and tying a new knot. My husband loves it too."
116047,1,This is great. A little flimsy with the velcro attaching hood thing but otherwise really good. We put it inside the co-sleeper and this seems to be a great infant sleeping arrangement.
124987,1,"This is an awesome gizmo for your kid to play in. I just wish mine would jump in it, but all he wants to do is swing. Great quality - fun toy."
126851,1,"I always read bad reviews to see if there is something informational there, but bad reviews for Huggies are just as strange as it could get. Diaper are designed to simplify parents life in comparison to regular cloth ones - from 20-30 years ago. But reading bad reviews I could not stop wondering why people are expecting these diapers to absorb unlimited quantity of pee? When you see &#34;crumbs&#34; this is actually a sign that you NEEDED to change this diaper ages ago. These are good diapers, but they need to be changed frequently like all other diapers. The older your kid the more often you need to change him - (s)he pees you know like a big boy or a big girl. These diapers are pretty absorbent, but it does not mean that you need to let your kid explore its capacity every time. In order to allow your kid to go through potty training successfully you still need to change him fairly often to give him a &#34;clean&#34; feeling. On another note accidents still might happen, this is why they are called accidents, and they will happen in any diapers, because kids are moving objects - mine 2-year old does not stop period even for food. Even my boy being so active I can assure that we did not have an accident for very long. Couple leak accidents we had in the beginning when diaper was not put properly or he needed to move up a size. I have a boy, so I can say these diapers are perfect for very active boys. Instructions are very simple - put diaper on, check how you did it, giggle with your kid when pushing his legs towards his tummy to allow better fit - done.If you like my review please mark it as helpful. Thanks :-)"
141226,1,"This is a great toy! I love that it has the removeable portion that has the toys on it-that is great if I need to set her in her crib for a few mins to do something quick-keeps her busy. She loves the phone and the barn door that opens, along with the shapes that she can take off and I love that they are attached so that I don't have to hunt them down when we put it up! And she pushes this around the house forever, it really encourages her to walk---if she could just learn how to turn it now, we'd be set!!"
163186,1,"Cradle sets are difficult to find and when I found this one I was very happy. When I received it I was even more pleased. The ""minky"" material for the bumpers and coverlet is sooo soft and cozy. The cradle sheet is knit and very easy to put on the mattress. And the price here at Amazon is very competitive with other stores. The only problem I have is now that I no longer have a use for this set, I'm finding it difficult to give away!"
117491,1,"My son absolutely loves this. We had a different one that we got from a consignment sale, but this one works much better. This one is much easier to get him into and it fits him much better. This is a must have for a baby with energy!!"
118451,0,Ordered this for my now 3 mnths old. The seat is pretty big so unless you have a large sink or another tub it has to go on the bath tub. Makes it hard with newborn.
36740,0,"I bought this as I was told it was must for breastfeeding moms. I actually hated using it while breastfeeding. I found it super uncomfortable and unnatural. The concept is on the mark, but each individual would need a boppy tailored for their body build (width, length, etc) and their baby's needs. As far as I'm concerned, it's a waste for breastfeeding.I'd give it a lower review, if it weren't for the comfort it afforded me while I was recovering from a rather large tear during labor. As I left the hospital the nurse told me to sit on a lot of pillows for the next couple of weeks. She told me a donut cushion would work best (so I put this to use). I'm shocked that I needed a comfy couch (really my couch is very soft), a folded blanket, a pillow, and this boppy (in that order) all under my derriere for about two weeks before I could sit without horrid pain.Yup, that was this things best use."
144403,1,"I like to use these for my mini poodle. You get more for your money versus regular doggie bags and they smell nice, which is always a plus."
180754,1,This is a highly portable mat for the pre-crawling baby. I highly recommend this mat because of the number of toys and the high quality of the mat. It offers plenty of cushion for the baby. Like all of these mats it folds up and can be carried easily. My daughter loved the large giraffe toy. I found it easy to clean and quite useful as a place to put her and engage her while I was visiting out of the house.
165394,1,"great quality, great price, never leaks, no blowouts = win!We only purchase pampers diapers now. The cute pattern of sesame street is nice to have, the tabs are soft and easily visable (pale green) rather than having to look for them, they're obvious. These smell good and stack well. We are big fans"
156200,1,My husband and i saw this piece and i said this is the one. The price was awesome! It arrived in about 5 days. WOW! I like that it has matching pieces to purchase also. We not only purchased this swing but we also purchased the car seat and the high chair. Other members of the family purchased the stroller and pack n play. I would highly recommend this piece.
157005,0,"I registered for this product because it was voted &quot;best&quot; in many toy reviews. It does have many interesting features but my son is overstimulated by many of the toys. I have even removed several of them to decrease the stimulation but he still gets irritated after a short time. The springs even have multi-colored covers that add stimulation but actually DO nothing. Looking back, I would have bought a much cheaper saucer and simply placed different toys on the table to vary the 'scenery'. Waste of money."
36276,1,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR A BABY SHOWER. BUT I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT AND IT LOOKED WONDERFUL
30932,1,"I do love the sit n stroll. We used this when our son was 6 months old and at 16 months and it was a dream. You just have to be use to taking the child out of the seat before you collapse it into a car seat. We only used this for the airport and car rentals. We already had a stroller at our destination which makes things a lot easier. So using the Sit n Stroll for the Airport, Flight car seat and Rental Car Seat is the optimal way for us in having this a success. We have used other solutions such as the CARE seat belt which is also awesome, but our son is still to small not to use the 5 point harness.We hope this helps other parents."
42395,1,I can't express how much I love my MOBY. I'm not sure how I lived without it with my other 2 kids. It is amazing!!!
82484,0,"This is a nice play yard and we have gotten a lot of use out of it but I'll be honest- the grandparents purchased similar ones by Graco and I wish we had one of those. I just found that they are a bit nicer and easier to use.PROS: the colors are more compatible with normal decor- giving your living-room a less ""BABY"" feel, Assembly was relatively easy- except the directions were pictures rather than words, the music and night-light are great and the remote is very convenient and worked well.CONS: the changing table is quite low- making it tough on the back, the vibrate option is totally undetectable! we would turn it on and press down on the bassinet portion of the yard and could not feel a thing! The mattress is not very comfy- our daughter will not sleep in it but she slept fine in the Graco one at Grandma's houseIn a nutshell, this is not a BAD play yard per se', I have just seen nicer ones and would have made a different decision had I known then what I now now."
63811,0,I was forced to buy this stroller after our Graco Metrolite broke catastrophically during some very cold eastern weather. (Graco has since sent us a brand new Metrolite) This Chicco has an even flimsier feel at the handle. All else feels well-made. I suggest to the manufacturers that their bottom line be to make a stroller that costs 150-250 dollars that will last two-three years. These 100-150.00 stroller feel terrible from the get go and only get worse. I would not buy this Chicco stroller again.
178284,2,"Do not buy the Lasinoh bags! They are not freezer safe! I dont know about you, but I work hard to pump and get the breastmilk my baby needs. When it comes time to defrost in the refrigerator, 1/2 of the milk leaks out! So upsetting. I do NOT recommend these bags under any circumstance."
20765,1,works really well and def gets the pump accessories clean. bought them for a friend and kept a few for myself ;-)
146231,1,"After an exhaustive search for a jumper or bouncer for our energetic infant, we came across the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo. The construction and design is solid and well done. The variety of activities for our boy is a nice balance for his development. He especially likes the tumbling gecko and the revolving sun, as well as the suspended parrot and frog. The rainforest theme is matched to his mobile and he has a variety of familiar characters to play with. The adjustable sound level on this Jumperoo is much appreciated. Adjusting the height of the Jumperoo is a little tricky, but the mechanism locks in place and is safe. The collapsable and snap-lock design of the support frame is great for transporting the Jumperoo from inside to outside and back again.We highly recommend this toy for parents of infants. Be aware the height and weight limits, and enjoy in the excitement that your baby will have when discovering jumping.This should be a default baby registry item - wish we bought it earlier. :)Happy parenting!"
57177,1,"This is a sturdy, durable, well-designed child gate that installs easily with qauality components. I would purchase this product again without hesitation."
149038,0,"This pillow is great with a few drawbacks...- The cover is difficult to remove for washing and even harder to put back on, so it's best to either make something or cut the end from an old pillowcase to cover the head area.- The filling deflates easily, so if this is something you are sleeping on every night, the head portion will need something beneath it within a month.- The cover isn't very soft, I would say about 150 TC or less.Other than these issues, the body pillow is very comfortable and doesn't ""run away"" overnight!"
149697,1,The construction and ease of putting together is wonderful! Would purchase from this company again. I would recommend this to everyone.
110289,1,I am really enjoying my glider. However I have hips so it seems snug. It is comfortable but a little more space wouldn't hurt. My mom has purchased the same chair in a different color.
142324,1,"This is great for baby to cuddle with. I am not sure why the description says ""rattle."" It does not have a rattle. It is just an animal blankie. My baby loves to chew on the paws. It has held up pretty well after washing multiple times."
180517,0,"I liked the idea of having a messenger-style diaper bag as opposed to the more prevalent tote-styles. The Diaper Dude bag is ok, but there are a few items that would make it better for my needs.My biggest wish is that the main compartment were larger. It's fairly small and when we put in all the things we'd like to carry, the bag gets stuffed and becomes somewhat misshapen to the point where it lays awkward on my hip and back. I tend to carry portable wipes, 4-5 diapers, 1-2 change of clothes, a hat, a blanket, a sippy cup, a snack trap, a couple of toys, my cell phone and keys. Because I can't find a place for everything, the main inside compartment is a mishmash of unorganized items.The cell phone holder does a fine job holding my LG flip phone. A bigger phone however wouldn't fit, but $15 for a Timbuk2 cell phone case would solve that. Also, the elasticized bottle pocket is pretty snug so getting a bottle in and out is kinda tough. On the other hand, the bottle doesn't fall out accidentally.Additionally, the dirty diaper pocket in the large compartment should probably have a zipper to keep the smell out of the other items in the bag and avoid cross contamination. The hooks for keys and pacifiers would probably only hold keys. The pacifiers being sold these days aren't on a ring and are much too big to be hooked onto the bag. The included changing pad is padded nicely though.Overall, it's a decent bag, especially at Amazon.com prices. Someone in our play group has complimented me twice on the bag so I may just give it away to them or keep it as a backup bag. I recently ordered a DadGear messenger diaper bag for nearly the same price and am hoping that it holds all my items better."
116413,1,I like this sling but it is very simple for a hefty price tag. You could honestly create your own to do the same thing since it is just fabric.
18641,1,"My kids and I absolutely love our cruiser. I have a 1 year old, and a 3 year old (25 and 35 pounds) and we take our cruiser everywhere. In spring, summer, fall we pull it on the bike and it is great exercise and we don't have to insure our vehicle. In the winter we can push it through the snow even before the sidewalks are plowed (and we can pull the cover over the top so the kids don't experience the wind chill that I do). No the front wheel does not turn, but I don't think this is a problem at all. Unless you have absolutely no arm muscle and cannot pick the front wheel up, but I have no problem with the 60 pounds I push around. I think this is the greatest invention and people stop us on the street to jokingly ask for a ride and to say how great it looks and how cute the kids are... I wouldn't trade mine in for anything, and I will be very disappointed when the kids are too big for it."
98069,1,"I have read all the reviews of this product and I can't believe some of the negative comments... especially the review referring to its usage in a bottle warmer. I love this bottle. And I DO use it in a bottle warmer. It works fantastic. AND I've never had a problem mixing the formula right in the bottles. As for the comments about this bottle dripping the hot water from the warmer - it's really very simple - just make sure that when you shake up the formula in the bottle that you shake all the water off the bottom of the bottle. NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL! And Ive NEVER had any milk leaking out of this bottle. You just have to assemble the bottle correctly. It's really very easy. I would highly recommend this bottle. My daughter went back and forth from breastfeeding to the VentAire bottle with ease, and she has minimal gas. It's always very simple to get a burp out of her afterwards. GREAT BOTTLE!!"
78228,1,Very good product for travel anywhere. Fits all chairs. Goes anywhere. A must have. It was the best 15.00 we spent. I see now it is 19.00 still worth the money. I will be doing a repeat buy for this with our second child.
149585,1,"This is a very cute toy box. A little smaller than I would have liked, but it fits all the daughters books in it nicely. It was a little difficult to put together, but once it was done it is very cute!!!"
111100,1,"I used this cover daily for the first year of my baby's life (and beyond) and will do the same for my second. It's lightweight but opaque. You can see the baby while he is nursing and nurse discreetly. People usually think it's a cover to keep lights out when the baby's sleeping, and sometimes make the mistake of peeking in your cover to ""see the cute baby sleeping in there"". This cover got tons of use. I wish I had two of them, for when I used the towel to wipe the baby's mess and it went into the laundry. It's the one thing I buy for my friends when they are having a new baby and the one thing I consider my most valuable baby item - second to diapers!"
100494,2,"My 5 month old never had diaper rash until she started using the Pampers baby dry (size 1) she doesn't even sleep for more than 4 hours at a time so she never sat in a diaper for much longer than that. I would never buy these again. In fact, we have tons leftover and I'd rather waste the money than subject my baby to them."
141432,2,"I am starting to think many of the amazon reviews are fake. This STUPID toy is not safe! It is too lightweight which causes it to tip over when baby pulls herself up (she is 9 months old). The wheels have no traction whatsoever, which makes the toy slide and baby fall on her face. Repetitive sounds will drive anyone crazy! Must of all, it is not safe! Bad bad design! NOT designed for baby learning to walk! I wish I could return it, but the packaging comes with so many tapes and wires that you have to tear the box in pieces to take the toy out and try it, probabily to make sure nobody returns it! One of the worst baby products I ever bought!"
159241,2,"I got this in my baby shower. I started using it when my baby was 4 months old and started to sit. It is very unsafe. The seat it not good enough at all and the baby is very likely to fall by the side. I will not recommend it t anyone. Moreover, the music, the fish moving nothing worked for me. Only the vibration works."
131799,1,"I researched a few different seats to put in our new Odyssey van in September (07). Our daughter just turned two and we wanted to get a new car seat for her so her Evenflo Triumph could go in my husbands car. She had been using the Triumph since she was about 9 months (rear-facing), and then forward facing from about 14 months. We really loved the Triumph, but I wanted something she could grow into. Meaning - getting the most out of a car seat height and weight wise for the longest period of time.Britax was one of the only ones I found, that actually makes a heavy-duty quality seat that I knew would last. Sure, I looked at a few others that ranked up there with height and weight (i.e. Eddie Bauer, Cosco, and Graco), but none of these compared in quality and durability! We made the trip to Babies r Us so we could ""test"" the few different seats I had chosen from Consumer Reports ratings. The Eddie Bauer deluxe booster was out because the first time I snapped the metal part into the crotch strap I pinched my daughters skin and she screamed like crazy! I felt so bad, and my husband immediately said, ""That's it for this one!"" and put it back on the shelf.The Eddie Bauer would have been the only other one we would have considered because it was more durable and sturdy than the Cosco and Graco. We did try the Britax Boulevard, but found it rather cumbersome to adjust the head rest and my daughter's head seemed to lean too far forward with the pillow being there. Overall, she looked uncomfortable in the Boulevard. We also tried the Britax Regent. Talk about a monstrosity of a car seat, but we both loved it, especially my hubby! It held my daughter in snug and secure and was easy to install into the test seat they have at the Babies r Us store. My taller than average daughter looked dinky in the Regent! The only reason we decided not to get the Regent was because our daughter still sleeps in her car seat on longer trips and the Regent just wasn't going to give her the head support and comfort level I wanted her to have while snoozing. By not buying the Regent as opposed to the Decathlon, we only gave up a 15 pound weight and 4"" height ability and we knew our daughter was going to outgrow the height limit WAY before she outgrew the weight limit. When that happens we'll probably just go to a standard backless booster that she'll use with the seatbelt from the car.Well, BrU didn't have the Decathlon at the store, and it wasn't one I was considering. I had researched the Marathon on Amazon and liked the reviews, but after comparing numerous reviews of the two seats. I decided on the Decathlon for three reasons: 1) It had the infant padding for rear-facing which will be good for our next child that comes along; 2) It had the toddler pillow; and 3) It had the adjustable crotch strap which I knew I would need for my daughter (she's in the 97th percentile for height, being 36"" tall at 24 months!). Essentially, the Decathlon and Marathon have the same seat structure and height and weight capacities, but the Decathlon has the ""extras"" I mentioned. Also, the Decathlon has a push-button strap release and tightener. The Marathon has a clasp crimper to hold the straps tight. Knowing the seat structures were basically the same, I toted my daughter over to Target and tried her in the Marathon, and I liked it, so I bought the Decathlon on Ebay.It is so easy to install once you've looked over the directions. Of course, at first it took some time, but now it's a breeze. The thing is rock solid in the captain's chair of our Odyssey. With the anchor belt and the tether anchor attached this baby isn't going anywhere unless the whole captain's chair comes off! Even without the tether anchor it still didn't move. The material is nice and heavy and the seat is adequately padded. It sits up high so my daughter can see everything outside. I love the ""hugs"" system the straps have because it makes my daughter fit snuggly into the seat.I only have two complaints about this seat, which really aren't that bad, just annoyances - 1) Sometimes the straps do twist a bit and I have to untwist them, especially with an independent toddler who wants to push their own arms through the straps and 2) It does take a little bit of strength to tighten down the straps with the push-button strap holder. I usually pull it as tight as I can and then if it still has too much slack I push the button with my left thumb and pull the strap with my right hand until it's tightened to my satisfaction.Overall, I've been very happy with the Britax Decathlon car seat. It was a good investment and as many of the reveiwers have stated - the price is worth every penny knowing that your child is protected very well. One bit of advise I'd give to anyone considering ANY car seat - GO TO A STORE WHERE YOU CAN TEST THE SEATS OUT ON YOUR CHILD! All children are different shapes and sizes and the seats are different. We are so glad we took our daughter to BrU and put her in each seat we were considering - and look, we didn't even buy any of the seats we were originally considering based on the Consumer Reports ratings I looked at! You just never know!Update - November 11, 2008Still loving this carseat. I had to take everything apart to clean it a couple weeks ago. It was a time consuming task, but not hard. The seat cover cleaned up beautifully and it looks brand new! Unfortunately, my daughter is now three and just about to outgrow the top slots (she's 41"" now!). She probably has another couple months in it. I'd really like to keep her in a harness for a lot longer, so I'm now checking out the new Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 carseat that's on the market. It's getting awesome reviews and it's a fraction of the cost of this seat or any of the other Britax's. Baby #2 will be here in December, so this one will be put away for when he/she is out of the infant carrier and this seat is big enough to keep the new little one rear-facing for a longer time!"
182853,1,"I am an extremely paranoid person, as most of us are when it comes to our kids. I did a TON of research on the safety of car seats and am glad to say this was really smart purchase! My daughter and son were in the graco snug ride till they were about 4 months old ( thankfully that was one of the infant carrier car seats that passed the safety standards, just recently released!). We moved her into this seat for several reasons.1. You couldn't beat the safety rating (check out consumer reports) and the value. This was definitely well worth the purchase. We have 2 of them as I made sure to place both of my kids in the same seat and they are 2 years apart in age!2. I am a big person, so when I think about having to sit in a car for a long period of time, cushioning was very important to me, because I wanted the kids to be comfortable. We will be driving back and forth to California from Florida every year starting this year. I really do not want the children to be in a seat that offers them nothing. My daughter thinks she is the queen of the world when she is riding around in this seat. My son had issues riding in the car until we switched over to this seat! He loves it.3. This seat is easy as can be to use. My advice, read the instructions! They are behind the cloth in the car seat. To wash this and protect it, I usually take the cover and padding sections off and place them in king size pillow case, tie it off and throw them in the washing machine, then I hang it all to dry. Thankfully this dries pretty quickly.4. The only problem I came across was the straps getting stuck sometimes when you are trying to loosen them. With some work between my sister in law ( which by the way has the same car seat and loves it) and my self, we realized that there was dirt and crumbs getting stuck in the gear that loosens the car seat straps. If you look at the seat area of the car seat where the buckle is, you will see a flat metal plate that the buckle attaches to. That is where stuff gets down into, so to clear this up, when we clean the car, we started using the vacuum to clean that section of the car seat really well. Since we started to do that we have had NO problems.5. The reclining levels are AWESOME! My kids are always comfortable even when it is the long drives. The latch system is easy to use and a definite must have! I really could not have found a better car seat.I thought that I would have to buy the 2-3 hundred dollar car seats to find one that I would be comfortable with. Thankfully I didn't waste my money and I spent the time to do the research. Trust me when I say, YOU WILL LOVE THIS SEAT AND FEEL SAFE USING IT!"
108302,1,"These nipples are the reason I'm able to breastfeed my daughter. She would not latch on well, and when she did latch on she wouldn't suck good enough to get anything out so she would get frustrated and quit. I had to bottle feed her for several weeks after birth. From experience with my first child I knew that once babies are given a bottle, it is more difficult to get them back on the breast. Not only do they get nipple confusion, but other bottles flow faster so they are more instantly satisfied. I have tried other so called ""non-drip"" nipples and they do not work. I saw these in the store and decided to give them a try. Let me tell you at first my daughter did NOT like them, because they actually DO NOT DRIP just like they claim. So she had a hard time learning how to suck, however, that is exactly what I needed her to learn how to do. So I stuck with this nipple insisting that she learn eventually, and she did. Once she had a good grasp of the sucking, I was able to transition her back to the breast with no nipple confusion at all. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a true non-drip nipple. I hate how the other nipples continue to drip in the baby's mouth even when they stop sucking, because that is not realistic to what the breast does. I think it makes them ""lazy"" and I don't like how my baby would gasp with the other bottles because the flow was way too fast (yes even the slow flow nipples). With these when she takes a break from sucking the flow stops just like at the breast. LOVE IT!"
50728,0,"this pillow sounds like a good idea, but it is a little soft. i think it would've benefitted from being plumper. the covering is very rough, even after several washes, it feels rough and itchy, like cheap linen. for the price of the pillow, a higher thread count for the covering would've gone a long way!"
109529,0,"The concept of these feeders is just genius, and I was very pleased the first few times I gave my son some fruit in them. He caught right on and seemed to love sucking and chewing on it, too.But when I came on to write a good review for them, and saw all the comments about plastic chemicals and fibers coming loose, I was very disappointed.Sadly, they went into the trash that day. I really don't want to take any risks with my baby. Maybe Ill try another brand."
143055,2,"The first impression of the bag is nice, seems to be good materials and a nice design with great features. Then you start using it and realize that all the stitching holding the straps/handle on come apart and unravel very easily. They need to take another look at finding a better method for attaching the straps to this bag because the current construction method is very bad. I did not have the bag long enough to test the durability of the rest of it, as soon as the straps started coming off I returned it to Amazon. I only had the bag for a total of 4 days. I am still waiting for my money to be refunded but so far Amazon as a whole has been great, unfortunately with this bag you just don't get what you paid for. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1 is for design, and because I can't say the rest of the bag is faulty since I did not keep it long enough to test that.I hope this helps in the decision making."
62357,1,I absolutely love this item. I have a 5 point harness carset and it works wonderful with it. My son stays cozy and warm. It transfers really well into a stroller too. It is a wonderful product. Very glad I bought it!!!
145818,1,"We bought this jumperoo when my son was 5 months old because we wanted options other than tummy time (which he didn't really love) to keep him entertained and off his back. We thought the jumperoo was a bit pricey, but it has been worth every penny.First of all, he loves it. He immediately took to investigating all the toys, though it was a few days before he got to really CRAZY bouncing, and a few months before he could easily pull himself around (the seat rotates 360 degrees). And since he can't get out of the jumperoo, it's a safe place to leave him while we run around doing housecleaning. Another plus is that it really helped strengthen his legs and core, enabling him to sit better and ""stand"" with support.Our son's now 9 months old, and he still loves his jumperoo and bounces away every day. There are three levels, so the toy can grow with baby (if your baby's stopped jumping, he's probably grown too tall and you need to raise it). Sadly, our son's on the last level, so his joyful jumping will soon be coming to an end. I hope to pass this on so another baby can enjoy months of fun."

21100,1,"I'm not sure how the diapers were fastened by those who only gave these diapers 1 star, but I find that Huggies Supreme are the best diapers and I've tried them all. These diapers catch everything! From side-to-side, from front to back, all the messy stuff stays inside."
9717,1,"Great starter potty for toilet training. Just the right size, plain and not intimidating. No destractions. Great rubber bottom so it does not slide on bathroom floor. Very easy to clean! I loved this one so much, I bought 2 more."
36250,0,The ends do not stay on the tube very well. Cute if you are going to put away in storage - not for display
133051,1,No foul odors. Easy to use. Refill bags last about 3 months.Would definetly recommend for anyone who is expecting.=)
40412,1,"I have five kids, and have been changing diapers for 11 years, five months, and 1 day. Not that I'm counting. I've found that these diapers (and their previous incarnation: Pampers Premium) are the best. So absorbant... snug where needed, allowing room where needed. The gel stuff doesn't break apart, and I seriously think that they could hold 2 quarts of liquid. Not that I'd ever leave my 22 month old unchanged long enough to find that out...er... but still. The only thing that I'm not crazy about is the BLUE trim. My last 3 have been girl babies, and sometimes the blue just clashes with their girly outfits. So, not a big deal, but just plain white would work for me. But, heck, I don't care that much because I completely anticicpate being done with the whole diaper thing in another 6-9 months or so. Give or take a few days."
10267,1,This was a good buy for my 27 mo old stepdaughter who is potty training! The seat fit well on my standard toilet and did not move or cause messes. She sits comfortably and is able to toilet herself happily and independently! I put a 3M Command hook next to the toilet and the seat stays there when she's not using it. When she is ready she easily takes it off and puts it on the toilet herself! A must buy for all parents potty training and a great alternative to using a floor potty.
152961,1,"This cabinet lock is great for use with cabinet doors. It is easy to use and effective. I prefer this one with the open top over the completly encircled type, we have both types."
111643,1,"This pump is great! I purchased it because of the pain I was having from my baby not latching on properly. I was going to purchase an electric double pump, but I might just stick with this. I can pump anywhere and it is quiet, my hands and arms do not get tired either. It is very easy to use and clean. My baby is getting more milk in one feeding, which is awesome! Less crying from baby and less fustration from me. I also use this pump with the mOmma 5oz bottle, hpa lanolin, and storage bottles... the system is wonderful!"
119385,1,"I purchased this item based on other reviews. I also received a boppy but decided to use the brest friend pillow for breastfeeding.This pillow makes breastfeeding easier. My newborn can lay on the pillow for support and I can use my arm to wrap her without having to actually hold her in my arm. My hand is free to support and adjust her head. She also seems very comfortable on the pillow.I did have to wait a few days after coming home from the hospital before using the pillow because it didn't fit around my waist. But after those few days, I had no problems putting it on and using it.I would definitely recommend this pillow to others who are breastfeeding."
71721,0,"This looked like the perfect thing to help my boy learn how to walk. I was really excited to start using it, and it does work for the most part. The problem is that it rides up under his armpits, no matter how snug we fasten it. It sometimes rides up under his chin as well. This would work better if it had a stap around the legs as well. It does take some time to get the hang of it. I have found, for me, it is easier to just use the arm straps instead of the extention straps. This may be because I am short (although the straps do adjust quite well). On the bright side, my son does like it when I put him in this contraption and let him walk around. He doesn't mind it riding up under his arm pits as much as I do, I suppose."
181007,2,"I bought this mat for my first baby and I feel like it was a waste of money. There are other mats out there that have toys and are better quality. Everytime I pick this up to move it, it falls apart and I went to insert the batteries and the screws were stripped. So much for the music and sound. One the good note she likes the mirror and hanging toys, but all mats have this feature and are much cheaper. This is my 2nd and last fisher Price item, the swing I bought works poorly and not worth the $150 we paid."
3545,2,I purchased this item a few months ago and just took it out of the box for my daughter born the end of November...well all the padding has completely broken down and flaked all over!!!! I now have a complaint against combi pending and now must purchase a new seat because i will not put her in this one!!!!!!!!!do not purchase!!!!! who only knows what the material is made of( it was made in Italy)less then 1 star
18748,1,"Singularly my favorite baby product! My daughter slept through the night at 8 weeks due to this nifty swaddle blanket. Unlike the other swaddle blankets, the Miracle Blanket keep the baby's arms from escaping trough the night. This allows the baby to sleep more soundly with shocking themselves awake or scrtaching their face. Buy it and try it! You will be a big fan too!"
132949,1,"I started using this diaper pail when my son was weaned from breastfeeding and started having stinky diapers. He is now 2, and I am still using it and it has no problem with his larger, smellier, messier diapers - if you know what I'm saying...It is hands free - just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in. No need for pushing, twisting, or 2-handed systems to get the diaper in there...Which is a tremendous help with a wiggly baby or toddler on the changing table! Changing the bag is simple...Just cut the old one, tie off the bags, pull through new liner...simple once you try it a couple of times. I am very glad I made this purchase instead of trying something like the diaper &quot;genie.&quot; I will say just one note: If you place this pail near a window where light shines in on it...It WILL stink! Use common sense in where you locate your pail and you shouldn't have ANY (or very little) odor with the diaper dekor. Also, if your toddler has 4-5 BIG poopy diapers in one day...Change the bag! Again, common sense can tell you this is more than the average stink for one day, so don't expect the dekor to NEVER smell. Overall, I give it 5 stars!!! Buy it - It works."
19858,2,These bowls are an absolute waste of money. I bought these from Target (wish I had read reviews at Amazon). I have hardly used them and now I am throwing them away. The suction does not work..my 8mth old can pull it out with one hand. The lids take a hug amt of strength to close the bowls.
121610,1,This stroller has a great design. It is very confortable for kids and fits in a small trunk.
149104,1,"I'm now 35 weeks pregnant, but my husband bought me this pillow when I was around 18 weeks. I don't know how I would have made it through this pregnancy without this pillow. You have to trial different ways of using it to see what will work best for you. I put a pillow on top of the head pillow and then scoot up so that my shoulder is just barely resting in the cutout. This way you don't deal with shoulder pain from the cover.I sleep through the night and don't wake up to rearrange pillows every time I turn over. It also supports you well under your big belly and from the back. My husband is 6'2"" and we have a queen bed, and it hasn't been a problem at all. He still has plenty of space, or else snuggles up next to me and the pillow.I highly recommend this pillow to get the most needed and elusive thing during pregnancy...sleep!!"
88653,2,"These diapers are TERRIBLE. I bought them, hoping that they would keep my daughter nice and dry all night long when she sleeps for 12 hours. When she woke up in the morning, her sleeper was wet and her skin was very wet as well, inside the diaper. The diaper did not keep her dry like it claimed it would. Her Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers kept her way drier then this diaper! When she wears those all night, they soak up everything and her skin is still pretty dry the next morning. I will never use Baby Dry again."
105727,1,"Poop smells bad. It's why we don't call it ""potpourri"" instead of ""poop"". Contained poop stored for a week smells REALLY bad. So, empty the champ every other day, let it air out while you carry the bag to the garage, and then put in another scented garbage bag and just be happy you didn't have to make an emergency run to the store for silly diaper genie bags.If a whiff of dirty diapers as you empty the pail has you fainting, then by all means, you should be warned...worse stuff than this is gonna happen before your kid reaches 18.I love my champ, and since even I was too squeamish for cloth diapers, at least I feel better knowing I'm not having to gift wrap every single dirty diaper.The champ may not smell like roses all the time, but frankly, neither does your baby.Maintaining the champ is not as easy as flushing a toilet, but really, what in life is? It's not like this is brain surgery.And lastly, if you are breaking nails opening this thing, then maybe you should cut your coffee intake in half."
17055,1,"Love it! Love it! Love it! It is the BEST GIFT I recieved. We have been using it ever since my son started sleeping in his own room, at night I switch it to audio only and if I hear him cry I turn on the visual to see what is going on. We recently took a trip and forgot to take the system with us, and both my husband and I spent the evenings running up stairs to the bedroom to check on the baby every hour. With the system, we can take the monitor anywhere in the house and we know that we can still have an eye on him. It's kinda like ""Big Brother"" LOVE it! I'm getting this for my best friend's baby shower so she can enjoy it as much as we do......THANK YOU FOR inventing this!!!!!!!"
33979,1,"It's awesome, sturdy and comfortable. Read through all the reviews and I don't understand the bad ones."
69792,1,This item loses a star for not having much padding in the seat and for taking up a lot of space. Otherwise I couldn't be happier with it. It does wonderfully for my son.
93581,2,I really disliked this product. It leaked out between the potty and the bowl. It is also very difficult to clean. I noticed an odor from it one day so I started looking and found a lot of crevices that are impossible to get clean. I called Fisher-Price and they were very nice and sent me coupons for the amount I paid for it. I replaced it with an inexpensive potty without the musical feature.
156260,2,This item came through on some of the paperwork as a bike but is actually a Schwinn double jogging stroller. We ordered it twice but the packaging was so poor both the strollers were broken upon arrival. There was no packing material and the box construction was poor (not enough glue to hold it together.) The hinges where the canopy attaches to the stroller rubbed right through the box and and in each case one side was broken. Too bad. It otherwise seemed like a nice item at a good price.
11418,1,"I'm active. In and out of the house, up and down stairs. This thing keeps falling off my waste. The belt clip is worthless. Other then this it's awesome and we do keep it plugged in at all times."
72068,1,"Perfect size and color for crib. Ordered now in case discontinued, but will be perfect once baby gets bigger and need toddler bed."
149442,2,"The 1st impression I had when I received this pillow is that I got scammed. It is only a piece of foam cut into weird shape, worth about [...]. My son hates it. We brought it with us in a long trip, and it was only for my husband to put on his back seat. I would not recommend this to anyone."
35346,1,Excellent. Keeps the sun off very well. Easy to install/remove. Folds up. Nice quality. What can I say? If you live in a sunny place go get one.
134320,2,"We used this for a little while, now its a glorified wipe dispenser. It dried out the wipes and we ended up throwing a bunch out. Our son didn't show any sort of preference of warm vs cold wipes. Sure with a baby boy the cold wipes give a greater chance of ""spraying"", but it still happened with the warm wipes. Not to mention now that he is 14 months old he stands up on the changing table and opens the top and pulls all the wipes out of it. I am now just going to start using the plastic container, at least that is harder to get open."
32260,1,I buy this as a shower gift for all new moms. They all rave about how much easier feeding and tending to baby is with this product.
48229,0,"It fits very good, but I wish it had been made in a softer material. It is big to storage under the stroller."
61032,2,I started out with the Diaper Champ - to a fault of my own I needed a new diaper pail so i decided to try the Diaper Genie. I had the old style Diaper Genie at my mothers and I liked it so I thought I would try the new and improved one. I hate it Im returning it today - u have to shove a full diaper in it until the clips catch it and then twist it - if u go to far - oh well and if u dont go far enough - shove that full dirty diaper down some more. I also think it is to short. The one star I will give it is that it did keep the odor out. The other star is for emptying it. Very easy. Overall - I'll never buy one for anyone I know. When it goes back a new Diaper Champ will replace it.
38575,1,"My nearly 4 month old takes long warm baths in our large kitchen sink. We pad the sink with the safer bather and all is well! In fact, it's fun! He loves splashing the water with his little hands and kicking his feet up with his bum secure on the cushion!!! He gets to recline into the water and is almost totally submerged.I love quick it dries. I just hang it on the shower head in the bathroom and it's dry in a few hours - to speed that up, you can just ring it out and it dries MUCH faster! My baby will have to graduate to the tub soon but when he does, the safer bather is moving on with us!"
100073,1,I send these diapers to my daughter every month. She tells me that they are the best for keeping my grandson dry. She wouldn't purchase any other brand.
8690,2,"I bought these and am returning them. I'm sure that they would be fine if you had 2 of the same strollers and didn't have to separate them once set up. One of my strollers has oval tubing bars and the other one has round, and I couldn't get the connectors to close. As well, they are a little tricky to separate (I tried doing this before trying to attach to the stroller) - I wouldn't want to be somewhere needing to separate them quickly, especially with 2 kids to watch!I also bought the Munchkin Stroller links which seem to work great (attaches 2 different strollers) and much easier to un-attach! I will review this one after our trip."
106622,0,"I don't think there is any magic solution for diapers except to take them outside. The diaper champ is very easy to use but after a few bad diapers, it has become the Diaper Challenger.We now use sented bags and that helps a bit. Bottom line: Empty it often!"
165452,1,"Received from amazon within few days of ordering the product, though it was standard free super saving shipping. I'm using pampers baby dry for my elder one till he was completly potty trained. And now I have started buying baby dry for my little one who is 1 month old. Its so comfortable and keep's my babies bottom dry."
46106,0,"I'm not sure how this toy would be for my son since I can't get it to attach to my crib. When I hold it up above his head myself, he loves it, but since I have a crib where the edges curve out at the top, the design of the mobile doesn't seem to work. If you have a standard crib where the sides are completely vertical, then it should be fine. Otherwise, it doesn't seem to want to attach."
21928,2,"I bought this and my husband put it together, after putting it together, the second drawer wouldn't close all the way. It was almost like it was made and built without measuring it correctly. It would stop and leave the drawer open about an inch. I had even called someone to come to fix it and see if there was something that we could do to fix that and there wasn't anything he could do, he said it was the way it was made. He put cardboard on the side of the rails that the drawer slides on to give us a quick fix but that only helped for a few days. I'm very disappointed that I spend almost 300 dollars on a dresser when I could have bought a cheap one from Walmart that would have worked better than this one. Buy at your own risk!"
183053,1,"This is an excellent light-weight stroller. It doesn't have much storage on the sides, but you can hang your diaper bag easily over the handles. I have a very large 8 month old and have used this stroller exclusively for the last 4 months. It folds very compactly and is very light - I carry my son in one arm and this in the other hand. The only feature that I feel could be better is the sun shade, it is a little small and awkard but that is my only complaint.My husband and I are both tall and have no problems with the size of this stroller."
48750,1,The Superyard XT is just what we needed. We already had gates on the stairs but our little one who recently found his new freedom that crawling allowed didn't want to stay in the living room and play with his toys any longer. All he wanted to do is explore. We actually have the Superyard stretched out and runs from the fireplace across the hallway to the stairs blocking off his access to a bathroom and kitchen. It stays stable with some small kinks at the joints so it's not in a straight line that he can't knock it down. It's high enough that he can't get over but low enough for a teenager and above to step over.
108231,1,"First let me say that I am a member and moderator at a forum dedicated specifically to Pumping Breastmilk and I have experience with a Hospital Grade Pump (Medela Lactina) as well as the Medela Hand Pump. I pumped EXCLUSIVELY for 2 full months while working with my daughter to get her to latch on. And I must say, even after using such a superior breast Pump (the Lactina) I think the Isis is absolutely fabulous!I used this pump once or twice per day in order to pump about 8 or so ounces so that my daughter could have milk while I was away for 3 hours per day finishing up my degree. I found the pump highly effective and delicate on my girls. ;) I love the convenience of having it pumped straight into the bottle. All you need to do is attach a nipple or soft spout, the ring, and voila! Baby can be fed. I was able to pump four ounces in about 5 minutes flat with this pump.Some people notice that they cannot get suction when they use the soft petal insert. I was one of those people. After removing that soft plastic piece I found the suction to be 10 times better so for those who are having trouble with this product please consider that.I wouldn't recommend this to women who are going back to work full time though. I think it might best benefit those people to invest in the Pump In Style."
32281,1,"If you are gonna breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow!!! they are awesome and easy. you can wash them, they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere.Love it!!! ++++"
73694,1,"This timer arrived when my baby was almost 4 weeks and I SO wish I'd had it going into delivery. I now live by it. It is a simple thing, 4 count-up timers, a nightlight, and a left/right switch for breast feeding reminders. The timers' big buttons reset to 0 when pressed. As long as you remember to push the buttons when baby events happen, it is awesome. I use it to time feeding, being sleep or awake, and the last time the diaper has been changed. The extra timer has been used for prescription or pumping reminders. It is so great that this keeps track of these things relieving my sleep addled brain from having to do it. Each timer can be set to chime when a set amount of time (in half hour increments) has elapsed.At first, I thought the nightlight was kind of a waste. However, it comes in handy when I want to get around without waking up the baby, my husband, or both. It is just bright enough to keep me from knocking into anything or breaking a toe.Another reviewer criticized that the information is not saved and you can't download the information to a computer. It is true that you will have to write the information down in order to track and see trends for feeding and sleeping. I don't mind that the Itzbeen doesn't have that is it would become a much more expensive and complicated device. At this stage in parenthood, I appreciate simplicity.The breast feeding switch on mine stays where I put it so it is effective for keeping track of which side I started with last.The display on this has almost no viewing angle. In order to see the numbers, you have to look directly at it. I've gotten used to it but it is the one are of improvement that I would really like to see."
18547,1,"Anyone who cares about their babies comfort needs to buy these bottles!! I just bought them today after five months of using the avent bottles. These actually stand up true to their purpose...less gas, less spitting up, less colic!!!! My son has never enjoyed his bottle more than what he did when I fed him using this bottle earlier. He had the tinest burp and he hasn't even spit up all day!! My son used to be ""THE KING OF SPIT""!! I am so happy we found the perfect resolution to that problem. A few extra pennies for an immediate fix is worth it and the cleaning isn't a biggie, especially if your baby's health and happiness matters to you!! BUY THESE BOTTLES!!!"
105538,0,"I don't think this pail really did everything I was expecting, which was based on the content they provided on their site. I had a hard time opening and closing it, and honestly the smells containment was not any greater than a normal trash bin. Cute design, but not worthy of higher expectations."
27893,1,I am very pleased with the purchase of the Silver Plated Train banks that I purchased. The train bank is of excellent quality and the service was much quicker than I expected. Overall it was a terrific experience and would not hesitate purchasing from them in the future.
144917,1,This product is perfect. It won't fall on the floor. I wish they made these in the vanilla scented Soothie.
156862,0,I bought this toy for my 5 month old daughter and she loves it! The only thing that I didn't like was the bright orange toy that has a face with beads inside that they can hit and shake. My daughter put this in her mouth and the thin wavy plastic on top of the toy got wedged in her mouth and she could not get it out and it made her choke. All of the other toys on the saucer are fine. I would recommend this saucer to other people because it is nice to have something that you can fold down and take with you but you need to be careful with that paticular toy on this saucer.
179662,1,"I recently flew with my 11 month old son using the Travel Mate. It worked like a charm. I was able to assemble it easily, it rolled well, and fit into all the xray machines without being taken apart. My son was comfortable and enjoyed seeing the world. Using this and checking the seat at the gate meant that I could make it through the airport process comfortably also, and I didn't have to worry about getting a safe carseat at my destination. One note: the telescoping handle seems to prefer being at its highest level, which was awkward for my short grandmother. Otherwise, I totally recommend it."
134538,0,"This product does keep the sun out; however, the rod that holds it up broke after one use. Luckily my husband was able to buy materials and make a new one, but it was a big inconvenience."
106804,2,"I've never felt compelled to write a review before, but those who say they have no smell w/their Diaper Champ must have kids that don't have stinky poop. My husband changes the bag out every day and it's still terrible. We have a 3-1/2 year old (nearly potty trained) and an 18 month old, and even just urine diapers smell up the room in this thing. The mechanism is easy to use, which is why I gave it 2 stars. That's my only compliment.We've had a Diaper Genie for over 3 years and wanted to replace it b/c some of the parts had broken (hinge on the lid). So I bought this based on Amazon recommendations. I'm now planning on giving it to a friend (who likes her Diaper Champ) and buying another Diaper Genie. Not much of a smell w/those. And yes, you do have to buy the refills w/a Diaper Genie, but they last a long time (2-3 months on average) and if I'm having to throw away a regular trash bag every day to manage the smell of my Diaper Champ, I think the cost just about evens out.One more thing about my Diaper Genie. We have two diaper pails - one for upstairs and one down. I've already bought one new Diaper Genie and my big complaints of the 3 year old model I'm replacing have been fixed. There's no more ring anymore (those of you who have older Genies will know what I'm talking about). The refill bags just set down in there now - so much easier! It's so much nicer and contains smells great. So I'm going for my second new Diaper Genie to replace my Diaper Champ."
175410,1,"This is perfect for my 3 month old! It's a safe place that he can lay on his back and play with toys. It's also a great way to do ""tummy time"" for those babies that hate laying flat on their stomach! The bright colors are wonderful for babies! My son LOVES it and so do I!"
130637,0,"I will not argue, this is a good swing. however, my daughter was 4 months before she began to enjoy the fish and lights, etc. it was very useful for naps and putting her down for a minute. i got it as a gift so it wasnt a problem, but a plain swing with a mobil would do just as well. also, the tray is a pain to use, we took it off and just buckled her in.as far as safety is concernd - pretty stable on lower speeds, less stable on higher ones. it rocked back and forth, alternatley lifting one leg or the other, off the floor. not enough to cause concern, but enough to notice.We bought rechargeable batteries - the music and lights are what zapp the batteries of their juice, so we often just put the swing on and play a lullby CD..works just as well, and saves the battery juice.I wouldnt pay this much money on my own, but if someone wants to buy it, great."
132781,1,"I bought this diaper pail after reading many reviews for several different brands. We've had it for 10 months now, and it has really met our diaper disposal needs. I have never had a problem with any odor escaping, and the capacity is good. We are in the habit of rolling soiled diapers tightly before tossing them in the pail, and this helps to maximize space. Also, I would recommend folding in any ""leaks"" when you roll the diaper because it could leave ""skid marks"" on the inner lid when you insert the diaper. However, any soil marks would easily wipe clean with a baby wipe.This pail is easy to use. You press the built-in pedal with your foot, the outer lid opens, and there is an inner trap door into the pail. While it technically is hands-free, I prefer to push the inner lid into the pail open with one finger rather than tossing the diaper onto it and having the weight of the diaper open the lid. This way, the diaper doesn't come in contact with the inner lid and it stays clean.Regarding the refill bags, this was something I worried about when buying this diaper disposal system. I have found that as long as you have refills on hand, it really isn't a hassle. So far I've bought the 2-pack refills on Amazon, but I've also seen them at Babies R Us. We are on our 6th refill (meaning we've bought 3 2-pack refills) in the time that we've had this pail. The refills are easy to insert (just be sure to follow the instructions on the refill) and the full bags are easy to take out.This diaper pail has been a great investment, and I would highly recommend this product."
149122,1,"Wife asked me to buy this after her own research and loves this pillow. Says that it helps her sleep much better. Comes with a cover that can be removed and washed. Shipped in a huge but lightweight box. The only complaint is where her neck meets the pillow. The stitching / pillow case has more room so the stuffing material slides inside a bit but the pillow case or cover's seam remains stiff and press against her neck while sleeping. We tried wrapping the neck/head portion with a soft towel as fix for now. It's hard to describe and I hope you get what I mean. I haven't checked but it could be the cover and not the pillow itself. Regardless, she won't use the pillow without the cover so, it is a problem and loses one star. Otherwise, it is a great product that helps her very much."
141136,1,Granddaughter loved the toy but also loved being confident with it's handles to learn to walk.denise
2791,1,"this product is good for everyone. it is made for nursing but it is good for many other tasks. we use it to help our 5 year old hold the baby, the baby likes to sleep in it and just sit and stare. it will be usefull for more than just the first few months and it is easy to clean!!!"
46727,1,"This is the third swing my great granddaughter has had. The others almost stopped rocking as she gained weight(she just turned 5 months)but this swing is still going. It's good looking, sturdy, and we love it."
120410,1,"I am so glad I invested in this product. I wanted this from day one, but I bought a regular monitor, which is fantastic. I just wanted the peace of mind that if our son stopped breathing in his sleep or was taken out of his crib that we would have an alarm go off. In this day and time that we live in we cannot trust anyone with our children, not even in your home. I bought this for him at 7 months out of fear of sids. He is a very healthy baby, but sometimes that is not even factored in. Anyway, take the advice of the plywood under the mattress(as stated in the directions) This is a fantastic product. Our son sleeps and breaths very quietly, so I know when he is not moving or in case he stops breathing. The alarm went off only 2 times and it was the scare of a lifetime, but knowing that I could run quickly across the hall to him was a welcomed relief when the alarm went off. I recommend this product to all expecting mothers. I wish a friend of mine would have had one, maybe her child would still be alive. The only thing is that I find the monitor is not that clear sounding, needs more volume, so I just keep the other monitor on and leave the sounds part on this one.....a fantastic investiment for any parents.Thanks! :)"
75763,1,The nursery for my brand new grand-daughter is now finished. My daughter decorated the room with the CoCaLo Sugar Plum theme and the lamp was the last piece it needed - it is picture perfect (just like the baby!)
22137,0,I purchased these bags assuming that the higher cost of the Medela bags would be justified by outstanding quality. I was wrong. I spent so much of my time pumping so that my son could drink stored breastmilk after he was weaned to a bottle and now I see all of the effort and those precious minutes of pumping leaking out of the bags. I let the bags defrost in the refrigerator. So many of the bags have leaked and made a mess out of the refrigerator and its contents that I now put the bags that are defrosting into a 9 x 13 pan to catch the leaking milk. At least 1 out of every ten bags has leaked out of the bottom of the bag. My recommendation would be to buy a cheaper bag and not to be surprised if the bags leak.
146125,1,Our 4-month-old son has only been in this a day but we're already sold!! He is far from bored in it which allows mom to get some things done while he happily bounces around learning new skills and exploring. He's still a bit short for it so we put a box under his feet but we're sure he'll grow into it. And the music is catchy and cute. It was easy to put together as well.
152147,1,We just purchased this set a few weeks ago and it is just A*D*O*R*A*B*L*E !!! w/ beautiful accents through out the bumper pads and comforter! Looks very durable and feels strong. The mobile is also pretty sturdy. Great pick for either a boy or a girl!
176535,1,The drop in system is all we use for our daughter and I just love it. I will keep on using it and recommending it highly. So far we have not used the 8-oz bottles but maybe in the future. These nipples are far superior in my opinion because they're such a natural shape.
40338,0,"I used to buy swaddlers and liked them. But when it is time to switch I tried cruisers on my baby, and I did not like them with the quality."
18755,2,"We have the Halo, SwaddleMe and Miracle Blanket for our 3 week old. They also gave us another Halo in the hospital as a going-home gift. The Halo is the best out of the three, particularly for the middle of the night diaper changes. I love that I do not have to take the baby completely out of the Halo to change his diaper. I also love that the swaddle portion comes off, which is great when my baby is too hot or wants his arms free. The only downside is that the micro fleece version can be a bit bulky and bunch up a little under the baby's face. I use the velcro safety straps, so it is never high enough to smother him.The SwaddleMe is the next best. I love its simplicity, but you have to take it off to change a diaper.The Miracle Blanket is the worst. It is way too complicated to wrap. It does not have velcro or snaps to keep it closed, so you have to tuck it; and you have to take it off to change a diaper. It is the least bulky of the three. However, that is not necessarily a good thing in the cold, midwest winter."
113249,1,"Before I ordered this set, I used the Mustela Vitamin Barrier Cream (diaper cream) on DS and I absolutely love it, therefore I want to try more things from Mustela, and this set is a good start. Unlike the picture showed, my gift set came with a free bib, and it looks good on DS! The only product came with trial size was the Demo Cleansing Gel (bath gel), and after I tried a several times on DS, I bought the regular size for him, it was gentle on his skin and washed very clean but left his skin very soft, and smells nice and clean. I used to use California Baby's Calming Shower Gel, and it dries DS's hair and made it so much static, it actually made his hair gets greaser easily and didn't help with his cradle cap. After I used Mustela foam Shampoo for newborn, it made his hair soft and manageable again and smelled so nice, and cured his cradle cap in two days, I love it! I also used the Physi-o-bebe (cleansing water) but didn't like it as much as the other products in the set, because it left the skin sticky. Since I already used diaper cream, I just keep this new one on my diaper bag."
17857,1,"She's 7 months and the batteries have just now needed replacing. She can turn it on all by herself now by kicking the huge buttons or if i give her the remote. And it's so high there is no way she can get herself tangled in it, so it is not a hazard! At first I thought it was too stimulating for her but now it is just what she needs to entertain herself while I get 30 minutes more sleep"
92285,2,"I received these for a shower gift. Two of the three bottles leaked terribly, and when I e-mailed and called the company they basically said take them back to the store. Well, they'd been used!! No aplology, nothing! Very disappointed!"
42246,0,"Some people might prefer long enough baby carrier, but this is way too long. It takes some time to wrap all the carrier around the body."
74434,1,Great item. These easy grasp utensils are so easy for my daughter to use while she's mastering feeding herself. I'd recommend especially if your child is having issues grasping.
184304,0,"The concept of this product is great, but it did not work for us. We have queen bed and with this between us, my husband and I were very uncomfortable.It requires seperate bedding for me and my husband - this was not very practical for us. We used it a couple of times and then stopped. For the times we used it the baby seemed very comfortable.This may be more practical if you have a king size bed."
94771,1,"I bought these to use as baby wipes for my newborn granddaughter, who visited from overseas. My daughter prefers not to use pre-moistened wipes, if possible. The wipes were a perfect size, although they did shrink by about 15% in the wash. They were soft, and easy to manage one-handed. We just kept a stack along-side a bowl of water on the changing table and tossed them used into the laundry basket; we did baby laundry daily anyway so that was no problem. My daughter liked them well-enough to take them home for regular use!"
105371,2,I do admit I like the idea of using regular trash bags but the oder that it leaves is horrible. I couldn't stand the smell any longer and got rid of the Diaper Champ! It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT NEWBORNS DO NOT HAVE SMELLY DIAPERS! So of course you will not smell anything until your little one starts to eat more solid foods. It is just disgusting! I highly recommend saving yourself $30 and taking the trash out once a day.
120824,1,"I have a toddler so we recently had to completely baby-proof our house. We have purchased a number of baby gates, and this was by far the BEST! I just wish we bought this first so I could have bought every gate in the house to be like this!! It is worth the money hands down.PROS:-This gate is STURDY! My 16 month old stood up and shook it, and it didn't even budge. Even when I put my weight on it, it doesn't move. Awesome.-Easy one-handed operation! I have two other gates that claim they are easy to open/close. Not true. But this gate really lives up to its promise. You simply slide the button over and lift up, then swing it open.-Dual swing. It can swing both in and out, which is convenient. Also, it shuts behind you (but not slams, but it does LOCK). And my daughter had her fingers by the gate and I didn't realize and when it went to close I *cringed* realizing it might crunch her fingers. It didn't even come close. There was enough room that her fingers can be by the gate and not get smushed.-It's quiet. I don't have to worry about waking anyone up or it making a huge amount of noise. I can get in and out without my daughter noticing. Amazing!-Great for high traffic! I have this gate btwn my family room and kitchen, so it gets A LOT of use. Works great!CONS:-A little more pricey than the cheapest gates on the market (it's still cheaper than a lot of gates, and worth every penny!).Really, it's a no-brainer. I highly recommend this gate. I can't talk highly enough about it. It's so easy and simple to use (not like my other gate that I have to use two hands to open/close and is noisy). I specifically came back to review this product because I love it so much. I will definitely get more in the future!!"
12635,1,Basic stroller. It does what I need it to. It is tough to get things in and out of the storage compartment when the seats are in place.
129356,2,My baby had this since she was 6 months old and she is now 13-months-old. Until recently she liked to chew on everything she could get her hands on except this toy. She would always get bored of it within a minute or two.
56594,0,"I really liked this lock, I bought it to keep my dog out of the fridge, and it worked perfectly for that and for keeping my two year old out. The problem is my four year old jerked on the door and the lock broke.So, If it's for a toddler this will work well for you, but older kids can and probably will break it."
148213,1,"My baby loves it. He can stay in his chair for hours and he enjoys its music and lights. He doesn't like the vibration, but I don't care about it. I recomend it and I will keep it for my next baby."
128238,1,"I loved using these on my newborn. Newborns are slippery and like to wiggle in the tub. I was having so much difficulty holding my daughter and trying to get baby wash on a wash cloth with my other hand. With these, the soap is already on the cloth. Just wet, use and toss. It's perfect!"
160231,0,"My baby outgrew this very very quickly. We could only use it twice! While the swaddle was tight - we called it a baby straightjacket - it is so easy to swaddle with a good receiving blanket. We learned how to make a tight swaddle from Happiest Baby on the Block and the Koala Baby receiving blankets are big enough to do the trick! She can't break out of that swaddle either. It is a cheaper, more long lasting alternative."
30058,2,"I was hopeful this product would work wonders and I'd have a happy baby in my arms in no time. Well, it didn't. It's easy to use - just microwave the little pouch and put it inside the belt, put the belt on the baby. Easy, right? Well, the belt is bulky and looks like it could be uncomfortable...and my baby just screamed louder when we got near her with it. In fact, when we took it away we had better luck with her calming down. I got rid of it since it didn't work."
107920,0,"I've had the Isis for about six months now, and I'm lucky to get 2 - 3 oz. at a time with it. I bought it as an alternative to my Medela Pump-In-Style, and I wish I hadn't wasted my money. After being used to getting 12 - 16 oz. from the PIS, the Isis is especially frustrating. Also, taking all the small parts apart to clean each time is time-consuming. I'm just really disappointed in the Isis, especially after reading such wonderful recommendations for it. I've been breastfeeding for almost nine months now and I work full-time, and the PIS works much better for me."
30531,2,"We bought the whole rainforest line which is so cute but this just didn't work out for us. From the get go the hammock part never supported our son. His back would hit ackwardly on the hard plastic bump below meant for use with older babies. No matter how tight we got the straps he still sunk too far down. He was 7lbs 9 oz. when he was born and we've been using this since his cord fell off. He is just now at 2 months 10 lbs. so weight was not the issue. We've now tried a couple of times without the hammock attachment. It's better but still not great. He seems to slip side to side and it does seem pretty short, water spills over the back when we try to rinse his head. I wouldn't reccommend this tub. There may be better options but I say save your money for other things and do like we do, my husband takes him in the shower with him and he loves it :). We won't be trying any others."
144315,1,How lucky could one be??? Best car seat around to keep my little one safe and the Gators to go along with it! this seat is hard to find but SO worth it!
43703,1,"I bought this extention at the same time as the handsfree gate. My house has 36"" doors and the gate alone was too narrow. This extention makes it work, completes the look and keeps the strenght of the gate. If you're planning to use the handsfree gate in a wide door or hallway this is a must have."
71050,0,"My mother in law has this seat and I thought I wanted one until this weekend, my second child is now sitting up and officially hates this chair. It doesn't allow the baby to lie down (seated recline instead), and you also can't secure it in an upright position. So, my newly sitting but not quite steady baby was either uncomfortable because he was fighting the chair to sit up, or fighting not to rock. He loved it as a newborn though, and my toddler loves to sit in it when we're over."
178174,1,"I love this changing table. I was very worried about ordering one online because I couldn't touch it to feel how sturdy it was but this one is very sturdy and heavy. I put mine together on Thursday morning and had my baby that night so I'm glad I didn't have to worry with sending back a cheaply made product. I put the table together by myself and I would recommend getting someone to help you or it will be quite frustrating holding all the pieces together. I would recommend this to product to anyone, it's great."
115141,1,"I like that it comes with two sizes of extensions. Also, by being tall, the tension piece is able to meet the flat part of your stair's newell post, so you don't have to narrow your gate searching to those with Y connectors. It also automatically closes, or you can gently place it so that it doesn't latch. This comes in handy when you know you're going up or down the stairs with your hands full the next time through. It opens either direction. The tension pieces fit inside optional screw on cups. In our old house, it was at the bottom of the stairs without the screw on cups, and it did come out of alignment if slammed shut or bumped hard with the gate open. We have it at the top of our stairs (split level) in our new house with the screw on cups installed and haven't had a problem with it coming out of alignment. Like any other metal swinging product, it does need to be oiled once a year to keep from squeaking. It is by far my favorite gate of the 3 we have."
117279,1,"Just installed this gate, and the extra-wide gate, in our family room openings. The wood is just the right color to blend with my darker wood trim, and my lighter hardwood floors. They are very nice looking, sturdy, and easy to operate. I found installing them very straight forward, but it may be a little more complicated if you need to add an inch or two. The instructions include several options to make the gate work for all of the dimensions.The parts are all solid and well made, in the USA! These gates far exceeded my expectations!"
83702,2,"I bought this at the recommendation of a nursing consultant because my baby wouldn't latch on properly. I knew I was wasting my money when I purchased it, but decided to go for it since it didn't cost much. This product is what it is - just a little piece of plastic. It didn't work any miracles for us with breastfeeding, and it didn't help my baby latch on at all."
19697,1,"My son is almost 3 months old now and ever since I was pumping and now formula feeding, it's been so helpful. We have a 2 story house so it's especially nice at night, when we only have to walk from our bedroom to our baby's room and take the bottle out of the cooler and put it in the warmer, and we're ready to go as soon as his diaper is changed. I'm surprised it's only $30 as a matter of fact. My mom stayed with us for 5-6 weeks after the baby was born and she couldn't get over how great it was. I'd recommend it to anyone. We were traveling for a week and a half and it came it very handy at the hotels, too."
148057,1,"It's always nice to have various options for baby - a swing, time on the floor, a bouncer, etc. This seat gets my nephew excited and helps wear him out. I appreciate the various levels for the music and jungle sounds.As others have mentioned, the top bar clicks. I also wish there was a setting to turn on the lights and waterfall movement only. If we're close to nap time I'd like to switch to a calming mode and just let him fall asleep.But - it's a nice bouncer for babies under 20 lbs. I think larger babies would bottom-out. :)"
171195,2,"This tub was ok for the first 2-3 months, but by then I found that I had a lot of issues. Once my daughter could hold her head up, she did not want to lean back on the support mat for the infant side, but she could not sit up well enough for the toddler side. She slid around in it alot, and the plastic was so hard, that I feared she would whack her head when she looked from side to side. Once she could sit up, I tried it again, and she was too big. It was awkward, and uncomfortable for both of us. I would skip over this item, and go straight for a bath cushion."
67271,0,"This gate is decent enough for us to keep, but I am not completely happy with it. The more it is extended, the less secure it feels. It took a little bit for me to get accustomed to unlocking and locking it. Even after I got used to it, it still seems to require a lot of pressure to get it locked into place and tight enough that I feel it is secure. We haven't had any problems with our child getting past the gate, so we have kept it. It is reasonably priced and does work--I just think there are probably more user friendly gates available."
79983,1,"This thermos works really well for our baby. We use this thermos to carry hot water for formula. The water stays hot for up to 5 hours. I removed the drinking straw from the container, and I use the straw in the lid as a pouring spout. I am able to mix formula in a moving car without fear of spilling hot water over myself. Great for road trips, and his daily visit to the park. And when our baby learns to sip from a straw he'll be able to use it like it was meant to be used. Very glad I bought it."
105109,2,"At first I thought that this diaper pails was wonderful, it kept in the stink and used regular garbage bags. Well, I was wrong, it smells so horrible that I am throwing it out and I am buying a Diaper Genie. The smell is so nasty that I just can't take it anymore. Changing it is even worse; the smell attacks you when you open it and lingers for a long time. Please don't buy this waste of money."
101080,0,They are diapers! I am not sure what else to say. They hold poop and pee. Good Job.
68636,0,"I don't think it's very well insulated, but it's large enough to carry a bottle, and a pacifier, which is convenient."
63529,1,"[[ASIN:B000NW0AY6Extremely pleased grandmother! I was so excited with this item, after I received the first one I ordered, I order another one! Gave the first one to my daughter and order a second one for myself! They are so cute, when I unbuckle my granddaughter from the car seat she grabs the mirror and hugs it!"
48682,1,"I purchased this product to put around the Christmas tree to keep a busy baby out of it. The gate is tall enough, sturdy and has plenty of room inside for little ones to play. Shipping was super quick. I received the item less than 24 hours after placing the order!"
124002,0,"It's not sturdy, feels like the wheels will come off because they just snap on.Definitely no an everyday stroller, good for a quick trip. You get what you for."
108651,0,My son is 6 weeks old. I purchased the lamp 5 weeks ago and the button does not work to turn the lamp on or off. The lamp is on and I have to unplug it when I want it off.
1694,1,"One thing I can state about diapers as a mother of 2 and a grandmother of 1 is that you can NEVER go by the poundage shown for the diaper fit. My experience has been that the children go into the size well BEFORE they are in the poundage recommended. I have also found that it really depends on the build of the child as to which brand works best for them. We have tried the major brands on our granddaughter and found that PAMPERS works best for her and we have no leakage problems.Pampers Baby Dry Diapers, Size 6, 128-Count"
62924,0,Hubby bought this for me early in my third trimester to encourage me sleep on my sides and less on my back. I'm 5'1 with a normal belly (neither carry small or big) and this pillow took up a lot of space in our queen bed. The pillow is very puffy and I just couldn't get comfortable sleeping on it. I've turned it about every which way and it just didn't work out in the early 3rd trimester. I have tried all the positions from the pictures and just can't get comfortable with it. I revisited this pillow after 35 weeks when I needed more belly support. Still the snoogle was too puffy and it actually hurt my sides laying on it and my baby kicked a lot when i laid on the pillow. At 37 weeks now and I have been sleeping with the snoogle mini for a couple of nights straight. It is somewhat comfortable for a few hours but when I need to switch sides I have to turn the pillow the other way. Kind of a hassle. I also get really tangled in it when I sleep too. Not sure if this was worth the money. I'm going to try and purchase a wedge to see if it's any better.
70418,1,"I am totally satisfied with this carseat. It was a bit tricky getting it installed in the car (I recommend reading the instructions, and having an extra set of hands to help you install it) but all carseats can be a bit tricky.My 7 month old son loves this carseat because it sits higher up than his first seat and he can see outside (this makes our road trips MUCH more pleasant).There are lots of places for you to adjust the straps, buckle, and headrest so you can really make the seat fit your baby. I am not sure how well it would work for a newborn because it doesn't recline as far as carseats that are only rear-facing, and it might make it harder for your little one to take naps and keep his head in a comfortable position. (Plus, it is SO nice to have a carseat with a detachable base for a brand new baby so you don't have to wake them up when they are sleeping). But if you only want one carseat, I am sure a neck support pillow in the carseat would work great for newborns.My favorite feature of this carseat is that I won't have to keep buying more carseats (and then find a place to store the old ones) until my son is old enough to ride without one!"
99224,1,"We have tried different diapers, but Pampers seem to be the best. They are soft, keep our baby dry and happy, and the velcro tabs are the best! I highly recommend them."
95599,1,"I just got done redoing my little girls room for part of her Christmas.She walked in last night and glanced around at the $1000 of new furniture, bedding, etc. - and her eyes went straight up to the corners of her room where I had 2 of these nets hanging with all of her stuffed animals in them. She squealed and said &#34;I always wanted these in my room!&#34;SO I guess I could have saved a lot of money and she would have been just as happy with a few stuffed animal hammocks.Anyway ... these are great!"
19903,1,it works real good . very nice quality . . . . . . . . . .. . .
16123,1,"So I bought this blanket with an Easter picnic in mind. Our church always has an Easter celebration at one of our members' farm and with a 15 month old I figured something to sit on would be great. I can't express my delight with this purchase enough. We purchased the red/grey and received so many complements. It was heavy enough that we didn't have to weigh down the corners, but when it was time to go the wet grass wiped right off and it folded up perfectly. What the picture doesn't show is that the ""fold"" seams are sewn so you can fold it up perfectly every time. It fit perfectly under the stroller and the built in handle was great after that.This has been one of my favorite, most versitile, purchases in a long time."
26444,0,"We borrowed this from a relative to use as a secondary bassinet in our family room for our newborn. While it serves its purpose so our little one can be in the same room, it does severely lack in features. The music feature is poor quality, and does not have a timer. The rocking feature is manual. The mattress pad support is very poor, I recommend buying a rectangular bassinet pad/mattress for additional support. If you want a great bassinet loaded with features for the same price, I highly recommend The First Years Carry Me Near 5-in-1 Sleep System."
98499,0,"it's cute set, but I don't use most of the items in the set. don't waiste your money..."
133365,1,"We love Born Free! Our daughter is 5 months old, and she is holding the bottles all by herself without a problem. The only gripe is having to clean so many parts, but we love having a BP-A free product."
126378,1,"So far these diapers have been absolutely fantastic. Compared to some of the other products available, they're very low profile, and have an above average absorbency. For some reason the pampers were causing a lot of skin irritation, which was leading to a lot of night time crying that was making it impossible to sleep. Since making the switch to huggies, the crying has almost completely stopped. I wish they were a little bit bigger, but I suppose the tradeoff is that they might be obvious to strangers as I generally wear fitted jeans."
125718,1,"Item was recd. in record time, and was just as described in details I couldn't be happier. It was a gift and the recepients were thrilled with the product also."
31894,1,"I strongly recommend this product. I tried most of the baby carriers out there with my wife and we decided to pay the extra and buy this one. The main reason is that this model (Baby Carrier Active) has a tremendous back support other models don't have. Baby Carrier Active has easy snap function which helps you to put and remove the baby very easily. We believe it's worth the money especially if you have already decided to get the Baby Bjorn Baby Carrier (not the Active one, the light version). It is also a good investment if you are planning to walk around the city with your little one."
39290,1,"These are nice blankets: very soft, good size, durable. BUT they pill like crazy leaving lint absolutely everywhere on the first washing. Make sure you separate your laundry carefully! Carters (or The First Years) didn't have that problem."
90168,1,Great deal!! They arrived in less time than quoted to my door! You just can't go wrong with Pampers and I am loving Amazon!! :)
149656,1,We love this bedding set. My daughter is now 20 months old and she adores all the animals. Everything is high quality. I have no complaints at all.
37883,0,"This product is great for the first time parent, and like some of the reviews, NOT ALL HOSPITALS GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED!!! It is diffrent from hospital to hospital. I suggest to check with your local hospital that you are giving birth in. Your doctor will tell you what you will recive. This product was recommended to me by my doctor and pediatrition. (though the quality could be better) but remember you get what you pay for."
67908,2,"I have to say that there is only one thing I like about this play mat and that is the zip up feature. Other than that... I hate it and I am so glad I did not pay for this!The Good:- The zip up feature - but after a wash or two the zipper starts sticking and becomes a pain to zip up.The Bad:- The arch is light as can be and totally flimsy... it keeps falling over onto my babies face!!! This alone is enough for me to veto this mat.- The colors fade after just one wash- The toys are totally BORING and so is the pattern. The toy arch has nothing engaging about the colors or the solid blue pattern.- Not engaging at all for babies... mine actually cries when I put her in it, verses the other play mat by Tiny Love she LOVES and stay in it happily until I get her.- The way you attached the arch is not easy and honestly... it is stupid how it is designed.- The size of this mat is small compared to our other Tiny Love one which is about 4x's the size.- The photo makes it look at soft and cushy... but it is not. One wash and it flattens completely out.- The toy arch is so light that the baby can literally push it over once crawling starts so add that to the size of the mat and that makes this mat only good for about 5 months... once your baby is mobile this mat is out... not to mention that once they try to use the zipper as toy it can become dangerous... which lead me too...- If you have older siblings around toddler age they will try to play with the zipper feature of the mat. Not good when (like my two year old) they can zip their finger by accident.- Not only is it small but it is so small that your baby will not be able to roll over on it. The toy arch will stop them from rolling over which is a big milestone that you do not want to inhibit. Also most do not want their baby rolling off onto the floor.I am sure I could find more reason why you should run away from this product but I think I have spend enough time on this poorly designed, majorly flawed, joke of a play mat. We have two Tiny Love Play Mats and LOVE LOVE LOVE them. Spend the extra 30.00... it is worth it beyond words. One of our Tiny Love mats is 6 years old and still works great, colors are as vibrant as the day we bought it and our 2 year old still plays with it!"
152997,2,"I was not a fan of these at all. First of all there is a huge chance I'm going to lose the key at some point. Also, for many of my cupboards they would not fit together properly to lock (I followed the instructions well)."
158807,1,"my 16mo son has been using halo sleep sacks since birth and we are big fans. he's now walking so i thought about getting the kind with the foot holes but didn't like the fabric options that style comes in. i decided to go with the puppy print as i thought my son would like it (and therefore be less inclined to fight going to bed, which has worked out for us a couple of times!). other reviewers have commented on the sizing running large -- i love that the sleepsack is so roomy. the x-large is meant for 18-24mos but i feel like it's the perfect size for my 32-33"" son so that his legs don't get cramped in the bottom of the sack. we were previously using a large which he still fit into but it just looked too cramped to be comfortable."
169253,1,"All of our babies have different body types, my daughter didn't leak with Huggies newborn with the u shaped cut out. Then when she hit size 2, I could only buy pampers swaddlers. Their super soft, and super absorbent, they move with the body. Just perfect."
90367,1,"This is the biggest box of diapers that I can find in my area and it's tough for me to get to the store so having these delivered to my door is amazing. They do ship directly in the box, as is, in the picture. So if you live in a condo/apt/etc. and need privacy with your packages or are concerned that someone might take them, maybe not a good idea?"
96856,0,"The Sleep Sheep is a great product, except for a huge design flaw. The buttons to turn the music on and off are on the back, which makes it difficult to reach them because the animal is meant to be strapped to a surface such as a crib or swing. You have to move it every time you turn the music on or off. **The on-the-go Sleep Sheep has the buttons on the side rather than the back, which is a perfect design. It has the same great features as the regular size but without the design flaw of button-location. It is just a little smaller in size. If you are interested in this product, I highly recommend you buy the on-the-go version to save yourself a great deal of frustration."
145876,1,"We bought this for our three month old. The first time we put her in it she just sat there for a minute or two before wanting out. However, it wasn't too long afterward that she started jumping around in it and staring at all the toys. Now she is four months old and loves to spend time in it and grab at the toys. It was very easy to put together and the seat cover is easily removable when it needs to be washed. There are a number of colorful toys on it that my daughter really enjoys, including the music and sounds. My only complaint is that on even the lowest setting my daughter can't reach the floor with her feet right now. We fixed that by putting a sturdy, four-legged stool underneath her feet. It is really a nice product to have!"
70473,0,"My son liked using this. I didn't. It leaked all over the bag I was carrying it in. When I open this to refill it, it usually splashes from the lid and makes a mess. There is usually some liquid trapped between the layers on top which makes it hard to clean.On the other hand, it is easy to hold by the handles and it is easy for my son to drink from.Nevertheless, I don't plan on buying any more of these."
107293,0,"I got this diaper pail as a shower gift, cause thats what I wanted. It works good, for holding a lot of diapers. But after some time it starts to smell. I have used sprays, deoderizers, air freshners, etc., it takes care of the smell for a couple hours, then it comes back. I have taken it outside and washed it out and then let it air dry, but that still didn't work. I still use it, and just put up with the smell. So I don't know if I would recommend it or not."
170861,0,"These sheets are highly overpriced. You can get generic sheets from Target for 1/2 the price. The sheets fit well and have kept their color, but since the sheets will constantly get soiled and are very thin, you mind-as-well save your money and get the cheaper ones. You may not find your exact color, but otherwise, its the same sheet."
150440,2,"These are not 100% cotton, package says 80% cotton, 20% poly. They aren't that soft, either. Returned these. Try Aden and Anais muslin wash cloths if you're looking for soft. They're expensive, but after two washings they're like butter."
151294,2,"The mirror worked great for several months, then suddenly one day, without warning and without having been touched the mirror fell off of the base. We could not pop it back on. It is a ball and socket connection. Now I have a hunk of junk and have to find a new, better mirror. Perhaps if you know the exact angle you need the mirror at, you can super glue it back in, meaning it would no longer be adjustable, but then it would never fall off again!"
43234,0,"My daughter loved it. When you travel by air you have to take the car seat, so why take a big stroller when you can just take the frame? Its great, however I wish you could turn the seat facing forward also."
62155,2,"We inherited a 10 year old ""City Savvy"" Combi stroller and loved it. It was incredibly light, approx 5 lbs, and manueverable (could be steered with one hand). But after the wheel fell off for the 15th time, we decided to buy a new stroller. I was so happy with our old cloth Combi that I was determined to stick with that brand. I thought the new strollers were quite cute.Unfortunately, I ended up returning our new Combi after just a few weeks. Full disclosure: our new stroller turned out to be defective, so this obviously colored my opinion, but I think I would have returned it anyway. Why?The new lightweight strollers are too heavy. They've added a lot of features, but added the lbs as well, defeating the purpose of a lightweight travel stroller that you can just throw in your car, carry up and down the front steps multiple times a day, etc.The wheels have gone downhill. What used to be nice solid wheels are now those hollow plastic jobs, almost like a toy stroller. They did it to reduce the weight, but they seem flimsy, like they would last a winter of use. Our stroller didn't track straight (granted, it was defective, so who knows...maybe they aren't usually that hard to steer).The hallmark of the Combi is one-handed steering with the bar. The new bar was so big in circumference, that it made it awkward to hold and steer with one hand.The nylon fabric is so lightweight that it doesn't hold its shape, i.e. the sun canopy seems to collapse. Granted, our old cloth one wasn't waterproof, etc, but it felt sturdier than this new lightweight nylon.The reclining mechanism felt flimsy...it is just a cord with a sleeping bag type pull on it.The seat seemed too narrow.As you can see, I'm comparing it the my original little Combi, so that might not be fair, but I think the company has tried to add lots of bells and whistles while keeping costs down, and have sacrificed basic engineering and quality."
64882,1,"We registered for this swing because a friend suggested we have a take-along swing and a big one. We use the big papasan swing downstairs, and this one in the office upstairs. He loves looking at the lights on it if you dim the lights in the room, and will sometimes nap in it. The only thing I don't like is that the lights are so high above their head, soemtimes they don't look that far up."
181014,1,I bought this for my grandson and he love's it! He talks to all the animals and love to grab them. This gym is very well made and worth every penny!
125602,1,"My son is now a year old. We got this when his first teeth were coming in around 5 months. He has found his way back to it every time he has new teeth coming through. I recall that when we first got it he occasionally gagged himself on the green handle (sticking it in backwards) -- perhaps the loop should be shorter, but over all he loves it and I will recommend it to anyone. Other teethers were too much for him to handle. This is perfect because it's so easy to hold on to while he's moving around. It is not appropriate for use as a pacifier. It's too big to suck on."
32606,0,"I needed a gate set up that would accommodate an irregular opening in my house to prevent my 2 year old twin boys from entering the kitchen without proper adult supervision. This gate seems to do the job well. Is easy to attach and position. The only comment is that it's not heavy enough on it's own to keep it's shape. A 2 year old can push a segment enough to move one segment position relative to another. The position locking mechanism between panels is not all that strong and when you want to open the gate, you actually loosen the positioning locking mechanism enough to make moving panels even easier. The solution I found was to tie wrap 10 lb weights to the joints between panels so they are not so easy to move about."
179288,0,its ok i dont prefer them to tommie tip bottles but good for the price. wouldnt recommend to friends. i feel they are hard to use and too many extra pieces to put together and wash.
142184,1,"Set aside the obvious reasons for purchasing a baby carrier, the BABYBJORN Carrier is definitely worth consideration. It is well a made product, with good stitching and sturdy fabric. The carrier is comfortable to wear, even for extended periods of time. Essentially, it is the same as having an extra set of arms to hold your baby. The carrier is a little cumbersome to adjust after putting it on. The lumbar support is difficult to position and can create slack in the should straps. There are no instructions or diagrams in regards to lumbar support positioning and adjustment. This is the only element I have a complaint with, and the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. However, once the straps and lumbar support have been adjusted properly, the carrier is a priceless help concerning daily baby care. I would highly recommend this product to all parents, new or experienced."
149326,1,"First off, other people stated that the ""crease/ seam"" at the top of the pillow cuts into their shoulder, my wife is only 5 foot 2 and she said it doesnt bother her at all.Now my review,Wife loves it, I personally think its super comfortable, and im 6ft, but now she wont part from it. So guys expect to be even more of a servant to your prego.Product arrived on time and issues at all.Thanks!"
119666,2,"This monitor is doing a great service for the 9-volt battery industry. The receiver goes through one every couple of days. Not a big deal, really, considering it comes with an AC adapter for the receiver. Which brings up another great service this piece junk provides - When I plug it in, I have to hold it in the air, jump up and down and try several positions to get reception (and by reception, I mean static). All that stretching and twisting makes me nice and limber for the million trips up and down the stairs to check on baby since the monitor doesn't actually work. I have to say, it is helping me shed the extra pounds. Baby loved the light show and the music, but after a week or so, the projector started to cut out and only the music still plays. So, I guess what we are left with is a $40.00 box that plays tinny music.So basically, I would highly recommend this item to anyone who enjoys tinny music, exercising and spending a lot of money to support the battery industry.I would not recommend this item to anyone who actually needs a baby monitor."
163858,0,"This was for my third child. I have only bought a real high chair for my second child, and thought it took up too much space. For all three I have used high chairs that attach to the dining room chair. This product saves a lot of space in the dining room. I love that it reclines and is easy to wash. However, at 6 months old, in its furthest position, the tray sits too close to the baby. She can't move her arms out from under the tray. I am wondering how squishy she is going to be when she gets bigger."
14712,2,"These bottles are certainly NOT worth the money. They leak if you don't screw them just right! After buying dozens of these bottles in 4oz. and 9oz. because I wanted the best for my newborn and I thought these were the best, I was very upset about the loss of money as they are expensive. Eight out of ten times I used the bottle, it leaked. After the bottle leaked warm milk all over my newborn's face, my husband and I had had enough. I called customer service to complain and spend about ten minutes listening to the rep. tell me about how to screw the top on just right. It's just not worth it!!!!!!!!!"
106905,1,"This diaper pail is wonderful at first. You can use regular kitchen garbage bags in it so you don't have to buy the expensive refills like with the Diaper Genie. Early on, when your baby's diapers don't smell too bad, this diaper pail is great. However, once your baby starts eating solid foods, you may need to invest in something like a Diaper Genie. My daughter started eating solids about 3 months ago and we're still using the Diaper Champ without any problems but we have an air filter RIGHT next to it. When we first started using the Diaper Champ, we sometimes noticed an odor when it was starting to get full (but really we only noticed it smelling on rare occasions). Now, the only time I notice an odor is when the air filter needs to be replaced.The Diaper Champ is tall - like a kitchen garbage can - but not any bigger around than a Diaper Genie. One thing I had a hard time with at first was getting the thing open to change the bag. But, after opening it a few times, I got good at it and don't have any problems anymore. All in all, I would recommend the Diaper Champ to any new parents, mostly for the cost savings where bags are concerned."
70510,1,"My son is 23 lbs and very active and only 7 months, He has pretty much outgrown his swing which he loved so much. I bought him this rocker and it's just wonderful. If you pull on the toy it plays music, it has vibration and multiple positions, it's perfect and so economical too, we love it! And it holds up to 40 lbs. It's also just far enough back for him to feed himself like he did in his swing."
11765,1,"My 7-month old loves this! We give her cut up chunks of fruit, and she will sit in her high chair gnawing on this thing for 20-30 minutes. It's so nice because we can eat our dinner, and she will sit at the table with us without demanding 100% attention. It has been a long time since my husband and I have had a peaceful dinner!I have also stuck an ice cube in here when she had a tooth coming in, and it seemed to comfort her sore gums. One warning: bananas are IMPOSSIBLE to clean out of the mesh."
2256,0,"I bought this for my new niece and thought it was a great offer. The diaper didn't do a great job of contain all of her mess and there was quite a bit of seepage. I recommend going with the Swaddlers, they are a tad bit more expensive but worth every penny"
30654,0,"We initially LOVED this monitor, but now, they don't seem to have the range they did at first. We constantly have to move it or adjust it in order to keep it functioning and not ""beeping"" at us. Very annoying. Not sure why the problem - they are 2 1/2 years old so may just have worn out, but I sure wish they worked as well as they did when we first bought them. I hate to have to throw them out!"
130956,1,"If your going to use cloth, these are great. the extra padding holds up (and in) better,they don't wear thin in the wash and the prefolding is much easier to manage...especially when you have more than one bottom to change!"
22916,1,"My wife loves it, but I bought it so I'm gonna dock a star because it looks uncomfortable for my 3 mo old. Again, wife said it's great, but she's not reviewing and I say the baby looks squished."
52286,1,"I thought I would be dealing with lots of huge messes when I first started potty training my son, but I was pleasantly surprised by these pants. They are much more absorbent than I thought they would be, and they are holding up extremely well despite the number of washings they've been through. Their durability is important to me since my son will be wearing them even after he is completely trained because he's too small for typical underwear. The other advantage to these pants is that they leave no doubt for my son that he's had an accident. They are much more effective than disposable training pants."
25811,0,"I bought these to take on a road trip with us so that they could have juice boxes or Caprisun's while on the road and I didn't have to worry about them squeezing them and getting all over. For the most part these worked well but I could tell that my childern were a little uncomfortable holding them. I'm not sure if it was the way the handles are or not but nevertheless they did work. I wasn't so worried about my 4 year old as I was my 2 year old. My 2 year old still wanted to take the drink out of the holder but when he saw his older brother using it he was fine. They finally got used to them and it saved their car seats from getting juicy but again, I could tell it was a little awkward for them to hold."
148038,1,"I place her in the bouncer after eating, or in the afternoon, and she loves it.It's a big help for when I'm doing home shores."
159379,1,I received this bouncer seat as a shower gift and used it when my daughter was born until she was about 5 months old. The music and fish kept her busy while I did some house work. I put it right on the kitchen table while I made dinner or did dishes. It kept her right there with me. The vibration of it made her calm down when she was crabby. After about 5 months she didn't want to sit in it anymore. The only problem we had with it was when she could lift her body by herself she hung right off the side of it with her head on the floor. Good thing I was right there to get her out of it.
158920,1,"these bottles are a godsend my son is 9 weeks old and doing so much better now that i switched from avent to dr. browns.(i also used playtex, what a pain.) i stared using these when he was 6 weeks old, and from the first feeding it was a completly different baby. he still has a little bit of gas but not as bad as it was before. i reccomend these for all newborns. moms and dads will be happy. i dont even mind washing the extra pieces considering i have a much happier baby."
83764,1,"I was unsure about spending so much money on a placemat for eating out. But I must say, after using it a few times, it is FANTASTIC! I can pull it out of the diaper bag and stick it right to the table. There is a place to catch all the food that falls, and clean up is a cinch. It rolls up and folds into itself for easy storage. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAMILY THAT EATS OUT!"
80487,1,"These are great diapers. They stay in place, are very absorbent, and do not permit leaks."
85057,0,This was not as tough to put together as I had read. It is however flimsy. It just isn't made that well. It will serve the purpose though and it looks really nice. You get what you pay for.
47154,1,"After comparing reviews for all the sit n stands, I decided on the Joovy Ultralight Caboose. I truly love this stoller! I am due in 6 days and my son (3 yrs. 10 mths) wanted to start using it NOW! He loves it! Super easy to turn even with a 2 1/2 yr old up front and my son sitting in the back, I felt no difference. I push it one handed most of the time just because I can! I've tested it with the infant car seat attached and my son says he is still comfortable! I truly love the orange color as well! It looks so chic!Thanks for giving me a stoller that's functional, practical and a head turner Joovy!Melissa"
74200,0,"I have a love hate relationship with my Joovy Caboose. I love that it is short in profile (allowing me to open door and go through by myself), I love that my 3 1/2 year old enjoys sitting and standing on it, I love that my 3 1/2 year old can get on and off easily, and I love that it is made of strong metal (my plastic Graco duoglider broke). I hate that it doesn't have a cup holder, I hate that it has a very small basket that is hard to get to (I can't imaging trying to carry bottles, etc), but mostly I hate the way my 18 month old fits in it. Now my 18 month old daughter is a big girl. She weighs 30 lbs. The bottom seat is much too short, and the foot rest is much too shallow. My daughter's feet always hang over the edge and sometimes get caught in the wheels. I also dislike the straps. If I loosen them my daughter rear end slides forward and makes her really uncomfortable. If I tighten them, then they cut her across the belly.All being said, I still use this stroller. I get asked about my this stroller by passers by at least once a week. I am honest. I don't know whether I recommend it or not. I guess it just depends on what you want."
81632,2,"This worked the very first day perfectly. When we first got it we tested it before the baby came. Now for the real test 10 weeks later, tons of humming. Nothing has changed, nothing running in the house, but there is a nice constant HUMMMMM that never goes away no matter what. I tried running the receiver on batteries and that didn't matter. Based on reviews I'm going to try Sony's ""Baby Call Nursery Monitor - 27 Channel""..stay tuned"
175658,1,"Once growing out of a swaddling blanket, we've used Halo sleepsacks to help our little one sleep. This fleece version is great for winter to help keep babies warm. Our baby is 9mo and around 18lbs and still fits and loves this thing. If she's fussing when going down, she is able to wiggle her arms free, but it generally does the trick if she goes down tired. Nice feature about this style is the removable swaddle wrap. Once the kid no longer needs to have their arms wrapped, you can graduate them to just the sleepsack."
154968,0,"I purchased this after moving to Germany with a 2 month old, 4 year old, and 8 year old. With the amount of walking we do I needed a stroller for my 4 year old to ride on when she gets tired. This was one of the better options since most tandem strollers are very awkward to stear with heavier children. My daughter can't ride in this when I have to lift the front of the stroller to get up on the curb. The stroller needs some tape over some of the frame next to where my daughter hops on. The ends of the frame scratched her a few times. Also the stroller is very hard to get in and out of the van. It is quite long when it collapses. The wheels aren't going to survive the cobblestone streets here very long. The seat also slides back and forth and has to be pulled out several times when my daughter gets in and out. This stroller may be better with a few modifications. I am able to use it but wish there was something better."
137582,1,"After reading reviews, which I always take with a grain of salt, ordered this when the price dropped....I like it, works fine..Yes, the amber is a bit dim, need to have a completely dark room for it--I like the green the best. Our daughter likes to play with it on the foor/bed. I swirl it slowly around her,just above her head, and she tries to grab the stars...cute!"
157219,0,"I received this as a gift and was excited to use it since I had been renting a Medela Symphony for 4 months and didn't want to keep paying $75 a month for a pump. This thing gets the same amount of milk as the Symphony, it just takes twice as long to do so. My morning pump time has increased from 30 minutes to at least an hour each time and my pumps during the rest of the day have gone from 15-20 minutes to 30-35. I go back to work soon and can't afford to take such long breaks so I'm hoping I can find a quicker pump before then. I just ordered the Ameda purely yours and am hoping it works quicker for me. I'll update after using it."
184606,1,"I have the port-a-crib and bought the extra kolcraft mattress. These sheets are soft and fit well. There are not many port-a-crib sheets available and it's good to know that these are good ones. After a few washes they still look fine and fit the extra mattress, too."
84015,0,"Product description is misleading. There is not a single piece of hard wood on this toy box. It is all particle board. Weight limit is 95 lbs, not 100. The toy box is decent for the price however and will serve its purpose well."
180173,1,"I don't write reviews much but I am pleased with this product so much which inspired me to write here.The package says not for daily use but I do use it for twice a day pumping at work and it does the job in a quiet and perfect way. I am mom of single child and this is my first ever breast pump purchase, thanks to Medela I didn't ran into a situation where I had to try a lot of other following this purchase."
132939,1,This is a great diaper bin. It operates great and seems to be well constructed. I have been using it for 2 weeks and so far I love it.
138591,1,This is exactly what I was looking for. My 1-year old loves it. He stares at the ceiling every night looking at the stars until he falls asleep. They appear very clear and bright on the ceiling.
172927,1,"I had a problem with one of them (the seat was broken). I called to the company, and they offered a very efeciente service to me. They sent a new part immediately to me.Thank you very much,Martin Favetto"
93045,1,"These have worked out great for my child care nappers. Having them up of the floor is healthier, in my opinion, and no more accident stains on the carpet is a real plus."
96464,0,"I bought this to keep my cat from opening the door to the study after she mastered the art. It does the job of keeping her out, but it is awkward to operate and has a poor quality feel. The comment others have made about it needing more padding is very true."
107274,2,"we have had multiple problems with this pail giving off too much odor. we have tried to wash it out multiple times, use lysol, baking soda, and even put the diapers in a powder scented bag prior putting them in the pail. when calling the manufacturer they said it was probably a bad seal. they then sent us 2 brand new seals for free-which was wonderful. my husband replaced the seal which didn't solve the problem...so we placed two seals all together and it still continued to smell. we have since then moved it outside which is not very convenient and now the pail doesn't get used very often."
134456,1,"We have a high need, fussy baby and this warmer gave him one less reason to cry! He spits up often during changes, and his diaper isn't quite strong enough for him sometimes, so having warm wipes to take care of these little messes is wonderful! You can always hold the wipe for a while to warm it up, but when you need a warm wipe NOW, this does the job. For those middle-of-the-night changes it's great, cold wipes aren't good on a sleepy bottom. As soon as we got this the fussy diaper changes and wipe-downs were a thing of the past! It is a nice little way to spoil your little one's bottom! We love it!"
20548,1,My daughter loves to play in her Jumperoo. She doesn't stay it for more than 20 or 30 minutes at a time but that is time I can get a few items checked off my to do list. I just wish it took up a little less space.
135353,1,"Ordered this for my daughters bedroom. It arrived during the 5- 10 days as noted, it was as described and in good condition.It added the final touches and it looks great. Now if I could just get her to stay in her crib (lol). :)Thx!"
24334,1,"While these are not Egyptian cotton or silk, they are fitted to the PRECISE measurements of the co-sleeper mattress and extremely easy to change. They fit snugly and securely to the mattress with velcro strips so you do not have to worry about your baby suffocating in loose silky sheets. ;-)They don't shrink, bunch or fall off and that is more that what any other crib sheets I've ever owned do, so I'd say it gets two thimbs up from us!"
18801,0,"The product didn't explain that the handprint side wasn't behind a glass. I have these for my first two children, and both had the clay behind a glass to preserve it. I haven't used the product becaues I'm looking for one with clay protected by the glass."
47544,0,"I don't know why they make it a selling point that it's somehow beneficial to post-op mommies. For me, it was much harder to sit up, twist at the waist and lift my daughter up out of this than it was to just get out of bed. And that's the other thing- if this is attached to your bed, you have to scoot down past it just to get out of bed- not at all easy or enjoyable if you've had a c-section. Aside from that, I will say that as a free standing bassinet, it's sturdy, cute, and great for people with a small bedroom. Folds up compactly for travel although it is a tad heavy."
165639,1,"So awesome to be able to order a large box of diapers online and have it arrive at your doorstep. Love the product, love the service."
66380,1,"i bought this crib bedding for my daughter. When it arrived at first my reaction was "" it is not as colorful as it looks in photo, but when i wash it and set it on the crib it looks fabulous!! It just brighten up my daughter's room. Her crib's color is honey , altogether it looks very bright. I should mention nobody beat this price. It is 100% cotton , very very good quality, bumper pad is thicker than normal available pad. I absolutely recommend to my friends or anybody.."
53434,1,"I bought this to take along to grandparents homes, etc. where there is no high chair for my son. I got when he was maybe 8 mos. old, he is now almost 2 1/2 and I will have to stop using it soon as he reaching the weight limit, and the fabric on one of the arms is begining to rip. I have a couple of issues where it wouldn't fit on a particular table, but got a lot of use out of it. Everyone comments what a great thing it is, and when I say, ""It's the best twenty bucks I've spent on baby stuff."" The response is always, ""It was only twenty bucks?!"" I definately feel I've gotten my money's worth, and will buy another when baby #2 (due Dec. '07) gets big enough to need one."
74348,2,"The tightening mechanism is weak and leaves the seat loose. We are average weight people, 5' 10"", 180, being the largest person in the house, myself. I strongly discourage anybody from wasting their money on this product. Do not by plastic if you can help it. If I could return it, I would, but I tossed the box. Returning a toilet seat seems wrong since it is used. Ok, enough ranting, just trust me. P.S. I've never written one of these feedback boxes before. I am not paid to write this, obviously :-)"
13615,0,"We have been satisfied with this product. It was not the most expensive changing table, so we feel we have gotten good value out of it. We did have one problem in the beginning, the first one we brought home had two right sides so we had to take it back and get a new set that had both the left and right sides.The shelves are convenient for storing diapers , wipes and any other items you would like quick access to.Our baby is now 7 months old and we are still using it."
134299,1,"I bought this after using a borrowed one that was another brand. The other brand dried out the wipes terribly so that when I got to the bottom, the last ones were totally dry. So I wasted a lot of wipes. I had to return that one as my friend had another baby and needed it for herself. I bought this Ultimate Wipe Warmer after reading reviews, even the bad ones. I liked the fact that it fit in the diaper caddy that is on my changing table, whereas the other one had to sit at an angle.I also like that the cushion in the bottom keeps the wipes moist. I have not had one dry wipe, well except when my hubby forgets to put the lid down, but don't all guys have problems with that?I have learned that I can't put a whole package in, so I leave part of a package in a zip top bag. I also make sure I buy Pamper's One-Ups. It has to be the One-Ups or they will not pop up automatically.Overall, this is a wonderful product and I am so happy I bought it. I actually found it for 19.99 in a store.My baby's hinny thanks this product!"
4949,1,MY GRANDSON KEPT A REAL BAD CASE OF DIAPER RASH FROM BIRTH UNTIL WE FOUND THESE DIAPERS. HE COULD NOT WEAR ANY BRAND OF DIAPERS AND WAS AT THE DOCTORS OFFICE CONSTANTLY BECAUSE HIS RASH WOULD GET SO BAD. WE KEPT HIM CLEAN AND COULD NOT FIGURE IT OUT. AFTER SWITCHING TO THE SEVENTH GENERATION DIAPERS NO MORE DIAPER RASH!!!HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE!!!
105763,1,"I received the Diaper Champ as a gift at my baby shower 4 months ago after registering for it. I love it. I haven't noticed any smell, except when changing the bag, which is to be expected. It's very easy to use and like the other reviewers have said, it's much less expensive when you can just put in a normal garbage bag. I have no regrets about this, and have already bought it as a gift for another new mom. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it would be nice if it was bigger; I probably have to change the bag once a week. (But once again, that is probably because my breastfeeding baby has lots of poopy diapers!)"
37715,1,"We have been ordering these wipes for almost a year. After trying nearly every kind in the store, we saw this product on line and decided to give it a try. Now that our son is older, we use so many wipes, that it is silly and overwhelming if we don't buy them in bulk. Sometimes the web also offers coupons you can use online. These wipes are MUCH cheaper than the huggies, and of better quality. (Huggies- 4.8 cents ea. Luvs- 2.8 cents each)"
106389,1,"This has been our most-used item since the baby (now 10 months) got home from the hospital. It is VERY simple to use (much easier than the Genies I have tried at friends' houses), takes standard trash bag refills (which we buy in bulk) so is cheaper to use than the Genie, and keeps the bad smells in. We put a stick-on deodorizer in the bottom, so even when swapping out a full bag there is no odor."
42355,1,"I really love this wrap. When my son was born I originaly got a sling and enjoyed that but this is so much better. I wish I would have had it from birth. It is a little confusing at first but if you watch youtube videos and follow instruction in no time youll be a pro. I were mine all the time. If im bringing baby out I put it on before i leave the house so I dont have to drag it on the ground where we are going (its very long). Ive even gotten complements on how ""stylish"" it is lol. I really love the convenience and closeness. My son has GERD and it seems to help when I were him. The fabric is very soft breathable cotton. This is not a wrap to were baby/toddler on your back it will not work like that but there are many other carries for it."
142911,0,"I like the fact that it's pressure mounted, and it stays in place better then some gates, but we have once or twice tripped over the bar on the bottom and knocked it out of place. We also had an issue with an opening that was just 1 inch to small to use the extension with it, and it didn't stay very well. It's also a little bothersome to have to remember to step over the bar, when there are gates out there that do not have that. My older kids (7&8) sometimes have a difficult getting this to open/shut correctly as well, they need to use both hands to open it. But overall the gates does the job it's supposed to."
117801,1,MY SON LOVED THIS JUMPER. HE HAS SPENT HOURS IN IT. SOME OF OUR HAPPIEST MOMENTS OF VIDEO WHEN HE WAS JUST A FEW MONTHS OLD WERE IN THIS SEAT!! LOVED IT!! 3MO-11MO.
80459,1,"I love this product. The colors are definitely brighter than they appear online; however, it is still cute. It is big enough to fit the biggest shopping carts, and it works great on highchairs in restaurants as well. My 7 month old boy loves the lion toy because it makes noise. I also like the fact that I can add his own toys to the cover with links. I would definitely recommend this product!"
118315,1,"If you have used breast milk storage bags in the past, you will immediately fall in love with the Via containers. They are sturdy and withstand freezing and thawing. With bags, there is the problem of how to store them in the freezer to protect from abrasions,rips, cracks or holes which render your precious milk useless. Pumping takes time and energy. The Via system is not perfect, but you can pump directly into the storage containers, they stack well, and they provide a durable plastic shield. It is true that the the screw on lid design has its flaws, although I haven't had any leaking problems. I say start with a smaller package and then make you storage decision."
119804,0,I purchased the seat and started using it on a an almost 6 month old child while feeding infant cereal.Another model made by another company called the Bumbo baby seat was in the news this week (Oct.2007) that they are recalling their model because it caused severe head injuries to the infant. If the infant tried to reach for something it could tip over.I would suggest never putting this seat on a table top and never leave the baby unattended. I sit with the baby while he is playing with the attachable toy or eating with the cute tray covers attached. It works fine right now and is just the right size until he is ready for a high chair. I am happy with my purchase.
142227,0,"As far as front carriers go, this one with extra lumbar support is good. My son is now 4 months old and weighs just over 14 pounds and is getting too heavy for my to carry around in this. When he was younger it worked much better for us. In my opinion, all front carriers are going to pull on your shoulders...it is the nature of their design."
73826,1,"i would definitely recommend this product!! its a must-have for parents, especially first time parents like us. its so nice to have one place to look to see if she's due for a diaper change or feeding, instead of trying to remember to look at the clock every time. it works great and i haven't had any problems with it being fragile like other reviews mentioned."
128656,1,"I bought 2 of the these in case I have to wash one. I do wash then almost every 2weeks for over one year and they still look good. Love it, would recommend!"
91914,1,"This a splurge since it's kinda expensive- but it has been great!This was bigger than I expected, so I use it to organize my diaper bag (which is always chaotic). I store my changing pad and use the outside pocket for diaper wipes and the clean spare diaper. This is such a bonus!I originally bought it for cloth diapers. It works great for that purpose too. Besides, what prettier thing could you want to store your soileds in?"
13282,0,"We never could get my son's carseat in tight enough in the middle seat because the lapbelt lock was too high. We stumbled across this item and fell in love. I was scolded, however, when I took our carseat for inspection when we turned it front-facing. I was told that this has not been tested on all carseat models. If the MightyTight were to crack or break during a crash, the slack would release causing the seat to move freely. It can also fray the belt, making it possible to tear. The technician showed me how to make the lap belt work by twisting the clip/lock part of the seatbelt once and that shortened it just enough to not be in the way of tightening properly. Come December we won't have to mess with the center seat for then we will have an infant seat with our toddler. I am very thankful for the technician showing me the trick and being honest with me about the MightyTight. I never would have forgiven myself if we had wrecked and something happened to allow slack in the belt and injury to my son. I wish the previous technician were that well trained and so informative."
133703,0,"We were pleased to find this product on line as we were not able to find anything locally to secure our bookcases. The bands and brackets work exactly as we had hoped. However like many of the other customers noted the screws are inferior. We purchased this product regardless and tried using the supplied screws. The heads stripped right away. Do yourself a favor and buy screws from your hardware store before starting the project. You'll save yourself time and frustration. With all this said, once again, the product works as promised. The only reason for three stars is the screw problem."
73270,1,"This was definitely the best purchase I made as a new mom. When you can barely see straight from exhaustion, this product will help you remember everything you need to know. How long ago did baby eat last? When was the last diaper change? How long has he been sleeping? What side did I nurse from last? The Itzbeen will keep track of everything for you. Easy to use, and lots of cool features. The built-in flashlight comes in handy during middle-of-the-night feedings. There is also an alarm, which is useful as well. Worth every penny! Buy it now!"
112216,1,"Great diapers! I've used these diapers for both my kids and noticed how the diapers are thinner and look different inside than they used to. However, the quality appears unchanged. We have had no mishaps or leaks with the newest version."
16359,1,This product is as described.. Comfortable and portable. Received sooner then expected. I bought this as a gift for a friend.. And she was happy with it.
93030,1,"There definitely is a support seam that runs in the middle, making that part higher than the rest of the cot, but this seems to be a non-issue with my kids. My 4-year old and 2-year old both love their cots! I'm glad I bought 2 otherwise I'd they'd fight over it. Super portable, zero set-up time makes this cot perfect for sleep-overs, camping, day at the beach under the umbrella, extra bed at grandma's house, road trips...the possibilites abound. The best $20 spent!"
1586,1,"When our baby was born, we tried a wide variety of diapers. Since I received almost every brand at my baby-shower, we got to experiment!But we went back to Pampers after trying them all. We have a lanky baby and I have heard that makes a difference.Even after a long, wet night, the baby still smells like a baby and not like pee-diaper. And she doesn't leak 98% of the time between changings. The tabs are super stretchy and makes sure she fits in the diapers properly.My biggest suggestion is if your baby is between sizes, go up to the next size!I also love that I can buy them in such a big package and save money! Yey!!!"
110589,0,I like this product but like someone said the side pockets are too small to fit more than 2 diapers and a big box of wipes. Also i dont think it lasts too long. But then again what more you can ask for 9 bucks ??I had to buy another one in about 11 months of using one kit.
126688,1,My little granddaughter is dry and comfortable in these Huggies diapers. The idea of having the diapers delivered each month to the home has been very appealing and has been very dependable. It is a wonderful way to help young families when you don't live in the same town.
39735,1,"My son was a light sleeper who would wake up within minutes of us putting him in his crib. With this sound machine set on the ""womb"" setting, he sleeps for hours. Plus, it covers up the noise of my other son playing in the house. It was well worth the $20 to get some sleep!"
77858,1,"We bought this chair after our daughter was out of the smaller car seat and started to sit on her own. We use it every time we eat out (about 2x a week) and have no trouble w/ it. It is pretty easy to set up (I'm a little better at it than my husband is) and comes off just as easy once you know the right way to do it. We like to have her right at the table w/ us and not in one of the gross resturant high chairs which she can climb right out of. The only thing bad I will say about it is that the legs don't stay folded when not in use. There should be some kind of lock to keep the thing closed. Ours didn't come w/ a bag so maybe that would help. Otherwise, we love this chair!!"
13962,0,"When I had my first daughter, I insisted on the Avent bottles. I had worked in daycares and several babies had used these bottles. I liked the shape of the nipple and the easy to hold bottle. I had never had a problem with them before. Until she was 3 weeks old and we tried to give her one, that is! Even on the lowest flow, the milk was running down her chin and she couldn't get a good suction on the nipple. She constantly was making a clicking noise trying to latch on. The nipple is much too hard! I never had a leaking problem with these bottles as many had, it was simply the nipple that my daughter couldn't handle. Having spent a fortune on these bottles, getting the entire set before she was born (my mistake!), I kept on trying them with her. She is a spit-up champion, and her dr. recommended we add a little rice cereal to her bottles and we tried her on the 'variable flow' nipple. What a waste! She choked and gagged even on the slowest flow of a variable nipple. It claims to match the stage 2 flow, but it is much faster. In the end, we switched to Dr. Browns. We should have listened in the first place and gone with these; the nipple is much softer and she doesn't lose a drop down her chin."
113752,1,After exploring the internet for booster seats I decided on the Healthy Care by Fisher-Price. My 16 month old had decided that she didn't like her highchair any longer and I was skeptical that I was going to find ANY chair that she would like. Her grandma had bought the On the Go Fold Up and she wouldn't even sit in it. She seems to love being a &quot;big girl&quot; in her FP one. I love that it comes with a cover for the tray as we have two dogs and all highchair trays seem to attract dog hair (static). It really attaches snuggly to our chairs and is easy to clean. The only thing that I am disappointed in is the size of the tray-it is a bit small. Overall though I am very happy with this chair.
29069,1,I really this jogger. I'm a non driver so i do quite a bit of walking. It glides over any sidewalk with ease. I only have one issue. There not way to lock it close when not in use. I do quite a bit a flying so i was a little dissapointed about that. I suggest getting a bungee cord to wrap around for traveling.
127693,1,"We bought this for a recent vacation to Walt Disney World at it was excellent! It was small and light enough to bring along everywhere. Worked on all high chairs. Even if we couldn't use all the velcro due to the high chair design, there was enough velcro in other places to make it stay put. Plus it is very easy to wipe clean. The toy straps are also a nice feature. Excellent value too."
140983,1,"I'd been decorating my daughter's ""big girl room"" in bits and pieces, starting with a polka dot comforter that I loved. I had simple white valances up, but the room just wasn't coming together. When I spotted these online, they seemed perfect, but you never really know until you see them in person. Thankfully, they didn't disappoint! They are a nice weight, well made, and are full enough that I only needed one valance per window. Plus the colors really pull everything together. I would definitely order them again!"
89716,1,"I usually get generic, but calculated these at just pennies more. Tried them and am NEVER going back haha! Thin as a maxipad! I thought they'd never hold up, but they hold TONS more than generic and better than that...they wick away moisture better than any diaper I've ever used. LOVE these."
128896,0,"My wife and I had our first child in January of this year and have embarked on the journey of parenthood, as well as the new found journey of ""concerned about everything, what it's made of, how it works, what shape and size it is, what color is it, how does it smell, who made it, what's the country of origin"" and all of the other quirks that come with being a new parent.We got these playtex dropins as a hopeful alternative to ""le nip d'au naturale"" so that my wife and I could venture out and enjoy some time as a couple again.We ended up with an up and down response for our child, she enjoys chewing on them more than she enjoys sucking out of them, and after a bout a month completely lost interest in the bottle at all.All in all they are a great product, well made, and seem to be easier to latch onto than some other nipple styles, but they just weren't for our little one."
62366,1,"This sort of product wasn't available with my first child. It was such a pain to get him into winter outerwear, and even more a pain to take it off when we got to where we were going. When I found this Bundleme product, I knew it would be much easier to survive the winter months in Michigan with my second child. It fits easily into my Graco infant carseat/carrier. I don't have to worry about dressing him up, I just put a hat on him and off we go!! It's also easier to buckle the baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere- and probably safer too!! When we get to where ever we are going I just unzip the sides and he's fine. So far we have endured 40 degree temps, rain, wind and snow and he's stayed warm and snug as a bug the whole time!! Truly an excellent purchase!!"
9477,1,"LOVE this potty - it's so easy and comfortable for our son to sit on. Picked this one up after starting out with a Fisher Price potty that didn't have a splash guard (stupid me!), which was frustrating for everyone involved (trying to tell/help a 2-year old to ""point it down""... yeah, right) - as soon as our son tried this one out for the first time, his motivation level skyrocketed and he quickly became excited about peeing in the potty, instead of dreading it. The design and height are perfect, and the seat is easy to remove and empty (so much better than the ones where you have to slide the potty part out to empty it). Best potty ever!"
24541,1,"It's a great gate. We installed it in about 10 minutes, it looks great - it's subtle and blends in, and it's easy to use while carrying other things or when your hands aren't free. Our baby loves to hang out on it practicing standing as well."
173817,0,"This swing has some good features. I like the color. It's neutral, so it fits into our living room decor without looking tacky. But the swing is noisy and does not have a slow speed. Even on the slowest speed, it swings the baby very fast (newborn.) That may be fine, but I'd like to at least have the option of a slow speed. It's too noisy to use at night while I'm trying to sleep.The revolving toys that go around like a mobile above the baby's head are also neutral color, and don't really catch a baby's eye. I will add some colored toys to it eventually. The music and noises are ok, but not that soothing. It would be nice to have a night light on it."
46032,1,"My 2 month old baby absolutely adores this mobile. Whenever we put her under it (it's attached to her crib, but she still sleeps in a cradle), she stares up at it with great interest. Even better, it often elicits smiles and laughs!Many reviewers are disappointed that the mobile doesn't move, but, personally, I don't think that's a problem. Sometimes I move the mobile for her, but it doesn't seem necessary. She's perfectly content when it's stationary.Here are some of the downsides:1) It didn't come with all of the pictures shown :/ We got two sets of the same pictures. I'm not sure if this was a mistake or if this is what everyone gets.2) Switching out the pictures is not easy--the holes are small and the cards are not flexible.3) The mounting arm, a huge chunk of plastic, is rather unattractive. It was, initially, kinda painful to install this in my daughter's otherwise adorable (and nearly plastic free) nursery. But. . . she does love it, so I'm over it.It's not a perfect mobile, but I'd still highly recommend it."
19809,0,"This article was very hard to put together. I didnt mind that I had to put the whole thing together. First off, not all the holes were predrilled like the pictures showed. Some of the drawer pieces were assembled wrong. Then, the srews that came with it were very poor quality. I had 2 of them brake off using a screwdriver. I really didnt apply much force. The back of it is very cheaply made. After spending so much money you would think an actual wood piece would make up the back. No such luck. The wood came a little more yellow stained then the picture shows. After I put it together I didnt feel like sending it back because the whole thing just took to much work to put together. Next time I will buy something put together. That way the whole quality is great not just the front. Plus, I want someone I can fuss at right away when there product arrives at my house wrong."
87264,1,"That is why I love this system. It is true that you can't mix 8 oz in the bottle, but you can do it in a mesuring cup and then pour it in, or pre mix the formula and save it in the fridge. If you are on the go, then I guess you can buy some other bottle that acomodates you. That is what I do at least. (the pooh ones at [local] stores are great)I've tried them all and this is what I got:Avent: it is very good, but for some odd reason it started leaking after some time. Changed the nipples and it still leaks some times.Evenflo ultra (or whatever it is called): love the bottleshape and the nipple shape... hate the cap. IT COMES OF! constantly. I've lost them all. Also they leak.Gerber (the fat ones): the fist time I used it worked great, I was so happy. THe second time I used this bottle the nipple collapsed!playtex ventair: They leak like heck! I HATE THEM SO MUCH I WON'T EVEN TALK ABUT THEM (still have 3 unopened ones I got as a shower gift)disney babies: I have two pooh bottles that I love. They are my going out bottles, No leaks, collapses and they make 8 oz and beyond. The bad thing is that they don't sell the nipple replacement for these bottles. THe packaging even says ""can be used with avent nipples"" And I tried it with an Avent nipple... and it collapsed!plytex premium nurser: I love it because my baby loves it. I breast fed my baby for 6 months and then I stoped. I had to start giving her formula at 1 month because I didn't have enough milk for her, So I started trying different bottles then. Well about a month or two ago I bought one of these playtex premium bottles, because I needed bigger bottles. My baby LOVED IT. I'm convinced it feels like mommy to her, because she gets that nursing face of joy. It is a little cumbersome to heat water first and then mix the milk but it takes me about 10 seconds more to prepare the bottle, and honestly, she deserves those 10 extra seconds.The bottle doesn't leak, and the milk warms or cools down really quick when sumerged in cool or hot water.So this is what I can say about bottles so far. I forgot to mention that you can interexchange nipples between playtex premium, evenflo ultra and the fat gerber ones, but I didn't have a good experience with this. They either collapsed or leaked.Thank you for readingMacarena"
176167,1,Love it! Has protected our son's klean kanteen from being damaged several times when he's dropped it!
148517,1,"Wife loves it.Excellent product for back and belly support, a softer pillow would have been better.The pillow part has the same filling as the rest of the product.For those users who prefer a soft pillow, this product may pose some difficulties. For all others, please go an get one.Excellent value for the same money as the other one-sided pillows."
3915,0,"It is nice, light-weight, and durable, but you can't put a drink from a restaurant in it. It's way to flimsy for that. That's why you only see bottles in the pictures. Other than that, no complaints."
113468,0,Good product but it is small. I think my grand son will outgrow it soon and he just turned one.
93933,1,"If you want a glass of wine without the guilt this is the way to go. My pediatrician said that 0-3 month old livers are not equipped to process alcohol so I, for one, want to know if I'm passing along any alcohol whatsoever. Milkscreen certainly helped me to do that so I would highly recommend it to other moms like me."
164267,1,MY NEPHEW USE THAT ITEM I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD ITEM I LIKE .SO I BOUGHT 4 FOR MY SON
147720,1,"I did a lot of research on infant seats, and decided on the Primo Viaggio (based on Consumer Reports and Baby Bargains reviews). It's been a great seat, but it's time to move on to the larger Britax since our son is 17 lbs. and nearly 26 inches already at 5-months-old (he weighed 8 lbs. and was 21 inches long at birth). His shoulders are too broad for the seat now, as well. Even though we didn't get a lot of wear out of this seat, I'd still recommend it because it's rated as the safest rear-facing infant seat on the market. It's very hard to pick out a seat before your child is even born since you have no idea what size they're going to be. Good luck!"
125452,0,"Overall for the price this is a cute teehter. Baby likes it sometimes, sometimes not. It is harder than I expected, and a bit hard to wash. Otherwise, it is cute and functions like it should."
103741,2,These are marked Medela but come in an unmarked plastic baggie. These don't come in the Medela box that they should come in. Might be a way for the seller to save money on shipping. But also could indicate a used product. Sketchy to me.
70931,1,"I just love this infant to toddler rocker!!! I used it with my 3yr old who still sits in it to watch TV!! Now I started using it with my baby since he was born and now is 2 months old, he just loves it.. The bottom of the rocker turns into a bed which is so convenient when you need to put baby down to sleep, you just pull the bar out and it turns into a little bed. Not sure how the last comment about the child landed on it's head happened, but we have never had a problem with it since I used with my 3yr old and now my 2 month old. I felt more then secure with this product. I even bring it with me to my kitchen so I can see baby and he can see me while I cook. The colors on this rocker are very colorful which babies love and the toys are interesting enough. I just wish the song would play a little longer too. The vibrating is great to massage babies back which my little baby likes. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a newborn, infant, or toddler."
49550,0,"I have one of these for my sock drawer. It works fine for men's dress socks, hankerchiefs, and ties(rolled). My wife uses them for ladies undies, nylons, and scarves. However, it is too flimsy for my cotton boot and tennis shoe socks."
181205,1,"This mat was wonderful and we just stopped using it at 13 months, the attached toys are still in use, however. Out of the box this wonderful and whimsical play mat even caught my attention. The giraffe helps hide the batteries and is part of the rainbow supports and also holds a mirror in its mouth. The green leaves are soft and hide a four color light circle that with either classical music or rainforest sounds change colors and pattern with the music. The toys were great for my daughter as she got older say 5 months and up. The parrot has a fun spinner perch, the monkey rattles, the toucan is soft with crinkles wings, the soft monkey has been put on the stroller because she loves its large soft hands and ears.Pros: Great for older babies. Gets and maintains baby&#8217;s attentions. Fun colors and lots of options for play and motor/visual learning and growth. As our daughter grew, the supports were strong enough to use to stand and bounce a little. Fischer Price really did a nice job choosing materials that easily clean. For those &#8220;Oh no&#8221; mornings, she would lay under the leaves and watch the lights change and roll to play on her own.Cons: Would have loved if the rainbows collapsed and could be easily removed for travel and/or storage. Takes a lot of C batteries BUT we have not had to replace them even after 13 months of solid use. Can only hang toys on designated soft hooks. Monkey did not come with hanging ring, I had to fabricate one. Overall though a great item and a godsend on most days!Would recommend!"
109964,0,"This cart was easy to assemble, shipped quickly and will serve it's purpose. I got it to keep baby's bath stuff, diapers, and receiving blankets in. It's a little wobbly, not real sturdy. So even though it has wheels I would recommend you leave it in one place. The pockets are all cloth and it comes with a few cardboard liners to put in the cubbies where you will have the heavier things. But, there are not enough inserts for all the pockets.It wasn't too hard to assemble. I'm 8 months pregnant and put it together on my own in about 1/2 hour. As I said, a little wobbly but if you put it in one place and leave it it works just fine."
90946,2,3 out of 7 mornings my son wakes up WET! I have had better luck with off-brand diapers! Very disappointed! :(will NOT buy again!!
166674,0,Swaddlers are way better than baby dry. I won't be ordering these again. They just don't absorb # 2's like Swaddlers and there isn't a netting like Swaddlers that keeps the baby's skin dry.
34145,1,"I loved this bag for our Roundabouts, and was worried that our Frontiers would not fit, but YAY! The Britax Frontier fits in this bag. I wish the product description would the Frontier in their list of Britax seats. Would save us a lot of will-it, won't-it fit worry.Very useful bag to have when traveling. Can stash some jackets, diapers etc in there, too."
170514,1,My baby loves this seat! It is more expensive than some of the other carseats out there. But it's an important purchace. Will buy Britax again in the future when I have more babies.
176043,1,This is a gorgoeus album! It's beautiful and comes packaged securely. Make sure to take out of packaging before giving as a gift because it does smell strange right out of the plastic. Overall it's a great buy for the money.....
41284,2,"I bought my diapers here for months and months! I can't believe you've raised prices this high!! Absolutely ridiculous!! I'll go back to Walmart where I can use coupons! Thanks, anyway!"
118624,0,"If you must have a ""kit,"" I would suggest buying a smaller, cheaper version. The Safety1st Hospital's Choice kit is only $9.99 and includes the basics...thermometer, nasal aspirator... but in addition it includes a baby nail clipper (the EFB version doesn't). It has a nice small carrying case for a diaper bag. However, I think it would be a better investment overall to buy a high-quality thermometer, because it is something you will need for a long time, and buy the other things you may need separately."
178869,2,"This carrier puts all the baby's weight on your shoulders and upper back. I can stand it until the baby's about 10 pounds, but after that, it's just plain painful.The pain starts in my shoulders, where the straps start to dig in. Then it moves to my lower back, which is straining to stay straight with 10+ pounds of baby pulling my upper back forward. Then my stomach muscles start to ache too.The only time i ever use this carrier is at the grocery story, where the fact that it is pretty easy to get set up solo is a major benefit. For walks at home when i can take the time to get the it set up, or any time i can borrow another pair of hands, i use theERGOcarrier, which keeps the weight on my hips instead of contorting my spine."
33100,1,"These shells work great.The first few weeks of breast-feeding my baby were painful and I did not want anything touching my breasts, so these shells worked great as a barrier between my clothes and my skin.I used to leak a lot and these shells helped collect the leaked milk without staining my clothes."
110564,1,"This product is the perfect size if you're not going to be out all day long. It fits 2-3 diapers in size 2 (up to 4 in newborn size) in one inside pocket and has a wipes case for the other.The wipes case is great, I would say it holds about 20-25 wipes, and it's of better quality than the name-brand travel case I was using in my bigger bag. It's a good thing they include the wipes case too, because other travel wipes cases I have seen or used would not fit in the mesh pocket of this product.The outside pocket is convenient for a limited number of small items (for me it's usually phone, keys, chap stick, money/ID) but doesn't fit much more than that. It has a strap with velcro so it can be attached to any number of items (stroller, etc.) which is also nice. The changing pad wipes off quickly and easily, and is a good shape and size.This kit is so convenient to use when you just need the necessities. I love it, and use it all the time when I don't want to lug around the whole diaper bag. An added bonus is that women who carry large purses (which may be more fashionable than some diaper bags) can just drop this in their purse as well. Also, of all the kits I have seen out there, this one is the best when considering price. The only one I've seen that I like better is 3x as expensive.The only thing I would change about this kit is to have a little more space in the outside pocket, which isn't a really big deal. I mean, in order to do that, the whole product would be bigger in size, and the small size is one of the things I love about it."
27719,1,I gave this stroller a 4 because there is no parent consol. Other than that it handles very well.
32725,0,"I liked the concept behind this carrier, but I just couldn't handly the weight of my 12 pound baby on my stomach. My back started hurting after 15 minutes of walking around with him strapped on to me at the mall. It's okay to use for short period of time, but I definitely would rather use a stroller for longer walks at the mall or park."
125462,0,"This teether is as good as any. No one has created one that children really like. Made well, just not for ours."
9936,0,I was looking for something I could take with me to use in public restrooms or at other people's homes since my son is afraid of big toilets. I ended up returning this and getting the Fisher Price Travel Potty that comes with a case for around $17.00 from Wal-Mart. It works much better than this toilet trainer.
149602,0,"OK speed delivery wise, but the box was thrashed but its only a mattress, figured out it was to small for what we needed it for but that's OK because there are 4 kids in the how and it fit in the babys crib real nicely."
43382,0,"We live in the city and I thought this would be easier than purchasing a separate stroller, but the wheels on this stroller are plastic and not very shock absorbent. We had to go very slow so that the baby didn't jostle around so much as he's only 10 days old. Wish we would have researched if there was something more shock absorbent for infants.I wanted to update my review, my baby is now 6 weeks old. Be careful of the brakes while walking. The brakes are not up very high and while crossing the street, my foot hit the brake and the stroller stopped in the middle of the street. I had the right of way, just wanted to update with the sensitivity of the brakes."
178612,1,I just received my Baby Bjorn in the mail and took exactly 5 minutes to figure it out. This is by far one of the best baby carriers out there. I had bought the Infantino over the weekend and was so ovewhelmed with all the security locks involved. I would recommend this product over any other carriers in the market place. My baby loved it as soon as she was carried in it.
65300,1,"a must have, if you are going to spend the big $ for the bob, then get this, it makes it much more comfortable to use, quality made, no problems"
150620,2,"We purchased this stroller based on the Consumer Reports rating of the product, and, in spite of some of the other negative reviews on this web site. Unfortunately, we should have listened to the other negative reviews. As noted by other reviewers, the front wheel of this stroller veers hard to the left. We attempted to fix it as directed but no matter what we do it still steers dramatically to the left.Beyond that, the stroller arrived to us in a substandard form. Specifically, the box it was shipped in had old shipping labels on it clearly indicating it had been returned by a previous customer. When we opened the package, that assumption was confirmed as it was clear the stroller had been virtually shoved back into the original box. As a result of the treatment, the stroller actually arrived to us damaged. There were significant scratches on it and even dings/dents in the rubber handles etc. We would have returned this item but we didn't want to waste the money on shipping, and, we had discarded the outer box before we realized what a mess the stroller was.We highly recommend against this stroller."
113359,1,This is a very clear non static monitor. I had so much touble with my last monitor I had to send it back to the manufacturer. One day after I bought this monitor I acidentally dropped it in to a bucket of dirty water. I was so upset because I just loved it. After I set it out to dry for a couple of hours it was as good as new. I have searched and researched monitors and this is the best for the money.
173066,1,"This product is great at protecting your seat from car seat marks or kid kicks. However, if you are in the business of switching car seats from car to car, it's really annoying to install the car seat while trying to keep the top part of the seat saver to stay up right at the same time. It keeps folding down as soon as you let it go. The installation of the car seat becomes even more difficult when you have leather seats. The seat saver slides very easily out of position as you're trying to position the car seat right. A lot of back and forth.But if you will only install it once in a while, this is a fine product. You'll thank yourself when you sell your car in next to new interior condition."
93892,0,I like the quality of the gate but I ended up needing to buy two extensions to fit my entry way because it only extends the gate 9 inches.
35273,0,"The shade matches the bedding very well. My single-mom daughter ordered it, wanting her baby's nursery to be perfect. It looks great and she's very pleased with how it looks on the $8 lamp base we found at WalMart. However, the shipping cost was ridiculous - the seller doesn't make it clear at all as to how the shipping is computed. The final cost of the shade with shipping was almost $40 - way too much!!! Will not buy from this seller again!!"
79871,0,"I originally bought this Toilet Roll Guard because I was sick of my cat un-rolling entire rolls of toilet paper to play with! It definitely served its purpose because my cat stopped playing with the toilet paper and even months after removing the guard he has still never tried to un-spool the paper again! However, this product is a pain in the butt for the humans using it. You have to use two hands to get the paper out, one to tug paper and one to hold down the lever. Sometimes it gets caught and you have to struggle with the contraption to get any paper out at all! And changing an empty roll is even more of a headache. It is difficult trying to take it off, once you get your new roll on it is a pain getting it back on! I gave up after a few weeks of my boyfriend complaining constantly about it, and fortunately by this time my cat stopped bothering with it too! So like I said, it served its purpose.. now it has been donated to the Good Will!"
148801,1,"I love this pillow! I love being able to roll over without hitting my husband in the face while he's sleeping with the ""snoogle"" With this pillow, there's no need to re-adjust, just turn over. it's great. I can even lay on my back and sleep because I can prop the pillow under my right side and still be really comfy. Also, I found it cheaper on another website w/free shipping so shop around before ordering."
94698,1,"Good quality pins, as described. We plan to use them for backpacking. There are always a few things - wet socks, whatever - to attach to the outside of my backpack."
127609,0,"This was easy to assemble, but once done, it's a little flimsier than most. A selling point of this bassinet is that it's portable but once you scoot it from one room to another more than a few times, the legs get a little wobbly.Also, the ""pin"" that is supposed to keep the cradle in place falls out too easily, and catches against the wood, which of course scratches it.Another time, the pin goes in, but the pin is so thin that the cradle moves about. So if baby rolls to the side, he will be on a slight incline, which may wake him up because the pin comes out so easily and is the wrong girth. Also, my son got his foot stuck through the slats."
81311,1,"every new parent must have it . really useful since it has the brush, nail clipper, thermometer . check with the hospital if they suggest an alternative if you don't want to buy the whole stuff."
21710,1,"We bought this for our son's nursery. Actually, my husband picked it out. The colors are bright and beautiful, and the patchwork animals are adorable. I am purchasing some of the other accessories soon and can't wait to see the finished room. My only complaint is that the bumper drew up some when I washed it and line dried it. The two ends don't quite meet together. OVerall, you will not be disappointed with this set."
83013,2,"I own and love the Revolution stroller. However, I bought an insert at TJ Maxx the other week for $7.00. It looks practically the same with the soft sherpa material and reversible. It may not line the ENTIRE seat but it does the job. It covers him where he sits and it's also longer for the legs as it drops down just a little in front. So, I'd have to say that this item must be overpriced for it's function. You can find something cheaper. Save your money. Look elsewhere."
151019,1,"I purchased the Aspen Stages Crib (Cherry) also. So I purchased this changing table and the Beatrice Armoire to match. When I received it I was VERY pleased. It had a minor scuff on the front of the left arm, but it wasn't a big enough deal to me to send back for another one. It is absolutely beautiful and matches my crib wonderfully. The drawer is great. I love that I can hold things in it without them being visible on the shelves. The pad seems to be comfortable and the strap is easily removable for those that don't want it. On the other hand, it screws in underneath the top panel so it won't come off on its own. Overall, the changing table is very sturdy. Well worth the money. (...)"
88553,2,"I PURCHASED THESE 5 DAYS AGO AND HAD FREE ""2-DAY SHIPPING"" AND HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. WE HAVE TWO BABIES AT HOME THAT ARE BOTH IN DIAPERS SO I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE CONVENIENT AND I PURCHASED THESE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIVE CLOSE TO A CITY SO I WAS TRYING TO SAVE US A TRIP... WHAT A MISTAKE!!!! VERY DISATISFIED WITH AMAZON!!"
17943,0,"my daughter used this seat itwas great for her,but i cant imagine my son using it without peeing all over"
163756,0,"We bought this for our 6 month old daughter about a year and a half ago. I thought it would be great to be able to take it with us places, but then quickly realized it was much bulkier than I was expecting. It has great support for younger children though and I really liked that you could adjust the angle for the comfort of a younger baby. Unfortunately, now that our daughter is almost two we are in need of a booster seat that will allow her to pull up to the table with us. I had thought this one would serve that purpose but it turns out that the arm rests hit our table (even with the height at the lowest setting) so that she can't get close enough to eat with us. I think we'll shoot for a smaller one that will travel better next time. This just didn't end up working as well as I'd hoped."
138552,1,"I bought the Cloud b Twilight Turtle for my little brother. It was a huge hit! He loved it and instantly had to turn it on in a dark room. Even the adults wanted one! If would highly recommend this item to anyone who has young kids, or just wants your room to look cool at night!"
35364,0,"Before going on a cruise, I had bought my son a Maclaren umbrella for his stroller. Because he can't help but play with it, he ended up breaking it. I thought I'd give this a try since I wouldn't have to adjust it and he wouldn't be able to move it. Well, I was disappointed. It fits great on my Triumph but it's very floppy. The kid can't see anything in front of him. I thought it'd stay arched like in the picture but it doesn't. Moreover, his legs are fully exposed. The shade gives him no shade at all. It does provide more than the original canopy coming with the stroller but nothing compares to the real umbrella. I will try to re-fit it again but I will probably order another Maclaren umbrella anyway. All in all, not recommended for the Triumph."
91839,1,"Use it to cover her stroller for walks. We were able to take her down the handicapped path in the woods without 1 bug bite.Used it to cover play yard in the back yard.Used it to keep cats out of the play yard before she came home from the hospital... Didn't work well here, as it isn't designed to support a 12 lb cat... but... he hated the feel of it... so he didn't stay put once he got there."
169366,1,I like this product but you have to move around the compartments to really get all of your premeasured formula into the bottle. I wish it were easier to get it out. I use this product to cut down the hassle of night time feedings.
136883,1,The skirt is exactly as described. It looks great on the crib. The transaction went very well. I'd recommend this seller.
40127,1,"I was using huggies since my son was born, but he is in between their sizes so I bought a pack of Pampers Swaddlers just to give them a try and I LOVE THEM! They fit perfectly, are soft and stretchy, and very absorbent. I will be sticking to Pampers until my son is potty trained!"
1027,1,"I have always loved pampers because they are so soft and thin that they seem more comfortable on my baby than any other brand. I have an 18 month old in a size 3, and so far she has had no rashes or night leakage in these. I have used pampers for all 3 of my kids, and now that we are expecting twins I have already stocked up on more pampers swaddlers for a month! Thanks amazon for the amazing prices on diapers!"
138311,1,"I love this turtle. We got it for our son, who loves everything about it (stars, moon, and turtles-- what isn't there for a boy to love? it would be even cooler with a spaceship, but that might anger purists). The amazon price is the best we've seen, even with all the Christmas sales going on right now.Many people complain about either the single color of stars at a time or the low level of brightness with the amber stars... here is my alternative take on it:The availability of one hue at a time and the difference in brightness between the hues allows us to vary the brightness we want the ""nightlight"" to be. Some nights our son needs a little more encouragement to sleep-- that's when we use the less bright amber colored stars. It provides just about enough light for comfort and the stars are faintly lit on the wall, but ut's dark enough to really encourage sleep.I love is simplicity-- less room for failure or breakage. It's a perfect kids' presen in my book. :)"
172272,1,I love this seat and so does my daughter. The seat allows you to have more freedom while bathing a baby. Although My baby is able to sit on her own the bath tub is still quite slippery so it's nice to have that extra security. The seat goes on and off the tub very easily. Easy to keep clean also.
49349,0,"If it is your intention to leave this up for an extended period, then this product will meet your expectations. However, if you will be putting it up and taking it down a lot, I have found it to be inconvenient. It does not open and close without some effort. Other than that, it serves its purpose."
100459,0,"Two kids and never had a leak with these, aside from the occasional up the back blowout that I don't think any diaper could have controlled...but Pampers seem to feel sort of damp/wet when they get full, which I've never experienced with other brands. Not using these at night for our kids because we think they seem to wake up at night more often in these...perhaps because of this feeling of wetness? Like the price, wish it didn't have the wet feeling."
25611,0,"Nice cup until it gets moldy way deep inside the spout....won't come off. Nice that it's BPA free, but the mold isn't something I want my child to drink, Can't find any replacement parts....not worth the money if you have to rebuy every few month."
123387,1,"This is the second Graco tot bloc that we have owned. The only reason I need another was that we gifted our ""old"" one which was the primary bug themed one and got the solid black one. They are well made and sturdy. The newer version has side buttons which allow the side rails to go up easily. I like that the playpen dosent scream ""baby"" all over it and we purchased sheets here on amazon for it that added a personal touch to them. The square playpens are so much more practical than the rectangular ones. They offer up a lot of safe secured space for baby/toddler. I have used them up to 2 yrs old due to the high weight limit and wall height on these. But is does take up more room than the tradional rectangular ones. My kids loved having lots of space to play in so this worked out well for us. My only complaint is the carrying bag which is made out of thin nylon material. I wish it was a little more sturdier as it reckons if your using it your traveling around with it."
62381,0,I love the way that the bundle me works but I had a huge problem the other day because the pull came off of the zipper at the top of the bundle me... could be a serious choking problem.
24103,1,This item was exactly what I was looking for. It has provided much more comfort then the other breast shields that I had. Thank you!
86557,1,"With my older son, I had a wipe warmer that was an old-style reach-in warmer that made wipes yellow and crispy on the bottom, but served its purpose. I sold it at a yard sale after I was done with it.For my new baby girl, I didn't think I wanted to bother with getting one. Afterall, some parents say it is a waste of money, and frivilous. Well, after a few weeks of terrifying screams from my babygirl when that cold wipe touched her hind, I decided it was a luxury that I wanted for her. I researched and looked at many different kinds on the market. This one is more pricey, but it seemed to me to be the best one out there. So I ordered it sight unseen. I am SO GLAD I DID. It heats from the top down, so the warmest wipes are the ones dispensed first. If you keep the warmer a long arms reach away, then the wipe will cool down by the time you get it to the baby. Keep it close by. They are not 'hot wipes', but definetely soothingly warmer than cool air temperature ones. It does help to add water if the wipes start to seem a little dry to the touch.I have usually used Pampers Sensitive pop ups wipes. In this warmer, I found they stuck together, coming out in strings of 2,3,4...and I had to use both hands to seperate them. I switched to try the Wal-mart brand of Parents Choice Newborn Soft, and they work MUCH better, and seperate from each other upon dispensing. The night-light is very nice. You activate it with the push of a button, and can re-push the button to turn it off, or it turns itself off in 10 mins. The window on the front to see when you are running out of wipes is a good idea, but is usually misty/foggy so you can't see them anyway.Overall this is an AWESOME warmer. This one is SO easy to use and refill. If you are a parent who prefers the added luxury of a warm wipe for your little babe, then THIS IS THE ONE! So worth the money!!"
48736,1,The product showed up on time and in great condition! I'm very please with how easy it works to block off sections of the house from the dogs. Its also very easy to remove or add sections as needed.
127383,1,"After reading several reviews about Davinci cribs both here and from Consumer reports we decided to go with this crib (we liked it better than the Emily). I was a little concerned about getting it together after all the feedback that it was difficult to follow directions. With me (8+ months pregnant) sitting on the floor and my husband putting the parts together - it took us about an hour. If you've ever dealt with Ikea instructions, these are a piece of cake. The crib is sturdy and beautiful and I can't wait to put our baby in it.I can tell that the wood will probably scratch easily - but with some bumpers and rail protection, I think it will be just fine!"
158203,2,"This sling isn't good for the baby. It's way too big, and the baby ends up smooshed inside. Perhaps for a very big person with really wide shoulders it would work, but I am average, and felt my baby couldn't breathe properly crushed in this sling. There are better brands out there."
151737,0,"I have been using this at least once a day (sometimes twice when I remember) on my breasts, hips and stomach. I don't like the smell. At all. Neither does my husband. It has sort of a stale citrus smell to it. The other problem with it is that it doesn't spread that well, so you wind up having to use a lot of it. I have to use one pump per breast and probably 4 more on my stomach/sides/hips each time, so it goes fast. It is greasy, but it's oil, so that's to be expected.I like that it's all safe for the baby and so far I'm stretch mark free, but I will update this when I'm further along and let you know how it goes.UPDATE: I'm now 38 weeks pregnant and, knock on wood, (haha) still no stretch marks! There looks like one MIGHT be developing on my hip, but there are absolutely none on my stomach, breasts, or thighs.Please keep in mind I use a TON of this stuff. I have gone through 5 bottles so far this pregnancy. Just ordered another bottle! I started using it right at the beginning, though, and I use it twice a day. It takes a lot of the oil to cover me as I've gained going on 40 pounds and it doesn't really spread out. I still don't like the smell (it smells like stale oranges, like I said before) but I haven't been itchy a single time this whole pregnancy and so far it has prevented stretch marks (and I have gained a lot of weight - 40 pounds, approx).Some people get stretchmarks AFTER pregnancy when their skin tries to go back down so I'm going to keep using it for a couple of months after I have her. So far, so good! If I make it to the end with no stretchmarks, I'm changing this to 5 stars! Hard to say since some people get them right at the end or after they have the baby but I'm impressed so far."
18636,1,"I bought this jogger after reading all of the reviews. I was a little optimistic at first, but as usual with little tikes, everything turned out to be okay!! My kids love riding in it, and i love using it. I jog on a flat surface, so there are no bumps, but i assume if the surface is not smooth, the ride for the kids will not be smooth as well. I would not blame it on the wheels of the jogger. To me, they seem very durable and long lasting."
81372,1,The LiteRider Stroller is a perfect light stroller for on the go. Our little one is 8 month now and he loves it. the lying position is deep enough for him to take a nap and the sitting one to see everything. The tray on the handle is great to put some little things down while shopping and i love the cup holders! It is easy to fold up and it is very light and easy to put in the car and out.For the price just a perfect stroller!
32170,1,They fit everything I need them to in my nursery- and look adorable on my changing table!
142660,1,"I ordered My Brest Friend 1 week before my son was born, even after receiving the Boppy as a gift. I had read so many wonderful reviews about the My Brest Friend that I knew I needed anything that would make my breastfeeding experience easier. The fact that the pillow is attached made it easier to get up during a feeding if necessary and answer the phone. There was also no worry of baby sinking between you and the pillow during a feeding. After 16 months of use I would say I got my monies worth! Though you do learn to use other things as they get older, I always preferred to use this. My son would even get excited when he would hear the ""click"" of the belt when I put it on! When I weaned we literally had to hide the pillow!"
123630,1,"I am a mom of three kids and this is by far the best Pack-n-Play on the market. When #3 came along we needed to purchase a new Pack-n-Play. The Graco Pack N Play with bug toys is absolutely the best we've ever owned. The bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old. She has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months, but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings. She actually gets excited about playing in her Pack N Play... and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption!And, best of all, it is so much bigger than the other Pack N Plays. There is plenty of room for her to play without rolling over the top of her toys. The set up and take down is super easy... all four sides break-down very easily and it folds nicely without any hassle. I am also a fan of the much thicker play mat that fits into the floor of the Pack N Play. I never worried about her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning to sit up.Overall, I can't say enough WONDERFUL things about this product! I'd put it on the new parent's ""must have"" list for sure."
13423,1,"I agree with all of the other positive reviews! I can't think of a single negative thing about this stool! We have an antique rocker that was passed down and this makes rocking, feeding, and just holding baby so much easier - especially since I am short and can't reach the floor easily when rocking!"
97845,1,"I love these bottles. I have never had a problem with any parts or the nipples. I started off with the Playtex bottles with drop-ins since I pump and store breastmilk, then decided to try these since my three-month-old has acid reflux. He does great with them, polishes off a bottle in 10 minutes whereas the disposables take him a lot longer to finish. I've never had a problem with him not getting milk out or having the ventaire suction part get stuck."
95000,1,"This pump is awesome. I have used a PIS and this pumps as well if not better than the PIS Original. I bought it because I never used the double pump feature and I really liked the idea I could use my own bag, use batteries in the pump, and generally have a tiny, light pump. I am thrilled on all three. My only compliant about this pump is the power plug...it ROCKETS out of the pump with the slightest twitch. I called Medela and they insist this is a safety feature. I think it is a design flaw, personally, but it can easily be resolved with a tiny piece of tape or a steady hand. I am so happy with the pump otherwise that I'm willing to overlook this. It is POUNDS lighter than the PIS as well, which is very nice. I have it in a purse with lots of pockets and it is actually lighter than my reg purse even with all of my milk bottles, milk bags, nipples, caps, and breastshields loaded in!"
82082,1,We baught this bed for our 15mo daughter she loves it and so do we!!This bed is great she can not roll out of it at night when she is sleeping...She can get in and out of it easy..Beleive it or not this is the first time in 5 months that she has slept in her room by herself!!I would recomend any parent to buy this bed for their little princess...I was very easy to put together took maybe 20 min and only one person!!Wonderful bed!!
66456,1,"What else I can say?....Really beautiful, so comfortable and a really nice price. Absolutely recommend it."
4047,1,Works great. Had to tie the straps to the poles cause the plastic clips broke. Works great. Still using it now
168345,1,"We initially saw few leaks sometimes and didn't get 100% satisfied. And also the diapers we used from a particular package also had fault in them, we used to see transperant crystal like jellies falling all over the baby (leaked from inside the diaper). It scared us first and it took a while for us to figure it they are from diaper. But we didn't see that problem afterwards (probably it's a manufacturing defect on that one package of diapers). Then we tried switching to Huggies and other brands, they all leaked all the time and they are not thick enough to handle more than one peeing. so we are back to pampers again and now we feel it is the best diaper for the baby."
150608,1,"I like to jog about 3 miles 2-3 times a week, and this jogger has been perfect for that. The seat was comfortable for my son from the get-go and is still comfortable (he was about 8 months old when I started using it and is 13 months now). It's easy to maneuver once you get going, and although the alignment isn't always perfect, it's easy to adjust. The adjustable handle is great, and the sunshade is huge and offers lots of protection from both sunshine and rain. It's a little bit bulky for storing, but I just fold mine down and lock it up like a bike outside, with a tarp to protect the fabric seat from rain. I'd definitely buy this again and will recommend it to friends."
109741,1,I am very pleased with this product! It was very easy to install and looks fantastic on my son's wall!
90647,1,"I used pampers swaddlers for my newborn and loved it. Later, I switched to pampers dry max size 2 which seemed to work fine for my baby. However, I am not a big fan of pampers baby dry size 3 for my 4.5 month old baby. The runny poop leaks from the back sometimes although the diaper has been able to sustain pee wetness overnight. Sadly, I will be trying other brands for the next size."
10952,1,"I found that this sheet fits well, even after several washes. It is smooth and does not irritate my babies very sensitive skin. I would recommend this product."
36150,1,"I got this for my grandson because the arms are just not what they used to be. I can carry him for quite a while and I don't have to worry that my arms will give out. He enjoys being with me while I do things around the house. I had one with his sister and they are just so handy. With both of them, when they saw me coming towards them with it, their little faces would light up because they knew they were be close to Granny!"
138076,1,I am currently pregnant with baby number 2. DD has the twilight ladybug so I of course had to get the turtle for baby 2. I love it. It is so soft and works great and looks amazing at night. DD loves her and I can't wait for new baby to love their too.
101978,2,"These stickers are really cute and make a little girl feel like the true princess that they really are, so we decorated my daughters bathroom with the stickers. They looked so cute when we had finished. To my dismay, the next morning when we went into her bathroom they were peeling or coming down. She was so sad and so was I. They cost over $20 so they are definitely not worth that. They may better attach to a notebook or something but the name of them are Self-Stick Wall Decorating Kit, so you do the math. I am very disappointed in them and I feel like the name is misleading."
2003,1,"My son is almost two, and has used many different brands of diapers. The only one that has held up to the challenge of a very bouncy two year old boy was the pampers baby dry. He pulls and tugs at them, colors on them with paint and markers, stretches them over his head (when they are clean), puts them around his legs and runs through the house, play on the playground with just the diaper on. And through all of that, they still work. Only once has a pampers baby dry leaked while he was wearing it. I love the diaper, you get more for your money, and they really do work. I wouldn't use any other!"
134480,0,"We received the wipes warmer as a gift. I was very excited, since I remember the days when we heated wipes in the microwave to warm them! The wipes warmer didn't seem to warm the wipes quite enough, since by the time you wipe the baby, they are already cold! Also, the pad on the bottom MUST stay wet at all times, or else it turns an ugly brown color, which won't wash out in the laundry as indicated in the directions for use. One major problem we had was that when the lid of the warmer is opened, water often trickled down the lid and onto the oak dresser that we used as a changing station. We had to put a cloth diaper under the unit to prevent it from damaging the dresser. It could be better designed. We have continued to use it however, since it is just too inconvenient to use the microwave, and a slightly warm wipe is better than a cold one."
94042,1,"Suffering a UV tract infection; TWO different attempts to 'cure' with Prescription AntiBiotics did NOTHING!Finally found this, and it worked brilliantly, 100%! I couldn't recommend this higher!The reason I trusted this brand in the first place is, Green Vibrance is the single best supplement I've ever tried, energizing, helps get over colds or flu; and every I turn it onto agrees completely, so Green Vibe. is also recommended highly.Thanks!"
125121,0,"I really wanted to love this teether. It's just ok in my opinion. It is made of silicone and is one piece, unlike the two color versions of the teether. It is large for my son, but he is only 5 months old. He doesn't really like the bulb end, he prefers to chew on the handle instead. I think he'd take it or leave it...it's not my go to teether I was looking for. Like all things baby, I think it's just the babies personality of whether or not they like a product. For parental concern, I believe this product is safe for your child to use if he/she likes it."
100925,1,I've used these on all my 3 kids and love them!!!! Very rarely do they leak and the kids all seemed comfortable with them. My youngest has super sensitive skin and these don't bother him at all like some other brands do.
120876,1,"Gate was easy to install. Easy to open. Closes automatically, which is great. Goes great with room. Would definitely recommend to buy. Will buy exact gate again when another is needed."
71728,1,Our granddaughter LOVES her walking wings and it has saved grandma and granpa's backs. This is fun and oh-so-helpful!
98569,1,"Fits perfectly in my Honda Odyssey, and my son loves sitting in it! I love that I can keep him in the 5-point harness so long!"
172546,2,"I purchased this tub thinking with all the bells & whistles It would be great. It turned out to be quite the opposite. I got the saftey 1st fold up tub at my shower and it turned out to be a great tub to fold up and store when not in use but after five months the non-skid pad starting coming up where the tub folds so I thought I would start looking to buy a different tub.Well I spotted this tub and thought that it would be great since it had the mesh stand, the water temp indicator and the ""gentle"" shower nozzle.Well when I got it home and set it up it turned out to be the worst tub for the money. The gentle shower hardly sprayed at all let alone enough to rinse off a baby. I got frustrated with it and yelled at my husband to bring me a cup. My daughter did not like sitting in the tub either. She never cried once when I bathed her and well when I put her in it she cried through the entire bath. She got cold becuase she wasn't getting rinsed off fast enough. The spray nozzle was also difficult to operate when your hands are wet.The other problem I ran into was that my daughter is 24"" long and she kept kicking the water resorvoir and it kept getting knocked out of place. So after the first bath which ended up being the last I immediately packed it back up and took it back to the store.Do not waste your money on this tub. If I had read the reviews on it I wouldn't have had to waste my time with it. So far the reviews on these baby products have turned out to be really good to the consumer."
21404,1,Great product. My daughter's preschool has one of these and she loves it. We got it for my kids for Christmas. My 1 year old daughter can't seem to get enough jumping in. I love the fact that it has a handle bar to hold onto. Tough to put together though. You definatley need two people to put it together and you need to read the directions thouroghly before putting it together. Once its put together though it is wonderful. Great way for the kids to get in exercise and use up their energy.
139444,1,"We purchased two of the Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Lights, Lady Bug for our two 8 year old great granddaughters and were delighted with the product and the shipping service. These Lady Bugs were actually more than we had hope for and we couldn't be happier. They are educational as well as functional, and we highly recommend them."
129066,1,"I just received this as a gift and we love it! It's really easy to transport too and keeps my 2 month old captivated. The materials are nice and it's a well made product and very soft, perfect for your little bundle of joy. I love the colors that contrast with the black and white. The delivery was prompt and I would definitely buy this for anyone who has a new baby in the future. Wonderful product! I love that it comes with a few accessories too and that you don't have to purchase them separately. Even though there are cute accessories you can buy in addition, which is nice too. We absolutely love it."
78276,2,"I think the seat is convenient because it folds up for travel, but it's not very sturdy and I don't like it because my son had no problem popping the tray off, and food went flying everywhere.I gave it a second chance and the same thing happened. Now I just use a hand-me-down Fisher Price solid plastic booster seat. It also has a seat belt, but it's much more sturdy."
44016,0,"I loved the idea of having a bubble bath dispenser but the soap leaks out overnight.I knew that it was made for tub faucets with shower levers on top, only by looking at the picture. When I got this we had a shower lever on the front of the faucet, but were building a house and made sure that our new faucet would have a lever on top.It didn't work on the front lever faucet, and doesn't work on our higher end top lever faucet either. It seems to just hang on there. We still use it because it does only what it's really supposed to do which is prevent our daughter from sticking her fingers in the faucet or hitting her head on metal.I wish the spring was a little tighter so it felt secure and I wish the bubble bath didn't leak out overnight."
136339,1,"I love this excersaucer. My son was almost 4 months old when we got it and I put him in it right away. I had to help support him with a bundled up blanket in the front but he was able to reach most of the toys easily and the buttons are very easy to press so his natural hand motions activated sounds and lights. It entertains him for 20-45 minutes at a time. He is on the tall side at 27 1/4 "" and able to support himself on his legs as well. I don't have any problems with any of the toys like som other customers had written and I think it only took 6 batteries. I expecially like that it bounces with his bigger movements and is steady when he is steady. I would recommend this to anyone!"
124748,1,This walker was so easy to assemble and the resistance was adjustable. My Grandson loved it. It was without a doubt the best of all the Xmas gifts. He uses it now so often and loves it. I thank all the consumers out there who took the time to write a review. I would never have bought it without all those positive reviews. This is a gift that will last and that you would save for the next grandchild. Worth the price.
36114,1,"I bought a ""Lite On Shoulder"" Pouch/Rigs Hybrid Sling, the green batik pattern and loved it! My friends had expensive $100 ring slings and I loved mine so much. It was so comfortable for me and my daughter. I unfortunately misplaced it between babies and had to buy another one. I bought the same kind but in the wine batik pattern. I think I love it even more! So happy with the product and the price. Also, it arrived within a week. Thank you!!"
67697,0,"I've tried many different ways, but cannot find any position in which I would be able to fold the stroller with the cup holder attached.May be only on the soft part of the handle, but this would leave a permanent mark on the handle, which I am not willing to do without trying other cup holders.Otherwise a nice cupholder, the rotating feature is great, holds the cup very firm."
91590,1,"The best thing about this bag is all the compartments and the handy size of each one. The front pockets can hold things as large as diapers and a pack of wipes. There is a small interior pocket at the top of the bag that is great to stash ""mommy"" stuff, like a wallet or something- when shopping. This is a larger sized bag, larger than I expected from the picture."
81992,2,"These Leak!!!!! After having a low milk supply and putting and incredible amount of work into pumping and saving milk for later, just to find out that I would loose all the milk I saved due to leaking. HORRIBLE. Worst ever. Do not purchase these. The seam comes apart after freezing and as the milk thaws it leaks out. There is no point to these bags if they will not do there job. Very unsanitary and incredibly frustrating to loose your hard earned milk. Please dont make the mistake I did."
171076,1,This is very cute and durable. They love pictures especially of people they know. Loved it! Would recommend this to a friend.
1522,1,"I was loyal to Pampers until Costco had a deal on Huggies and i decided to give Huggies a shot. I was not disappointed, but, the biggest difference between the two brands is that Pampers are MUCH SOFTER than Huggies. Pampers felt more like fabric while Huggies were very plasticy and felt like an itchy material. HOWEVER, huggies are much more absorbent and dont get as bulky as pampers. But, i put comfort over size of the diaper and I love pampers."
61286,2,"I *had* to have this when I was pregnant, thinking it was the one necessity. My mom said &quot;that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen; what a waste of money.&quot; I chalked it up to her general party-pooping personality. Guess what? I hate it, and haven't used it in months. Instead, the diapers get put on the changing table til the baby is dressed, then I carry it to the kitchen trash. Please don't buy this, it's such a waste.First, the bags are special refills; you can't just use regular trash bags. Second, it just doesn't hold the smell out. As soon as you open it, you get treated to the stench of 30 diapers. Even when it's been emptied, it still reeks. It's just too complicated to put a diaper in there when you have a squirming baby on the table, and it hardly holds anything so you're constantly having to change the refill. As if you don't have enough to do as a mom, the last thing you want to do is have to deal with the million steps it takes to change the refill.I so wish I had a hands-free pail, that takes a regular garbage bag. Worst part? My mom was right *again*."
169358,0,"I like this design but there are 2 major flaws. First, the plastic they use contains BPA. Second, the little containers don't keep out air and moisture so if you leave the powder formula in it too long they get dried and hardened....!"
133975,1,"I have a very colicky baby and bought this just strictly to avoid startling her with cold wipes in the middle of the night. But it also is excellent because it is easy to use with one hand and is excellent at keeping the wipes moist. We just add water everytime we add wipes and it is always enough. I also found that the off price wipes at Babys-r-us work well with this dispensor. The only ones that don't work so far are the huggy style, and that is only because they are not designed for any pop up style dispensor."
39146,2,"Our other car seat bag is the Eddie Bauer one. Getting a full sized carseat into the Sunshine Kids bag is as much of a wrestling match as it is with the Eddie Bauer bag; however, the Eddie Bauer bag is made of far better materials. We thought we'd take a chance with this since the Eddie Bauer bag is now tough to find and more $$$ + this Sunshine Kids bag got decent reviews. The EB one has held up to many trips where the people in baggage have dragged it across the pavement... The Sunshine Kids bag however did not. The bag was very worn, but not ripped after our first flight. When we attempted to put in the carseat for our return flight, the bag riped in the biggest wear spot. In fact, just the stress of trying to get the seat in the bag caused a rip nearly the full length of the bag. The airline had to put it all into a plastic bag b/c it was such a useless mess. So, all these people who left glowing reviews are just lucky...that's all.This product is a total piece of junk!!!!!!!!"
132384,1,Honestly i was one of those dads who said i don't need this type of product. But now i wish i had one in the car with me for road trips lol. It makes the babies bottom feel good and no clinching!Great product wish i wouldve thought of it first lol.
11223,0,"This playard is good like all the Pack and Play basic playards. It folds relatively easily and the wheels are convenient to move it from one room to the other. I really like the attachment that stores diapers,cream, wipes (in a small case) and pacifiers. Some models don't have this attachment which is really useful. But I didn't like the mobile nor the sound device. The bears are too pale and it doesn't have any music or movement. My daughter didn't like it at all. The sounds and light device is another disaster because the light is too low and you almost can't hear the music (I just put it away). I have the Winnie the Pooh playard and its mobile is much better although it doesn't have a space to store anything."
106965,2,i am wondering if anyone can tell me if this would be ok to use with cloth diapers.i am a cloth diaper mom and i am having a hard time finding a cloth diaper pail.out of all the ones i seen this one looks like it might do the job.btw i only rated so low cause i never used it LOL[...]
6808,1,"Ordered 3 Pampus Cruisers with free shipping, and received them in less than a week in prefect condition. Love Amazon.com!"
176548,0,"I have mixed feelings about this kit. I'll start with the reasons why I like it. It comes with your 4oz. and 8oz. bottles with a variety of nipples to choose from. The disposable bags and drop-ins already come with. These make your baby less gassy because you can push the air out. They are really easy to warm. You just run them under your faucet. They are also easy to clean. Now let me tell you my dislikes. The drop-in refills or the bags are kind of pricy when you have to buy a new box 2-3 times a month. They may give you a variety of nipples, but you can't even use them all in the beginning stages. Some are marked infant and some older child. The ones that are for the older children have too much of a flow coming out and would cause chocking with a younger baby. Then they only give you like one infant nipple so you have to go out and buy more nipples anyway. I'd recommend buying one separately to see if you like it first before commiting yourself to an entire box. And make sure that you want to keep spending the money on the refills when there is so much other things to buy."
179339,2,great bottles they work in beggining but after you had them for a while they stat to leak like crazy. if you take them in your diaper bag youl have a wet mess i love them but hate that they all leak i had to replace them for new different ones i love the NUK bottles they also have a vent on the nipple so now my new favorite. i had 15 ventiair bottles and its sad they were all garbage :(
7698,1,"2 key thoughts when buying items like this on Amazon. First is you need to smell the spray someplace else first. Second, is that it should smell good on your person.I smelled this in a magazine and took a shot. I love it and the wife loves it. Highly recommend for the right person."
5945,1,"This is an incredible product! These outlet covers are super easy to install (I usually shy away from anything that requires a screw driver or other tools) and esthetically pleasing. I wish I had known about this product 2 years ago when my daughter was born, but at the time we opted for the simple plugs, which not only look ugly, but also end up lying around all over the house. I had to find an alternative because my daughter wants to plug in the Christmas tree lights by herself and have found a safe option in this product. I'm ordering enough for the rest of my house!!"
101278,1,These are the only diapers I have bought my son for over a year. They are very absorbent. I love getting these shipped straight to my door every month.
121484,0,"I thought this product was larger than it really is - Note that the Amazon dimensions must be the box it ships in. Under details it does state that this is only 16"" high. This is more of a disappointment to me because I plan to use it for cloth diapers, and it doesn't look like it would hold more than 8-10 at most. The quality is what you'd expect for the price - adequate."
163870,1,My wife loves it. She complained how uncomfortable she was. After buying the pillow she was a lot happier.
91809,2,I too could not get this product to work. The suction cups did not stay attached no matter what I tried (other than only using an inch of water which I think is ridiculous.) The other problem with this is the strong smell of vinyl. We all know now that its not good for you and certainly not for young bodies. I returned this product.
144653,1,So far this car seat has been great...it is easy to adjust and the infant insert is great and very comfortable for our month old son. Highly recommended!
92392,1,"Everyone who has a bottle-feeding baby needs to have this warmer. Even if you don't go on many roadtrips, just a trip out to a store or in town for the day will make you glad you have it. It is SO much more convenient than having to stop at a McDonalds and ask for a cup of steaming hot water. I was surprised at the negative reviews on this site as I have used mine for both of my boys when they were babies - which means it has held up for two and a half years so far. Even if it hadn't, I'd shell out the measly $15 to buy another.A couple things based on some reviews I read:*It is paramount that you push the buttons in a particular order. Why? I don't know, but it's simple. Once you have plugged it in, you hit the ON button, then one of the bottle size buttons (I personally always use the 8oz size regardless), then pres ON *again*. If it doesn't work, pull it out and put it back in - it may not have connected right with your car. You should feel it get warm within 15-30 seconds.*Of course it can create a hot spot in your milk, that's why you give it a shake before you give it to your baby. Any method of heating can do that*If it melts your bottle, you are leaving your bottle in WAY too long. 10 minutes max!Obviously this will not work with drop-in liner bottles because the milk needs to be touching the side of the bottle for the warmth to transfer. HOWEVER, I used these bottles with my first son and all I did was bring a regular bottle along in the car that I would pour the water/milk into, then heat that bottle and simply pour the heated milk into our drop-in liner bottle. Not a big deal when you figure it saves you precious time with a screaming baby."
162101,2,"I got this tub from a close friend and the first time I tried to use it, it leaked! I found that if you don't extend the tub it leaks to much. Not a good tub to buy!"
39698,1,I can not express to you how delicious this lotion smells. I also use the foaming wash. As if babies need anything else to make them more irresistable!
19909,2,"The product looks good...but the suction cup does NOT hold bowl in place for more that 1 min!!!I've tried every single bowl with suction cup on it, hoping to prevent my daughter from dumping the bowl with food on the floor...so far I haven't had any luck!I would suggest the maker of this product to try a bigger suction cup...this one is to little! Won't do its job!"
153865,1,"Excellent wipes. Not too wet or bulky, tough but not abrasive. I bought a case and when they're gone I'll buy more."
184786,1,This is an excellent choice for twins. It keeps them separate but together for ease of access. While accommodating both it fits in the same area as a crib.
72285,1,"When I first got this and started putting it together, I had the same problem as another one of the reviewers. I couldn't get the seat to go around the column. It seemed to get stuck at the column's seams. I was totally frustrated and was getting ready to call customer service. I was looking through the instruction booklet for the phone number when I saw a page that talked about locking the seat in one position. That was the way the seat was acting. I looked and sure enough, the seat was locked. Once I unlocked it, the seat went around the column beautifully. My son is 4 months old. He's a little young for this right now. He can't sit up by himself, he can't reach the floor, and he gets overwhelmed with all of the toys. However, I believe he will enjoy it when he's a little older."
142432,0,"I was very disappointed to find when I opened the box I could tell this product had been returned to Amazon and they sold it to me. The inside box was not sealed and the plastic ties around the bars had been cut. One of the bars was bent and would not fit in the proper hole(which is probably the reason it was returned in the first place) I was finally able to connect the bar after prying and prying to make it fit.The product is overall a good product, it took hardly any time to put together after I had the trouble with the bent piece. It is nice that the bars hide under the mattress, it does take a few minutes to collapse to fit under the mattress but worth it in my book."
29251,1,"Surprise! I am using this little handy dandy stool when I sit for an extended time, i.e. on the computer, at a table, watching TV, cat sitting.It elevates my legs just to the right, comfortable hight.Sometimes I use it like a little stepping stool.Am very happy with my purchase.Lindmuth Fuller, Gar's wife"
34262,1,"I purchased this bag when I was traveling with my infant son. I will start off by saying that I thought the quality of this bag exceeded my expectations. The canvas material is very thick and durable. The zippers are wide and sturdy. The straps are attached very well and have a thick, durable strap material. I purchased a stroller bag from my stroller's manufacturer and was very disappointed in the quality. Based on the quality of this car seat bag, I wish that I would have purchased a stroller bag from this manufacturer as well.I was able to easily fit my Chicco Key Fit 30 Infant Car Seat and Base into this bag. It seems as though this bag is likely constructed for a convertible or forward facing carseat, but I was able to fit my infant car seat into it without too much of a struggle. I just popped the carseat into the base and then put the entire thing in the bag. I was able to easily carry the carseat on my back and push the stroller or pull the suitcase. The straps make it very manageable. We have a Britax Marathon Convertible Carseat and I tried it out in the bag...fit in easily.I took a previous reviewers advice and was able to an additional bag in with the carseat in the bag. Even with the carseat in there, I had plenty of room for other items (though I would heed the previous reviewers advice to not overload it, due to weight restrictions). Though it is probably an isolated case, I will tell you that when we went to baggage claim for our trip on the way down, the bag was unzippered and the bag inside was hanging out. Now, I'm not sure if TSA opened the bag to check the carseat and didn't put it back in properly (likely case in my opinion) or someone tried to break into the bag. I really don't see how the bag would have come open otherwise because the zippers are very secure. For that reason, I'm not faulting the bag at all. That said, if you put anything inside, I would highly recommend not leaving it loose. I would put it in a bag and then probably loop the straps of the bag to the carseat somehow (i.e. loop straps through the carseat buckles). I did this and didn't end up with anything missing, but had I put loose items in, I probably would have been missing some stuff.Of note, at the time of this review, you should not have to pay extra to check a carseat nor does it count towards any free luggage allowance. I will tell you, at different airports it came out at different baggage claims. Once it came out with the normal baggage and once it came out in oversized items. If you can't find it with the regular baggage, check the oversized area."
4,2,"The suction on this dish does not really work. The only thing I could get it to suction to was glass. we never really wanted it for the warming part, just for the suction. All in in all, we were not very satisfied with this purchase."
112566,1,"I've tried them all, and Pampers are the only brand that fits my kids' butts for some reason. The Cruisers are a little less bulky, which I prefer, although the kids don't seem to care. And with the Economy Pack, they're *almost* reasonably priced..."
169804,0,"Received this as a gift off our baby registry (our daughter is due in May). The product arrived quickly, and I was very excited until my husband had almost finished putting it together and discovered a crack in one of the side panels. It probably would have been fine, but we're picky and were concerned about the crack worsening and risking our daughter's safety...so we sent it back. We received a replacement maybe a week later. This time we were smart and examined all the pieces before lifting a finger to assemble it, and it's a good thing we did, because THAT one was damaged too. This time one of the shelves had a pretty sizeable split in the wood. Needless to say I was not a happy camper, nor was my husband. After venting my frustration with Amazon customer service, the rep I talked to said he would pass a note to the shipping department to pack the item more carefully. Why they had not done that from the start is beyond me. About a week later we finally received our THIRD changing table. After inspecting it with a fine-toothed comb, we decided the third time was the charm. This one didn't have a scratch on it and once we got it set up we were happy, if a little frustrated it took nearly three weeks to receive one that wasn't damaged. Anyway, the changing table is very spacious and looks good in our nursery/office. We also received the Storkcraft Beatrice 5-drawer chest off our registry, and it is also cherry, and the two items are almost a perfect match, color-wise. It seems sturdy also, and was easy to assemble. I would recommend it to others as long as you have the patience and the time to deal with getting a replacement if it doesn't arrive in good condition."
76663,1,We bought it to use in a rental on vacation. It's easy to setup. You have to use the belt positioning strap to make sure the seat belt does not go over your kids neck. The cup holder seems pretty useless. Other than that it works as described
167170,1,"I purchased this seat to replace my grandson's first car seat. After searching and researching what would be the best seat we decided on the Marathon Convertible. We feel it is very safe, comfortable, easily installed and best of all my grandson really seems to like it. Purchasing it from Amazon was a very pleasant experience and delivery was in 2 days."
141554,2,"This toy has alot of activities, but is not a very good walker. It would keep my son occupied, but when he would stand up to push it, he would lean over and just play with the buttons instead of pushing it.If he did start pushing it, it is so light weight, it would just scoot ahead so fast. I was scared he was going to fall on his face. They should make the wheels alittle more tighter so it is easier for the child to control."
5314,1,"I was traveling with my son from Idaho to London, and so had 3 flights each way, with the various layover times i knew i needed to have a stroller for my son who was 10mths. I had read many reviews over the gate check bags for strollers and thought this seemed the best. Please note the following: The padding is only at the top (great if all your wheels go to one end) unfortunately mine did not. The strap was fine but the clips looked weak (they survived as i didn't rely on them). The biggest draw back was trying to get the stroller into the bag! Imagine you are on your own, holding your child (who is rather miffed that they have been removed from the comfort of the stroller) dangling is a better word than holding.... collapse the stroller with one hand, clip it shut, open the bag up and try to shove it length ways into the bag and zip it up... all the while they are calling your seat number, your diaper bag, handbag and other useful junk is now flung across the waiting area floor as you struggle to get all on your shoulders. It is definitely at least a two person job (three would be better, one to hold your child, and two to put the stroller in). However, if you are not going to be putting it in and taking it out then this is the best one for you. It did not have any cuts, tears or damage after 6 flights and the stroller was very well protected."
27324,1,"The stroller is a great buy, it is sturdy, easy to strap the baby in and seeming very comfortable for him- he falls asleep in it every day during our walk!"

168299,0,"Size 1 was best diapers ever, so we went further on with a brand. Especially since the price is very close. As we got to a size 2, 3. I'm not sure there is possibility that we had little problems here and there but not as much. Summer came and we got on #3, heat rashes came up, we always used Vaseline and other products to avoid it, nothing helped. All kinds of other rashes came up. There was even this huge pimple that was or a private spot. It's not because we didn't change it enough, but I came to find out that Pampers uses chloride for a smell purpose, and that was a reason she was getting bad rashes. As soon we switched it to different ones that don't have as much stuff in it, it all went away. We are going with Huggies now, even though they leak time to time. I prefer dealing with a leak rather than a terrifying rashes. I never leave bad reviews usually, but I had to worn you in case it happens to your baby!"
93669,1,"I bought this potty to encourage my little one to go potty. I ended up removing the batteries, because he ONLY wanted to hear it play music. He would go only enough to break the beam and hear music... not enough to empty his bladder.After using ANOTHER potty seat to get him to go potty, he now uses his chair (and sings the fanfare himself when he goes)... HOWEVER... the pee comes out from around the pot... all over the floor (thank goodness we have it on tile floors rather than our carpeting!)..."
121732,1,"If I could have given this 10 stars I would have. This is possibly the most versatile baby product you will ever own.

Buy this, you won't be sorry!!"
135516,1,"I bought this after reviewing several baby monitors. Everywhere I searched there were always a few extreme negative reviews, except for this one. Many people had reviewed this to be a good one. So decided to go for it. I am happy with it. I have only used it on one channel so far ( it comes with two ). I hear a little humming on one channel but it's not noticeable or annoying. It may not be the case on the second channel, I haven't tried it as the slight humming does not bother me much. It picks up my baby's cry clearly as well as any other noises happening anywhere in the room. I would recommend this monitor to others."
129227,1,This has made it threw 2 kids and still looks brand new! It has bright colors so it's fun and inviting. Great for teething babies.
136791,1,"I was little sceptical about buying this bumper after reading the reviews on-line, but it's just fine and I like it. It doesn't smell funny, it is a nice green color and it does the job. It's nothing over the top, but a great bumpoer for the price."
66018,2,but $5! My son is almost 8 wks old and has problems with gas for 4 of those weeks. We changed his formula to soy thinking that would help and it did but only for a week. His gassienes was so bad it would cause him to waken every 15 minutes if he wasnt in a sound sleep. We tried Milicon along with his formula to no avail. So one day while shopping I came upon these bottles. I bought one and came home to read all the reviews on them. Out of 144 there were only a handful of bad ones. So I was soo excited to think that my son could be a happier baby! After one use my son cried for almost and hour and half straight. SO I thought maybe we had to give it a few more tries. After a total of five tries we gave up! He would drink one ounce and have violent burps and even more gas!! The formula would come out too fast and the nipple he would choke on. I didnt mind the cleaning if it ment a happy baby! It was pretty easy to clean! I am happy for those babies that it workes for but we went back to our Platex Nurser for now.
117879,2,"My wife an I were happy to find these for both safety and aesthetic reasons. We bought two and were so pleased with them we bought two more. But after about a month of using them, two of the four stopped working, so now there is just a bulky box hanging on the end of our blind cords, making them possibly more dangerous then when I started. I would not recommend this product for anyone."
135531,2,Worst piece of junk I've ever bought. The inflatable piece wouldn't blow up like it was supposed to and the legs were very wobaly. Returned it immediately.
158659,0,I tried this out for my 4 month old and it's just ok I found the baby dee sack to be alot better.
145578,1,"I originally went searching for the original Jumperoo but this was the only one available in the stores. It has some fun toys and it does spin around. My complaint is the height levels on this thing. My son is almost 7 months old and still is not tall enough for the shortest height level. We tried to rig it by using the space below the first level, but that doesn't give much of a jump. I am going to try to put a pillow under to see if that helps. They also seemed to forget the seams to separate the second and third adjustment levels, but since we haven't even made it comfortably to the first level, we may never need to go to those levels. Right now he only lasts 5 minutes in this vs. half an hour in the exersaucer which he loves bouncing in. So far I am disappointed."
104872,1,"This bib is absolutely gorgeous. I received this item at my baby shower, after putting it on my registry, thinking it was overpriced and never thinking anyone would pay this money. Well I received two bibs and a set of burp cloths and I can't wait to use them. I'm going to buy some myself."
35362,1,"This definitely is a great extension to the practically useless sunshade that comes with any umbrella stroller. We have the MaClaren Quest Sport and this is a perfect match. It provides plenty of shade for our baby. It is key to understand that if your stroller does not already have a sunshade, this product is not for you simply because it must sit on top of an existing sunshade in order to stay up. My only complaints are (1) that it doesn't really adjust although you can kind of pull it up like a sleeve on a shirt if you wanted to see your baby more and (2) you have to tie it onto the stroller whenever you want to use it. Velcro would've been a better solution, IMO. Overall, it's a great product and does exactly as it describes... i.e. provides more shade for your baby."
93492,1,"this is a wonderful product - it not only came with the potty - but books, information packs, a chart and stickers for successful trips to the potty!! Can't wait to get started!! My daughter loves checking out the music when she sits. I think it will really help ease the transition!!"
14832,1,"These are the only bottles my daughter wanted to drink from. They have a nice wide neck so it is also easy to clean. I never had a problem with these leaking at all. I also love these bottles for when i would formula feed her. Again because of the wide neck, I never had a problem with any powder spilling all over the place. And the caps stay snugly in place. I also like the fact that they make the nipples with different flows for different ages so i never had a problem with my daughter choking, not getting enough, or getting too little.My daughter is now 14 months old and drinks from a cup. I still have these bottles, and i plan on using them for my son who is due in february."
57443,0,"I bought this bouncer when my second daughter was born. The feature that, in my opinion, is the greatest asset is the deep seat and the dramatic recline. Honestly, there is nothing more troubling than seeing a newborn propped almost at a 90 degree angle with their chin to their chest. So, this bouncer made for a more relaxed sleep/rest position for a small baby or newborn.One thing I hated was the toy car. Its flimsey, doesn't stay on (even just bumping the chair made it fall down in front of the baby or off entirely) and I found it a complete nuisance. I ended up throwing the toy bar away completely.The other complaint I have is that the Boppy company must not have really tested out the padded insert well. While the head-rest has a piece of velcro to secure it in place, the actual insert that provides cushion on either side of the baby is free floating. Baby just slowly slides down in the seat. I had to make it common practice to pick my daughter up and scoot her bottom up higher in the chair for about every 20 minutes she was in it.Overall, I don't have any major negative qualms with the bouncer. It served it's purpose. However, for $50 I do think there are BETTER options out there and will be purchasing a different bouncer for my third child."

97388,1,"My sister-in-law made the recomendation of The First Years Easy Comfort Single Breast Pump and at first I was aprhensive about an electric pump. However, after a month of using a manual pump my husband insisted that I look for an electric. The Easy Comfort was in our price range, truthfully it has been a blessing. The motor is not too lound, and it is very easy to travel with. It also cut down on the amount of time it took me to pump."
168811,1,i have used pampers Swaddlers for all 3 of my kids. I have never had an issue with leaking unles they needed the next size up or I left them too long in the diaper.
169037,1,"My kid is very satisfied with this diaper...1. He does not have any rashes or redness using these diapers.2. These diapers do not pass the wetness to the baby, they soak it all.3. Baby does not feel uncomfortable wearing these4. And cherry on the top is - using Amazon's Subscribe and save, you can get it cheapest over here.5. Product arrives before time without any distortion"
31003,2,"My wife read all of the reviews for this stroller prior to the birth of our second child and decided to purchase this stroller online. It is, by far, the worst stroller that I have ever used. The dimensions are such that it is rather tall and skinny so it has a tendency to be difficult to turn when you want to, but driveway slopes tend to force you down into the street if you are not holding on very tightly. As far as looks, ease of folding, and overall features are concerned, it is a fine product. I am a healthy 34-year old dad who finds this really difficult to maneuver. I wouldn't even think of trying to take it to a crowded place or store. Who knows, maybe I just got a dud, but I would recommend trying this out at a store before purchasing."
146630,1,My son loves it! Very entertaining. The only negative that I have is that the music and sounds are annoying. There is this elephant sound constantly going off.
10460,1,"Perfect size for infant, or maybe even up to 6months (give or take some months). A nice color as well. Also, very convenient if you don't have a lot of space, since you can easily fold it right back up. I also love how there is a place where you can put the washcloth, and other baby products for the bath. :D"
173726,1,"This was the best purchase for my new son ethan. He naps better in here than in a crib. THe many musical choices are beautiful (nature soothing sounds as he sleeps). There is a gorgeous mobile over his head with a mirror so baby can watch the birds spin around and also watch his reflection. The seat is SO soft and conformed to keep baby in the natural womb like position. It is such a soothing item to just look at with the colors and sounds. We keep it beside a tv and he still passes out hard while the volume of the tv is on right beside him. Finally, the choice to rock like a swing OR a cradle is just great- it is like buying a 2 for one deal- a cradle and a swing. This is very pricey but a must own."
160917,1,"My husband is a stay home father and I wanted to avoid him having to tote around anything that looked like a purse or a woman's bag. Our son's bedroom is all hunting camo and so when i saw this bag I had to have it for my husband. the bag is wonderful very different than a woman's bag bit perfect and fitting for a man. I even get compliments on this bag when I wear it. The bag works for both genders and is very unique.The number of pockets might disappoint some people as a traditional diaper bag is very roomy and has many many pockets. Some people may find this bag a little disappointing if you are used to huge bags with a ton of room. However it fits everything you will need for an all day outing and even over night if need be. We can fit, 6 diapers, 3 burp cloths, 1 outfit, wipes, 3 bibs, and other odds and ends like food, spoons and sunscreen."
125792,1,"My baby is 8 weeks and I have been having a lot of problems w/mastitis. I ended up with a breast abscess because of a blocked milk duct when he was 5 weeks old and had to exclusively pump to feed him following my surgery to drain the abscess. I bought the Isis IQ UNO initially for once a day pumping so that others could help me with the middle of the night feeding and it worked great. I was worried the pump wouldn't hold up to exclusive pumping to feed my son after my surgery but I was pleasantlly surprised. I have been pumping 8 times a day for 3 weeks now using the Isis IQ UNO. I am able to empty both breasts (4-6ozs) at each session in about 20 mins total. I used the Medela pump at the hospital and would say the suction is about equivalent to the hosptial grade pump set on minimum so I would say this pump works well for moms who have easy let down and good milk supply and probably not so good for moms who need very strong suction to draw the milk out. The instructions don't tell you but the pump loses suction power when the diaphragm stretches from frequent use so try changing it out if you feel the pump is not as strong as before. If the Avent Isis manual pump works for you then you'll be happy with this one - it really saves your hands if you are pumping regularly. Note that the although the pump tries to replicate your pumping pattern, the automatic pumping rhythm is not exact and slightly slower than your pumping pattern.The battery pack is very handy but you do need to use the expensive high capacity batteries and still you only get few sessions, so it's not practical if you need to pump often away from an outlet. As another reviewer has said, it's difficult to detach the electric part of the pump without pulling out the diaphragm which can get messy. It often feels like the diaphragm is stuck and you're going to break the movable piece on the electric pump part if you pull too hard. Instead of pulling, I put my thumb on the plastic piece on the diaphragm and snap it off at an angle which seems to work so far.I would highly recommend this pump if you like the Avent Isis manual pump and only need to pump occasionally. If you need to pump frequently, I would recommend a double pump. Pumping really gets old pretty quickly if you need to do it round the clock so do anything to cut down on the time it takes to take care of business. Don't get this pump if you need more than the minimum setting on the hospital Medela breast pump - this pump won't be strong enough for you (see the negative reviews for the Avent Isis IQ UNO to get an idea why it won't work for you)."
37819,0,"This item is good for the money. A couple of the items, like the digital thermometer seem a little cheaply made. On the other hand, the rubber grips on the tweezers and nail clipper are great. It also comes with a bulb suringe which is much better than the new bulbs that do not suck very well."
27711,1,We have really liked it. One of the attachments for the cover was broken in the box but InStep shipped us one out without a problem. I would recommend this stroller.
60379,1,"I would highly recommend this bathtub. My son was three months old when I got the tub. He's been enjoying taking bath ever since. The molds are in right places, so that the baby stays in place, and at the same time, it's very easy to wash him thoroughly. The large size enables him to kick his feet as if he's swimming."
13340,1,Unless I was in a recliner I could not nurse without this product. As my baby grew it became the perfect toddler step-stool for the bathroom. It gets thrown around quite a bit and has stayed together beautifully. Great value.
184562,1,I use three of these on my thick glass coffee table and my two glass end tables and they work perfectly. My 15 month old has lost her balance several times and has hit her mouth and luckily the bumpers were there to protect her. I highly recommend them over the other bumper products.
178664,1,Great baby carrier. Easy to put on and secure my baby. I love taking my little one around in this carrier. I never have issues with Bjorn products.
72960,1,"We purchased two of these booster seats. One to keep at our house for traveling and one to keep at grandma and grandpa's house. This booster folds flat, is light weight and easy to put together. Very durable seat."
104053,0,"i searched everywhere to find modern baby blankets. i loved these designs by modern basics. unfortunately after just two washings, it's starting to lose its trim. the green stitching is coming loose both on the outline of the hippo, as well as on the outer edge trim. it doesn't seem to be holding up very well"
108853,1,"Our baby had very bad cradle cap (and has very sensitive skin) and within a few days of use we notice improvements and within a few weeks her head was cradle cap fee and very soft.It also smells pretty good.Note: we were also putting the Mustela cradle cap *lotion* on her head every night for about a week before we got this, so that was helping to; the most significant changes were when we started with the shampoo."
74180,0,"I got this stroller after having the babyjogger double. I have a 2.5 year old and an 8 month old. The 2.5 year old refuses to sit for more than 5 minutes at a time and I was pushing a double stroller with one kid in it. I thought the joovy would be a good option to keep her corralled at least. Out of the box it took me an easy 10 minutes or less to put it together. The quality of product is great and I love that you don't have to buy a carseat adapter. The carseat adapter does extend out quite a bit making it difficult to take tight turns and impossible to see over. With the carseat adapter off, the stroller is much easier to push around and is extremely compact. The folding is very easy and fairly compact. My daughter thinks its a fun game to stand on the back of the stroller and pretend that she is ""skateboarding."" It keeps her occupied and this is the first stroller that she has ever actually ridden in for longer periods of time. This is an everyday short trips stroller, NOT a Disneyland stroller. The seats are compact and uncomfortable. If you have the extra $30, I'd say spring for the ultralight -- the maneuverability is worth it."
130046,0,"We have the mini Roxanne crib, which converts to a twin bed frame. After learning of the need for cross support (not included), I'm not sure it's worth it for us since the rails are so expensive. Also, FYI Walmart has the kit for $50."
104906,1,"This soap is awesome and leaves you with a very clean, peppermint scent. Especially on very hot summer days, it works wonders."
156255,1,"This stroller lives up to its advertising. It is well-made, sturdy and attractive. It's easy to use and easy to store. The product was packed well and shipped promptly. I am very pleased, and so are the kids."
140693,1,"I tried several stretch mark cremes while I was pregnant, and this one was my favorite. It doesn't break the bank, moisturizes well, and smells good. Love it!"
146807,1,"This bag is terrific. It's very roomy and fits diapers/wipes/potty seat covers/placemats/hadwipes and more! I bought it for vacation and it held everything I needed and left my hands free! But when I wanted to take everything with me say into a restaurant, it pulls right off and has a handle for carrying. I am very happy with this purchase."
149965,1,Daughter said the little ones loved them on their 3 hr. ride home from Grammy's house.They are a little soft but work fine for 3 & 4 yr olds
145897,1,Has so many features that it would be hard to go into too much detail...child hates to get out of it!!!
125219,1,My son loves this teether it helps soothes his gums when they are in pain. I would recommend to all mothers
125054,1,This is a great thing for infants. When we put out little grand-son in it he started moving around and smiling and had a great time.
161756,1,"This tub was a gift and I loved the fact that it grew with my daughter. I was able to use the sling in my kitchen sink but not for long because my daughter grew so quickly. As for everyone else saying that it was hard to set up, it was fairly easy for me. I didn't even need help from my husband. My tub doesn't leak. I like that the sling can be taken off its frame to be washed seperately. My daughter is 12 months old and I still use the sling. She likes to lay back on it while I rinse her hair. I don't have any trouble releasing the suction cups. I actually do it with one hand. All in all this tub is still serving its purpose. I would recommend it to anyone."
106357,1,"I really like the Diaper Champ. It is extremely easy to use and does a good job at containing that powerful 'diaper pail' smell. The fact that you can use ANY plastic bags is a big plus over the comparable Diaper Genie (which i have always found hard to use once there are more than a few diapers in there.)The only reason i didnt give this product 5 stars is that it is REALLY hard to open when it is time to empty it. (maybe this is just the one that i have?) Other than that, i'd purchase this product again."
79634,1,"I have a big kid (35lbs at two when he potty trained himself) and found this to be structurally sound - ie: there was no bending or bowing of the steps or seat.At 40+lbs, and approaching three, he's still using it, and for a kid who likes to do it himself - like most preschoolers - this gives him a sense of independence.It would be nice is the seat didn't slip around so easily, some sort of grippy bits underneath might be good, and if it was stable enough for him to climb on without me being in the room. It has never slid off the toilet, but it can be a bit wobbly. And actually, of late, he has climbed on successfully without me being there to watch.However I have liked this far more than I thought I would when I first assembled it almost a year ago. And more importantly - he really likes it. Which when potty training, is the point!"
25639,1,"These childproof doorstops stopped my 1 year old from pulling all the stops off and from the potential choking hazard of the little white caps on standard metal stops. They are easy to install (I'm a woman and did it myself), as they just screw into the old doorstop's hole. EASY! Plus, they look great, and I prefer them to the metal stops anyhow! At this price, you should be able to replace all the stops in your home!"
46887,0,"my one month old loves the fish but yes the motor grinds. it also has a tendency to not turn off. i have had to remove the batteries twice in order for it to stop making this terrible loud humming noise. it has also stopped making any of the sounds it is supposed to make. i don't know, maybe mine is defective???"
78839,1,I would like to know if this work with the graco nautilus? it seems a little big for the strap. Can somebody share their experience?thank you
181203,1,"Nice feature with the lights but it is not compact when folded. Also tends to slip out of the edges if you don't zest up properly but would buy again,"
145529,1,"My grandson plays and interacts with the toys on the Jumperoo and above all his favorite activity is jumping! The music is different and bearable to listen to, the music is repeating, but it depends on how the baby is interacting with the toys or jumping. The music can be totally quiet or shut off, the more active the baby is doing like jumping, the faster the music becomes.The baby was introduced to the Jumperoo when he was seven months. My grandson is a very active baby needing things to keep the baby entertained and the Jumperoo wins. The only draw back of the Jumperoo is the baby gets tired of the Jumperoo after about 20 minutes, but it is the best 20 minutes spent on jumping and playing.I highly recommend the Rainforest Jumperoo. It was the best purchase we have made for entertainment for my grandbaby."
141527,1,This one is fabulous! We had to buy a new one for our second son because our firstborn used it so much!
34723,0,"I like everything about this car seat except the straps. They are constantly twisting, and it is nearly impossible to keep them from it. This is unsafe, and it takes a LONG time to untwist sometimes. They have a mind of their own. I have to say, it is otherwise a good seat, and my son has been comfortable in it since he grew too big for his infant seat at 8 months."
18959,1,We just purchased this seat for our year old son. I really don't understand why there are so many bad reviews for this product. I had no problem adjusting the straps. It took me literally 90 seconds to pop the clips out and move them up one level and snap them back into place. My son seems very happy and comfortable in it.
107732,1,Been using this pump daily for a month now. Although it does not suck very hard it does get the job done. If you are in a hurry then get one that is ONLY 110 volt. This one works on house current AND batteries so the motor is not as strong as a house current one only. Great for sucking while driving to work or riding the subway. Can ever suck while shopping at the mall. It feels good too.
105539,0,"We use this to house our son's cloth diapers before the wash. This does a good job, the only problem is the diaper strap gets stuck when you turn the handle over and the weight pushes it down between the lid and the opening. As far as smell goes it only gets bad if you don't clean as much as you can off the diaper and periodically clean out the bin. Other than that it's a rather good container for diapers."
160899,1,"My little guys military daddy loves this bag and carries it proudly! I was a little disappointed at some of the materials it's made with, for the price I expected higher quality."
80796,1,We use these right now just for night time as they aren't easy to put on if fully clothed (no recloseable sides). We use the Huggies Pull Ups for day time for that reason. The absorbancy of these seems fine. I put them over my daughter's Huggies Good Nite Diaper to keep her dry - it sort of helps keep the under diaper from gapping.
162606,1,"I loved this tub! I had a c-section and I was in no shape to be bending over a bathtub for a few months. In any case, I would not have been comfortable putting my newborn in anything but a sink tub - so this was perfect. With respect to some of the poor reviews I read - it seems they think this tub is supposed to last forever - I only used it for 4 months - then I used a tub (Primo brand) made to go inside of an adult bath tub. At 4 months, both baby and mom were ready to graduate to the big tub. Also, I liked that you couldn't submerge the baby in this tub - I would not have felt safe submerging a newborn - one slip and their face could be under water! That's so dangerous! Plus, I never noticed my son was cold - I kept a washcloth over his torso, making sure the washcloth was warm. Only his feet and upper torso were not submerged in water. Finally, the baby stays put because of the skidproof yellow liner. I felt very in control and it was comfortable bathing him at sink level. My lower back was killing me the first few months after birth, so like I said, I could not have used anything but a sink tub in the beginning. Anyway, for a new mom, I was very comfortable using this product - I would have been very nervous with anything else. This is a great starter tub and costs less than a pizza - I loved this product!!"
79544,1,"We just purchased the wagon for our trip to Disney with our 1 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old boys. It was great for getting around the airports and folds down nicely. Here's how it worked at Disney: When we got to the park, we were told by the greeter that no pull wagons were allowed but we could still use it if we pushed. We pushed it through the gate (a struggle) and went on our way pulling. No one stopped us for the rest of the day. At the end of the day, we agreed the wagon worked pretty well - no major complaints but it seemed other guests were passively annoyed by its length and width - it was the only wagon we saw at the park so I suspect others weren't ready for it and in congested areas the maneuverability was not optimal. The second day, we opted to rent a 2 kid stroller and that worked much better. For the remainder of the week trip we rented strollers at all parks because they provided the same or more utility and were more convenience.That said, we are still quite pleased with the wagon. We plan to use it all the time this summer. It is not hard to pull and the kids love it. We also purchased a matching cooler that attaches to the back and that has come in handy.All in all, if the only reason for the purchase is for a Disney trip, I would pass. However, for general use, its a winner."
153670,1,"This item arrived as described, but I was surprised at how thin the fabric is. Since the photo is not taken in direct sunlight, it makes the fabric seem higher quality. The item still works well for my application, but if you are looking for a heavier or richer looking fabric, this might not be your best choice."
90161,1,"I don't remember the Baby Dry being like this before, but they feel like that dry max stuff. It feels like she's soaking wet and squishy after the tiniest bit of urine hits the diaper. I much prefer the other high cost brand that doesn't cost as much!"
179784,1,"When we used the this travelmate first time, my husband unscrewed the carseat from the travel mate in the airplane seat. One screw fell off under the seat and we could not find it. At the end of the flight, we found it. In the last international flight, since my child is big enough not using the carseat in the plane, we checked in the travelmate with carseat on it on the gate. When we got it again, one travelmate's screw was ripped off with a piece from the plastic plate. The travelmate cannot be used anymore. We like the travelmate since it really convenient not to carry our child around in the airport during a long international flight and we can ""tie"" him on the seat when we are checking the luggage it."
145363,1,"This is an awesome product, it does an excellent job in keeping little ones entertained. Item received promptly and exactly as pictured/described. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thank you so much! =)"
5225,1,"ITEM CAME JUST AS PICTURED, FAST SHIPPING AND GREAT QUALITY! LOOKS GREAT ON MY DAUGHTER'S DOOR...WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING TO FIND A GREAT QUALITY LETTERS FOR A GREAT PRICE!"
95055,2,"At first I loved this new pump -- it seemed to work much better and more efficient than my really old hand-me-down pump in style. However, that being said, it has been only a few weeks and it feels like it is harder and harder to get milk out.Also, more importantly, milk consistently gets sucked up the tubing. I hold the horn/bottle upright and keep the motor/pump higher than the bottle but for whatever reason my milk refuses to go down the correct passageway to the bottle. The horn is incredibly annoying since (unlike the older version) you can't even see what the heck is in there (parts are yellow plastic). I don't know if I have a bad horn or if I'm doing something wrong (I have NEVER had this problem with my pump in style).I'm sad that I dropped about 150 on this and it isn't all that great. I wish the baby market were a bit more reasonable...."
178072,2,"My kids are Winnie the Pooh fans so I thought I'd surprise them with these mats. What a waste of money. The mats are as thin as a plastic garbage bag and the feet of a chair cause them to tear. Also, if you wipe them off with any elbow grease (to get off dried food) the image rubs off also. I currently use a vinyl tablecloth from Wal-Mart I paid $3 for and it works a million times better. The only plus was the seller shipped as promised."
80253,1,"We purchased the Zooper Ska to use with our Graco Safeseat in lieu of a travel system. We have not been disappointed. The fashionable mom in me loves the funky colors (even though I know that shouldn't be a selling point in a stroller.) The other pros are the super light frame that is easy for me to pull in and out of the car. The spacious basket, excellent rain/sun shade, and the storage components. The cup holder and incidental mesh bag are great places to stash a drink and car keys and the understorage basket fits plenty of extra gear. I found it extremely easy to fold and unfold after I did it a couple of times. It's a sturdy little stroller. The only reason that I give it four stars is that it is only average for long walks outside. I take my daughter on 2-3 mile walks daily and I would prefer something with sturdier wheels for the sidewalk. But since it isn't classified for heavy road use, I wouldn't expect it to perform exceptionally in this area. Still, it has held up well for all of the activity in the past five months and we will continue to use it for regular outings even after we upgrade to a jogger for the longer jaunts. One final bonus: Zooper's customer service is excellent. Ours arrived without a car seat adapter strap and we received it within a week."
6269,2,"I swear by a video monitor and can't live without one, but I have now replaced this one three times in 6 months! The monitor, not just the infrared, the actual screen, just completely stopped working TWICE. When it works, it is great, but for $150 it should last more that 2 months!"
125907,1,"Best diapers out there.I have tried pampers, and even different huggies. They all were so thin and when they got wet, they got soaked! I find with these, the diaper still feels dry after a few hours. Sometimes I have to check really close to see if my son has actually wet yet.LOVE!"
93878,1,"I have 6 of these gates. I have 3 very wide openings in my house that lead to places my daughter should not be. It recomends not to put 2 side-by-side, but i tried this anyway. If you tighten them enough, its just like 1 really big gate. At first, i was using them in a single doorway in our old apartment, to keep my daughter from the kitchen. There, they were not very sturdy at first. But i found that if you tighten them as much as you can without breaking the cabinet walls, then its quite sturdy. Theyre pretty good, but they take some effort to work with. I also would like if i didnt have to step over them."
69889,1,I really loved this item it is priced reasoably and works well. Did not leak even at maximum wetness.Great for the price
57388,1,"I bought this in the mocha color as I loved the non-babyish look and all of the features. However I haven't used this as nearly as much as I thought and don't think I got my $$ worth out of it.The bassinet has overall been great. I love that it can stand alone and you can set it so that it stands on wheels or rocks back and forth. This fit perfectly in my bedroom (I didn't have a lot of extra space, and in fact had to roll it out of the way to open my closet, so I had to keep the wheels engaged) and it was very convenient and wonderful to have my newborn son sleep in my room the first 3 months. (When they wake up every 2 hours, every step you have to take counts!) The storage basket underneath is wonderfully large - you can fit all the baby linens, diapers, etc. you would ever need for your overnight adventure with your precious new bundle of joy.The bassinet has been easy enough to travel with - but for short trips I didn't take the pedestal because while it is easy to assemble it is rather difficult to take apart.My complaints about the bassinet: you can't order any extra fitted sheets, and the bassinet pad is not a standard size. This drove me crazy at first. I called customer service several times about it and they were useless. They were barely professional when they answered the phone, it was like calling someone's grandmother. I almost ordered custom size sheets from some internet web site for like $40. Finally I just wrapped a pillow case and pinned the corner when I needed to wash the fitted sheet it came with. I was paranoid about SIDS and how the sheets aren't supposed to have wrinkles, but they wrap blankets around the bassinet pads in the hospital and $40 is a lot for a silly bassinet sheet.About the play yard: way too difficult to set up. Instructions were terrible and it took us a while to set it up the first time. It is not intuitive to set up or take down or pack it back in the bag. It is also too heavy really to take along for travel. My husband has refused to carry it on any trip we go on. He hates the darned thing. We just shove our son in the bed with us or use whatever crib/ cot is at the place we are going to when we travel. The result is I think I've used the play yard only a half a dozen times. Having a second crib has been handy for when young kids/ babies have stayed over our house, but that's about it.Although I've barely used the play yard I noticed that the extra pockets you can attach to the side (presumably for diapers, etc.) is on the opposite side that you can attach the diaper changing tray to. To me this makes no sense. What a stupid design flaw that should not have occurred. Also I haven't been able to use the music box/ vibrator at all since it is permanently attached to the play yard. It seems that you should be able to stick it on the bassinet somehow, after all those types of things are most valuable for very young babies. Poor design!"
91947,1,"Pillows are unique for everyone (even the kind that you put under your head, right?!) During my first pregnancy (I'm now 8 months into my third pregnancy) I found this pillow at Babies R Us. I love that it's not as hard as some of the pillows (it has some give) and I like that! When the pain is so bad that I need to lay down for 5 or 10 minutes and at night I use it between my knees and it relieves the back, hip, and other lovely pains that I have. It's not one that I like under my belly, but then again, I don't like anything under my belly when I'm on my side. That said I could not be without this! I have have used it three pregnancies and after to feed my baby with and to lay him on. I love it, but if you're looking for a hard stuffed pillow (like the regular Boppy that I don't like) this is NOT the pillow for you! :)"
138697,1,"The beautiful glow from this cute ladybug nightlight really attracted my 2-year old granddaughter. Her 4-year old cousin has the turtle, and she loved the colored lights displayed on the ceiling. Her favorite part of the constellations is the moon. I'm sure she will enjoy this ladybug nightlight for years to come as she learns about the night sky. Well made, too."
106919,1,The Diaper Champ worked absolutely perfectly for the first several months. When my son hit 6 or 7 months the odor took over his room. The company has been great about trying to help us - they send free gaskets as the old ones come off - and they have even offered to send us a new lid since the new gaskets haven't helped. From my experience this diaper pail is about as good as it gets - but after a while it's no longer perfect.
4935,1,These diapers are awesome. They don't leak very often and fit the baby very well. They are a great deal too - compared to the outrageous prices in the stores.

77479,0,"We got this for our baby girl and first started using it when she was 3 1/2 weeks. She loved it then..in fact it encouraged her first coos as she tried to talk to the butterflies and still loves it now at 9 weeks.I have only given it three stars as I have to agree with some of the points made by other reviewers.1. It makes a loud creaking/grinding noise as it swings2. Even on the lowest setting the swinging is much too vigorous for a newborn...I put it one for a few swings then turn it off.For my child, it is stimulating so I cant use it as a sleep aid.because as soon as I put her in it..she is looking for the lights and butterflies whether we put them on or not.While the colors are quite cutesy and sweet for a girl..(pale pink & green)..I wonder how long it will keep her entertained as she grows. If I had seen it in the shop, I would have gone for a more colorful model myself."
4014,2,"I bought this produce for the same reasons many other costumers provided here. It is cute, portable and easy to clean. And it is all that, but I have had it for only 2-3 months and is already broken. One of the buckles broke early on during transport or use, not sure. And then the cloth material started stretching until the baby's butt was resting in the chair (the base chair, or the floor if the chair was put in the floor). No more booster chair any more. I had to put a few fillers underneath so it still works as a booster, but now is not portable any more."
24751,1,"My husband and I had heard good things about this gate, and decided to use them when our little one arrives. We bought 2 of them now (I'm 6 months pg) and set them up so we could restrict our dog (a big yellow lab) to certain areas of the house while we are out. (That, and separate the dog from the kids when our friends come over.)The gate was very easy to install - except in the circumstance where the bottom of the doorway had baseboard molding that made the opening less than 34&quot;, and the top of the gate had to be in a space of 35.5&quot;. So the top of the gate required the extension panel but the bottom did not. Once we figured out how to deal with that, it was easy. We did love that you can adjust the top &amp; bottom pressure mounting separately to account for baseboards. We have it cranked in pretty tight, moved it from one doorway to the other after discovering some traffic issues, and it didn't hurt the walls a bit.The manufacturer has redesigned the foot pedal that so many people had trouble with. This gate is easier for me to open than my friend's older one of the same model (bigger, sturdier pedal), but I still can't imagine a kid being able to open it up. We love it, the dog hasn't been able to hurt it, and you can actually leave it open if you want it open.The only downfall is that you can't get this gate for larger spaces (over 44&quot;) and that you can't use it in a doorway with a door, because of the foot pedal."
179832,0,works great as a stroller when you have to travel with car seat.Kind of a pain to unscrew from car seat but wheels come off really easy
76233,1,"I got my storage trays with the baby food kit and I liked them so much I bought more on Amazon so that I have a total of 4 of them. They make it super easy to make 1 oz portions of food for your baby. The individual cubes are the perfect size for beginner eaters (just needing a small amount), or for making mixtures later (I can grab 1oz of sweet potato, 1 oz of apple sauce, etc). The lids fit tightly, keeping air out. The instructions say to freeze for 8 hours of overnight, then transfer to another storage method for long-term storage (I use freezer bags). Since they are not meant for long-term storage, you may notice some ice crystals on the inside of the green lid if you accidentally forget and leave them in there for a few days. (Not that moms ever forget anything!) But there's no harm to the food in my experience.If you're like me, you're thinking, ""I'll just get some $1 ice cube trays from the grocery and use those instead."" Tried that. I covered them in both plastic wrap and foil and I could not get as good of a seal as the green lids, even with rubber bands holding it in place. Plus then I couldn't stack them very well (I like to make many trays worth at once and I don't have a lot of freezer space). Not to mention all the wasted plastic wrap and foil! That really cut my savings down with all that waste.I do want to add that I made carrots in them and they left a bit of an orange tint in the tray. I've seen no long-term problems with that and I've just decided to make that one my carrot and sweet potato tray. But I wouldn't hesitate to use it for any other foods.Overall, I love this product, I'm so glad I have 4 of them, and I'm planning to get some for my sister to try with her new baby this summer!"
182116,1,"I like these, I think they work good, but I noticed that it depended on the wipe how well they work. Whenever I use Huggie wipes they dry out and the warmer doesn't work as well. The Huggie wipes absorb all of the moisture, I literally could wring them out and use the water to wet the pad again they soaked up that much and that was with only 5 wipes. I have found that with the Walmart Parents Choice wipes that I did not encounter this problem."
55368,2,I think this is a waste of money. Not very useful. There are better ones out there.
18597,1,"THIS RUG IS NICE AND COLORFUL IT LOOKS GREAT IN BOYS ROOM,THE MATERIAL IS THICK ITS A GREAT BUY."
12951,2,"These are not made like they used to be. The wood is thin, cheap grade, and frail. My wife tried to put it up when our grandson came to visit and it snapped on the very first try. Save your money and spread the word. Perhaps the company will learn they can't continue to sell inferior products to the people. Had to give it a one star because there are no negative stars. TRASH that will prevent me from purchasing any other Evenflo product unless I see it first hand so I can assess the quality or lack thereof. Amazon made the return simple so a hearty thanks for their help."
108196,2,"I tried the Avent manual pump after my Medela finally wore out from much use over the last several months. There is no comparison, as far as I'm concerned. The Medela Harmony pump has very few parts, so it's VERY easy to clean and a breeze to put together, and I expressed more milk with Medela as well. The Avent pump leaked because milk would get caught under the silicone shield, and it squeaked EVERY time I pressed the handle. And the real kicker is that when I called their ""Customer Care"" department to discuss my dissatisfaction with the product, I was told Philips doesn't guarantee their Personal Care line. I'm going back to Medela as fast as my two hands can order one on Amazon! I'd previously read how helpful Medela's Customer Service department was and didn't realize it might ever become necessary, as I've come to expect that from most companies...obviously Philips doesn't subscribe to the same viewpoint, so I'm going back to a company with real ""Customer Care""."
148962,2,"I put off purchasing this pillow, since it's on the expensive side. I had a lot of back pain at night, starting around my 5th month of pregnancy. When I finally gave in, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I just could not get comfortable with this pillow. It's huge, but we have a king-size bed, so that wasn't really a problem. It felt comfortable for the first 10 or 15 minutes, but then I started to feel claustrophobic in it. It's very difficult to move once you're positioned in it. It's also very difficult to get in and out of it for those VERY frequent trips to the bathroom. It comes with a cover, which is a nice feature; however, the cover is nearly impossible to get on and off. In the end, I wished I'd purchased something smaller and less expensive."
122899,1,"I must admit that in the past I haven't had the best luck with products containing ""miracle"" in their name. However, this blanket is the shining exception!Our son was a very big boy -- 10 lb, 6 oz of joy. We had read Harvey Karp's ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" (highly recommended) and we knew we wanted to swaddle him. We had planned to use a receiving blanket, but we quickly found out that none of them were remotely big enough. Not even close. We spent a ton of money buying bigger blankets, and we tried two other expensive swaddling blankets as well. Nothing worked, nothing held the baby, and all three of us were desperate to get some sleep. We even bought a cheap sheet set and tore it up to get some bigger patches of cloth. No dice.Finally, I ordered this blanket online (Amazon didn't carry it at the time, alas.) BINGO -- our son slept through the night at once! Yes! We had to wake him from a sound, swaddled sleep to change and feed him; he went back down like a rock as soon as we re-swaddled him. He loved this blanket. When he saw us coming with it, he'd try to lie quietly with his arms in his sides in anticipation of the (very simple) process of swaddling him up. And I loved the fact that this blanket was so soft and comforting and had no snaps or any other fasteners that could rub him.I should mention that the two new parents I gave this to as a shower gift were pathetically grateful, and couldn't stop gushing. I understand; for a new parent, anything that grants you sleep is your favorite thing in the world.A note to parents considering this blanket: Be prepared for some of your friends (especially the childless ones) to recoil in horror at the thought of swaddling. ""You're tying your baby up?"" ""What if he suffocates?"" ""But he won't be able to move! It's cruel!"", etc., etc. These people probably mean well, but their comments are very ignorant. The fact is, your baby has just spent months in the most confined space imaginable -- a womb where he could barely budge at all. And new parents will immediately notice that newborn babies have virtually no control over their newly freed arms -- they'll startle themselves from sleep time and again, then start flailing their hands around and scratching their faces raw. Newborns don't have the neurological control to stop themselves from flailing, so they love it when you return them to the safe, warm, familiar confinement they remember from the womb.Another comment you'll hear from some people is, ""How do you know when the baby doesn't need to be swaddled any more?"" Easy. They start to wriggle out of the swaddling. They may not be able to talk, but they'll let you know clearly when they're ready to move on."
174257,1,"The pad fits the mattress perfectly now on 3"" firm Dream on Me Mattress used in a Graco Pack and Play. It makes the firm mattress have a softer feel. The problem is now a sheet won't fit over the pad and the mattress."
638,1,We can only use Pampers on my son because the others leak. These diapers are great!! They hold up all night long and he never wakes up with leaks!
110441,1,I used these locks for each of my children and thoroughly enjoyed them. They definitely keep the kids out of hazardous places and they aren't too frustrating to open yourself! They had my son baffled until about 4-5 yrs.!
92686,2,This product needs longer tabs so they fit closets with a deeper space between the doors.I agree with most reviewers who stated the item pops off the door. I finally had my husband put 2 screws through the plastic and through the door. Not sure if it will hold as the door is thin.They need to find a much better mounting system.I bought this product to keep an Alzheimer's Patient out of the closet.
24245,2,Just received my mini co-sleeper sheet. Will return it. I did not notice but it's 65% polyester. I myself would never choose to sleep on a poly sheet. Why should my baby? Hardly anything could be better than cotton for a baby's sheet!.
170549,1,"Well after doing much research, and listening to the ladies on my messageboard talk great about this seat...I decided to give this a try. Before i bought this product, I went to BRU and actually tried the demonstration models out in our vehicle to see if they fit properly. I recommend doing this with any seat. We had to raise the headrest in our Windstar to get this seat to fit forward facing, but my son is rearfacing, and he will be rearfacing until he reaches the max wieght for his safety. OMG--this seat is sooo soo comfortable. I love the adjuster on it, and the neck cushions. Obviously the Cow-Mooflage pattern is FUN and everyone gets a kick out of it:) I cant say enough about this. My son is a petite lil guy(he's 15months now) and I'm assuming this seat will be used until the expiration date.(6years). I cant say enough about buying it through amazon. Great service, I got it cheaper w/coupon code and free shipping, no tax, and It came with 5 days of ordering.. Wow thats fast. I highly recommend this seat, and recommend buying from amazon. Oh, it is easy to install, but I highly recommend taking to your local certified car seat inspector for installation."
137483,1,"I bought to of the lady bug night lights, a pink and green one. My daughter and neice LOVE it. They wont go to sleep without it. I love that it turns off after 25 or 45 mins (can't remember how long) because the battery will last longer that way. The stars really do show and comes in different colors, red, green, and blue. I recommend this product."
152913,0,i like the bottle warmer but when i try using it after few use. the water inside the pouch froze by it self. i hope i can returne the item.
172160,1,"I love this tub! I only used the newborn sling a few times, but it sure came in handy in the beginning. My son is five months old now and this tub is almost perfect! He wiggles a lot and sometimes slides down so I have to keep propping him back up but I suppose the tub isn't to blame for that. I think if it had something grippy on the hump in the center then maybe he couldn't slide so easily. The tub is great though and in comparison to other tubs it's actually much safer for baby."
32231,1,"The construction is solid. With pits from fruits, you will need to manually pick them out as you go along, which is true for all mills. No negatives that I can think of."
149881,1,"This product was great for the long trips this summer. My kids wanted it off of their laps after an hour or so, but not because the product was bothersome. They are just ancy kids in general! They liked being able to put their cups in the pockets on the side, and I liked how it kept their toys in one place (not on the floor) while they were playing. With the clasp releases on both sides, I was able to reach back from the front seat and snap off my toddler's tray when she was tired of it. It's a quality product that will accompany us on all of our trips."
108470,1,"Great little seat. The old seat we had would move around on the toilet but this one has a rubber grip on the bottom side with helps ensure it doesn't slide. Also, it has a high pee guard so little boys keep the pee in the toilet and not on the floor."
89952,1,"I love the Pampers Baby Dry diapers. My daughter has never had any leaks or diaper rash using them. I bought the economy pack thinking they'd last a while. But at three months old and 11 1/2 pounds, I'm finding that the straps barely fit and that the leg holes are digging into her skin. I'm going to have to give them to my sister-in-law's newborn so they won't go to waste."
55216,1,"As soon as the potty stool arrived, it didn't take a week an my son was going to the restroom so confident. We were getting frustrated but with the potty stool, potty training has been a lot easier."
177889,0,"I bought one of these sippy cups for my toddler daughter, happy to have a healthy alternative to plastic sippy cups. The leak-proof feature was a must-have. Unfortunately after taking the lid apart to clean it thoroughly, the valve mechanism would not stay in place when I put it back together. If it was not intended to come out then I wonder why it was made like that.We rarely use it now and I am disappointed to have spent the money on it. When my daughter gets old enough to drink without spilling, I am sure we will use it more. I do like how it keeps her drinks fresher for longer periods of time."
172393,0,much better han the bath seat cause this one doesnt have suction it has something that hookes on the side but its still hard to clean baby
45985,1,"My son is fascinated with this mobile. He smiles and coos as he stares up at the pictures. I love that you can change out the pictures to keep it fresh and new for the baby. My only complaint is that the cards are a little hard to change out, and some of the cards can't be moved down so the baby can see them. I wish all the cards had the middle slot to put them in the baby's eye line. Overall, though, this is a great mobile and I would reccomend it to anyone."
3661,0,"I loved this cup at first but my teething son loved chewing on it and the rubber wasn't durable enough so he wound up choking on a piece of the spout. Babies teethe, and a sippy cup needs to be durable enough to withstand the ""comfort chewing"" without falling apart and causing a danger to the child. If your child isn't a chewer though then I'm sure it's a very good cup."
126787,2,"I have a 2 yr old and an 8mo. old, so I know how hard it is to get out of the house to buy diapers (or anything else). I bought these in a pinch, but you can get a much better price at Sam's."
46038,0,"I like that this mobile is not over-stimulating like most mobiles. My daughter really enjoyed it from about one month old to four months old at which time she became disinterested.A major drawback for me is that it is very difficult to change the images. It takes time, effort, and sore hands to interchange the pictures.Overall, I would still probably prefer this mobile to more traditional mobiles that have loud music and less stimulating objects to look at, like small stuffed animals."
142168,1,A definite must-have for moms! Especially those in need of extra hands. It provides excellent lumbar support and baby rides so comfortably. The straps easily adjust to accomodate your growing baby. My son has used this carrier since birth (now 6 months ) and it has been a saving grace. I would highly recommned this carrier because of its superior quality and ease of use.
164519,2,"I had been a fan of Pamers brand since my baby was a just a day older. I loved pamper's Cruiser but Baby Dry no longer keeps the baby dry. It gets saturated very quickly and sometimes leaks. With Pamper's Baby Dry diapers, you will have to change diapers very frequently (on an average every 3 to 4 hours) as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. It is cheaper for more diapers and I thought it was a good deal but you get what you paid for. I don't understand why so good quality name Pamper brand started producing so poor quality product. I am no longer ordering this product."
16390,1,"The blanket is sturdy, easy to wipe, and is designed to fold into a portable form exactly how an outdoor blanket should. Perfect for picnics and everyday walks to the park with the little ones."
78383,2,"I found the tray on this booster very difficult to get off. You have to push it in first and then up, and I nearly hit the baby in the face when pushing it in because it can't be done easily. After only a couple uses, one of the latches that secures the tray to the chair broke off. I returned it immediately and bought the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster, which I absolutely love."
103535,2,"I purchased this step stool along with the ""Munchkin folding stepstool"". I thought this one would be good because of the adjustable height. The stool arrives set at the lowest setting, and to make it higher, you rotate the top 180 degrees. An intersting design! However be warned... the top is somewhat rounded, and if your child steps near the edges the stool will topple and they may fall. This is worse on the HIGHER height.In comparing the two types of stools, the munchkin folding step stool seems much studier (has not tipped yet). Though I am dissapointed in the height of that one.If you are purchasing this simply as a BATH SEAT then it might serve your purpose well.. but as a step stool, there are better options out there... that you can ALSO sit on by the bath!Hope this helps!"
77209,1,Our son loves it. He sleeps like a charm whenever placed in it. The cover detaches for easy cleaning. Set up was easy. The music isn't extremely annoying and shuts off automatically after a few minutes while the swing will continue to rock sleeping baby.
61256,1,"My son is six months old and completely breastfed, so we haven't had smelly poops to deal with yet. However, here are some tricks we figured out:1.) As other reviewers state, the first few diapers do tend to clump together in one ""sausage"" section. Combat this not emptying the Genie as soon as the old sausage is cut. When the Genie is full, cut off your diaper sausage, tie it off, then push it past the clips, and LEAVE IT THERE. The first few diapers of the next sausage will go in much easier, and will be separated properly. When you're a few diapers into you next sausage, THEN empty the old sausage.2.) Personally, I think tying knots to begin and end a sausage is a waste of the plastic refill. My husband and I just save the twist-ties off bread and use them to tie off each end of the sausage. This saves the plastic, which saves money.3.) Don't put wets in the Genie. We keep a plastic grocery sack tied onto the changing table to put wets into. They don't smell, so therefore, they don't need the odor protection of the Genie. We only put poopy diapers in the Genie. This saves money, because you won't be using as much of the refill.4.) The refills are expensive, but [retail stores] (The brick and mortar locations) ALWAYS have them on sale, and very often have coupons in their weekly circulars good for 1 free refill if you buy 3 others. Take advantage, and stock up!We've been very happy with our Diaper Genie, and will continue to use it."
44554,0,"When I purchased the diapers I thought Amazon always had decent prices and at a minimum would be the same as the store and hopefully cheaper. Unfortunately I found out that I paid a lot more for these diapers than I would have at any store near me.Oh well, lesson learned."
49910,0,"I bought this thinking that it was a bath RUG for the outside of the bathtub (which I call a bath mat, hence my confusion). It's cute so I kept it and put it inside the bathtub even though my tub has built in non-slip. Though, that built-in texture keeps this mat from sticking well to the bottom. I imagine it would stick well on a slick bottom bathtub and accomplish its purpose. It's very cute though and my kids think it's fun."
60556,1,"My husband and I love this tub. It is definitely a must have! Our daughter is two months old and a wiggle worm in the bath, but we don't have to worry about her sliding around in this tub. Although it is a little bulky, she has plenty of room to swing her arms and kick her legs. The best part is that you have two free hands to bath your baby with because the tub supports them on its own. I highly recomend the EuroBath!"
19722,1,"1) For the convenience of night time feedings, this is indispensable. If i had to run downstairs to the kitchen, I'd probably be an irritable mommy during the day.I use this both night & day and don't mind relocating it 'cause the 2 min up/down the stairs is worth not having to boil water for each feeding.2) If you are a Dr Brown's user like me, you'll need to remove the cap and the tube before heating. After several episodes of boiling 'n bubbling formula (not a pleasant smell), we had to resort to removing the tube each time. Also, if the formula bubbles over, you end up overheating the bottle!!I don't have any experience with any other bottle warmers.Have also warmed breast milk in plastic bottles and it's a breeze.3) The cooler is a nice amenity but it doesn't fit (height-wise) my 8 oz Dr Brown bottles - the 4 oz and the 8 oz wide mouth is ok though.In fact, if they have this warmer without the cooler, you can just use your own little soft cooler with blue ice packs. The latter option will keep your bottles cold too."
154877,1,"We called this the baby straight jacket! It helped my son sleep through the night from 3 months old! It seemed complicated at first and that the baby would wake up if you tried to swaddle him in this when asleep, but after a few nights it was easy and my baby knew the routine. This is a must product if swaddling is for you and your baby. Especially for babies that break out of other swaddles or are very fussy."
165859,1,"Usually this is a great cost value for the amount of diapers you get but only if you do Amazon Mom Subscribe and Save. My complaint is with their computer system, I went through the whole thing, clicked the button for Subscribe and Save and even checked out with the low cost. But when it came up on my Credit Card Statement it showed it hadn't gone through and I ended up paying more. I called their customer service and they did nothing about it and could not even refund me the little bit of money. They said to me that they showed no where did I do the Subscribe and Save discount but for some weird reason told me there was another type of discount on there that I did not know about and said I got that instead but it still cost more than what I was expecting with Amazon Mom Subscribe and Save. So basically make sure you click all the right buttons online and check right away to make sure you get the Amazon Mom discount and try to get your money refunded right away online because their is no way you'll get it through their crappy customer service that you have to even give them your phone number so that they'll call you through their rediculous SECRET CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER."
109001,1,Excellent stroller for the stand and ride option. Fanstastic for ride and storage option also. Well built. You will not have to worry about this breaking. Easy to collapse and store. Best stand and ride out there.
41153,1,I love these diapers over any other disposable. They are very absorbent and the Cruisers allow my baby to crawl around with ease.
158445,1,"These are a great alternative to buying wall art in frames! They are economical, look great, easy to put up and peel off to reposition (which I had to do quite a bit until I got them where I wanted them, and also had my 4 year old son helping me, he put them where he wanted them). I have not had a problem with them peeling or falling off. I have had them up for 3 days now, and I went to reposition one, and they were still stuck on pretty good, came off no problem, repositioned and stayed stuck on the wall. I bought another package of the little bit bigger stickers because I want to put them on the other 2 walls."
102733,1,Quick release strap makes attaching and detaching the Travelmate to a carseat relatively easy.Wheels can be removed easily if necessary.Provides a comfortable and safe place for baby/toddler to sit while at a gate in the airport.Retractable handle extends to many different lengths.Wheels roll smoothly and seem durable.I have been very pleased with this product!
30886,1,This seat is absolutely awesome! My best friend bought one and it's pretty easy to switch from car seat to stroller. One thing I did notice is that the stroller bar that comes out from the back of the seat only goes so far. So this is only ideal for those 5'4&quot; and under. Taller folks may have a tough time pushing this stroller around.
75090,1,LOVE LOVE LOVE this bag!! I was looking for something roomy and I could fit mine & my sons stuff in... this bang is perfect. It's not floppy and it's got just enough pockets to keep it organized.
81467,2,Are you kidding me? These are nothing special just a little plain pouch you could literally sow yourself. Plus it has velcro so stuff can get inside it is not very sealed and you want diapers to remain a little sanitary at least I do. Any cosmetic case that size such as Ju Ju Be Be quick for less money has more function such as pockets and wristlet ect. This is nothing. I seriously can't believe people buy these for that much. I would not recommend it for this price.
160754,1,"I have 3 of these sheets and always have 1 in the car. They were great for thos late night accidents when you are so tired, just the idea of changing the crib is exhausting. Not only do I use them in my son's crib, I also bring them over other people's homes. Then if I want to put my son on the floor to play, he has something nice and soft to lay on (and god forbid you have an accident in a home without kids!!!). They washed very well and I have recommended them to all my friend."
38118,1,"I purchased this stroller specifically b/c we were going to Disney World with 4 children, and we needed a stroller that was comfortable for my 9 month old and 2 yr old that was lightweight enough to go on the tram cars from the Disney parking lot. This stroller was perfect for that. My husband says I should start my own stroller store, I have tried so many different ones. This did the job needed. A few things that would make it better: snack trays instead of just the cushioned bar, a way for the pads to stay attached better (they slide down a lot); and even thought the steering was okay, it would be better if both the back and front wheels could swivel (only the front ones do.)Overall, I was very satisfied. With a few improvements, it would be perfect."
60369,1,"This is a great product! The tub is well-designed and comfortably keeps my 5 month-old baby in place while I'm washing him. Our son loves to kick and splash in it.We originally had the Fisher-Price Aquarium Tub, which was great for our newborn - 4 months. After that, it became really uncomfortable for our son."
79931,1,"This really does aid in naturally relieving colds! And the price here is amazing. Not pictured, it comes in a gift tote with a rubber duck as well."
1793,0,"Unlike the ones we got at the hospital and Babies 'R Us, these didn't have the wetness indicator--the yellow line that turns blue when the baby pees--which was a disappointment. I think the Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers size 1 still has it (at least according to the amazon description http://www.amazon.com/Pampers-Swaddlers-Sensitive-Diapers-180-Count/dp/B001651192/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=hpc&qid;=1284753490&sr;=1-1.)Also, it says N fits up to 10 lbs., but as size 1 is for 8lbs-14 lbs, may be better to stock up on those. Our girl is 8lbs and the N size already seems a bit snug on her."
909,1,Baby Dry diapers are much better than Swaddlers. I can't stand the chemical smell of the new Swaddlers (with Dry Max) and didn't want my baby to have to smell it all day. Baby Dry is a good alternative. The adhesive taps are not as secure as Huggies diapers.
79049,0,"This set arrived broken, but I called and they sent a replacement (took much longer for them to ship replacement than original). Cute set of table and chairs."
133190,2,"The Diaper Dekor Plus stinks, literally and figuratively. I had a friend who liked it so I bought one w/o reading reviews... bad move. Well, I still haven't read the reviews, but I am writing this one. IT will be short - this diaper stink containment system DOES NOT WORK. After a few days, the babies room smells like a dirty diaper. The refill does not indicate when it is nearing the end, so when it does, you open the Dekor and all the diapers are falling all over, not nicely contained in a bag, like they should be, ready to be tied off. This product looks great in theory, but in my experience, doesn't work."
133082,2,"Like the other reviewer, I too thought this was great for about a month. Once my infants diapers actually started to smell, The diaper dekor was horrible. There was a constant odor in the room and when you opened the lid, it was even worse. I'm not impressed with the triple sealing lid at all."
118626,0,I rarely use most items in this kit. I use the brush and comb and nail clippers the most. I do not like the nasal bulb at all. Wouldn't buy again.
101600,0,"I bought this based on looks alone, and if looks were the only thing that mattered this would have gotten five stars for how pretty it is. However, it isn't quite as practical as I'd thought, given the amount of bottles, nipples, pacis, pump parts etc. that are always on it. The product is not really big enough to carry that many of these baby essentials, and when they are all piled up on it, the items don't seem to dry all that quickly and/or topple off when I am spinning it to get to the other side. The built-in bottle brush is a nice touch and is definitely convenient, but creates even more of a water puddle in the base after use. I'm keeping it and using it since I already made the investment, but if I had to choose again I'd probably get a less pretty, more practical rack."
62375,1,"As a mother of 7, the youngest being twin 5 mos olds... I believe this product to be one of the best investments for my little ones. Reason being that I no longer have to bundle them all up before going outside in the bad weather. A hat is all that is needed, even in the coldest of weather. Cleaning these is also easy. Throw into the washer just like any other laundry.The top unzips and can be taken off entirely.Let's see what else... ease of installing into a carseat is amazing. I have 2 different snowsuits for each of my little ones (getting expensive, and it is next to impossible to fasten them into the seats easily. This works out much better.Last but not least, I also have one of those blanket things that goes over the top of the carseat from one of my older children. Personally I don't like these as cold air gets under it easily and you cannot see the babies face all that well, this product folds down just like a blanket to keep baby snug and warm and easily visible."
128589,2,"I decided to switch off of the Avent bottles out of concern for the BPA in the plastic. I wouldn't say this is the best choice though. Unless you get the cap screwed on just right they leak or don't vent at all. Also, the fast nipples break down quickly (the hole grows larger with each use) and become more like a deluge of milk soaking myself and my daughter. She medium flow is too slow and she gets frustrated. They also are rather heavy and she doesn't like holding it on her own."
147841,0,"Make sure that you measure the highth of your stroller when it is closed up, I didn't and it didn't fit my stroller."
66787,1,"Our friends have this stroller and love it. So we bought it and we love it. It is a little heavy but it is quality. As I said, Well worth the money."
31871,1,"I know the thing has the dimensions, and of course it's going to be small if it holds a 2X3 frame. Even though I see dimensions I can't see that in my head before it arrives, this thing is so itty bitty. Maybe great for a cramped desk space, other than that it is REALLY nice, and super cute!"
161906,2,"I had a few problems with this tub. First the space on the bottom center that allows tub to expand is not only uncomfortable for baby, but also dangerous and can catch babys skin. My tub also leaked, I think through the same space. And the suction cups on the bottom make it VERY hard to remove from any surface."
97663,1,"My son is 18 months old 36"" tall and 33lbs. All other potties were absolutely too small for my son, he dwarfed all seats but this one. We love it so far!!!"
15176,1,"I'm 60 years old and even my oldest grandchild is far past the diaper stage. We have a Diaper Genie II in the garage we use for the disposal of the droppings from our two Shih-Tzus. We used to put them in a trash can after our walks. Now they go into the Diaper Genie and there is never odor. In hot weather using the old system, the garbage can would be rank. My only problem is that I have not been able to find refills for the II at grocery or discount stores around. Baby stores are not usual haunts of mine. Currently I am using a refill for the I. This is working OK but doesn't fit. Still no stink though."
117974,2,They were completely flat outlet caps..No grip handle whatsoever..Very disappointing.. :o(
54398,1,"This is the perfect mobile! My son loves this mobile. I wanted an educational mobile for my baby. And this is it! When babies are born they really can't distinguish light pastel colors or even shapes for that matter. But this mobile has bright and solid colors, just perfect for any baby. It makes them focus on the moving shapes and colors. My son is now four months old and he figured out that he has hands. So he loves to bat the mobile around. This is a very educational mobile and I recommend it to all parents!"
47344,1,"Love the smell and the fact that it's not thick. Time will tell whether or not it works for my baby, but so far so good. Love it and thinking about using it for the entire family."
74830,1,this gate...was a ER buy because my nephew (1 yr old) keep running/craweling away into the kitchen/dining room area... and we have 2 half walls and a opening to the kitchen area and we need something to block this area safely and keep him well protected overall its a good gate! and he has learned that we can't keep chasing him and yet he is mad at his mother and i for putting up this gate to protect him.(he hates being tapped into the family room but its the only safe place for him to play safely)its a good gate but a pain for his granny to climb over!
77807,1,"I have two sons, 2 years old, and 6.5 months old. I received this hippo chair as a gift for my shower, and although I didnt register for it, I am very thankful to own it.My three year old was put in a booster at 12 months old, simply because is highchair was driving us all insane! I knew that I would not go through this with his younger brother, but simply couldn't find ANYTHING that I thought would work.I love this chair because its just so EASY! I really believe that all highchairs should be recalled, and that everyone should own a hook-on-chair, preferably the Hippo. Its just defines the word simplicity. I can hook it onto every single table in my house, that includes the kitchen table, the dining room table, the outdoor table, and even my counter! It has fit on every restaurant table we use as well, even the ones with the single leg, since we just scoot up a chair underneath it. Its SO EASY to keep clean! I just wipe up the pad and its over. I know that the pad can come off, but I honestly find that to be useless, since I see no way that the pad would require laundering. I also love the little hippo clamps. They are cooshie, and save my tables and all other surfaces. The chair does fold, but we dont do this, but simply transport the already lightweight and compact hippo fully assembled, it really doesn't warrant too much space in your trunk at all. I also love that it holds up to 35 lbs... something that I really found impressive.I love the Hippo Hookon, and cannot thank the company enough for salvaging our sanity... It truly is the only solution for parents everywhere!"
79919,0,"It wasn't exactly the baseball I saw on the website. I have another one for my older daughter and the ball is all pink, which is what I wanted. This one is only half pink and half white. It's a small issue I know but I wanted them to be the same and the picture led me to believe they would be. I was disappointed but I guess this one will be just as good...just look at the picture real close to ensure you're getting what you want."
7417,1,"It's a life saver. I love my graco travel system stroller, but the snap n go is simple and light. I use it all the time. Like the other reviews, I'll miss it when my daughter outgrows her infant carrier."
86935,0,"While I love these bottles, I'm very disappointed in the description used. The description states that these bottles are ""decorated"", however they are the clear bottles with just a colored neck."
66117,1,"I found reviews so helpful that I wanted to pass on my experience to others. Dr. Browns bottles are the best. If you want to avoid colic, get Dr. Browns. If your child develops colic, get Dr. Browns. It will shorten then length of colic. I firmly believe it."
17740,0,"I am a mother of a 6-month old, 13 lb baby girl. I bought this stroller after doing three months of research on over 50 strollers. I would read reviews, and bought this stroller based on the advice of others: they had no trouble with hitting the back wheels when they walked. Unfortunately, this was not true for me (5'9"") or my husband (5'10""). I returned it after four days (Amazon has a free returns policy on some items).Positives: The stroller handles VERY well- will turn easily. The handles are so soft and plush- wonderful for gripping. If you are between 5'0"" and 5'5"", it would probably work wonderfully. But if you have long legs, your feet WILL always bump the rear tires, so you can't walk at a ""normal"" gait. If I could I would cut the handles off and lengthen them. The handles to tire relationship is the only negative about the stroller. The seat is very padded, and reclines nicely. It also has a 5-point harness which can become a 3-point harness as the child grows.Be sure to keep the packaging (ALL the packaging) until you are certain you won't want to return it. If it works for you, this is the Best stroller I have found. But I am a picky mother, and I want to enjoy my walks with my little girl, not be always concerned about tripping over my own stroller. So this stroller didn't work for me.Overall, some great qualities, but structurally does not work for tall people, or should I say people with long legs. :)"
83845,1,I have 2 boys - 3 1/2 years and a 21 month old boy. I bought for my younger son and we absolutely love it. In fact we cannot have dinnertime without it. We have used so much in fact - I am getting ready to buy another one. One of the best baby product concepts I have seen. It is refreshing to have a baby product that does in fact does what it promises to do and holds up under heavy usage. We tried the bowls with a suction cup underneath it - this never worked and ended up being a toy.
124873,2,"The monitor works and it is nice to have two receivers, but since it is not 900 mHz like our other one, there is a ton of static on the receiving end. I would recommend making sure it says 900 Mhz."
172603,2,I liked the fact that this tub has a shower and that it grows with our baby. I also liked the sling that comes with it. I placed the tub on top of our dining room table to make it easier on my back. The thing I don't like about it is that it is difficult to operat the shower. It's awkward to press the button on the shower head. Also the shower unit is place inside the tub which takes up space for my baby's legs.
147611,0,"After reading the other reviews I purchesed the 0-6 month hat to match with the bundleme coverup because I had this image of it being so cute, even if only for a little while. There were so many complaints about it being too small I was expecting to have the same issue... wrong. There must be an overall sizing inconsistancy because the hat goes down to my little one's nose so he hasn't been able to wear it yet and he just turned 2 months old. He's not a small baby by any means, he was 8 pounds 7.9 ounces when he was born and now he's over 11 pounds. It is really cute though and I look forward to having him wear it once he grows into it."
179041,0,I also had a problem with the nipple on this bottle. No formula would come out at all. A little hint- Dr. Browns nipple works well with these bottles. They both have a lot of parts to clean but Vent-Aire works better for us.
183564,2,"This item looked like it had already been used when I recieved it I am still waiting for a return label to return it. I have not been very happy at all with this situation. I have been told on 2 different occasion that a label was being sent to me so that I could return this highchair and I still have not recieved it.... please please take care of this for me. The box is ready to be returned and has been since the day I recieved it.Thanks,Joyce Myers"
29328,1,only problem was getting piggy into its pink container after having taken it out to examine it...cute litle item for my newborn great neice...colors great...N.B....reviews should not require 20 words when 3-4 would do...tb
49856,0,"I have a 2 and 4 year old, it served its purpose for the 2 year old but nearly a week after it had been installed my 4 year old had it snapped off. Its plastic and seemed to be durable, but if you have an older child fair warning, its break able!"
159488,1,"Love vibrating bouncy seats! My 1st child slept in one every night until she was 6 months old. She had issues with reflux and was just a terrible sleeper and this seat was the only thing that worked for even an hour or 2. We use this seat a lot with #2 child as well. Lucky for us, she sleeps for 9-11 hours at night in this bouncy seat! The reason I only gave 4 stars is because sometimes you have to bang the unit where the batteries are to make the vibrations start up. Also the toy bar is sometimes difficult to get out of the seat part and you may have to jiggle it to get the music to start when you put it back together. I will say that this seat takes a bunch of abuse because we use it EVERY day."
38055,0,I bought this in a pinch. The comforter is not perfectly rectangular. It is lopsided. The patchwork is crooked. I think I may have gotten a messed up one but I paid just $30 for it so I cant really complain too much.
111350,2,"Those plugs suppose to be relatively easy removable by adults. Easier than ""trivial"" plugs. Practically it is really tough to get them out after they are installed. Barely possible without tools. Fingers hurt. If you don't use the outlet very often buy and use simple plugs. If you do need it often thenHome Safety Universal Outlet Cover in White (Set of 3)work much better."
59678,1,"I bought this tub based on all the reviews I read about it. I purchased it when my son was already a year old because he was getting to big for his smaller tub. My son loves to play in it and I feel that he is safe while bathing. The only drawback to it is that it is enormous. It is hard to store away without taking up too much space. Otherwise, the bath tub does its job and it is easy to clean."
93692,1,"Maybe an Avent product, but it works awesomely with Gerber Gentle Flow!!! No leaks!! & great for formula mixing & storing bottles in a diaper bag :)"
5363,1,I was happy to receive these. I bought 2 packs at a great price and they were here when they said they would be.
178980,1,"I've used all kinds of different bottles over the years from cheap Wal-Mart Specials to Avent and Dr Browns and these bottles are much closer to the higher end than the lower. Here is a break down of what I like and don't like.Pros:-Baby doesn't seem to have much gas after using these.-It is very easy to clean the inside since both the top and the bottom come off.-They are very easy for both me and my baby to hold.Cons:-Since the top and bottom do come off there are 5 pieces to clean for each bottle, so it takes up a lot of room in the dishwasher.-The nipples seem a little faster than most others I've tried, so at first my baby made a big mess when using these because she wasn't used to fast flow.-The nipples and tops are very close looking to the Avent bottles, so sometimes I put the wrong ones on one or the other and they leak.So to summarize, I would get these bottles again and other than perhaps the Avent bottles, since they have less pieces to clean, these are my favorite that I've used."
91909,1,She asked for this on registry becasue her friends who have babies recommended and she uses all the time. Good product
27037,1,"I am 30 weeks pregnant, single, and work 12 hour shifts on my feet as an ER nurse. I had so much pelvic pressure,my days were filled with pain and misery. I was wondering how I was going to keep working. I ABSOLUTELY have to work for another month and a half as there is only me to support me and my baby. I was skeptical because there didn't look like there was much to this belt, but the difference it makes is unbelievable. I can get through my shifts. I can also go for walks with my dog on the beach which I haven't been able to do for months. Most importantly, it has freed me up to relax and enjoy the amazing process of being pregnant, and welcoming my son into this world. If you are looking for pelvic support with some back support...look no further. Also it seems to have decreased some of my bladder pressure. I CAN'T recommend it enough!"
51029,1,"I just got this yesterday and love it. I had a hard time finding an UNcomfortable position. I drifted right off to sleep no problem. I am a belly sleeper and at 6 months, that is not really an option. This pillow helped me get into as much of a belly postition as any prego can get. For leg support it could be a little thicker but I just fold it over at the end. Before I had this, I had 3-4 pillows positioned around me for comfort. Multiple pillows tend to move in your sleep so I would wake up a couple times a night to reposition them. I no longer have to deal with that."
120413,1,"Several of my friends had babies just before I had mine. They all remarked about how they couldn't sleep fearing their babies would be victims of SIDS. So I bought this monitor and have never had such fears. Yes, I have had a few false alarms from her wandering to the edge of the crib... but nothing annoying.We have had one true alarm when she rolled over on her tummy in the night with her pacifier in. Not a single friend teases us about this monitor now! This is a top 10 item on any baby list I give!!! BUY IT!!!"
138569,1,"I ordered this item as a gift for my Granddaughter. I had given her older sister the Twilight Constellation Turtle a year ago. It was such a hit, the younger girl wanted her own. After giving her the Lady Bug, she held it the whole day and slept with it that night. A great gift. Amazon handled the order perfectly and I couldn't have been happier."
3080,0,"I've been wrapping my son with micro fleece swaddle-me for a few months without any problem. He was 5 months old and using the size large. I thought to give this cotton one a try since it is getting warmer. This cotton material is nice and soft and thin. I like the soft feeling of it, but it doesn't work very well to hold my son's limbs tucked in. One morning he woke up with one of his fists out from the top and the other one from the middle opening, and I don't know how he did it but his legs were busted out from the pouch which has never happened with the micro fleece.I have 2 kids and invested in several baby wraps includes highly rated expensive Miracle Wrap, but the micro fleece swaddle-me has worked the best for us."
100359,1,"I get these sent out to my daughter for my grandson, she says it's a good deal, so she gets them delivered every two months!"
182488,1,Very nice & like them just wish they werent so see thru put them on dark colored walls made them look weird.
139425,1,DO NOT tell me how many words I need to use in a review!! DO NOT tell me how many words I need to use in a review!!
129771,1,"In anticipation of our second baby we purchased this transition bed for our toddler (26 mo.). It is a sturdy bed, great construction. The color matches perfectly with previous furniture. After doing a lot of comparison and research we settled on this bed because the reviews were stronger as far as shipping, assembley, parts, and construction. It was no hassel to put together. We are very happy with our choice and our little guy transitioned to his ""big bed"" with no problem. I would highly recommend this product!!"
13234,1,This item is approved by the safety commission! I took this to my local car-seat safety clinic and the instructor was impressed by it's strength and ease of operation! YOU MUST BY THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR CAR SEAT TO WORK! (...) a small price to pay for your childs safety! The local fire-chief bought 10 just to have at the fire station to show parents! This product makes any seat easy to tighten and won't break! It WILL hold your safety seat tight during a crash. Invest in this product! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
126433,2,"I'm pretty upset at Huggies today. I have been using Huggies Little Movers for many months without any trouble. 2 weeks ago we switched to Huggies Snug & Dry. Last night I noticed these blue marks on my daughters thighs and freaked out. They looked just like bruises. Through a quick process of elimination, I realized that it had to be the diapers, as nothing else has changed. I have 2 twin girls and this only happened to one of them. I did some research and there are complaints dating back to 2009, though Huggies says that it's unusual and keeps apologizing to all these mothers who take their kids to the emergency room or the doctor worried to death that something is wrong with their baby. There are hundreds of complaints online and several news stories. Unfortunately, I didn't know about this until after it happened to me. Huggies says the blue ink is safe, but is it really? Do they really know? Why haven't they fixed this issue? So it's okay that my daughter looks like she has some kind of disease or has been abused?I'm done with Huggies. It's too bad because it was my favorite brand and the diapers worked really well, but I'm extremely disappointed with the blue ink issue and will never use Huggies brand again.Fix your diapers Huggies! Parents have enough to worry about!"
164344,1,Best diaper ever - the other leak or our too noisy!! Don't bother trying others!! These are the only ones that don't leak through at night!
155018,1,"I love this bottle, it is so much easier to fill with one hand (all us moms know how important that is)! This should have been available long before now. I have lots of the older Avent disposable bottles, and the liners are a pain in the neck to try to get in and filled(impossible to do with one hand)!LOve this bottle!"
58534,1,We use this for home and travel. Just pop it in the microwave and sterilize. Good item.
150694,2,"This is a great product, but very hard to assemble. It took 3 hours to put it together, and I have a PhD degree. My hands are still hurting from using the screw driver. Too many screws. They should have built considering ease of assembly. They should go check Ikea and see how their furniture is easy to put it together."
19775,1,I purchased the Lambs and Ivy Rock N Roll bedding for my newborn son. These baskets work great with the cherry furniture and the brown and blue bedding! They are good quality...and look great in the room.
59257,2,Save your money. You can heat a bottle faster under hot running tap water or by heating a bowl of water in the microwave and sitting the bottle in it. This bottle warmer is definitly not a necessary item. It is expensive and it takes too long to heat a bottle.
6747,0,"I tried the cruisers on sale when the Pampers Baby Dry were the same $ amount. I was unhappy with the results. It leaked more often than not. I couldn't put him to bed in them. He had several ""blow-outs"" with them. I won't use them ever again. I'll stick with the pampers baby dry or seventh generation."
163440,2,"I was excited to get this high chair, but totally disappointed once it arrived. Its easy to put together, took about 5 minutes total. The first problem was that it didn't scoot under my kitchen table. The biggest issue for me though was the CHEAP FEEL of the whole thing. I know its only 50 bucks or so, but I would have paid maybe $75-$80 if it were better quality. The tray, seat, side rails, and basically the chair as a whole feels wobbly. The tray does not slide on and off easily due to this. The only benefit I could see with this chair is that its lightweight and could be brought to a restaurant, sitters, family members house for feedings. It would ravel well.We went with a full size Chicco. Its worth the extra 70 bucks!"
145885,1,Love it! My second child is enjoying it as much as the first one did. The attachments are tons of fun to play with and explore even when he's done jumping. Durable and worth every penny.
174795,1,"Do you REALLY need a changing pad? No. But, my baby always enjoys laying on this thing when we change her or dress her. I like that it has 4 sides. I ordered minky, soft covers in vibrant colors on etsy to cover the plastic. I've even moved this to the ground to give her a safe place for nakey-time."
31704,0,"I give this a 3 because that foam tip thing falls apart pretty quick. I guess it can last a month or so. Maybe less. I'm not really sure how long a bottle brush should last actually. I haven't done any detailed comparison (yet), but I did order a few other brands just to try out a variety because I wasn't really in love with this one. ""It's OK"" as the 3 star review states."
139448,1,My daughter loves this little turtle. She needs it with her every night at bedtime. The yellow is pretty light on the walls/ceiling but the other colors work great.
56453,0,"We have a gas stove and these do the job, but the issue I have is the plastic melts from heat from the oven. Especially if you use the broiler. My kid is 2, and we have taught him to stay away from the oven, so these are more of a redundant solution (but still important to have). We just buy more when the plastic melts."
139594,0,I guess maybe I expected more...music or movement or something. Still good as a nightlight and it projects very well. I'm just glad I didn't pay more than $25.
128288,1,I purchased this seat for my son and it has worked fairly well for 7.00. I put down a paper seat cover then the potty seat making sure that it is centered well. That is the key to it not collapsing. You also have to put your child on it centered. If you do those two things it is less likely to bend and scoot.I keep it in a zipper bag inside my diaper bag and when I get home I take it outside and Lysol it thoroughly. We have taken it on several trips and outings now and I have had little (just a few slips) trouble. My son is 32 lbs and it's a good match for us.Buyer Beware - it is a little flimsy. I can see the trouble if you are not precise with it.
34426,1,"We switched from Butt Paste to this after finding out the Butt Paste had boric acid in it. This has worked well and is supposed to be less toxic. However, it is very thick and hard to get out of the tube. I end up wasting a lot when I get down to the bottom, and it's hard to control how much comes out at a time. I encourage the manufacturer to release a version in a tub with a screw top lid. Also, the smell gets a bit sickening after being associated with human waste. I would also encourage an unscented version. If not for those two issues, the product would be a 5 star."
3240,1,Excellent product. The only swaddle blanket my kids couldn't escape. Be careful not to over-clothe/wrap infants with any swaddle blanket.
78828,1,"This strap worked like a charm. I was a little nervous to get it but figured I could return if it didn't pass the trial run. I had no problems what so ever! My husband was super skeptical of it working with our giant Britax car seat but boy was he surprised when it worked with no problems. My 22 month old sat in it through both airports up until we loaded the car seat in the plane. It really made our first time traveling with kids a breeze. I totally recommend this product. I recommend a trial run before the day of travel so you can get used to adjusting the tether strap. Once you get it down, it will make it so much easier for your trip."
147039,1,"I am not sure if this one is being made any more. Ours was extremely hard to find and still expensive. However, it was worth it. Our twin girls loved and used it for a long time. I would recommend it to anyone."
2329,2,I got these diapers because I had a coupon. Big mistake. It felt like it took forever for me to get through this one pack of diapers. I almost threw them out completely. They have hardly ANY tabs on the size so they are too tight on my little one. They are also pretty scratchy and not at all soft.I think the best diapers on the market are the swaddlers made by the same company.
31119,1,This stroller is wonderful! It's compact and lightweight. Both babies can fit in it and it works perfectly with the chicco keyfit 30 carseat. Would highly recommend.
14128,0,I breast-fed my daughter for 8 months. I used a Medela pump to express milk and whenever I had to give her a bottle it was one of the Medela storage bottles that she drink from. She never had any problems with nipple confusion. Upon deciding to wean her I talked to many friends about bottles and they all suggested the Avent system. Immediately I noticed the leaking problem! I never knew anything about tightening the cap too much until reading the reviews on this site just today. I will give it a try and see if it helps since I've already invested quite a bit of money in Avent. One good thing is that my daughter is 9 months and will be graduating to the sippy cup soon. The wide mouth on the bottles make it easy to mix formula and clean them but the leaks drive me crazy! If I had these bottles from the begining I'm sure I would have bought others by now. Whoever decided that making the cap so sensitive would be a good idea must not have any children.
5584,2,"Everything in the set is cute. However, when it arrives and you open it, everything is taped together with extremely strong tape. When you try to pull the tape off, it pulls the fabric on everything. Now the towel, bib, washcloth, etc. has little pull marks everywhere the tape was. It is very disappointing. This was a gift from a friend for my newborn and I feel bad she spent good money on such a shoddily put-together product."
159218,2,"My daughter was given this chair as a Christmas gift. We were already using the Kick-and-Play model, but decided to keep the Aquarium chair just in case. It's a nice enough chair, but compared to the kick-and-play, I hated it. First of all, I did not feel that the seat sling is deep enough for a large baby like mine. Secondly, the seat cover partially obscures the hole where the activity bar goes in, and the activity bar has fastener tabs that lock it in place, thus making it a pain to remove and/or insert the bar. With the kick-and-play chair, you could change the bar with one hand..no latches...just clicked in place or pulled out.The music is also very soothing and ""sleepy"" which is great for nap time, but not for everyday activity use. The few times I put her in it (while washing the other chair cover) my daughter would fuss. I would not purchase this chair. If I had been given a gift receipt, I would have taken it back. It does not compare to the kick-and-play model. (Please see my full kick-and-play review also.)"
56823,2,"My daughter is 2 yrs old and in the 75th% for her height and weight. She is by no meats ""fat"". The problem with this seat is that the deflector, meant for boys, is not removable and is way to wide. My daughter looked so uncomfortable sitting in this chair since it digs into her thighs. I would not recommend this seat for girls."
167254,0,We bought this seat in hopes that my son would be able to use it for a long time. It was great while it lasted but he is now two and a half and has out grown it. He is 39 inches and 38 pounds and his legs dangle uncomfortably over the end and his shoulders are too broad for the seat so he has to sit at an angle. It's very disappointing for a car seat that's supposed to hold bigger kids.
174056,1,"This was the best shower gift we received. We had this set up in our living room before we went to the hospital. We used this swing from day one, every day. Our baby just turned seven months old and he still loves to swing in it. I honestly don't know where we would be without this swing. We literally use it every day."
110874,1,I don't know what we would have done without this teether/toothbrush. My daughter loves to chew on it still and we are working on tooth five and six.
181656,1,"I bought this security blanket for my son when he was just about 3 1/2 months and within the first two weeks he got so attached to it, its amazing. When I saw how attached he was I bought another security blanket for him but a different brand. He's now 15 months and he cannot go to sleep without the kiddopotamus one. He has refused to even look at the other one. He hugs his bear, kisses it, drags it on the floor and even uses it to beat everyone and everything. The bear has to be washed and dried while he's awake and be ready for his nap time."
5922,1,"To my surprise, and contrary to other reviews, the extra long screw needed to install this outlet cover was provided. Bonus!The outlet plate installed easily, (one screw) and the sliding outlet covers are strongly sprung to make sure the outlet is immediately covered when its not being used.The cover is about an 1/8"" narrower than a standard outlet cover, so if you are covering flaws with an oversized outlet cover, this product may not be for you.I would recommend this product."
9710,1,"Our first potty for our daughter had one of those squishy foam-type seats. We thought that would be more comfortable, but soon realized it just irritated her bum. It had a huge reservoir, was a pain to dump and clean, and that foam part was always getting dirty and could never be completely cleaned.A friend had a Baby Bjorn, and seemed happy with it, so we gave it a try. My daughter chose her own color - I love that there are so many options - and we ended up with a green one. She loves this potty. It seems comfortable, and she doesn't get that red ring around her bottom from sitting on it. And best of all, it's SO EASY TO CLEAN. The reservoir is compact and can be rinsed in a small bathroom sink, but holds plenty. If you forget to dump it once, it won't overflow on the second use.My first daughter still prefers this potty over using the adult one. She's 3.5, and big for her age. The size of this potty is very versatile, and I think it will last her a good while longer if she needs it to.Now my second daughter is getting to the potty-training age (18 months), and we've invested in a second one in her favorite color, yellow (it's actually a lovely shade). The same potty that can accomodate my preschooler works just as well for my little toddler, and that's a great feature.I have zero complaints about the Bjorn potty. It's absolutely worth the extra money."
140515,0,"I have a big fat baby (20 pounds at 3 months. I know, I know...)Well, he didn't like to be in the swing when he was first born, and by the time he DID like it (a few weeks ago), he was to heavy for it! The swing would go at first, then slow down quickly, then almost stop completely.So we only got a good week or so of it actually semi-working. Also, there was always a faulty wire connectors in the back where we would have to squeeze them together through the fabric.We liked the a/c adaptor option, and I think ALL swings should be able to switch back and forth between plug in and batteries.With all of that said, we're off to return it. Sigh..."
108762,1,I bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it! The plaster works well as it can be redone until you are happy with the results. Left to harden it forms a keepsake that you will always enjoy. I would definitely buy this product again for someone who has just had a baby.
40278,1,Good diapers but can't tell much difference comparing to Baby Dry.
120279,2,"From the time she began to crawl, our daughter could defeat this. She would either pull it out and away from the VCR, or push the buttons through the plastic. (not stable, no way to keep it in place, etc.) We finally broke down and got an entertainment center with doors that we could hide all the electrical equipment in, returned these and bought locks for the cabinet doors."
72914,0,not the best but it did the job. I wish the back and the straps was better madethanks SB
9179,2,"This has got to be one of the worst baby products AND worst CD players I have ever owned. Yes it plays CDs, but that is about it. My main issues are: (1) opening the CD player or the control shield is extremely noisy and difficult; (2) the volume range is nowhere near wide enough (the unit is very quite); (3) the light is useless when the unit is mounted on a crib rail. I would not recommend this product!"
14999,0,"These are best if your baby like sto chug milk. I'm breatfeeding my 2 month old and used avent bottles when i went back to work. She would finish the bottle off in 5 mniutes and had horrible gas. The newborn/slow nipples were much too fast. She is more of a leisure nurser, and was getting horrible gas/spit-ups from gulping the milk so fast. I did like how all the bootle parts (seals/nipples) are interchangable, that's why i gave it 3 stars.I will still use them for milk storage, (...)"
171134,1,Arrived in perfect condition. Same Gund toy previously purchased at Nordstrom. Good deal and loved by all cuddly little boys!
121796,1,My daughter who is majoring in maternal and child care at George Washington U has been a nanny to two mothers and they both highly recommended this for my daughter when she became pregnant. It is great for Dad and breastfeeding momma and continues on as baby ages for other helpful uses. We're very happy with the Bobby Pillow and the Sweet Pea cover is adorable. I'm very happy with this purchases.
30433,1,"All good. My baby loves it. But if I remember correctly, the product description says that it comes with a baby-toy that can measure the water tempretuare, but there wasn't anything like that in the package."
18738,1,"We got this swaddler along with a couple other brands and nothing comes close to how well this works. The dual flaps on each side keep my baby's arms secure and he loves being wrapped up. The fabric is soft and clings well to itself to he can't easily wriggle his way out. I would recommend buying two, just so you have a backup for whenever those accidents occur. I have seen this priced cheaper elsewhere, so shop around, but definitely get this!"
177401,1,"I originally bought the Avent Isis IQ uno electric pump. I ended up only using the manual parts that were included. It worked so well, I took back the electric pump and bought the manual one instead. It is just as fast and easy as an electric and $100 less! I've used the Pump In Style and this is just as effective, especially if you pump on one side while nursing on the other."
43819,1,"We bought this for a trip to Canada to visit relatives. It served our purposes nicely.When we got it, we unpacked it and let it inflate overnight, per instructions. It wasn't quite ""full"", the next day, so I zipped open the compartment that holds the cushion, removed the cushion, and let that inflate, unencumbered, for another 24 hrs, which allowed it to reach its max potential.I was concerned that an ""inflating"" seat could develop a leak and be useless, but the cushion is very sturdy, and the self-inflating foam matrix inside provides a lot of support. I have no doubt it will last for a long time.It strapped very securely to the various chairs we stuck it on. My 17 month daughter didn't seem to be able to topple sideways, (another concern of mine), in spite of the fact that she's a VERY active child.To deflate, I open the valve, kneel on it to force out all the air, close the valve again, and zip it all up. It zips to about 2"" thick, (maybe two and a half....), and packs nicely into our bag for travel. Zippers and velcro keep it nice and small, and it has a small handle for carrying.All in all, we're very glad we bought it, and would recommend it to anyone."
115875,1,"My husband and I got this stroller to replace the inexpensive umbrella stroller that we had for running in and out of stores. This stroller still has all of the benefits of an umbrella stroller, ie. it folds down and doesn't take up much room in our small car, but is much nicer to push and has a place to put a small diaper bag under the seat, our son also finds it to be much more comfortable to ride in. It's nice and sturdy, easy to operate, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice easily portable stroller."
28615,2,"PROS1. Easy to assemble. I just had to put together the arm rests, back rest, and cusions.2. The arm rest cushions. They actually snap on to the seat on the bottom part, keeping things (or baby) from dropping through. Moreover, there are handy little pockets on the outsides of the arm cushions.3. It's cheap and comes with the ottoman.CONS1. The paint on the wood is sparse in some spots and, even worse, had some scratches on the wood itself, up on the top of the back rest. Thankfully, the cushion covers it, and the other paint issues aren't too noticeable since they are toward the bottom of the glider.2. Uncomfortable! When I fall asleep in this, I wake up not being able to feel my arms. Also the chair area is kind of small and makes it so that I have to sit up stiffly with my back straight. I don't usually notice it until I'm getting off the chair and realize that my back is a little sore.3. The arm rest is too short. My baby has the habit of leaning back for a stretch after she is done nursing, and on this glider, her head dropped off the end!04. The cushions are very squeaky, kind of like the hinge of a door that needs to be oiled. The back cushion as well as the seat cushion will make these loud squeaks with any amount of movement. Even after three months of use, they are just as bad and have become more and more annoying. And the sound is loud enough to wake my baby up when I want to leave the room. Terrible!I would definitely rather buy a used Dutailier on Craigslist than buy this again."
47194,1,"My son was 2 when my daughter was born and at a stage where he did not like riding in strollers. We had a Graco travel system when he was born and it was so heavy we hardly used it. So, I was in the market for a double stroller that #1 was light weight, #2 had a universal infant seat attachment so I didn't have to buy a new car seat, #3 my son would actually sit in without screaming to get out, and #4 that would enable me to take 2 small children out alone with the least amount of stress as possible. When I came across sit n stands they seemed to fit the bill. After pouring over all the reviews I decided to spend a little more and get the Joovy Caboose and I'm so glad I did.The only time I had an issue with my Joovy was when we took it to Disneyland and at the end of a long day my son was ready to go to sleep and I had no place to put him (the infant car seat was in the front). We ended up renting another stroller which was fine because I had family with me to push it. The next time we went to Disneyland I brought along the Baby Bjorn carrier to put the baby in so he could use the front seat to relax in if he needed to, but we found that it was too small for him(he was 2 1/2 and average height). His feet dangled over the foot rest and the seat didn't recline enough for him to get comfortable. Still, I'd much rather deal with renting a stroller on the few occasions we go to theme parks rather than always lugging around a heavy double stroller with 2 full seatsPros:-It is light, maneuvers great, folds easy, and is easy to get in and out of the car-My son LOVES riding on the back bench. When the front seat is reclined (or we when were using the infant car seat adapter) he has to lean forward a bit and it looks uncomfortable but it has never bothered him-I love that I have the option of strapping him in the back seat when I'm alone and need him to remain seated but also letting him hop on and off freely at other times. No more breaking my back trying getting him in and out of a stroller at the zoo.-My Graco snugride infant seat fit perfectly-The canopy and parent tray are fabulous-Colors and fabrics are high qualityCons:-The front seat is a little small and the foot rest is narrow.-Front seat doesn't recline back very far for naps-Basket underneath is not easily accessible with a child on the back-My son will sometimes drag his feet while sitting on the back bench but when I tell him to stop he listens (especially if I tell him he'll have to get off)Disneyland trips alone were not enough to convince me to buy another stroller but that coupled with the fact that we live in an area with steep hills and walk our dogs every night is why I recently gave in and purchased a double jogging stroller. The Joovy gets to be a little front heavy when going up and down hills and there is no safety strap if I tripped or fell and it got away from me. I plan to use the jogging stroller for evening walks or all day walking intensive activities, and the Joovy for shorter trips to the mall etc. I figure I still spent less than the cost of most high end strollers and will now have 2 that meet ALL of our needs."
65278,1,This console works great with the Bob... although I think for the price of the stroller they should include it! It does hold my camelback waterbottle and my baby's snacks when we go out just fine.
7554,2,"I was given an Evenflo Discovery Infant Car seat as a gift and was under the impression that it would work with the Snap N Go-- after all, the product claims to be compatible with Evenflo seats. It doesn't work, not only that, the chart that indicates which models are compatible is located near the end of the instruciton manual--AFTER the assembly instructions. So, now I have a fully assembled Snap N Go (I can't return) that won't work with my car seat.My advice? Call the Baby Trend customer service number (800-328-7363) before buying this product to make sure that your car seat will work!"
39336,0,"My baby came out 10lbs so by the 2nd week, his feet came out the blankets and I could no longer swaddle him. So I went back bought the 2- 3 pack 40""x30"" blankets since they were the biggest available. One was Koala blankets which were cheaper than the Carter one. The colors of the Koala blankets were much better than the Carter ones but the Carter blankets were a little bit thicker. Both brand can swaddle my big baby.As for these blankets, well I used them for burp cloth, to cover the car seat etc. They are still useful but the quality isn't as great. After 10 washes in a month, a few blankets are showing signs of falling apart already. Luckily I bought triple amount of blankets that the new born list recommended."
109877,1,"Our baby's bed is a twin size bed but with only one mattress, seems that these rails are made to be put between two mattress (like box) and not in a wood bed, anyway, we cut the piece that allows it to move it and make it firm and permanent, for small babies is fine, now that she is growing up wants to stand and watch over it... thanks God I allready tought her how to get down from the bed in order to take away the idea of jumping the rail.I will recommend it, good quality, nice price/nice product."
12132,1,What a wonderful product! I actually went into Babies R Us to purchase another sleeping product. They were out of that one and this was my second choice. I actually purchased two of them. I can now sleep on my back without problems-I prop my self up on either side with the wedges. I can sleep at night and my husband is sleeping through the night too. I also have round ligament symdrome and have no pain when I use these wedges! This is the best product out there and worth the $9.99!
146272,1,"We purchased this for our (at the time) 3 month old son because he was constantly trying to kick and stand. He loved his walker but needed a little more fun on his feet. The Jumperoo was a HUGE hit the minute we put him in - he laughs and jumps all over the place! The bottom is easy to disassemble and fold to get through doorways.**The reviewer that stated the bottom disassembles itself must have received a faulty product, or did not assemble it correctly...I can find absolutely no way the Jumperoo could come apart without a person pressing the button that releases the section that folds.**The little butterfly toy is a bit ""limp"" on the side, but I have found it helps with his hand-eye coordination, concentration and problem solving skills trying to fish it up the side of the Jumperoo so he can chew on it. The toys are wonderful and keep him amused for a bit so I am able to get some dishes clean etc. He has fun, and Mommy gets some stuff done! The Rainforest Jumperoo is one of the best toys we've gotten so far, and it was the least expensive of all the Jumpers we found!"
21620,0,"This is my first baby, so not much to compare it to...but there are a few annoyances with this carseat. 1. the straps are constantly getting twisted. 2. The handle release buttons are very tight and hard to move back easily to get baby out. 3. the handle doesn't lend itself well to attaching/dangling toys. 4. Wish the canopy was slightly larger to cover baby more efficiently when it's raining or for filtering out sunlight. 5. the adjustibility of the straps is not as easy as it should be.On a more positive note...I like that it's lightweight, easy to carry, easy to snap onto it's base and install base into car, easy to snap onto the snap n go stroller that BabyTrend makes. The upholstery is nice looking and wipes off easily. Many people have remarked they think it looks like a Chicco carseat.But I can't help but wonder if there might be a better carseat out there."
47043,1,We got this stroller when our kids were 1 1/2 and 3 years old. We've used it for about 6 months now. When we need a stroller this thing is great.Pro's:Lighteasy to moveeasy to foldhold two kidslots of storagewas a good price.Con's:none.
109871,1,The good thing about this side rail is that it is great for larger mattresses - ours is 14'' of memory foam and it works fine. The down side is there is quite a bit of a gap between the mattress and the rail.
134273,1,"It's is a very good product. We bought one in April when my daughter was born. We liked it very much, so we bought another one for a friend for the baby shower. It keeps the wipes warm all the time. I only need to clean the sponge and refill the water once a week. Pampers wipes fit the warmer perfectly. I put in one pack each time. Huggies are a little thicker and therefore a little hard to put out. I would highly recommend this product."
46635,1,"O.K. I just have to get this off of my chest after reading some of the other reviews for this product. We have this system and couldn't be happier with it. I have read more than one review claiming that this is a dangerous product, that with just the touch of a button the stroller collapses and baby goes flying. Let me start here, the button to collapse this stroller has a second button which must also be pressed in order for it to collapse, it won't happen on accident, if you try to collapse the stroller with the baby still in it what the $!&* do you think is going to happen? And if you leave the baby unattended in the stroller with other small children around, especially toddlers, and one of them collapses the stroller, well that's just poor parenting and maybe you shouldn't have kids. In conclusion I believe just like every other parent that safety is the first and most important concern when it comes to your children, but folks, a little common sense goes an awful long way in this world and I'm sick of seeing irresponsible parents blame thier own neglegence on product manufacterers. Thank you."
77265,2,we bought this swing thinking that it would be a great for our daughter as a matter of fact it was great for about a week until my daughter weighed around 8 pounds and it was too much for the swing and it just Creeked and squeaked! All I can say is very dissapointed in fisher price I guess they are just not as good as their name used to stand for
59191,2,"Here's what I don't like about this warmer: 1. You can't leave it plugged in, because plugging it in turns on the heater, and there is no on-off switch...I find this inconvenient. 2. Settings 1, 2, and 3 all go up to 160 degrees F...1 just takes a longer time to get there. The warmer doesn't shut off after reaching this temperature, so if you forget about it, the milk will get really hot.This warmer probably makes sense if you don't want to take a trip to the kitchen to heat milk on stove and need to do so in the baby's room."
113068,0,"I had been looking at this shelving unit for quite some time. The design is gorgeous and I love the colors. I finally ordered it from Amazon - it took about two weeks to get to me. There were about 20 wood pieces and a hundred screws and bolts. It took me over two hours to get the shelves together (you need two people) and another hour of extreme frustration to get one of the swinging doors on. The second swinging door was utterly hopeless to screw on straight and I am pretty good at putting stuff together. So, I now have this unit missing a door which is such a drag but it looks okay. Again, the design is very pretty. But the hassle to put it together and the lack of a second working swinging door makes this a RISKY PURCHASE. I'm not sure I'd buy it again in hindsight."
164461,0,"I like this product because it absorbs well. However, the quality of the product is not that consistent. The strap may not be very strong, and the whole thing might just come off, making it not functional. Also, out of the 6 boxes we bought, one smells terrible"
162636,1,"This tub is awesome, and so affordable, I wish that I could say that about every baby product I have ever bought or received. I bathed my daughter in this up until she was about 3 months old, by that point, she had almost outgrown it (she's really long), and I had discovered that she really enjoys kicking her legs in the water and splashing, so I just stopped bathing her in it. Fortunately, my aunt is due in September, so I was able to pass it along to her to use. I really believe that the Saftey 1st products are great and an excellent value at extremely affordable prices."
128449,0,"I chose to go with classic glass bottles because of safety reasons, and for the most part, am happy with my choice. The bottles are great and easy to clean, but the nipples are hard and unyielding. I actually use my Dr. Brown's nipples instead. I also use the internal vent from my Dr. Brown's bottles without the tube. It works great!"
135150,1,"I have 3 children, a 3 month old, a 3 year old, and a 6 year old... As many of you parents of multiples know, its very annoying to want to get some excersize done outdoors having a little kid trailing behind in a tricycle, or scooter, or what ever... heres your solution!I loved how balanced this jogger is, I can have one kid in it, two in it, or even a 6 year old and his littlest sister (when she can sit up I mean)... The wheels move just enough to be able to jog easily and turn ""OK""... It even manuvers well with my scrawny son, hes 6 but it still works just fine for him sometimes! The canopy is better than others, and it does its job. The little bar is cute, although its really only a foot rest for a boistrus 6 year old LOL. The blue is nice, I enjoyed it. The adjustable handle bar is great for when roller blading (my husband, not me!) and its good for tall v.s short, no struggling to find the ""perfect"" stroller for you and your partner! The wheels handle rough terrain like sand, boardwalk, mulch, gravel, bumps, hills, WATER (water on the shore of the beach) mud, snow, rain ANYTHING with ease... a nice and smooth ride for everybody. I love using the jogger in Manhatten when we go to visit my mother, it steers easily and its GREAT at Central Park, the bronx zoo, or just being out and about all the time (she doesnt have a car) Its not too heavy to PUSH, but to lift, and fold its really anoying (well I am a owner of an extravagent SINGLE travel system, Ease with a capital E!!!) but for a double jogger it does fine. It deffinatly fits in my husbands pick up, but it can fit OKAY in my SUV with the front wheel off. I can walk the dog and the kids and my husband always takes the kids for long runs on weekend mornings (sometime up to an hour or so!) They are always comfortable and the 5pt is great for my 2 year old. The basket can store a picnic lunch, jackets, blankets, purse, anything very easily. We use this stroller all the time, and sometimes use this with one child even though we have a single jogger too...I love the simplicity of such a great stroller that really does last and last... I WOULD NOT recomend using this as a primary stroller for the mall and, the airport? its not that nice, but its great for outdoor activities and I honestly couldnt be happier, and neither could my kids who HATE to run behind daddy on those LONG sunday mornings!"
30381,2,"I thought this product would be good, but the whirlpool and shower spray is not what I expected. The buttons don't work well, so you have to push hard on it. Also, the whirlpool and the shower spray do not work at the same time. I guess I expected too much from this product. The tub and baby sling is great, but not worth $40. I think the company should sell the tub and baby sling seperately."
49241,1,"I bought this play yard to help my wife out since work keeps me away from home all too often. I read that someone thought this item seemed cheap, I disagree. It is very sturdy and even helped my son to stand up for the first time. I am extrememly pleased with this play yard. It was very easy to set up and fits great in my family room.My son didn't like it at first, he was annoyed by the seperation it caused between him and my wife, but was over that extremely quickly. This play yard gives my wife the opportunity to take a break from chasing him and having to pick him up and away from the things he shouldn't be playing with. The break allows her to give her back a rest as well.I did buy the extensions so he would have more room to play. My wife has not connected both ends as of yet, she just uses it to connect two walls together and it keeps my son at bay. If you have the space, I definitely recommend the extensions.All in all, my wife and I very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone with an active and roaming child."
10702,1,This is a great little drying rack for all your baby bottles. Does not take up a lot of space either. :)
184036,1,"I registered for this basket because I live in a 3-story townhouse and thought that having a ""portable"" bed for my baby would be handy. I was right - and this basket definitely fits the bill.It's a beautiful basket, made of soft woven grass -- it's flexible and soft, not rigid and scratchy like wicker might be. The foam pad in the bottom is about 1-1/2 inches thick and is firm, so no worries about suffocation. And it's perfect for carrying my sleeping son from one floor to another without waking him.The literature that comes with the basket says it's ok to use for children weighing up to 20 pounds; I get the feeling that my little boy will be too long for the basket before he reaches 20 pounds, but that's ok. The important thing for me was to have a way to move him from floor-to-floor while he was nursing every 3 hours. The basket is a little smaller than a standard bassinet; I've been using bassinet sheets on it and just pulling the extra fabric under the pad. Works like a charm.I'd reccommend this to anyone who is considering a bassinet...especially if space is an issue or if you have a multi-floor house!"
12226,1,"We went through 4 plastic gates in our kitchen doorway before we broke down and bought this one. All those plastic ones are too heavy for the hardware that comes with them and the hinges end up breaking! This lightweight, attractive, and easy to install gate keeps the baby and the dogs out of the kitchen whie letting the cats IN for access to their food & litterbox (I have it installed 4 1/2 inches up from the floor. The baby figured out how to crawl under it when it was 6 inches up so we had to lower it.) It is fantastic and I am back to Amazon to buy another for the top of the stairs. Easy for guests (and sleep-deprived parents) to figure out how to use."
79474,1,"Great product! Was nice to have since size two was getting a bit snug but size three was too big. I am a fan of Pampers diapers anyway, so was excited that they had a 2-3 size. Pampers make a quality diaper."
124135,2,"I bought this last minute right before my baby arrived - it ended up being that up to the last WEEK of my due date we had EVERYTHING but the crib/basket, so I did not do much research and bought what I thought was a good product.The basket itself is OK but the stand is another story.The plastic band cracked while assembling the item. A few weeks later the screws were coming loose (coming out of the wood) and the whole thing became shaky.This is not to mention that the rocking motion was jagged and uneven - you can only rock it from edge to the middle but not from edge to edge of the rounded feet.I used the item for about 3 months, then it stood without for about 6 months, then I gave it to a friend for her newborn. I picked it up 3 months later and tried to disassemble it to fit in my car, and the whole damn thing just fell apart! It's in the trash now, so are my hopes to give it to someone else or resell it.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! You are better off finding another inexpensive solution."
59097,1,"First, before I get negative (and not about the product), let me say this thing's a Godsend. A real joy to use. Very easy to use (read the instructions). The 4-minute warming time for a 4oz Avent bottle is enough to change a diaper, and it won't overheat. What could be easier than that? Baby loves it, and that's all that matters. Kudos to Amazon/Babies-R-Us for offering this wonderful unit.No timer? Unplug? What? READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, as another reviewer stated. Oy."
163286,1,"the mini changer has been great - it allows me to use any bag as a diaper bag. Only minor thing is it really only holds two extra diapers , so its not for a long trip- but great for a short trip when you dont want to pack a bag. It also has a wide changing pad- much nicer than anything that comes with a diaper bag."
56231,1,"This bed is so cute and my son love's it, You would never guess that it was only $100. I am so happy with my purchase and it was pretty easy to put together only took about 45 minute's. I definitely would reccomend this toddler bed."
2216,0,"I started my baby with the Pampers Swaddlers and was very happy, so as she grew, I purchased more Pampers. However, I have now made the move to Huggies. My little girl goes to the bathroom in large quantities and frequently. I found that the Pampers weren't as absorbent as the Huggies and didn't absorb fast enough. I also feel like the Huggies are made out of better quality materials. Less like a plastic pants. The Pampers are fine, better than Luvs, but I'm going to stick with Huggies for now."
70624,1,I love this chair & I definitely recommend it 2 everyone i know! It has been such a life-saver since the day we brought my son home. he's is 6 months now sitting up by himself & never once has he fallen forward. & he LOVES LOVES LOVES to explore everything. He's leaned forward in it before but he never seems to even look like he is going to fall & he's over 17 lbs. I read one review that said her child got out of the safety belt! You must have an amazaing baby because I don't think my son has ever even came close to that either! ITS A GREAT CHAIR that can be used FOREVER (my nephew 2 & 1/2 still uses it to watch movies & loves it) Don't let the reviews scare you this chair is great & I mean if you are worried then just keep your baby close or keep a very close eye on them & nothing will happen! Enjoy!Mami Bree
154542,1,"I like these wipes, but am not crazy about the smell. It would probably be best to keep them in a zippered bag so that they don't dry out too fast."
96964,1,"This was a really great buy.My son was so restless at night,he has a lot of energy.After 8 months of still waking 6,7,8 times a night I tried this product along with a very consistent nighttime routine,and it really did work.He usually sleeps through the night,or gets up once, but such an improvement...Highly recommended!!"
174877,2,"I'm in the process of choosing a waterproof mattress pad for my child's crib, so I was comparing this with several others around the internet and was surprised to read that this one contains polyurethane which, as it degrades over time (a process accelerated if it is exposed to sunlight through the nursery window), gives off toxic fumes that are unsafe for humans of all shapes and sizes. Other products containing polyurethane are sometimes used to strip wood floors and come with warnings about the toxic fumes given off by this chemical- not something you want to have around your baby all the time. They've included the polyurethane here, because it gives the product its waterproof quality, but it would be safer to look for a product that uses polyester for waterproofing, as many other brands do (though that material is highly flammable and not very breathable and there is no such thing as organic polyester or polyurethane because they are both petroleum byproducts). I'll be looking elsewhere, and I hope you will too."
26116,1,"My sister and brother-in-law loaned us this seat when our baby was born (they kept the rest of the travel system), and it worked great for us. It was easy to install, and very easy to strap our baby into. If you have a higher car (like our SUV) then it can be a bit of a struggle to lift the seat out if you're on the short side. If you don't want to spend the extra money on a travel system, or you got your seat second-hand like us you can purchase a universal car seat carrier (Kolcraft makes a great one for $30.00) that adjusts to fit up to 12 different infant-seat brands. We used this with the seat until she outgrew the seat, and it was a great investment. When we have another baby we can just purchase an infant seat to use with the stroller frame. All in all, we were very happy with the carseat."
32452,1,"This is the second Kidco product I have purchased. Let me start by saying that their products are some of the safest out there and I have every confidence in the security of the gates I have installed. BUT, the first gate I purchased was the standard gateway that uses hardware to install. You can see my review there but the thing that is pertinent here is that they only included limited hardware in the box which would not work safely if installing the gate into dry wall (even when there is a stud). So, instead of including another set of screws that would've cost them about $0.90, Kidco likes to make busy parents go buy that stuff themselves.Well, this gate has its own torturous surprise for busy parents who are trying to multitask every hour of the day. Kidco kindly includes two extensions making this gate much more versitile than most on the market. The thing they don't tell you is that these extensions are held in by the same tension that holds the gate into the wall. Each of these tension screws are completely separate from one another (which is good design because it allows installation over uneaven surfaces). However, because there is no mechanism holding these extensions into place, this means that the parent installing the gate must use two hands to hold up the gate, make sure each of the 4 separate extension brackets and two separate support bars, and the 4 metal extension bars which the brackets slide over (none of which lockinto place in anyway) don't fall off, all the while trying to tighten one tension screw at a time... I cannot even explain to you how two limbs are not enough to get the job done and still remain sane by the end of the process.Throw me a bone Kidco! How about the brackets clip or screw that holds the brackets into place so they don't slide off while I'm trying to mount the gate? Something!?!Unfortunately, you will find that Kidco often makes the best products for this kind of thing but they sure do cut corners on the little stuff that would make a parent's life a LOT easier."
173290,0,"When fully charged, the battery in the parent unit only lasts 15 minutes. Unfortunately, I have to move the base around for the parent unit in order to use it. It would be better if the parent unit took AA batteries, then at least I could replace them!"
141015,1,The product was exactly what we ordered. It ended up not being what my daughter wanted and I had to return it unfortuantely. But upon calling for this item to be returned I was pleansantly surprised at how easy they made it for me.Thank you very much and I will shop with you again! Sharon
119516,0,"After reading several reviews, I knew that this product might not work that great but decided to try it anyway. They were right when they said that it has static. We tried it even in the same room and still had the problem. I loved the soothing nature sounds and the light show, but there is no way I would be able to put up with the annoying humming sound!"
95614,1,It came in handy... I was able to fit all of my daughters stuffed animals off the bed and floor. It gave her so much more space in her room.
34957,2,"The Alpha Omega is quite possibly the worst product my wife and I have purchased for our baby, now 10 months old. The only thing worst than an overly complex (horribly complex) and crappy product is two of them...and we made exactly that mistake. My wife purchased one for her car and one for my car.The two primary reasons that product absolutely is the worst product we have purchased for our daughter are as follows:1) It is EXTREMELY to set up...this is a huge failing in the engineering and design. It is easy to make a difficult and cumbersome product; it is challenging to create a well designed and easy / intuitive product. It is VERY clear to me that the engineers that designed this monstrosity have never actually had to use it for their own families.2) You simply cannot remove the cover---in less than 1 hour."
72425,1,"Great value for money, protect the seats well, and help to keep the car seats from shifting about. Have two of these in our Hyundai Sante Fe for our twins, with Graco Snugride, very pleased. Would definitely recommend them to other parents. Fabric and thickness of them is just right."
165565,2,"I purchased Pampers Baby Dry size 4 thinking it was a good price for the Brand Name. However, only a couple hours after placing the diaper on my baby, it began to leak through the front panel. The diaper was hardly full, but my baby's clothes were damp. These diapers definitely don't make it through the night either. All the diapers in this box have been this way. Maybe my Pampers box was a just a lemon. Good luck."
54280,1,"My 3 month old son has loved this mobile since he was 2 weeks old. He is absolutely mesmerized by it.This is a great mobile for imagination, as well as social skills. My son ""talks"" to, makes faces, and chuckles at his geometric friends. Plus, it burns some energy, which my ""active baby"" has tons of - his arms and legs get quite a workout swinging and kicking in excitement.On a sidenote, [if your concerned about] batteries. I have invested in rechargeable batteries - in the long run (or even short run with all of the baby items that need batteries), I think I'll be better off."
6809,1,These diapers are great. No problems with messy leaks or bulkiness. They really hug the body and adjust to fit. Cute designs are an added bonus.
149510,2,"These diapers work fine to prevent leaks, but they have a too much perfume. If it had been stated clearly on the box that they were scented, I would not have purchased them. I don't care for the smell and my baby has sensitive skin, so she doesn't need the added chemicals."
137411,1,"I did a LOT of research on preg pillows in preparation for my 2nd pregnancy. No one mentioned being a tummy sleeper or having poor circulation (and having a preference for flat pillows) so I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best with this pillow. So far I am very pleased with it. It can be manouvered into just about any position - many of the problems people discussed can be fixed if you just play around with it (wrap it tighter around you or push it away). I don't even find the cover scratchy!? As someone who just WON'T fall asleep if I'm not comfortable, I am pleased with this pillow."
83450,2,"I ordered this for my 11 month old son. My biggest complaint is that he sits so far forward that when he falls asleep he lays on the back of my neck. Very uncomfortable! The weight of the carrier does not shift well when putting it on my back. Also, the top seam along the back looks as if it is very stressed and might tear soon. I do like the way the weight is distruibted on my back and shoulders. I am planning on returning it and buying the KELTY TOWN backpack carrier."
116769,2,I was very disappointed with this product. The material is of very poor quality - it was not soft to the touch and it was very very fragile. I had to actually return the item as it was already torn when I received it at the part where you are meant to attach the ties to the car seat handle. I could tell by the look of the material that it would rip very easily. I would not recommend this netting at all.
135030,1,"It is big enough to cover all your baby, which is great. It is real soft and cute."
150688,0,"The product is nice but I misunderstood ""hard wood"" to mean the entire dresser. Instead, it had the typical composite on unseeable parts. It went together easily, however, and looks quite pretty. It's holding up nicely so far."
177758,1,"I ""LOVE"" these white metal portable cribs. I'm a childcare provider and over the past several years I have purchased a total of three. These portable cribs are just the perfect size and don't take up too much space. Unlike many mesh porta-cribs these metal porta-cribs have two height levels and before the children outgrow it their ready for a toddler bed anyways. The price is very compariable to most other mesh porta-cribs but with this metal crib I don't have to worry about the little ones pulling on any strings or making large holes in the netting. These cribs are easy to move from one room to another through the doorway without having to fold/collapse down."
25569,1,These are a MUST for cloth diapering in my opinion. I tried a different brand of diaper liners but they weren't washable or nearly as soft. These are ideal because they'll go through the wash (if not soiled) twice before they start to fall apart. So easy to just carry the soiled diaper to the bathroom and plop the liner into the toilet when needed. Anyone I tell about CDing is opposed to the idea until I tell them about this product. Genius!
60587,1,"Pros: Solid construction, attractive color, large sizeCons: Baby is too big for infant section and too small for big kid section. She slides around a bit, but she enjoys it."
14657,0,"We used these bottles right from the beginning (our son had troubles nursing) and our son loved them! Our son experienced some pretty bad days of gasiness, but overall, no real problems. We did have a lot of issues with the bottles leaking and found that having to change nipple sizes was a bit annoying. A variable flow nipple would have been much easier than having to switch between nipples with different numbers of holes. These were much easier to use than the Avent disposable bottles, which tended to leak and didn't allow me to push the air out. Our son was able to hold these bottles by himself when he was about 6 months old, so that was a real benefit, and we also used the sippee adaptor on them which really extended the life of the bottle!"
79481,1,"These are the best diapers. Our daughter is a little over six months and I have not had a single leak since I started using Pampers Cruisers. I like that they have a little bit of the ""cloth-like"" feel that the Swaddlers had. The amazon price is very comparable to other places (not more but not much less either). I like that they have the free shipping, and even when using the free super saver shipping it got to our house in two days."
26165,1,"I was a little skeptical about this adapter after reading the reviews here. Would it be difficult to install (I read one reviewer say they had to drill holes)? Is it flimsy? Will it work? After testing it out on a hilly 5k course, I can safely say that this adapter does exactly what it is supposed to do!I do agree that the instructions are a bit cryptic, but once you figure out where everything goes, it's a snap to put together. I think they need a few more pictures in their instructions. You do need a wrench for the hex bolts. I installed the plastic clips up on the side bars below the handles right above the first snap. Then I bolted in the adapter. You have to remove the bolt that's in the middle of the side bars and replace it with the long bolt that comes with the adapter. You do NOT have to drill any holes. Once I got everything put together, I snapped in my Graco snugride 32 (with baby inside) and was good to go! I actually forgot to strap in the carseat with the attached belt for the 5k. Oops.My only regret is that I didn't wait another month to purchase this, as the price went down. Oh well. It's definitely worth it if you are a runner, especially if you are training for a race with a baby. I have a half marathon coming up in a month, and will take my baby along for my long training runs."
81561,2,"This was the worst baby product we purchased. There is A LOT of interference. We found ourselves walking around trying to find a spot in the house where it didn't get any static. One night...we actually heard someone's phone call coming through on the monitor. For the most part, you don't even hear your baby...you hear static and noise. I can't believe they can even market an item like this which obviously has many problems. We took ours back. Do yourself a favor, if you get this as a gift...take it back before you even open it. It's junk! We bought a Sony 900Mhz and love it. There is no interference and it is like being in our son's room with him. It gives us much better peace of mind."
82640,1,"This product definitely works! I've been using it with my baby for ten months now and it does a great job blocking out the noise my other two kids make while she's napping. We've travelled with it too and its easy for everyone to fall asleep with its rain sound option. The only issue we have with it is that it's on a timer and we often have to wake up to turn it back on for baby to settle into a deep sleep again. If your baby needs white noise to stay asleep, you'll be going through batteries very quickly.I'd definitely recommend it for a household with multiple kids."
102778,1,"I was surprised to see the bad reviews on this diaper pail. I got mine for a shower gift and haven't had any problems with it. Mine stays shut, doesn't smell, and the springs work fine. I found the deodorizers at Babies-R-Us. I also really like that I don't have to buy special bags for it. I would reccomend this pail from the experience I have had with it."
173474,0,"This was purchased as a second swing - when my older daughter was born I purchased the Ocean Wonders swing and it was the best $100 I spent - she would scream and fight going to sleep until I put her in the cradle swing (she hated the front to back swing I bought) - and then she'd go to sleep within a minute. It was the miracle swing. Our second daughter was born and a really fussy baby. Since my mom was going to watch our daughters when I went back to work, I gave her our old ocean wonders swing and bought this newer model. The ocean wonders still worked perfectly - but this one was prettier, seemed like it would be more comfortable, better music, etc. It's nice. But the one right out of the box had problems - the motor housing made a strange grinding sound, like it was laboring - and this was when only the mobile was working, it wasn't even swinging. I called Fisher Price - I can't say enough about their customer service. They said they would send out a replacement as soon as they were available - it was backordered a month or so, which led me to believe that there was a problem with the housing in general. I got the new one and no strange sounds. For a month. Then the mobile stopped working. My younger daughter was content if the swing wasn't even moving if she could see the birds moving around. The music played, the swing would swing, but no mobile movement. I called Fisher Price and to their credit they offered to send me another motor or a shipping voucher to send it back for a full refund. I decided to stick with it and get a new motor housing unit. But this is the third motor in as many months, and it's back ordered until mid-April - so I suspect there's a problem with the product in general. I haven't seen any other reviews that mention this, so maybe my experience is rare.That said - the music is much better for this swing - it's much quieter than the ocean wonders swing (although that didn't bother me or my daughter). The colors certainly go better with the rest of the house. The birds are cute and the mirror on the bottom is nice, but I have to say I think the underside of the ocean wonders swing is probably more interesting for a child - little sea creatures moving around and all that. If it hadn't been for the mechanical malfunctions, I probably would have given this another star."
3338,1,"I don't know about it's use for flat/inverted nipples, but this product works well for sore nipples. My first month of breastfeeding has been like a roller coaster of pain. This is what I found helps my dry, bleeding, or cracked nipples: I use generous amounts of lanolin cream after EVERY feeding with Gerber cold therapy packs, topped off by these shells. The shells effectively keep air circulating and clothes from touching sore, cracked skin. They do look a little strange under your clothing if you wear tight shirts (I don't recommend them for you if you do). You can put a thick nursing pad on top of them to round it out. I like Johnson's nursing pads because they have a special indention inside for the nipple, and that gives a more natural look under clothing on the other side. I took off the ring on the back and just use the shell part, because I have large breasts with especially big areola. My only qualm with this product is that it is made of HARD plastic. I wish the back side was made of softer plastic or silicone, like bottle nipples. Overall, a great product that will keep me breastfeeding successfully!"
112932,1,"I'm over 6' tall with really long legs. For a sturdy-yet-lightweight stroller, this is the best choice because the handles are high (you don't have to stoop to reach them). My one complaint, however, is that the handles are set close to the stroller so I kick the wheels sometimes. (EVERY lightweight stroller is like this, though, so I got this type b/c the handles are high. At least I'm not stooping and kicking.)One other issue I have is the brake: it isn't very strong. I set the brake and put my child in the seat, but just that little bit of motion has caused the brake to unlock itself.The basket is big for a lightweight stroller and it doesn't tip if I take my little one out of the stroller but leave the diaper bag draped over the handles.Oh, and it fold up easily (although unfolding it the first few times was a little difficult, just to warn you). It doesn't take up a ton of trunk space, either.Overall I would most definitely recommend this to all, but especially to tall, parents looking for a good vslue."
7238,1,This was a little challenging to assemble. The slats didn't want to stay put. But once assembled it's been great. Very sturdy and looks great too. Fits our standard crib mattress well.
74255,1,"My husband calls me a stroller addict! The Caboose makes the 5th stroller for us and I really like it! I got this one for as it's perfect quick trips to the mall or running errands. It's to open and close, not overly heavy. My one major complaint...the back seat slides back and forth while my little one is sitting. It would be great if it had a lock to keep in place."
49289,1,I was looking for a baby gate we could use around our Christmas Tree to keep our curious 12 month old out of trouble. This play yard/baby gate has worked perfect! We have pergo flooring in our living room so the stick-on skid-resistant pads keep the gate from sliding. There was practically no assembly; just take it out of the box and unfold it. Another thing I was pleased to see was this product is American made!
152540,1,The best bundle me ever. Easy to put on and take off. Keeps baby warm all winter!
97345,1,"I use this pump once a day so my husband can feed the baby at night. I am easily able to pump out a feeding in about 10 - 15 minutes. It has a dial for adjusting suction and the pieces come apart easily for cleaning. It comes with two textured breast shields (1 small and 1 large) and if you don't like the textured shield, you can contact the company for an untextured shield. They sent one at no extra cost.I've been using now, 1-2 times a day, for 6 months and no complaints about lost suction or anything else.I gave it 4 stars because I put one of the shields in the microwave sterilizer and it bent where I placed it in the breast shield slot. I called the 800 number and got a replacement within 3 days (at no cost to me). Great customer service!"
48018,1,This is the second keepsake box I have purchased. I am very happy with it. It has lots of spaces for all sorts of things from hospital bracelets and cards to baby teeth later on. I love the fact that there is a special drawer for the memory book that is also available. The book isn't the best but works for what you need if you aren't a scrapbooker type. The set makes a great gift.
3652,1,"From reading the reviews I knew I wasn't getting the item pictured, I received one of these cups:Playtex-Disney-Princess-Insulator-PackI was very pleased because I love these, I have never had problems with them leaking."
44543,1,"We used pampers for the newborn stage, and they worked well, but the didn't seem to do the trick as our daughter grew. We made the switch to Huggies. Much better. No leaking and easily put on and taken off. My wife likes that this design is relatively plain so colors don't show through outfits."
5477,1,The litter bag was what I expected eceot for the way it mounted on floor but the way they devised works fine. It is big enough to hold 5 or 6 cans of soda pop or water bottles but not take up to much room on the center hump works great for my 2005 chey colorado would recommend it for anyone with a big central hump in their vehicle
132012,0,"While the theme and colors are adorable, the set is not worth the price. I bought the set, which includes bumpers, not realizing that you are not supposed to put bumpers in the crib with the baby, as they increase the chance of SIDS. You're better off just buying the sheet, quilt and valance separately. I bought all the matching things for the room, (hamper, mobile, lamp, border...etc.) and it is ADORABLE, but I just wished I wouldn't have spent my money and the set.."
4341,1,This less expensive version of the Bob stroller caddy is perfect! it fits everything you could need while out and about with the stroller. I am so glad I got this and didn't splurge on the &#34;brand name&#34; alternative. I highly recommend this product. No complaints.
32887,0,I heard rave reviews about this product so I had to have one. My son needed to snuggle all the time and I had a poorly made cheaper model. Since my daughter was born I have used it one time while at a historial park. It's a great product but make sure you have a need for it and want to invest the money.
176103,0,I've read other reviews elsewhere which suggested using any pillowcase of your choice instead of this sheet. That's what I'll be doing.
36873,1,"I purchased this almost four years ago with the birth of my daughter intending to use it when I was breastfeeding her. Turned out, I had to have an emergency c-section and this was a LIFESAVER. I doubt I would have been able to comfortably feed her in the beginning without it.Interestingly enough, I'm now expecting my second child and I pulled out the ol' Boppy to wash and my almost four year old daughter 'stole' it. She uses it to watch TV (as a prop for her head) and as a pillow at night.I had to purchase another one.This really is a great product. I definately wouldn't skip on this if your breastfeeding and/or having a c-section."
134267,1,"Not just for babies. Everyone can benefit from the wipe warmer. Caring for an elderly person, babies, family. You can't go wrong with this."
106502,0,"Well this was a great diaper pail in the beginning, but once god put smell into those little angels poops the diaper lost it's place in the house. Now we keep the pail out on the porch. Its still a good product in the sense that we dont have to buy those expensive refills and it will hold a good 4-5 days of diapers , but it would be nice to keep it inside next to the changing table where it belongs. All in all someone needs to come out with somthing better."
144326,1,We purchased this car seat because of its known quality. So far it is great and I have to say i was worried about the material but my daughter loved it as soon as she sat in it. We even were thinking about taking it off and putting it in her crib so that she would sleep better.
116317,1,"These baskets are quality made and look so precious on my soon-to-be-born granddaughter's changing table. Accents a room wonderfully. I ordered two and they will complete the changing table with all the goodies on it for the shower. Perfect size for all kinds of baby things from bibs, onesies, washcloths, diapers, etc."
78846,1,"EASY PEASY! I've traveled a lot alone with our son and typically put his carseat in a travel bag that could be worn as a backpack. Pregnant this time with our second, I decided I didn't need/want the extra strain on my back. Searched out this product and thought for the price it was worth a shot... BEST decision. We tried it out at home with a packed carry-on and he didn't want to get out! In the airport, it was the same. He normally wants to be held all the time, but he preferred his carseat on wheels- PHEW! EVERYONE took note and I had MANY comments from people about how smart the gadget was and how they wished they would have had one for their kids. GREAT PRODUCT!"
104877,1,"I love this diaper bag.....it's durable, large, has 2 nice size pockets for a nalgene size water bottle or babies bottle on both sides, a parent pocket for my wallet, What is best is it has options for how ever you want to carry it. For me I needed a backpack style so my hands could be free to hold one of my kids hand and carry the other. I pack heavy and there is always enough room for what I need plus more with this bag...but it still fits under my stroller in the basket. It is great for 1 baby or 2 toddlers plus my stuff. I am on my second one in 4 years of everyday use. I broke the zipper forcing it:( I am also very rough on stuff. I got couple other diaper bags over the years and have tried them, but they just don't compare. My husband loves it just as much as I do. I couldn't find the 07 model anywhere but amazon had it and for half the price."
77393,2,"We used this swing for HOURS per day when my baby was a newborn. We used it until she outgrew it, and tried to get out, and then it was scary. The tray wasn't very helpful at keeping her in, and in fact was difficult to put onto the swing itself. It was frustrating that you had to take the entire tray off to get the baby in or out, and I was always afraid that I would get my daughter's leg stuck underneath the tray. When my daughter was about three months old, the tray fell off, because I hadn't totally latched it (which happened a lot) because it didn't quite match up with the little plastic notches. She almost fell out by reaching for a butterfly, and that was the last time that I used the swing. I also owned the Fisher Price Rainforest swing, and that tray was always on there, you just swung it out of the way. I do not know why they didn't do that on this model. Both swings were able to be plugged in which I HIGHLY recommend. Regardless of rechargeables, it was sooo easy to just plug her in, and let her swing. She loved both the swings, but I absolutely HAD TO HAVE the pink one. The butterflies were so cute, and she loved looking at them. I just wish the tray had been better and then I would have felt more secure about using it for longer than I did. I paid a pretty penny for this pretty swing, and for the value I should have just stuck with the rainforest swing, which I had to sell so that I could get the pink one. The pink papasan was quite a bit more expensive than the rainforest, but this was my last child, and I wanted everything to be PINK...I just wish they would have put the quality into the pink one, instead of just the sugar and spice!!!"
122865,0,"One of my first jobs as a teenager was at Taco Bell one of my duties in the kitchen was to learn to make a burrito. When my son was born, the first night at the hospital I was having a hard time getting him to stay put so I could feed him. I called the nurse in and she wrapped him in just the same technique. I asked her to show me and as she proceded to, I laughed and said, ""Oh, I get it, like a burrito!"" She laughed and said, ""yes, just like a burrito."" It's quite simple and just the images supplied on here are enough for you to learn to do this wrap with any nursing blanket. I find it ridiculous to pay so much money for something you can simply learn from a nurse at the hospital or at Taco Bell. Save your money get the blankets similar to the ones used in the hospital and wrap your kid in that. Just remember to do it tight enough for him/her to not be able to move it's little arms out of it."
106435,1,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after my neighbor recommended it. No special refills, you simply use your own garbage bags. I have not had any problem with oder. I do use the scented garbage bags and I spray it with lysol after I empty it everytime. I have been telling everyone about it! It is great!!!!"
97618,1,"I've never written a review before, but just had to put my two cents in for this potty chair. This is the third one we've gotten for my three year old and she absolutely loves it! It is the perfect size for her (most other potties are way too small for a preschooler). She refused to use the potty until we got this one. It has been wonderful. I do agree with some of the other reviews in that there are a lot of little areas under the seat to clean, but everything is easy to get to. Ours also arrived with scuff marks on the lid, but was obviously not used, so don't know what happened there. Overall, this product is wonderful for the price. It is high quality and easy to use all around!"
117485,1,"We got this jumper for our 4 month old girl and she LOVES it!!! She is now 5 months and will happily spend 30 minutes to an hour in it, 3 or 4 times a day. She jumps, she spins, and just hangs out. We considered a walker but since we don't have the space, this is perfect. It is awesome for helping her strengthen her legs. The biggest pros are the tray, toy attachments, bumper and sturdiness. I would highly recommend this product."
64685,1,This is wonderful. My daughter is 5 months old & loves everything in this gift set.
183858,1,"I absolutely love this product. The plastic bag that the products came in are wonderful for storage purposes. I doubt that I will be using the bag to actually carry the containers around whenever I am out and about, but it helps to keep the cupboard space used minimal. I am also very impressed with the quality of the storage containers and can't wait until I am able to use this product on my little one. At this moment we are using them for my 2 year old nephew and they are indestructable. Great product."
51640,1,"I loved the GoGoRider infant carrier. Its very comfortable to me and my baby. Little Tanjaliah falls fast asleep every time I put her in it. I used to take a carseat and carseat carrier, but this is much easier to deal with since your hands are free. The pocket on back is just big enough to carry a couple of diapers, small pack of wipes and a bottle. My daughter and I both use it, however I plan to get another one to keep in my backpack/car. Love this productSherry"
11465,2,"This monitor has bugged me after 6 months of use. Lots of static, random buzzing & now it just plain wont work! It did well showing the light gage of noises in my daughters room. When Im trying to sleep & the monitor is randomly buzzing its down right annoying. there shouldnt be a problem like the buzzing since my house is 1000sq ft & all other electronics in the house arent interfering. The battery life is really short so we had to keep it plugged in all the time. I figured buying an item over $50 it would be a solid piece of equipment but its junk to me & disapointing. Keep your receipt!"
149006,0,"this pillow is way too short so the only way to make it work is to use it upside down. this also solves the second main problem: that its cover is made of a poor material and pills badly, so that it ends up being itchy as hell. i have been sleeping with my head on my normal pillow and wrapping the pillow around my body to support my legs and belly -- which ever side I sleep. It works well this way. still itches, but using pjs instead of a nightgown solves it. I still would buy it I think, but it is a bit pricey for all the adjustments it needs."
7880,0,"The product arrived in good time, however I was dissappointed to see that the quality was not as high as I would have hoped. The edges were a little rough, possibly causing cuts on the mouth. Also, I would have prefered to have the spoons as right handed implements and the forks as left handed, so that my child could use one in each hand or at least to have the option of using either hand."
14763,1,I love this bottle. I first purchased the platex system because it got such great reviews. My infant son had big time problems drinking from the nipple. I switched to this bottle and now mother and baby are very HAPPY.
155449,1,Delivered on time and in good condition. The color is as it appeared on the website. I've washed it several times and still looks like new.
108648,0,"I got these for 80% off for the price I couldn't beat it. But the quality isn't good at all, the liner is fine but the basket pieces are constantly breaking off. I wanted to use these for my 12 month old's small toys in his playroom to keep on the floor for his easy access but I have to closely supervise him to be aware of pieces coming free."
52448,1,I recently purchased this swing for my 10 week old son. I had a bigger swing but my 2yr. old burned up the motor when he kept playing in it. ( He had a hard time letting younger brother use his old things ) So I never really got to use it for my baby. It was going to cost me about $45 to replace the motor so I decided it would be more worth my time and $$ to purchase a new inexpensive swing. Out of all the swings I looked at this one looked the best. And considering I have a two story home it would be nice to have something portable. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;I was a bit hesitant at buying it because of some of the reviews that I saw but I purchased it anyway. My son loves it so far!! He doesn't have any problems with falling over. He likes the lights ! I can put him to sleep in there and he will sleep for hours. I don't know what I would do without it. I don't mind the fact that it is so low to the ground. I like to sit on the floor and play with my baby anyway. I love this swing ! LOVE IT !!!!
41588,0,"We registered for and recieved this monitor when we had our first child. It was FANTASTIC!! We never had any problems with it whatsoever. Then, when our son became a toddler, he broke the base. We were expecting our 2nd child at the time so we just replaced it. Everything started out just fine. But very shortly after we bought it, the channel switches went all screwy. To listen on channel 2, the base had to be on channel 1 and the recievers on channel 2. then the channel switches on the recievers sort of shorted out. If they were even slightly jostled they would go into this in-between two channels setting and turn the reception to static. We had to constantly jiggle them to get them back to the correct channel, which wasn't actually the correct channel according to the switch on the base. ???So, our first experience with these monitors was exceptionally good. Our 2nd and last experience was disappointing. I think we'll try the Graco set this time around."
158714,1,"My daughter is 21 months old and we are just now starting to phase out of the sleep sacks. Up until now she has always slept in one. Putting it on was an important part of her sleep routine and signaled to her it was time to get snuggly and go to bed. they were great when she was really tiny cause you didn't have to worry about her getting tangled up in it or having it wrapped around her face/head. she moves a lot in her sleep so you always knew the blanket would stay on, didn't have to worry about her getting cold, having to sneak in to cover her up again, etc. We got them in both the heavier fleece and the lighter cotton . . . pairing them with either lighter or heavier pajamas underneath gave us plenty of options to fit whatever the weather was outside (obviously in the summer we only used lightweight cotton, sometimes with just a diaper underneath). I'm a big fan of the sleep sacks."
59322,1,We are using this to protect our puppies from taking a leap when they should not. Very happy.
115188,1,"We got this gait as a shower gift from our registry. Though it is very expensive it is well worth the money. We are only using it to keep the animals (cats and a large dog) in the basement for now since the baby is not even here yet. This gait was very easy to install and use once up. It even keeps the cats out, which most gaits don't. We will be getting more as soon as we need them."
94045,0,"This is a good quality product, but I would probably not buy it again or recommend it because the compartments are kind of small. When I am serving two things to my child, I usually want more space for each item. Also, it is not stackable with other bowls because of the shape so you have to find another way to store it, which can be a problem if space is tight."
142684,1,This has been the best product I have ever purchased! I had a scheduled C-Section with my son and it came in so handy in the hospital since it was hard for me to move around. It is comfortable and convenient to use. I would recommend it to everyone!
174465,1,our 7 week old baby loves this mobile and can't stop smiling and staring at it when it's on. great buy...
113391,0,As I mentioned above this monitor worked very well for us then after about 16 month the sound started to fade away and after 18 month completely disappeared. We used it only during naps and early night hours. I'd like this product to last longer that's why I gave 3 stars.
22189,1,"A lot better than the old Breastmilk bags, as they are much easier to use than the old kind. Still I usually pump the milk in a bottle first and then save it in the bag."
86966,1,"The easiest bottle ever and at an afforable price. The drop-in liners are a blessing when you're always in a rush (like me). The nipples come in three sizes (slow, medium and fast flow) so you can use these bottles as your baby gets older just by replacing the nipples. I bought a two-pack of fast-flow nipples for about $4.00. Replacement nipples and liners are available in many stores so they are easy to find. Target sells their own brand of 4 oz liners that are just as good as the Playtex brand, but cost less (about $4.00 for 100 count). Another great thing: the liners don't have to go in the garbage, they can go in your recycle bin instead."
59030,2,Heats up the bottle in much less time than the directions say (I boiled my first bottle). The lack of on/off switch is unsafe. My hand slipped pulling the plug from the outlet and I hit the warmer and knocked it over -- scalding water and all! I was (thankfully) holding my baby away from the counter - but this could have been a disaster.
47833,1,"I have had this gate for about two years. I'm here on Amazon deciding if I want to buy this gate again, or try something else. I have two dogs, a Min. Schnauzer and a Bichon who is a jumper and a digger....she has pushed and dug with her paws to the point where she can open the gate on her own now.....the pressure closure looses some presure as time goes on.The best part of this gate is it's clear, so it doesn't seem like a hideous gate....it's appealing and easy to use. I don't think a child would be nearly as rough on this gate as my dogs, so I recommend it!"
81339,0,"This stroller came with the car seat as a travel system--loved it for that purpose! I can go shopping with it and it is not bulky at all. It is smaller than most travel system strollers. However, I came across this in the umbrella stroller category, and this is misplaced! My husband complains all the time about how big this stroller is (to be fair, he is very picky about the size of strollers taking up space). But I would have to say this is not an umbrella stroller. Find something else if that is what you need!"
135928,2,If you're thinking about getting these bottles for 3 months or older infants you might as well go with other bottle brands.We purchased 2 starter pak(3 bottles per pak)in the beginning. They came with 4 level 1 nipples 2 level 2 nipples. When we ordered additional 2 paks of 8 oz. bottles they all came with level 1 nipples.(Be advised that when you order these bottles they don't give you choice of level 1 or 2 nipples)Our daughter is now 10 months old. We now have 12 bottles with 10 level 1 nipples that WE CANNOT USE ANYMORE and only 2 level 2 nipples. We emailed the company numerous times in efforts to purchase level 2 nipples but they haven't responded as of yet.We even tried calling their Toll Free # but haven't been able to get through.We even tried making the holes on the level 1 nipples bigger by using needles and everything else we could think of but it is almost impossible as the nipple is made of silicon.These bottles are made in CHINA and their customer service is one of the WORST.
136739,2,"i bought this thinking it would be so great. First of all it did not fit on the end of the crib so we had to put it on the back side and at the time we still had the matress up high, we thought that would work until in the middle of the night my baby rolled into it and turned it on! uhggggg what a nightmare. It woke me and both babies up ( dad slept thought it all of course ). So the next day I took it out of the crib and put it away. Now the boys are 11 months old and the matress is lowered so I put it up again. My other baby has the aquarium one in his crib and has a blast with it in the mornings and my other baby just stares at him because his toy is out of batteries. Also the aquarium one has little buttons that they can play with and the soother doesnt. So even when the other one is out of batteries it can still be played with."
180392,1,"the quality of this bag seems pretty good. It is strong and the material is easy to clean. The bag is relatively small inside but it works for us that do not like to carry much stuff and only the necessary (diapers for a day, wipes, drink for dad, extra 2 outfits, nursing cover, burping cloth, snacks for mom, bottle, and other extra stuff. This bag maybe a little small for travel since it seems you may want to bring more stuff just in case. But overall it works great for us."
15541,2,"I bought this gate to put at the bottom of stairs. The mesh and nylon part is held on by velcro. The 1st day is was up my daughter was running towards it and fell onto the mesh part, the velcro gave way and my daughter fell face first onto the bottom step. She got a cut on her forehead and a black eye!!!! My little girl is very tiny (about 22 pounds), if she can fall right through this thing I'd hate to see what a bigger huskier toddler could do to it. I called the company minutes after this happened, it was after hours so I left a message....no response.If you love your child DO NOT buy this gate. Velco is not what I would call safe and secure."
42813,0,"There's too much fabric to wrap around, it gets hot during the summer with all that fabric. If you are outside and you want to wrap it, it's so long that it drags over the floor and gets dirty. I wouldn't rate it high on the ease of use, and also, since you have to tie the end, the knot comes lose after a while. I didnt use it more than a few times only. You are better off saving that money and spend it towards an ergo baby or one of those other backpacks. Or get a sling that you don't have to wrap around so much."
95636,1,"My daughter has so many plush toys that her bedroom floor was covered with them. So my husband and I decided to purchase this large hammock to hold all of them. It holds most of the toys, but the anchor screws wouldn't stay in place in our sheetrock walls. My husband had to purchase better quality anchors to keep it attached to the wall. I would recommend this hammock because the quality seems to be good so far, but beware of the anchor screws."
141243,0,"Less than a year after purchase, it suddenly stopped working. Replaced battery- didn't work. Took it apart to realize that a thin wire had disconnected. Fortunately, we have the equipment to solder it back, but you'd think a kids toy like this would be designed a little more sturdy to handle repeated impact, especially since the front toy is difficult to connect to the push cart."
90776,1,Love Pampers baby dry - they work great for my daughter and I use them at night since she sleeps for up to 12 hours. I have been using them at night for her since she was an infant and she is now 14 months. I switched to Luvs during the day though since they are cheaper.
169665,1,lots of space for my son stuff help me see when I am almost out. I think we will keep this when we are my son does not need it and maybe uses in other parts of the house. like bath room. Other then that works great I have it hanging in with his t-shirt now it keeps all the stuff away from him.
172619,2,"Because the button is directly on the sprayer, it is cumbersome to handle, especially when you are washing a newborn infant and need to be able to use both hands quickly(they should have thought of a handle with a squeeze trigger or something). The battery compartment has 5 screws to loosen and they don't tighten back correctly- far too many with a newborn, you just don't have the time to spend doing this- and I used a drill-driver. I have had to change the batteries three times and I have had it only three months!My advice is to buy it for the tub and great accessories for the baby to grow in to using and don't get excited about the shower spray part."
40847,1,"These were great at $7.50, but too expensive now. I suggest Target to everyone. They have great prices and selection, as well as you can use your coupons!"
46548,2,Bought this fir my preschooler and 7 month old baby only to read when received that it's not to be used with baby cause they may become entrapped and suffocate ... It should say this on the product description!!!
81616,2,"We purchased this set of monitors and wished we hadn't.Pro's:* Comes with two monitoring unitsCon's:* Static is very annoying! The background noise on these is ridiculous! They seem to pick up every type of interference in the area which makes hearing baby very difficult.* Picks up cordless phone conversations all of the time (could be a benefit if you're into that type of thing...)* Even without static or noise, the sound quality on the listening units is average to poor.In a nutshell: DON'T BUY THIS MONITOR! Purchase the Sony Baby Call model, it is very much worth the extra money."
26452,1,Beautiful bassinet that makes caring for your litle one so much easier. EASY TO ASSEMBLE. Would reccomend it to anyone expecting
146816,1,"I'd had my eye on this stroller bag for a while, and I bought it when the price was too good to pass up. This is a small bag that attaches with velcro to the metal bars on the side of a stroller, and gives you some extra room to hold a few essentials. Diapers, wipes, snack, sippy cup or bottle will all fit in there, and perhaps a few more smaller things. (I've never stuffed it to the brim.) Not gonna hold a ton of things, just carry your diaper bag if you need to bring a lot of stuff.I like the Saddle Bag because my Maclaren Quest has a small basket that is kind of a pain to get into if the kid is in the stroller. Hanging things from the handles causes the stroller to tip over backwards because it is so light. This product works great for a quick jaunt to the park. Also, if your stroller (like mine) has no baby bar in the front to hold the little darling's sippy cup, you can stick it in here. I got the navy color, and it is very nice. The quality is identical to the Skip Hop diaper bag I bought my husband, very durable and easy to care for. I may get another one for the other side of the stroller, I like this one so much."
131435,1,"My daughter, 5, really likes this booster seat. she says it is very comfortable. The only things I don't like about it, is that the back section and the seat section come apart too easily and it is quite tricky to get them back together. Also the pull out cup holders could be a bit larger for the larger sippee cups that are made today. When she falls asleep, her head rolls forward, so there is not enough side support for the head when sleeping. I really like the slot in the head section for the seat belt. That keeps it in place very nicely."
54126,0,"I actually bought these after an incorrigible (and very lucky!) cat of mine walked across the stovetop when it was off, and accidentally turned on one of the burners. On that stove, these worked PERFECTLY. Then I moved to another place with a different stove and these are useless on it. It all has to do with how much ""clearance"" there is between the back of the knob and the surface of the panel. If it's a snug fit, these will work great, but if there's much of a gap, these won't help. I'll be buying the bubble-style knob covers for the stove I have now."
159913,2,"So, we have had a similar experience that this gate is a big pain if you plan to open it. It also damaged the paint and plaster on our wall. The only saving grace is that we could use it to block off the bottom of the stairs OR the doorway between the kitchen and living area with it hardware mounted in one place b/c of the perfect fit feature. Our hinge also broke and they were going to charge to replace it, but after I complained they agreed to send it no charge, which I guess is better than buying a new gate."
94825,1,"I have used cloth diapers on my daughter for almost 6 months now, but just finally decided to switch to cloth wipes. I read numerous reviews before decided on these, and I am very happy with my purchase so far. I purchased 2 sets, a total of 30 wipes, which is more than sufficient. I wash my diapers every other day, and just toss these in my diaper bin with the diapers and wash them all together. I definitely could have only purchased one set; although it is nice to be able to always have several stashed in the diaper bag. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because after the first wash, some of the colored thread around the edges came unraveled. I now wash and dry everything on the delicate cycle and haven't had any further problems. The wipes are so soft and my little girls bum couldn't be happier. I use my own wipes solution that I soak the wipes in, then ring out, and then place in the wipes warmer; in which they fit perfectly. Very happy, and saving so much money!"
181469,1,"We bought 2 of these for our baby jogger & they are truly awesome!! They have two modes-one is constant & the other is a blinking mode. It has the 3 LCD lights within 1 compartment as you see in the picture which really enhances brightness. In the winter when it gets dark so fast, we still like to run & walk, but it was frightening because we really felt like people weren't able to see us until they got too close. Once we mounted these on the jogging stroller, we noticed cars moving away from us way before we ever felt they were too close. We even had a couple of people in cars thank us fr making ourselves so visible. We have had the lights for about 5 years now & they are still working as well as the day we bought them."
28967,1,"This is a great rocker. I bought it for my daughter, who is expecting a little one soon. She can't believe how comfy it is! The arms are padded nicely and it glides smoothly. You cant beat the price, especially since it comes with a matching stool! It has big pockets on the outside of the arms, which is so handy."
64834,1,"This is a great product! I didn't even think of registering for this. My son has acid reflux so he needs to be upright most of the time. A neighbor lent me hers to try to see if he would like it & he LOVES it. He gets such a kick out of just the lights alone, I wish everything had lights on it! And it's been very helpful to take when we go to the granparent's houses too or just to take him in different rooms in the house. I highly recommend this item. We bought it at BJ's wholesale club for only $39.99."
63460,0,I have the expensive version of this evenflow excersaucer and my son loves it. I wanted to but the less expensive version for his babysitter's house. The price for this one is great. The problem is the toys are a little cheapy looking and in less than one day my son practically broke it as one of the parts unhinged. We have to keep putting it back together since my sons lovejumping and spinning in it. It definitely is not as sturdy as the expensive evenflow one. I say go for the more expensive ones. They are definitely worth the price.
11220,1,"We got this product so we can have a portable crib when we travel overnight. We haven't yet taken this on a trip yet but expect to do so this Christmas. Portability and ease of setup/disassembly were important to me and the Graco Pack N Play passed with flying colors. I took a star off because some of the accessories that I thought was included was not but it still came with plenty.Other minor quibbles... The included changing station is certainly strong and we use it almost exclusively now, but our baby at 5 months has almost outgrown it. In a few months, I expect her legs would dangle over the edge. Included mobile is very basic and it would have been nice to have a windup component. But that's pretty much it for the negatives.It's an excellent product and I recommend it."
85546,1,bought these as a gift for a small child. he loved them and had to decorate his room immediately. very easy to use and comes off easily.
75193,1,"WAY more ecinomical than the other pumps, it works teriffic! Zero complaints. Don't waste your money on the more expensive ones, this one gets the job done."
155993,0,I thought this twisty toy would be something new & fun for my 5 month old to chew on. I'm not a huge fan. Mostly because I think it's too awkward and big for a baby to try and hold and get their mouth around. She hits herself in the face a lot too trying to get it into her mouth. Maybe when she is older she can play with it just for fun but as a teether it's not functional.
39023,1,Great for anyone who doesn't like diaper pins and doesn't want the velcro to scratch their baby - we were using the velcro but now prefer the snaps.
90928,1,"No leaks, no blow outs!! I also love them because it's easy to tell if she has wet or not, other brands are so thick it's kinda hard to tell."
184343,1,"My husband and I just had a wonderful baby girl (Apr. 9, 2007) and I simply could NOT live without this item. My daughter loves sleeping in it.It is light; therefore, it can be easily moved from one room to another, as needed. You could easily travel with it.... from hotels to the ""Grandparents house."" It can be folded compactly and easily stored; and, there is also a handle for carrying. The light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co-sleep as well. ***Obviously, do not leave your child unsupervised in it!**It is excellent and I highly recommend it to ALL parents!"
5320,1,"I recently bought a McLaren Volo Dylan's Candy umbrella stroller for my grand daughter, Sophie (2-1/2) who travels with her mom quite a bit, and we'd like to protect the stroller as much as we can so it will last longer.I looked at various stroller travel bags and found that the JL Childress umbrella stroller travel bag is the best one. The stroller fits inside the padded travel bag nicely with some room left so you can store other items i.e. toys, rain shield etc. It's light, has a handle and fold neatly into square so you can store inside a bag pack until you have to pull out at the jet bridge for the stroller. The best part is the price, under $30 for something so well made. Any parents with nice expensive umbrella strollers who travel a lot with their todders should get one to protect your stroller from wear and tear, worth the purchase!"
127720,0,"My bed was missing a drawer! That was one of the features that helped me choose this bed but atlas, it was missing. The instruction manual didn't even have the slightest mention of a drawer, not even in the diagrams for setting it up. Everywhere online that sells this bed describes it with a drawer and even shows pictures of it. Reviews even praise the drawer so I know that there must be one. Contacted Amazon and we resolved the issue. It's obviously a manufacturers problem.Besides the missing part defect, I really like the bed. It is sturdy, the rails are the perfect size to keep my son in the bed w/o being over barring like his crib was becoming. Looks more modern in person with the right bedding and setting. Looks a little ""country"" online.My 2 year couldn't be happier with his big boy bed and has had no problems sleeping in it through the night.If we received the drawer, I'd of given it 4 stars."
18011,0,I bought this based on all the reviews but am very disappointed with the musical motion sensor. It doesn't work most of the time so either I have to turn it on all the time or not at all. The colors are great and it does keep him interested for a while. But all babies only last a while!
54679,1,"It's colorful, fun, and musical. Great deal! It makes any baby's room a more exciting and brilliant place! The music is great, lasts 15 minutes or so - you can jump in the shower why baby kicks and plays to the mobile. Don't waste your money on other ones to simply &quot;match&quot; the theme - add colors and fun!"
9340,1,"We read the reviews posted about the BabyBjorn Potty Chair and based on all the reviews for boys we thought we would give it a try. We purchased the BabyBjorn Potty Chair for our 2 year old son, we had the potty for about a half hour and our little boy went potty two times the first day, and 4 times the second day. This potty is easy to clean all you do is simply wash the potty and take a lysol or clorox wipe to disinfect and your done. The best thing about this product is that it only has two pieces. With the inside base being white is a great feature when your teaching kids to potty, they can actually see what they did in the potty unlike most of the other potty products on the market that have a colored inside base. Needless to say we have also tried the Graco potty and it is now with the city dump yard. I recommend this potty for it's simplicity. Five stars all the way."
19007,0,"This is a great stroller for your babies when they are little. But as they get to be a year old or up, its very hard to steer, the wheels are not sturdy for constant use and the back seat does not have a tray. If you have twins id think about getting a more sturdy stroller. Then again, you get what you pay for."
45974,1,"Who knew something so simple is all they really need to be entertained. When my daughter was an infant she loved the red white and black, it is truly a creepy mezmorizing thing for infants! I have bought this as a baby shower gift ever since. I know it looks far to simple and when my mom gave it to me and I was putting it together I could not stop making fun of it!! But turned out my daugheter loved it! At 1.5 months I would but her in her bouncy seat, with the vibration off, and attach the mobile to the side, and she would stair at all the pictures forever - 30 minutes plus! After I was done with it, my sisters best friend had a baby that would screem whenever he entered the crib, never even giving it a chance, I let her borrow my mobile, as my daughter had grown out of it, and she loved it! Says it worked likea charm for both of her sons! It's a nice feeling to know that you have found something that your baby truly likes and is stimulated by at such a young age. It was the first thing that triggered that response from her! It was really neat to watch!"
179541,1,"This is our second one after I mistakenly ran over our first one with the car just before taking off with the 2 kids (both under 3) on a transatlantic flight. I never missed my GoGo Babyz travelmate more than on that first leg of the journey where one child had to walk, the baby in a stroller and me needing to carry the car seat for the littlest one for the plane ride. Did I mention I was travelling alone??? Had I had the Travelmate in action, the day would have gone so much smoother and with a lot less stress. I ordered another one to be waiting for us when we arrived in Florida, the return journey was so much nicer.I tell you this is a godsend product and once you use it you wonder what you did before. Not having to check a stroller, having your little one secure on a plane in their car seat, and then not needing to rent a car seat on the other end, and all because of this product!?! Incredible!We travel a lot so it's definitely been well used and the number of comments I get on it in the airport have I'm sure increased sales because I can't stop praising it.I highly recommend this product, enough said. :-)"
74290,0,"I bought this for my 2 and 4 year olds for our Disney trip. It is a fabulous design with one flaw. The front seat (for the younger child) is several inches lower than a typical stroller seat. This means that the child's feet are that much lower to the ground. My toddler is 35.5 inches tall and his feet dragged. I was so very disappointed and so was my 4 year old who just loved riding in the back. This is a great stroller, easy to assemble and Amazon's price can't be beat, but just make sure your children will fit. FYI, I took my boys to the store afterwards and checked out the Baby Trend sit 'n stand. Same problem. Not sure why the seat is so low to the ground.PS. Amazon Prime delivered the stroller in 24 hours."
129662,2,"I loved the look of this bassinet and so bought it a few months ago to check it out before my son arrives in July. It is absolutely horrid. The bassinet arrived and the base smelled like toxic paint! The company tried to help me out - they sent me new parts but those weren't sanded down nor were all painted! Then they sent me another set and that set smelled like the first.I finally have decided to return it and go with another company. I did love the basket and the fabric, but would never trust my child in this bassinet.Frankly, after all the smells, I won't buy anything painted from this company."
53444,0,"I received these chairs (I ordered 3), and was optimistic when I took them out of the package, but was so disappointed because they don't fit my round table. If they clear the skirting underneath, they aren't long enough to get the top handles on top of the table, and if I place them outside of the skirting, they are too short to reach the table top. I should have heeded the other reviews! So if I can't find someone to sell them to, I will have to return them. Disappointed, not in the product itself, but that it doesn't fit my pretty standard round table so is worthless to me. Product quality appeared average."
74176,2,"I was so excited about this stroller when I bought it based on all the great review. I am pretty disappointed. Many people have stated their reasons, but I will be redundant and list them again:1. The older child does not have much/any room when the front seat is reclined. When the infant seat is in place, the older child doesn't have much room2. No cup holder! And apparently it is hard to find one that works with this stroller3. The storage basket is pretty much inaccessible! I am a shopper, and the basket is so small I can barely fit my purse into the space to get it in the basket. When the older child is seated, it is innaccessible. I have a heavy purse filled with not only my things, but also my children's! Would be nice to put that thing in the stroller!4. The sun shade is small and will only cover one child. Big problem in the summer!5. The main reason I bought this is because reviews said this was lightweight. Maybe it is more lightweight than other sit and stand strollers, but it is still HEAVY! If I am going to break my back on putting a stroller in and out of the trunk, I would at least like it have some of the other features the Babytrend has!6. It was more expensive than Babytrend, yet I don't see a benefit. Go with the better deal!"
106265,1,"I have never written a review for Amazon but I saw some of the poor reviews on the Diaper Champ and had to add my two cents . . .When my sister got pregnant she could not decide if she should register for the Diaper Champ or the Diaper Genie. She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ . . . The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag . . . My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training, my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her . . .When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system, I put the Diaper Champ on my registry. Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily? True, the mechanism sometimes won't ""swing"" the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag. Yes, it can eventually start to smell if you don't change it regularly . . . but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didn't clean it out regularly . . . Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey . . . my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him :)My personal tip . . . if you belong to a wholesale club like BJ's, Costco or Sam's check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags. The BJ's we shop in has a box of 200 for $9.99. As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazy and don't change the bag regularly) they work perfectly. I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment. I could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way I shop for most things) but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand . . . At about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is ***PRICELESS***."
77960,1,"We are grateful for my wife and I recently made this purchase, the product is convenient and comforting to the baby, arrived in excellent condition to our hands."
104873,0,"I bought them for $5.00 at the baby sale about a year ago and that was fine, but this new price is insane."
61887,1,"So, we've tried Easy Ups and Pull Ups. Here are my conclusions...- Easy Ups work best for average/skinny kids. They're narrower. Pull ups work best for wider kids. My oldest is skinny and he would pee right out of the Pull Ups during his naps or at night time. They were pointless to have on. But he fits in the same size of Easy Ups as diapers he wears. And my wider child would never fit in Easy Ups, but Pull Ups would be perfect.- Tabs shouldn't be on Pull Ups or Easy Ups. If you want tabs, save money and buy diapers! If you want them to feel when they pee, use Gerber training pants. They'll figure it out really quick, and you'll save money.Gerber Three Pack Training PantsGerber Training Pants (6-pairs), 18 Months, Boy's Colors, - Fits 24-28 lbs."
87919,0,I got this as a shower gift.My son has never been interested in it for more than 10 minutes.i don't know why i thought it was a great gift.anyway i returned it and got a swing instead....Babies are different i guess.........
40835,1,"I gave them 4 stars because we do get an occasional leak, but over all I do like them. They don't have that horrible gel that goes all over the baby, and they do stay on well. I have to say I liked the ones we got from Europe (due to production issues they had to import some to keep up with demand) because they weren't scented. Over all these diapers have been easy on my twins' sensitive skin and ususally keep all the mess in."
124580,1,"I wanted to buy the Green Sprouts stacking cups but Amazon offered them w/ free shipping one day and then the next it would be sold by a different vendor without the free shipping. When I saw these stacking cups in the baby store, I put them on my registry instead because they were made w/ safer plastic like the Green Sprouts toys.The label on the learning curve stackers and other products indicate: no PVC, no bpa, and no Phthalates....it's important to me that we have as many safe toys as possible for our baby so I was thrilled to find these.I like this stacking toy because the cups fit nicely in one another and have enough of an edge that they stack nicely on top of one another. They also have tiny holes in the bottom of the cups - each in a different shape as well as numbers on the bottom too.Our daughter is 6 1/2 months old and I put a few of the cups out on the blanket for her to clutch and play with during belly time as well as other toys. Last night she had a cup in each hand and was waving them around. I know she'll like to play with them as she gets older and was glad she already showed an interest in them at this time too."
93283,1,"I purchased this cot mainly for my 4-year-old to use during our summer travels. We stayed at several hotels and a relative's house and I wanted her to have her own space instead of sharing a bed with her 7-year-old brother. I agree with other reviewers on how the strap in the middle is taut and raised slightly, but it doesn't seem to bother my daughter and hopefully over time and with repeated use it will loosen up a bit. I do, however, still bring a small, thin, lightweight comforter with us that I place on the cot first.What I love:-Folds up very quickly and compactly-Light weight-My daughter sleeps comfortably-Durable- both my kids ""forgot"" they weren't supposed to jump on it but the cot has held up fine.-Easy to clean (my daughter vomited on the cot the first time she used it and the sheet and cot itself cleaned up nicely)The only negative thing I can say is that the center strap raised, but since it doesn't affect my daughter's comfort I didn't deduct any stars. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to others!"
50010,0,"we got this carrier because i have a bad back. we have the front carrier which she loves being in. we can't use this one yet because when i put her in it she is still not the 15 pound requirement. so it was too big for her to use yet. she's long but skinny. i am looking forward to trying to use it when she fits in it. but right now it was a dissapointment. if you're looking for something right away, get the snugli front carrier that transforms to the rear carrier as well, it's a great carrier, she loves it, we always carry it with us where ever we go. it's easier to use than a stroller, and i found you can try jeans on in a dressing room with the baby still in the carrier. it's a great thing! i would recommend the snugli.baby e is finally big enough to fit in it, she's now 6 months, and come to find out, wearing it through the store ended up hurting my shoulder. i'm not a big girl, 5'4'' 106 pounds, and my back is horrible. so finding a carrier that won't bother it is quite hard to do. this carrier is not a good one for small people, the straps do not adjust far enough, and when you do adjust the top one, the shoulder pad is no longer on your shoulder, it's on your back where you do not need it to be!! we just ordered a pouch from kangeroo, hopefully that will work, plus the pouch allows you to nurse in public. which is a plus. the good part of the hip hammock was there is a spot for toys to hang, however if your child is anything like mine is with chewing on the straps of the carrier the toy spot is useless. she could care less that her links were haning there, she'd rather suck on the strap of the carrier, which was right in front of her face. i would hold of on this carrier if you could, get one that is a front pack that can turn into the other carriers when the baby grows."
58858,1,"I don't have a dishwasher. I originally registered for the huge electric sterilizer but when I didn't get it at the shower I bought this one intead. It's wonderful. I can sterilize everything in it. Teething rings, bottles, pacifiers, toys, you name it. I have a small kitchen and don't have enough counter space for the huge electric one. This one is small enough to fit in my cabinet. And it's so easy...pile everything in, 200 ml's of water and it keeps things sterile (if unopened) for up to 24 hours. Can't live without it. I LOVE this sterilizer!!"
126055,2,"I've been using Huggies brand diapers in various sizes exclusively for over a year. This is the first time I've ever received a box where at least 1 out of every 5 diapers has one of the velcro tabs missing which makes them unusable. I realize with mass production things can be missed but I've never encountered so many defective diapers in one box. Considering the huge price increase on this item, I'm hopeful this is a one-time occurrence and not something that will become a problem with every order."
40193,1,"I feel like a fool because I told all of the moms I know to get their diapers from Amazon because it was such a great deal. Then I found out they had raised the price three whole dollars between the time I bought diapers and the time my friends went to buy them. Now I look like I don't know what I am talking about.On the other hand, I really like the product. I will warn you that the sizes seem to be a bit off to me. I've been using size 3 since my daughter was about 13 pounds. The size 2s were much too small by that point. So count on them running a little small."
21704,1,"My husband and I love this set. We don't know if we are having a boy or a girl, so we wanted something for either and that could grow with our child. The actual colors and fabrics are much prettier than on the website. We painted the walls a medium blue and two dressers, one yellow and one green to match. We purchased animal knobs at a home improvement center for the dressers. I washed the bumpers with Dreft on delicate cycle and hung to dry, they came out beautifully, it held its shape and there were no rips. I washed and dried the sheet on delicate and had no fading and very few wrinkles. I haven't washed any of the other items yet because they won't be touching the baby. (We are hanging the quilt on the wall for now.) We purchased or registered for many of the coordinating accessories, but we like that we can add almost anything animal theme to the room and it fits in nicely. Everyone tells us how gorgeous the room is and we can't wait for the baby to arrive in a couple of weeks to see how he or she likes it."
179782,1,"This product was a lifesaver when I had to travel cross-country with 2 young kids and just 1 parent. My littlest one was happy to ride through the airport, and I credit this product with allowing us to make a tight connection out of a different terminal. There's no way my toddler's little legs would have been able to keep up.The Travelmate was easy to attach to our Evenflo Generations Booster. The wheels detached easily by releasing the pins, and the entire contraption (booster + Travelmate) fit through the larger sized scanner at a major airport with ease. I had to detach the 2 pieces to fit through the scanner at a smaller regional airport. Although the Travelmate itself is narrow enough to fit down the aircraft's aisle, our booster (and most car seats) are too wide to fit. So to board, I had to let the little one out and carry the seat, which was a bit of a pain. I blame that on the seat, whichI would have had to carry with or without the Travelmate.Attaching the handle only took a minute, and I didn't have any issues with the screws that some users mentioned. However, my packaging had 2 sets of screws, one of which had a note that basically said use these and not the other ones. It seems the manufacturer added these based on feedback.Overall, I was very happy with my purchase. I don't think our trip would have gone so smoothly without it."
162095,2,i bought this tub for my daughter. I had problems with this tub from the beginning. The only good thing about this tub was the sling. It was perfect because her face and ears never got wet. The suction cups would never worked. the plug would never stay in place and water would leaked all over the place creating a mess to clean after bathing her. I only used the tub for two weeks before pitching in the trash. My husband finally bought the safety 1st tub...and it was wonderful.
117163,1,my granddaughters father of the baby coming didnt want to carry a girlie diaper bag so for Christmas we are giving him a camouflaged dude diaper bag to use for his little girl coming. He loved it when i showed it to them on line. It is made of great quality and i like all the pockets that it has including cell phone and bottle carrier. It even has a mat for changing the baby...and my granddaughter will love carrying it if he lets her because she is a tomboy as well. He is in the military so this is perfect.I cant wait to give it to him.
85468,1,This works just fine with my Graco carseat. I've been using it for 5 months and have had no problems!
110968,1,"My son is almost 9 months and he loves going to the bathroom after dinner to wash his hands and brush his teeth just because he isgetting the toothbrush to chew on at the end, he loves it.It is a little bit hard to move it once he chomps on it, but I leave him to do it and he moves it around while he chewsI bought several teething toys for him, and this is the only thing he likes, so even if it just a teether it is totally worth it"
162714,1,Was very pleased with this purchase. It has everything you need for a beautiful nursery and is so pleasing to the eyes!
68116,1,I chose this bedding set before we knew we were having a boy. I painted my son's bedroom yellow (3 walls) and green (one wall) to match the colors in the pattern. It looks so cute! I'm very impressed with the way the valance looks.
165695,1,I absolutely love Pampers baby dry diapers! They are the only diapers that fit my daughter perfectly. She is almost 7 months old now and so far we have not had one 'blow out' with them. We have tried many diapers and these are by far the best! We will never use anything else!!
160380,1,This is one of the best purchases I have made for my toddler. It is SOOOOOO much better than having to empty and clean a little potty chair!!!
28037,1,"This Graco walker does the job. My 6 mos old can get from point A to point B pretty easily. The only complaint I have which I did read in the other reviews is that the toy tray it comes with isn't that entertaining for him. But the upside to that is the toy tray is removable and I can give him his own toys to play with on the tray. Also the back wheels don't turn as well. Overall, I would recommend this product, what you see is what you get!"
54672,1,"No, the mobile is not to put your baby to sleep, but provides visual stimulation and entertainment. Beginning at 5 weeks, I would put my newborn in her crib after changing her morning diaper and I turn on the mobile to entertain her while I get myself ready for the day. She loves it! She kicks, waves her arms, coos and gurgles as she watches the animals spin around. Her tolerance for it is probably only about 10 minutes, then she starts getting overstimulated. But it's become part of our morning routine (I couldn't do without it), and it's fun to watch her get so excited."
105081,1,"When I was pregnant I had 5 women offer to give me their Diaper Genies. They quit using them because it cost too much with the special liners and are apparently hard to dispose of the ""giant snake of diapers"". I declined and searched for something better. This is it! I have only seen the Diaper Champ at Babies R Us and I have been surprised over the last year to never hear of it mentioned in any baby magazine. I can't figure it out becasue it is fantastic. Here's why I love it:1. You use your own bags- any kind you want-(I get the drawstring kind for easy disposal.2. Simply wrap the diaper, place it in the cylinder, and Flip! The weighted cylinder pushes the diaper into the pail and is ready to go.3. When it's full, it is easy to open and if you use drawstring bags, you can cinch the bag as you open the pail and voila!The only down sides are:1. sometimes loose wipes or unfasened tags on the diaper can get caught in the sliding cylinder. You just have to make sure everything is wrapped up. (not too much to ask for a great pail)2. There is odor when you open the pail to remove the bag. This hasn't bothered me because for what I save buying bags at Big Lots I can afford scented bags and I spray the whole unit with Lysol at each bag change-good advice for any pail.Overall- there is no perfect diaper pail but I give this a 5 because it is far superior to any others (and it looks cool too)."
90499,1,"This product is exactly what I wanted: reliable, gentle on skin, quality... and then the cheapest that meet my standards.I've tried most other major brands and I like these the best. Huggies I found too prone to bursting - she pees in it then bounces herself down on the ground, and I have a big mess to clean up. Target brand I felt like were a cheap version of Huggies - same issue but worse and they didn't conform well so they leaked constantly. Luvs were fine for toughness, fair for leaks but she reacted with redness and a rash (though in reality it could have been the Luvs wipes that did it).Pampers are fairly leak free and while they don't burst, they do have those little abosrbent bits that leak through if I don't change it fast enough (like overnight). I've never seen her react to the Pampers diapers. Pampers are nice and thick to absorb even on road trips. The waist band/straps are better than most (both in cut and hold). They contour nicely to minimize leaking - though my girl really likes to overcome even the best plans. ;) To be perfectly honest I'm a Kirkland/Costco kind of a gal and I'll only use the Kirkland wipes. But Pampers and Amazon have pulled me back over. Between the Amazon Mom and Subscribe & Save it's a significant savings.Don't know if I can or should review it separately but the Subscribe & Save is super convenient. I found today I can edit the frequency and even pre-select the next shipment date (for when you have a month and a half supply of a product - not 1 month or 2 month evenly). No complaints so far."
165929,0,"I only use these because I've gotten a huge supply for free. The construction of these diapers seem flimsy compared to Seventh Generation (best diapers) and Huggies Little Movers. Every time my little one pees, they fill up like soggy water balloons. They also smell extra funky when they're peed and of course pooped. I don't mean like just poop, but like poop and artificial scent mixed together. Not a good combo. My little used to get terrible butt rash from Pampers Swaddlers, but these don't give her any rashes. For the price, they're not that bad. I think they are an OK value, just know that there are better options if price isn't the priority."
100395,1,"Good value for me for two reasons. With Amazon Mom and Subscribe & Save discounts, you get lots of diapers for the cash. Also, my little guy had to have most of his colon removed when he was 6mo, which means we have a lot of messy diapers. Pampers keeps the mess in the diaper much better than other brands I have tried. So, they save us from a lot of extra icky laundry and accidents."
87211,1,"I have the 4 oz tub for home, and I keep this in my bag for a touch up or when my pregnant belly itches out of nowhere. So great and so convenient!"
59948,1,"I bought this to replace a smaller bathtub when my baby got too big to bathe in the kitchen sink. It's very sturdy, and holds the baby perfectly in place. A great tub. Takes up a lot of space, though."
57140,1,"Installed the gate in 10 minutes at the top of my stairs. Looks great, feels solid and lock mechanism is childproof. First two visitors that came over climbed over the gate because they couldn't open it. I like the fact that it can stay open if you open it all way or it auto closes if you only open 1/2 way. Excellent product."
182512,1,"My baby skin is very dry and rough especially in the winter. I didn't have any idea what I should put on her skin because I don't want to make her skin more sensitive.I tried a little bit of burt's bee on her cheek once or twice a day. Then in a week, my baby skin is getting better. Her skin is not rough, red or peeled off anymore. It's still bit dry but I think it's normal."
123050,2,"We're just starting to acclimate my 20 mo. old with using the potty. I agree with those who wrote about the oversensitive sensor on the potty chair. Every time my daughter sits on the potty it tells her ""way to go- you did it"" when in fact she hasn't gone at all. I think the toilet paper and flush have definately helped make her fearless about using the regular potty, but when it comes time for serious training, I'm going to have to turn the sound off because it is so misleading. She's had more success the few times she has sat on the regular toilet- this is indeed an expensive toy!"
17194,0,"We received this product at our shower and couldn't wait to use it. We were so disappointed when we finally did!! The reception is so poor, it's ridiculous! Almost every day, we had to adjust and re-adjust it just to get a semi-clear picture. We really gave it a chance because of the peace of mind aspect, to be able to visually see our baby but in the end it was too frustrating for us. I don't think you get your money's worth with this product and I'm astonished that it has received some excellent reviews. I guess if you have the patience and time for constant adjustments then this could work for you. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because we discovered there is another monitor out there that is even worse than this one and more expensive to boot!!!"
9,1,"This dish is good the only problems i have with it are hot tap water won't work as well as very hot water i have a bun coffee maker and i get my hot water from that source this works great, and hole to fill it could stand to be a bit bigger. but overall its a great product"
15196,2,"Since I am not willing to cram my fingers into a poop filled diaper, I am no willing to use this product as planned. The only way I can get the diaper in like they intend is to take a plastic clothes hanger and stuff the diaper in. Doesnt sound too bad? You have to keep a plastic hanger with poop on it somewhere.A friend of ours has a Diaper Champ and I will be purchasing one as soon as possible."
145792,0,"My 7-mon son loved Fisher Price jumperoo (http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-H4328-Fisher-Price-Jumperoo/dp/B0007LD2NE/ref=pd_sbs_ba_37) in his church daycare center so much, so we decided to get one for him at home. We bought this one based on its five star rating score but it turned out not working so well.My son's height and weight are exactly average in his age(50% on the curves) but his feet could barely touch the floor while the three bonjee cords were set at lowest 1st position. If we didn't put a pillow under his feet, he would be 'floating' there with all weight on his waist. As a result, he started to whining after been put in there for about 5 minutes and no joy at all after about 10 minutes.If Amazon could add more detailed description in this item tells us what's the minimum height for a kid to use it, that would be greatly helpful."
44795,2,"I purchased the Radian 65 about a year ago, primarily because it is very narrow, and I need to fit 3 kids in the back of a sedan. If I could fit a wider car seat in the car, I would definitely choose something else. It's easy enough to put together and install. My dislikes are:1) Frayed edges. Some of the stiched edges have frayed and I have to cut off long pieces of thred from time to time.2) Fabric cover does not stay attached to frame. Virtually every day I have to reattach it. It's a pain.3) It's not very comfortable for the kid. The seat sits very upright, so head drooping and bobbing is a definite problem while napping. I can't imagine this would work well for an infant.I've probably owned at least 7 different car seats over time and I find this one to be the most annoying."
76357,2,"We returned it because we really were unhappy with it. Our baby would slip down and it was akward for her to sleep in. We purchased the ""First Years Air Flow"" sleep positioner instead and love it."
126153,0,Besides the great price for an already known brand there is not much to day other that this diapers have been used by both my kids and they seem to do a decent job. Only concern is that it seems that advised weights do not match. My kid is not near 27 pound however previous size won't work anymore.
33421,1,"We bought three and are very pleased. No, these are not a design statement, but neither are the wood versions at or near this price point. They use the same lever bar principle, but the notches are a little more closely spaced than the wood gate we have, which makes for a easier/better fit in the door frame. These are also much more rugged and appear will be durable. These are only 23"" tall which is great for our Pomeranian and can easily be stepped over; a mid-sized dog or a jumper, or an older baby - not sure if this is tall enough.The ""memory"" feature does actually work, as long as you don't put so much pressure on the lever bar such that it bows. The notches allow the metal locking pin to snap into the notch. It does take a bit of force though to push the pin out of the notch once it's in there. But releasing, removing, and replacing the gate in the same opening is a snap. That said, I don't know that I would want to be having to repeatedly change the gate from one location to another because it does require some effort to pull the two panels apart.And of course, a great price. Very good value."
126285,0,"Overall, I was not satisfied with this product. I had to switch to Pampers or huggies supreme. I had used these diapers since my daughter was born in December and was very happy with them until recently. They started to leak when she was asleep. Also, the liners were all stuck together when I received my order. The company did, however, send me coupons for free diapers."
24602,0,"We bought this gates and all seemed great until my husband realized the top doesn't latch. It was completely mounted in the doorway, but there still was a large gap of about 1&quot;. There was no way that the top latch was going to connect with out deliberately bending the entire gate. Has anybody else had this problem? I went back to the store and they all had the same gap and the salesperson said hers from a while back didn't have a gap. HELP!"
122309,1,"This is a great little food processor for making baby food. Easy to use, clean, & is inexpensive. Great product."
67861,1,"I loved the bears and the tassels and the green/pink shades. But the plastic is not white, nor creme, it's an off pink/purple-ish color......which distracts from the great mobile itself. Disappointed, wish it was white or creme."
33224,1,"This is the second natural oak baby gate we have purchased for the same location as we gave the other gate to a friend when we thought we were not going to have anymore grandchildren. This gate has great wood materials and looks very nice in our home as we have natural oak woodwork. The same issues that were prevalent with the first gate are still there. We had to order a second gate the first time due to some crooked spindles. That was not necessary this time. The company still packages the product too soon as the varnish interacts with the styrofoam and causes some finish damage/roughness on the spindles that touch the styrofoam. The ends of the wood wall attachments still come discolored and rough due to some interaction with what they come against when they are finished. The small 6x1/2 screws are even more deficient now than they were before. During the first insallation 5 years ago, the heads broke off and I had to drill larger pilot holes and use my own screws. This time, the screws had flat ends, not wood screws, and had to be replaced as before. This time the hanging hardware and large screws were just zinc plated and do not have the brass look as the previous gates hardware had. That is a step backwards in my opinion. Even with the deficiencies noted, I still think it is the nicest looking gate available in a reasonable price range. We do have some fun with the opening mechnism as not only is it child-proof, it is almost adult-proof, but with some training, they eventually get it."
74588,2,"Really cute, but cleaning concerns me. The paint (?) comes off easily just with water and a paper towel. Any little scrubbing causes scratches in the picture. I am concerned that this paint may come off on foods my son was eating. We have only used a few months, if that, and are now moving on to a a different placemat"
143739,1,I live in germany so it usally always snowing or raining so this seat cover proved to be worth while. we take it every were with us keeps the baby warm and happy.
20007,2,These bowls look great but don't buy them if you want bowls that actually stick and stay put!
89843,1,"I've always had concerns about leakage during the night time. Pampers baby dry completely resolved this matter. No leakage, no odors, and soft linings~!"
6429,0,"These are not 5 star sheets. I bought these sheets based on the great reviews and they are NOT soft. The color is a pretty bubblegum pink which matches my daughter's bedroom, however I do not like the quality. I would not purchase these again and they are not worth the money. What I do love is the fitted sheets and comforter, which is unique."
55954,1,"Like this item a lot, auto shut off, any size/brand of bottle can be heated on this item, even baby foods. The only thing that makes this rate a little less than perfection is because you have to wait 10mins before you can use it again. Sometimes i miss to calculate the milk i am heating for (still cold), 10mins seems like forever waiting especially when your baby is so cranky dying for her milk."
27291,1,"This product was recommended to me by my sister-in-law after I complained about how difficult it was to change the crib sheet. This mattress pad is the number one, it's a time saver and no need to by multiple crib sheets if using this mattress pad.It has been a real time saver when my daughter had an accident or got sick in the night, I just unsnapped the soiled pad and either replaced it with a clean pad or left her sleep on the sheet that was underneath. I highly recommend this product to anyone who doesn't feel like struggling to change the crib sheet."
160130,1,This blanket makes swaddling a piece of cake! My baby is unable to undo this swaddle unlike regular blankets! It helps her feel secure and I used this to assist in getting my baby to sleep alone in her own crib!
13983,2,I used the slowest flow nipple and my baby had formula spurting out the sides of her mouth! Also these were very bubbly! I switched to the Playtex Disposable System and have no problems ever since. Do yourself a favor and don't buy too many of any bottle until you find one that works for your baby.
28347,1,"You can spend a thousand dollars on a glider, if you want... but you don't have to. This one works well, and is a fraction of the price. We've been using ours non-stop for five months -- I sit in it for HOURS every day -- and it's held up well. No squeaks or loose screws, etc. and it was easy to assemble; my DH did it in about 20 minutes.Yes, the seat cushion is a bit thin, but I added a basic foam seat cushion ($1 from IKEA) on top, and now it's quite comfortable, even when I'm up with baby in the middle of the night. I was also able to use this chair with a breast-feeding pillow.My only real complaint is that the arm padding doesn't cover the whole chair arm. At the very front, about one-half inch of the wood frame is exposed, which makes me worry about bumping baby's head against it. My fix for this problem was simple: I just draped some towels over the arms. Not pretty, but they do help absorb the inevitable milk spillage and keep the upholstery looking nicer!I know that some reviewers have said that this chair is too small. For what it's worth, that hasn't been a problem for me (I am 5'4"" and a size 6/8). However, my friend T (who is a fit 5'10"") also has this exact same glider, and she loves it.Overall, this glider and ottoman are a good deal, especially for the price! If you are going to splurge on baby-related purchases, skip the fancy glider and use the $$ to get a postpartum night nurse instead! ;)"
90569,0,"I have a 12 year old that I religiouly used pampers brand diapers on, now that I have another baby I am surprise to find out that the quality has change for the worse. Simply put their quality is not what it used to be."
43783,1,"I bought the First Years On-The-Go Booster seat for my parents to use when they babysit my nine-month-old son. It is everything the other reviewers say it is. It is an excellent purchase. My wiggly 21-pound baby is very secure in it, and the booster places him at just the right height with the dining table. The seat is easy to use and folds to a very compact box when we don't need it."
71895,1,"I was so excited to finally get my hands on a great stoller with a nice clean cut look.......until I opened the box. I ordered the maroon stroller, and that is what I recieved in the box. The only thing is that I thought the child's seat was going to be white just like the picture. Well, silly me because of course nothing you order online is exactly what you get. The seat in the maroon stroller is actually a deep green. You have to order a padded insert that is $50 to get the white seat look. I emailed amazon and they just said I can return the item and that they were not responsible for the misleading picture. Other than that I love the stroller. It seems really sturdy. I had to adjust the front wheel a few times in order to make it go straight. Since I have been able to get past the color scheme that they have, I absolutley think this stroller is worth the money. I only gave it 4 stars because of the slight problem I had with the colors. Overall...highly remcommended!!!!"
55351,2,"My husband purchased this product, wanting to keep our leather seats clean. When I had my carseat professionally installed, the installer showed me how the carseat slips more easily with this soft undermat on the leather. She said that the seat would never be a tightly installed with a flexible undermat and therefore this product is not recommended as being safe."
57437,1,"my grandson just loves being in his new bouncer, he sleeps so well in it that my dauhgter-inlaw can get things done around the house"
131746,1,These are the only bottles my daughter will take at daycare. She loves them! We tried lots if others but these truly mimic the breast.
74648,1,"The walker is just as the description says it is. It took my now 8 month old daughter a little while to get used to it, but now she loves it! She has discovered the freedom of ""faster travel."""
84964,1,We tried several other cups before this one and my breastfed baby would not take to any of them (He also would not take a bottle of any kind). The first time I gave him this cup he drank like he had been using a cup for months. I highly recommend it.
129740,2,"Cheap, soft wood, worst packaging ever. Assembled bed looks like a doll's bed, should be sold as a toy, in a package to Barby, as accessory. Worst product ever. Bad for US - good for China.Stork Craft Soom Soom Toddler Bed, Natural"
51185,0,"My chiropractor recommended I get a body pillow because I'm a stomach sleeper, and a pregnant friend recommended this one.It's nice and long, and was a good firmness when I got it. But in a few weeks, the stuffing began to clump up awkwardly, and the unlined zipper got stuck in the stuffing when I tried to redistribute it, so now it doesn't open all the way. It's hard to shift the pillow's position without getting out of bed entirely, which is really annoying, and it took me just a few days to rip the thin fabric while trying to move the bottom curved part around with my feet in the middle of the night.I can see a pregnant woman, who can't shift position a lot, using it for a few weeks or months. But for long term use, or use by restless sleepers, the quality just isn't high enough."
124778,2,"I have twins and they received these walkers for their first Christmas. We were very excited about these walkers and like the idea they could use them together. We soon discovered these toys have a bad design and are potentially extremely dangerous. Both of my girls had the same thing happen, they would be trying to walk behind the toy pushing the handle and their pants would get caught under a wheel. This causes them to trip and their necks would get stuck on the handle bar. Since their feet were stuck, they wouldn't move their head started to choke. These are a neat idea, but major design error."
63320,1,"Say this at my child's day care and loved it so much I bought it. Although, I think I enjoy playing with it more than my 5 month old."
103885,0,We bought this item because of all the great reviews. The good news is that it eliminates all the white noise and static that we hated. I also love the two way walkie talkie feature. The bad news is that it reduces the volume so I can't hear my two year old daughter when she calls me after waking up from her nap. We have the volume control and sensitivity set on maximum. I would not be confident using this for a new born.
21379,2,It is held together with a bungee cord that ripped apart in less than a week! with a 62 pound boy jumping on it. It is rated to 77 lbs. Don't believe it. It is not made to last AT ALL. Stay away unless you want it for a 2 year old... horror show!
89537,1,Usage of diapers depend on mom's preference/ child's skin. Personally I feel Pampers is great and I dont think we can get it any cheaper than Amazon
72239,2,it was very easy to put together but my 7 month old isnt very entertained by the table he wants to get out of it after less than 5 monutes and I only had this toy for a week. If you have carpet I wouldnt recommend it its hard for it to rotate. I only give it 2 stars because it was simple to put together but as far as the toys on the table to entertain a child they could of been better.
8537,1,"I was looking for some protective material to mostly cover a lot of corners, but didn't want to spend a lot of money.This stuff works great, I cut it up into about 1 inch pieces, put on a couple of pieces of the double adhesive tape, and then put it onto a corner. While you get a few corner pieces with the kit, this way you can protect as many corners as you need to."
36316,1,"I bought this diaper bag, first, because it matched the betsy stroller my daughter-in-law received at her baby shower. But once I got it,I loved it. It's very roomy on the inside and comes with a smaller bag for extra things, which I love. Because when I have the baby over and take her out with me I like to have everything I could possibly need for her in my bag. And these bags allow me to do that. I am very happy that I made this purchase."
112850,2,"These diapers are awful. The material is stiff and bulky and the size range is ridiculous. They are for 6-14 lbs, When my baby was 6lbs these diapers were bigger than his entire body. They finally fit now that he is 4 months. The tape on these diapers also get stuck on the baby's skin. And finally they don't deal well with leaks. If you are looking for a more environmentally friendly diaper check out the seventh generation diapers."
123888,0,"This car seat is very easy to install and is very comfortable for my son. The only thing I don't like about it stands so erect that is difficult for the child to sleep in it very comfortably. Also, there is no padding on the each side of the head rest to keep the child's head from flopping about."
159619,1,"We got this for our daughter when she was an infant (now she's 3yrs old) She loved it. The fishes are cute, she loved the lights and sound too. This bouncer was the best. I gave it to my friend for her infant once my daughter got older. Ver nice bouncer."
63068,1,"Thank you all for your review on calling Medela @ 1-800-435-8316. I simply told them that I needed more tubing for my Pump in Style Advanced, all they did was ask for my address and they said I should receive it free of charge (courtesy) in 6 days. No questions asked...Thanks everyone!"
54057,0,"First, the clip on mine doesn't hold and keeps coming unclipped. Then I got a new car that doesn't have a headrest in the middle so there is nothing to attach it to. The little velcro doesn't hold it and it keeps falling on the baby. I like the size of this one and once I get it adjusted, I can see her fine. It just doesn't stay put for very long. One bump and it comes crashing down. I am looking for something else."
79363,1,Wonderful product and the customer service was excellent. Very friendly--I highly recommend Touch of Europe products to everyone!
125744,1,"This is a good-quality book with lots of pages to fill in info and put pictures. The inside pages are pretty plain- no decorations, but you can really make it look nice. I'm happy with this purchase and recommend the product."
72079,1,"We decided to convert the Da Vinci Kalani from a crib to a full sized bed and ordered the rails (white kit) from Amazon.Rails were delivered within two days and looks great. In some ways, I expected more for the price rather than two wooden side bars and bolts. I knew that the kit would come with no slats but it would have been nice if Kalani (MDB) had designed the crib so that it could accommodate a mid beam and include that with the the kit.Fixing the rails is relatively straightforward. Requires a bit of dis-assembly but 30 mins or so and I had the crib converted to the full size bed frame. My wife and I read to our son before he goes to bed so it was imperative that we get some slats or a box spring to support our weight.First stop was the local Ikea store to see if I could get slats for the frame but unfortunately all the full sized slats require a beam in the middle so it was a no go. I decided to get a little creative and went to Home depot and got 8 1x3"" boards and had them cut it down to the exact width (52 1/4""). This leaves a 1/4"" gap to the side rails. Next, I ordered ~10 yards of 1"" white nylon ribbon from Amazon and used a staple gun to staple the wooden slats at 9"" intervals on both sides. The idea was this will keep the slats from sliding outwards on the frame. For the first and last slats, I nailed in plastic spacers to prevent the slats/nylon ribbon from compressing towards the center. The whole assembly is now quite taut and hopefully work well. Total cost for the slats + nylon assembly ~$40. I have added a couple of images."
149043,1,This pillow is great. I'm 30 weeks preggo right now and will probably continue to use this pillow long after baby is born. I'm 5'6 and a plus size gal and I feel like this pillow fits me perfectly.
117428,1,Does a good job of keeping little ones from taking off from the table. It's very portable and we've used it just about everywhere. The only difficulty we've encountered is pulling the bands to the right tightness while our daughter is trying to wriggle out of it. Loses a star for that...
162271,0,"The color is beautiful, dark black. Easy to put together, but the bottom drawer is warped and does not fully push in."
182181,1,"Pros- easy to use, to get your baby in & out of it- ""active"" part (support for your lower back) really works, I'm 6,10"" and it's perfect. My wife is 5.8"" and she's happy with it too.- easy to adjust the belts- great for kids up to 6months- looks greatCons- when baby is facing forward and you fold down the ""neck support"" part, it the edge comes exactly where our baby's mouth is, so he keeps chewing it.... He's now 5 months and this problem will disappear as he gets bigger I think.We have it in this color, bought it here on Amazon for $100, got it within 4 days."
30650,2,This monitor has so much static and loses its connection so frequently (and then beeps loudly) that we sometimes just turn it off and have no monitor at all! So frustrating. It charges ALL DAY and still only gives us about an hour of time before it shuts off - insane! It has never worked properly and I wish I could return it but it was a gift. Very disappointing.
45994,1,"From the time the twins were about 3 weeks old, they enjoyed the mobile immensely. They were born 3 weeks early so I am sure this could be used from birth. From 3 weeks to 3 months they liked the black/white/red cards with patterns on them. We placed the most simple cards facing the bottom initially and flipped them around 1.5 months. What made this mobile great for us was that we obtained a rotating motor (which had music) and plastic stand from another mobile set, and attached the stim mobile onto the motor so that it spins the cards around and around. This made it 10x more fun for the babies as they learned how to track across the midline with their eyes at a very early age.We placed the mobile low enough (using the extenders that came with the set) so they could bat at them. When the mobile spins, they are able to increase their hand-eye coordination ability. By 3 months they had developed pincer grasp skills and were able to use their thumb and forefinger to grab the cards by their edges as they spun by.Here is a video of the mobile spinning on a motor:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkFRC0_9JyY&feature;=share&noredirect;=1After 3 months, we transitioned them to the more advanced colored picture cards. But they got so strong that they could pull the mobile down if they were allowed to grab the cards. So at this point we raised the mobile away from them. One of the twins likes to kick the cards with her feet, which helps to develop awareness of their lower extremities as well as coordination.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sLdI34gwSEIn this video the girl twin is paying more attention to the camera so she doesn't seem as interested as she usually is. We didn't have the motor attached here, but at least one of them seems to be fascinated by it.I actually like that the cards and the frame are light because having heavy objects suspended over the babies make me nervous."
1637,2,"BEWARE!!! Just because the box looks like Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max Diapers, these are NOT the same. My son is now 5 mo. old and we've been using Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max diapers since he was born (you know, with the blue wetness indicator on the front). However, these are NOT Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max. These are thinner, do not have the woven material inside the diaper and are not nearly as absorbent as the Swaddlers. My son has leaked out of his diaper the last 5 nights... these diapers simply are not absorbent enough to contain a night's worth of pee. We rarely had this problem with Dry Max. I won't be buying these again- they simply aren't worth the very little cost savings."
145470,1,"At first I thought his legs were too short but as he sat in it a few times, the springs settled down so I was able to take away the box I put there so his feet could touch a solid object.He loves it, he gets all crazy bouncing and laughing.You do have to watch his fingers, if he leans forward and puts his hand by one of the supports and then bounces it could get caught between the support legs but so far it has not happened.It would have been nice if UPS knocked on my door rather than just leaving it outside. It could have been stolen !"
141736,0,"I bought this for my 10 months baby. He likes the music, lights and sounds, but this toy does not give the support for a pre-walker. Other minus is that to hear the animals sounds you have to press many times the key. For a little boy it would be more atractive to press the key and hear the animal immediatly"
155607,1,I cannot say how much I love this product. My daughter potty trained at 24 months and the idea of her using public toilets just grosses me out! The seat collapses flat and fits inside a thick plastic storage bag. The replacement bags are compact and the travel bag can fit many. The seat itself is quite thin so I can't imagine it being super comfortable but my daughter is on and off so quickly that it doesn't seem to matter. The pee is absorbed quickly and we've never had leaking issues.The downside is that the seat itself is small so larger children won't fit for very long. My daughter is tall but slender and has no problems.The replacement bags are $5.00 for 10 which is a little pricey for what it is but I don't mind paying 50 cents a go if it means she doesn't have to deal with a public toilet. I keep kleenex in the car so we use that as toilet paper or portable wet wipes if she poops.The only thing I can say need improvements would be to make the seat a little larger (width wise) and then make the rim that the child sits on larger.
144875,1,"This wall border provided the finishing touch for our baby's nursery which has all of the other Blossoms bedding and accessories. We applied the border to a painted wall, and not realizing that the border comes pre-pasted, we had already bought some wall paper paste. Lucky for us that we did, as we found that when the border was up, there were areas where the border was coming away from the wall because of lack of paste. I am sure this is not a fault if the product, but probably down to our lack of experience hanging pre-pasted wall paper. So if you are not an expert at hanging wall paper, I would make sure that you have a pot of wall paper paste and a small brush handy.Other than this, we really like the product which we feel has excellent quality."
54177,1,"This mobile is GREAT. Our son loves the bright colors and the small pieces that slide and make a little noise help keep his attention. He will lie for the entire time it runs and coo at it. We like the music and the colors and you can remove the mobile and just keep the music box in the crib when baby is older. We haven't gone thru a ton of batteries either, which is nice!"
100520,1,"Its the only brand I use and I love buying it in economy packages, you cant beat the price."
68416,1,"The price is a bit high considering it is an easy design, but if I remember correctly it is a small business that a woman started on her own, so I don't mind supporting that. I received this before my son was born over four years ago, and since he was born, I've used it every single day. I don't like having a diaper bag with me most of the time; I just stash things into my purse or regular bag. This pouch holds a travel wipes container and a handful of diapers (right now we have five in there). I do wish it was a tiny bit bigger, but again, what I like most is it's ease of use and the fact that it is NOT a big, bulky pouch or container. Sometimes it is the only thing my husband and I have brought out with the kids. We throw it in the car, in the stroller, whatever."
103736,1,I bought extra pump parts for my Pump in Style pump. I love my pump and it's nice to have extra parts.
100732,2,"I tried to save a buck and get the baby dry instead of my usual swaddlers.....Big mistake, I have ruined a bunch of outfits because #2 rides up the back of these.Penny wise pound foolish, spend the extra few bucks and get the swaddlers."
164736,1,"Delivery of the diapers was sooner than stated on billing form. The price is also great-cheaper then anywhere else that I checked. I like the fact that there is no shipping charge because of the ""free shipping over $25."" Thanks Amazon, I'll be ordering diapers again."
122156,2,"When I put this carrier on, I felt like I was going backpacking in the Amazon or something. It was uncomfortable and I just couldn't take having to adjust all those straps. The material is a bit rough too. My husband is tall and bigger, and after I finally had the carrier adjusted to me, he then had to readjust it for himself. We ended up trying many different carriers on at Target and the most comfortable one was the Bjorn...Sad to say, because it's so $$$. We ended up returning this one and getting a used Bjorn on EBAY. When I got it, it looked practically new. You don't use a carrier for very long and so getting the used one and it being the BEST and most comfortable... I was thrilled with my ebay purchase."
52543,1,"I BOUGHT THIS SWING FOR OUR DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS A FEW WEEKS OLD SHE LOVED IT FROM THE START SHE SLEEPS IN IT ALL THE TIME SHE LOVES THE LIGHTS AND THE MUSIC, INFACT SHE LOVES IT SO MUCH I PUT THE SWING NEXT TO HER CRIB SO SHE CAN HERE THE MUSIC WHILE SHE GOES TO SLEEP, IT INSTANTLY PUTS HER OUT. I READ THE REVIEW ABOUT BABY HAVING HAD THEIR HEAD STUCK I LOOKED AT THE SWING AND CANT SEE HOW IT HAPPEND, SHE SITS IN IT AND HER HEAD GOS TO THE SIDE BUT THERE SEEMS NO WAY FOR HER HEAD TO GET EVEN A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TO GETTING STUCK, THAT BABY MUST HAVE BEEN TO BIG OR TO OLD TO EVEN BE IN THE SWING, IT IS VERY STURDY, AND RECLINES PLENTY THE MUSIC IS A PERFECT LOUDNES AND AS FAR AS HITTING THEIR HEAD WHILE GETTING HER OUT YOU JUST NEED TO GENTLY LIFT THEM OUT I HAVE NEVER HIT HER HEAD ON IT YET, I THINK THIS SWING IS WORTH THE MONEY ITS A GREAT SWING...EMMAS MOM.."
35678,2,"I keep looking but I can not find a safe car seat cover anywhere that is warm. I wish manufacturers would make them so people who car about their child's safety will buy one. Anything that goes between the child and the carseat should not be used as it can interfere with the car seats safety, the bottom part of this goes between the child and the car seat and therefore this product should not be bought.I am still in search of a warm car seat cover that meets these standards."
77463,1,"I bought this swing when my baby was about 6 weeks old because she was my third and sometimes I had a hard time setting her down somewhere I could see here, where she would be comfortable and I could do other things around the house. After buying it I have to say I dont know why I didnt get it sooner! My daughter is now 8 weeks old and she LOVES her swing! She is starting to become interested in the moving mobile and the light stars. I also like the fact that you can choose to have the swing sway side to side or back to front. It was very easy to assemble ( I did it myself!) and it comes with a power cord so I dont have to bother with batteries. I would definately recommend this swing!"
62205,2,"The idea is great, but it just doesn't work. The sides that snap closed to keep the pacifier clean dig into my baby's cheeks. It doesn't always close before it hits the floor, either. It was disappointing."
92648,0,"These are perfect for our mirror closet sliders, but they break so easily--be sure to buy them by the dozen!"
16581,1,"This bib is absolutely gorgeous. I received this item at my baby shower, after putting it on my registry, thinking it was overpriced and never thinking anyone would pay this money. Well I received two bibs and a set of burp cloths and I can't wait to use them. I'm going to buy some myself."
141152,1,I bought this for my granddaughter when she was four months old. She would sit in my lap and we would play with it together. She would push the different buttoms and would be entertained for hours. This toy grew with her. The older she got the more use she got out of it. She is now two and is still playing with this toy. I have never seen a toy get so much use from such a young age. I would recommend this toy with anyone with a small child. Best for ages 6 months to 2 years.
62623,2,"I've had the diaper genie for a year now and I'm ready to review. The first 5 months the genie did well. I found it easy to use and it did contain the stink from my daughter's diapers. Then, well, she started solids and the genie started smelling REALLY bad. Like port-o-john on a hot day bad. I used Lysol to clean it twice a week and let it airdry, but it didn't help. The lid also broke off. I wouldn't suggest anyone purchase this unless they plan on buying another one every 2-3 months."
136168,2,"Well, my baby girl just doesn't seem to like this toy. I started putting her in it at 5 months (after she had very good head control) but it ususally ended in crying. It's a little difficult to get the baby's legs through the seat. Now at 8 months's she's still not too interested. She likes her jumperoo, but just really doesn't seem too interested in this exersaucer. I'd have to agree with another's review that the sounds are either too loud or too soft. This toy either gives you a big headache or else you can't hear the noises at all. For the money I'd have to say I am a little disappointed."
146690,1,"We bought this for our son when he was about 4 months, around the same age our other friends' kids started enjoying their jumpers, but he refused to like it until he turned 6 months. Then magically, one day, it was all he wanted to do.Baby likes it because:-it has exciting, upbeat music-lots of touchy feely toys-dangling toys for him to look up at-it swivels so he doesn't get bored looking at the same thing the entire timeWe like it because:-baby is entertained for 20-30 minutes so we can get things done around the house-the seat comes out easily for washing-the music is catchy and fun but it doesn't get stuck in your head like some toys :)-height adjusts easily and has three settings for growthThe only thing I don't care for is that it doesn't fit through most standard door frames when all assembled. You have to break it down to move it from room to room, which isn't so bad, but not entirely convenient."
32076,0,"this item is great for holding things that otherwise would most likely be rolling around on the floor of my car, but it is not put together very well. after having it about 2 weeks, my son was kicking at it with his feet and the stitching on the pouch came undone. it was like, all you had to do was pull on it and it came right off. things that are made to be around kids need to be more durable."
57212,0,"QualityThe fabric components of this stroller are very resistant to snags & tears. The canopy (both sides on a double are connected) , under basket, seats, & grab bar are all removable. Snaps, parent's handlebar, frame, foot rests & seat supports are high quality - comparable to a BOB. I do have, however, 4 issues:1)The storage basket underneath is easy to get caught & start to bend when folding. As long as I'm watching out for this problem, I can prevent it entirely.2)The kid's grab bar can't stand the test of time- or cold weather. I had 3 - yes THREE - strollers arrive broken where the grab bar inserts (a plastic socket integral to the frame, & thus not easily repaired or replaced). The company points out that though the grab bar is nice - it doesn't affect the real use of the stroller. A note here - UPS was responsible for at least two of these breakages, as the 3rd & 4th strollers send to me were personally double-inspected before shipment.3)The pin to lock the swivel wheels seems to be a weak point. I had different problems with this on two of the four strollers I've now experienced.4)The second of the four strollers sent to me came with a used tire! & it didn't even fit on the frame!AvailabilityI ordered my ""in stock"" stroller, & after 2 months of waiting I canceled. Later, I ordered again from another website & received my stroller. One word here - the replacements (3 of them after the 1st was defective) took a total of 4 months to play out.Customer SupportOkay, here is a shining star amidst the many problems I had. Each time I had a problem, the company was fully on my side to get it resolved. In the end I am satisfied with how they have compensated me.Product DevelopmentThe very best change they have made is to the buckle! Now it comes with a pinch-free system where both sides of the harness snap into the same piece, & unsnap with one step. Trust me - it's much better than the pictures.Also: The nozzle where you attach your bike pump now sticks out far enough from the tire rims to use a travel-size pump.Ease of StrollingFor all my complaining, the advertised product is still a fantastic stroller!!! I would still recommend it. It truly does go through snow, over bumps, around shopping carts. The seats recline very deeply or sit up high & with good support for your kids' backs & bums. They are also high off the ground & easy for me to buckle my kids. &, you can buy a car seat adapter.SizeDon't expect a tiny stroller. If you want ultra light-weight & don't really care a sturdy frame, go with a Combi twin savvy. The trax360 is one of the lightest double joggers. My tall 4 yr old fits still. It fit in the back of a trailblazer-barely. It is still heavy but not near as heavy as the BOB duallie.ConclusionIf ALL of this happened to one customer - what else is going on? Just so you know, the company has refunded my purchase price (not including shipping), & I get to keep the 4th defective stroller. Apparently I am a rare, if not unique, case & you should not expect to get a refund unless you've got a really good reason."
24929,1,"I love this gate! Once I bought it, I didn't want any other kind of baby gate in the house. It's a dream to operate when your hands are full, just step on the mechanism and knee it open, instead of fumbling with tricky latches or buttons. I especially love the ramp over the bottom bar, prevents tripping and stumbling. It is also very sturdy, when properly installed and tightened, my daughter has tried to shake it as hard as she can but it always stands solid. I really can't praise it enough, it's the best baby gate I have ever used or seen."
3542,1,"This model is a very practical and functional carseat. We were a bit worried about the colour would be too dull, now actually feeling satisfied for its very classy colour and high quality fabric! We're pretty sure that this is better than lots expensive others. Would recommed it to our friends."
145592,1,"This items was purchased as a Christmas, I know I'm early. But my daughter has one for her daughter so I know that my other grandaughter will enjoy."
10594,1,"These for cloth diapering? Um, no way. Way too thin for that. These for burp cloths? Absolutely! While I still periodically reach for the pretty and colorful burp cloths that are specifically made for that use, they are not nearly as absorbent as these Gerber cloth diapers. My child is not even all that prone to throwing up and the other burp cloths are still not enough... I cannot imagine how often you would have to reach for a 2nd, 3rd and 4th burp cloth if you had a baby who spit up all the time. These are easily washed and inexpensive... admittedly not as pretty, but most mothers get over ""pretty"" real quick when real life sets in and baby becomes messy all of the time! lol"
39535,1,"Excellent product. She can't kick it off like a normal blanket. Love how the zipper zips up from the bottom, making night time diaper changes a breeze. The fleece is soft and warm, sometimes too warm. If you buy one, it wouldn't hurt to buy the fleece one AND a cotton one for warmer nights."
41309,1,"Best diapers out there -- pricey, but cannot be beaten when it comes to no leaks."
5193,0,"Buy a size up. Yes it keeps the diaper rash at bay (Lasinoh Wipes and Dr Smiths Diaper Cream keep the rash away with ANY diaper, promise)... But, I am not longer going to use these diapers. One, they are two cents more each than Pampers. Two, my daughter is breastfed.. and these diapers can't seem to really keep the poop and pee from leaking out. I'm pretty adamant about changing her, so its the diapers, not me lol.The fit is weird. The product doesn't have wings on the velcros so the straps dig into my daughters sides a little. I don't know, they just didn't work for us. I love that their odorless, but will gladly go back to the wreak parfum of pampers to avoid blowouts and leaks.I wish these diapers and my baby could of had a better relationship."
178208,1,"My friends and I have tried all brands of milk storage bags and agree that these are the best.Lansinoh bags have 2 ziplock strips at the top and are quite a bit thicker than Gerber bags. Both are self-standing, but when you freeze them standing up, you get a sphere of frozen breastmilk at the bottom of the bag.I freeze all of my Lansinoh bags laying flat. They are easier to store and, with a larger surface area for the milk, freeze quicker and more evenly. With a flat pouch of milk it's easy to flip through a bunch and pick out the appropriate bag to defrost.I never even tried the Medela CSF bags as there's no ziplock (just twist-ties) and, thus, no way to freeze flat. My friends have tried them and prefer the Lansinoh."
42483,1,"I love this baby carrier. I bought one for my second child. It is the best one out there. When I put it on I feel like I am pregnant again. lol I can do what I have too and my baby is comfortable. (usually asleep) I love that I can chase my 4 year old in the store and not have to worry about my baby in the cart or stroller. It is so COMFORTABLE FOR ME! Three of my friends have it too and they love it!YOU CAN WASH IT! Take it anywhere!You can even wear it without the baby like in the car, so you don't have to put it on at the store."
21497,2,"First the positive -- the brown cushions fit our coffee table perfectly, will definitely protect our lil one from injury, also they are aesthetically pleasing.However, the tape is completely horrible and considering you need the cushions to stay on --this is a significant issue. Both my husband and I messed with the tape for nearly an hour before we were able to get it to stick, and even now, I am fairly certain that my daughter will be able to rip these off."
57170,1,"I own two of these bronze gates purchased from a hardware store and they don't sell this color anymore. Happened to find this on Amazon and going to buy two more gates. Great functionality, color and price!"
122430,1,These stars are better than I thought they were going to be. With all the different sizes of stars it looks like they are 3-D. It is incredible. I put half up in my sons room & the other half in my younger sons room. Now I think I am going to buy a set for my room.
112936,0,"For the price of the dresser, I should have just gone to an actual furniture store. The dresser took a few hours to put together, and then it was sort of disappointing. One of the drawers doesn't exactly fit. I am using it for a baby nursery and the color matches the crib almost perfectly."
85734,1,This was perfect for what I was looking for. Easy to put together. Very simple. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a changing table.
151889,1,"These boor locks really do work.I have forgotten they were on there, and giving the door a pretty hard tug to open it they stayed in place like a champ. My 2 year old has wanted into the closet a few times, tried to let himself in and they didn't give. I just wish all baby products worked like they are suppossed to as well as these do!"
173265,1,Sturdy and does the job. Not flimsy like other seat protectors that we've owned. Keeps my seats from getting marked up by the car seat. Kick pad below is also helpful.
45499,1,This is the greatest from about 3 months up. Our daughter is 7 months and it is still one of her favorites. We have now removed the lights and music panel from it(just lift up the velcro) since she is mobile and kept rolling on it and kicking the plastic parts. It is such a great activity mat. It is worth the little extra for it!
135600,1,"My daughter actually picked this one out, she really wanted pink. Other than that the cupholders are convenient for her ""treasure"" and sippy cups. Other cups we have to be careful with for fear they will spill out. Overall it functions very well and very easy to change between cars."
72802,0,"This thermometer was great, because the numbers were readable (as they are on top of the toy and not in the water) and I loved how it blinked green for good temp and red for too hot. However, this only last about a month and you can't replace the batteries. We had to throw it away.. what a waste!"
79087,1,"These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take and she LOVES them. The Wal-Mart in our area stopped carrying them and I couldn't find them anywhere. We were getting desperate as our daughter will NOT sleep if she doesn't have one. I ordered 2 packs so I would have extra and wouldn't have to worry about running out again. I love the product and the price was great, but they get you on the shipping. I paid almost $10 for standard shipping for two packs in a small enveloped package. I thought that was ridiculous. Otherwise, very pleased."
62844,0,"We have had the Diaper Genie since our daughter was about 3 months old (she's now 17 months). I like that it controls odor as well as can be expected for stinky diapers and that it is easy to change the refills. The problem I see with this diaper disposal system is that 1) the film refills are expensive and 2) upon changing the refill, you have a problem getting the first couple types to stay sealed individually in their twisted film. We have tried several different methods of starting the new film, but still have the problem that when the first diaper (or first couple diapers) are inserted and you twist the film to seal it, the next diaper is then inserted and falls into the supposedly sealed first diaper roll. It's very frustrating and we have yet to come up with a solution. Should we decide to purchase a new diaper disposal system for our new baby, I will certainly invest in a differest system."
12131,0,"I am in my third trimester, but I bought this pillow in the second trimester, and it has already flattened a bit. I still use it however, as it still provides some much needed support for my poor flopped over belly! I would definitely reccomend getting two (since the price is right) so you can really wedge yourself up or sit on during the day (boy that feels good too if your sciatic nerve is hurting your hip or back during pregnancy.)"
141084,1,"The sit to stand walker came promptly after ordering it, my granddaughter loves it because of all the colors and things to play with. For the price theproduct is well made and the company uses excellent material so I don't have to worry about it breaking and my granddaughter getting a piece that is small enough to put in her mouth! Great product VTech I will be looking at your products the next time I need a gift. Thanks! Cindy"
8745,1,"We've had one for 1.5 years and it still looks brand new. It is used every day at least once. My 3 year old likes to get it down and use it in front of the tv, too. Now my 1 yr old is getting it down for himself, so I am buying a second one for him. Great product."
128252,2,"From the picture this looks like it's a solid wood toy chest. Not so, the top is completely hollow and cannot support any significant weight. The only solid wood pieces are the edges and cross beams. Overall it's an OK piece of furniture for the price but don't be fooled by the picture, we were."
5501,1,This is exactly what I was looking for. Only thing I don't like is that using a garbage bag or grocery bag as a liner doesn't work well if you want to keep the lid closed. It needs a little extra height from the hinge seam to fold the bag over. Otherwise great.
18868,1,"I've had one of these booster seats for years. This design has worked so well for our growing family, I'm looking for another. I've used this seat for three children now and need another to accomodate a fourth child. I'm not sure I've ever used the tray. I just push my boys right up to the table. I particularly like the fact that is has three height levels. The only thing I don't like is when I put it in the dishwasher it gets water inside the pieces. I put a towel under the seat to absorb the leaking water. The seat stays together so well, I have a hard time taking it apart to put it in the dishwasher."
38101,1,"I LOVE this playpen. My son slept in the bassinet in the livingroom for WEEKS and it saved his father and I from running up and down stairs all night long. Especially handy since I had a c-section and simply couldn't do stairs. It's padded and lined and comfortable as can be for a little one. Since then, we've taken the bassinet attachment off and are using the playpen part every day. Small messes wipe clean with a wet towel - and big messes wash off with simply soap and water. My baby's learning to stand up in it and it keeps him from bumping and falling on hard surfaces. He's never once tipped this thing over - from the inside or outside. It's super simple to put together and even quicker to take down. Even my own mom with arthritis can do it with no trouble. It takes up less space than it looks, but offers plenty of room for a little one to play and sleep. And - when it's all taken down and folded up, it just slides right under the baby's crib until you need it again. We used to put baby changing stuff in the side compartment (which you can either use or just take off and store) but now we've got board books and pacifiers and baby's favorite bedtime friends in it! So handy to have these things right there at naptime! Thanks Graco!(I also bought the matching car seat and stroller and love THOSE as well!)"
88899,2,Do not buy diapers from Amazon. Your order will likely not ship unti lafter a couple of months or one fine day you will discover that your order has been cancelled because they ran out of stock. Not only that if your original order had multiple items on it and had qualified for free shipping they will charge you the shipping amount even though they are unable to fulfil this part of your order. I have voiced this concern strongly to CS and believe this is a false business practice they are following. If I were you I'd stay away from diaper shopping at Amazon.
86108,1,"We have a baby who's a very light sleeper and who also seems to make noises and whimper sometimes in the night. Even when she's sound asleep in the deep sleep part of her sleep cycle, just opening the door to her bedroom will frequently startle her awake. This monitor has been a lifesaver -- I can check everything (except whether she needs a diaper change!) by just peeking at the monitor. I can see if she's kicked off her blanket, making sleep noises or telling us she's really awake now, and lately, I can see if she's standing up in her crib. The camera portion is very easy to adjust to point to another area and I've also frequently used it to keep an eye on her while she's playing in a playyard or on the floor while I do a quick chore like washing the dishes or putting laundry in the washer. I really love being able to just peek at the monitor and see her sleeping, too -- it took a long time before we ever got to really watch her sleep peacefully!Pros:- obviously, a picture - worth a thousand audio-only monitors which we've also used- very clear picture and good range for picking up the signal - I can go to our neighbor's house and use it (she uses the same monitor, though, so we have to make sure we're on different channels - we had a really good laugh awhile back - they were having a cookout and I brought the baby home to put her to bed, then went back to the party, monitor in hand - I looked at the picture when I got there and it didn't show my baby's crib. Instead it showed another baby in a playyard. I realized it was her baby and so she switched the channel on hers and I was back to watching my own baby while enjoying the rest of the evening.Cons:- when the video part is on a lot, the battery does wear down rather quickly - or maybe I just keep looking at it too much!- it's a little big - doesn't fit easily in my jacket pocket if I'm outside, though it does clip to my jean's pocket/waistband decently if a little loosely- the lights indicating the noise level are really bright and also seem to be very sensitive so there's a lot of flickering and flashing - I hve to keep it upside down (lights down) on the nightstand during the nightOverall, the cons are really measly. It's a great way to keep an eye on the baby without worrying that I'll wake her up by checking on her. Haha, maybe I'll still be using it when she's 16."
75410,1,"I have a ""spirited"" two year old who played a Houdini on us while he was supposed to be in bed. After we found him I went right out to the store an purchased 3 of these for the doors around our hose. It does what it is supposed to do. I would tell anyone with children to install these thru - out their house."
184686,1,Just what we expected - sturdy - functional. Very pleased with the purchase. I needed to replace a very old gate.
131526,1,"Used this to take half potty-trained child across the country for a week. Child will not sit on standard potty seat because she's afraid to fall in the ""big hole"". This folding potty seat is great. I put this on dozens of toilets and it worked on all of them. Much more stable than others I've tried. Folds into quarters - still a little bulky but worth carrying if your alternative is wet pants. The little handles for the kid to hold onto while they're waiting to pee are very helpful."
87235,2,"At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week. It's not easy to squeeze the air out. Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up! Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out. I'm sorry I ever bought them."
169955,1,"So we ordered this bed because it was rated one of the best beds in 2012. Upon receiving the package, the box looked like it went through war, like it tried to defuse an IED, and failed. Most of the parts inside were in good condition, most. The metal spring frame for the mattress was bent out about an inch in the middle, as if someone had stepped on it multiple times, the rail that sits in the front and in the back tops, didn't match pertly on the sides, you could feel the bump because it was just a bit to high, but not to much of a bump, a 220 grit sand paper evens it so that the baby doesn't catch a splinter.Over all, this bed is a very good buy for the money. It is very sturdy, light, and simple to put together and it also comes w/ the conversion accessories for the toddler bed which is a plus and it looks very good. I would definitely recommend this to someone, just make sure you don't use UPS as a shipper, they are never on time, and they take your package to hell and back, literally."
102753,2,"I REGESTERED FOR THIS DAIPER PAIL. I LIKED IT AT FIRST THEN THE SPRINGS ON THE INSIDE BROKE SO WE FIXED THEM, EVERYTIME WE CHANGED THE BAG. THEN THE INSIDES FELL APART, SO WE FIXED THE INSIDE THE BEST WE COULD. THEN WE PUT STICK-UPS INSIDE TO HELP THE ODOR. FINALLY THE ODOR INSERT BROKE THE THE PAIL IS GONE. I AM ONLINE LOOKING AT NEW PAILS BEFORE I DRIVE TO THE STORE FOR OUR NEWEST BABY EXPENSE.... HOPEFULLY IT IS NOT A WATSE OF MONEY....."
169266,1,"I've never had a problem with Swaddlers. They were the first kind of diaper I used on my son and they got the job done. They are super soft and pretty absorbent, they also smell great (when unused of course!), They also fit my baby very well. The Huggies seem to run a little bit smaller. The only thing that I think would improve these diapers is if they made them ""baby shaped"" like the Huggies."
114820,1,"I am a big fan of booster seats that go on a regular chair, Vs those stand alone high chairs. At least for home use.This one is good enough quality of construction and a good enough design. I like it enough to give it 5 stars. It was cheapest for me to buy it on Amazon, with a reasonably trouble free shipping as well."
63159,1,"Assembly - This goes together fairly easily if you can follow instructions. I was able to do it myself, but another set of hands might have been useful when lining up some of the pieces. The hardest part is attaching the hindge to the top. It fits. Don't force anything. The number one rule is to make sure your screwdriver is the right size. If you feel yourself starting to strip the screw, stop and try again. DO NOT STRIP THOSE TWO SCREWS OR YOU WILL BE . . . well. . . screwed. Push hard as you turn and the two screws will go all the way in. Be patient. Soup to nuts, this took me about 20 minutes to assemble, and I am quite handy.Construction - Once assembled, this thing is rock solid. It weighs over 50 pounds of solid wood. The bottom and back are not solid wood, but that is unimportant. The top does not quite open 90 degrees, but the safety hindge leaves the top at any position.I have the natural finish and there was not a single imperfection in the wood.A+ - Highly recommend.FOLLOW-UP: The first one was a gift. I liked it so much, I bought another (in white) for us. The white one I bought was of equal high quality and went together very easily. I was impressed that the allen screws even had white painted matching heads. This is really terrific.If I had one very minor criticism, it would be that you must install the wheels and they do not lock. Thus, if you have this on a wood floor, it tends to roll around."
25584,1,"My best friend's daughter had just made the transition to sippy cup, and from a distance, I thought I should send something to commemorate. They adore this product, as does Julia. Beyond that, it arrived on time, and met all expectations. I'll do this for all of my other friends' and relatives' children."
8978,1,"I use these all the time and love them, The bright color's are eye appealing and my son like's them to, Waitress's alway's thank me for using them and ask where I got them. They peel off very easy to with no sticky residue."
140504,0,"I loved this swing when I got it... great seat adjustment options, great mobile, great music options, and I loved that it plugged into an electrical outlet (and was not battery-operated like my Fischer-Price Aquarium Swing). However, the music functionality broke within 2-3 weeks of getting it. I called Fischer-Price customer service, and they sent me a new motor unit, no questions asked. I got the new motor within 3-4 days. Great, right? NOOOOOOOOO!!! The music functionality in the second unit broke, too, this time after about 4-5 weeks. I didn't even bother calling Fischer-Price again, and now we just use the swing and mobile, without music."
105017,1,"I have a 1 year old and he pulls on it, climbs on it, plays with toys on it, and it is still solidly velcroed onto the bricks. I highly recommend it."
93670,2,"I couldnt get my son past trying to make the light go on and the music play, which is WAY too easy. There should be an on off switch, a bigger seat and a much less sensitive mechanism to trigger the music. It is also way too difficult to detach the seat from the legs in order to use the seat on an adult toilet bowl."
181456,1,"This seat is durable, well built and easy to install. After researching car seats for about a month, the Britax marathon was the one that impressed me the most. The LATCH system is amazing and I feel that my daughter is safe and secure. When installed correctly, the seat does not move! It really is worth every penny."
23654,0,"The picture on the box/website makes this portable chair look like it folds up like an umbrella. It does not. The underside braces fold sideways and inwards, so the chair is flat horizontally, however there is nothing keeping them folded. I keep this chair at our friends' house, so we don't have to port it, and it stores perfectly well. However, I would not recommend this chair to use in and out of a restaurant because it does not fold small nor stay folded. On the plus side, it is very strong. On our friend's stable table, the chair does not move, and I have every confidence of our toddler moving around in it."
8597,2,"I bought this thinking I would save a lot of room on my counter. Unfortunately, I use the wide Dr. Brown bottles and they don't fit at all! Even the normal width bottles can get stuck when you try to turn it. Also keep in mind if you use the curved bottles that this product won't hold those either. I returned this the next day, thank goodness! My best advice: get used to bottles on your counters! They're only little for so long!"
30233,0,A comprimise between a playpen and a crib. Not big enough or high enough to be a safe playpen and too low to be a good crib have to really bend down. But again it is a good choice for a youg baby probably for 6-9 mos.for travelling and grandparents.
173853,0,The lowest swing level is way too fast for a newborn. It feels almost like the baby will develop sea sickness from swinging on it.
44106,1,"Wonderful I have a 2 and a 3 yr old and bath time was difficult up until tonight. They let me rinse them in the ""waterfall"" so no fighting to rise their hair or body and they loved playing in it! Wonderful!!"
40820,2,Don't look at the old reviews of these diapers. Just look at the ones from the past few months and you'll see what the new trend is. I would ignore any 5 star reviews as they probably work for Pampers. There's not a conspiracy against Pampers...Pampers changed their diapers. They had great reviews until they changed them.
15264,1,"I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I received this from the shipper! Unfortunately, I did not love the pattern. There were a lot of white sections and it was really leafy. I was looking for something paisley with bright and pretty pinks and greens. The colors were pretty & I loved the stripes; you could match a lot with it. Those leafy sections just made it look cheap looking to me, especially the comforter. Although I am in the process of returning the entire set, I would order from this seller again. The seller made the returning part very easy and understood that I did not like the set once I saw it in person. I gave 4 stars because the seller was great but the item was not!"
77108,0,"I don't hate it but I don't love it.First con, Simply put I wish it had more incline/recline positions than just two, once baby's start wanting to try to sit up more (like my now 4mo old) they don't want to recline in a swing. This swing has no option to sit up straight..only recline and semi straight.Second con is it's huge. I even feel silly carrying this thing from one room to another.Third con is the stuffed animals hanging on top are angled outwards more for the look of the product, the baby can't see it very well.Fourth con is the head rest should be removable, it's not able to move up high enough so I had to cut it off.. and my son isn't even tall on the scales.Other than that the swing hasn't failed on me and the speed is fine. I wished it went slower when he was a newborn but now he's fine. Happy it has a power cord as well. I wished I would have went to the store to really look in person at these instead of going off reviews.. but it's making do."
108507,1,Nice fit and light weight. However the seat has a different design than shown. Ours has images of the Cars characters.
28581,2,"We bought this glider and ottoman for our baby's nursery, and I used it every day while nursing. The glider looks as pictured, and it is easy to assemble. The seat cushion is thin but comfortable enough. When we first bought it, the chair and ottoman both glided smoothly and quietly. After about 6 months the chair started squeaking loudly and the bolts started loosening and falling off. We used WD-40 on the chair and it didn't help. We had to stop using the chair because the squeaking kept the baby awake, instead of helping him fall asleep! We also tightened the bolts several times but they kept loosening and eventually bent, so we gave up."
69206,1,I am so happy that i finally found a larger size diaper. my child is only 2 and not ready to potty train and pull ups are so expensive. he is 45 lbs. but rather tall also and the size 6 are just 2 tight and starting to dig into his sides so this was great it gives him the extra room to wiggle around with the diaper hurting.
73672,1,"When you're going to become a first-time parent, you quickly learn that you need to buy lots of stuff. After our twins were born, we quickly began to learn that some of this stuff seemed like a great idea at the time we registered for or bought it, but has been used at most once - many items not at all.This item is different. You need it. Believe me!I found that this timer is the opposite of many items - as time passes, we find ourselves using it more and more often! Right after our twins were born, we wrote EVERYTHING down. For the first two weeks, all we needed was our detailed notebook and a wristwatch. We wrote down the time for everything - diapers, feedings, etc. Then when we went to the doctor for our two-week checkup, she said that everything was going great, and we didn't need to keep the notebook anymore! What we realized quickly is that we relied heavily on all of those notes to keep our lives (and the babies' lives) sane!When I added this item to our registry, my wife had criticized it. ""What do we need that for?"" she asked. My, what a big difference a little time makes! Without the notebook, out came the timer - and it goes everywhere with Mom. No more writing down times and calculating how long it's been since the last feeding started - even the most sleep-deprived among us can just glance at the easily-readable display (and use it's backlight in the dark) to see all of the key information. One useful feature for us is the side indicator. We use it to track which side the older (by 1 whole minute!) of our twins is supposed to nurse on - yet another item that we no longer need to remember or track on paper.The clip is also useful - easy to clip onto a nursing pillow, diaper bag, or virtually anywhere else.I definitely give this item 5 stars and recommend that everyone add it to their Amazon baby registry!I do have suggestions for improvements to the product as well. Version 2.0 might include some sort of simple alarm feature -- if you don't want baby to go longer than 3:15 between feedings, perhaps we could have an alarm that is programmed to automatically ring at 3:00 to give you a chance to wake yourself up enough to rouse baby, change the diaper as necessary, and get them settled in to yet another meal."
48977,1,"I ordered this to contain my wild 9 month old when I need to leave the room. He hates being in it unless my almost 3 year old daughter is in with him. I've put plenty of toys in the play yard and have attached toys to the sides as well.It was really easy to put together and they now include foam ""feet"" to prevent it from sliding on my hardwood floors. I haven't had an issue with either child being able to move it. Overall a good purchase!"
182504,1,"Our grand-daughter was born in October and lives 10 miles from us. With us helping out with babysitting three days a week we needed a base that was compatible with the one in our daughter's vehicle. This base is extremely easy to install and the seat just pops in. It's ideal for families with two cars, or grandparents that want to bring the grandchildren to their home for the day, or weekend, etc."
10334,1,My daughter really likes her pink potty seat. It is very comfortable for her as well as easy for her to put on the potty herself which is important to her.
104762,1,"fast delivery, actually faster than promisedhad item in stock even though most companies were out of iteasy to use"
181869,1,"The case is almost as good as the great baby care products inside. The CD is cute as well, but not what I expected. Would have been nicer had it been more a bath time fun CD i.e. splish splash, rubber ducky, etc.."
101389,1,"We have a 2-yr old and a 5-yr-old and we bought one of these for use in each of the kids' bedrooms to display their treasured stuffed animals. We've gotten compliments and inquiries (""where'd you get that?!"") many times and it is so much easier than the corner net style because the kids can access the animals they want without messing the other animals. Our two-yr-old loves that he can go clip and unclip his beloved friends on his own - be sure to put the most loved animals near the bottom!!! NOTE: This is made for small to medium sized stuffed animals - I would not recommend for larger or heavier items as the chain is plastic and may break with too much weight on it. My only complaint about the organizer is that some of the clips on ours broke easily. I had bought a set of 10 extra clips, so we'd have more than it came with but this was still disappointing in taking it out of the box. We do love the product, though."
40264,0,"This is a good size box for our usage. Living in the city we do not have much storage space, so these keep me from running out of diapers every week, but at the same time don't take up too much space. The diapers in the last couple of orders have been leaving lint on my baby, but this set seems better."
28418,1,"I like this glider and ottoman, it was easy for my hubby to put together and came when it was supposed to. I think baby and I will enjoy it."
9142,2,"I saw all the bad reviews, but since there were also some good ones, I registered for this anyway. I should have trusted my previous experience that the customer ratings on amazon are accurate when there are over 50 responses. First, if you have anything other than a plain crib, this won't fit on the side rail. Not a big deal, I have a newborn so she's in a bassinet right now anyway. I didn't have any problem with the sound level as others have written, but I had many problems with the unit itself. It is very difficult to open, you need two hands, and it makes a very loud noise when it opens and closes (not good for a sleeping baby). The batteries are not easy to change. The biggest problem I found was that the unit would often give me an error message when I pressed play. This happened about half the time for no apparent reason and no matter which CD I had in it. For $49.99, I expect a much better quality product and could easily get regular CD player that can be plugged in or use batteries, so I'm taking this back to the store. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
61139,2,"The diaper gene was great for like the first 2-3 months when you are changing your diaper almost every hour and the trash can is to far away for you to lift your weary body and walk that direction...... but after it is really unessacary. It isnt so great that you JUST HAVE TO HAVE IT yeah it muffles the smell a little bit but so does air freshner, and to be honest my diaper gene has been sitting in my daughters room catching dust for the last 8 months because I dont want to change the liner because it is such a pain!!!! I mean cmon! Does this whole diaper disposal have to be rocket science for us tiered moms????JUST TRUST ME, YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT, spend the [money] on something else you could really use like a mancure or a new pair of shoes.... you wont be sorry."
57199,0,"If you buy this for a gift, be considerate and either by two or be prepared to curse the recipient into buying an $80 replacement after their child becomes attached.I received this as a baby gift for my son who is now 9 months old. When I first received it, this blanket was INCREDIBLY soft and luxurious. My son and I feel for it immediately. Even at a few weeks old, he cuddle and bury his face in it. Now, he can't sleep without it. When I first got it, I'd give it a five stars, but it's lost it's softness already so I've reduced the rating to three stars. Given it's expensive price, I would hope the softness would last at least a year. I was first suspicious it would lose it's softness and get matted when I noticed that my niece's, who had the same blanket for a 1 1/2 years, no longer had it's supple texture. In a matter of months (despite washing it in the gentle cycle with Woolite), my son's blanket was matted too and has lost it's chenille softness on one side. It's not rough per say, but it's about the texture of a well-loved older teddy bear. Now, my son is incredibly attached and I'm afraid that I'm going to have to buy an identical blanket as a safety and at $80 or so for a child's blanket I'm a little flabbergasted. (It's only recently bought a king size duvet for our adult bed for twenty bucks more!) Overall, the seams are holding together nicely and the back side is nice and silky although I can see an ever-so-subtle hint of snags in places. I just wish my son had grown attached to a cheaper blanket. I fear the day, it gets accidentally dropped/left somewhere."
76251,1,"My title says it all: BPA-free, Durable, Good Value. I use the trays to get perfect 0.5 oz. servings of home-cooked grains and vegetables. This is a fantastic alternative to either cooking small quantities fresh daily (who has time for that with a baby) or constantly feeding liquified sludge from a jar (ew). Don't get me wrong, Earth's best is awesome -- as like a topping to whole grain pasta -- but babies are people, too, and amazingly, they like FOOD! These are great trays. When the food is frozen, you can pop out the cubes and put them in a baggie. The cubes (in a baggie) won't freeze together after being frozen in the trays, and then you can use the trays for more stuff. If you're serious about cooking real food for your baby/toddler, I recommend getting at least 6. I have only enough room for 6 (and that was all I was willing to shell out for food trays), and although I have to put stuff in baggies quite a bit, 6 has been an okay quantity for me. If I had a bigger freezer, I would definitely go for more trays! P.S. I handwash mine. I'm not sure you can put them in dishwasher, but I think the handwashing helps them last!"
30257,0,"Cute item, little interest in the monkey, not the potty. He likes to hear the monkey speak. No intrest in the book. Okay product.I would not buy again."
42088,2,I would never recommend this to any child and most children starting on a sippy is teething which makes it even more unsafe. I bought 2 of these for my son to start on. I started him using it at 7 months and felt it was the best to use due to the soft mouth part like a silicon nipple. Well he would occasionally bite down like on a nipple and only had it 2 weeks when I noticed the build in valve was broke and hanging there. I read the cleaning instructions and followed them even the part not letting my son chew on it. I took it when he bit on it and made sure when cleaning it nothing poked the valve. I mainly used dishwasher but time to time would push some soapy water through. To my eyes the other one had the same problem. So I got 2 more and called the company about it worried another child might choke and to see if there was some defect. She told me that they should last a couple months not 2 weeks. She said that poking something through while cleaning or even my son biting on it could break it and if I noticed this it was time to throw it out and get a new one. She did say I could send them back and they would be checked but it was probably wear and tear. I went out and purchased the playtex sippy starters and he took to those. No more built in valves. Use caution if you do purchase but I would not buy any more because better safe then sorry.
159521,1,"My baby has loved this bouncer from day one! We put him in it for the first time when he was two weeks old. He could have stared at the aquarium toy bar for hours, if we let him. The seat, with vibrator, was also a great way to soothe him and put him to sleep on those evenings when he didn't want to go to bed. He is now 12 weeks old and laughs and giggles every time we put him in the bouncer. We even purchased the crib aquarium toy so that we could put him down to sleep in his crib without screams and cries. The best toy we've received/purchased to date."
68464,2,"After a year of hauling my huge tandem stroller in and out of the trunk of my baby SUV, I finally decided to spend the big bucks and purchase this stroller for my toddler twin boys. We were getting ready to go on two back-to-back long-distance trips and I wanted a stroller that would fit in the car and still leave room for our luggage. The Aria Twin fit the bill, but we ran into many other problems along the way.1 - The first issue we had was that it was harder to steer than it had seemed in the store. I had tried it out with the boys in it and had thought it was fine, but after using it just a little bit more, I realized that the front wheels do not swivel very well at all. This was an annoyance the whole trip but became a near-crisis when we were out one day and the rubber tire came off one of the wheels while I tried to turn it (and I was on a smooth surface, at the mall, not on rough terrain). If I had not had someone else with me, there would've been no way I could've gotten the tire back on by myself. Even with help, it was a big struggle. If we had not finally gotten it back on, I don't know how I would've gotten out of the mall (neither of the boys were walking yet and there's no way I could've carried both of them, nevermind the stroller too!).2 - The second problem we encountered became a huge aggravation. Something was wrong with the latching mechanism that was supposed to hold the snack trays in place. It would not lock the way it was supposed to, so the boys were able to repeatedly open and shut the trays, sometimes on each other's fingers. A few times I was able to force the thing to lock, only to discover that I couldn't get it back open without major difficulty. I could've taken the trays off, but one of the reasons I wanted this stroller was b/c of the snack trays. It's important to me to be able to give the boys snacks that they don't have to hold onto.3 - The basket underneath dragged. Originally, I didn't think this was a big deal. Then, after a day at the zoo, the dragging on pavement started wearing a hole in the fabric. This was a problem partly b/c I didn't want a hole in a brand-new stroller, and partly b/c I didn't want anything to happen that would compromise the resale value. I did not put anything bulky or heavy in the basket that caused this to happen. There were two toddler baseball caps, two very lightweight toys, and a small board book in the basket. And still the thing dragged.4 - The plastic labels on the sides and front of the stroller began coming off. In addition to another compromise in resale value, this became a safety issue of small parts coming off the stroller. I had noticed that the word ""Aria"" had begun peeling off one of the sides; the next thing I knew, one of my sons had it in his mouth.5 - The sunshades began to warp slightly.I just returned this stroller today, and I am very sad that it did not work out. I loved how it looked, how it folded up, how light it was. It was such a nice change from my tandem, and I really wanted it to be worth the money. I was very disappointed that something that cost so much seemed to be cheaply made in some crucial ways.I am now trying to decide between the Combi Twin Savvy and the Jeep side-by-side. I know there is no perfect double stroller, but there has got to be something better than this."
147577,1,"This hat is very cute and would be warm. However, it is not big enough for a large baby or a baby older than a few weeks. My son weighed 9lbs 9oz and this hat did not fit."
89545,2,"I bought these when they were a killer deal. I have a 4 month old and I have never used this brand before. BAD MISTAKE! They ended up giving my little girl a burn-like rash on her bottom and I only used 2 of them. It took almost a week for it to go away after I switched back to huggies. It was NOT a diaper rash, it was way worse, it happened almost instantly after I started use. I would not recommend to anyone. After I returned these (can I just say Amazon has the best customer service EVER!!!) I read reviews of other moms on different websites and it seems like I am not the only one this has happened too."
86034,2,"Battery was out of juice after just a year of use. Screen went out after 2 years. This won't last through one kid, let alone multiple kids."
57213,0,"Like the stroller in use, but it is very big and heavy. The recline is a little difficult as you have to use both hands to lower seat back if child is in the stroller. Also I can not find a sturdy snack tray for this stroller. It also does not have a locking mechan. for it when it is folded. I liked my trimode twin better, but that too was heavy. I am in search of another stroller now."
93644,0,My parents bought this seat for my two year old. He wouldn't sit on the thing while the legs were on but loves it on the toilet. He always removes the cup in the front and to see how tight it fits when he is seated I can't blame him. It was worth the money just for the toilet seat and book but be warned. Once your child discovers how to trigger the music you will fight to keep their hands out of the toilet. If you ask me I could have bought a nice toilet seat without the extras for a bit less. But then again they sure love that music.
15464,2,"We purchased this set twice for our 2 year old son. The framework is metal, but the hinges are plastic. (whose bright idea was that?) Our son managed to break them just by leaning on them and he isn't a big kid. Since the hinge is plastic, the hinge just snapped in two. We've since bought another brand (One Step Ahead) and that one broke (in the same way) within a week of delivery. We are still looking for the best rail, short of my husband building a wooden ""cage"" to go around the bed. I don't recommend purchasing this product unless you like to make frequent trips to BRU to return the rails and having to take apart the bed every time they break"
52005,1,"The baby carrier is not very heavy and does its job. The back support is well designed as well, you can trust this carrier."
138229,1,My daughter just loves this! She isnt so crazy about her room and this helped a lot. The little stars and moons that shine on the walls and ceiling are just great-it acts now as her night light too. Great addition to your childs room.
118996,0,The Aura select is easy to assemble and was ready to go in twenty minutes after opening the box. the big disappointment though was the fabric (it was coarse/non-soft). One would have thought all the different colors in the aura select range would be made of the same type of fabric.. however it turns out the black is the only color with the softer fabric.. we were deceived into thinking that the lower price on the pink was only a factor of the color and not the fabric... a difference of [...] bucks.. in hind sight .. maybe I shud have gone for the black.. may be the manufacturers can clarify this when they post product info..hence the three stars.. so far the travel system has performed within normal parameters
89030,1,"My daughter doesn't complain, so they must be fine. Also, she prefers her diapers rather than wearing panties, so they must be good. Conversation: Would you like to wear panties? &#34;Yes&#34;, Would you like to potty in the toilet? &#34;No&#34;, Do you like your diapers? &#34;yes...baby&#34;. She's two and refuses to potty train."
34270,1,This is a great sturdy bag for traveling. My daughter's Chicco car seat fit perfectly and the bag was even strong enough to handle the baggage claims at the airport. The padding keep my daughter's car seat secure and clean. As for shipping I received the product in no time. I would recommend this bag to any mommy that have to carry their own child car seat when traveling.
125437,1,"My 5 month old loves this teether. Not sure if she actually has teeth coming in, but when given the choice of different toys, she always picks this one. When she is fussy, this calms her better than a pacifier and since she doesn't suck on it, I don't have to worry about nipple confusion or that it will be habit-forming. I can see why it gets so many great reviews."
161495,1,"I started using this tub when my baby girl was a few weeks old. At first it leaked a WHOLE lot but that was because I did not get the snaps right in place. Once it was in, it was wonderful. It had the sling for when she was an infant. When she grew older, she used the bath ring. Now, she's old enough (16 months) that she doesn't need the ring anymore. She loves splashing around in this tub. It's deep enough that she can do it."
86950,1,"I will never, ever go back to regular baby bottles. And if you try these, I'd bet dollars to donuts that you won't either. Yes, there will be less gas and fewer spitups, but that's not the biggest advantage in my opinion.Get the Playtex dropins and you'll be off getting manicures and reading your favorite gossip magazine. Ok, maybe not, but you will be amazed at how much time you recapture when you don't have to wash bottles. The only thing you need to wash is the nipples, and those really don't take nearly the same effort as bottles, and they don't sit with spoiling milk in them either, as bottles do if you don't wash them right away. I've got a few more than a day's worth of bottles, and a quick sterilization every evening gets all the nipples clean and ready for the next day. No bottles piling up in the sink. Thanks for my life back and for the extra time I have with my daughter."
148988,1,"I'm pregnant with twins, and have a lot of back pain. This does help to get me realigned at night, and keep me in place -- until I have to get up for the bathroom. It is hard to turn over when you are snuggled into it (but I don't know if that is b/c I'm so big already). Also you have to reposition it around you when you turn over, but I expected that b/c you have to do that anyway when using multiple pillows -- luckily this is just one pillow so it takes about 3 seconds to do that. This is a HUGE pillow and takes up a ton of space, so be prepared for that. Yes, you will be a little warmer with all that around you, it's a giant cotton pillow for goodness sake. I find it soft and worth the extra space it needs...Overall, I'm very satisfied b/c of the help it is giving to get me more comfortable at night (and it's helpful when folded in half to prop up and watch tv)! I'm so thankful I purchased this. Definitely worth it."
152573,1,"I love this product. I bought it for my 8 month old grandson it is so cuddlely and warm. My daughter had been taking him out in a winter jacket and then having to take it off in the car because he was too uncomfortable with the jacket and seat belt. She would then have to blast the heater to keep him warm. Now she puts a hoodie on him, wraps him in a blaket to get out to the car and slips him in his bundle me. It can easliy be transfered into his stooler if going to the mall or any other place you have to stroll the baby."
27108,1,"I haven't used this sling product for very long, but so far it's helped with some of aches and pains of 3rd trimester.One note on the sizing: some have said that they needed a size larger than what the package would indicate. I did NOT find this to be true. I'm 5'4&#34; and about 145 lbs (29 weeks pregnant) and I feel most supported with the small size set at it's smallest. I tried the medium cradle first because of the reviews, and it did not provide enough support. I am in good shape and do a lot of walking and jogging, so that could have something to do with sizing."
47054,1,We're really happy with this stroller. It navigates well on urban streets and folds incredibly easily. No stroller seems to be made for children on the taller side but this one does the job pretty well. I have an almost 4.5 yr old and a 2.5 yr old and the P&T Vibe that we have just doesn't cut it with their tall heights. This stroller allows my older one to walk most of the time but have somewhere to sit when he gets tired.
130220,1,"I love this swing. my child cryed all the time but in this swing oh does it make so much of a differce. She does not cry b/c i have another swing and she would just cry in it but she loves that this one is i guess like soothing, she looks at the lights and fishys and goes to sleep, helps out when you are at your ends when you need a free minute to do something instead of holding them all the time b/c of the crying. but pay the cost and get what you really need."
129895,1,works great! Having a second base makes it super convenient to change back and forth between vehicles.
107379,2,"We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter. Well, it is ALOT quieter than our monitor, but like others said, it makes this awful beeping noise! It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before! We also have another digital phone, so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel. I would look elsewhere for another monitor.. The beeping is what gets to me - I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night!Edit: Since we moved 8 months ago.. we continue to use this monitor. We no longer have a digital phone in the house.. and the beeping has stopped. It is quiet, you do not have to worry about batteries, it is rechargeable, very portable, and is just so quiet now..! If you have another digital device in your home.. do NOT get this monitor.. if you dont have digital devices.. then this is the monitor to get!"
8016,0,"Beautiful, fade-resistant colors ...I bought two of these - one in Navy and one in Red. They are very soft to the touch (and stayed that way even after a few washes), but they are SO thin. I was really shocked.I actually had a well-worn Simmons changing pad cover that was very plush (I was buying these to replace it), and I ended up keeping it to use UNDER these. I have a hard time complaining about such a low price, but a person should really know what they are getting.So, if you buy one and don't want to be stunned by what comes out of the package - keep these things in mind:1. They are THIN ...2. Very stretchy/gauzy3. Stitching isn't anything amazing4. They do wash nicely5. Liquids pool on the top (if you have a toileting accident, it buys you time before it soaks through)6. Each one has crescent moon-shaped slots for the changing table pad's safety straps"
127306,1,"Looks great, easy to put together. Very sturdy, and adjustable. I like its build, my wife likes its look. Consumer Reports highly recommends this product, and I now can too."
178995,0,"i am a fist time mother and had gotten these bottles for my baby shower from several people. and i also received the breast pump that matches. while i love the shape of the nipple and how its very natural, i do have a problem with leaking.after using them for about the 5th or 6th month the silicone seal lets milk leak through. i've repeatedly soaked myself while pumping and have just ended up throwing half of them away. i have no idea how this problem has occured since i wash them all by hand and only boiled the for sterilization.i agree that they work well for the price and would rather suggest just buy new all new ones after a few months. i've also since began to use the first years Soothie bottles and have been much more pleased with them. its just an added nuisance to pump into playtex bottle then pour into soothie bottle"
143720,1,"This cover worked wonderfully for us until our daughter's legs could no longer be contained with it on the car seat. So the taller your baby, the less time you'll be able to use it. It blocked out wind and rain well, but without a cover over her face, we had to arrange the flaps just right to protect her in severe weather. Might recommend one that has a face flap instead. However, I gave it 4 stars because it also worked really well as a cover over the bjorn (front carrier). We put her head through the opening, then pulled the rest down around her hanging legs. It kept her warm and dry as we walked, and we were able to get a lot of use out of it like this."
184523,1,"I purchased this item after my 4.5 month old son would not stop eating the bar on the shopping cart. I use it in high chairs at restaurants, adult chairs at home, and in his wagon. The travel seat is most helpful in the shoping cart. This is now the product I purchase for new moms. A great investment (...)."
129631,1,"My 3-month old daughter received this toy as a hand-me-down gift and just LOVES it!!! I recently brought it to a play date and my friends 5-month old loved this toy so much, she went and bought it also! There are no loud noises (which is great for us parents!) and it is very easy for babies to grab onto. My daughter constantly has it in her mouth and loves to ""talk"" to it...we call it her ""talking toy"". I am buying a back up just in case something happens to the one I have now. Definitely get this toy!"
10199,1,"I have a long toilet top at home and it fits perfect. I even Bring it with me to stores and it fits on those toilets to. I taught my son to push/move his privates downward so urine goes into the toilet, so there is no mess while sitting. Just FYI from another review. This item is sturdy, easy to clean and great to take with you when you are not at home."
168508,1,"These diapers are my favorite. They are soft, fit well and are a great value when you sign up for Subscribe and Save.I have only had a few blow-outs and more often than not they have been user error. You do have to make sure that you pull the edges out around the bottom and legs to make sure they are properly covered. I have had almost no leaks not that my baby is eating solid foods and he isn't exclusively breastfed (meaning his poo isn't so runny)."
29860,0,"Cute little set that I purchased for my son, he ended up playing with it though instead of using it as intended so I had to buy another one."
174925,1,"My baby is 6 months old now and he outgrew his newborn tub. He was tired and cranky on it, now he's happy with this munchkin tub. He plays on it for almost 30 mins every night while I bathe him, it's like a spa for him. The only issue I find is he needs a lot of supervision, he moves a lot and he went underwater once by mistake, so I have to be super careful, but when don't you have to be super careful with a 6 month old! :)"
12209,1,"all the kidco gates and accessories are VERY high priced, but I could not find anything else out there that was ascetically pleasing and got the job done effectively."
158734,1,"These are nice because they help keep our squirmy 18 month old covered up at night. As well with her feet tied up a little, it makes it more difficult to climb out of the crib. Bonus!!!The only reason we ordered new ones is because the ""hand-me-downs"" from her big sister finally wore out. Her older sister is three. Great Value!!!"
52825,1,"My daughter is 2 weeks old and since she weighed only 4lbs 12 oz. she is constantly being held by everyone. We could not get any sleep since when we put her down at night, she would always wake up. Two nights ago, we broght this product upstairs with us and it is a miracle. She sleeps in it with the music and vibrations on. It is the only thing that worked. We love it. I wished it would have the option to run longer, but she is certainly content, we just reach over and hit the swith when she gets fussy. I would also love it if there was a remote control options that would let us just hit the button to reset the music/vibrations. It is definatly an awesome product for the money"
82138,1,The product washes very well but should have been made of a softer fabric for children.
14642,1,"Many people complain about leaking and I must admit that it happened to me a few times too. So to prevent it from leaking I would screw on the top as tight as I could, and it would still leak. So that's when I figure it out.If you screw on the top too tight it will leak.Im telling you that this is true. My bottles have not leaked once since I figured this out. Just tighten it until it just first feels tight, and it will not leak.Saying that, I absolutly LOVE these bottles. The wide mounth is easy to clean. It's easy to figure out which size nipples to use as the baby outgrows them. And if your breast feeding, they have everything you need and it all works right with the bottles. No extra work! I highly recomend these."
49568,0,"some bent out of shape.dont make a big area with these.. but for 4-5 pieces they are useful.not super easy to put on and take off but not too bad either.i used it for my baby for a long time. be gentle and dont force trying to set it up, or you will break them."
156812,2,"In general, I think the excersaucer is a great idea, however I am returning this model for a different one. Baby's hand can get stuck under the ball (w/little plastic balls for noise inside). Not to mention that the castle (with the rolling wheel) pops off and hits him in the face. He would be playing just fine, and all of the sudden he would start crying like he was hurt. This always happend when the castle came off of the saucer but I never saw what exactly made him cry. I wondered if he was just upset that it came off. I watched him very closely and then I saw it happen. It was horrible. He tried to pull the castle close to put it in his mouth, however it is not a bending piece, so it popped out of its mount and hit him EXTREMELY hard in the mouth. I would not recommend this toy to anyone, unless these two pieces were removed, so you may as well buy a different one!"
173849,2,"We purchased this swing for our premature daughter when she weighed only 4lbs and the motor burnt out on it within 6 weeks. We were not able to return the swing to the store because we threw out the box and the store would not take it back w/out it. Only Babiesrus sells it so we were pretty much stuck! I called Fisher Price and the part was back ordered 3 weeks is what they told me, it however took 6 weeks to recieve it. I called several times to no satisfaction after multlple calls I did recieve a $25.00 gift certificate towards the purchase of another F/P product. I was told that it was on back order due to several similar problems.Also when we recieved the part it appeared to be refurbished due to a scratch on the mirror which had a protective cover on it. It appeared somewhat overly handled. Well now my daughter who is 11lbs has been using the swing for about 4 weeks and this swing makes so many creeking and popping noises due to the fact that there is very little support for the legs (torsion support) the swing wants to twist due to the motion and weight. This has been the worst baby product ever designed. I absolutely hate it and I can't believe I spent over $130.00 after tax on such a worthless piece of baby equipment whatever happened to products that were made to last at least till the child grows out of it!!!!!"
141574,1,Birthday gift for twin grands for first birthday. Really has helped in getting them to get around. Lots of things to keep them busy and interested too. They love it!
128390,1,"I took off a star because I find the scent of the 'bags' annoying, but it is a very useful product."
2511,1,"The Pampers baby dry diapers are a great value. They are a good quality diaper, but don't have the cost of the high end diapers. They work great for my baby!"
89456,2,"I have a two year old. We have been ordering this diaper for over a year now from Amazon. This last shipment has been very poor in that the sides rip everytime I try to ""fasten"" them across her legs/hips. I am very disappointed in the pampers product at this point. Over half of the current package opened has ended in this fashion. I am having second thoughts about my next shipment hoping it is not just the diapers Amazon ships for Pampers."
18518,1,"My daughter is 6 months old. We are still nursing, but due to problems establishing nursing, bottles were an early necessity and continued to be when I had to return to work after only a few months. From the beginning my daughter was very accepting of the nipples and has gone back and forth from breast to bottle with ease.Air has never been a problem. Even when she was small, spitting up was rare and is pretty much unheard of at this point. Early on it was generally only necessary to burp her once during each feeding and now, we rarely even need to bother.My only minor issue was the leaking, and after reading some of the reviews I now have the answer for dealing with that! Thanks!"
93778,2,"The picture on the box is deceiving. It makes it look like this thing is a breeze to install and operate. When you get it home and open the box, there are 4 large cheap plastic panels that look ugly. The when you try to open the gate, you best have both hands free or you wont get through. Try to open the gate with one hand, while your other hand is full, no way.To mount it to the wall, you have to drill pilot holes for the screws, 14 of them and thats alot to patch when you take it down to return it. The screws arent long enough to hold it under any type of force applied to the gate. The locking mechanism is horrible, you have to use both hands to lock and unlock it, its basically like putting two pieces of plastic puzzle together and if you dont get it just right, it wont lock. If you have molding on the bottom of your walls, you will have to mount it above the molding. I wouldnt recommend this gate to anyone. There are other gates that are alot easier to install and open and close."
42495,2,"I'm an attachment parent so baby wearing is a daily thing for my family. I've tried every kind of wrap, sling or carrier, and the Moby wrap made me so uncomfortable I almost had to ask my husband to cut me out of it. First off, I'm tall and slender, and when I would wear my daughter in it, I looked pregnant again. It's so unflattering. Too bulky. Also, even in the dead of winter, it made me so hot I couldn't wear it. I'm sure I was having hot flashes because of breast feeding hormones, but isn't it inferred/implied that the woman wearing the Moby wrap might be breast feeding?! If you're looking for an easy way to wear your baby, IMO go for a ring sling. On a daily basis I use the Sakura Bloom linen slings. It takes a little practice, just like any baby carrier does, but once you get it you just slip your baby in and go. And you don't have to take it completely apart to take it off. And it won't make you look like you're twice your size."
122379,1,"I love the quality of this cup, as well as the pictures on it. There are less pieces than some sippy cups, which makes it easier to clean. This has become my daughter's favourite cup."
92579,1,"I thought my mother-in-law was nuts (and a little old-school) when she gave me this food grinder, but I have used it with three sons, a nephew, and two nieces. The beauty of this grinder is that you can put aside some of dinner, grind it up, add a little liquid when necessary, and feed the baby ""right from the dinner table."" Meat with veggies is a fan favorite. Some things are dry in nature, and thus grind up a little more difficultly, but a little added milk or cereal always works. The grinder always cleans up easily and travels well. I love this product and highly recommend it."
139311,1,Purchased this for my great niece & nephew (9 month old twins.) It fascinated them with all the stars and moons on the ceiling and walls. Fascinated all the adults too. Only thing I would change is the red did not show up nearly as well as the other colors.
41529,1,"I love this toy, I bought it for my 5 year old and he is suddenly ""getting"" how money adds up. Great for learning number values and great for getting kids excited about earning COINS for odd jobs around the house!"
92845,1,"My 11 week old daughter could not handle tummy time. She would lay on her tummy for 5 mins TOPS and then WAIL! Now when she is on the ladybug she moves herself around and has tripled her tummy time! She did not like it much as first but we worked up to it. She seems to do a little better JUST on the ground, too. Her favorite part is the mirror and will spin herself around everytime to find it! She also likes the bright yellow face of butterfly! :)"
170341,1,"I would highly recommend this seat for newborns/infants and toddlers who are slimmer/lankier than most other kids.My first child had the Eddie Bauer seats, and I was always bothered that when he slept, after facing the seat forward, his head would always droop forward. So, with my second I was determined to get this nicer seat. I was so glad I did up until now (28 months). My daughter starts screaming and struggling to get out after about 10 minutes. She's a normal sized baby - not overweight or underweight - but now that she's getting bigger, the straps seem to bother her to no end. They seem to be too tight at her neck. Also, the seat doesn't sit fully upright. It has 2 settings and neither one sits her in a normal upright position, which I think also bothers her. Perhaps if she was a skinnier kid like her older brother.I LOVED the seat for her as an infant - it was super easy to install and didn't budge - even with the bulkiness of it. But, now, unfortunately, I'm going to have to sell it and put her her older brother's Cosco/Eddie Bauer seats!Also, the seat cover and straps have been washed numerous times and still look brand new. But, it is quite tricky to clean the ""undercarriage"" nooks and crannies.~M. Tilse"
15689,1,"I love this bunting. I have a chicco keyfit, and it fits beautifully in the carseat. It doesn't fit like in the picture, but it works. It keeps my baby very warm, which is great in our cold Minnesota winters. I highly recommend it!"
49090,1,This heavy-duty pen is working out great for our new puppy when we take her out of her crate. The sections are moveable and we created a rectangular shape that is working perfect in our kitchen. The no-slide pads keep her from moving the pen.
130364,1,"This was by far one of the best items we purchased. I would strongly recommend one of the cradle swings from Fisher Price. You can use this swing right after birth because the recline position. I can't stress how important this feature is to me. My girlfriends had the other type of swing and they couldn't use it right away. When they did use it and their babies would fall asleep, the babies head would be hunched over =( The only bad thing about this swing is that the elaborate mobile does go through batteries quickly. I just started turning the mobile off as soon as my little one was asleep, to get a little more juice out of the batteries. This swing is truly a blessing!!!"
17818,1,"Our son loved this mobile.It wasn't perfect...the motor was a little loud, the remote could turn our TV on and the mobile was hard to fit to our crib.We are going to buy another for our second child since it was a huge hit with the first."
80360,1,"There's not much out there for mini cribs, and this mattress was perfect for the long visit at gma and gpa's. My baby would be sleeping for over a week in the mini crib so I wanted to make sure both of us would be getting sleep. It's firm, comfortable, and baby had no problems sleeping! Don't count on the thin foam mattress that comes with the crib to serve any purpose other than for taking short naps in, or at most, an overnight visit."
124124,1,"We bought my daughter the Dora version of this bed a couple of months ago. My husband put it together without a problem. It's durable, yet lightweight and easy to move around if you need to. Our daughter went crazy over it and is so proud to sleep in it. Anyone with bedtime challenges may want to try it out, or something similar. No more lying in bed with her to get her to fall asleep, as she thinks I'm too big to lie in it. Defintely got my money's worth."
67001,1,"I love this set for running around with baby! I received the pink set as a gift for baby #4, and I wish I had it earlier. The cups and lids are great for stowing snacks in a diaper bag, the little bowls for cut up pieces of whatever baby will have for lunch. I never used these for eating at home, only for running around and basically storage. They are very cute and I love them! I haven't had any problem in the top rack of my dishwasher. The sippy cup lids, however, are not very useful, as they would leak, everything else I love. I use these in conjunction with the name labels by Inchbug which were just the right size to wrap around the cups!"
439,2,"I purchased this kind of diapers from Amazon hoping this is the lowest price I can get. Obviously, it is cheaper with 30% off but it is very bad quality. My wife has to change the diapers 2-3 hours because of the draining. I used to get the same one from Target and I was happy with it but for this one? No. I wouldn't recommend any mom to purchase this item from Amazon."
76060,1,These trays are so convenient for freezing homemade baby foods. They make my life much easier. Fore sure I recommend them to anybody who makes baby foods.
160891,1,Bought it for myself.. it was the only bag I found that would fit my personality. Now my husband wants one. I love it! Only negative is that the cell phone holder is completely useless if you own anything other than a flip phone.
139810,1,"We bought this walker when my daughter was 4.5 months old. We held off putting her in it until she was 5 months. She's on the short side, but was able to reach the floor. Immediately she started scooting backwards. She just loves being closer to the floor and our Shih Tzu, Chloe! There's just the right amount of toys and the mirror is nice too (she can't see in it yet). The handle on the back will help her walk when she's older and it doesn't go too fast so I am not afraid of it slipping away too fast. I'd really recommend this product."
177402,2,"I had been using this pump for a couple months. It worked pretty well - I have a fast let-down so I could get a few ounces in only a few minutes. However, it was very squeaky and would keep my husband up at night while I was pumping. Also it was not very ergonomical and pretty messy. (The way it's put together, milk collects under the rubber shield and drips out the bottom.) We also had problems with the bottles leaking. There are a lot of parts to clean too.The last straw was when I was cleaning it, and putting it back together, one of the rubber seals wouldn't fit back on correctly. It didn't come with ANY directions for cleaning, assembly, or disassembly so I couldn't tell what I'd done wrong. And apparently, you can't get any spare parts for it. So I decided to try a different pump.Thank goodness I did!! I bought the Medela Harmony manual pump and it is 1000% times better! It's quieter, came with very clear and thorough directions, is more comfortable, works just as well, and has far fewer parts! Definitely go with the Medela if you're looking for a hand pump!"
133271,0,"Overall, I've been happy with this rocker, but for the price, I expected more.Pros:- Good looking chair- You can use it from day one (the chair fully reclines)- Once the baby is big enough he/she can rock themselves with their weight- Folds nicely and compactly (it would be easy to travel with)Cons:- The harness straps are cheap and extremely difficult to take on and off- The cover is attached to the toy bar, and you cannot push it back making it impossible keep the toys hanging without full cover- It's impossible to take the baby in or out of the bouncer with the cover on.- You can barely feel the vibrator. It's almost pointless to have it as a feature."
39858,1,"I originally had the 'Mommy Bear' also from Dex products & my son loved the heartbeat sound. Problem with that was it would shut off after 40 mins & he would wake up. When I saw this was made from the same company, I knew it would be the same sound, so I bought this right away from Babies R Us. The AWESOME thing about this is that you can PLUG it into the wall & you can choose to set it to 15 mins or permanently on. My son is now 13 months old & still sleeps with the heartbeat/womb sound on all night. I love this!"
184736,2,"For this swing being expensive, and Graco I thought it would be great, but boy was I wrong!! The bouncr is nice and the vibrating part works, but the swing does not. You press the setting and give it a push to start and the motor sounds like it is working, but the swing is not moving. I put it on a hard surface like it suggests and it still wont work. The nature sounds are also creepy. It sounds like airplanes over head or Godzilla pounding down the street. I am very disapoiinted! Do not buy this swing!"
70162,2,"This product is absolutely useless. Save your money. The first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it. In addition, there's no way to attach it to the carrier, stroller, or whatever. So when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it, all it does is slide around. So it's more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout."
78167,1,"My 1 year old, 26 lbs son loves this highchair and so do we. It adjusts in so many ways your child is guaranteed to be comfortable. Goes well with my decor also."
34173,1,"I love this carseat bag! This is actually the second bag we have purchased (now we have one for each child). We have used our first one on multiple trips all across the country (we travel a lot). The backpack style is perfect for someone who is pushing a stroller with one hand and pulling a suitcase with another. It is a bit bulky and cumbersome, but that is too be expected considering the size of the carseats. We use it for our Britax Marathon and Britax Frontier- it works perfectly. You can also throw a couple blankets and/or jackets in the bag with the carseat if you are running low on space. Airlines currently don't charge for carseats so it travels for free! Again, best travel purchase I have made!"
133244,0,Its okay for wiping a baby's bottom. Don't use on the face because it caused my daughter to break out.
110032,1,I was pleased with this mattress. It is reasonably priced and my baby seems to be comfortable sleeping on it. I wish it was a tad bit thinner but I am sure it differs from crib to crib. All together a good mattress.
15902,1,"Attached very well and easy on my baby's stroller and he is very confortable and warm. When he was feeling too hot, I can adjust and open out the bundle as much I want. And it can be use until 3 or 4 years old."
63033,0,"So I was hopeful after reading these reviews, that if I called Medela I could get the tubing for free. I spoke with Lisa at customer service who was polite. I told her the tubing connector part came off the tube, which it did, and I need to order replacements. She took all my info, then told me it would be $10 plus the cost of s&h!! I told her that it was cheaper on amazon.com so I would just buy it there. She was stunned. I said, so, no need to process the order then. Goodbye. I can't believe some people got these for free!! GOOD LUCK!"
179459,1,"I think this was one of the best purchases I made before moving out of state. We travel by plane several times a year now and this is a must for parents traveling with a carseat that you are taking onto the plane. We have 2 little boys, and I cannot imagine traveling without it. I am very pleased that it has held up well for a year's worth of travels...approximately 10 flights."
70609,1,"My son is 4 months now and he's had it since he was a little less than a month old, and he likes it. The vibration is nice on it, and the middle toy makes noise, which most babies love. Plus you can make it stationary and lay it back for sleepy babies. And when they get older, they can use it for a rocking chair, without the toys. The only complaint i have with it is the vibration box has vibrated it loose, so it makes an annoying noise when you turn it on. But my little man loves it :)"
14618,2,"I bought these thinking that they would be an easy transistion to breast feeding my twins. I could not have been more wrong. The bottles were nothing but a leaky mess. I nipples & lids would not seal right. After a week I gave up and went with the playtex nurser. The liners are a bit of a hassle, but well worth not getting drenched every feeding. I used the playtex disposables with my first baby and they worked great then. I don't know why I tried something different. I should have stuck with what I knew worked."
29606,1,"This mobile really helped get our baby to sleep in the first few months AND the music was pleasant enough not to drive my husband and I crazy. If she fussed when we put her down, the mobile soothed her and she was out in no time. Also, the remote was very handy- although if we hadn't used the mobile in a day or so, the remote wouldn't work to activate it. We would have to turn it on at its base before the remote would work again. Very wierd- but it really wasn't a problem for us. Overall, I would suggest this mobile to anyone. It's very cute and it was a great aid to us."
3818,2,"I am taking this back ASAP..my 3 month son and I both hate it. I really love the idea of it, but it just didn't work for us. One of the reasons I bought it was because it played music, but it only lasts for 5 seconds. Seriously, how is that long enough to be able to put ""musical"" in the title? The pillow is pointless because it's so small. He liked the mirror and the toucan, but they only kept him entertained for maybe a minute before he became fussy with those also. For nearly $40, this just isn't worth it..to me at least."
182634,1,This accessory is a must have for the Joovy stroller that has no storage otherwise. Came in very handy during our trip to Disney.
109304,1,"These were amazing for my teething son!! He just got two teeth and wants to chew on anything and everything, I throw a cube of ice in it or part of a frozen banana and it keeps him occupied and happy, until its all gone! :)"
171688,1,"When had orginally registered for a tub that was supposed to &quot;fold&quot; away nicely...that tub wasn't much smaller folded so we returned it and decided on the Sure Comfort Deluxe. We love this tub...when our daughter was a newborn the hammock worked great, when she was a little older the reclining seat worked great, now at age nine months the toddler seat works great because she can sit completely upright (she started to not like the recline position at about 5 months). A friend of mine has a different baby tub that only has a reclining position and now had to go buy another tub so her son can sit upright! Who needs two baby bath tubs!!As far as the comments about the &quot;green safety plug&quot; not working...the plug in our tub does turn white when the water is too warm, however, we do not rely on this feature, nor should anyone else. Also, as far as though &quot;safety&quot; ducks, etc, that have the word &quot;HOT&quot; on them that turns white when the water is too warm...the couple of safety ducks we received as gifts have always said HOT even when we placed them in lukewarm-to-cold water. And now, nine months later, permenantly say &quot;HOT&quot; Myself along with a couple of my other mom friends all have permenantly &quot;HOT&quot; safety ducks..ha, ha.."
10241,1,"I read the reviews of the many, many potty seats out there before I bought this one. It was the ONLY one with good reviews and figured that was my best bet. I couldn't be happier. It fits on the elongated toilet seat which apparently others do not. (Apparently Baby Bjorn also makes one that is rounder and I saw people complaining about those not fitting. I think you just need to make sure to buy the one with the longer depth if you're looking for the elongated fit.) My daughter has no problems using it and has already started going potty in it. Very easy to use and transport and just a great fit for us."
149058,1,"This pillow does everything I wanted it to to. It's very convenient because you can simply roll from side to side without having to take it with you. I'm pretty short (5'2"") and for me, each side of the pillow is like a full length body pillow. I also use my own pillow... I slept with 2 pillows before anyway, so now I use the curved top portion of this Leachco pillow as my 2nd pillow underneath, and still have my pillow on top of that for my sleeping purposes. It works out great. The pillow is quite large, but in a queen-sized bed it fits fine with me and my hubby.Only warning... make sure you have patience (or someone who does) before you remove the pillowcase! It is nearly impossible to get back on and I always have my husband do it for me after I wash it. :)"
54997,1,"Excellent product. Easy to use, easy to clean. My two-year-old Son LOVES it!"
71616,1,"I thought this was so cute because I was looking for a hamper to put all of my daughter's dirty clothes in & even though she's only 7 months old, she has a lot of clothes and I hadn't been able to get her one, yet. so, I bought 2 of these: one for her dirty clothes and one for her toys because she has a lot of toys, too. it's a little bit shorter than I thought it was gonna be but it makes up for that lost height with the width. I like how it has a zipper on top, that's really cute and it holds a lot of clothes. I would buy this again and I definitely recommend it."
377,2,Buying Pampers or Huggies is flushing your money down the toilet. Luvs work just as well at a fraction of the cost.
29579,0,"I bought this mobile, assembled it, and it did not work. Mine too would not rotate. I took it back and got another, however it did not work either. Instead I had to pull on one of the smaller birds and it finally began to move. I could hear the mechanism trying to turn at first, but it would not. I have an 11 week old who really loves the mobile, however I was not happy about all the problems. I am going to keep it, but do think the company should pinpoint the problem."
103406,0,"I've had the gate for approx. 6 months, loved it until the locking mechanism broke. Now it's more a hazard - try climbing over it when it won't open to get out of the house during an emergency. Written to the company, hopefully they'll respond. Hope all that have one with broken mechanisms write too."
70696,0,"We originally got this as an alternative to my dd's much loved bouncer, but it couldn't compete. In those early months she wasn't strong enough to rock it herself, and the vibrations were too strong (should have seen the look!) So she just sat there and quickly complained. We kept it around and about the time she started walking it became interesting - a challenge to climb in and out by herself, then a challenge to turn the vibrator on. Now she puts her stuffed animals in it and tucks them in. So it's getting use, although the toy bar never did. I suspect I could have gotten a little rocker for less money, though."
81729,0,I purchase this changing pad because it looked much safer than the typical contour because it has all four sides and I was quite pleased when it arrived.......very well padded and deep in the center. The only problem that I have with this purchase is the fact that the manufacturer does not make covers for the cocoon changing pad and the covers can not be found anywhere......I looked online for two days before I finally decided to make one myself but for those that do not sew it would be very difficult to cover!
22412,1,"Like another reviewer, we got this for when our new granddaughter spends the day with us. It was really easy to set up, even with the added time of reading the directions, which are clear and well written. One of the things that led me to choose this one is that I'm just 5' and having to reach into a full-sized playpen is hard, but the depth on this is just perfect. I don't think anyone else mentioned that there are wheels on one end, so if you want to move it around the room, etc., you just lift the other end slightly and you can roll it anywhere you want. It seems really well made, the price is excellent and I can't wait for baby Emma to try it out!"
5765,1,This product works very well! I must say it takes a little for me to remove the outlet plug so I know for sure my 10 month old will not!
80445,1,"This has been one of the best investments I have made so far for my daughter. It is big enough for the huge carts and also works on the small ones, and it works for resturant highchairs too!! Also it has the attached bag that can be used to store the cart cover or you can put diapers, toys, or your wallet inside so you dont have to carry so much stuff in the store the cover has alot of little pockets for keys bottles toys ect, I love this thing its great, and its much nicer then some of the other brands!!"
89190,1,Got here a few days later than expected but Ive used Pampers for awhile. NOT good for little babies but GREAT for toddlers. NOT a good fit but much more absorbent than Huggies. I reccomend Huggies for up to 18 mos. about 12 mos and up i reccomend pampers
35643,1,"I was a little concerned about purchasing this bag after reading some of the other reviews. However, I went ahead and purchased it, and I am so glad that I did. The bag is really beautiful. I purchased the pink paisley print and the picture online doesn't do it justice. I am not sure what bag the other individuals received, but my bag has a zipper under the flap, the stroller straps, and the shoulder strap. The material is very soft and a really great quality. This bag was a great deal and a fantastic find, considering I paid half price."
168949,1,These are the best diapers - and I have been using these since my daughter was born. The mesh lining in the diaper is fantastic and we haven't had any incidents of diaper rash yet!
170445,1,"I originally had the Chicco carseat/stroller combo set for my infant but she soon passed over the 22lb limit and I had to immediately upgrade to a larger convertible seat. I read a ton of reviews and found Britax the best around... then it became a hunt for the best price. I found this unit on Amazon and saved almost $89 for this one alone! I got lucky since I Have a girl and the pink one was less then all the rest.It was super easy to install, very easy to get her in and out of the car. The only complaint is that it is a big tall so you have to duck to get into any SUV i have been in. But its ok for now; as she gets older she may have to bend a bit more.I have only used it rear facing so I can only rate it based on this, been an awesome seat and I would recommend to anyone. I have recommended it to several friends which one did purchase the same but in blue for her son.We both love our seats!"
30480,1,We got this tub as a baby shower gift and couldn't be happier. Our baby is 11 months old and we still use it. She loves to play with the little cups that comes with the tub. The net was a very convenient way to bathe her until her umbilical cord came off.
42154,1,Originally I wanted one of the more decorative hampers but I am glad I went with this one. It is super convenient and easy to clean....think machine wash :-). It folds easily if you decide you don't want it out for some reason and it has an interior bag which doesn't collapse from the weight of a hefty bundle of clothing. It is also an ample size comparable to the majority of larger baby hampers. It might not be appealing to some beacuse of its plain look but I keep mine in the corner next to my crib. It is definitely worth the price.
105789,1,"Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$. In just a few months use, the Diaper Champ pays for itself by saving money on costly refills needed for other brands. I have never had an odor problem, but I have a 5-month-old breastfed baby, so I know her diapers now are not as stinky as they will get once we go to solids. I also use the Glad ""Odor-Control"" bags (the price of 100 bags is probably about the same as a DG RF and will last over a year). The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags. I highly recommend it."
26547,0,"I bought this bassinet for my 1st daughter before she was born. It is very attractive however after having it and using it I see the problems with it. For one thing if u want to store this bassinet for use with a diff child later as we were planning on. Remember to consider that b/c this thing is a pain to store. It doesnt fold down at all or anytihng so unless u've got lots of space you might consider one that is collapsable or something which I failed to consider. Also the music on the thing is terrible the sound quality couldnt be worse. It like listening to nails on a chalk board so we dont use that either. Also if u need to take off the skirt and hood part of the bassinet to wash it then u are in for a big ordeal b/c u have to take part of the bassinet apart just to wash it!! A major pain. Also if u want more sheets that fit it and match you have to contact the company, which I never did. You can't buy them in the store so thats pretty annoying. I never had a problem with the bassinet tipping so I am not sure what everyone is talking about. When my daughter used it she was perfectly happy and in the middle of the bassinet as she was supposed to be. So it worked but upon reflection I would buy a diff one. But unfortunanlty I am stuck with this one again to use for my 2nd daughter. So over all I'd say buy something different if these things will bother u! After all its not a really cheap one so i dont tihnk i should have to deal with any of these issues!"
9750,1,"Very happy! Its a must have if you have a boy! This potty is simple and sturdy, gets the job done!"
21020,1,"I have all the items for this particular set. The colors, the shapes of the vehicles and the patterns are all precious! This will add the final touch to any baby boy's room. The great thing about it ( which sold me ) is the fact that it won't become outdated and will be something my son will enjoy for more then a few months! You won't go wrong!"
84646,1,"This is a great product -- easy to slip through the stroller harness and isn't too heavy. It machine washes easily and is designed so it doesn't drag on the ground no matter how much a baby likes to kick. No more running over those cute blankets with the stroller! The zippers come up high enough so your baby can keep his hands covered, but free -- no more lost mittens, socks, binkies, etc."
85018,0,This is a good diaper bag. It is a nice big size and extremely easy to wipe off if you get something on it.
143076,2,"Both have sturdy frames and almost full reclining backrests, but Quest is the big winner. With more features (and a rain cover), Quest is about 1 lbs lighter than the Swift.The Swift pushes less smooth than Quest, The handle bars are angled too up-right, so it's easy to kick the wheels when pushing, unless you extend your arms all the time (sore!)A real pain! Quest doesn't have the problem.The look through window on Swift's canopy is on the back, unless the seat is reclined, you have to bend down to see baby. While Quest has the window on the top and a nice mesh pocket on the back of the canopy.Swift's seat is narrower than the Quest's, padding is not as nice, especially on the sides. Swift has no extended leg rest.To open the Swift, you need one hand to hold the stroller frame, the other hand to open the clip. While with the Quest, you need only one hand to push the clip open (there is a spring)The real color of the Swift is not as bright and bold as in the picture. Quest has a higher-class look. And it truly is better than the Swift"
18594,1,"I bought these for myself after trying one to remove makeup at one of my beauty stores. My skin immediately loved them! I could not believe it! I have rosacea, oily skin and sensitive skin; with that being said, a product has to be superb in all the areas for my skin to like it. Did I mention I'm also sensitive to strong scents? I loved everything about this wipe that I had to have them. I'm glad they sold this item there; I hate it when they use certain products, and when you inquire about them the response is ""I'm sorry those are not for sale"". I went in there getting a specific item, and walked out of there with that and my Mustela facial cleansing cloths! To see my skin calm, comfortable, and moisturized makes me happy!"
90523,1,"This product is great and cheap. I love it, my baby love it. Would recommend. I can change my baby diaper every 4-5 hours without worry since she was 6 months until now 13 months."
8827,1,"This product is much more effective when used for children 3 and over. They have lost any interest in just pulling the pieces off out of curiosity. As long as the pieces are left on the table, this is a very useful product."
148787,2,"Hi,I am from Australia I've purchased a Back 'n Belly original pillow for my wife a few days ago from Amazon US.However she finds the seam in the 'U"" part of the pillow is digging into her neck when she sleeps on her side :( .A quick search in Google shows that a lot of people also complaining about the same problem, I also found out that the improved ""chic"" version eliminates this issue.What I don't understand is why Leachco still selling the product that has the ""digging"" issue when you already have the version that eliminates the problem, so people can buy the not so good product and while some is not affected by it others will be greatly affected?Their customers shouldn't have to research which of your Back N' Belly pillow is better the original or the ""Chic"".They should be able to buy one Back N' Belly pillow and that should be the one without the issue that Leachco have acknowledged and rectified in the improved ""Chic"" version. IT JUST DOESN""T MAKE ANY SENSE.I used to associate Leachco brand with quality pillows and not so much anymore.Anyway, enough rant as there is nothing that can be done except for trying to re-sell it here locally as it will be too expensive and difficult to return to the US and a ""Chic"" replacement cover will not fit the original pillow.Overall I'm very dissapointed.Thanks for listening,"
36376,0,"So I just got this pillow as a gift. I had never seen it before so my initial reaction was.. there's no option for pillowcase covers? Now I'll have to have a giant white thing on my well coordinated bed. Also, the zipper is one of those huge plastic zippers, and since the pillow is so thin, I keep hitting the zipper. Other than those 2 things, it's super comfortable so far.."
74166,1,"This is a great product, that fills a very specific need. If you buy this expecting a stroller that two kids can take a nap in, you will be disappointed. The back sit/stand section is small, and gets even smaller if you recline the front section. But for a 3-5 year old, it works, especially if they like standing up.It is most useful in places like Disney, etc, where the older kid is going to be walking sometimes, riding others, and getting on/off a lot. It is very easy to steer, still worse than a good single stroller, but the short wheelbase makes it a lot better than full size doubles. Quality is very good, especially for the price, and the folding/unfolding process is easy.As long as you are comfortable with the limitations, I highly recommend this as a smaller double stroller option."
175042,1,"I love this tub. I have used it for my son since he was born, first with a bath sling inside for sponge baths, then filling with water and him on the sling, then when he could almost sit up we just sat him in the corner and he leaned against the back. Now I am sooooo sad that he is almost 2 and getting too big for the tub. I tried recently to put him in the tub without it and he was NOT happy. He loves it too. I never have to worry about him trying to stand up and slipping and falling due to the big tub is just too slippery for little toddlers. I did get one hole in the tub (my fault, I was careless) but it was easy to patch up and has held up for two years. I plan to keep using it for our new baby coming in a few months. Wouldn't bathe baby any other way, and I give this as a gift for all all baby showers I go to."
36912,1,It fits brytax B-agile stroller. Brytax's cover is ridiculous expensive. This one is a great substitute.Just hope it can be a little bit clearer.
68509,1,I have the Graco Duoglider and I just bought this for my mother-in-law since she has my 5 month and 17 month old girls while I am at work. I am so jealous and now I want one for myself. It is lightweight and pushes so much easier than the duoglider. Now that my youngest can sit upright this is a much better stroller for me. At first I was scared by the price and after trying to buy a used one on Ebay I finally decided to buy a new one because this stroller has a great resale value. They sell for over $200 used on Ebay which is the same investment as buying the Duoglider at over $150 which may not hold up enough for resell later.
16563,1,"Lambs and Ivy manufactures quality bedding. I am really happy with the quality of it. You can't beat the price here on Amazon, I looked at a number of other websites and they were all going for $150. The 10 piece included the six piece bumper, crib sheet, comforter, bed skirt, valance, diaper hanger. The other four pieces were the lamp, small rug, and two rolls of border. This is worth the money and it is so pretty!"
92933,1,"This cot is very nice, except there is a strap right in the center that can be a bit uncomfortable if the bed isn't completely pushed down. And even then, it is right in the center of my little girls back. But, it is a nice cot. I may just get a cushion to put on top."
87831,1,"We got this for our baby when she was a ocuple weeks old, and we would put her on it everyday for a half hour or so and she LOVED it. She would just stare at the toys in total amuzement. She is 7 months old and is getting bored of it because she would rather be rolling around and sitting-up. This was a great toy to buy for our baby."
90758,1,We found that we could buy diapers from Amazon when looking for larger sizes for my grandson who has brain damage. Now we buy all diapers for all the grandchildren . The subscribe and save is awesome. Diapers delivered to the door. No shipping. You can cancel anytime or change size. I have done both. If you don't use this service you are losing a lot of money.
15651,1,"I orginally purchased this when my husband was deployed and the baby was about 5 months old and wanted to be held constantly. I have used several different backpacks and slings, and this is my favorite. Although a bit tricky to get the kid on the back by myself when he was older, many a trips in a store or laundry being folded has benefited. (You can use on your back, stomach, or side and the back has just been easier to free my hands). My husband is now home and the baby is 19 months old and we still find we use it around town shopping, especially at his naptime. I would absolutely recommend this above all other's."
142653,1,"When I had my first child I went to a breastfeeding class taught by the famous Kathleen Huggins (writer of The Nursing Mother's Companion). Kathleen swore by the My Breast Friend pillow. I thought a Boppy would do just fine or even an old fashioned pillow... Not so. The only thing that worked with my son those first few months was the My Breast Friend pillow. I tried to breastfeed without it and I ended up crying along with my son. I tried for an extended period of time and my son ended up loosing too much weight... All the lactation consultants (3 of them) told me I had ""great position"" without the pillow but it was the My Breast Friend pillow that made the whole experience better. This pillow is the only thing you need if you plan on breastfeeding."
132826,0,"This is a fantastic product! My son is 3 1/2 months old, and I'm still on the refill the machine came with. Here comes the BUT... Now that I am nearing the end of the refill I need to buy more. Well here lies the problem! You can't buy them in any store. I have been to every Babies R Us, and every Toys R Us in the state of CT, and none of them have the refill in stock. They say that they have been waiting months for them to come in! My whole thing is that I REFUSE to pay shipping on an item that should be avaliable in the stores!!! I have reciently discovered that Target.com sells them, and I'm going to go see if the store also has it. Overall this product it fantastic! I use it for my sons diapers, and as a trash can in his room. I never smell anything unless I throw the diaper in it. And even then it is only for a few seconds and it is only a hint of smell. If you don't mind purchesing the refills online, them this product is fantastic, and highly recommended!!!!"
162020,1,"Contrary to the negative reviews, I've had no problems at all with this tub. However, I used the sling in my kitchen sink or in the plastic tub and only used the tub in our bathtub. I can't say if it leaked or not.I didn't fold the tub down into the smaller size to store. Once assembled, we left it in the full size and just stored it upside down on an angle in the bathtub when not in use.The seat area ring was wonderful for us. However, I used it only when my child could sit upright. The blue &quot;ring&quot; fit in securely. She did fine and never injured herself.Only when she was about 14 months of age, did I stop using this tub and begin just filling water into our bathtub for her."
103410,1,"We purchased this gate to use at the top of the stairs to keep our two 65-lb dogs on the same floor of the house as us. We searched long and hard to find a gate that actually bolted into the wall and wasn't made out of some flimsy/cheap looking plastic. This is a very well made gate and meets both of our criteria (its made mostly of metal, with only the latch/knob and a few minor pieces made of sturdy plastic.)I gave this gate 4 out of 5 stars, because the lock mechanism is a bit tricky. (Keep in mind, the gate can be installed to swing in both directions, or only one - which was our choice.) If I'm trying to PUSH the gate open, it is easily accomplished with one hand (for those of you reading this review as a BABY gate). If I'm trying to PULL it open, I find a need to use two hands. The easy work around for me is to reach OVER the gate and twist the knob from the 'wrong' side and push it toward myself.Overall, I'm very pleased with this and am considering getting a second for the basement stairs."
176587,1,"When I was creating my registry, I made sure to register for SEVERAL types of bottles. This was my husband's idea because when his ex-wife had his first child they ended up having to buy many different types of bottles just to find one that made her comfortable. These were the only ones I received off my registry. My daughter was fine with them, but after a few other people tried to feed her and said they didn't think she liked her bottles, I gave in and tried several other brands. THESE WERE THE ONLY ONES SHE LIKED!!! The pre-formed collapsible liners are wonderful. She gets very little gas with them. I would highly recommend these to anyone."
17253,0,"I absolutely LOVED this monitor until after just a few months, our monitor quit working. The sound still works great (I can hear our daughter breathe), but now the monitor just has a line down the center of the screen. Before it quit working, the picture was good and we really liked being able to see our daughter during her naps. The manufacturer responded promptly to my email, but told me it would cost $53 plus shipping for them to fix it!!! I might as well go buy another for that price. Even though I loved this product when it worked, it did not work long enough for me to justify buying a new one."
7820,1,"This is a small sanitizer that works well to sterilize pacifiers and teething items, or other SMALL things your child may touch. It takes 30 minutes for one cycle to run, and uses dry heat, so you can sterilize small toys and things you would not put in a dishwasher or washing machine. It is not designed to sterilize bottles or bigger items."
174887,1,"With two toddlers, I've been through more than my fair share of waterproof mattress pads over the years. This is the best one I've found. It washes so well. The pad and backing elastic are sturdy and (unlike others we've had) have not shown any wear. The pad has a little extra padding so that it seems ""fluffy"" but once the kids were 6 months old, I wasn't worried about it and they both preferred this pad to the others. It is so soft that sometimes I find it hard to believe that it is waterproof...but we've done plenty of testing, it's waterproof! Ignore the negative reviews and pick this pad."
82675,1,"Before buying this product, my 3-month-old daughter would cry in the carseat almost all the time. Now, I can turn this on before leaving the house, and she'll fall asleep on the way to the car. Then, she actually stays asleep for the car ride! I can transfer her from the car to her stroller or shopping basket, and she still sleeps. If I needed to, I could strap this to her crib as well. I use the stream sounds for her, but I think the rain or ocean sounds would do just fine. The whale sounds are a little weird though. When I first heard about this product and was looking to buy it, I read all the amazing reviews on here, and I feared my daughter would be the only baby in the world this didn't work for. I now tell people this has to be the best $22 I've ever spent."
162756,2,"The lids on these containers are ridiculously rough, and actually hurt my sons hands when he would try to reach in for his snack. I even tried it, and really does hurt. The lid needs to be made of a softer rubber, like that of the munchkin brand containers."
60225,1,"I hesitated a little to buy this tub due to its size, but I can't even begin to tell you how glad I am that I added it to my registry! I've been using it since my daughter was born & now, at 4 months, 24.5"" and 13 lbs, she is nowhere close to outgrowing this sucker! And it's so easy to bathe her. She is supported so well that both of my hands are free to wash her....something very important for a first-time parent, in my opinion. And the Sure Comfort Newborn-to-Toddler Tub (http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/ref=br_1_1/602-0686400-4931012?%5Fencoding=UTF8&frombrowse;=1&asin;=B000067EH7) that I bought to keep at my inlaws house further reinforces my love of the Eurobath. I used it (Sure Comfort) for the first time at Thanksgiving when my daughter was not quite 3 months old & HATED it. She was already outgrowing it & I couldn't wash her hair without taking her out of the tub. That made her very unhappy! With the Eurobath, I can wash her hair while leaving her in the tub. I just use a little toy bucket to pour water over her hair, scrub, & rinse...all without spilling water everywhere while she's still comfortably seated in the tub.And as far as the size is concerned....yes, it's big. However, the one end of the tub has a hole in it. I bought a heavy duty picture hanger & mounted the hanger on the wall, just above the tile, inside the shower of the guest bathroom (it's a full tub/shower). This way, I can hang the tub up on the wall & it's out of the way, allowing use of the shower w/ the tub still in there. Works out great!This product receives 2 thumbs up...and then some!"
35414,1,Hilarious! My daughter even spits out other pacifiers to take this one. Gave everyone a good laugh Christmas morning! Nice and cheap too!
103108,0,"Pros: good suction to tub & ultimately keeps kid safe.Cons: seat is slippery & kids slide forward, crushing little boys' private area. Also, the toys are not really that easy to play with...more just for looks."
26268,2,"I was hoping that I would be able to use this like a backpack, but it only had one trap( It would have worked much better if you could carry it like a backback). It was impossible to push a stroller with two hands and keep the car seat from fall off my shoulder. If I tried to hook it on the stroller it would drag on the ground. It just made the car seat that much more bulker. Granted, if you have others to help you, it is nice to be able to pack other things in with the car seat,as there is ample space. I will be traveling alot this summer, and I won't use this product again."
109696,2,"I have 3 month old twins and every time we have to go out using these car seats I get frustrated with the design. The dual clips mean that you really need 3 hands to get it done up properly. The problem may be that I have cozy liners in with the car seat, however, I live in cold Alberta and these are a necessity in winter, and the seat should be able to accomodate that. Also, my biggest frustration is that the triangle shape of the clip means that it digs into my babies' thighs every time we do it up which means we have to jostle them around to get them into a position where it isn't going to hurt them. Once the babies are in the seat, you have to dig around underneath them to even find the clip. The nice thing is that they easily attach to the base in the vehicle and are relatively easy to remove, though the release should be in the rear, not in the front wedged up against the seatback of the vehicle. A single clip into the middle would be my suggestion for the harness, not the two clip system. Overall, I would never buy this again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. I have 6 kids, but my other 4 used a different seat. I thought these items would improve, but it seems they were designed by a clueless engineer and not someone who has to use it in real life."
70443,2,"The minky material comforter is soft but the sheets are absolutely rough. I paid $145 with shipping and really feel robbed. I'm going to buy new sheets because I can't find a solid comforter in this shade. For this price, the sheets should be soft."
106807,1,"After reading through these reviews I knew I had to leave my own two cents. I can't believe some of the things others are complaining about!""Oh the trash bag stinks when you are changing it"" Well duh, it has 1 week old DIRTY DIAPERS in it!!!Some people are also saying that you can smell the dirty diapers as soon as their kids started solids, well I've had my Champ for 8 months, my son is 9 months old and let me tell you, he lets some real bombs go! But I can't smell a thing with the Champ. I can't imagine what those other kids diapers smell like that they leaking out of the Diaper Champ! Besides that, We are talking about dirty diapers, try ripping your septic tank out of the ground, put it in your living room and see how wonderful your crap smells!One person said ""Poo Poo diapers when not put in the lid properly, gets the Champs lid soiled"" Well duh! Put the ""poo poo"" diapers in the right way and you won't have that problem!And last but not least, someone said that this pail wasn't big enough and that she was changing the bag too often. Well, how big of a trash can would you really want? Would one the size of your child's crib be big enough? And about having to change the bag often, once again we are talking about DIRTY DIAPERS!!! You should be changing the bag every few days or at the very least once a week!I just found some of these comments quite funny. Seems that some of these ladies are expecting ""it all"" with this diaper pail. Well the truth is that this is a great pail, you can use regular trash bags so not only is the diaper pail itself quite inexpensive, you also don't have to buy expensive refills, the smell is very little to none at all, and it IS big enough. What's not to like? Five stars from me!"
131230,2,"I bought this because I love the look of it and thought my daughter would enjoy a personal sized blanket. It is a beautiful blanket and very soft but if your baby is a chewer, then the fuzz from the ""Cotton Candy"" blanket will come off in their mouth. Also, the satin border is much stiffer than I expected. I bought a Little Giraffe chenille blankie that I am much happier with now!"
157274,1,"I have such a difficult time breastfeeding that it is near impossible for me to do it without crying. After seeing tons of lactation consultants I finally decided to pump all of my sons feedings. I was given a slightly older model of the Pump in Style Original and was not very comfortable. So I rented the Medela Symphony for a month ($90 + starter kit). That pump was amazing but at 90 a month not so practical. So I bought the PiS Advance. Although it's not as efficient as the hospital grade Symphony this pump does an amazing job. It's much quiter than the original and has the 2 phase suction. Not only is the 2 phase suction more efficient, I have found that the initial short suck phase preps my body for the more intense longer pulls that follow. For most I'm sure the original is fantastic but if you're very sensitive the Pump in Style Advance is what you need (unless you want to shell out $90 a month. The Symphony retails at around $1250.00. OUCH!) Good Luck!"
65843,1,"My husband and I LOVE this mixer - we first used the Munchkin one, but didn't like that you had to constantly hold down the button to make it work, with this one you just flip the switch and it stays on. We use this to make a big batch of formula for the day (daycare mandates we have all bottles pre-made for the day) and it works well. I like that it helps mix the formula and that there are no clumps left so there is no need to shake the bottles when you're done - so I know the nutrients are distributed evenly/correctly. This is worth the money!**After 2 months of use, though, the first one we purchased broke - not sure how/why, but the mixer came out of unit when we were using it, so we have since purchased a replacement. Hopefully this doesn't happen again.*******EDIT: Now the second one has broken as well - it starts making a very high pitched whining sound and then the ""mixer"" comes out of the ""base"" while you're using it (while it's turned on) and all we're doing it mixing powder formula and water in a mixing bowl - we are not touching the sides or the bottom of the bowl*****"
67115,0,We purchased this for our daughter for when she sleeps over her grandparents house. It's made from press board and flimsy wood solids. Your child will quickly out grow this so if you really want it shop around and find a good price.
126199,1,Much less expensive than at any retailer. Buying diapers at K-Mart or Target is a non-sense from now on. Provided Amazon keeps the prices that low. Go for it. It's pure common sense.
89604,1,"These diapers are ok, the only drawback is when just a little urine is in them they sag so bad. So I switched to pamper's cruiser's."
88732,0,"Pampers were great when my liitle ones were little, but not so much as they are getting older. They dont hold as much. They are still great diapers but just not for my girls as they have gotten to that age where they pee a LOT"
55231,1,"The Potty Stool is a wonderful stool. It is high enough for a young toddler to reach the toilet (though it could be just a bit higher for really young ones like 18mo) and the rails make toddlers feel *so* secure. They don't just feel secure, they really are secure.I tried three other types of stools. They were all bad accidents just waiting to happen. I tried the Bjorn type stool (too small & short to work, too light to stay in place); the Mommie Cushie stepup (terribly unstable); and the KidKraft wooden step stool with lid (sturdy, tall enough, heavy enough to stay in place, but might slip on tile, might be slippery when wet, no rails). With the exception of the KidKraft, I wasted my money on everything.This stool is worth every penny when compared to safety issues of all the other stools. It is utterly safe, sturdy, and reassuring to toddlers. The rails come off easily for cleaning, and the stool can be moved easily just by squeezing the two rails together and picking it up. A great product."
133883,0,My toddler boy is 2 1/2 and even though I like the durability of this seat. . .the splash guard just isn't high enough. He ends up going all over the floor. I think my solution will be to have him pee on it backwards (which he'll eventually have to learn anyways). I also don't think this product is worth the money. I've seen similar products for under $10. Good luck to all you potty trainers out there!
86079,2,"If all you are looking for is a great color/night vision video monitor, this is your device. However, if you want to be able to listen in on your baby as well, this is not the way to go. I was very excited to have this monitor until I plugged it in. I have tried to use it in my home, my parent's home, and now our new home in another city and in all three places the video worked great, but the sound mechanism put out a very loud static that prevented us from ever hearing the baby (yes, I tried it on both the A and B channels in all locations). Friends of ours who also have this same device have the same issue. We think that maybe the wifi we have in our homes could be interfering with the sound mechanism, but for $135+ that should not be an issue. I have not used other video monitors, so maybe they are all like this, but I would not buy this for or recommend it to any friends or family members."
156011,1,"I use this for my dogs when they're teething.Most dog toys have a squeaker in them, and the sound can get really annoying if you're trying to get some work done. Or sleep. This is a great alternative to squeaky dog toys. The plastic is durable, but the rubber part does tend to flake when exposed to tiny needle-like fangs. It's small enough for a tiny puppy mouth, and the bendy feature allows him to chew on it with his back teeth/gums. He goes at it for hours with a silly, satisfied look on his face, and I'm thrilled that he isn't chewing on my stuff."
135490,2,"I bought this set hoping that despite the low price, it would work based on the reviews on this site. Well, not for us- we get horrible static reception/feedback despite moving the monitors to several different areas in the house. I really like the light sensor option on the front, and wished these would have worked out for us. And yes, battery hogs they are- I think my batteries lasted a day and a half with the monitor being on maybe a few hours each day, before they went out. I'll be returning this back to Amazon..."
168240,1,"I've been using Pampers for a while now -- our daughter is nearing her 1 year milestone. These daughters are pretty much leakproof -- we have had 0 blowouts so far (crossing my fingers). We did purchase some Huggies diapers and found 1 leak out of a pack of about 42. Still, given our larger sample size of Pampers, we prefer the Swaddlers over the Huggies Snug 'n Dry.Also, it is nice that they brought back the leak indicator stripe -- they had discontinued in on several of the Size 1 boxes we purchased. I now noticed that all of our Size 2 diapers have the indicator. Although I don't really need it now that she is bigger, it is much easier to check than feeling for puffiness in the diaper."
31206,0,"This was a great purchase for me when I found it. However, if I had continued to look online, I would have found another store with a wider selection of the sugar plum accessories at a better price."
73835,0,"I didn't realize the pediatrician was going to ask for detailed info on when the baby ate, how much, how many wet or poopy diapers, etc or I probably would have figured out that what we REALLY needed was a log sheet or book to record the info in. Yes, it's low-tech, but that way we have a few days worth of details to hand instead of just the last time we fed/changed him. I purchased this item myself because I thought it was such a must-have, but really.. not so much. Sure, it's handy, but not an essential."
115619,1,"This is by far our favorite diaper bag, and we have tried at least ten!This one we use for vacations by plane since it is concidered a diaper bag and doesn't count towards carry-on luggage. It's big enough to hold bottles and food, a change of clothes, diapers and anything else you need. It's definately too big for normal use though. We bought the smaller one, which we use as our regular diaper bag.It's nice to have one strap rather than two, since it's easy to put on and back-friendly. My husband likes the non-diaper bag look and the available colors don't clash with my clothes :-)This model has a neat compartment at the bottom to keep whatever-you-want in. It's where we keep toys, so my son can open this compartment but the rest are off limits. The insulated bottle compartment worked out wonderfully for us when my son was still on the bottle... just put some of those refreezable icecubes in the bottom...I recommend it 100%... We do have TWO! :-)"
126893,1,"Huggies are my favorite diapers, BY FAR. With the waistband in the back and good elastic around the legs, we rarely, IF EVER have leaks!"
91707,1,"I bought the double sun/insect mesh even though I only have one child in anticipation of the future. It works fine even with only one seat. It goes on pretty easily and my 2 month old can see out of it just fine.My mesh came with a missing snap in the back, but there seems to be no issues, we generally only snap the top snaps to keep it in place. And I do wish it had a flap to get to the baby easier. Overall it is a great product and I don't have to worry about my baby getting sunburned or bit by bugs while I am running."
67412,2,"When I first received this travel system, I absolutely loved it. I had done my research, read all the reviews and decided this was the one for us.I've had this stroller for 2 years now and I absolutely hate it. I never had a problem with the infant car seat - that met my expectations. The stroller is impossible to steer. I literally have to have two hands on it at all times to steer and it needs a little muscle to maneuver. It is soooo heavy. I am pregnant with baby #2 and I can't lift it into the trunk anymore. It squeaks like you wouldn't believe. I'm embarassed to take it out in public with all the noise it makes. Granted, it could probably use a little oil here and there but at this point it's not worth it to me.It does have it's pluses though - the parent tray is awesome. Cup holder & a little compartment to hold keys, phone, whatever. The storage underneath is also really nice and holds a ton of stuff.I'm looking forward to stroller shopping again that can accommodate two kids and hope I have better luck the second time around."
174164,1,"This swing is a MUST HAVE! We registered for this swing because of the color and the fact that it will swing both directions. We received this as a shower gift when my daughter was two months old and I could never have imagined how much she would LOVE it. She loves to watch herself in the mirror and watch the birds and leaves go around. She will fall asleep and stay asleep for hours! Also, the batteries last for a long time, considering how much it is on - the first four lasted over a month!Would definitely recommend this swing! The best gift we received by far!"
96998,0,"I ordered the sleep sheep to help my 3 month old son relax and fall asleep. The sheep is really soft and cute, and I like that you can set it to play the sounds for 23 or 45 minutes, and then it shuts off for you. So far, my baby really only likes the ocean sounds; the heartbeat, rain and whale sounds don't have any effect on him. The rain sound is kind of disappointing- it sounds a little fuzzy and staticky. And the whale sounds are really wierd- I never use that one at all. Overall, I'm still glad I bought it but it doesn't always work for my baby..."
78500,2,I bought the Medela pump thinking it was a good quality pump as well; however after only 3 months of use the suction was not working at all. I'm looking for a new replacement now. Don't invest money in this expensive pump.
115487,1,"This soap is great, if you have sensitive this is what to buy! The price was great also. It also has a delightful scent, not too strong."
85400,2,"no return, too high, very unsatisfied, should never buy this product. And most important thing is we cannot return this product and get our money back"
112501,1,"I have been using diapers for my kids for 4 years now, so I have tried them all over the years searching for a cheaper alternative. Pampers are by far the best and are worth the extra money because you won't have to use as many. They do not get hard or lumpy when full (Huggies), they do not break up when full and fall to the center (Costco brand), and they don't leak (most other brands). My second choice is Target Brand diapers, I use those when I can't find Pampers. I am now getting Pampers a little cheaper by doing the subscribe and save program - Amazon delivers a huge box right to your door every month... how great is THAT!!!?"
14992,0,"I used this feeding system since my son was born. As he grew I purchased the different nipples so he could drink more. The bottle system is great for less gas and they are easy to clean but for the price you pay, they should NOT begin to leak after just 1 year of usage. I was disappointed with this but I still used the ones that didn't leak. People say all you have to do is pull on the nipple, but I say, for the price you pay for these, you should have to do this."
155402,1,"There are a number of reviews indicating this is not really a two-pack. Despite that, I went ahead and ordered, confident Amazon would make it right. I did receive two complete two-sided signs in the box (maybe Amazon has corrected the problem since the original posts). They are exactly as advertized - corregated plastic (like cardboard but waterproof). They are light, but a small rock holds them in place. They're just the right size for my 3-year old to carry out to the curb anytime he's playing in the yard. They're small but clearly visible, reasonably tasteful, and since they can be put out and taken in tend to attract more attention than a permanent sign."
11916,2,"My sister-in-law bought this for me, and it was a lifesaver! My son stayed quiet while I cooked dinner. However, he's 10 months old, and likes to throw things on the floor. The green top breaks very easily, and my son has just broken the third top. I can't keep buying replacements for it--it's getting too expensive. The idea is excellent, but the product quality stinks, and I'm not buying another replacement, nor am I going to encourage any of my pregnant family or friends to buy it."
34133,1,This bag was great. Car seat fit perfectly and since we where going to a warmer climate we where able to fit three winter coats in with the car seat for the return trip. Would highly recommend this for anyone that travels with younger children. Great price.
32392,2,"I bought this because my older daughter had one just like it about 9 years ago. This clip is being used only when we go on car rides, so baby doesn't lose her pacifier. Well after about 4 months of occasional use the clip itself won't close all the way, so it doesn't secure to anything. Pacifier constantly falls onto the floor. Very disappointed as it's a cute design and it fit in her pacifier holder. Now its only purpose is to take up space in a landfill. Junk, do not buy!"
55880,0,"We got this as a shower gift and used it for about a week before we realized that our infant daughter didn't notice one bit whether we heated up the bottles or just served them at room temperature. (We discovered this by taking her out and just putting the formula in a bottle and giving it to her without heating it....she never noticed a thing.) Since then we've been too lazy to heat up the bottles. Basically, when my daughter is crying because she's getting hungry, it's much faster to just give her a room temperature bottle than have her work herself into a fit of crying waiting for a heated bottle."
78940,2,"I bought this to use on our recent Spring Break vacation. I'm a big baby travel gadget fan and own lots of various types of car seat carrier accessories bought from here and places like One Step Ahead. I was really excited about this after reading the rave reviews on Amazon. We did not intend to use this to carry my 9 month old; we only meant to use it to carry the car seat since I carry the baby on me with a baby carrier. Well, after using it on our last trip (from Chicago to Southern California and back), my husband refused to use it at the end, preferring to hand carry the Britax Roundabout. Why? Because the horizontal straps (imagine the top horizontal line of the ""T"") -- the one with a ring on each end -- is just a bit too short. We had two rolling carry-on size suitcases, an American Tourister with an expandable top that could add another three inches and a Samsonite. My husband had pulled the latch straps on the car seat out as far as they'd extend. No matter how he tugged things the Traveling Toddler straps (the side with two rings that goes around the body of the suitcase to hook onto each side of the carseat latch hook) was just a bit too short for the American Tourister -- presumably because the expandable top portion added another 1/2 inch or so in width, even though we had it zipped up to the smallest size. With the Samsonite, it was so snug that it'd take a good 5 minutes sometimes just for him to hook the straps on, and that is after doing a lot of adjustment and struggle. So imagine my husband's frustration with this each time we had to unhook and hook it -- after removal of the luggage from the shuttle/car into the airport, going through security, leaving security and going to the gate, getting on the plane (because it was tough to pull the carseat down the narrow aisles), off the plane gangway, etc. I told him I'll try to find some sort of extension or maybe try using some keychain rings to hook onto the D ring to extend the straps for our next trip; until then, he said we're not using this anymore. Seriously, for the price of this simple (but clever) contraption you'd think the maker could have made the straps a bit longer to accommodate thicker carry-on suitcases and car seats with shorter latch straps! The latch straps can always be adjusted to be a bit shorter/tighter, so it can't be a matter of safety to not add a bit more length -- even an inch would have helped -- to this Traveling Toddler strap. Right now I cannot recommend this for anyone with a big carseat like the Britax Roundabout or anyone with a carryon suitcase that is not on the thinner side. I gave this two stars because it deserves one star for the idea and another star for the fact that when we were able to squeeze one onto to the Samsonite, it was great to roll the carseat around instead of carrying it on our backs (via one of those backpack carseat carriers) or carrying it in another big bag (since we already has so many bags/cases)."
58362,1,"My infant son LOVES this lion mobile. Since he was about 4 weeks old, he stared at and studied the lion face. His changing table is now one of his favorite places because he ""talks to"" and smiles at that lion every time. Great investment."
146905,2,"We bought this for the kitchen to cushion a play area on our hardwood floors. I thought it was a total of 20 pieces (as the description says), but each square has at least 6 pieces. Unfortunately, my 8 month old easily figured out how to take it apart. It's cute, but wasn't at all what I thought and it was expensive to boot."
126884,0,More expensive than the store. If you buy them at Sam's you get more diapers for the same amount of money.
109148,0,"this tray is a great idea in theory, however, once your baby starts to move around and push things out of the way, this tray is useless. I made the mistake in purchasing this once my daughter was approx. 7 months old. At this point I wasn't able to use it. It comes off the bumbo relatively easily, so she knocked it off each time."
150155,1,"When my 4 month old showed interest in food, we wanted to give him fresh fruits but he would ""bite"" little pieces off the banana/apple and we were always worried about him choking on it. The Baby Safe Feeder has been the answer. We've put pieces of apple, mango, banana, peach, and my little one loves it. It also came in handy when he began teething, he was/is not fond of teething toys, he would much rather bite on his Baby Safe Feeder with a piece of frozen mango or grapes inside."
62986,1,"I have long searched for the perfect pillow and ended up spending hundreds for a pile of useless support pillows. I am nearly 31 weeks pregnant and had been using 5 pillows of various sized to support my hips/knees, belly, neck and to keep me from rolling onto my back. I found my army of pillows more useful than typical body pillows, ""J"" shaped body pillows, and foam wedges. The more pregnant I get, the more I have to get up at night to go to the bathroom and with so many pillows to arrange I would often lie awake for an hour waiting to get back to sleep.I love this support pillow because I can use my own head pillow. I have had multiple surgeries and specifically wanted a support pillow that would not force me to use it as my sole head support. Last night was the first night I used the Snoogle and it was the best night of sleep I have had in weeks. It is easy to position, reposition, and roll over with. It was so quick to position, that returning from my potty trips made getting back to sleep super easy. I am not accustomed to sleeping on my side and was able to stay on my side with this pillow. I did use my own head pillow and another pillow to hug to keep from collapsing my shoulders together, but I much prefer this set up than getting a bigger support pillow that may or may not fit me. I am only 5'3.There are other reviews that complain about the small size of this pillow, and I couldn't be happier. I am looking forward to restful nights for the remainder of my pregnancy. And the best part of all, is the price of this product. I have spent hundreds on Amazon for other pillows after extensive product review research, as well as at the Relax the Back Store. For me, this pillow gets an A+. I wonder now why I didn't buy it sooner."
93912,1,"This is my 3rd train table and I love it. The traditional kind has sides that don't allow a child to sit under it. The Nilo table is too tall (18.5"") to be used in place of a coffee table. This is perfect, 15"" height with slightly raised sides, corners are slightly rounded, drawers are handy with casters and if you have a low stool or short chair, your toddler can do art and puzzles on it too. It looks nice if you need to put it where your coffee table was or in your childs room. I debated btwn oak and natural and the oak looks good, no complaints for the price! It arrived quickly from BabyAge and in great shape."
86179,2,"I must have gotten a dud, because this thing only crackles and pops with intermittent audio. The video reminds me of 1950's TV pictures--with broken tubes. I am returning it. Its a real piece of junk."
99024,0,"Pampers are the best diapers, they are more thin and more soft than any other that I have tried. This product is a great buy, because you can't find them anywhere cheaper. However, it has been 5 days since I ordered them and they have not even been shipped yet. For that, I am very disappointed. I have never purchased from a merchant that has taken so long too ship."
159459,2,"My recommendation is do NOT buy this bouncy seat. We have twin girls and neither one of them have been able to sit in this. When we put them in, they fall to the side and can't get back up. When they were little, I put one of the girls in it, went to grab something, came back within a couple seconds and she was hanging over the edge. Luckily she was strapped in and the staps did work well, but it was still a scarry feeling to see my infant dangling off the side of this seat. It appears to lean forward too much and neither one of them could stay upright in them. Even now that they are sitting up almost completely on their own, if they lean over just a little bit they fall sideways and can't pull themselves back up. I would recommend the Fisher Price rocking chair that has a vibration mode on it as well. This rocking chair can also be used as a toddler. My girls have loved these chairs."
102526,1,"We bought this for our soon to be 4 month old daughter before she was born. This was money well spent. It is loud enough for her to hear, but not too loud that it keeps her awake. The Rainforest sounds are very soothing. I also like the little remote that comes with it so we can restart it if need be w/out going over to her crib and disturbing her. (once she sees us it's game over and she wants held) I strongly recommend this product."
67025,1,This bank is super cute! My little cousin just loved it and she has already started saving her money to buy herself a new toy!
36039,1,"This cup is #5 plastic (BPA free), recyclable, generally spill proof, and only TWO pieces! Plus, you don't have to worry about damaging or losing it, it weighs practically nothing, it is super affordable, easy to clean, and surprisingly durable. I put mine in the dishwasher all the time and am still using several a couple years old. In fact, I would say it is one of the BEST and CHEAPEST sippy cups at the same time. I have used every cup from Avent to Klean Kanteen, Sigg, Born Free, and every style and variety of the less expensive sippies on the market, and what it mainly boils down to this:IT ONLY HAS TWO PIECESMost spill or leakproof cups have multiple pieces to take apart and clean (up to FIVE for Born Free!) I want the drinking cup routine to be as quick and easy as possible. And having to fill water cups many times a day over the years can be wearing. The time I've spent searching for missing parts might easily add up to a month of my life.And like another reviewer said, it is perfect for situations such as bedtime, meals or in the car. This is not the best cup for the very early years or for older kids who love to throw or open them, but I would still recommend getting this cup because it is convenient and may often be the only clean matching set you can find (if you're like me). For my 'older' set of toddlers aged two and four, it is perfect.When I tip my sippies upside down, nothing comes out, but if I shake it, it does leak. This doesn't really bother me because I use it mostly for water. I even use it more often than my favorite Klean Kanteen sippies. To me this cup is definitely worth at least trying for the low price. You might save yourself a bundle in the long run by skipping the others.Also, it is not good for babies' proper jaw and palate development to suck too hard on bottles or sippy cups. But did you know that sipping out of a straw actually mimics breastfeeding and is *good* for jaw and palate development? Well, you can use the straw attachment to this cup for the first 18 months and then switch to the sucking lid. The straw lid is also surprisingly spill resistant.These are my fav sippies and they are all BPA free, easy to clean and more mold resistant lids:1) The First Years sippy cup in this review is by far the easiest to clean, affordable so you can stock up on these, only has two parts (cup and lid) and can be converted to a straw cup with lid. BUT it is not spill-, drop- or throw-proof.2) Playtex Lil Gripper Twist & Click sippies (the older spout kind, not the new straw kind which gets bad reviews) is truly spillproof, only has 3 parts and is durable.Playtex Lil' Gripper Spout Cup 2 Pack (Colors Vary)3) Klean Kanteen is truly spillproof, liquids stay fresher, it can be turned into regular drinking bottle, but it is expensive. It also has *4* lid parts, so why would you choose it over Sigg with only two lid parts? Well, Sigg leaks easier and can accidentally be left in the open position. Klean's lid is easier to clean because you can take it all apart and has a larger container opening. Klean Kanteen is recyclable. They also come in nicer colors now, but I don't see why they can't make the cute designs of Sigg! Cute counts for something too. :)"
13107,2,We bought this product thinking it would be a good choice for our sons car seat. Before we used it we went to a car seat event and found out this product and other after market products (products that do not come with your seat) are not tested. We were told it has the potential to be a good product but that it can be tightened too much causing the lever to break or it to get stuck on your belt. My advise get your childs seat professionally installed and only use what comes with your seat!!!
21961,1,I love this dresser...made with good wood easy to assemble i did it myself while i was 8 mnths pregnant...
55475,1,"This bottle warmer is great. We use it for every feeding and rely on it so much.The way it works is there is a measurement tube you use to fill with water. The amount of water you fill is based on how much formula is in the bottle. The warmer comes with a chart so you'll know how much water to use. We followed this chart at first but had to make adjustments to the measurement. After about 1 day of using it, we were able to get a feel of how much water there needs to be and when to pull it out from the warmer. No big deal, it just takes trial and error... you'll get the feel of it after about 2 feedings.So after filling the warmer with water, you put the bottle in and hit the button. The button has an orange light when it's on and automatically shuts off when it's done. If you leave the bottle in the warmer after it shuts off, it'll still be in the process of heating up. So the longer you leave it in, the hotter it will get. Like I said earlier, you'll get the feel of when you need to take it out.We use playtex angled bottles and this warmer supports it. I recommend this warmer."
104370,1,"Needed a tall gate to keep a Border Collie and Lab dogs from jumping over it. One that was not made of wood or plastic. they Chew those to pieces in a few hours. this gate has worked perfect. No chewing, no jumping. And I can go in and out with ease. Perfect and for a great price. Love it love it love it.Rita, SLC UT."
135770,2,At first this bottle was great. Then after about one month the bottles started leaking and the rubber piece that goes on the top part started to get mold on it. I was so dissapointed so I e-mailed doctor brown and they never responded. So I would never buy this bottle again
177858,1,"Low price, great quality and versatile design - We're think we can reuse it as a wet bar when the baby is done with it"
132751,0,"We've owned the Diaper Dekor Plus for about 15 months now. It's been great on odor control. The only time I notice any smell is when I put a diaper in and then only if the bag is getting really full.The refills last forever. I believe we've only gone through 2 boxes of refills in 15 months - so including the bag that came with the Diaper Decor, that's 7 bags total. Mind you, I do tend to be stingy with them and fill them as full as possible and use as little extra bag as possible when securing the ends during a change of bag.My main complaint though is in durability. We had the Diaper Dekor Plus just over 6 months when one of the hinges broke on the trap doors. It was just out of the warranty period but Diaper Dekor did send us a new trap door unit for free and in a timely manner. Now, after 15 months, the lid hinge has broken just from normal everyday use and it doesn't look replacable so it looks like we'll have to look for a new diaper pail.Overall, it controls odors really well (though we've sometimes had to work hard to get rid of the lingering odors in the plastic) but I'd say for how expensive it is, it isn't made to last as long as I'd hoped it would."
141768,1,"Very good product! Good quality, bright colors, replacing conventional walkers, my baby likes, a good brand. I recommend this product."
50899,1,"I bought this pillow last night, and already know that it was well worth the cost. I am 5'6"", and this pillow was perfect, but it would work for any height. After one night, my back pain was almost gone, after waking up for about a week with back pain. I'm 14 weeks, and I know the snoogle will only help me as I get bigger! I would recommend this to anyone, pregnant or not! It is a wonderful investment. My only complaint was that it says it has a removable, washable cover, but it looked somewhat difficult to remove, so I just put a normal pillowcase on the curled part where you put your head, and it worked fine."
95135,1,"I bought this for my wife on a recommendation from a friend. My wife's current breast pump was so painful to use, she wanted to give up and switch our daughter to formula. This Medela pump changed all that - we are still feeding our daughter breast milk (which is best) and both my wife and I can feed our daughter now!"
152040,1,This product comes in very handy when you are on the road and your kid needs a place to go. My daughter feels very comfortable considering it is an on the go potty.
106220,1,"I like the Diaper Champ. My little boy's room doesn't stink from dirty diapers. I empty it once a week, when it is time for trash pick-up. I like the fact of using regular trash bags instead of having to buy special bags. I do wipe it down a couple of times a month. I have also put in a box of baking soda to help absorb the odors inside. I highly recommend this product. It is very easy to drop in your dirty diapers."
116239,1,"This is a great product. Since we travel very often (domestic and international flights), these table toppers have done wonders. They are great for eating out(especially foreign country) as well as eating on the airplane during those long international flights. My third child is now 14 months old and I am still a loyal customer of the table toppers. I think all restaurant should provide the table toppers for infant/toddles. Afterall, the adults eat with plates, why should our children eat from the dirty table?"
147583,0,This hat seems very thick and well made but unfortunately my son never got to wear it (unless you count the one time I crammed it on his head!) as it runs VERY small. It's listed as 6-12 months but my son was 7 months old and couldn't fit into it. Since the lower band is pretty sturdy it does not stretch or mold at all. So I immediately gave it to a friend with a 4 month old!
41328,1,I love these diapers. I think they are the best size 3's on the market!!!
4923,1,"At roughly the same price as leading diapers, these are totally worth it for baby's health, for the earth, and for your time and life (vs. cloth), and your pocketbook."
96950,1,"This is a great tool for helping children sleep. The four sounds are very soothing.The issue I had is that the one that was sent to me seemed like it was a re-furb even though I bought it new. The stitching by the sound device crevice is coming apart all the way up to the sheep's head and the stuffing is therefore coming out! Otherwise, my son (1 year old) and I love it."
2144,1,Amazon has the BEST products for less. We had been ordering the Pamper Diapers from Amazon since the birth of my son. Diapers are much less than those found in the stores. I strongly recommend this product for Parents to buy for their young ones.
89808,1,The Baby Dry work much better than the Cruisers at keeping my twins dry. They don't have a problem with walking or crawling in them to need a different style. The Cruisers leak at night so these work better for us.
82485,1,"The dark brown blends in great with my fireplace and room decor. Very easy to install and seems to be sturdy so it will stay put and serve its purpose. Glad I spent the money on this one with the metal frame; no worries about it ""unsticking"" and falling off. Worth the price and I'd recommend it over all others out there."
164883,2,"These are terrible for night use. We used them at night for a week, and they leaked at least half of the nights. Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive are much better."
9035,2,"We're working on our second unit now. Both of them eat up the batteries like there's no tomorrow. The sound is terrible, even at a lower volume. The second unit that we got worked for about a day or two and now just shows an error message when you press play. My husband and I have had it! It's too bad Babies 'R' Us doesn't sell boom boxes. That is what we're going to use instead of this. What a shame and a waste of money."
441,0,"I subscribed this item. The first few package included the original Pampers recharges box. At this time the recharges box was NONFUNCTIONAL, and very different looking from the originals (not even showed the Pampers logo). If it wouldn't be from Amazon, I would say it is counterfeit... If the next time I get the same nonfunctional recharges box then I will unsubscribe this item."
86547,1,"My first Dex wipe warmer, I bought at a garage sale with no instruction booklet. I did not know that you are supposed to add 1/2 cup of water with the wipes into the warmer. However, I never had brown wipes and when I filled the warmer full the last few were a little on the dry side. My first child got older and broke the lid off, so for my second child I had to buy a new one and I figured that all wipe warmers are the same. Not true; the one I bought turned the wipes brown and dried out all the wipes. I have since purchased a new Dex wipe warmer and I add the 1/2 cup of water with a full pack of wipes and I never have had problem with dry, brown, or cold wipes again. I will never try another brand of wipe warmer again."
48387,0,"I have had pretty good luck with this monitor. I get good reception and get a good picture (color in bright light situations and good night vision). However, I did have a bad cord initially, which I paid $10 to replace. After that the battery stopped holding a charge, which was another $10. They say it would have been covered under the warranty if I had kept the receipt. I'm hoping this is the end of my problems, because I could have loved this thing if all had worked well."
88317,1,"This bag does not look like a diaper bag so I will be able to use it long after the baby gets bigger. It is not huge (which I like) and holds enough items for a day trip. It has a side pocket for a bottle and the other pocket I use for pacifiers. The two zipped pockets on each top side are great for keys, cellphone, wallet, etc because they are not very deep so you are not searching for your items at the bottom of the bag.The outer two pockets are great for toys or bibs. The inside has some pockets that I use for diapers. It is large enough to hold a blankie, change of clothes, wipes, diapers & 2-3 bottles. The strap is adjustable in length and it converts so you can hang it on the stroller handle(s). It comes with a changing pad.I love the cord material and the color is also my favorite. If you don't care for the cord material, you can get one made from canvas at Target for $30 in either black, red or camo. I have the black one and love it as well. It is called Spark instead of Skip Hop but is made by the same company and both look very similar."
74149,0,"After reading and searching through a gazillion reviews and comparing hundreds of other strollers, I bought this stroller for my two boys- 2yo and NB- And I returned it. Yes, it was cute, yes it was compact, yes it had ample storage, folded down nicely, turned/maneuvered easily, BUT it was heavy, the seat in back was not stable or comfy or roomy, the front seat didn't recline very far, the canopy didnt allow to see the child in the front, and there wasn't an available place to put a water bottle while pushing the stroller. With having said all that, this stroller is still GREAT, but for kids that are well- older. Oh, and my kids are nappers. This stroller is not nap friendly."
155976,1,"My little guy loved this from the start. This is a versatile toy that lasted many months. The mat is machine washable, so it became our take along for travel. The hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere, such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows. He's now 2 yrs, and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room! This was a great investment."
26756,1,Our son began noticing the elephants floating above the changing table immediately when brought home from the hospital. He's now 12 weeks old and he still loves those elephants! They gently float and turn in the air. The modern style and primary colors make it visually pleasing as well. LOVE this mobile!
163394,0,"I have ordered MANY items from Amazon.com and this is the first time I received something clearly ""used"" before, when I had ordered ""new"". Because of the hassle, I decided to keep the high chair and wash it myself, but I am very surprised and disappointed that this would be mailed out in the condition it was in."
34875,0,"Do NOT buy if you need a rear-facing car seat!! I did alot of research on the different car seats before choosing this one. This is a great seat with all the features anyone could want. I also heard lots of praises about this seat from friends and co-workers. We installed it rear-facing in the center of our 2002 Explorer. It was very wide and didn't fit between the seat belt buckles. We noticed it was blocking the seat belt buckle on the passenger side and our 7 year-old would not be able to buckle-up. We then moved it to sit directly behind the driver. The seat was only reclined one notch, but still the driver's seat had to be moved forward. (This posed a problem since my husband and I are both long-legged.) The seat fit great behind the driver forward facing, but we weren't ready to sit our six month-old facing forward, so this seat was returned. Why this is made so large, I don't know. But, I would definately suggest having a van or a full-size SUV like a Suburban if you want it to fit in your vehicle rear-facing. I am still in search of a seat."
114068,1,"Get this, and forget a high chair. There is nothing better about a single-purpose high chair.It's great in the house, but it's also very portable, quick and easy, so we take it with us wherever we go. It's much better than restaurants' high-chairs, which don't have a built in tray in front of the baby, and become a messy nightmare. Good from first feedings onwards. We're only at 12 months, so I'm not sure when he'll grow out of it and what comes next, but I expect without the tray it will make a fine booster when he's ready to eat at the table.Tip: use the back strap as a shoulder strap for carrying."
8107,0,"I've bought graco for everthything with both children i've owned this product for 4 weeks and it is already broken. i have an 8 week old and a 2 year old, so i needed the back that holds the car seat. the piece that holds the car seat has snapped off so now i can't even use it. It is very heavy, and hard to steer. plus the red snap thing that holds it shut when it folds down doesn't stay on either. not worth the money."
180383,0,"I bought this bag after reading so many great reviews. It is a quality bag and hooks up great to our chicco stroller. My reason for writing this review is to let people know that it is not very big. It looks deceiving. Of course you could read the dimensions but it is hard to picture sometimes without just seeing it. My daughter was born 14 weeks early and so we have many doctor appts. We live 3 hours from the hospital and have to pack for an 8 hour day. I take 2 changes of clothes, three bottles, formula (just enough for 3 bottles), 3 bibs, 2 burp cloths, 5 diapers and small travel pack of wipes and it barely fits. I know it seems like a lot but it compacts down pretty easily. It has a lot of great pockets on the outside but when you put stuff in them it bulks up and takes up the room on the inside. The pockets are great for seperating your stuff but not for extra space. It is a great bag for both mom and dad and good for going to a friends house for a couple hours but i just can't see doing much more than that with this bag. Sad because it is a quality made bag. It just isn't efficient with its space."
116871,1,When my daughter was 2 years old I got her first Dobbi. She never had any interest in blankets and had not really formed a big attachment to anything else. But Dobbi was it. She loves that his ears rattle. His long arms/paws are great to wipe away tears and she strokes her face and neck with his paws when she is upset. Dobbi goes everywhere and we've had many close calls. So I got two. She is now almost 4 and last weekend her favorite blew away in a high wind and we could not find him (at a stadium). So we just ordered our third. I hope it works.Dobbi has held up pretty well considering his heavy use. We've sewn up spots on his neck a couple times but overall he is pretty tough. He also washes very well. And unlike a blanket he can adopt an entire personality and join in all the imaginary play.
90643,1,"These diapers work really well for us, and my son has had no reaction to Dry Max, and he has pretty sensitive skin. You can't beat this price!"
182998,1,"I bought this basket so that the lids from our little Take and Toss containers would not get flipped all over the dishwasher. The lid is secure, and all of the lids get washed well. We also put the tops of kid cups, bottle nipples, and bottle rings in it and everything gets clean. It fits perfectly in the top rack of our dishwasher. I'm happy with the product."
173989,1,"This swing is way better than the others I've seen. Better for a newborn, more to occupy the baby once he's noticing stuff. It's the only place I can put my baby and know he definitely will not cry, so that I can put a load of laundry in, take dinner out of the oven, or one of those other 2-minute tasks that you really need both hands for!"
15034,2,"Wanted to use the Avent line, but baby just wouldn't take this nipple. Went with Playtex ventaire natural instead. Looks like a science lab...but baby switches easily from breast to bottle."
48818,1,See my review of the extension set.Six panels is enough for the child alone but if you want to climb in to play with them I would definitely suggest the larger 8 panel set. Great idea.
122646,1,I bought this for our handicapped son. I wanted to hear him if he needed me during the night. It has worked great. I've had no problems at all. I'm very pleased with it.
164407,2,"I decided to try the Pampers Dry instead of our usual Pampers Swaddlers in hopes of keeping my son more comfortable overnight, because he sleeps 8-10 hours. Huge mistake! These diapers made him more uncomfortable. He has huge sores on his bottom from these diapers. The sores developed in a little more that 24 hours of use. It started as redness and then turned into sores. At 6 months old, he has never had an issue with redness or even had diaper rash. I feel so bad for switching. Beware."
82338,2,"I am so disappointed with this product! It is definitely better than the boppy though. It angled my daughter perfectly, it is a great idea but the quality was so cheap by the second day it had completely fallen apart. The zipper was ""zipped"" but yet was coming open in the middle and when I went to exchange it they told me they couldn't accept it because it had breast milk stains on it. Luckily I learned how to nurse without it, but I'll never see that money again. I wouldn't buy it, it's only something you'd need in the very beginning and then it would just collect dust anyway..."
88227,1,"My husband wanted something we could both use with comfort for carrying the odds and ends of our precious little one to be. We both love the durability, the stylish and sporty look. We both felt it was a little short on space, it looked bigger than it really was. Overall a great bag, but a little bit too small."
123666,1,"i run an in home daycare.....i have several of the traditional pac n play playpens ..however they do not allow the room to ""play"" as these do....... great for confining a toddler but still allowing them room for freedom to move around and have toys .. they are confined but don't feel ""trapped"".. very easy to set up and take down !!! .. this is one of the best investments !!! .. A+ in my book"
73210,0,"Like many others have stated previously, this bottle is only leak proof to an extent. I like to pack my daughters lunch with milk, and I thought this would be the perfect way to safely do so without buying all those disposable (and expensive) products. While this bottle does keep her milk nice and cool all through the school day (especially if I put it in the freezer prior to putting her milk in), there have been numerous times that her lunch bag has come home dripping milk, and even in using it at home this has been a problem. I'm not sure if it's wear on the straw or what, but like others mentioned, if you tighten the lid as tight as it needs to be in order not to leak, the triangular section of straw that fits into the inside of the lid will twist to the side and leave a gap from which leaks spring! Also, like others have mentioned, pressure will build up internally at times, and liquid will spray out the straw when the lid is popped open- and I NEVER put carbonated drinks in here, this is just using milk! I have bought two of these (not from this supplier) and I will say that I never had this problem with my original pink/purple stainless one, but my daughter did drop that one and it no longer has a lid...so who can say?! My decorative Barbie one that I bought for her lunches is the culprit for all our leaks...dunno if it is specific to only certain designs or not. Also, the plastic ""foot"" on the bottom seems to only be hot glued on, as our stainless part was accidentally placed in the dishwasher top rack and the heat from the dry cycle melted the glue and the bottom came off. I gave this three stars because I do like the insulating properties and how well it keeps milk cold through the day."
119707,2,"We bought this monitor before we read the reviews, because of the neat features. The hand reciever makes a horrible ticking noise when plugged in and you cannot hear a voice speaking loudly into the mcirophone on the base. Even with batteries in the reciever it makes a buzzing noise and you still cannot hear a thing coming through the mic. We were very disappointed, and are returning it to the store."
20659,1,"My eight month old daughter loves this jumper! She laughs and gets such a kick out of being able to jump without being held. She takes better and longer naps after she plays with her Jumperoo. I wish I would have bought this months ago! I just wish Fisher Price had an Ocean Wonders Jumper, so all of her goodies matched!"
28291,2,"We have had this chair for almost 2 years now. It was fine for the first year but now it is falling apart. I wish I had paid the extra money for a chair that would last. The arm keeps falling off, the bottom squeaks and creaks loudly when barely rocking, and the cushon has gotten really thin. We do not even use the chair that often. I wouldn't recommend this chair unless you only intend to use it for short time."
92968,0,I thought this product would be just perfect. I have a home daycare and purchased this item so that I could easily put the cots away and still have a clutter free home. It was great for about a week. My toddler slept on this bed one time and it broke. The product is really cute though and comes with a fitted sheet. I wish it was made a little bit better.
178271,1,"I have tried a few brands of bags but Lansinoh are definitely the BEST! I am especially fond of the double zipper feature which minimizes human error in sealing the bags. I use the Playtex drop-in bottles and these bags fit very nicely inside the bottle. I just defrost, place in the bottle, and fold the top over. The nipple screws on a bit tight but it still fits perfect. I LOVE these bags!!!"
7997,0,"This cover is fine, but it is very thin. Not nearly as nice as the plush terry cover we already have."
178615,1,"We bought this when our baby was born. My husband mainly uses it, and he loves it. He takes our son to take the dogs for a walk. This is working out well for us."
57428,1,"We gave away our first portable FP swing we had for our daughter. We were in the market for a new swing with our son. We bought a version of this swing in 2006 (ours has a different print than pictured here) when our first son was born. We decided on this swing and was sure the features would come in handy. He loved it and we used it until he was about 6 months or so. I pulled it out of the garage this summer before son #2 was born to see how it was. The swing wasn't working after being in storage. I didn't want to have to buy I new swing, so I took the motor cover off, vacuumed the pieces and sprayed some WD40 on the parts, added fresh batteries, wiped it off with antibacterial wipes, washed the seat cover, and it was as good as new.I decided to write a review after I read other reviews.Here is my take on it:The toy bar is OK. It is a foam piece with 2 detachable stuffed animals. We added plastic toy links to the handles on the side and were fine with it. The baby liked to look around at the room more than the toys anyway.I really don't like music on toys. We rarely used the feature.To support our newborn, we added an insert that goes around the baby's head (like the ones in a car seat). It worked great to help support his head. We tucked a blanket in on both sides of the belt and that helped keep the baby upright too.One of the main reasons we bought the swing is because the chair comes out. I don't think the swing is hard to remove or put back. You have to pay attention to where you have the back of the swing in relation to the bar for the seat when you are placing it on the base. Other than that, it is easy. I like the bar at the bottom of the seat that comes out so you can recline the seat when it is off the base. You can carry the baby into another room and they can sit in the chair to watch you while you are doing something. It can be a rocker or a seat.The swing doesn't swing very fast and there isn't much difference between the speeds. I don't mind it and the baby doesn't seem to either.Overall, we are happy with our purchase. Our second son likes the swing just as much as the first son did!"
140228,0,"Attaches easily and provides sufficient coverage, but forget it on an even slightly windy day. The shade is so lightweight that even the wind you create jogging folds it backwards, rendering it useless. But for walking in calm conditions its a good product, really helps beat the sun."
16864,0,"I needed two sides, not just one, on a twin bed. While the actual height and length of the sides were perfect for my needs, the straps and holding ""hooks"" were overlapping when both sides were on the bed. Consequently, the middle of the bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable. I removed the straps and the ""hook"" and laid one length of under-the-mattress frame on top of the other and then using plastic ties I tied them together so that they didn't migrate.The midsection of the bed was still somewhat lumpy but the mattress was thick enough to keep it from being too comfortable for a child.Maker should consider a unit that is adaptable to use on both sides of a twin bed, i.e., adjustable under-the-mattress frame that goes only half way across the bed on each side and can then be tied or strapped together to give the whole resulting unit strength and stability."
98224,0,"I'm surprised by many of the poor reviews. I installed the gate myself with little problem. Yes, the push buttons under the mesh were a little tough, but I used the tool they gave to push the button down. I would have given it 4 stars, but when opening the gate the button is a little difficult to push down. I think w/ a little use, I will have it down pat. The bottom line is that this gate is secure - I have pushed it, tugged it, etc. It doesn't budge. If you are looking for a swing gate that does not require mounting hardware, this is the gate for you!"
127333,1,"My mom bought me this crib (from Amazon) as a gift for her new grandson. It is very nice, really good quality. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the instructions were not the easiest to understand, but other than that, I have no complaints."
95635,1,This toy hammock has been a lifesaver. My 2 1/2 year old has so many stuffed animals and I was having trouble keeping them organized and not all over his room. The hammock was easy to install and holds a lot of weight. It is very stretchy and can hold larger toys with no problem. The price was very reasonable for such a high quality item.
94398,1,"This set is much better than Avent's last &quot;Newborn Starter Set&quot;. The old set had 1 pacifier, 2 4oz bottles, 2 9oz bottles, 4 newborn (number 1) nipples and 1 bottle brush.This set has 2 newborn pacifiers, 2 4oz bottles, 3 9oz bottles, 5 newborn (number 1) nipples, and 1 bottle brush. This set is great when you couple it with the Avent Infant Feeding Set (4 9oz bottles, 1 pacifier, 4 travel nipple bases, 4 sealing disks, and 4 slow flow (number 2) nipples.Avent is really improving the products they offer."
72915,1,"This has been the perfect thing for our family and 9 month old. It is absolutely all that we need at this point, especially for the price. And, I love how it attaches to the regular chairs, so she can eat at the table with us each night."
131522,1,I bought this potty seat for my 3 year old and it works great. I have had no problems using it at any public restroom and we go out a lot. This seat fits on any oblong toliet seat with no problem. It has rubber stobbers on the front to help it from moving and the seat doesn't pinch. I would absolutely recommend this seat to anyone who wants potty training to be made easier when you go out. Children are scared of the big potty's because they are afraid they will fall in and this takes away all fear. The handles are also great because the child will not have to touch the seat with their fingers and get all nasty. I also took one of the reviews advice and I put down a seat liner before I put the potty seat down to save cleaning time. This is a great product!!
108936,0,"This mattress came free with crib purchase for me, or I would never have bought it. super light weight and flimsy feeling. Baby hasn't arrived yet - will see how it goes once she has, but may be replacing this mattress it just seems too flimsy to me."
170731,2,"I had two of these sheets for my first child because that's all I could find at the time. Other reviewers are right on about the quality. VERY thin and not very soft either. You can see the pattern right through them.Now that we're expecting our second child any day and she'll be sleeping in the play yard for a long bit, I wanted to see what else was out there.I found the following brands at BRU, bought one of each and tried them on the bed. Here's what I found:Nojo: Terrycloth-like fabric. Soft but still a bit thin. They are elasticized though, which is easier to put on and stays on better. There were three colors available at the store (dark blue, light blue, white). Price $9.99Graco quilted sheet: Very plush, though the fabric is synthetic feeling (I didn't check, but I'd guess poly blend). Most comfortable of any that I tried. Will probably use it under a more natural feeling sheet. Elasticized and stayed on well. Was only available in a dark blue. Most expensive at $14.99Carter portable crib sheet: Knit fabric. On the thin side, but soft. Stayed on well, was elasticized and came in at least 4 colors (green, white, blue, yellow). Price $7.99Koala portable crib sheet: Listed thread count of 220 and it felt like a very decent quality. Elasticized, available in a variety of colors (pink, white, blue, green, etc) and one of the cheaper ones out there at $6.99Overall, I was VERY pleased with the options out there. Highly suggest NOT buying these, but going with an elasticized sheet. Both the Carters and Koala sheets are cheaper and are better quality.The Pack 'n Play fitted sheets will only be used as under sheets from now on!"
137883,0,I bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. They love them! The light work great but the music setting is VERY LOUD! We can hear it downstairs clearly- our bedrooms are upstairs.As far as I know there's no way to adjust the volume.
113184,1,"I had to go through all the sizes before I realized I needed the 30mm. Even then, I think I could go bigger. Didn't realize I had big nipples. :) I would say to start with the larger size and go down, but then I could be wrong. I've been using the other sizes as funnels for cooking. Works great!"
28635,1,"I purchased this Glider and Ottoman for my significant other and our new baby girl, knowing that it would most likely get a good amount of use for those late night, very early morning feedings which always seem to hit around 3 AM in the morning. The product arrived in good shape and better then expected quality for the price that was paid. Very pleased with the product and it is comfortable to sit and rock away. My only disappointment was Amazon.com's miss on delivery promise. A call to customer services resolved the issue."
27047,1,"I was having lots of lower back and ligament pain as my bump grew from 30 weeks onwards. I bought this at 34 weeks and now I don't go anywhere without it. Not very comfortable when sitting down, but I didn't buy it for that. I used be in lots of pain after walking for maybe half a mile, it reduced considerably with the belt. Highly recommend it. You might want to buy one size up as mentioned in other reviews. The chart recommended small for me but I bought the medium and its perfect."
164161,1,"I must admit that I didn't use this too much because I had so many things after my daughter was born. What it was nice for was the stroller or car seat when she napped . . . instead of rolling up blankets and such. Apparently, and a fireman told me this, you're not supposed to have anything situated between your baby and the car seat because it voids the warranty on the car seat if you get in a crash . . . something like that.I also liked to use this when I put her on the floor for diaper changes so her little head would be more comfy. Obviously, the biggest benefit from using this, for most people, is to prevent flattening of the head. I will say that I've heard, personally, many success stories in using this to prevent or even correct that problem. So, for that, if your kid is especially prone to it, I'd say it's a good buy. Just don't use it in the crib . . . but you already knew that."
48112,1,"I purchased this product because I had a crib that converted to a toddler bed, but it didn't come with any kind of railing to keep my little guy from falling out. Since the toddler bed uses the crib mattress, I was a little concerned about the large size of the bolster--it covers the entire length of the mattress--but my son figured out how to climb right over it to get into and out of bed. It does pop off the mattress sometimes when he is getting in or out, but it isn't too difficult to strap it back on when I tuck him in. I couldn't find any other kind of railing that fit my son's bed, so the BedBugz saved me from just having to pile pillows on the floor next to the bed."
180071,1,"I received this as a gift for my first child. I had never breastfed or pumped before. Lots of women thought I was nuts for wanting a manual pump, but I didn't see the need to spend the money on an electric pump if I wasn't going to need it that often.It doesn't feel any different that an electric pump. It's comfortable and easy to use. It pumps as quickly or slowly as you like because you control it.It's fantastic for road trips! My milk supply decreases when we travel because I can't nurse as often being in the car. This can be used discretely, in the car, under a nursing cover.If you only plan to pump a couple times a week or just need to pump to relieve engorement, this is the perfect breast pump."
3086,1,"Love this swaddler! It's our last resort to get our infant to sleep (and almost always works!) Our baby is very wiggly and will squirm out of the snuggest blanket swaddle, but with this product they're secured with velcro. Overall very good product, not too heavy and very convenient. Wish it would've fit my baby for a bit longer - she is now seven weeks and almost has grown out of it."
183502,1,"After 5 months it has held up very well, and there is room for everything. It's also masculine enough for my DH to carry."
124401,1,"My daughter is very curious these days and I really wanted to avoid toys and wads TP in the toilet, plus, I'd like to keep her little hands away. It's easy to install if you look at the directions. Extremely easy to use (for an adult) once you've done it once. If you place it on the rim where the instructions suggest, it doesn't get in the way and doesn't damage the lid. It's also easy to remove while cleaning. It's really worth it."
68316,0,These are ok. I have found that the silicone components dont last or hold up well (less than 3months).The cups function well and hold up otherwise perfectly well. My recommendation would be to either buy in bulk or purchase with a supply of replacement 'nipples'. Best for 1-2yr.olds.
17459,0,"I have had this product for approximately 18 months. I really enjoy having it, but mothers beware. When it says not to leave a child unattended in it take it seriously. I haven't ever left mine unattended for any reason. From hands on experience and watching how the baby moves I have used extreme caution. My little girl at 2 months would slide down into the inside and get upset. We always had to keep a blanket underneath her bottom to keep her from sliding down in there. This seems like it could be a major hazard if left unattended for any length of time. I would be afraid of the baby either suffocating or breaking a bone if not watched correctly. I'm just giving a heads up on this. I have never experienced anything sreious, but just want everyone that hasn't purchased it to beware. Things like this could happen if a person isn't careful. My little girl is 20 months old and still loves it, but she is only 20 lbs. so she still fits in it. I have brought it back out for my new little one to use and he loves looking at the colors and toys. My favorite thing about this is that you can take it about anywhere you want as long as you have an air pump. The cover is washable and it stores easily too. Don't be afraid it was a good investment. Just please be a responsible parent and take precautions."
77266,2,"Got this swing months before my son was born. Everything worked great at first and the lights were adorable. Has many options for swing speeds, options of having music off or music on with lights or not at all. The swing adjustment is great, my son preferred the side to side swinging. My son loved it and put him right to sleep in the side to side position My baby used it a total of 5 times, FIVE TIMES. And now the only thing that works is the swinging motion. The lights nor the music no the mobile will turn on! I noticed the music and lights lagged to turn on, but it finally gave out. and it only took 5 times. I will be calling to see if its recalled or they have a replacement part they could send me. HUGELY disappointing!!"
157760,1,"Due to a severe choking incident while my daughter was on her back (she almost choked on her own spit up...we were lucky to be awake, didn't hear her making sounds, and found her choking and unable to breathe), my daughter now sleeps on her tummy. I wouldn't let be on her tummy for a second without this monitor, though. I love it...I use it with the Summer video monitor. I keep the video monitor on my bedside table with the sound monitor from the Angelcare next to it (the video monitor doesn't pick up sound well).We have had false alarms...maybe a total of ten times in three months. Here is my advice. Set the setting to 2; you should expect to have a false alarm, especially if the baby scoots to the edge or corner of the crib. If no false alarm, keep it at 2. If you have a false alarm, set it a little higher, like 2 1/2. If another false alarm, try 3. I do this once a month because as she gets bigger, the monitor is able to pick up her breathing movements easier. If the setting is too high, it can actually pick up movements from air vents, fans, the dishwasher, etc.The other great thing is that when the false alarms happen, the alarm wakes her up just enough to get her to shift and move, which then turns the alarm off but a red blinking light will show you that it went off."
114603,1,"Don't mess with enormous, bulky high chairs - this little guy is all you need. Some reasons why I love it:a) Great for our small space. No huge high chair taking up the entire dining area.b) Completely portable. I have even put it in my suitcase to take on plane trips.c) Easy to clean. Take off the tray, spray it in the sink, maybe give it a little scrub if necessary. Usually I just wipe down the seat part, but occasionally stick the whole thing in the sink and hose it down with hot water (particularly when the buckles get grubby)d) Booster height is adjustable for various seating scenarios.e) No silly cartoons or dumb characters/logos on it. I hate that. Plus the red/white one we have is gender neutral.Not long ago I went to someone's house for a birthday party and they rolled out this gigantic high chair (on wheels!) into the living room -- it was like a throne, and took up a huge footprint in the room, not to mention the fact that they likely spent a couple hundred bucks it. I thought it was kindof ridiculous and was very glad I'd bought this petite, unassuming little chair for under $30."
61862,0,"We have purchased both Easy Ups and Pull Ups for our 3-year-old son. He is a reluctant potty user, so we've used plenty. I have to say that I prefer the Huggies Brand Pull Ups because of their easy open sides (which are resealable if he is still dry!) and because they do not leave linty bits on my son's skin."
66043,1,"My newborn can eat more with these bottles, without spitting and with far fewer burps. A must have!"
146026,2,"This item never arrived. I have been trying to get a refund for it with no luck. The tracking info on the item has not moved in two weeks, meaning the item never left the warehouse and was never en route to me. But I am still being charged for it. Be careful as the supplier is not competent. I order a lot from amazon and have never had so much problems with an item."
47931,1,"This gate came out of the box ready to use as a pressure mount gate. It was super easy to install as a swing gate. Nice to look at and sturdy. Smooth swing action. What else can I say, we bought another!"
182084,1,I purchased this spoon for my baby as a gift and also as a feeding spoon become it silver has ability to kill germs. My baby loves it and wants to eat only from this spoon. Very good quality!!!
151555,0,"The shades do a good job of helping keep my car's internal temperature down while it's parked, but I STRONGLY suggest you remove them before driving. The white color makes them difficult to see through. Another option is that, if you're using them for the front-side windows, undo the lower suction cup & roll the windows down so you can see out."
10180,1,"after my son tumbled off the potty with the old seat we purchased this adjustable one. It's terrific, doesn't budge and has a little guard that works ok. Perfect, highly recommend."
63763,1,We suffered through using a wooden eddie bauer high chair with our son. We have small children and had to place a folded bath towel under and beside him to get him to stay not to mention the odd 3 pt belt. He transitioned to a chair booster quickly after his first birthday.We were given this in the Graco high chair in the emelia pattern for our daughter and love it. It has a 5 pt harness that was very helpful when feeding and even our tiny daughter fit well without any extra propping. At 28 months she still enjoys sitting in it without the tray and being pushed up and right under the table.We love that the tray that can go in the dishwasher and the ability to fold this chair! Although the leg span is more than on the wooden eddie bauer chair so it took up a little more room.
112359,2,My son is 13 months old and I bought a pack of these because I had a coupon. Bad Idea! My son usually wears Luvs. I've never had a problem with Luvs. The first night i let my son sleep in Pampers there was pee everywhere. I will Never buy them again. Luvs for life!
15967,1,"I bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all. I love the color, the material is easy to wash, and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable. I have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly. My only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months. The bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving. Other than that, what you see is what you get! Worth every penny!!!!"
182805,2,"I purchased this convertible car seat to replace one that reclines while rear or forward facing. The seat has a ""recline"" lever, but it is only one position and is required for rear-facing and must not be used for forward facing. In other words, this product doesn't recline in any position, it simply has two positions, and the rear-facing position is more reclined. The ""adjustable pillow"" simply has velcro on in and the velcro doesn't stick unless the pillow is in the top position, which according to the manual, shouldn't be used for the pillow."
17843,1,"For our baby shower we registered for one of those wind up mobiles. They are horrible. It didnt play music very long and who wants to keep turning that tiny knob over and over? Then a family friend gave us this and it is amazing. Since birth our son has LOVED it. It was always talking to it in the morning and during nap time before falling asleep. ""agoo-agoo"" as the butterfly and snail twirled around... so adorable. The little animals are very cute and the music is really nice. So much better than the other contraptions we have, like the swing. It has some classical songs, baby type songs and the nature sounds. He is now 8 months old and he still really enjoys it. We mainly use the nature setting now before naps to create ""white noise"". We definitely give it an A+! It will be fun to see what the next baby thinks of it."
61598,1,"I just wanted a basic baby monitor so I'd know when my son was crying, since I often can't hear him downstairs when the dishwasher and/or the washing machine are going. This fits the bill perfectly. It's extremely easy to use. Plug in the ""sound-in"" unit (mine is on the floor right next to the crib) and turn it on to a channel. Then go elsewhere and plug in the ""sound out"" wherever you want to be, and turn it to the same channel, and you're good to go. You can put batteries in these if you'd like, and the ""sound-out"" unit has a belt clip so you could wear it if you wanted to. The sound quality is good enough that I have no trouble hearing the difference between ""making noise but not really waking up"" and ""starting to wake up now."" The most important noise, ""I'm hungry - feed me!"" comes across extremely loud and clear.These units are rather light, which makes me wonder at their long-term durability. However at this price, one really can't complain. I'll update this if mine conks out as some other people's units have done."
165770,1,I got these diapers because I know the pampers brand is good and they were a very good price on Amazon. They have never failed me yet! They are soft also as some cheaper diapers are hard to the touch.
88762,1,"I bought these specifically because I missed using pampers after they introduced the Dry Max Technology into their cruisers. I thought I would try the baby dry on my son since it says nothing about dry max on the box. It also says overnight on the package, so I thought it would be a little more absorbent. I have been very satisfied with this diaper and do expect to buy more after this huge box is gone."
137865,1,"My daughter is 4 years old and I bought the pink ladybug for her birthday. She loves her ladybug. And sleeps with it every single night. She watched me order it online (most reasonable price and better selection) and this child asked me each morning when she opened her eyes if her ladybug was here yet.That said..Ours has 3 color lights. Red, green and bluish purple. It has a 45 minute auto off switch (internal). I do wish there was an option to allow the colors to automatically alternate. That is just a personal preference. Also something to keep in mind, the more round the shell, the more scattered the stars. We like seeing them on the walls AND ceiling.All in all this is a 10 star toy for kids from ages 0-10. Fabulous newborn night light too. Great baby shower gift."
133487,1,"My daughter had jaundice when she was born, so our ped recommended supplementing...so we did, using these bottles and we haven't looked back. She's primarily on formula now and hasn't had an issue going from breast to bottle and back (maybe it's just her! - lucky me). I recently had an issue with the nipples collapsing, but just figured she was ready for the next size nipple, we tried size 2 and it worked like a charm. Since day one, she's never spit up much and has one good burp after eating and is happy right away. So, I love these bottles, yes they are on the expensive side, but they're easy to clean and since my daughter loves them, I do too :)"
94023,1,Love It. It Filled in the extra wall space in my daughter's room perfectly. I even had some left over for her walk-in closet. Love that it can be removed so easily with no residue on the walls. I have flat walls - don't think it would look as good on textured walls.
94433,2,"While I'm a stubborn Anglophile, I'm very disappointed by Avent's products. The bottles are not comfortable for people with small hands (or stubby fingers) to hold, and the worst part is with the nipples, which are made of semi-hard plastic and too large for young babies. I think Dr. Brown's or the Playtex Ventaire is way better. Even Gerber's one-use disposable nipples are way better."
127549,1,"This is such a beautiful crib except that you can scratch it easily with your nail. I am not kidding. I managed to scratch it with my own, short natural nail.Other than that, it's a 10!"
167870,2,"The cool alert is not good!!!!.... it caused red itchy bumps in my daughter's diaper area. I thought it was a diaper rash, so I used desitin which helped with the discomfort, but after a week & a doctor's visit I realized that the only new thing that was changed with her pull ups was the cool alert. My two year old was soo uncomfortable that she refused to put on the pullup. We continued to use the oringinal."
99231,1,"Love the pampers. Great price, and super abosrbent! Just need to work on potty training now!"
26722,1,"I had been searching for a way to keep the fuzzies out of the living room and this gate is perfect, we have 3 and none of them have figured it out yet. I would imagine if you have a jumper they may be able to get over (if that was the case I would order the taller one), but for me works perfectly. I agree with other reviews if it is not fitting snug you are not installing correctly!! It fits perfectly in my doorway. It has been about 2 weeks and I can't say enough, very inexpensive (considering we are using a home made plexiglass barricade on the other door way, the plexiglass itself was over $30.00 and then we had to buy hardware to mount as well)!! Love love love this gate!!!"
60266,1,"I absolutely love this tub!!! We got it when my daughter was too big for the infant tub and ready for something bigger but not quite the whole bathtub. This gave us both the security of a fun safe bathtime. She is now over 3yrs old and we are just now putting it away!! It still is in the same condition as the day it arrived, and I would recommend it to anyone. We saved a lot on water as it takes less too fill up but still gives a nice deep bath if desired. I never used the plug in ours as in other reviews it was kind of impractical. I would just tilt it to dump it and prop it up in the tub against each side to drain and dry. We have an extra bathroom used mainly for her so we just left it propped in the tub when not in use, for storage otherwise it is fairly big but well worth it if you can find space. We would still be using it, but she's ready to practice swimming moves in the big tub now."
95769,1,"Good price for a cute cover for your boppy. Not quite as soft as the plush covers, but totally reasonable softness--like a crib sheet. This design is not mommy-chic but it is baby-cute."
43036,1,Definitly a must have item! Love my moby wrap! I don't know how people survive with out one! Great price and super fast shipping!!
69806,1,These diapers have really worked great for my 2nd daughter. We have never had a problem with leaks even though she is very active in rolling and jumping. I used Amazon's subscribe and save feature to have a case delivered to me once a month. It turns a good deal into a great deal.
103948,1,"I went back to work fulltime when my daughter turned 6 months old. I had been using a Medela PIS to pump one day a week and it worked fine, so I brought it to the office. I spent 30 mins pumping 3-5 oz. It was depressing because I had tons of work to do, but I had to express enough milk for my baby. I decided to try the ISIS iQ, and I love it! In 15 mins, I expressed 6 oz. The breastshields are comfortable and the pressure feature allows me to set the suction just right for both breasts. (One is easier to pump.) It doubled my output on both breasts.I am very excited about this pump. It's lightweight and portable. Since my daughter uses Avent bottles, I can prepare her bottles for day care in one step and not worry about losing a drop of milk. It was worth the money considering that hospital-grade pumps rent for $50/month plus attachments. If this pump poops out before I've weaned my next baby, I'm getting another one just like it."
143401,0,"I bought these to clean the straw in my CamelBak bottle. While they work just fine for that, I was hoping they would be a little more heavy duty. Metal is a bit flimsy and the brush could be a little larger. I am not sure they will hold up for very long but since it was a 3 pack hopefully they will last me a while. All in all, they are ""OK"""
124398,0,"This latch does work and does keep my very active son out of the toilet, but it isn't very sanitary. Since it sits on the edge of the bowl it tends to get dirty when men use the toilet. We switched it out for one that mounts on top of the lid instead."
33078,1,"These shields do work very well. I have large breasts and large nipples (E cup when I came home from the hospital) my son lacthed on great at first, but then he seemed like he couldn't handle their size and when a baby latches on wrong your nipples get even more abuse. I could not stand for a towel, or my bra to touch them, I cried every time he tried to nurse. My husband bought me these shields and an adjustable nursing bra (so I could have more room for the shields). Instead of using the inserts included I used cheap disposable nursing pads (save the nice ones for using directly on your breast). With in days I was healing and feeling sooooo much relief. But when you are nursing, take the shield off the other breast too. I wasn't thinking about let down on the side not being nursed (I had pain on my mind) and the shield filled up with milk completely. The poor nursing pad inside tried to absorb, but with the shield preesing on my breast ang having let down, it got messy. I learned quick.Overall, the shields work great. Your only choices with sore nipples like I had are these shields or go bra-less. And go bra-less and leak milk all over your house."
44507,1,LOVED THIS QUILTED SHEET ! IT'S VERY SOFT. JUST KEEP IT OUT OF THE DRYER ! I BOUGHT TWO ! FITS GRACO PACK N PLAY PERFECTLY.
29806,2,"I received this bag as a gift from my registry. I thought it would be pretty nice because it had lots of pockets. I have only been using it for 2 months now and the front pocket has already ripped at the seam. There is no way to repair it. I had small things in there (nail clippers, medicine, comb) and there is no reason for it come apart the way it did. And to top it off, the zipper is coming apart. I do not overstuff this bag and really expected a better quality than this."
73231,2,"IF I HAVE TO TRY TO CLEAN PRUNE JUICE OUT OF THE CARPET ONE MORE TIME..WHICH I WON'T BECAUSE I AM PUTTING THIS THERMOS IN THE GARBAGE. LOVED IT IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER COULD OPEN THE TOP AND USE IT HERSELF, BUT OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS IT HAS STARTED LEAKING WHEN LEFT ON ITS SIDE ON THE GROUND--AS CHILDREN TEND TO LEAVE THINGS. IF YOU TIGHTEN THE TOP TOO MUCH IT MAKES A GAP AT THE STRAW AND LEAKS FROM THERE AND IF YOU DON'T TIGHTEN IT ENOUGH IT LEAKS. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING AND AM TIRED OF FINDING IT ON ITS SIDE SOMEWHERE WITH A HUGE PUDDLE UNDERNEATH IT."
155431,0,"I bought this book thinking there would be some twin things inside the book, like sharing experiences, ect.. and there wasnt anything at all. I thought for the price, it would be better. You basicly got 2 of the same book. Would have been cheaper to buy 2 seperate book. The case it comes in is nice though."
145166,1,"We bought this for our daughter for a Christmas present, we just received it in the mail today. We put it together, then put her in it just to see how well she liked it. Well, I think she is going to be getting an early present. She loves it!! The second we sat her down in it she started going crazy. She loves all of the toys, and loves the bounce. I was really concerned with how much it would actually bounce, and it definitely went above and beyond my expectations. She is 6 months old, and my only regret is that we didn't get her one sooner. She stayed in it for about an hour and a half, then I went ahead and took her out because I figured her legs were probably getting tired. She started crying when I took her out, she wanted back in! I sat down with her in her rocking char and poor baby just fell right asleep. This is the best toy ever invented. She isn't normally very interested in toys, but loves this one. Every baby needs one of these."
54896,1,This is a great mobile that my daughter loves. She loves the bright colors and the music. Even if she is crying I can put her in her crib turn it on and she calms down right away. The negative would be that the music would be great if it could go quieter and it would be nice if it would work without music. Its rather loud. Otherwise I love it!
76718,2,"We tried to use these a few times, but now they just sit in a drawer. They're too small and don't stay on when the baby moves and kicks during a change. We have a dedicated diaper-duty washcloth for the purpose now. Cute idea but just not functional."
66137,2,"When my baby first came home from hospital I tried the Avent bottle. She was very fussy during feeding and had too much gas.I then went to the old fashioned playtex with the disposable bags. Much better peaceful feeding and less gas.I thought Dr. Brown's bottles would be even better for the gas but, when I tried it the baby was again fussing during feedings and wore half of the formula. I have to admit it did cut down on the gas but, my baby was fussing and so unhappy with this bottle that I went back to the playtex."
152769,1,"We love these boosters! It's all about the cupholders and armrests. Love that the cupholders have lots of room and they slide in when we don't need them. And, love that the armrests move up and out of the way if needed. We have 2 kids and 4 Evenflo boosters (2 for each car). We've tried the Graco ones and they went back to the store."
111161,1,loved it for my daughter when breast feeding. It was beautiful for her to use and she loved it also.
32250,2,this food mill has a blade that is too far from the grate. You waste alot of food with this mill. I have returned this product.
97783,2,"I'm surprised to read any good reviews on the VentAire bottles! I had the worst problems with these bottles. I read some of the recent reviews and I boiled the nipples and vent piece for 5 minutes and still had problems with nipples collapsing, milk not coming out and leaking! When you have a newborn baby and you're trying to feed him/her every three hours, these problems should not be occuring!! A problem with a bottle should not even exist! I never even thought to look at the reviews before I bought them because who would have thought a bottle would be a problem! My baby would get so tired from me messing with these bottles trying to get them to work that she'd fall asleep before finishing her feeding, which would then mess up her whole sleep/eating schedule. It sounds to me like it doesn't happen all the time, but who wants to even mess with it! I would recommend Dr. Brown's! I switched to Dr. Brown's and have never had a problem with the bottles or my baby having gas, etc..."
30395,2,"I think the concept is great and all, but the pad that it comes with is hard to clean (maybe I'm doing it wrong) - it's not that easy to pull off of the frame and then since there are foam beads inside, I wouldn't think that it's safe to put through the washer? Let me know if anyone's found an easier way. Also, the tub pretty big, although my big boy is actually filling it. I guess I was hoping for something that will sit on my counter. The one I had for my eldest was more simple in design but also convenient since it was smaller. The shower is a little hard to push - I mean it's not super-tough to push but when your hands are slippery and you're trying to be really careful, it takes a little bit of force to push that button. I think that once this is developed a bit better, it will eventually be a really good product. I like the idea of having more control than just pouring water over the kids' heads."
106740,1,This is one baby product that every mom must have!!! Totally perfect way of disposing diapers in the most efficient as well as cost effective manner.
64535,1,Our West Highland White Terriers stay behind this fence and the little door is handy. Our gate was broken after a couple of years of good hard use. I assume it was accidentally kicked by one of my sons our their football lineman friends. I thing it would take a serious collision to break it but it did happen. We just duck taped the gate together and we still use it but without the ability to open the door.
120882,1,"Love this gate! It swings both ways, was SUPER easy to set up. It automatically swings shut, which is great since we have to boys that aren't too careful about shutting things to keep little sister safe ;)"
29456,0,"Color didn't really match the nursery, but decent valances nonetheless. A little pricey for the quality."
151356,0,"The attachment for this mirror assumes that you have a rear headrest that raises and lowers. My car does not, so the strap was not long enough and did not attach well. I had to add elastic to the strap and velcro to hold it flush to the headrest so it didn't tip forward. Whether or not it now holds together, as other reviews suggest it may not, remains to be seen."
107620,1,This bedding is beautiful and the price was right. A bit much polyester for my taste but I basically just bought it for decoration. Very lovely!
137869,1,Haven't used it ourselves. Purchased it for a Christmas gift. My friend's grandson has the turtle and has used it for years and loves it. That is the reason we purchased this one.
123175,1,"It really is super easy to open and close.I regularly watch my 10 month old nephew (couple times a week), so I don't always have the playpen open. Every time nephew comes home... matter of 2 minutes... out of the closet, out of the bag, open... DONE.He loves it too.Very spacious and it certainly looks nice."
23898,1,"This sleepsack worked much better for our baby than the various types of swaddle blankets. It is sometimes a little harder to get her arms through the sleeve holes without waking her that it would be with a swaddle blanket, but the benefit is that it is easier to change a diaper (since it zips up the front) and the sleepsack stays in place and doesn't ride up around the baby's face. Also, the velcro pads are very large so you can adjust where to attach it on the sleepsack and make the swaddle varying degrees of tightness.My only complaint is that the microfleece is pretty heavy, so I was worried that our baby would overheat at night. Overall a great product."
4161,1,"this diaper bag looks like a hip messenger bag, but indeed fits all the things you and baby need when out on the town! guys dont feel weird to hold it cause its not girly or bulky. and moms love all the compartments and the chic look. and after the baby days, you can really use it as a book bag or for your laptop! well made, good quality."
163075,0,"I actually ordered the Safety First Diaper Pail (not the simple step). When I first received it, I was surprised by the size. It wasn't until I got the liner I ordered (which is about 2x the size of the pail) that I realized that it was the wrong pail. I need this for cloth diapering...I find it hard to believe that this will hold 2 days worth of diapers, covers, wipes, liners, doublers, etc., so I'm going to send it back for the larger pail I originally ordered. So I can't speak to the smell of it, but it is pretty small. My dog will be able to get it knocked over (and dirty diapers all over the floor) in no time."
105383,1,"We have two diaper Champs--One in the babies room and one downstairs. I must also add that we have twin daughters, so we have ""double the diapers"". We have been extremely happy with the diaper Champ. It is very easy to change the bag. Open the canister, pull out the old bag, and replace with a new bag. An added plus is that it takes normal trash bags so you don't have to run all over town to buy a ""special"" bag. I change the bags twice a week (On Mondays and Thursdays) and this works great---and keep in mind that this is for two babies! There is not a problem with any odors. I spray some Lysol in the canister at the time of bag changes and this is not really needed--I just do it. We are very happy with this product!!"
122928,1,"This product already has a loyal cult following, so not sure my two cents will make a difference, but WOW. Our wiggle-worm would ""Houdini"" his way out of our tightest swaddles with regular blankets, and wake himself up with his flailing arms. We ordered this when he was about 2 months old, and the first night we used the miracle blanket was the first night he slept through the night. That's pretty much all you need to know... LOL. I've already ordered one for my pregnant friend! :)"
143915,1,Great product! It really proctects the back of the seat. It fits perfectly. I would recommend it to all my friends.
27701,1,"I just received my stroller 2 days ago and am more pleased then not with the stroller. I read all of the reviews before purchasing and was a little concerned with 2 of the components (sun visor and child seat backs) but after owning 2 different double strollers (tandem and expedition jogger) my MAIN concern was needing a jogger (because I actually jog- not walk) that would be easy to push, light weight and have a great swivel tire. And to my surprise this stroller is by far one of the higher end joggers that allows you to jog easily without any strain. Because I read the reviews I wasn't shocked that the sun shade/visor isn't adequate so I already ordered a kiopotamous attachment. I would have given it 5 stars if they visor would have been better made. I also am not totally impressed with the way the seats move back and forth but my kids dont seem to mind it (2 1/2 and 8 mnth) and I'm sure I will get use to those in time. Also, it was super easy to put together. If you are looking for a jogger in this price range that actually allows you to jog and is easy to push then this is a good buy. They just need to re-do the kid visor."
71990,1,"My daughter LOVES this car seat.We had a Graco SnugRide when we had my first son and he loved it. My parents gave me a different SnugRide with a matching double stroller when we had my second son. He hated the car seat. He would cry from the second we put the car seat with him in it in the car to the second we took the car seat out. My M-I-L said it was because he didn't like riding backward. Sure enough when we switched him to the Britax when he was 20 lbs and a year old he was fine.My daughter used the same SnugRide as my second son for her first 4 months. She did the same thing, she cried from the second I put her in the car to the second I took her out. I mean really crying. It was awful. We drove 5 hours for a summer vacation and we couldn't take it. Not even sitting next to her distracting her helped. My M-I-L said she was the same as my second son but this time I wasn't so sure.I read all the reviews on Amazon for cheap car seats all the way to the super expensive ones. The SafeSeat had the best reviews so we went ahead and ordered it and had it shipped to our hotel 2nd day for only a few dollars extra.Well she LOVES it. She is content to ride in it and sometimes even falls asleep in it. What a huge difference. Riding in the car is pleasant for everyone now :).Maybe the second SnugRide was just uncomfortable. It didn't feel bad there was nothing poking her, but there must have been something, maybe the way she rested in it. Not sure. My poor second son.Anyway, we love this car seat. The only thing we don't really like is the plastic window in the canopy that allows you to see the baby. I get why it is there but right now it is summer and the poor sun beats down on her little head, so we just cover it with a blanket. Problem solved.So we love this car seat. It seems more roomy and we like the color. It doesn't get super hot when we leave it in the car since the padding and the straps are a silver color and not black like the last two Graco's we had. I highly recommend it."
63098,1,"Bought a few of these as replacements when the originals got wet, dirty. A must have to keep things nice and clean."
133334,0,"I switched my son from Dr. Brown's bottles to these Born Free ones, after learning about the BPA in Dr. Brown's. At first, these bottles were great! My son made a very easy transition from the Dr. Brown's to these. After about 1 1/2 months of use, my daycare provider started having problems with the nipples collapsing. I have tried everything from making sure the collar isn't too tight, to looking closely at the slit in the venting system. I can't seem to figure out what is going wrong. It doesn't happen all the time...just periodically. I emailed Born Free over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard back (not very good customer service if you ask me). Overall, I am glad I am feeding my son out of BPA free bottles, but I wish the nipples wouldn't collapse."
156580,2,The swing made my daughter sit way too upright. She just didn't like it and it seemed to go too fast.
16731,2,"The Light and Sound Galaxy Gym and Playmat is nothing special, but I guess it got the job done. For 30 dollers I wish I had gotten something else. The playmat was very thin, so when he was still really little we tried to put a blanket under it, he still got bored or uncomfortable because he started crying in about three minutes. We waited a few months to try it again and he still seemed bored with it. It would hold his attention for short periods of time, but was nothing special. We finally sold it at our garage sale for fifteen dollers, and put the money toward a walker. I would not reccomend this product."
140746,2,This product did not sem to fit in my dodge durango. There is no place for the feet to sit between the cargo area and second row of seats
149919,1,Am very impressed with this tray - the lip is large enough to stop things rolling off it and the soft material makes it a safe choice as the child wont get hurt in the event of a car accident yet it's sturdy enough to play/eat on! Brilliant product!
51082,1,"I am a stomach sleeper and with pregnancy I really needed something to make sure I stayed on my side. This pillow was recommended from a friend. It definitely helps keeping you from rolling over, but just note that it is huge. I have a king size bed, so it is fine, but i would be worried if I only have a full size bed, as it is like adding another person in the bed! the pillow cover it comes with is not the best quality, but it does the job. It definitely pills after a while and is a bit difficult to get on / off to wash. I will not be using it post delivery, but my husband has been eyeing it and wants to use it! recommend if you are a stomach sleeper who tries sleeping on your side but keeps waking up on your stomach (which is what I was doing early in my pregnancy)."
167732,1,"I bought this product six months ago, and I have NO complaints. It keeps all of my daughter's cups/bowls/lids in one organized place. I am constantly pulling things out and putting things back in place, and it has held up with no problems. I would recommend this product to everyone!!"
1542,2,"With 3 grandchildren, I've tried many disposable diapers and my daughter and I feel that Pampers does not, in our opinion, measure up to Huggies."
19814,1,"I got this to use on a double jogging stroller, and never tried to use any stick-on fasteners. I just used the tie straps & snaps and it works great. And, considering this is &lt;1/3 the price of any other shade/rain covers for double strollers, I think it's great.For shade, it's not something you necessarily want to use when the kids are alert, but I got it primarily for use during naps, so the privacy & view-blocking is perfect. You can also adjust the view by unfastening some of the snaps (unsnapped one side while one kid was awake, other asleep on the covered side). It covers down past the feet on my stroller. The mesh is great to keep bugs off, and kids can still see fine when white shades are removed. The fabric seems pretty breathable, yet kept the kids & contents dry during a light/moderate rain. Adjusting the snaps (some open, some closed) also helped with airflow. It's also much better than the clear pvc plasticy rain cover I have for my single Maclaren - the kids HATE to be shrink-wrapped like that, in a sweaty suffocating pod they're strapped into... yuck.This is not a cover for every day use. I keep it in it's self-bag in the basket of the stroller to pull out for naps or rain or extreme sun exposure or a particularly buggy day. It meets my needs perfectly for the price paid.(now, I would expect another shade that costs 4x as much to fuction 4x better, which would not be an easy task.)"
8196,2,"I bought this changing pad cover because it was really affordable. However, I did not read the description closely enough where it states 'flat changing table cover'. I have a Summer Infant changing pad that is the standard shape and size and this cover did not fit - it is way too small to cover the pad. Make sure when you purchase this you have a FLAT changing pad."
107039,1,"This product is simple and easy to setup and use. No special bags to purchase. To store diaper, you just slip the diaper in and flip the handle. No smell from within is possible.The only downside is when you pull the bag out, you have to tie it shut and can get a wiff. We change our bags twice a week (trash days). The smell is not that bad and our bags have a lovely baby powder scent so it compensates.At least we don't have to deal with diaper ""links"" or the possibility of the links unravelling. All we do is tie the bag at the top and put in a new bag."
10562,2,"Made in China crap...NOT made in the usa. Typical Gerber lies. Yes I know, got sucked into ordering and Chinese crap showed up...who knows what chemicals it's tainted with. Look someplace else if you want made in the USA and expect a quality product."
137205,1,"We had this for my son and 2 years later are passing it down to my daughter. She loves it just as much as he did. It does sit well on the tray and we have had great luck in keeping it there. The spoons are well designed so more goes into the mouth and less into the lap. The colors are great, it is dishwasher safe, and most importantly, my kids love it. The contoured sides make it easier for them to get the food on the spoon without pushing it out of the dish. I loved every Bjorn item we have and this is no exception."
28520,1,I love love love this chair! It was so easy to put together and the color matched our crib/changing table perfectly. The arms have pockets which we've put burp rags and blankets in for easy access while feeding the baby. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for glider.
106133,2,"I registered for this item because I heard good things, well it is good UNTIL your baby starts eating baby food and has more bowel movements. This pail lasted me until my baby was 5 months old, then the pail does not hold in odor. I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem. So use your judgement but be prepared to have odors once the baby starts eating baby food."
135918,1,"These are great bottles. I cannot say if my baby would have more gas without these bottle since these are the only bottles I have ever had her using, but I can tell you that she has very little gas if any.Yes these do take extra time to wash with all the parts but its well worth it. A previous reviewer mentioned that they were a pain to use on the go because they had too many parts. All you do is rinse the bottle out and wash it when you get home. No biggie. They also mentioned that they always leak. These bottles do not leak if you put them together properly which is not hard. I had them leak a couple of times but when I opened the bottle to check it out I realized I had not put the bottle together correctly. So its all about using them correctly and not blaming our mistakes on the manufacturer. You will not regret purchasing these."
16122,1,"The blanket is very useful, very easy to fold out and in. We use it at the park and at the beach: my 8 month baby likes it. Looks difficult to machine wash at home, since it is big."
24129,0,"This monitor seems to work great, except for the annoying alarm clock sound that occurs at random times of the day and night. I did contact evenflo and they offered to send me a new monitor. This is the only model with pet detection, so they are going to send the same model, but if the same issue occurs, they will replace the unit with a different model. At least they are owning up to the problem and trying to do something to replace it. Other than the random alarm, this unit works great."
148253,1,"The BabyBjorn Little Potty is perfect for my granddaughter! She loves her new pink potty! It's the perfect size for her to potty train with. My daughter can take the potty everywhere they go. It's portable & small enough to sit on the floor of their vehicle. The nice part is that it's all one piece. No parts to lose, break or forget when going bye-bye's. Oh & did I mention how easy it is to clean? No hidden nooks or crannies so the potty stays clean at all time. Now they can have a potty on all levels of their home. That's really helpful for our ""little trainee"" to help avoid accidents. The delivery was very fast, actually earlier then predicted. I highly recommend the BabyBjorn Little Potty for all in the training stages & afterwards too."
73145,1,"If you register for this item and get it, wonderful! But if you are crafty or know someone who is, there are patterns out there and you can sew one for yourself. Or, they can be bought used on Ebay!It's good to have if you go places where the shopping carts are kept outside and are cold on that little tushy. I have found that every store I go to now doesn't seem to have carts handy. Gee... How convenient. It's nice to know that he can go in the cart and I don't have to worry about him chewing on the handle of the shopping cart. However, I don't believe any claim that this will actually keep him from getting any germs."
145826,1,"Fun & stimulating for babies. This is a different setup from the original Jumperoo Fisher Price made 4 years ago, the original was lighter and easier to transfer from room to room. This one has more toys for the child -overall very appealing but bulky & space consuming."
123745,1,"We've barely had this for 2 days, but my 9 week old daughter seems to really like it. Our son, 2, didn't really care for things like this when he was a baby, so we didn't have anything really, but our daughter LOVES staring at things whirling and twirling and in this case, chirping. For this age, when they're really first starting to notice things, I think that this playmat is great. The material is very soft and smooth, and seems like it would clean up very easily. The one issue I have with this is, it is much smaller than I think it was portrayed on the packaging and in advertisements. It's about 30x30 inches, which seems like it would be plenty big, but like I said, our daughter is only 9 weeks old, and she seems to really fill it up. Also, as mentioned before, it is kind of expensive for what it does.... I only got it because Toys R Us had a special where it was $8 off.... but I'm sure we'll get our use out of it."
30906,0,"I am not sure yet, we just received the Sit N Stroll because I want to use it for a trip this week to San Diego. We will be in and out of hotels, flights and rental cars, so I want something easy. Anyway, I am not sure if I want to use it now because it didn't come with any sun shade and Babies R Us doesn't sell it online. In the summer months and in sunny destinations, I feel a sun shade is a must. So, who knows. It is very easy to convert to a stroller and is simple to manuever. We just have to see how easily it will be installed in/out of the rental car...I guess I am a bit disappointed that I can't buy a sun shade very easily, I think it should either come with or be offered by the retailer who is selling the Sit/Stroll."
165572,1,"My baby boy has used pamper after his born. I remember Amazon had pamper promotion $[...] gift with $[...] purchase, and I bought 1 box of Pamper 1-2 size for new born, and 2 boxes of Pamper size 3 cruiser. It works great and never leak. My baby grown fast and when we used of Pamper 1-2, size 3 began to be good size for him when he was 35 days.After that, per two months I could catch amazon pamper promotion. Now my baby is 1yrs 2 months old, I bought almost 15 boxes from size 3 cruiser to size 6 baby dry, or easy up.Cruiser is very good but a little bit expensive. After my baby 6 months, I bought baby dry for him, since he moved around and weather is hot, thus baby dry becomes perfect for him.My baby fewly wet bed sheet. Since whole family spoiled my baby boy- the sole grandchild in my husband's family, auntie once bought a small package of Huggies easy up for him when we used of pamper but still wait next promotion at Amzaon, I should say Huggies's easy up is horrible, something leak out from diaper, like white powder. Everytime I had to wash him.I would just keep to buy pamper easy up now and definitely would recommend pamper to new moms."
4269,0,"It is very thin and looks comfortable, but I am looking for a matress pad that is not only waterproof, but quilted on both sides. I own one but ripped the tag off so I dont know the brand. At any rate, this pad is vinyl/sweaty on the back and not what I was looking for."
101729,1,"I got this for the same reason everyone else did 2 kids in different roomS and I want to be able to hear them both. I love this Monitor its a great idea if you are lucky to not have static while you are using it. Also most of the time one of my recevers wouldent let me hear noise coming from the ""A"" monitor the only way I knew my son was making noise was the light being lit up. I have since swiched the monitor recevers cords that had helped now no problems but, still static. Whats a mom to do!!!"
76485,2,"All sleep positioners and wedges are unsafe for use with babies. The SIDS alliance specifically states to avoid using these products in order to reduce the risk of SIDS. I bought one for my unborn son and while I'm bummed to be out $20, I'm glad I learned of this before I placed my precious little boy on one of these positioners!"
52215,1,Just got three packs of these for only $10 each here at Amazon. Great deal. Much cheaper than at the supermarket. Does not leak.
164873,1,"Regardless of the cons that I will list, Pampers Baby Dry are my #1 diapers. Here are my pros and cons.Pros: keep baby's bottom dry, don't leak, don't cause rash, they're toughCons: they really sag when they get wet, they have a smell (not stinky...like chlorine or something)"
59351,1,"I love this product!!! It is one of the few things that I knew I wanted with my second child that I didn't have with the first, and I have not been disappointed. I use mine on my changing table and it keeps everything so handy in one place. It is always neat and together, and I never have to look around for what I need. My son is still in size 1 diapers so I do find that when I pull a diaper out another one might fall out. This is a minor inconvenience for the organization that it provides. The last thing you want in the middle of a diaper change is to be disorganized!"
93793,1,"While we haven't had the chance to use this for our newborn, we decided to put the up gate early to keep our 3 80lb dogs out of our dining area. The gate took about 20 minutes to install using a drill and screwdriver. It works great in the large opening between our dining room and living room. It is sturdy and contrary to previous reviews, pretty easy to latch and unlatch once you get the hang of it. Highly recommend."
178922,1,"I bought this item for my little girl's room. The fabric is really nice especially the quilt, looks like hand quilt. The bugs and butterfly are of nice color. This picture didn't do justice with this bedding. I am pleased with my buy."
176614,1,"I started using these bottles with my daughter 4 years ago and now I am using them for my son. Both of my kids loved them, never had any spit up or gas problems. Both kids were breastfed but I gave them formula once a day. They never had any problem switching from breast to bottle. I tried avent bottle with my son but he started spitting up. The only reason why I tried Avent was that my son needs more than 8OZ -:) so it is small for him! All in all very happy."
65152,1,This is my third & fourth Britax Roundabout. We bought two for our first child (one for each car) 5 years ago and needed to get new ones for our second. There was no doubt we would get another Britax.Straps are easy to use and never get tangled like the straps on other seats I've seen.A great seat.
100818,1,With amazon mom I only pay $30 for this box which lasts a month. Diaper quality is fine well worth the buy!!
33127,2,"but it doesn't work for the single deluxe medela pump which i have.i bought this adaptor so i could pump in my car on my lunch break but apparently the power is too much for the motor on the single deluxe.unfortunately, the product details do not advise that this only works on the in style pump or else i wouldn't have bought iti wish they would make one for their other pumps and i'd be glad to use it."
70619,1,"This bouncer has got to be the best gift I've recived for my daughter. The softness to it allows her to fall asleep it quicky & even when she is up in it she looks comfortable. As for the toy bar she just stares at it because she cant reach it yet. There is one thing that I don't understand about the toy bar is, why is the cows face facing the opposite way of the kids?"
146991,1,"I love this playmat. Color looks cute and you can change colors and shape due to your need.Yes, it scratches easily. However, I rather have soft material under my baby's tummy rather than concrete."
27785,1,"We have not yet been able to use this outside of the home, the true test will be to get it through public doorways! Everything is great and is a nice quality stroller."
139995,1,"I had been using an old baby gate to keep my little doggies in their part of the house. It was quite ugly and hard to step over. I have tried many, many gates and this one is the first one that I can step over easily (the ones with the open/shut latch gates never worked right for me) and looks nice...it is visible from the main part of the house after all. I think it was easy to assemble as I didn't hear any cussing from my son as he was setting it up."
5506,1,"I like the size of this garbage bag for a family car. It is larger than others I've seen, but still fits easily on the floor between the front seats without being obstructive. It's good for the trash a family accumulates daily (tissues, scraps of paper, cups, etc.). It is more than adequate for any garbage that we'd want to leave in a car."
104915,1,"I love this soap, very thick, nice peppermint smell. Well worth the price, I still have some of this soap.AAC"
68773,1,I thought I should chime in here on the pricing issue. Amazon has now added larger Value Packs where you can get still get the same price per diaper you were getting before on these smaller packs. This is the most competitive price I can find anywhere and you can get it shipped free to your door.
103270,2,Can't ship an item that has been ordered two months ago?It's not like it's rare precious jewels or something.It's diapers!!!!!
164465,1,I wear these when my mistress comes over and I dress like an infant and she paddles me for being a bad baby.Goo Goo Gaa Gaa.
48220,2,I wish another company made sheets that fit the Arm's Reach cosleeper because this sheet is not of such great quality. It's not soft even after washing. For the price they should have made a better product.
109501,1,"These feeders are a great idea and our son loves eating out of them, but I always have a hard time getting the last bits of banana out when I'm trying to clean them. Definitely a worthwhile purchase, though."
64139,1,"So far so good...nice album, lot of space available in every page along with photos, notes about the photos can be written in the space...decent album to have."
18421,0,"Although our baby feeds well from these, there are a few major downfalls:*They are too big for the average insulated travel packs, (height & width)*Second, they are awkward for most bottle drying racks-- because of their unique shape and all the little parts-- not to mention it's a pain to wash them in the first place because of all the little pieces*The nipples are slightly too tall for the caps. So when you put the cap on the nipple gets bent"
25499,0,After using this liner our son broke out in a diaper rash. We are new to cloth diapering and loving it. The functional aspect of the liner is as advertised. Kushies and Nappies work better for us. Kushies to provide a barrier between the diaper and diaper rash cream and Nappies due to their soft feel. Wish IV liners worked out for us.
112326,0,"This box is 116 cruisers for $35, but Target's big box has 160 for $42 so make sure you have the exact box you're comparing!"
142705,1,"We read a lot of the reviews for this product before buying it - some did not like the zipper quality ( 2009 covers).I have to say that I am VERY pleased with this product! The zipper quality is heavy duty. I had no problems assembling it into my stroller, I was worried about fitting it in my single jogger stroller(from baby trend) but I was pleasantly surprised! It has straps on the bottom so you can pull and adjust the fitting to your stroller. I Highly recommend it to parents! If you live in areas where snows, rains or is windy this cover is a PLUS. Bottom line, my daughter stays nice and warm inside this stroller cover. Well worth the money for us!"
132398,1,"This wipe warmer is great. Keeps the first few wipes warm enough so as not to startle the baby (especially helpful for night changings). Also has a great little night light (also helpful at night so the baby stays in &#34;sleep mode&#34;). Also, it doesn't take up too much space. I would recommend this product."
48889,1,These are GREAT for blocking/sectioning off large areas that are too awkward or tricky to really baby proof. We are military and move a lot so I don't like to invest in a million baby proofing gates that I don't know if I'll need in 6 months. This has worked out perfectly for a certain area of our house. Definitely recommend!
36040,1,"First off, this is not a cup for a parent with a child that throws cups or pulls lids off or flips cups upside down and shakes them on a regular basis. If you want one of those then you need to get a cup with a valve that's closer to a bottle. However if you need a cup that won't make a huge mess when knocked over then these are the right cups for you.These are nice cups for kids transitioning to regular cups or for older kids that are in situations where a regular cup would be inconvenient. I used these for years after my daughter had transitioned to a regular cup when we were in situations where a spilled drink would have been a disaster, such as for her cup beside her bed at night, the cup I put her juice in when she was sick and for trips in the car. They're cheap and they stack in the back of your cabinet so you can just pull them out when you need them.The cups are dishwasher safe, they do crack when chewed on but besides that they're fairly strong for something that is disposable."
149239,1,Love the pillow and I'm only in my fifth month. Have been using it for a couple of weeks now and cannot imagine sleeping without it because I was starting to get lower back aches. The hubby would also try to persuade me to turn on the other side of the pillow so he could hug one side as well. I would accommodate him occasionally but made sure he knew who's boss of the pillow. =)
153652,1,"This chair was perfect for our family! My daughter is a year old and only 17 pounds, so she barely fits in anything made for her age. When she was six months old she actually fit in this chair (but not the expensive Peg Perego one my mom bought for her house - they have to use pillows to prop my daughter up).I know other reviews have said its hard to clean, but I simply take the cover off and throw it in the washer (at least once every other day). I let it air dry and it looks perfect. Minor wiping cleans the rest.The only problem I have with the chair is that my daughter quickly figured out how to pop off the extra tray covers and flips her food onto the ground. We have to use it without the small covers now.Overall, the color is great and so is its size proportions!Would buy it again and again!"
56507,1,"Have used these since my son started to walk and after the initial interest in them (as in anything new) he was bored of them, realizing they were difficult for him to open. He occassionally spins one, but they deterred him enough that he doesn't care about the stove anymore. And they are a snap for me to open, and I have never had to pull the stove knob off--not sure what people are talking about there...."
16487,0,"I received the product on time, however, there was only one tube. I think when you purchase something, whoever packages the product should make sure the consumer is getting what they paid for."
164160,1,I want to tell you this works. It arrived promptly and the price was the best I found. I would recommend this product for anyone concerned with the flat spot on a child's head.
184885,0,"I agree with everyone else who says this chair is hard to clean. I bought the lighter colored wood chair, which really makes the grime build up noticeable, especially on the foot rest. We clean the high chair all the time, but the wood almost has an absorbency about it and there's just so much you're able to get clean. And I'm not sure why some areas that have been cleaned have a sticky feeling to them except that maybe it's a reaction of the wood to the chemicals in disinfectant wipes. It looks nice, but I wish I had gone with a plastic, easier to clean high chair."
19672,1,"We thought we didn't need one but after boiling water and dunking the bottle for what seemed like eternity, this saved our life. It is fast AND accurate."
108300,0,"I liked this burst. The figure of spiderman is great. I would like to have the spiderman sixpack lol. The figure looks great to put it on a place, just by itself. And also it is a bank. Overall I liked it a lot."
140435,1,"Ok I have mixed thoughts on this swing, but overall I think it is worth buying. I know each kid is different, and my daughter could care less about the mobile part, and she really really wants to sit up more. The music startles her a little bit but she gets used to it. I think she would rate it low from her perception and interest in toys.My 28 pound toddler son on the other hand would give it a 4.5. He loves the thing even though he would have nothing to do with a swing as an infant. He has tried pulling the animals off at first and now just give them kisses as they go by. He loves the sounds choice that makes each animal noise and he names the colors as they go around. He can get himself in and out of the swing, and uses it as a bouncer type toy as well. The swing itself wont work with him in it because he is too heavy (instructions say 25 pound max), but it gives it a good try. He has not broken it yet even with all of his rough play. He tries to swing his sister ""gentle"", but gets carried away and he has not bent the metal rods or disrupted the swing yet.I personally would only give it a 3 from what I expect. You must realize that my son gives the machine a run for its money, and my issues are not ""traditional"" issues that a parent without a toddler or a more strict parent might not have. The seat cover needs more attachment points. The feet part keeps coming off and I find myself being worried that every time the infant moves alot she might end up out of it via her butt. It also takes up a lot of room in the vehicle when we go places, but I make room so that she has a place to sleep out of the way.I love the fact that the mobile swings up and over so its completely out of the way, and that is is both electrical and batter. I once just grabbed it and put it in the car for a weekend visit and completely forgot it used a plug in until I got 300 miles away. Thats where the batteries really helped me out, but mostly I just use it plugged in. The music is not timed and will stay on until I turn it off, and even though all the 4 options are not really my type of music (jamacan?) It is much different then what is usually heard. The stem that holds the seat allows me to attach via velcro a mirror that she loves to look at herself with, and I like the fact that I can simply rotate the seat any direction with no buttons to push or no ""elbow grease."" Oh the mobile stops moving when you lift it up without having to take the time to turn it off. I use this often to keep my toddler from ripping it off when pulling on the animals, and the animals are so great and vivid that I may just keep them when my daughter is done with it.I hope this helps. I have three types of swings I used trying to get my son to like any of them, and this is the fourth type in almost three years and I like this one the most!!!"
135610,1,"We bought 2 of these for our oldest grandchildren and they work great. All in all, a good purchase."
121241,1,"I am very happy with this product. I myself own more than 10 different sunscreens for adults, both for face and body, but this baby sunscreen is by far easiest and most pleasant to apply. It's not sticky, it's very pleasant to touch, no smell, doesn't leave residue, spreads easily, not thick, it's light but moisturising at the same time, overall, a very pleasant cream. I use it myself because it feels so good."
24329,0,"You need it you need it right? But really 20$? I cant dry it in the dryer, it needs ironing to get the wrinkles out and I could have saved the money. I only really needed the one that came with the co sleeper and I use the gerber water proof pads to protect from accidents. My baby is 4 weeks but in another 8 months I may need them... I will update then... But I doubt it, lol... I am a first time Mom and a minimalist."
21875,2,Bought it because I have 3 kids and a small car (Honda Civic). Car Seat is the desireable size I needed but it doesn't hold well in the seat. The back has no support at all and if your kid moves a lot he/she will mvoe it off it's place. Only recommemd for emergency use only. I ended up buying an Expedition after 2 weeks of use.
176384,0,"This pump did it's job, but it was too loud. I used it for an entire year with my first child, but now that I am going to have a second child, I am purchasing the Madela pump in style double pump, which has excellent reviews. Thinking back on my old breast pumping days, it haunts me to think of how lound this single pump was. I can't take the noise this time. I had read the reviews before I bought this pump. Everyone said it was too loud, but I never could have imagined that it was really as loud as what people said. Well it is. Unless they have improved the model from 2002. If you value your time and hearing, then go with the dual pump that has great reviews and save your money."
135995,2,"I was looking forward to using this product along with my baby food making kit but this food processor seems to only be able to handle very small quantities of food. By small quantities I mean maybe 2-4 ounces at a time to be able to puree the food. I was quite disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it unless you plan on only making small quantities of food or food on a daily basis for your little one. Otherwise, it does it work."
48844,1,"It's great for chihuahua puppy's, they have room to play, without being underfoot. Also has room for there food, water & litter pan."
113027,1,"I was excited to see this product as I was looking for a growth chart for my son that wasn't girlie. I ordered it and it was delivered on time and in good condition. My only problem with it was that the ""sidelines"" of the chart don't line up where it is put together. The hinges are off just enough to keep the two halves from lining up."
71518,1,"It was the best buy for our baby. I'm so happy we bought it. It is lightweighted, practical and it has a magnificent design. It is very easy to handle, even grandma can fold it and has no problem using it. The accesories which come with it are so useful and well thought, e.g. the mosquito net. The only flaw I see is that you'll have to buy a car seat and the adaptors as well.Expensive, yes, it is worth every penny! Our 3 month old sure loves it and so do we!"
170945,1,"This baby monitor is easy to set up and use. The two monitors allow you to monitor the child from multiple locations without having to pull the monitors out of their handy charging cradles. The monitors also allow you to check the room temperature and/or talk to the child. The base station can also act as a very soft night light (amber color).The parent monitors incorporate a light bar and variable volumes to indicate a child that is crying. Thus, you can monitor your child with settings ranging from mute (good on conference calls) to extra loud. The base station should be installed within 3 feet of the cradle/crib/bed for optimum audio performance.The DECT technology that underlies the monitor system works flawlessly and on a relatively unused portion of the frequency spectrum (1.9GHz). Thus, it will not interfere with wireless networks and older cordless phones. Even better, DECT-based phones and the baby monitor also seem to co-exist nicely. The range of the monitors is about 100 feet indoors and about 150' outdoors.The base station runs off 4 AA batteries and the monitors run off 2AAA batteries each. The batteries for the monitors are included, but not for the base station. Do not use regular batteries in the base station or monitors (which work as a backup for power outages or while out and about), use NiMH-based AAA batteries instead. Otherwise, the charging cradles may attempt to recharge the batteries inside (with messy results). I subsequently replaced the OEM AAA batteries with higher-capacity after-market models to increase runtime.All in all, a great system, the only downside is cost. However, if you live in a urban environment with a lot of baby monitors/phones/etc. interfering with each other, this is the system to get IMO. IIRC, the only difference of this system to the -950 is that the 590 has two parent units and cannot play lullabies to the kid."
52407,1,"This has been the perfect diaper bag - so easy to wear and compartments for everything. It looks compact, but is pretty roomy. I have a 3 year old and 18 month old and carry my cell phone, wallet, plenty of snacks, sippy cup, 2 diaper and wipes everywhere we go. I haven't missed all the excess stuff I used to carry in my uncomfortable previous diaper bags. Love it."
53526,2,"After reading the mixed reviews, I decided to give this chair the benefit of the doubt and was so excited when it came today. I have a 1 year old and nanny two other babies during the day so I was desperate for something to make mealtimes a little easier. I opened the box and put the chair together only to realize that the arm pieces of my chair didn't match the pictures in the direction booklet. the lower arm that is supposed to sit under the table is welded so that it pokes up higher than the upper arm - it's impossible to use as the arm position propels the chair at a freakish angle and won't latch onto any surface. (I tried to attach some pictures to show this but it won't let me). After messing with it for an hour trying to find any way to make it work, i took it apart and packaged it back up. I'll be sending it back this afternoon. Such a disappointment. Don't waste your money."
163561,0,We've been using this high chair for about 7 months and overall it works well. It easily attached to my dining room chair and doesn't take up much space. I love the big tray and the recline feature. My biggest complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to clean. My son is a messy eater and there are tons of little nooks and crevices that food gets stuck in; it almost seems as if the designers purposefully created places for food to hide. If I had to do it again I would probably purchase something else.
80177,2,"Cute colors, and i really like the smaller avent pacifers, but these are too heavy and fall out his mouth when he is almost asleep and wake him up. I also have Mam pacifers and I'll buy those from now on. Dont waste your money. I do like the cover that comes with avent pacifers though."
128251,0,"For what you pay for this product, it's decent.What I like:(1) Great size.(2) Safety hinges really do work well.(3) For the cost, it looks good (and works in my dining room).(4) Previous reviewer is correct: the top is not solid wood (and neither are the side, front or rear panels). I think this is designed this way so that the top is lighter and the safety hinges work, but it does give you a sense that it's of lower quality. To look at it, though, you would never know this. You only realize it as you put it together.(5) Goes together pretty fast with a phillips and a flathead.(6) My nanny liked it and she's the biggest critic in our household, especially when it comes to safety.What I don't like:(1) The safety hinges attach to the rear panel, and it's flimsy. It wobbles with every opening. However, there are two hinges that hold the top to the rear corners that ease my mind on safety. I'm not worried about the top falling off or coming down hard. My 2-and-a-half-year-old had the most fun this weekend opening and closing this box and I rarely worried about his fingers. Now that he's opened it so many times successfully, I won't worry at all.(2) The die cut on the bottom was not correct, so we had to cut the bottom piece to make it fit (or send it back--what a pain).(3) The white plastic pieces that are designed to cover the tightening mechanisms don't fit. If I'm going to use them, I'm going to have to glue them."
135532,1,"Wow, I am surprised at all the negative reviews on here. All I can say is, I absolutely love this tub! We used to have a Fisher-Price tub, and it was okay, but this one is so much better for our 10-month-old. It folds and unfolds easily and saves us so much space in our small apartment. And the tub itself is comfy (cushy inflatable lining instead of hard plastic) and relatively deep, so it keeps baby warmer in the bath and is more fun to play in! All the other baby tubs are small and shallow and more quickly outgrown. I can see how this tub might not be the best for small babies, but for a baby who can sit up, it is just perfect."
89130,1,"These diapers are the best I have ever purchased. They seem to be very soft, comfortable and don't go through easily. I will definitely buy them many times again!"
92655,2,im still trying to figure out how to use this product...im keeping it because im sure someday someone will know what to do
41891,2,"I was searching everywhere for a straw bottle that did not have a valve in the straw that makes it hard for my child to suck the liquid out. And I was ecstatic when I found this bottle that has absolutely no valve at all, which is exactly what I wanted. Although it does leak a lot if turned upside down, I knew it would and it did not matter to me. However, the biggest problem with it is the material it is made of, it is not silicone plastic but is rather hard plastic, so if it falls on a hard surface like asphalt, the bottle gets damaged and will seep water. Depending on how big the damage is from the fall, the water may leak very little still rendering the bottle useful or it may leak to the point that you cannot use it at all. I have 2 bottles that have been ruined in a 3 week period. I contacted the company about this to find out why they would use this sort of plastic that is not durable at all given that it is used by children who drop bottles all the time. They said they were surprised to hear that two bottles cracked upon falling as they have never heard these kind of complaints before. I find it very hard to believe as I see a lot of reviews on this same issue. I have since purchased a silicone Green Sprouts bottle on which I will use the top from the aqua bottle (since they are supposedly interchangeable) and this way if the child drops it, it should not break, hopefully it will work once I get the silicone one."

55056,1,"I use this sling for everything. My baby loves it, she always sleeps in it. I put her in it when I go grocery shopping and it is the best. Also I know when she's in it she is comfy and she sleeps, I don't worry about her waking up and screaming.I disagree completely with the reviewer who says this is for cold weather only. I live in Florida, its 98 degrees already and muggy, and I have my daughter in this sling wearing a full body sleepy sack, and she doesn't have any problems getting too warm. It makes the baby feel close to you and gives them a sense of being in the womb. She is 7 weeks now, and still loving it."
128079,1,"These blankets are hands down the BEST baby blankets, I have 4 of them in all different colors. They are super soft and a nice big size. I give them to all my friends as baby gifts, they come in the best colors too! Thank you Swaddle Designs!"
116607,1,Excellent choice for our 2 wave runners! Application not too hard especially after watching you tube video.Great buy. Fair price.
75518,0,"Bought this dresser to go with the Stork Craft convertible crib. The crib seems to be of much better quality than the dresser. It was a bit of a pain to put together, not too difficult, just a lot of steps. Some of the wood seemed slightly warped, so it didn't fit very nicely. It's an okay dresser and I hope it lasts."
100027,0,It did it's job. The only con I saw was that it sometimes left a white residue on my daughter.
144434,1,"I run a daycare and these diaper sacks are great! Much less expensive when compared to the diaper genie type, plus there is no diaper genie to sanitize, just the trashcan which has to be sanitized any way.These are plenty big enough to fit a stinky soiled diaper, the wipes and the gloves (which who doesn't use gloves these days!).I personally do not like baby powder smell in general, the deodorizing smell is however much better than BM smell!My only suggestion in improving these would be fragrant options such as vanilla or febreeze neutral or maybe even a lysol anti-microbial type. I'd feel even better thinking any pathogens contained were being killed."
126695,1,Great price!!! Buying from Amazon is the only way to go!! I'll never buy diapers from a store again!! Huggies are the only diapers I use for my daughter!
9616,1,"We bought 2 of these potty chairs. They were so easy to clean and stayed brand new looking that I sold both of them for 75% of their original list price when we were done with them. How cool is that? They maintained their value.Note: When potty training, don't forget to buy the character underwear. We bought Elmo Underwear with the baseball cap (sport theme) from ebay and it worked great. Trained within days!!"
85895,0,This is a cute activity center that also lets baby bounce.It's construction is sturdy and very easy to assemble.The only complaints that i have is that the toy rattle easily snaps off and the toy bar is made out of a hollow plastic and easily bends.i'm afraid in time it will break off.But my daughter loves this toy she has to be in it all day everyday.
82362,2,"If you are planning on using this monitor with batteries...forget it! It zaps battery power within weeks (and I only used it during naptimes); therefore, now I can only use it when both units are plugged in, which severely limits the convenience and choice of locations throughout the house in which to use it. It also does not work when using a cordless phone (which is all I have) due to signal interference. The alarm goes off and takes forever to stop (even after the phone has been hung back up). So if you forget to turn it off before you answer the phone you'll wake the baby up anyways from the sheer noise of it. I am thouroughly disenchated with this product!"
68966,1,"These are great diapers of course, but the price (with no sales tax) plus the convenience of home delivery made these a fantastic deal. Also, I bought these when they had a special on Pampers products. If I bought more than $79 in Pampers products as one order, I would recieve a $30 gift certificate for a future Amazon purchase. That's like recieving an entire case of diapers free!!! WIth 2 little ones in diapers, we could certainly use the free diapers."
117513,1,My son is entertained and doesn't want to get out of this. It fits securely although I wish the clamps were a little longer. Great product
176275,1,"When I decided to cloth-diaper, I knew I wanted to use the same diapers my mother and grandmother used. I love them! We alternate between these, all-in-ones, and disposables when we're out, and these are just as absorbent and easy to use as the others. They're also easy to clean and cheap enough that I don't worry about ruining them."
135465,1,"If you could recharge the unit and not have to change batteries, I would have given it 5 stars. The sound is so clear that when we first started using the monitors, I would have to check if they were really on."
98291,2,"My husband and I bought the mobile ""Jake"" because it matched our bedding, lamp, etc. We were pretty disappointed in the quality and usefulness of the mobile. We thought it was way overpriced at almost $50. While it does play music, the music only last for about 2 minutes and came out sounding shrill and high-pitched. It wasn't soothing or comforting at all- I couldn't wait for it to stop playing, so I can't imagine my baby (not born yet) would enjoy such a high pitched sound. The animals that hang from the mobile are okay, but there is only 4, with no mirrors or soft lights. The best thing to say about the mobile is that it was easy to put together (we mounted it on the crib, but there is also a wall mount option). Ultimately, we decided to return it and look for something that plays better music for a better price."

49368,1,"We needed a gate for the base of our stairs to keep our one and a half year old from climbing them, but the way our stairway is set up makes it difficult to hang a regular gate. We set this up in a semicircle around the bottom of the stairs, and it works perfectly. It also spreads out so wide that we can block off sections of a room if necessary - I used it in this way when painting part of the living room; my son could watch, but couldn't get past the fence to ""help.""Edit: We've had this for a couple of years and now have baby number 2 -- the gate has held up well, and we are still using it."
125650,2,This product contains the worst assembly manual I have ever encountered in my life.Zero Stars.
56006,1,"I gave it a 5 star because i warms just like you would warm a bottle on the stove. It heats pretty fast, i just always take it early but i think it really depends on how cold the bottle is (i have to warm room temp bottles as well or my LO will not drink it!)& the amount of water you use. So follow the instructions!"
41173,2,"Pampers has changed this diaper. I have been buying Pampers for 4 years and have gone through thousands of their diapers. I bought a box on Friday and could tell immediately that they were different. My dd has leaked through 6 of the 10 diapers we used from this box. The mesh liner that used to be in these is no longer there! We have tried to contact Pampers, but have had no luck yet. We returned the box to the store and are now trying to find a new brand of diapers. I am so disappointed!"
55807,1,"I added this bottle warmer to my registry because the ""Night and Day"" warmer took up too much space on my countertop, and I am so glad I did. It is great to heat disposable Playtex bottles. I did have some problems with overheating at first, but I just learned to take the bottle out before the warmer finished to check it. I am sure if I worked a little with the water level (The 4 oz. measurement makes the bottle just a little too warm.) that I would have a perfect bottle every time. I look forward to heating baby food with it in the future. I do agree that the blue measuring cup is a little hard to read, and I plan to ask The First Years to change the color to clear. Even though it is hard to read, I have become such a pro that I can guess very closely how much water to add to the measuring cup. I only wish that there was a car adapter for it because most car warmers do not take disposable bottles. All in all, it was a great bargain, and it serves its purpose well. I plan on buying one to take to the sitter when I go back to work!"
103287,1,"We just bought this gate for the top of our stairs. My husband had it installed in less than 30 minutes. It is made of metal/steel and is soo durable and strong. Definately worth the money. We are very impressed with this gate. The ease of opening it and shutting it is so nice when going down the stairs or up. The little knob is so easy to turn for an adult, and too hard for a child. The nice white colored metal looks nice too compared to other gates I've seen. This gate makes a &quot;click&quot; noise to let you know if it has latched or not, which is very important because if it's not latched then it will not be able to do it's job- which is to protect your kids from falling! We love this gate! Highly recommended and definately worth the money."
167906,1,My daughter loves the fun princess designs and has an easy time pulling them off. Still has a bit of trouble pulling them up be the fit her very well and stop leaks. I was very impressed with them considering how underwhelmed we were with huggies brand diapers. The Huggies Pull-ups see to be much better designed.
151598,1,"I've been using this product since I was 4 months pregnant. Especially, I am pregnant with twins (you can imagine how quickly the tummy get bigger and stretch your skin) and currently 35 weeks and there is no stretch marks on my belly. Toward to the end of pregnancy (about 7 or 8 month) I started using ""Earth Mama Body Butter"" for more moisture as well. Earth Mama doesn't contain any chemical so, I feel very safe for my babies and use as much as I need. I also recommended to my friends and they love it, too. Price wise, it's very expensive to purchase at a store, but it's very reasonable price online!"
78593,1,"The first leg of the trip, this was a miracle. Everyone in the airport stopped me to ask me where I got it and how it worked. It allowed me to use the restroom in the airport without fear of my toddler running around touching all the icky things in the bathroom stall since he was strapped into his carseat. The question I have is that when I put the car seat on during the second leg of our trip, the car seat slipped down and dragged on the floor. I had to pull the carry-on almost parallel to the floor (in a very awkward way) in order to get the car seat not to drag. It became so frustrating that I just gave up and carried my son in my arms. Has anyone else had this problem? If so, do you have suggestions on how to fix it?"

177363,0,"I went back to work 3 full days a week when my son was 10 weeks old. I didn't want to spend $200+ on the PIS, so I &quot;saved&quot; money by getting the Isis for about $50 at Target. Well, I ended up getting the PIS anyways b/c it would have taken me 2x as long to pump at work. I couldn't get as much with the Isis, and with having to pump both sides... it would have just taken forever.It's OK if you just need to pump a few times a week, but if you have to go back to work at all, it will be much harder to continue pumping and breastfeeding if you don't have an electric."
32610,1,"Hearth GateJust purchased this gate which was highly recommended by a home safety consultant as being of good quality and durable. Only complaint was that when I went to install the gate sections, (The set fits hearths 6 feet wide by 2 feet deep, and it has five 24-inch sections), it became very apparent that I needed smaller sections in order to make the necessary angles to fit around our fireplace. Upon inspection I discovered that the gates plastic locking fasteners are attached with rivets and don't easily allow you to remove and then cut the gates to size so here's what I did. I drilled out the rivets and removed the (2)plastic locking fasteners,(very easy), cut the gates to size,(5 minutes with cheap hack saw), and reattached the plastic fasteners, by drilling (2) small pilots holes and then installed two small black screws. End result was very safe, very easy, and looks OEM. Saves $50.00 and waiting for a second order."

29331,0,"Be warned: this bank is only six inches tall and six inches long. I bought Mud Pie Princess banks several years ago; they were much larger and had more cute details (black Mary Jane shoes, jewels).

But it still is a very sweet little bank that, well, is OK (I guess)."

86649,2,"This basket looks so sweet and nice in the picture, but when I pulled it out of the box I couldn't believe that the hood was attached with VELCRO!! I was SOOOOOOO disappointed. I can't believe it doesn't clearly state that in the description and no other reviewer thought to mention it! The velcro completely ruins what would have been an otherwise perfect basket. So, if you don't mind cheap, tacky-looking velcro, then this basket is okay (for the price)."
150588,0,"This is the second running stroller I have owned. I bought the blue and red one. I had a very expensive brand the first time around with my older boy. This one got such good reviews and was so much less expensive that I thought I would give it a try. This stroller went together a little rough but it eventually came together. The fabric is not as good of a quality as my previous high dollar stroller, but the straps are sooooo much better in this schwinn! They fit my 6 month old boy great! He looks very comfy in it. This stroller is very well balanced and it took almost no adjusting to get it to go in a straight line. The brake pads are a little on the cheap side and will be replaced with better ones. The price is pretty good and the quality is pretty good. I gave it 3 stars because of the crunchy fabric and the lack of rain shield which has to be purchased after-market. It is nice that there are accessories that can be bought for this stroller like a baby cold weather bag and a few other do-dads. Over all, with this stroller you get what you pay for. It mirrors strollers of a much higher price with less expensive materials. It's great if you want a functional running stroller for a lower price."
43535,2,"Firstly, these baskets are advertised as being 19"" long, 17"" long and 15"" long, It even has these lengths on the box it ships in! Their ACTUAL lengths are 17.5"", 15.5"" and 13.5"" long - each basket is off by 1.5 INCHES! (the length and width are accurate). Even if the dimensions were accurate though, these baskets are cheaply made, and feel like they are abut to crumble. They smelled like spray paint com in out of the box and the blue paint looked hastily and sloppily applied. I would maybe pay $10 total for all three, but at $10 per basket, the quality is lacking."
13631,2,"This changing table went into the trash after my baby @ 8 months crawled onto the lower shelf. The shelf gave way. The shelf had previously bowed with weight over 10 lbs(baskets w/supplies and diapers).

This product is not of good quality.FYI-Top and frame are very stable."

90148,1,"pampers are soft and super absorbent. box got here pretty quickly. i have used pampers for all 3 of my kids, and it is still my brand of choice! it is a little pricier then other brands, but well worth it."
171651,1,"I received this as a shower gift and I love it! It fits the sink perfectly and is easy to clean. I haven't had any problems with leakage and my daughter loves it. But a note, the plug only turns white if you use scalding hot water, so don't use it as a guide as to whether or not the water is too warm."
131478,1,"I use this portable potty seat w/ my newly trained 3yo. It folds up nicely and can fit in the diaper bag or even my purse. Like others have stated you have to position this seat at the very front of the toilet, w/ the lip hanging over the front of the toilet. Not like seats you use at home that sit in the middle of the toilet seat.When positioned properly the seat will not slip and it works fine. I've found it to be a little flimsly with the rear portion sagging down a bit when my son sits on it, but over all it has been perfectly adequate for our use.For the price, definitely worth it for a child who isn't quite up to the regular toilet yet."
12519,2,"I received this monitor as a gift for my second baby. I have a Graco dual receiver monitor that I use for my older toddler. I have had no problems with it. The second vibrating receiver for this Fisher Price model stopped working after about 2 months. So now only one receiver works, and I'm stuck dragging the receiver upstairs and down several times a day. There is also alot of static on the receiver if there is anyone standing nearby. I have to be very careful where I place it at night, or we just hear static all night."
23186,0,"At first my little one did not like this one bit, but she is a little different (she hates the car). However, after several weeks she started using it, but hasn't claimed it to be her favorite teether (wish she would find one she loved, due to extensive teething and biting me)."
54791,1,"This mobile is fabulous, my daughter has loved it since she started sleeping in her crib at about 4 weeks. It spins and plays music for about 15mins, which is just about long enough for her to fall asleep. I can lay her down and turn it on after a night feeding and go back to bed! The only improvement I would make is a remote control, but I don't think I would use it that often."
67990,2,"I have read the reviews here, and think that there must be a VAST disparity in the quality of manufacture of these bags. The reviews indicate that they either seem to hold up just fine OR tear immediately. If you look carefully, it seems like there's a 50/50 chance of getting a good or bad bag. Not great odds!We purchased three of these to hold three lightweight umbrella strollers - two Combis and a Kinderwagon - that were going to be checked as baggage. We loaded the first one into the bag and discovered that it was nowhere near long enough to cover the stroller. We thought, ""well, that's okay, the handles will stick out..."" and then when we went to lift the stroller by the handle on the bag, the stitching along two of the bag seams completely gave way and shredded immediately. We never even got the stroller into the car, let alone to the baggage check! We didn't even unpack the other two bags. I've sent them back to Amazon, who have agreed to fully refund my money, but that still left us with no protection for the strollers. Very disappointing.Someone has recommended that we try the Sunshine Kids bag instead. In hindsight, maybe I should have ""splurged"" the extra $3 and just gotten these in the first place. Here's the link: http://www.amazon.com/Sunshine-Kids-10330-Travel-Bag/dp/B000EDL81I/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1317654095&sr;=8-4I really urge youto skip this product and keep looking."
162444,1,"We first saw this fold-up infant tub in the NICU unit where our baby stayed for her first 4 weeks. Its ability to be easily stored was a big plus in the hospital, as well as at home. The NICU nurse recommended that we line any infant tub with one of those baby bath sponges (ours is yellow and in the shape of a bear). We use our tub in the kitchen sink. Leaks, pinches and mildew have never been a problem. Oddly enough, we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards (once she could hold up her head). This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair. We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby's torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold. Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months, but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months. Our baby loves bath time!- Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds. We have used this infant tub up until this point and are just now graduating to the big tub. This fold-up tub was a great purchase for us!"
68702,2,"I can't believe so many products, for babies' sensitive private parts, have shea butter! You do not know if your child is going to be nut-allergic...so don't use products on the child that contain shea butter! I am allergic to nuts and any personal care product (lotion, wipes, etc) that contains shea butter gives me horrible hives. If your child gets a fierce diaper rash using these, consider the possibilty of an allergy..or better yet, don't use nut products like shea butter (which comes from the shea NUT) on babies when you don't know if they will be allergic...exposing them repeatedly so early on to nuts may trigger a nut allergy due to ""system overload."""
136218,1,My daughter loves this and keeps her very busy. Sometimes she seems to be overwhelmed with all the things you can do with it. All in all my 5 month really enjoys it and I think it is great exercise for her.
105028,1,"I was sceptical of this product, simply due to the fact that it is secured with sticky velcro. However, I love it! My son isn't able to rip it off and he isn't interested in trying. It's so successful for our house we are getting another one to protect grandma and grandpa's fireplace also!"
74318,1,"I love that it had adapters to plug in, and you can also use batteries if you want. The volume can also go high enough that you can hear your baby breathe (If you are like me and always worrying). I havent had any problems with static. Thats why there is 2 channels. :)~Melody"
150659,1,"Very nice looking dresser for the price. It did come with the wrong screws but amazon took care of it by giving us a discount because of the issue. My husband purchased the right size and it worked out okay. Again, it is very nice looking and works great so far."
113237,0,I bought this bag about 7 months ago and use it everyday. The plastic laminate is cracked on the corners and the strap is beginning to come loose from the bag. It wasn't worth the money I spent on it.
111133,1,"I really like this nursing cover, it is large enough to cover everything and yet not too big. There is a little pocket in the lower left side that is perfect for a nursing pad, plus it's made of terrycloth which is handy if you need to wipe up any milk. The it's well made and the material is great. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars beause I found it to be a little bit warmer than I was hoping for. It is summer and I've been running warm since I had the baby, so that could just be me. All in all, I highly reccomend this cover."
28213,1,Both my children have a pair of these. They are 5yrs and 21 months old. I love being able to eat chinese food without them stealing my chopsticks and stabbing themselves or each other. Great in the dishwasher. They also come apart for different stages of use. Highly recommended!!
141800,2,"This is a terrible product. It does not stick- it failed within 24 hours! I had hoped we wouldn't have some of the problems with sticking that others commented on, but we did. Do. Not. Buy."
154657,1,I can rest assured that they aren't leaving harmful or irritating chemicals on my baby's sensitive skin.
123448,1,This play yard is great. Folds up easy for storage. Our grandchild loves it. Great for her to practice walking with plenty of room.
44878,1,"This brand makes the best breast pumps! I originally bought a Evenflo single electric, it was very slow, it left my nipples enlarged, and sore. I first found the Medela Lactina at the hospital, and with great results. I went out and bought the home version ""In style"", which is easy to use, clean, and does not take forever just for a few ounces. I noticed in other reviews complaints about suction, and all I have to say is get the owners manual out and review the ""Troubleshooting"" section title-If there is Low or No Suction. This pump is worth the money. I love my pump and will recommend it to everyone I know."
78039,1,"There are so many reasons to like this chair. I am a neat freak and didn't want a chair with light straps that would show dirt. The dark brown straps are wonderful! She has gotten anything that stains on them and it doesn't show. I love that it lowers down easily and raises to the table. The pattern is very nice, so that it blends well with our dark tones in the kitchen. It doesn't scream ""Look at me!"". Complimented on all the time and I am loving it everyday. So easy to feed, wipe clean, and look nice while waiting for the next feeding. The wheels are squeaky when rolled to the other side of the room, but I am so grateful to have them. Some of have said they had problems with the tray, but I have not had any. Easily goes into the dishwasher and cleans up well. I LOVE this chair!!!"
97069,0,"I bought this because of other reviews, I wish I had just downloaded a cd of white noise...we take it in the car and strap around his crib rail, the rain is the most calming sound for assisting getting our son to sleep. My husband falls asleep before our son with this on."
177524,0,"Well, I did my research and bought this pump before my daughter was born. In the beginning this pump was great while I was engorged. I could pump 6 ounces in 10 minutes with great ease. I suggest you stock up in the beginning... Takes 40 minutes to get 2 ounces (baby drinks 4 at one feeding -... My advice: if you plan on breastfeeding for a short period of time this will definitely do the trick, but if you're a mom who is very dedicated to nothing but breast milk (it takes a lot of patience and great determination especially when baby is screaming for food and rejecting the breast) go for a pump-in-style and don't waste the money. You'll be much more successful especially if problems occur."
104910,1,"I really liked Dr. Bronner's Lavender soap, so I decided to try some other fragrances. While the Rose was okay, I liked the lavender fragrance better...it seemed stronger and had a ""cleaner"" smell. All of these soaps really lather up well....I only have to re-lather ONCE during a shower. The coconut oil really makes it soft, smooth and bubbly. It also washes really clean....and....it's organic! I will continue to buy this product (and it arrived in good condition in a timely fashion!)"
13326,1,This nursing stool was very comfortable. We were able to put a loveseat in the nursery so I wanted something to prop my legs up with. Great buy when you compare it with those rocking ottomans.
27805,1,I bought this stroller for my 5 month old and 2 1/2 year old. We love it. The baby can recline and our older daughter can sit up at the same time. It pushes much easier than a regular double stroller and the swivel wheel makes it easy to go for walks in town. It even makes pushing a stroller up hill easy. I would buy it all over again. It's worth the money.
26098,2,"Don't waste your money. This carrier is very deep and narrow which causes my baby to overheat easily and makes it very difficult to get her out of, which causes an otherwise calm baby to scream. It is also heavy and difficult to get in and out of the car. The sun guard is so short that it's useless. The seat is so small that I'm sure my baby will out grow it in a matter of weeks, not months. Two of my girlfriends purchased the same seat and have the same opinion. Reconsider buying this and look at Graco-they are much easier to deal with!"
30448,0,"This tub was great when my on was a newborn baby, the net was very helpful to keep him supported. Now he is 4 months old, and way too large for the net (since his weight would make the net heavy and his back would hit off of the hump on the bottom). He isn't good enough to sit up on the seat part himself yet. I do like the little shell cups that are included, and that you can attach the cup to the tub."
39217,0,"I bought this set before it came to Babies'R Us, which I love. It has washed great and it is so pretty. The fabrics are high quality and soft. However, when I ordered the valances through this web site, it took over three months to even figure out what happened to my order, and then they just failed to fill it without notifiying me (Wendy B. and Babies R Us, NOT Amazon - I got great service from Amazon). They finally told me to just give up on it becasue they did not know when, if ever, they could get it from W. Bellissimo. Needless to say, I expected much better customer service from a high end designer like W.B. Not very professional at all! A real bummer."
51108,2,"I purchased this pillow based on the description and all the enthusiastic reviews. I was highly dissapointed with my purchase. At first I thought I got a deal because my pillowcost under 50 bucks. Come to realize when I got home that it came without a pillowcase! The company wants 20 bucks for their pillowcase which is at least 50% polyester. YIKES. I made one out of a King sheet I had laying around. I found this pillow extremely uncomfortable. My legs and belly were happy with it but my head and neck were not. Each time I try to sleep with this pillow I awake with a horrible pain in the neck, and a throbbing headache. It is just to big and fluffy and does not have enough give for my head to rest comfortably."
91527,0,"Two channel receiver/transmitter. Either channel shows staticy(sp?) reception even when receiver is 10 ft away in the adjacent bathroom.So, we can only recommend looking for another product for this need."
156678,2,"My son is not very entertained by this swing yet. He only lasts about 5 minutes. It has not been worth the money for me, I'm desiring this to change because it is so easy to take along."
103035,2,"I bought this bath seat for my 6 month old, the closed design made it difficult to reach the already hard to reach places. He also kept sliding to the front of the seat, I tried putting a wash cloth down before setting him in but that didn't help. The three decretive shapes left red marks on his belly. So, we used this seat several times and ended up going to Target to get a different brand."
43394,1,"The Snugrider was a convenient purchase. It was durable and hardy, and very easy to use. One of the best purchases made."
95927,1,This is the best potty chair ever! My son is obsessed with trains and now with the Choo Choo Trainer. We have had it for a week and have not had even one accident. He can't wait to have to go to the bathroom again so he can use his new Choo Choo Trainer. Thank you Kolcraft for finally developing something that actually motivates toddlers to potty train.
95130,1,"I have used the pump in style with my first baby. I didn't like how big and noisy it was and how many parts I needed to wash. I realized that I prefer to pump one side at the time, because pumping both simultaneously caused leaking from the other breast when nursing my baby. So I got rid of it, and now for my 2nd baby I have bought the swing. I like that it is tiny, you can strap it on you pants and be completely free to move. I use batteries so I can pump anywhere, on the couch reading a book for example. It is super quite, the noise is kind of soothing actually. Very few parts. Quick pumping, I can do 4oz in 5 minutes or so, being able to adjust the suction is a great plus. The soft breast-shield included is great. I didn't find the charger attachment to be a problem at all, it stays in place just fine. If you want a great, portable pump at a reasonable price you should get this one. I am returning to work full time soon and I am not dreading the time I will spend using this pump at all. One more thing: if you want to pump in glass bottles, the evenflo ones fit the pump."
119441,0,"I bought this because I think baby ""stuff"" (stroller, swings, bouncers, etc.) takes up so much storage space and I liked the idea of folding it up to store after the baby was passed the nursing stage, plus it had good reviews.I actually think it works well for nursing, although my husband liked to laugh at me calling it my ""life preserver"" when I'd stand up afterwards and it was still connected around my waist.The biggest problem is that the air doesn't stay for long periods of time. We had to blow it up every week or two as the air slowly seeped out. And at just one month it mysteriously got a bigger leak in the middle of the night and went mostly flat. I guess I could have repaired the leak and continued using it, but by then, I was just in the mood to buy a Boppy and stop having to worry about blowing it up. Perhaps this nursing pillow should just be used for travel and not everyday use.On the pros side, once when my son had a blow out in his diaper, I just had to worry about washing the cover and I didn't need to worry about any of the mess seeping through to the pillow."
146762,1,"This is a very nice, large size scrapbook. I had a little problem with the footprint kit, but I notified the company and they sent me a replacement right away. It's easy to do the footprint, I'm just a klutz!"
139947,1,"We purchased this gate to block off a 45 inch opening. We have Chihuahua's and this works great. The sides do not move and you have to take out screws when you want to adjust the size, but we leave it the same size, so it's no problem. I would highly recommend this gate. It is very pretty and very sturdy."
84464,1,"This is a very well made product. I have twin grandbabies, a boy and a girl. They love to swing in these. What makes them super nice is the fact they have a tray which adds to better safety. The rope is super strong and much nicer than then metal ones. Love them and would highly recommend them for hours of fun and safety."
42290,1,"I have a baby who doesn't enjoy being put down - he loves to be held at all times. It's wonderful bonding time, however it's nearly impossible to get anything accomplished...until the Moby Wrap. Our baby absolutely loves being snuggled inside, and I love that he's securely wrapped up - and I can still get household tasks accomplished, eat meals, shop, etc...I can't recommend this enough! I will be purchasing one for every friend, family member, coworker, stranger who is having a baby. I can't live without this now!"
148579,1,The pillow is comfortable and better than stacking a variety of pillows but I wished it held its shape better. There isn't enough back support when lying on your side so half of the pillow seems useless.
96436,1,This is a very neat idea and very easy to install. I am not sure for all the bad reviews but it works just fine for me. It comes with some foam padding already in there to make it a tighter fit on the door handle itself. Mine could use a little more than it has but so far its workign as is. I got some command strips to hold the lock part on to the door. The supplied double sided tape cut out doesnt hold strong enough. It pulls off easy. Maybe that's where all the bad review are coming from. But if the adhesive solution doesnt work it comes with screws that can mount it in place firmly. Solved my problem. Good luck everyone else.
159255,1,"I had three different bouncers with my first daughter and we didn't like any of them. So for my second child I had no intention of purchasing one. However, at our suprise baby shower we recieved this one. I almost returned it but thought ya never know ( also because we love the ocean wonders aquarium). Anyway this bouncer has turned out to be such a life saver. The aquarium is so cute and I love that when the baby bouncers the sounds and fish are activated. Great bouncer."
28991,1,these work well with either drop in bottle by playtex.they last longer than the latex ones.
162465,2,"I got this tub because of its price and the fact that it folds up. I used it once on my countertop with no problem, but I decided to try it in the sink. While bathing my 3 week old ten pound son, the locking mechanism on one side snapped, collapsing the tub and scaring my son.I returned this tub immediately and purchased a solid model that can't snap like that. The Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub is MUCH better. It's a few dollars more and a bit bigger, but it's definitely worth it. I've had it for a few weeks now and my son absolutely loves the bath. It is much more secure than this tub and though it takes up more space in our small apartment, I would never go back to the Fold-Up Tub."
54598,1,"I had not intened to purchase a moblie for my son, thinking that I wanted him to only associate his crib with sleep. However when we decided to have him sleep in his crib at night (at 10 weeks)it was clear he wanted nothing to do with being in the crib. I had heard that this moblie was wonderful so my husband and I decided to give it a try. Our son loved it from the moment we started it. We call the animals on the mobile his &quot;friends&quot;. He now goes into his crib with no problems and will coo and talk to the animals for long enough to catch a shower or a short break for mom during the day.We did have trouble with the first one we bought with the motor squeaking, but we returned it and have no problems with the new one. We did have to put a piece of cardboard between the crib and the bolt to keep it firmly in place.I definitly think thiis is a &quot;must have&quot;. I hate to think of the day when we have to take his &quot;friends&quot; down."
94721,1,"After a year of using this product: When I went to edit my rating, I could not change the stars... but I'd give them 3.5 stars now. These are still decent wipes, but they have not retained their softness and have a few 'pills' now. I definitely prefer the plain Gerber wash cloths now.My original review: I have these in rotation with Gerber wash cloths, but the All Together brand wipes are my favorite. I keep them moist in a wipe warmer, so they're ready to go when needed. They are soft and thin... perfect for cleaning all the nooks of baby's bottom!"
87192,1,"Like many people, having my blood pressure measured in a doctor's office usually results in an artificially high reading. After my most recent visit to my family physician he recommended that I buy a blood pressuse monitor and measure my blood pressure at home every day. At first I bought a monitor which measures blood pressure at the wrist, but I had difficulty getting consistent readings with it. A friend who is a retired physician recommended that I get an upper-arm-positioned monitor and specifically recommended Omron, so I bought this HEM 780 monitor. I'm very pleased that I did. The readings with this monitor are much more consistent than those obtained with the wrist monitor and, as I suspected would be the case, are significantly lower than values obtained in my doctor's office. The monitor is very easy to use and functions completely automatically once you turn it on and press the start button. After each measurement it digitally displays both the systolic (higher) value, diastolic (lower) value, and the pulse plus the date. Furthermore it saves these values sequentially for the 90 most recent measurements -- a real convenience for comparing values over time. The monitor operates with AA bateries (which I prefer for convenience) or, for economy, with an AC adaptor which is included. I highly recommend this product."
73392,2,"I got mines 2 weeks ago,and I have not really used it because,the baby tell's me when his hungry or in pain etc..so,it was worthless,I lost the orginal box so,I can NOT return it..If you get it wait TILL baby is born bc some babies do tell you if there hungry is high pitch cry and if there bored...they start kicking and playing with there hands etc...bunch of bs..having to own this piece of crap I plan on selling it on cragislist and see if I can get something for my money."
22773,0,"I ordered this Graco Pack N Play Playard to use as a gift. The Graco Playard is a wonderful product, but I found out FOUR (4) days after ordering that the recipient already had one. When I checked to see about returning the product, there was a notice that there was a return window of THREE (3) days from when the order was PLACED to return it and get full credit. I received the playard after 6 pm on day TWO (2). This is vastly different from the stated return policy for baby items in the help section."
149364,2,"When I first bought this for my second child, I thought this would be great because it is small and easy to clean and keep clean. My two-month old hates it and it makes bathtime a nightmare. He slides down constantly and hits the ""safety"" bar that keeps him from sliding directly into the tub that hurts his little privates. I never feel like he is safe in this seat because it really doesn't hold him securely."
143954,2,"The instructions for this product suck but it's sort of a commonsense type of installation anyway. Upon opening and beginning installation procedures, we realized that the newel post is too close to the next baluster/spindle and the entire installation kit has been rendered useless!WARNING: Must have at least 1.5 inches of space next to your newel post in order for the bulky plastic clamp in this installation kit to work. I would just take out the spindle, but then my toddler could just crawl through the sizable hole that would be left in its absence which would defeat the whole purpose of having a baby gate on the stairs.I felt kind of stupid for not thinking about how much room might be needed next to the newel post before I ordered the product, but I didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake. Measure how much room you'll have for the clamp before you buy this kit and waste your money like I did."
14201,1,"I have 11 Avent bottles all purchased at seperate times and have never, not once had any one of them leak. They are more expensive, but think about the money the Playtex Nurser liners cost over the course of your baby's bottle years, it adds up! Also, with the Avent system you can buy spouts that convert the bottles into Sippy cups and save money on new cups. I have also used Second Nature brand nipples with the Avent bottles and they worked perfectly, those of you having problems with Avent leaking, but like the style of Avent Bottles and nipples may want to check out that brand (sold at Target.com and babycenter.com)"
19046,2,"I got one of these as a gift. I never use it. There are major flaws with these slings.1: The rings they use are craft rings, NOT sling rings. That might not sound like a big deal, but it is. The rings are too thin, and too small for the amount of fabric going through them. That makes the sling VERY hard to adjust, and the rings will bend and warp as a result of trying to get the sling properly adjusted. *Good* sling rings will not bend or warp, they are too thick and sturdy for that.2: The pouch design makes it a poor choice for newborns or smaller babies. Small babies will slip into pouch, putting them in danger of re-breathing air. And that puts in danger of brain damage and death. Remember those pouch slings that were recalled a few years ago? It was for that very reason that they were recalled.3: The pictures Amazon has show improper baby-wearing techniques. In the pictures, the top rail is not NEARLY tight enough, making it far too easy for baby to fall out. Note how the moms (and dads) are leaning awkwardly to one side, while supporting their babies with their hands -- this is not safe for parent or baby! If the baby were properly secured, the parent would not need to use any hands to support the baby and would be able to stand up straight.Seriously. Spend more money and good a good quality sling, like a Maya Wrap, Sakura Bloom, or Zolowear. Your back and baby will thank you!"
61048,2,"Diaper genie works good for the first 7 months because the babys poop doesn't smell too strong yet, after that the diaper genie begins the smell really bad."
99707,1,"Our baby was started on Pampers Swaddlers when he was born, and as he has grown, we have stuck with the brand to great success. Pampers Baby Dry diapers are thin, easy to open, and very absorbent. They are very easy to apply one handed, which is virtually a necessity as baby gets older and more mobile.We have very few leaking incidents with these diapers. Any leaks that have happened are usually due to the diapers not being put on properly. I have found that as long as we take our time when putting them on, they don't leak. They are also very absorbent. Our baby is a very active diaper filler, and these diapers can usually hold several hours and all night.Compared to the other diapers that we tried in order to save money (Huggies, Luvs, etc), these diapers work the best and with the subscribe and save program, are a great value as well."
143896,1,These back iof car seat protectors are a great product. I received them in good time and are very happy with them.
23035,1,"FANTASTIC product! I buy this for all my new mother friends. I use Playtex Drop In bottles and it's perfect. The older saucer lids fit better, but the bubble lid works too (a little snug). I use this for running errands and all excursions (state fair, 3 mile walk). I don't like using ice paks (slimy) and love that the cooler disk in sewn into the bottle and not accessable. You basically put the entire cooler into the freezer and pop in a bottle before you leave. The strap has a little velcro on it so you can secure it to your stroller/shopping cart. I've gone on long trips with this (four hours) and the milk was still very cold. I've left it in the car in the intense San Antonio summer heat, and it was still cold."
60239,1,"When I first reviewed this baby tub I was talking about how much my daughter hated it!! She was so uncomfortable. I stated that it was probably because she was on the small side (premature baby). Anyway, last night I decided to try the tub again (I had not used it for almost six weeks) this time she LOVED it.I really don't know if there is a height/weight recommondation for this tub, but I do know that my daughter likes it better at 9lbs rather than 6 or even 7lbs. Anyway, now that she likes it I can see how it is more comfortable then the others. This tub doesn't have bars on it to stop a child from sliding when they are sitting up, and it summerges the baby's body in the water, rather then letting the baby sit in a few inches. That in itself is great because my daughter loves to kick and hit her hands in the water.Also, it has two little holders on either side of the infant head area. I'm assuming they are for the baby soap or a wash cloth, maybe even a few tub toys, but I find that it is perfect for my engagement and wedding bands or even a pacifier.I also love how securly this tub fits into my tub. I have no worries about it sliding around! All in all this tub is THE PERFECT tub. The only problems I could see people having with it is of course a little baby's comfort level. Which can easily be corrected with a baby tub bath sponge, or they can do what I did and just bathe their baby in a regular tub or take it in the shower with them. Also, the tub could be considered huge. It is significantly bigger than the other tubs, but it still fits in a standard size bath tub (although it is quite snug), and of course the bigger tubs!"
37231,1,"my husband and i love this bag. the size of the bag is just what we needed. we have been using this bag for over a year and half when my son was just a newborn and now a toddler ... it is very versatile. i fit what i needed in the bag: a blanket, a pant, a shirt, 3 diapers, two packs of wipes, 2 napkins, a cup, a snack box, eating utensils, a bottle of water, 2 little toys, a stick of sunblock, and my stuff - a purse, a cellphone, car keys and a digital camera.this bag also fit on stroller if you do not want to carry it. i find the compartments sufficient. in the interior it also has dividers, on the top opening there are two zipper compartments, on the side they include a diaper mat compartment and i fit my 3 diapers and wipes, and the two front pockets are for easy access. just all in one a great bag to have for any parents."
84162,1,"I'm glad to see SOME baby items in bold colors. After all- high contrast is what newborns can actually detect! This fits on a standard changing table pad fairly well, and the material is fine. It's a good deal for the price."
155635,1,"I have 3 kids 7,4, and 2. I wish I had this product sooner. I've only had this potty for about 2 months and I love it. All 3 of my kids have used it when we were in a pinch. I travel quite frequently with my 3 kids, by myself, to visit family 12 hrs away. This comes in so handy. When one has to go, it's so much easier to use this in the back of my SUV than to take all three kids into a gas station restroom. I also have found this very convenient for when the kids are in the back yard playing in the sandbox and running under the sprinklers. I just set up on our back screened in porch. It's quick and less messy.I wish I had this 6 yrs ago."
179592,1,"This makes going through the airport so much easier. Would highly recomend. My 2.5 year old loved riding in it and gernerally isn't happy with strollers anymore so that was a bonus. Handled great, was able to push it with one hand while pulling lugage with the other."
5167,1,Seventh generation diapers are wonderful diapers. I recently started using them on my 5 month old due to concerns about all the extra chemicals/toxins in standard diapers. He was also 'blowing out' of the standard Pampers. SG diapers are higher on the back end so they contain more. They are also super absorbant and my little guy has not had any diaper rashes since we started using them. I would say that the higher price is worth it. Amazon has the best deals b/c you can get 4 packs delivered right to your door w/out any shippping/handling.
95052,1,"This one is fairly quiet and I use it 3 times per day. The only downside to this one is when you first get it you should wear out the little white tab that's on the yellow piece where the milk would come out from and I would do this by bending it. The reason being is that your milk can collect in the head when the tab doesn't flip open to release the milk and it gets sucked up in to the tube and you will then have to rinse it out, connect it back and run the pump to dry it out before using it again which is a pain in the ass but with a little bending you should be good to go...it doesn't happen to me anymore.Another thing, don't listen to people who claim it only pumps a certain amount for them...everyone is different and produces different amounts of milk, it has nothing to do with the strength of the pump, if it could get any stronger your nipples would fall off. It's comfortable and you can adjust the suction to your liking...I find it more painful to breast feed than pump so I pump. I do however recommend massaging your breast while pumping to be able to release more milk since it can get trapped in the ducts. Of course...no pump will do as well as the suction of a baby but this pump gets the job done."
112264,0,"My son uses pamper since day one. I was very happy with cruisers before, but the new pampers cruisers has a new liner which leave a lot white bead-like stuff on my son's bottom. After looking those previous review, I know I am not along."
79339,1,"After going to babies r us several times, i finally went to another baby website and found the zanzibar 6 piece set for $40 cheaper. with free shipping and no tax. so it is a great set, but am glad i looked around before buying it."
171109,0,"Pros: nice that it holds so many photosCloth cover is nicePages are secure, so baby can chew on them without harming photosCons: very difficult to insert photosSee plastic around edges of 4x6 photo -- so doesn't look terrificPlastic bubbles around picturesKind of cheap lookingSo, overall, this does the trick, but is not terrific."
13648,1,"This gate is amazing. After suffering through gates that destroyed my walls, this free-standing gate is what the doctor ordered. Easy to assemble and no need to move it, because you can just step over the gate. Plus, you can assemble it a little less wide than you need and your cat can get through to his food bowl, but the dog can't. Great product!"
82461,1,"I have 4 children ages, 6, 6, 4 & 2. We bought this stroller to replace out Kolcraft Lil' Limo. It was just to bulky and so heavy to steer. We were headed to Disney and decided to look into something lighter. We found the Combi. WOW what a differance. We actually bought the Twin Savvy Sport first and took that to Disney, we liked it but the rear center axel was bend to we returned it when we got home (after contacting Combi to see about warrenty issues, they told us to take it back). But while in Disney the Twin Savvy Sport worked perfectly..at the airport, at the hotels, and in the parks. We were actually caught in a rain storm and the thing dried amazingly quickly.When we returned the Sport, we purchased the EX. LOVE IT TOOThe Pros:* Light weight* Easy of moving it around...you can actually use 1 hand* Kids love the comfy seats* Canopies are wonderful...great to shade the baby when he sleeps* Ours came with the accessory pack...LOVE IT holds drinks, and keys, cell phone, etc.* What a difference the cup holders make. After getting the Sport without the cup holders we realized how much the extra money was worth having them. The baby really missed having his cheerios when he wanted them.* We even put our 6 year olds in it when the were tired (they weigh 40lbs each) and the thing still steered perfectly.* Easy of going through doors* Folding it up for the airplane was a breeze* Going up and down side walks was so easy.CONS* Small basketsI really can't think of any other cons and the small baskets are only and issue when I am shopping, so I bought hooks from Baby's R US that will hold light weight bags from the handle and this works fine.My best friend even went out and bought one for her almost [...] She loves it to !!!"
151600,1,I seriously love this oil! I use this everyday twice a day...not greasy and absorbs well. 6 months pregnant and no stretchmarks yet. I even use this as bath oil. The smell is wonderful. I am very sensitive to smells and can't use any of the &#34;smelly&#34; lotions. This is so pleasant smelling and does wonders on my skin. I will keep using this well after the baby. So glad I found.
38512,1,"This is by far the most comfortable item ever invented for baby.Baby doesn't slip, baby is comfortable, baby enjoys bathing and more importantly, mom feels at ease knowing that her baby is safe while she bends to pick up the towel or reaches over for the baby soap. The baby doesn't move or wiggle around and kudos to whoever invented this product."
159618,1,"My son is now 5 mo's and has been using this since he was a few days old (with a neck support pillow when younger). It probably is his favorite. He's never lost interest in it. It's been a big help when I need to set him down to make a bottle, etc.. He loves watching the fish! When he was younger, the vibration would relax him & put him to sleep. The cover comes off very easy for washing. I can't find anything negative about this bouncy! I'd buy it again!!"
83253,1,"I have worn my son in the baby sling since he was two weeks old, and he is now 15 months old - and it is still comfortable as ever! There are so many ways to wear your child in the sling, and the baby is so close to your body - more so than with a Baby Bjorn. My son also loves the sling, and it is a life saver when you have a screaming baby at your feet when you are trying to get something done. Furthermore, you feel SO much safer in an airplane, when you wear your child close to your body. Your child is as strapped to you as you are to the seat, in turbulence etc. GET THE SLING - I AM TELLING YOU, YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT!!"
35337,1,I was needing something to go that little extra to help protect my daughter from the sun....well this is it. It's easy to put on and off. I'm really glad I found this product.
127631,1,"We bought this crib to be able to accomodate our granddaughter when she visits. It's beautiful, and both my daughter and her baby loved it. It has a wonderful rocking feature, and you could rock the baby to sleep. The crib also fits through doors without having to fold or disassemble. We could carry it from the bedroom to the family room without a problem. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
150513,2,"This is an irk with the manufacturer. It arrived in perfect time, in perfect condition with ""cherry"" finish indicated on all the outside markings and labels. Opened it and it was NOT CHERRY. It was white. Someone in the plant is FIRED.Am returning it for a replacement. Will update then."
170312,1,My husband bought a costo and I hated it the straps were always twisted and it seemed hard to take apart to clean.I bought the marathon and love it. the marathon is also easier to install with the latch straps than other seats we've had. britax contacted us about the recall and sent new parts even though we didn't have a problem
167186,1,We were very impressed with this car seat. It gives you several installation options and it was quick and easy to install. All of the buckles and straps operate smoothly and once it is installed it is rock solid. We paid a little extra to have this seat but it is also built well enough that it should last us for several more years/ children. I would highly recommend this seat to others.
69455,2,"We were given these dipes as gifts from our friends for our twin boys. We had always used huggies with our first, but they were free so we tried them. They left a HORRIBLE rash on my red-headed son's bottom. We were going through SO many diapers a day (24 or more, let the environmentalists cringe) so it was NOT a matter of poor changing habits. It was not the breast milk. I know for a fact the diapers caused this rash because the rash was checkerboard looking like the mesh liner. It was insane! We spent over $[...] in OTC rash creams and eventually had to get two prescriptions from the doctor to clear it up because once the skin is broken it becomes much harder to heal since the area is constantly being aggravated with nitrogenous waste. We now will use huggies supreme OR pampers baby dry...no problems with those. My friend's red-headed daughter had the exact same thing happen, so I'm thinking parents of kids with sensitive skin might want to think twice about buying a huge pack of these."
115870,2,I was looking for an umbrella stroller a little nicer than the usual 20$ ones but didn't want an expensive one either. So I chose this and after using it for a couple weeks I wish I had chosen something different. My husband complains about the fact that the handles aren't tall enough so it doesn't keep the stroller far enough away from him so he is constantly kicking the wheels. I am only 5'7 and I kick the wheels when I am walking behind it to! Its so frustrating! And as far as getting it to fold down...you either have to use your shoe (which is gonna end up being messed up) and use your hand (which you're gonna end up pinching your finger) because its a pretty tough clasp! It is however lightweight and doesn't take up a whole lot of room but I just would have rather spent a little bit more money and gotten one I want to use after all my child is gonna be riding in this awhile!!!
170136,1,This is a great crib. My baby loves it. Everytime I put him in it he gets really excited. It is also a great finish and very sturdy. I also like that is can convert to a toddler bed with just a few adjustments. The crib arrived in a torn up box with missing hardware. I contacted the makers and they were great. With no charge or hassle they sent me the missing parts. This crib is a great price for what you get.
94169,1,"I previously gave this item 4 stars, because it couldn't be shortened sufficiently to accomadate taller/longer babies. I'd like to edit that review, but I have tried three times now, and my reiview hasn't changed.ANYWAY... my husband was reading the instruction manual... I have a bad habit of not doing this myself. If something seems obvious, I don't bother reading up on it. Well, with this jumper, there is an &quot;obvious&quot; way to shorten it, and also a &quot;not so obvious&quot; way to shorten it. Once my husband figured out the not so obvious way... well, let's just say that if I weighed about about 110 pounds less, we could in fact shorten this device enough for me to use it! (I'm 5'4...)So, now I give this device 5 stars, two thumbs up, etc. etc. Wonderful product!!!"
93416,1,"Very timely delivery. Well-made, sturdy, rolls along easily, and the handles are at a really comfortable height for average & tall adults. Good-sized, sturdy sunshade with zip-out back so seat can recline. There is a medium-size storage rack for a baby bag at the back/bottom of the stroller. Also has a convenient separate pocket on the back of the seat to hold the included rain cover so you can access it quickly in case of sudden showers. Comes with one plastic clamp-type cup holder bracket on right side handle for easy adult access. Easy to push when open, but heavier to carry than most typical ""umbroller""-type stroller; but again sturdier than most. Love it...Good buy!"
68301,1,I use this product as an body wash including hair and face. It's gentle and makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. I would highly recommend it.
176355,1,"I love this pump, I have had it for about 1 1/2 months. I use it almost every day because then I can really see how much milk my baby is drinking. the only thing I don't like is that it's a little noisy so, I use my manual pump late at night."
70152,0,"The product was exactly what I was looking for. Great for changing diapers. Soft cotton to absorb messes and a plastic backing to prevent seepage. When the courier van arrived, the delivery person was carrying some of the underpads in hand along with the cardboard box that contained the rest. Upon questioning the situation, their response was ""Uh, the box must have ripped."" Really??? A closer inspection reveals that the shipping tape was a bit on the the thin, flimsy side and tore. One of the box flaps opened and about fourteen underpads are either dirty and/or torn. A word to the supplier Direct Care Store (and/or Kendall Company), use better tape or use more of it. Direct Care Store, is offering me a refund except for the $12.00 for shipping and handling. In my opinion, that will eat up too much of the cost of the transaction so I will use what I can and discard the rest. I have purchased a similar brand of underpad from Amazon but through a different supplier (NorthShore) and at a higher price. Their packages were always great and their pads were also double wrapped in clear plastic bags (possibly to prevent the product from damage in the event that the cardboard shipping box opened somehow during shipping). I was trying to save a few bucks and it wound up costing me more in the end. As a result, I will not buy from the Direct Care Store again and will go back to the NorthShore supplier. I must say that Amazon was great at getting the Direct Care Store to respond to my complaint. I love Amazon."
92558,0,I was so excited to get this but then dissappointed when the food jammed and it took forever because I kept having to take it apart. On softer foods it worked ok. Our baby surpassed the need for food this mushed up and moved on very quickly. Not really worth the money.
12352,2,I was given this as a gift at my baby shower and I was very happy. This monitor has nice music in where you can control the volume and a cute light show that automatically turns on when the baby crys and puts my child back to sleep. The only thing that I do not like is when my son is crying I do not hear him through the monitor I can hear him from the other room and I know something is wrong with him since the music is playing even with the volume turned to the max on the monitor the baby crys are muffled and cannot be heared through the monitor. I can't take product back to store since I threw away packaging I should have read other customer reviews first.Not so happy Noemi V.-NYC
105934,1,"We wanted to buy this product to get away from purchasing the bags for some of the other diaper disposals. It was great before our little one started on baby food. Now that her poop stinks more than it did we have some odor, but it is not bad. We have always put a trash bag in there to catch the diapers. Now I have a deodorizer in there and for a poopy diaper I just wrap it in a plastic bag before dropping it in there. I use the produce bags from the grocery so it is cheap. I would recoommend it, but with caution about the possiblity of a smell."
25289,2,"This product keeps sticking out of the car seat to the point that we had to tape it down to the car seat. The tying ropes are really silky and slippery and keep getting lose. The protector keeps sticking out also because it has hard edges which do not mold to the car seat. This could have been such a nice product, but it is not practically made."
11734,1,"I love this tub!! That said, yesterday the floor seam separated from the walls, but only after 3-4 months of use. Even still, this tub was perfect for my son. He is 30 inches tall and 30 pounds, but he is only 10 mos. old. He is, obviously, too big for a classic infant tub, but it seems like a waste to fill the regular bathtub for a bath that only lasts 10 min. The SnugTub has been a perfect solution. Despite my son's long legs, he fits easily in the tub and has lots of room to splash and even turn around. Despite the tears, I have been very, very pleased with this purchase and will probably buy another."
171192,1,"THIS IS THE BEST TUB TO OWN BECAUSE IT IS MULTI- FUNCTIONAL AND YOU CAN USE IT BEYOND INFANCY. TOO MANY PRODUCTS ARE CREATED FOR SMALL INFANTS, BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR INFANT GROWS UP? THIS TUB ALLOWS YOUR GROWING BABY TO TRANSITION INTO THE SITTING POSITION AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY A NEW TUB. MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS TUB. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING OTHER TUBS THAT CLAIM TO BE MULTI- FUNCTIONAL, WE DID AND FOUND THAT THIS IS THE ONE TO OWN!"
121362,1,"My daughter loved this from the moment we got it!! When we first assembled it her toes barely touched the floor, but all the toys kept her entertained and active. She especially enjoys the little alien with the mirror and ball rattle. The gender neutral theme gives this more bang for your buck, as it can be used when our friends bring over their sons (and in case we have another child!!). We love this so much and highly recommend this very sturdy, entertaining walker/ activity center."
52852,1,"Our son was born nine weeks early and weighed only three pounds. This was one of the only products that fit his size. He would peacefully snuggle in and fall right to sleep. The vibrating feature was great, but we would rarely use the music because it was rather loud.Now that he is 6 months he doesn't use it as much because it is not as interesting as his other toys and playmats. Overall a great product for newborns!"
7297,1,"I shopped online for a while before finally choosing this bed, and I did so based on the reviews. I have been very happy with it to date. I believe we've now had it for about two months. It is a nice little bed for the price. I'm sure it's possible to buy fancier, or even sturdier, but this is more than meeting my expectations so far. What can I say? I'm very happy with this purchase. Oh, by the way, I put it together myself in 23 minutes. No problems!"
70022,1,"I got this as a bridal shower gift or I probably never would've bought one. As a new mom, I didn't plan on being out of my baby's sight. It took me a few months to try it and learn to trust it. From then on, it's one of our most popular baby devices. I feed my horses and dogs while my daughter sleeps or plays in her pen without worry. It picks up the slightest of sounds. I use it when I'm upstairs in the shower and she stays in her pen sleeping. It saves the hassle of moving her closer to me and waking her up or disturbing her play time. It has tremendous range and the portable or plug in feature is quite practical. I think it is a great way to keep an eye on your little one when you need to run outside, shower, or be in another room altogether. I'm very please with this product."
149605,1,"This is a very thick mattress and it fits the bottom of my child's ""Graco Modern Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Zurich"" perfectly. One thing to note: I also purchased a water-proof liner for the mattress but it is not necessary because this mattress is made of water-proof material."
59304,1,This railnet works well in preventing my kids from throwing toys over my stair rail.
71473,2,"i was looking for a good priced effective product for our newborn,if u r looking to throw your money in the trash it would be easier than buying this product,the thermometer came without battery and stopped working within the first week of use,the nasal suction is big even for my nose(30 years old)and u won't be able to use it on an infant,the only thing that works is the comb.bottom line spend few more dollars and get a decent set"
25696,0,"I haven't had a whole lot of luck with it, but I think it's just my situation. Give it a try."
71146,0,My sister has this seat and it is just ok ....its great that it turns into a toddler seat and baby seat but her son is two now and he figured out how to take the screws out of the sides and it is now broken so not so good...I on the other hand have this seat BUT it is a newer version and it is all plastic still rocks still turns into a todler seat and it also has legs to put down to stop the rocking and adjustable back to make it lay back more or sit up....and mine is awesome it vibrates and has a swinging toy bar. so before you decide to buy this one search for the plastic looking one i found mine at babies r us so it should be on here...i would def reccomend it....but this one is a little more hazardous
152094,1,"I ordered these sheets after struggling to find sheets that would fit my Davinci 50 coil mini crib mattress. The mattress is shorter than a normal crib mattress, yet very thick, so it's been near impossible finding sheets that fit. I read some Amazon reviews and was lead to buy the American Baby Company porta-crib sheets. These sheets ended up fitting, but were VERY snug and I kind of worry they will pop off in the middle of the night. However, these portable crib sheets were the PERFECT size! I know that the Kalani mini crib is quite popular, and that most people buy the 50 coil mattress to with it, so listen up! THESE SHEETS FIT THE BEST! Second best fitting sheets would be the Gerber crib sheets that you can order online from Babies R Us, but I'm not sure if they're going to continue making them or not because they are advertised as sheets for normal cribs, but shrink - making them the perfect size for the mini crib."
38583,1,This is by far the best infant bather EVER! I have used the traditional hard tubs and this one is as good as all of its positive reviews. My baby loves it and stays comfy during bathtime. Once we are done a simple rinsing and hanging to dry in a well ventilated area and it is ready to be used again the next day! I love it and would recommend it without any hesitation.
67923,1,"Two of the toys that hang are detachable. There aren't any clear instructions. I didn't really think many were necessary but looking at what it did come with, it became clear that the safety straps for the arch needed to go through the tiny slots. It didn't state that those rings come off and it's so much easier. The rings that hold the piece on the top do twist and then pull off. It is easier to thread the safety loops through if you can get that off. There are also supports on the back that swivel out and a velcro cloth covering that hold it flat. It folds up quickly and nicely and fits back in the package with little effort for traveling."
6266,0,"The infrared has died on me once on this camera and twice on the Sight and Sound model before this one. And the video monitor died on this model. All of this within 3 years. Also, a friend of mine has the same model and his infrared has died twice. However, the picture is great and audio has very little interference. Also, the company did a great job of replacing the defective parts at no cost during the warranty period. Bottom line: great video and audio, but be prepared for it to die young."
174201,1,"This is the best swing ever!!! Because it reclines back and is so comfy for baby, I was able to use it when my son was a newborn, before he was able to hold his head up. He's almost 6 months old now and he still loves it. He sleeps in it all the time. At first, I almost feared he'd prefer it over his crib. The motor is quiet and the little bugs and leaves that spin above him are so cute, he loves them. Even moreso, he LOVES the mirror, he looks at himself all the time and just laughs. My friends' babies have all loved using it when they're over. My only complaint is that the music and mobile do stop after 7 minutes and you have to hit the reset button if your baby is still awake and enjoying that part of the swing. But it's worth getting up to see him smile again. I recommend this swing to everyone! It's a real must-have and has been a lifesaver for us!"
169659,2,"This organizer is great in that it straps to the back of a chair. I keep it on one of my dining room table chairs and I keep a changing pad on the table. But the top two shelves are useless. They don't have sides, so they can't hold anything. Manufacturer should put sides on the top shelves in the future. Also, the mesh cubbies at the top are pretty small and don't hold much."
126391,0,"These diapers I would put in second place versus Pampers but definitely stay away from the Supreme. They don't hold enough liquid causing a leak and the elastic was always falling apart. So i stick with pampers, but Huggies wipes are better."
170416,1,"Not only do I love the look of this car seat and the ease of use, but I was in a very bad crash with my 2 year old son in which I rolled my Land Rover and when the car stopped, his car seat had not even budged or come loose in the slightest. I fully attribute the quality and compatibility of this car seat with LATCH to be the reason that my son came away completely unharmed!"
107159,1,"Since I had to do my baby registry by reading books etc. as I was stuck in bed, I had time to read review on every item and we decided on the diaper champ. We absolutely love it. You do not get any odor. We change the bag twice a week on garbage days. A big plus is that we can use regular garbage bags and we do not have to worry about getting to a store to buy special bags and wasting that money. The only down side is if you have a very dirty diaper the tube where the diaper goes gets dirty and is a bit of a pain to clean, but that only happens on extremely dirty diapers which we only get once in a while.This is a great purchase."
96312,1,"cute item, bought them to go with additional lids for her to travel with for no spills in the car"
110570,1,"Folds up compactly, has good coverage and even a place for the wipes box. We bought 2 since we have twins (and 2 diaper bags)."
157314,0,"We finally put this changing table together today since we're expecting our son to make his entrance within a month. The quality of the piece is very good for the price. The changing table did acquire a few kinks during shipping, but a ""blemish marker"" was included in the package, so kinks are hardly noticable once smoothed over.However, this piece of furniture is *VERY* complicated to assemble - I consider myself to be pretty handy, but it took my husband and I 3 hours to put the piece together. The instructions are mostly spot-on and easy to figure out, but we did run into the problem of confusing two kinds of almost identical black screws (one type is slightly bigger than the other) and could not complete one of the very last cosmetic steps since we had already used up the bigger screws at the start of the assembly.Also, we had some pieces leftover that didn't seem to be required... but better too many than not enough!Once assembled, the table is gorgeous and looks more expensive than it was, we really like it and it's very easy to accessorize! - but be aware that assembly is quite a headache. What's not mentioned here is that you'll need two people, a hammer and a versatile screwdriver (standard, phillips and robertson) to put this together and the fact that one of the safety steps recommends screwing the table to the wall, which we can't do as it would violate our townhouse renting contract. While it doesn't seem like a safety hazard for at least a few years (if at all), it's worth making sure that won't be an issue if you're renting!"
132505,1,"It works. We've had it for a couple of weeks and we're very pleased. Wiping a newborn in the middle of the night with a cold wipe wasn't helping our lack of sleep. One minor thing, I wish we could turn the amber-on light off, but other than that, it is perfect. At first I confused the warm feeling of the wipe for being dry so I placed clear food storage wrap over the plastic top of the warmer. No moisture collected on the plastic film. The bottom wipes are not dried out or discolored. If anything changes, I'll update the review.--UPDATE---Baby is nearly 9 months old and this is still a great wipe warmer. The rubber-like material that helps separate wipes as you extract them ripped a couple of months ago, but it still functions fairly well. Would buy again."
177980,1,"The mat is cushioned and comfortable, colorful. Baby has fun making the toys rattle."
86748,1,I just carried a gallon of milk and 4 lbs of oranges in a doubled plasic bag....the store is about 1/2 mile from my house. This hook is awesome. The bottom of the stroller would have been dragging with all that weight.
117531,0,"My 4 month old loves this swing! He laughs and smiles and bounces a lot.Don't use if it your child can't support his own head yet. Its really for babies 4 months and up.UPDATE:My son is 6 months old. He still loves it, but even at the maximum adjusted setting its too close to the ground. My baby is tall, and if your baby is too then this product is not useful for very long. Now, his legs are bent when he sits in it and he can even put the lower half of his leg from his knee down flat on the ground."
52022,0,"We have 3 month old twins and I have one of these and an old school blue babybjorn. When we travel through airports we use these. The advantage of this gray & white carrier is that the fasteners at the top snap in quite nicely, much nicer than they did in past models.This is also more minimalist in design than the other model...I guess it's supposed to be more sporty, but it feels less secure.I still find this quite an uncomfortable product and would suggest new parents to consider other brands of slings etc. to carry their babies. After about half an hour of carrying around one of the little guys in this my back really starts to hurt. and the belt strap going across looks odd...it's white but the inside is grey (not matching the other straps...really an odd choice, must be a scandahoovian design."
165935,0,"I got a sample of this diaper sent to me by Pampers, and I absolutely loved it - so soft and luxurious, it was the perfect diaper. The problem? I loved it so much that I went out to buy a big pack, only to discover that the actual product was not as soft nor as smooth as the sample. I was VERY disappointed, and honestly, felt kind of cheated."
123480,1,"After doing extensive searching for a playard, this one was the best choice. The colors are vibrant which is great for babies, and the ""bugs"" on the side are very entertaining for the baby too. It is sturdy and surprisingly roomy. My only complaint would be that it is a little on the heavy side and set up is a little complicated. But overall, My child loves it, so it is worth the extra work. I recommend this product to anyone wanting to buy a playard."
54314,1,"I bought this for my preemie daughter because i wanted something interesting, developmental and educational for her to look at and listen to and this has everything! I'll lay her in her crib and hit the on/off button and she will just STARE at the mobile the entire time it's on! It's a fantastic distraction that gives me a chance to take a shower or run and start a load of laundry, she doesn't make any noise while it's on, but will certainly let me know when the music stops! I love that it plays classical music! I was a little annoyed at first because the beads sliding make a little noise, but you get used to it after awhile. I've had it in her crib for over 3 weeks and we play it OFTEN - sometime several times in a row...and I haven't had to change the batteries yet, but if you're concerned about investing alot of $ in batteries, get rechargable."
57261,0,"This car seat is really nice, however the directions are hard to follow. I have a 2005 Honda Accord and it is hard to turn the car seat rear facing and still have room. I haven't actually got it installed the way I want it to be. I am gonna go to the state partol to let them install it the way it should be. This would be a good car seat for someone who has an SUV with a lot of room."
80376,1,"Great milk storage bag. Very clean and since it has a double zip loc closure, it stays fresh in the freezer.I highly recommend it!"
75793,1,"Bought this Ultra Mat to protect my very expensive leather seats in my 2010 Armada. The Mat is functional and performs as advertised. My child seat doesn't slip as others have warned and it matches my charcoal interior without drawing attention to itself.My only real negative is the cheap strap the wraps around the headrest to ""secure"" the Ultra Mat. It's pretty cheap and questionable as to how long it may hold up. I would have preferred a more robust attachment mechanism than what this product has.All in all though, the mat does its job and protects my leather without scuffs, indentations, or marks, so it's a PLUS purchase recommendation, and far better than any of the competitive products that claim the same function.Overall: Recommended"
180278,0,"this is like the one the hospital gave me. i wish i had started out by renting the hospital grade pump. that way it is less time consuming, you empty your breast completely and pain free."
53213,1,"I think the Soothing Motions Glider is a great product. My 6 week old daughter loves it, and she has slept many hours in it so far. It is very soothing to her. However, there doesn't seem to be much difference in the two speeds, and the noise can get a bit annoying. I can't say much for the music - I wish it was a bit more soothing for her. Regardless, she seems to love it. We have to put it on our coffee table so that our dog doesn't lick her to pieces ;) It's a very stable product."
107447,0,"I purchased this item at BabyrUs for $39.99. I was sold on the price and it is very user friendly. My baby seems to be comfortable in it. However I have to return after 1 day usage, because my back was killing me. We walk about 5 miles every other day at the park and it is getting really hot for both my baby and I.Unfortunately I have to trade this in for an Babybjorn Synergy carrier. The price was kinda high $128, but now we can use it every day ...Just carry my baby around at the house or going for a long hike. I love it and it is good money spent for a baby items ever."
32979,2,"The item I received did not look like/was not the item I looked at on-line and thought I purchased. The wedge I was shown on-line looked like it would work for my stage 2 convertible car seat that is now rear facing, but will soon be forward facing. I purchased the wedge to help stable it up. The wedge I received looked nothing like the one previewed and does not work with the convertible car seat. It will work wonderful for an infant/newborn car seat, but not the convertible."
136227,0,"This toy is just okay. I may feel differently when my baby gets a little bit older, but right now, she doesn't stay in it for longer than 10 minutes or so. She's 4 months old right now. She can't really sit upright so she ends up leaning forward a little bit.Update (3/13/06) She really likes it now--she will stay in it long enough for me to give the kitchen floor a good wash. She has tried all the toys, and is still learning how to play with some of them. But she seems to have a lot of fun trying! This product definitely deserves 4 stars!"
151098,2,I NEVER REALLY COULD GET COMFORTABLE WITH THIS THIS SLING. I THINK MY DAUGHTER IS TOO SMALL. WITH ALL THE FABRIC IT JUST SEEMS AWKWARD. MUCH PREFER THE FRONT CARRIER.
2687,0,Little twig powder has a better rating from Envirornmental Working Group. I like to put this on babys creases in summer.
69403,1,"This is an exellent buy, i have bought before and its worth it would highly recomend."
41773,1,"This monitor is great, it picks up everything and has a great range!"
112112,0,"We are in the midst of potty training now, and lately I have noticed that when my toddler ""holds"" his pee for a while, and runs around in these diapers, the little beads inside that form the gel when wet, tend to crunch together while still dry, and irritate him. I am going with the pull-on diapers instead, in combination with cloth diapers. No point in trying to encourage potty training if a dry diaper is irritating!"
152664,1,These work great on the cosleeper I have and I love how it doesnt have velcro the one that comes with the cosleeper has velcro and sticks to everything in the wash.
10240,1,The curve fits little kid's bottom well. Kids can put the seat on and off by themselves. Works well with boys and girls.
49168,0,"The gate is very well made, but my one complaint is that there is no ""door"" entry. In order to open this gate, you must ""unlock"" two panels and it is VERY difficult to do. Sometimes it takes me 5 or more minutes to figure it out. If you plan on lifting your child or dog in and out, I highly recommend this gate, but if not I'd recommend a gate with a ""door""."
112294,2,"They changed the design of the Cruisers diapers. We used to buy Pampers Baby-Dry diapers for day use and Cruisers for night use. The Baby-Dry diapers couldn't hold in the wetness all night long but worked great for day use and were cheaper than the Cruisers. Now the new Cruisers can no longer hold in the wetness all night either. We no longer see the advantage of buying the Cruisers over the Baby-Dry diapers. We haven't experienced the diaper rash issue that others have. We'll continue to buy the Baby-Dry diapers for now, but we won't buy the Cruisers anymore. I don't know why companies feel the need to mess with a great product. I'm sure it was another bad marketing department decision. They always have to change things to make themselves appear useful..."
128045,1,"This stroller is very light weight, easy to assemble and adorable. My daughter loves the cup holder, and I like the pockets at the top. It also fold up relatively small, so it's easy to fit in the trunk or back of the SUV. My only complaints are that it is tricky to collapse, and the bottom basket could be a bit larger."
183100,1,"I purchased this with the Max Green sculpting gel hoping that one of the products would work to give some life and body to my long, fine textured, thick hair. What a surprise when I found that they're both great. I use the sculpting gel on my wet hair after a shampoo and I use this to scrunch my dry hair. I apply it to the roots and brush it through and then I start scrunching (wadding handfuls of hair). Depending on how much I use I can get a wet look or just a soft wavy look. This adds the body and shine I've been wanting. No more gunky, stuck together hair. The big bonus is that it's safe and healthy. YEA Max Green."
52952,0,I had an average baby (8lbs 2oz) and he didn't fit at all until he was around at least 2m maybe longer. We had to put a blanket under him so he would fit for the longest time. He still enjoyed it. He is a spit-up baby and some nights he would only sleep in that chair with me sleeping next to him. :)One con for it is that is doesn't bounce. He is very active and likes to kick his feet. I was drawn to how comfy it looked. I didn't even think about it not being able to bounce. He got bored with it very quickly ounce he actually fit in it.
112012,1,"I have 19 month twins and ever since they were born I have been searching for the perfect diaper bag. I had the Ju Ju Be Prepared when they were first born, but once we got past needing 6 bottles every time we left the house, and a million outfits, it was just too large. Brilliant bag, and I would recommend to any multiple Mom for the first six months or so. But ever since I have been searching for our next diaper bag. So many others were too small for twins. I'm also a organizational freak, I keep everything very neat and organized. I like to travel light, but at the same time be prepared for anything. Would have loved the JuJu BFF, but far too small, even for a singleton if you like to be prepared. And the Be All has that stupid flap for a Mommy Pocket. I ended up with the Be Mighty, which is great value, and worked for a while when I could attach it to the stroller, but once the girls were toddling and I wasn't using a stroller to get them from a to b it was just annoying, slipped off my shoulder constantly. Will still use it for swimming trips, spare clothes in the car etc, but just not as our every day diaper bag.This doesn't have a Mommy pocket, or many compartments inside, but it is fantastic quality, looks completely gorgeous, and is a brilliant size. I just have everything inside it in different color wet bags/pockets etc, and it stays organized brilliantly. The pockets on the end are too small for bottle's, sippy cups, but great for keys, lip balm, band aids, toddler snacks etc. I was very pleased by the quality of the bottle holder that comes with it, as well as the wet bag. The &#34;hot pink&#34; corduroy isn't too bright, much nicer color than I was expecting - chose that one because I got it for $23 dollars as a warehouse deal. Wasn't expecting to like it so much, the quality is just fantastic, would have paid $100. Really like the thick long strap. Now that my twins are toddlers I needed a bag that I could sling over my shoulder and wear messenger style while I take a toddler by each hand. I did consider a back pack for a while, but I needed to be able to continue wearing the bag and still access what was inside, while keeping toddlers close, so messenger style it was.Has stroller straps included with the bag, they are sewn into the bag and tuck neatly inside. Doubt we'll use them, but love that they are included."
153396,1,"Definitely recommend this stroller. It has everything a parent needs in a stroller for a newborn as well as a toddler. I actually purchased this stroller 3 weeks after I bought their Indie 09 Twin model, which I love! I felt so spoiled by my new double stroller so I wanted to invest in their single strollers. I chose the Flyer 08 model for the reversible handles and b/c it came with the adapter bar and foot muff. The other difference between 08 and 09 is that the wheels on 09 are slightly larger (not a big deal to me). Anyway, I love the reversible handlebars, the large canopy, and the large underneath storage bag - these are the 3 very important aspects of a stroller to me. Of course it's very safe especially when the car seat is in - very stable and secure! My 3 yr old daughter also fits in it perfectly. My previous single stroller was the Peg Perego p3, which is great for its very compact fold, lightweight, safety, easy handling. However, it does not have the flat recline, the large basket, reversible handlebars, nice style, and adjustable handles and footrests."
9422,1,"My son is 30 months old and I was trying to train him on the big potty with the ring insert with no luck at all, he hated it. So I read all the potty reviews and this potty stood out as being the best, and it is!!! My son is a big boy and he fits on it perfectly. The pee guard works very well, so far no spray over. He loves sitting on it so much that he does it all the time. He will even pee when he barely has to, and it's super easy to clean. My son was completely trained after just 2 days, it was amazing, I never thought it would be this easy! There are a lot of cutesy character potties out there that talk to your child and come with all kinds of bells and whistles, but this simple design ensures that your child will use it as it was intended and not think it's just another toy to be played with. I highly recommend this potty!!!!! *****"
67207,1,This is a really nice foot stool. I really like the adjustable angles and it looks really good in a room with hardwood floors.
153276,2,"I would have given this 0 stars if that had been possible. I purchased this clock for my 5 year old granddaughter. However, problems with it caused me to change my mind. Problem one: The clock arrived with hands loose, and falling off. When I got that problem fixed, I noticed Problem 2: The numbers were badly tilted. The photo of the clock when I ordered it showed the clock hanging in a tilted position, but in reality, the clock hangs in the position shown in my photos. This would make it very confusing for children learning to tell time. Neither is it a good time piece for adults. I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews I read before I ordered it."
183584,2,"Being a new mom (b/g twins), I wanted nothing but the best for my babies. We chose the Graco Colby and Graco Harmony highchairs. Loved the idea of being able to recline the seats. We have purchased a lot a products (double everything!) from Graco; by far I do not think these highchairs are worth the price that Graco is asking for them. The ""one-handed"" recline seat is more like two or three handed!! The wheels don't roll all that well, it's more like dragging the highchair across the floor!! The tray does not go close enough to the babies either. I have been pleased with everything else from Graco. I think they need to go back to the design studio and reengineer all of the ""one-handed"" features. If I had it to do all over again I would purchase two Fisher-Price highchairs instead of these two from Graco!! One good feature is the 3 or 5 point harness system (the release button is the only one-handed feature that actually works)."
62449,1,"My girl love it, since she was a baby she has been seen the pictures and the family pics many times , now that she's 3 years old she identified her when she was a baby and me or her grandpa or grandma, etc."
176450,1,"Five years ago, I nursed my son and when I returned to work, I needed a pump that was small and portable for pumping at work. Initially, I used an Avent pump but could never get enough milk and it took a long time. I switched to this pump and it worked great! I never had a problem getting enough milk and it didn't take any longer than I expected. Unfortunately, I got rid of the pump thinking that I'd never need it again. Well, five and half years later I find myself pregnant again and have added this pump to my registry so I'll get it again! Worth the money, light weight, portable and does the job!"
63553,1,I bought the monkey mirror. It's perfect for the back of my car. I can see my son in his car seat perfectly. The mirror is clear.
39856,1,"I have had one of these sound machines for over 10 years and LOVE IT!. It's not for a baby, it's for me. I cannot sleep without it. I live in a condo complex and the street and my neighbors driveway is right below my master bedroom window. This is the only way I can block out the street noise. It has been shutting off occasionally though(after 10+ years) and I was afraid I would not find another and would never get a sound nights sleep again."
111359,2,"This is a great way to prevent your kids from sticking something in the socket. Unfortunately, it will also prevent you from sticking anything in the socket when you want to use the outlet. These things are almost impossible to remove. They have a hook on them that locks into the ground hole of the outlet. The way they are made, the hook does not disengage well enough when pressing the right combinations of buttons, so the plug becomes permanently locked into the socket. It took me 15 minutes to remove the one that I inserted, and I had to resort to the toolbox to get it out. Save your money, get something else."
123701,1,"This is a great for play. I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However, I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep. Unfortunately, the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets (must be purchased from company other than Graco) cause the pad to be a little lumpy. My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it, it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do. I am happy with it."
99771,1,"Dear curious buyer,I am going to tell you my description of what i think about the LUVS diapers with ultra leakguards vs the PAMPERS baby dry. My son, who is now 2 months old, is alittle small for his age. he still fits into size 1 diapers comfortably. There is no difference between pampers and luvs when it comes to holding in the urine - BUT when it comes time for my little baby to make a little poo-poo, it ends up becoming a mudslide (pardon the graphics) with LUVS, yet pampers holds all of it in the diaper. Not only that, I noticed that after two weeks using exclusivley LUVS, my baby developed red areas all over his toosh and pelvic areas. When I made the switch to Pampers, those marks gently faded away (about three days later). Needless to say, I sent the complaint to LUVS and they are in the proccess of refunding me for the purchase (they have a money back guarantee). But I got stuck with over 100 unused diapers that I wouldn't give away (just because i would feel bad for the person I gave it to, and i don't want to cause anyone else's child to have a rash, or even worse - a mudslide episode while shopping at Babys R us!) Therefore, before you buy a large economy pack of diapers, if you're considering any other brand of diapers, spend the extra dollar or two and buy the pampers brand. Trust me, with PAMPERS, you can't go wrong."
22917,2,This thing was too long. It wasn't what i expected. I lost my money. Can't even used it and cannot returned it because I already put the receipt in the garbage. What a waste!!!!!!!
86318,2,"The video quality on the monitor is great. Both the day and night functions are crystal clear. However, this device gets WAY too much interference. I don't know if it's from our WIFI or other electronic devices in our house but its HORRIBLE. We can't use the sound because the static drives us crazy hearing it, but if we turn off the sound then we can't hear when the baby wakes up. We've tried both channels and it doesn't matter. They both have bad interference. I would not recommend this monitor if you have WIFI in your house. Also, I don't like that the monitor screen goes into ""Sleep"" mode after only a few minutes if it's not plugged in. It makes doing chores around the house while she's sleeping very difficult."
66929,1,"The items in this set work great with my pump but I was not aware that the set came with one piece flanges that were already attached to the Y-Shaped base piece that connects to the bottle and hose. If you require a smaller or larger sized flange or already own other sizes, know that you will not be able to use the flanges inserted into the Y-shaped base as it is already connected as one piece. I believe my set came with a built-in size 24 flange."
52994,2,"I received this as a shower gift. We thought it was the coolest thing. We were very wrong. We tried it with my daughter when she was just a few weeks old, and she didn't like it. We thought maybe she was too young for it, and tried back several times throughout the next few months. She is now 4 mos. old and still doesn't like it. She gets bored when she sits in it, the music is not very interesting and apparently the soothing vibrations are not very soothing. When we turn on the vibrations she gets a very uncomfortable look on her face and then starts crying (which she never cries). My advice would be to get a bouncy seat with an entertainment bar or a rocking bouncy seat."
22727,1,"I bought this portable crib for my 3 month old neice for when she comes to visit. It was so easy to set up and I love the toy/mobile bar. I also love the bassinet/changing table feature. Even though the crib is blue, I have bright pink blankets inside and looks just great for a little girl. This is an excellent value for the money and can easily be transported for traveling. Highly recommended!!!"
1730,1,"I knew this deal from my sister. It's really a great price. I like it.We've been using ""Pampers"" since she was born. I've tried other brands, but she doesn't like them as much.we love pampers!!"
184573,1,When my daughter was crawling and walking- I used to think that she wouldn't last through the week with how many times she fell. This saved her from bumping her head seriously on the wooden coffee table that we had. Food does get caught up under the plastic and moisture can get trapped if not properly cleaned. I would recommend getting the larger size if you have a table that is near the limits of the bumper specifications. It runs small.
109886,1,"Bought this to have at my house for my grandson sleeping in a big bed. It was somewhat difficult to put on, just because I hooked it under the mattress, then realized I had to lift the whole mattress up and put the strap through to the other side. It works very well. I love the way it folds and doesn't have to be removed from the bed. It did seem that it doesn't fit tightly on the other side of the bed where you pull to make it tight, but there have been no problems with it. It attaches well enough anyway. Basically need two people to put it on though because of the mattress issue."
128924,1,This spoon has really helped my toddler learn to feed himself. The food stays on the spoon better & it's easier for him to grip the handle.Highly recommend!
17500,0,"We bought this chair because it had a great color scheme and seemed like a really nice chair in the store. The tray sits way to high and my 9 month old has figured out how to remove the removable tray. It says ""machine washable"" but it starts to fall apart after the second wash. It is not easily wiped down and the cover is a pain to remove. Also,the tray does not slide on and off very easily. I wish I would have picked the aquarium high chair instead."
120682,0,"I have to echo the sentiment of others that these are wonderful burp cloths and emergency changing pads, however, they are not thick enough to be used as true cloth diapers instead of disposables. The softness of the cotton makes them ideal for use under baby's head or bottom during changing or feeding time."
172185,1,"We also bought this before our son was born who is now 5months old. I liked that it had the sling for when he was littler, we used it till about 2-1/2 months. It worked great supporting him. Its very slip resistant and I like that it has a built in water temperature gauge (even though what it says is a safe temp, seems quite chilly when I test it) and a spot for the shampoo and whatever else we need during bath time so it's all just right there. Our son loves to splash in the water. He's loved the bath since his first try at 5-days old. I highly recommend it!"
55900,0,"This warmer works fine for me. However, it took some experimenting with the water level to find the right amount. Be sure to have a marker handy because the numbers wiped off in a week (they didn't help at all anyway, so just as well). The warmer seems to work better with my 8 oz bottles than it did with the 4 oz. Every once in a while we have a bottle that's too warm or too cool, but it works the majority of the time."
3763,1,"between two cars and daycare, this has made it a lot easier. one carseat and 3 bases and we don't have to stress about moving her around or the seat being not strapped in properly due to moving it."
28400,1,This is a quality product at a great price. My daughter-in-law loves this new rocker/glider for his new baby.
103446,1,"I got this gate for our triplets when they were about 13months old. They were moving around and we needed to block off an area for them. I wanted a mounted gate because we had an old pressure mounted one that they could push down (all 3 together) and didn't want to have to worry about that. They are now 21 months old and the knob that you turn to open the gate has locked up. I went to their website and sent off an email about this problem since the gate is less than a year old. They are going to send me a prepaid package to send the gate to them and they will send a replacement once they receive it. The only problem I have with this is that I will be without a gate until I get the replacement. I do not want to go and purchase another one since I will be getting a replacement. But at least they are going to replace it. The area where the gate is is a high traffic area, so maybe they are not designed for high traffic areas as one of the other reviews says. But do know if you have problems send them an email before replacing it yourself. Maybe if they get enough emails about the problem they will fix it."
136208,2,"Whenever I close to this thing, there is foul smelling (almost poopoo smell). Finally I found out it was from the flower rattle. This flower also bleeds dye when wet with horrible smell. I have no idea what kind of the fabric that they used for this toy, but awful!!"
182726,1,"great for the toddler on the go.......stays dry for a reasonable amount of time.......no leaks, no hassles........."
104588,1,"I have owned one for 6 years. I am only 5'2"", so I originally bought the full size Snoogle when I was pregnant. It was too big for me. I bought this - perfect! I used it for 3 pregnancies and I slept great with it. It also works well for breastfeeding - you can wrap it around your back and lay the baby across the part in front of your belly.A friend was visiting when my 3rd child was about 2 months old. He was fidgeting so she curled up my Lil Snoogle into a circle and propped him up on it. He fell asleep so quickly! For the next 2-3 months, I gave him tummy time on it (put his chest on it and arms over it), he laid on it on his back propped up in the circle and watched tv and napped, and sometimes he just snuggled with it.I'd recommend it to anyone! And, for other shorter moms-to-be - FABULOUS!!!!"
173590,1,"The reason I chose this swing over a less expensive model was the color scheme. It matches my living room. With all the baby stuff a person ends up with in the house, it's nice to have one of the biggest items not be so gaudy.We've used it from the day our son came home from the hospital and it is so soothing for him. At first, he would just go to sleep in it. The chair is really comfy. Now he's almost 2 months old and really likes the mirror and mobile.The sounds on this swing are really pleasant, even for adults! You can adjust the volume too. Some other reviews complain that it shuts off after a few minutes....understand that only the music and mobile shut off, the swing does not stop. Personally I like that feature because when the music stops, it reminds me to check on my son. Usually I find him asleep, but if not, it's time for something new anyway. The motor is really quiet too.It's also nice to be able to have it swing in 2 directions. If one doesn't soothe the baby, the other one will. (we use both, depending on baby's mood)We use this swing every day and I have not needed to change the batteries yet.Another great product Fisher Price! Way to go!"
140365,0,"We bought this swing because my one-month-old son will not let us put him down and, happily, he seems to like it! Even if he's fussing when we put him in it, it takes under a minute for the swing to soothe away his fussiness and then he falls asleep. In fact, he can't seem to stay awake for long in this swing so we have to take him out at times or he'd sleep in here all day. I like that it rocks the baby two ways because, as it happens, he prefers to be rocked side to side as opposed to front to back like most other swings. I also like the padding in the swing. It looks like he's very comfortable, and the fact that he sleeps so well in here confirms that it is comfortable for him. Overall, our family is satisfied with this purchase because it does what we wanted it to do--allow us to put our baby down for a while so we can get things done around the house or for ourselves.Despite my overall satisfaction, there are a few things that I'd change having to do with the loudness of its features. The motor that moves the cradle/seat makes a monotonous swishing/rocking sound that, though I can stand it, I'd prefer it not to make or to make a little more softly. I also think the music is loud. My son does not seem to mind it. He falls asleep to the music and sleeps through it, but that's what babies generally can do--sleep through lots of noise. The lowest setting on the music is enough to cause me to have to leave the room when I have a call or makes my 8-year-old want to turn up the t.v. when he's watching it, etc. Because it's so loud we compensate by turning it off whenever my son is asleep or quiet and turn it on only when absolutely necessary. The mobile is also loud. It was one of the things I liked most about the swing when I saw it online, but it's the one thing I can't stand about the swing now. My son does look at it moving sometimes, but it makes some kind of mehanical turning sound that irritates me so I've only turned it on about three times now. It sounds almost as if it's about to give out, but because it's brand new I hope that's not the case.That's my take on it. I'm satisified with it for now and would label this a good buy if you won't mind the noise from it."
168449,1,I am a huge fan of Amazon Mom and the Subscribe and Save program!! I can get Pampers for my son for the same price or less than the generic diapers!!!
152680,1,"This netting fits well over the double stroller. Just tuck in the bottom and go! We could not stroll the twins as mosquitos attacked them before this. It has been a lifesaver, enabling us to get them outside. I highly recommend this for outside strolling."
139251,1,We really wanted to purchase this last year but with the limited reviews and people saying you really had to have low ceilings we decided not to purchase it because we have vaulted ceilings. This year we decided to give it a try and just return it if it was blurry or didn't work on the high ceilings. We just opened it tonight and it works great even on very high vaulted ceilings. See pictures that we uploaded.
138444,0,Very happy with this toy when it works with any AAA batteries.The company who's making this toy found a very clever way of forcing you to buy only the battery brand that they like. They did that by designing the battery compartment in such way that any normal battery won't make contact with the positive terminals because of a plastic piece that prevents the contact. That made me wonder... design flaw or marketing startegy?Since I already had a stock of Duracell and rechargeable AAA batteries I had to find a workaround to make them work in this nice toy to keep my kid happy and stick it to the man at the same time. I used some folded aluminum foil that I stuck between the positive terminals of each battery and the metal contacts to fill that gap and close the circuit. Nice to see bright lights again.... :)
183938,2,"I was once an Avid believer and buyer of Luvs Diapers @ Amazon they have the best deals, plus free shipping.What more could you want?! Well I am dissappointed to say the first two boxes of Luvs I recieved were the unfinished,factory bleaced... still smelled like burnt out tree bark or some type of smoke.and Plastic...Absolutely NO Baby Scent to be found.So I called Luvs first in dibelief.Then I started searching for Amazon number which is not the easiest to find.Amazon is refundig me my money and the customer service was very helpful once I reached them.Unfortunately I will not be buying LUVS from Amazon any more but I will be switching to Pampers or buying diapers at a local store.Hope this was helpful"
34483,1,My 5 month old will only take a soothie pacifier. I love these cute little animals. Makes it easier to keep track of her bink on the go.
126440,1,"We use these diapers in combination with the huggies pure and natural. We started with the pampers swaddlers which are great, until my son's BMs started going up the back of the diaper. That's when we switched over to huggies because we love the elastic in the back. It has kept many ""near misses"" at bay. I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 because they are not as soft as the huggies pure and natural or pampers. We won't put our son in these overnight, because he will get occasional chaffing from the edges. We try to alternate with the softer pure and natural diapers during the day so there's never any chaffing. Once I did find a plastic thread sticking out of the diaper. They are less expensive than the other huggies diapers, so good product for the cost, although it's not as convenient keeping 2 stacks of different diapers around (since we use another diaper for night time)."
39537,1,We went from a swaddle blanket to these sleep sacks. My daughter loves them. She still doesn't know how to use a blanket but doesn't need one with the sleep sack. I can't find XL in the stores - only online. I don't know what to do when she outgrows the XL....
60143,1,"We've been using this since birth for the past 4 months and it's working well. I don't really have a comparison point but no complaints. The back seems a little slippery so we put an organic cotton diaper on it as a little pad to make things more comfortable. There is plenty of room and I think we'll begin to love this more once she is old enough to sit up. For now, we get through bath without any tears or falls and that is good enough for me!"
165529,2,Do not buy diapers from Amazon. Your order will likely not ship unti lafter a couple of months or one fine day you will discover that your order has been cancelled because they ran out of stock. Not only that if your original order had multiple items on it and had qualified for free shipping they will charge you the shipping amount even though they are unable to fulfil this part of your order. I have voiced this concern strongly to CS and believe this is a false business practice they are following. If I were you I'd stay away from diaper shopping at Amazon.
3611,1,The car seat is very roomy for a growing child and was easy to install. She seems to be very comfortable in it for the short distances that I usually take her. It was a great price and was delivered faster than I expected.
2550,2,"We tried a bunch of different diapers for our 2 month old. Huggies Natural, Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry, other Huggies and by far the most leaky diapers were Baby Dry. #1 and #2 never stayed in the diaper! Right out the sides and back and all over me...almost every time. Also, the absorbent core stuff would come out and stick to our baby's skin. Swaddlers are absolutely fabulous and we'll stick with those."
75835,1,"We bought two, one for each carseat in our two cars. They fit well and we haven't had a problem with it sliding down. It has protected our car's leather fine. I haven't checked to see if the seats leave indentations in our leather seats, but it wouldn't matter anyway. I rather our car seats be firmly secured and leave indentations, then not."
171120,1,"My daughter loves this puppy, she got it for Christmas. It is really cute and soft, I just wish it was a little bigger for her. It is 24 inches long. Other than that, its a great little puppy friend."
174262,0,"The dimensions listed in the description are incorrect and unhelpful. Reading the reviews that this cover fits the Graco Pack n'Play, I went to an external website and found more information that listed the dimensions as 27"" x 37."" Maybe this will help others who are interested in purchasing this item."
19281,1,"I wish I had bought this much sooner! I got it when my son was 1 month old and what a difference it made for him in his car seat! The whole first month of his life I hated seeing my baby slumped into a little ball. I wasted money on other head supports that didn't do nearly as good a job and then I found the Snuzzler Infant Support. It makes him look much more comfortable. And I don't think it's unsafe like another reviewer wrote...the padding is all on the side. There is just a thin bit of material behind baby, but what's the difference between that and the baby wearing an extra layer(shirt)? I highly recommend this item!"
50481,1,"somewhere around week 22 of prego, my wife's back and hips start to get really sore, and she was having trouble sleeping. The snoogle came to the rescue. help level her hips at night, which made her back muscles much happier."
155173,1,"My daughter loved these peel and stick horse decor. She is 8 and was able to put them up herself, they also have great detail, very life like."
82164,1,This monitor works great in our two story home. The only issue I have is that I wish you could turn the volume down even a little lower! I love being able to use either the battery or plug it in and they are very lightweight.
103760,1,just what i needed for wife to add to her medela pump kit. best when used with the soft shield that the connector ataches to.
78507,1,"I bought this pump when my daughter was three months old. Upon using it at work, I realized that my milk supply was SERIOUSLY dwindling and I couldn't figure out why. I pumped three or four times per day at work, and could only get three to four ounces of milk per pumping session, on a good day! Talk about stressing me out!I talked to a lactation consultant who explained to me that this pump isn't good for frequent pumpers, because IT ONLY PUMPS ONE SIDE AT A TIME. Yes, it is a DOUBLE electric, but the suction alternates one side and then the other. This means that in a ten minute pumping session, each breast only gets five minutes worth of pumping time. This obviously results in much less suction time than you would spend nursing, thus the reduction in your milk supply. Since I already had low supply, this pump almost ended my nursing!So steer clear of this pump and purchase the advanced pump in style if you plan to do any kind of long term pumping, like at work, for extended periods of time, or if you have to increase your supply. There is a reason that the advanced pump in style costs more: It works 100% better, is more sturdy, quieter, reliable, and will keep up your supply.This double electric pump is awkward at best, and I would spill my milk bottles and get milk into the tubing all the time. With that kind of stress, it's hard to relax for the let down. Also, the suction was really painful to my nipples.I'm glad that some people have had good results with this pump, but it totally did not work for me. As a matter of fact, mylactation consultant told me that she wouldn't recommend this pump for anyone. Too many problems, when the advanced works beautifully.Trust me, spend the money one time on the better pump; it's worth it!"
79881,1,"I really like this product. It helps to keep the liquid cold longer and my hands warm when drinking. I order this for a 27oz. bottle and while it doesn't cover the neck of the bottle, it covers the rest of it which is fine with me. My one complaint, and I don't know if this amazon's fault or the company, but the colors for the Soho Stripe are not as pictured. They really aren't even close, so it is not a problem with my monitor. The pattern is the same, but the colors are closer to Stripe No. 7 tote. Personally, I like these colors better and I'm not that picky, but I think people should be aware. This is why I gave the product 4 stars."
69610,0,This is a fairly well constructed play yard and it is much larger than we expected which was a nice surprise. It looks just as pictured and is sturdy. Our only complaint is that it is noisy. When we laid our 4 month old down in it to sleep while on vacation it made loud crinkling sounds every time she moved and therefore scared her and made her cry. She would/could not sleep in it because of the loud sounds. We thankfully had another play yard with us and had our 2 year old sleep in this one instead and she went to sleep with no problems.
52898,0,"While this is a great place for the baby to sleep or be seated...there is no entertainment value for this bouncer. I had to go out and purchase an additional bouncer chair that has a toy bar for him. He likes to sleep in the bouncer but that is about it. On a positive note, it is easy to clean."
170323,1,"My Daughter is 6 months old, and only 12lbs, but my brother was having a baby so I we gave them our infant seat, and bought this one. I was not sure how she would do in such a big car seat, for such a little girl, but she loves it. It has more room, and a lot more confortable for her. She loves the extra room. It is easy to put in the car, and is easy to strap my daughter in. I know that this car seat was a little more than some others but I think that it was worth it. Plus I love the color, and it is easy to wash."
102709,1,I love this! It made traveling ALONE with my two year old so easy!!!! I had so many people stop me in the airport to ask about it! And I couldn't have given everyone a more positive review of the carrier. Again I LOVE this and I would tell anyone traveling with children to get one.
154352,1,I love these wipes. I love that they are thick and clean up well. I also love that they are chlorine free. I don't actually have the hard plastic container I just use these packages as is and I love how easy it is to pull each sheet out. The individual sheets dont stick together!
172737,2,This tub is horrible if your baby is tall. My baby at six weeks old was kicking from the bottom and would hit his head on the top. He is too young to sit up yet so I had to go and buy a tub on an angle so he wouldn't hit his head. He was 21 inches when he was born. I used this tub twice and the sprayer stopped working.
160239,1,"This is the perfect gift for winter/cold weather newborns. My daughter loved being wrapped up and feeling all snugly, and even after she got too long for it, I simply attached the velcro under her arms so that her stomach and legs would have that extra layer of warmth. Also, she's a master of kicking off her blankets if her legs aren't tied up, so this swaddle blanket has been going strong for 4 months now!"
174206,1,"My 5 week old son likes this swing. He watches the mobile and is entertained by the music. I personally do not like a lot of the other sounds that you can set it on (the chirping mainly) but the sound of water running is also calming. This swing is extremely soft and cuddly and seems to be very comfy for my baby. Although, I have always heard people that are thankful for their swings so their babies would sleep and my son will sleep in his swing but not for too long. It is great that it can swing from side to side or front to back also, but I do wish that you could turn it in either direction for it to swing front to back. I don't get to use that option because of where the swing is in our house. Overall, this is a great purchase. I don't know if it is necessarily worth the money, but still a nice swing.UPDATE: As my son has gotten older (now 9 weeks), he likes the swing even more. He loves the mobile and the rocking does put him to sleep or, if he is awake, keeps him entertained. Definitely a great swing! However, don't bother with the matching bouncy seat. What a waste!"
56781,1,"This is a great potty chair. Very sturdy, and easy to clean. There is a splash guard, which can be turned to the back if it makes your child uncomfortable. I have twins, a boy and a girl, and this was just great for us. We had two chairs in one bathroom (they love to share the experience!), and the chairs can even be stacked to take up less room when not being used."
174857,1,"This nursery care kit is great! Before buying another care kit consider the following points, with the time and frustration you will save... you'll be glad you did. The first week home from the hospital I used the nasal aspirator countless times. It is very gentle but very effective. The digital thermometer is quick and easy to use. So much better than the glass and mercury kind. The medicine spoon and dropper are very clearly marked so you know exactly how much you are giving your baby. The nail clippers are curved so they can cut better with less chance of cutting your baby's finger. Anyone that has ever cut their baby's finger while trimming their nails will appreciate that! The items in this kit are small and compact and very easy to store. Great to keep in your diaper bag for when you're on the go."
108108,2,I bought this pump after reading glowing reviews. I had been using a pump-in-style (my son was premature so I needed the big guns) once he was older I thought I could go to a manual pump it seemed like it would be easier to use for a quick pump before I left him home with dad for a few hours. I really gave it a long trial- two months but really did not find that I could get more than a few ounces out at a time. It was uncomfortable on my breats even pinched and rubbed a blister once. Finally I just gave up on pumping all together. If you are lucky enough to have an electric double pump don't think the grass is greener elsewhere. It wasn't for me.
88829,1,the best diapers ever!!!! i use them with my first baby and they are the most amazing never had any liking or rash on the kids body
132867,0,Received from our baby shower. Wanted the Dekor after reading reviews about how much better this diaper pail system was than Champ or Genie. My husband and I were both disappointed with the quality of plastic...one of the two plastic flaps that cover the dirty diaper area broke after the second use. You can definitely smell dirty diapers (probably b/c broken flap but maybe not). Husband went right out and bought a Diaper Champ the next day because of the smell...the first thing that he bought for the baby. Love the Champ b/c you don't smell anything and don't need special bags.
108410,1,"I'll start with my one complaint... When my son sits on the seat too long, and he's a light 27lbs, he'll have marks on his hiney from where the seat cushion doesn't adequately protect the frame of the seat. He doesn't complain about it being uncomfortable but it doesn't look good. I wondered if it was a defect but a friend has the same problem. Now as for my absolute like of this seat... The Cup guard for urine is tall and wide, but the tall part is key. Most seats in the store have shallow and wide cups and my son pees right over them and makes a mess when he sits and pees. But with this seat he never makes a mess! I love this! I also like that at 18 months this seat fit him perfect and now a year later its still fits him, he doesn't fall in and isn't too heavy for it. All and all this is a great seat, just the seat marks is my main complaint!!"
40646,1,"These diapers are now the only ones I'll ever buy. They are very soft, the tabs STAY on, and they move with my 2 year old without coming loose or leaking. Ive tried MANY other diapers and nothing adds up to the quality of these cruisers. The best part is that diaper rashes are way down (my baby has eczema) and there is no rubbing marks on the upper inner thighs like you get from cheep plastic diapers."
57396,0,"I love the way this play yard looks. I have it in the lime green and it really is sporty.Pros: Looks good, very sturdy, light & vibrate features are great, conveneint changing table and bassinet featuresCons: You HAVE to follow the directions. There is only 1 order to set the pnp up (and 1 way to take it down). I actually wrote in marker on mine to remind me because it is easy to forget and I was tired of getting the directions everytime I set it up/took it down. The directions for assembling the bassinet are very unclear...just look at the pictures and trial and error will set it up! The music is loud and funky and once you turn it on, there isn't an off until the song is over, so if you hit the wrong button in the middle of the night, you may wake up a sleeping baby. The pnp and the bassinet are odd sizes, so there are NO sheets available to purchase for them. I made my own.I would not recommend this product. I'm sure there are better pnp's."
109344,1,"I bought this for my 9 month old son who just starting getting his first tooth. I've put a peeled apple, a frozen banana and bread in it so far. He seems to like it, but it doesn't keep him occupied for very long. I think he's just not use to it yet. I love the idea of this and just wish I had it when my first son was a baby. It's really easy to clean too, which is a plus! Would definitely recommend this to anyone!"
91358,2,"We got this monitor as a gift from our baby registry after reading good reviews in books and online. I was very disappointed in the sound quality, as I was unable to eliminate static and interference even by switching channels, and moving the unit around. There was an annoying hum from the unit when it was plugged into the wall, and the baby could hardly be heard when it was in battery mode.Overall, very disappointing, and now I have to go and try other ones."
82816,1,"My sister in law got one of these for my baby who is now two...It has been a constant companion in the car, in her bed - everywhere. I LOVE SLEEP SHEEP! I now buy them for all of my friends having babies."
67307,2,I had my first child and was looking forward to breast feeding but this was the only pump they had at the store and it quit on me. I was so disapointed because I had to take water pills and was unable to breast feed at that time. When the pump failed I dryed up and now cannot breast feed my child.
125192,1,"This is an all around fun teething product. My son loves gnawing on it when his gums are bothering him and I love watching him! The rippled silicone texture is awesome for chewing but be careful, it also has a tendency to pick up any fuzz or lint that comes off blankets, sweaters, teddy bears etc...I find myself having to wash it off every time it leaves his mouth. Aside from that, it's great - we have several!"
176214,1,"These bottles are wonderful especialy for breast fed babies. The wide nipple is perfect, it lets your baby latch on just as if she were on the breast."
107475,1,"I've been using GoSmile for awhile now but, despite the expense and hype, it didn't do a lot. I've been using Supersmile for two weeks and, WOW, what a difference! I just reordered it and will also purchase other Supersmile products. Yes, folks, it works!"
177938,0,"I own all 3 stainless sippy cups - the Kleen Kanteen, the Thermos Foogoo, and the Safe Sippy. Conclusion: each has its specific use that it is best for. I use the Kleen Kanteen for water, the Foogoo for milk (so my daughter knows what drink she is getting). I like Safe Sippy the least.My daughter is 17 months and has been using a sippy cup since 5 months.Kleen Kanteen - 5 stars- my go-to cup and favorite of the threePros:* Easy to assemble and clean (I wash it every day with hot soapy water and a nipple brush to avoid anything growing in the spout)* Takes the Avent spouts* Does NOT leak either from the valve or the threads (note to people who say that it just lets water run out - make sure you put the clear valve on the inside!). Also does not leak when she drops it or shakes it.* You can put a can koozie around it if you need insulation!!!* Lifelong purchase - When they don't need a sippy anymore, switch out the top.Cons:* The black plastic collar that screws in place has broken 4 (Yes! FOUR!) times when my daughter has dropped it. Costs at least $4.50 to replace. Has broken each time on a linoleum floor!* My daughter has dented the bottom by banging it on the concrete outside. (not really a big deal, just aesthetically not as nice anymore)* Mine did not come with a lid.Thermos Foogoo - 3 stars - daily use for milk - great for outings but started leaking after 4 monthsPros:* The thermos construction keeps milk cold for hours!* My daughter has dropped this one (or thrown it) and it does not break and only leaks a little milk from the spout (none from the threads).Cons: Complicated!!! Read the directions!!!* Valve is 2 pieces, difficult to remove, and don't loose either piece!* Lid is 2 pieces, can be difficult to align.* Lid pieces must be aligned perfectly and must be screwed in perfectly (spout exactly 90 degrees from the handles) so that it does not leak from the threads.* My daughter has dented it.Other comments:* When my daughter was younger I liked the smaller volume - a larger size would have been too heavy and my daughter did not drink more than 7 oz of milk at once. Now she drinks more, and a larger cup would be nice. I guess now I just need to take a regular thermos of milk, and a separate sippy cup.* It did not leak from the spout or threads for many months, as long as it was properly assembled, even if it was stored sideways. However, after 4 months of use, it now leaks a bit. If I put it in my bag, I put the cup in a Ziploc first.Safe Sippy - 3 stars - Leaky so I use as a backup cup for water - I like the straw that comes with it (would have rated it 2 stars if there was no straw)Pros:* Handle is removable (Its kind of cheap and gets in the way, might be useful for the youngest kids)* Switch out the inside valve with a straw! This is cool - I taught my daughter how to use the straw, so when she is older we will use this cup more.* Rubber around the outside, so no need for a koozie.Cons: Leaky! Leaky! Leaky!* I wonder if the valve on this thing is just inconsistent between each bottle. Mine leaks when it is upside down and my daughter stops drinking and the pressure equalizes. It also leaks if its upside down and gets shaken at all. Some folks complain that it is too hard to get any water out, and others say it is perfect.* The threads do not leak* The o-ring is hard to get in and out to clean and you must be careful not to break it in the process."
117293,1,"We bought this to keep our two cats out of the Study and it works great. Extremely well made, looks really great and very easy to open and close. If necessary we could put one of our electric scat mats in front of it to keep cats from attempting to jump over. The bars are close enough so they cannot go through that way. Do read the assembly instructions as hardware is provided for three different width door openings."
54929,2,"We bought this playard as a bassinet and second changing station for our soon to be born second daughter. We have another playard in the upstairs of our home by graco that we are using as a changing table. With the Evenflo, my husband and I could not figure out how to put the thing together even with the instruction booklet! Once we got it together, we couldn't get the bottom to lock correctly. We have 4 cats and anytime any of them would get underneath the lock would pop back up. The bassinet looked like it could be a safety hazard, even a small amount of weight in it would cause it to sag in the middle. The matteress was very soft, which worried me about suffocation problems with the sagging. We promptly returned the item the next day and bought a graco (30 dollars more) and didn't have any problem setting it up, never once needed instructions, and the lock worked correctly and the bassinet was MUCH sturdier. Plus it had a mobile and a station to keep diapers and a music center. All in all the evenflo was pretty, but not worth spending $30 less. Buy a graco!"
141107,1,"My daughter loves this, we've had it a year and she still plays with it. this is a good toy for toddlers."
29224,0,"I thought the whole point of this product was to help your toddler reach the toilet when training, but the step was still too low for my two-year old to reach it. It is sturdy but I will need to find something else in the meantime."
109805,1,"It wasn't too hard to put together, but a little bit in getting it to fit accurately. My grand daughter knocked it over. Guess she didn't like sleeping on a bigger bed and wanted to make a statement without saying anything. It is a nice item and large enough, but I have to find a better way for the item to stay on the bed. I purchased two of these and if I needed another, I would get the same thing."
13331,1,"This is a wonderful, wonderful product. It is sturdy and easy to assemble. I use it in tandem with my Boppy and love the results. My two month old and I have had our trials and tribulations with breastfeeding, but this stool has eliminated all of our discomfort. No more back pain and fewer bad latches due to awkward positioning. If you are a breastfeeding mom, you need this stool!"
182069,1,"This stuff is wonderful! It is the ONLY cream that will get rid of my kids' diaper rash. I have tried almost everything else, and this stuff works in one day. It is amazing- beats anything you can buy at the store hands down. Buy it!"
17631,1,"I like this stroller because it's compact and pushes nicely. I love that it reclines! The only thing I don't like is that sometimes I kick the wheels when I'm walking because they're close together, but most umbrella strollers are like that. All in all, it's a great stroller!"
34604,2,"I should have just thrown my money away rather than purchase this product. After only one use, the handle broke. This is a very flimsy product, the suction is terrible, and the only way to get it fixed was to send it away, get it repaired, and send it back. Rather than waste any more time or money on it, I just tossed it and bought one from a different brand."
124566,2,These cups are not worth the money that is being charged. The display pictures make them look much bigger than they are. In fact the smallest cup could be a choking hazard for smaller kids. You are better off buying measuring cups at K-mart for $3.00.
69140,0,"I love these diapers and always buy them from Amazon when they are $7.49. I don't understand why Amazon would charge more per diaper for the ""Value Pack"" than for the regular pack.For a size 4 cruiser sold in the regular 32 count package, one will pay $.234, but in the VALUE pack one will pay $.288. This just doesn't make sense to me."
178982,1,"These bottles work nice and are a good option to try for babies who are having problems with fussiness or gas. They seem to reduce the amount of bubbles and make the feedings easier for our little one. (We also use the Doctor Brown bottles). I haven't noticed a big difference in performance between the two, but these are easier to clean."
24906,1,"I bought the metal gate to keep a 115lb German Shepard contained in a bedroom at times. I wasn't sure it would do the trick, but it keeps her in, and lets her see what is going on outside the room which helps keep her calmer in ""prison"". I was able to install is easily by myself, (yes I am a woman). It is so easy to enter and exit. It is one of the best purchases I have made in a while.B.Bowden"
137310,2,"This pillow will sure keep you sleeping on your left side and provides limited protection from Hubbie's cold feet. But you might lose sleep when it comes time to changing its cover. The distress of threading a 9-ft cloth condom over a U-shaped pillow with widened ends is enough to put you into labour. It's worse than putting ski boots on a squirming child. C'mon Leacho. Technological advancements like buttons, zippers, and velcro were made to rescue us from designs like these."
79231,1,"This is the only diaper cream I will use. I love the way it smells, the way it spreads so easily, and it works beautifully...if my son had a bit of diaper rash, it was gone within a couple of changings while using this. He developed terrible chafing from pooping so much from while on antibiotics and this cleared it right up. I tried the Bordeaux Butt Paste and hated it because it didn't apply as easily as the CB. I'll never use anything else."
42220,2,"This is a long piece of black cloth that people have figured out how to market really well. I am frustrated by companies trying to convince consumers that products like this are ""absolutely essential"".Even after reading the instructions carefully, putting the baby is in difficult at best - with my wife helping me as well. That is when the baby is in a good mood. Imagine putting the baby into the folds when she is already screaming loudly - it only makes the colic worse. Aside from the difficulty of use - after I put the baby in, I did not like the way it stretches and thus bends the baby's back.I can see if the baby is in a good mood and you have a lot of time to put this on - sure it can carry your baby. But I recommend purchasing a standard baby carrier over this any day. They are much easier to use and gives the baby good posture. Just because it seems ""out of the box"" to use a long cloth to carry the baby - does not automatically give the product merit.This is an example of some intelligent marketing people saying ""how can be make consumers believe a long black cloth is a must buy?"". To start off you will see that the box that the moby wrap comes packaged in with is filled with ""awards"". The instruction booklet is very fancy with over smiling parents. Finally they have a high budget website with celebrity endorsements - based on all the 5 star reviews I see all these methods worked great."
39997,1,"I have tried several ""cute"" sound machines for my baby...including the teddy bear one (shuts off in FIVE minutes!!!)and the Sleep Sheep...shuts off in 20 minutes. I needed a ""white noise"" machine..with the 'heart beat"" because THAT is what keeps my baby asleep. This is the ONLY heart-beat machine that has the feature to keep it on permanently! I have used this for naps and at night (my son slept thru the night with this on at 6 weeks...)for 7 months now...it still works great. It is THE BEST!!!"
170432,2,"I ordered the rain canopy for my new double summit 360 baby jogger stroller. After several minutes of trying to fit the plastic cover over the stroller, I re-checked the rain canopy instruction sheet to find that it only fits 2004/2005 stroller models. A huge waste of time, and now I have to wait for the CORRECT canopy to fit current models."
138215,1,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She really likes it and enjoys watching the stars and moon on the ceiling. I just wish it had an option to make it brighter.
164067,1,"This monitor has great sound quality. We love that we can talk to our son to let him know we are on our way. He even goes back to sleep sometimes. The light on it is very bright, but we now use it as a night light in his room. We turn ours into a box to cut the light. The only real negative is that it takes longer than expected to get the beep saying that he can hear what we are saying. It's worth the money, since it gets him to go back to sleep on his own."
147940,1,works well still 2 years and 2 kids later. the only thing is it eats the batteries and they need to be changed too often.
97880,2,"These bottles were only ok for my 4 month old son. I don't know that I noticed a big enough change in him spitting up to make it worth it. There is to many little pieces to take apart and clean after each feeding, it takes enough time to clean normal bottles!!! I suggest if your baby is formula fed to use ENFAMIL LIPIL AR. This has reduced his spit up fits by at least 60%"
109885,2,"I bought this for when we transitioned my daughter from her crib to a twin mattress. I returned it after trying to make it work for a few weeks. No matter what we tried, we could not get the rail to fit snug enough to the bed... there was always a gap. The metal bar that goes across through the middle pushes against the mattress and creates a gap. We always had to stuff the gap with blankets and even then I felt that it was hazardous if my daughter were to get stuck between the mattress and this bed rail. It got to the point that my husband and I both thought that it would be safer for her to fall out of the bed than to get stuck at night inbetween the mattress and bed rail. We returned it and haven't missed it, she did fine with just putting a row of pillows along the edge of the bed... thankful for the free return, but wish I saved myself the trouble and just used pillows in the first place."
143219,1,I have a 3 month old baby and had a 4 day trip coming up (didn't bring the baby). Pumped while abroad and brought the milks back home. These worked well with my evenflo bottles. No leaks!!! (I don't feel comfortable with using storage bags.) Will be using these over and over whenever we travel and especially for future trips abroad without the baby.
61929,0,"They run small and I really dislike the fact that these don't have sides that open. Even though these are cheaper, I'll be going back to the real pull ups."
24486,1,"We bought this gate about 2 1/2 years ago when our 3 year old started getting around. We had a huge gate blocking his way out of our family room and needed a more user friendly gate in the other other entrance into the familyroom/kitchen area. This gate was later moved to blocking our bedroom when he was old enough to move around more of the house.I have LOVED this gate to this day. It was so nice to bring groceries in and not have to climb over the larger gate. I just stepped on the pedal and push the gate open with my knee and I never had to put a thing down to do it. My Three year old cannot get through it so our bedroom is where all the medicines etc are so he cannot get to them.Now, here is the only things I have found wrong with it. When we took it down in the kitchen we did have to patch up the places where the gate squeezes against the doorway, it peeled paint and some plaster. Not a big deal since we had the paint to patch. The other more frustrating thing that we have discovered TODAY is that our 8 mo old is now crawling all over the place and so we have set up the old larger gate and have moved the pedal gate into the kitchen again. BUT again, our 3 year old cannot get through the gate. You can loosen the ends so it is a little easier to open but he still cannot open it himself. I am now desperately looking for a gate that will allow an older sibling to get through but keep the little guy in."
124047,2,"Got one as a gift and now have to return it. It is not as ""universal"" as it states. The only way you can keep a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat from completely falling off is to use a strap that it somes with. The car seat does not lock onto anything, but merely rests on the bar. The problem with having to strap the car seat down is that the strap goes OVER the baby's chubby legs and/or belly. It doesn't leave much room for an infant once you secure the car seat to the stroller."
106687,1,"We refused to buy the Diaper Genie because of the mandatory refill bags-too much money ! The first diaper pail we had was nowhere near as good. The top opened to put the diaper in and you could see right in, ie, smell right in. My toddler could flip the lid and ended up breaking it. We bought the Champ 2 months ago and it paid for itself right away. A little hard to open until you get the hang of it, but other than that, it's great. My toddler even puts her diapers in and I never have to worry about her getting inside the pail. There is NO WAY she can open it. It's wonderful !!! I also buy the kitchen bags from the dollar store and we usually use 2 bags a week. Definitely the best !!!"
90267,1,"I am very pleased. There is not much to say about the diapers---they get the job done just as good as any other Pampers I bought anywhere else. But I got a great deal on them (along with free shipping) thanks to a coupon code. Best of all, I didn't have to get the little one out to go to a store and buy them! A win-win! :)"
34119,2,What an amazing product idea! Too bad the zipper broke within the 1st hour we used it. Not sure if exchanging it will result in a better zipper as it seems poor quality
139647,0,"The item projects a starry night sky onto the walls and ceiling, but to have this sky looks nice the lamp should be in specific position, in the middle of room and not far from ceiling.Cheap plactic,broken easily."
34811,2,"We bought this car seat based not only on the reviews, but on the fact that it seats a child up to 100 lbs, was light weight, and looked good. We were told it was a new and improved model.The LATCH system on this seat does not work! The straps don't even go beyond the base of the car seat much less go down far enough to be attached to the car!We ended up using lap belts only to secure it, however are unhappy with how top heavy and loose it seems. We are having it checked over by the Highway Patrol (they will do this for free in many states) before we decide if it will keep it or not, however I see a return in my future. I should have stuck with the less expensive car seat I KNEW worked that goes up to 40 lbs."
154720,2,"Good value but....they aren't very thick and my baby still reeks a little after I use these. In pinch I'd get these for the price but, you get what you pay for"
148893,1,"This pillow is wonderful! At 22 weeks, I had been sleeping with a regular body pillow, and I just got the Leahco pillow in the mail. I sleep with a normal pillow under my head and the closed part of this pillow at my feet. I had a lot of back pain that didn't let me sleep through the night (or at least wake up rested), but with this pillow I sleep like a log. I can't say anything about durability or long-term use because I haven't had it very long, but so far it's wonderful! So glad I got this."
38044,0,THIS QUILT IS PROBABLY WORTH THE $25 BUT IT ISN'T MADE VERY WELL. DOESN'T HOLD UP IN WASH.
165180,1,Great product and will continue to use this over the Dry Max! I would recommend this product to any mother! Will continue to order this brand until my son grows out of diapers!

37335,1,"I haven't used this yet, but I had read poor reviews about the Baby Jogger travel bag and wanted to try a different one. This one was much cheaper and got better reviews. I got it today and packed up my Baby Jogger City Select stroller with one seat in the bag and it fit with lots of room to spare! I did only have one seat in there, but I'm confident that the second seat would fit. Also, in order to fit it in, I did have to take off the rear wheels. I think that for travel, I will remove the front wheels too, just to avoid potential damage during handling (I'll be flying, and I've heard that baggage handlers are notoriously careless with baggage).The fabric is a canvas - seems pretty sturdy, although I haven't traveled with it yet. There is no padding in the bag either, which is nice because it stores well in a small bag, but padding would add better protection, I suppose.Anyway, I'm happy with this bag so far and I hope it holds up well for travel!Update: I used this bag to fly last month and I'm pretty happy with it. It definitely is not structured like in the picture (it's more floppy, like a thin duffel bag). I didn't have any damage to the bag."
33870,0,"When I first saw this adorable looking (online) crib mobile I was excited. The look was great and the price better. Unfortunately, it arrived in a crushed box and the plastic pieces were just stuffed into the box with out a plastic container. It looked as if someone found it in a warehouse on the floor and shoved it into a box. Just a suggestion to the seller. The product must arrive looking as appealing as it does online. I'm returning it ASAP. Warning...you get what you pay for!Debbie in New Mexico."
160624,1,This is a must have for every nursery! This product has to be one of my favorite baby items. These are durable and will last! 2 is best to have. In the middle of the night who feels like changing sheets if a baby wets or spits up. If you have these all you have to do is unsnap it and put on a new one takes 5 minutes sleepwalking to do. No longer need to take out the matress change the sheets or the matress pad. Makes things so much easier!! From the outside of the crib you can still enjoy the cute pattern of your nursery set it is when you look down into the crib that you see the white. Mine have so far held up through 2 children and still look great. The fabric is a soft cotton that does not pill and the bottom is the waterproof plastic. Before I purchased these I had purchased several fitted sheets for the crib. Because of the Ultimate Crib Sheet I have only needed the 1 fitted sheet all the others are still in the original package! I have given these as gifts for baby showers and everyone loves them once they try it. You won't be disappointed!!
132928,1,"I have the small version of this diaper pail. Diaper Dekor. I love it. I have none of the diaper pail problems my friends or family seem to have with other diaper pails. No leaks and it never smells. I have had it since my daughter was born 14 months ago and I still love it and it's in perfect working condition! It is small so I do empty it twice a week. As the diapers and baby get bigger I have to change it more often. But lets face it guys, really, how long do you want dirty diapers in the house??I wipe it down with disinfectant wipes and spray it once or twice and month. It's great. No tricks or problems operating it. Step on the pedal drop the diaper in...as easy as that! Changing the bag supply is easy too. It even converts to a regular garbage pail when your house becomes a diaper free zone! Ahh...My insert flap broke, I called the company, it was hassle free and the replacement part was at my house three days later. I would buy this product over again. Not sure if they still make the original smaller version I have but it's great. The replacement bags are hard to find for the original small pail. But you can order them online or Buy Buy Baby seems to always have them in stock. Great product."
72609,1,"I absolutely love this cup. I have tried just about every cup with my son. Gerber, Playtex, First Years, Nuby, Thinkbaby, Avent, etc. I like the Thinkbaby cup but it tends to be slightly leaky. The Bornfree trainer cup does not leak at all and my 8 month old has no trouble drinking from it. I wanted a BPA free cup that he could actually drink from and would not leak. I found it! It is so cute when he tips his head all the way back to get a drink, sometimes falling over due to overcompensation. :)"
46060,1,"I wasn't sure about this mobile at first since it doesn't move and it's just a bunch of abstract and simple pictures dangling above the baby, but I needed something to distract my 2 month old daughter at the changing table without having to buy another fancy mobile. At first glance, my baby took to it right away. I don't know why these images attract babies but it does. This has become one of my 2 month old daughter's favorite toy. She loves talking to it...so much so that sometimes I'm reluctant to move her out of the changing table.The stem is made of plastic that comes in two parts which you snap together and once attached you cannot take it apart. The cards are plastic and reminds me a bit of plastic poker cards. Some of the cards have images like a car, house, cat, and dog, but most have abstract images that comes in bold colors or black and white. Taking the cards apart from each other can be tricky and I can see why some people can accidentally rip it apart. I've found that if you fold the cards so they lay flat against each other and then wiggle/twist the area where they are attached they usually slide apart. So the parts are not exactly sturdy and once my baby can reach it, I'll remove it and just use the cards as flash cards.The mobile comes with several sets of cards so you can change the images and the baby won't be bored. However, I just put the images I like on the mobile and use the rest as flash cards when traveling to distract my little girl.For the price and the entertainment it has brought to my baby, I highly recommend this mobile."
179464,1,"My wife and I have 16 month old twins and own two of the newer model Travelmates (QRKIDZ). We fly frequently and the Travelmates have made airline travel so much easier! Use of the Travelmates has also made it possible for my wife to fly solo with our boys, which would otherwise be nearly impossible for her to do. This alone makes these worth the price. Here is her review of the Travelmate:I did a lot of research on the Travelmate and compatible car seats (as well as widths of airplane aisles). The width of most airplane aisles is 17"", and with my Graco ComfortSport car seats (17"" wide), it's possible to simultaneously wheel my boys down the aisle in their seats while attached to the Travelmates. I can then easily remove the Travelmate from their seats and stow them. Anytime I go through security with my twins it's a bit chaotic, but from my experience the Travelmates are more of a help than a hindrance. The Travelmates easily detach from the car seats, or in some cases I can leave them attached to the seats and just remove the wheels. Wheeling around my boys obviously requires both hands, but as long as I just carry a backpack I can maneuver airports and airplane aisles with no problems. When first using the Travelmate I did experience some difficulty with a wheel falling off, but later discovered I did not attach it properly. I also found it a bit tricky to attach to the car seat, but after subsequent use I've become much more efficient. I recommend several test runs prior to use, especially with attaching the Travelmate to a car seat. Pricey yes, but I think the Travelmate is worth every penny."
39739,2,"I assumed a ""white noise"" type of machine would have a true white noise setting. Not the case. This one only has womb and nature sounds. Do they really think that ""seagull"" and ""buoy"" settings are good sleeping sounds for children?"
138004,0,"The turtle serves as a sweet nightlight because the shell glows, but it has to be placed very close to the ceiling in order for the stars to actually have any shape. I put my daughter's turtle on her dresser and it just made pale blobs of colored light on the walls and ceiling. In order to actually discern the blobs as stars, the turtle had to be lifted to within a couple feet of the ceiling."
164149,0,"We were trying to purchase an infant head support that would support a tiny head, this head rest is much to large for an infant. The pillow section is not small enough to hold by daughter's head in place. Probably great for a toddler, not so good for an infant."
97803,1,I love the ventaire bottles! I have at least a dozen of them for my 5 month old son. He has less gas and is way easier to burp with this bottle than the old standard bottles. I do like the fact that the bottom comes off because that is the hardest part of a bottle to clean. I don't understand why some mother's didn't like this bottle. My mother always taught me to take a sterilized needle and poke the nipple that way the nipple will work fine and I has since I did that. Yes a bottle is a bottle but this is by far the best!
123129,1,"I love this pack n play! The other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us (and they were twice the price).... It was the one with a changing table and bassinet. I finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger, boxier and roomier. My son hates restraints and being boxed in, but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play, and is willing to stay in it for 20-30 minutes at a time (a record!). And he is 2.5 now, so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere...."
47533,0,"Bought this bassinet because description states it can be converted into a playpen. This is not the case! We travel a lot and thought it would be great for that. Also not the case. As other reviewers have said, this thing is a pain, at best, to set up and take down. The bars do not want to lock! We have taken it down on three separate occasions. Each time it has taken 15-20minutes to set up again. The size is great, not too large and clunky. Storage underneath is a great idea but we have never used it. You must sit on the floor to access it. Love the extra pockets on the sides. These are great for holding diapers and wipes for middle of the night changings. Overall not really worth it for us. Should have just gone with a pack n play. Wanted to return it but couldn't get it to fit back into the shipping box."
180269,1,"As a first time mother, I had no idea what I would & wouldn't need...I have to say, every ursing mother needs this pump. Even if you have the pump in style, get one of these for quick, on-the-go pumping needs. I have both pumps & only use the harmony- it is so convenient. I can pump 6 oz in less than 10 minutes, the pump attaches to all of our various bottles, & it is so easy to clean with only 4 easy parts. I've used this pump for car trips where it would be great to feed the baby bottles in order to not have to stop every two hours. I just pump near the time baby may wake up & voila, warm fresh bottle in minutes. I could go on & on - a must have!!!!"
145023,1,"I have the SkipHop Duo. All the reviews I read (after purchase) said it was too small. I find I can actually cram a ton in there.FRONT POCKETS: wipe solution, diaper salve, hand sanitizer, bottle of Advil, camera, cell phoneSIDE POCKETS: bottle or water bottle for mom, reusable bags for shoppingTOP ZIPPERS: mom's side- pads, gift cards, first aid kit, oxy spray, misc mom ""junk"". Baby side-socks, mittens, pacifiers, etc (both zipper pockets have more room in them, i just don't know what else to put in)INSIDE POCKETS: 3-4 rolled up AIO Bum Genius diapers and wipes (I put 1-2 wipes inside the diaper before i roll. that way i know when i grab i'm getting both the diaper and the wipe. my husband didn't know this routine, so he diapered our son with the dry wipe inside- gotta love him!). extra onesie (or 2). a disposable (just in case, but never needed). wet bag rolled up.INSIDE: receiving blanket (rolled), burp clothes, my wallet (which is a Hobo clutch), holds lip glosses galore), sling, snack for mom.i use a carabiner to hold my keys on one of the stroller straps.My key is to roll most things. I found this handy when I travelled a lot. It also makes it easier to blindly find things in the bag b/c you can tell what something is by the size of the roll."
124162,2,I ordered a blanket for my new grandson who is due to be born any day now and this is not a blanket. It is very tiny and is smaller than a burp cloth. Very disappointed customer.
113541,1,"We are satisfied with this purchase! It is so nice to be able to stick everything in the dishwasher, and the base is quick and easy to clean. We couldn't be happier. If you are deciding to go with this or a more expensive high chair, try this and you will likely be happy you did."
154179,1,They are nice and soft wipes and I LOVE that they are unscented. I have never had a problem with them drying my kids' skin. They are also very convenient in the travel packs.
90012,1,"Prior to joining Amazon moms, I would scour the store ads trying to find ANY diaper on sale for less than 17 cents/diaper. After joining Amazon moms and subscribe & save, as well as using an Amazon on-line coupon, we pay less than 12 cents per diaper. These diapers work perfectly for our son. Great fit, no leaks, no rash. I love the light scent of baby powder and our little guy loves seeing the different Sesame characters. Highly recommend Pampers Baby Dry."
53965,2,"Great idea, just a few gliches. Light must be in the &quot;on&quot; position to work so you have to remember to turn it on at night. Remote control only works half the time and light only stays on for about 5 seconds, too short for me. Also light must attach to car seat base and it gets in the way when you're putting baby seat in it. I discovered reaching up and turning on my dome light in the car is just as effective and a lot easier. Mirror works great and gives me peace of mind to see that my baby is doing okay. Save a few bucks and just buy a mirror."
4540,1,"I originally bought this bag thinking of my husband, but I love it too!! We both love the design, it has a lot of storage space and is functional too. I really love the handy wipe container and changing pad in the back pocket! It's definitely durable and will put up with a lot of use! I would recommend this bag for sure!!"
163400,0,"We are a bit disappointed with this. Straps are not easily removed, make the seat uncomfortable if you don't have the need to strap your child in. Worse is that the tray mechanism is very difficult to slide in and out. You have to force one side or the other every time. Not very graceful. Would not buy again. Looking to replace it actually. Cheap is an understatement."
109281,1,So this is what my husband and I came up with to help our exclusively breastfed daughter through teething. We didn't want to offer her ice since she's still so young (she started teething at 3 months) and she just wasn't taking to the teether rings yet. She liked to chew on our fingers or her own the best! She received a set of those mesh feeder things for Christmas (Thanks sister!) So we took some breast milk and froze it into ice cubes (half full to accommodate baby mouth size) and offered that to her. Success! Her look of surprise and then enthusiasm was priceless!
92050,1,"I love this pillow. I bought an expensive 's' shaped body pillow as well as a regular body pillow, and could not get comfortable with either of them during my pregnancy. Then I bought this wedge and it's perfect! I can place it right under my belly and it helps me fall asleep easier. For the price, it is well worth it!"
25421,0,"This set does some things that it claims to do. It sticks on pretty well, but does NOT remove cleanly. You have to go back there with a scraper and cleaning solution to clean out the adhesive. I stuck it onto Command strips to get a clean removal.My two-year-old son can't open it, no matter how much he pulls on the door, and his fingers have never got pinched in it. You need to stick it close to the outer edge, like the other reviewers mention.For drawers, it doesn't work if your drawers are nested in a hollow frame, like mine. The edge is too narrow for the lock to stick properly, and the drawers stick out a bit and don't close all the way. You want to feel inside the top of your drawer to make sure it goes back all the way if you want to use this lock.These locks are also not the best solution for a corner cabinet. I had to use two locks just to wedge in the door somehow, and it still won't work once my son figures out that he just has to pull the door sideways instead of outwards to open it.I bought these locks thinking they would be a good solution in my rental because I wouldn't have to drill any holes, but now, what with the locks not removing cleanly, I wonder if it was worth the effort and the extra money."
9654,1,My three year old used this when she wouldn't go alone and needed this is the Living Room. It was a great seat because she could sit back and just go. She's moved on since then but I will remember this great seat always and keep it for my son for next year!
51899,0,"On the first day taking my baby (she is 10 lbs) out for a jog, the stroller performed great (even on swivel mode). However, it shaked and shimmied a lot on the subsequent jogs. I don't think it will last or be stable once my baby gains more weight. I would recommend it if for stroll or a very slow slow jog. I ranked it 3 stars for its price & looks. BTW, you can find this product on Walmart.com and it saves you about $30! Also free shipping if you ordered online with them and go pick up at a store close by to you!"
91045,1,"My little one is now 11 weeks old and since she was 5 weeks old I have carried her in the Snugli - she loves it and so do I! It tightens secure so that her head stays still and she is facing towards you (you still need to place your hand on the head if you are to lean over). What a life saver, I am able to do housework, errands, rock her to sleep! I really hated the car-carrier - so bulky and HEAVY, with this I just take her out of the car-carrier, strap her in and (with the little front pocket for my wallet -) we are off to shop. It certianally allows for more freedom. I cannot tell you how many parents (moms and dads) wished they had had this for their children. A must have!!"
31107,1,I really like this stroller however the basket could be a little larger and easier to get too. It does not have a standard cup holder but mine came with one and it would be great if it had a harder one. I understand that it needs to be soft for your little one but they could put it to the outside of the stroller towards you that way it won't get in the way of your little one standing or getting in/out of the stroller. Very light weight stroller and that's great. We recently took it on a weekend trip and I have no complaints about the weight or how it handles. As explained before it could use some improvements with other things.
20846,1,"These bags are so helpful to sterilize pacifiers, tubing for breastpumps, Take-N-Toss spoons, pretty much anything baby needs! I use these bags everyday for everything...even some of our stuff! Great product!"

158935,1,"After buying one bottle of every brand sold..to find out which would work for my son, I found Dr.Browns to be the absolute BEST! Yes they are a pain to clean with the vents but your baby will not be screaming in pain from gas after eating...really these work! When the vents get nasty I just toss them and buy the replacements..they aren't that expensive!"
71195,1,I bought this for my Granddaughter who at the time was 3 months old. We are doing daycare for her for 6 months and wanted a few things to keep her occupied. she loved this chair from day one and the fact I can convert it to a toddler rocker was great. The Amazon price was very reasonable and it was well worth the money. she is now 5 months old and still loves sitting in it for short periods of time. she also likes playing with the hanging toys. A good buy
87883,1,"my daughter loved this, she liked the toys, we used it only for couple of months, after that she out grown. useful only for small kids 0-4/5 months"
123358,1,Bought this item for my 6month old granddaughter.... She can play happily with room to learn some new tricks while her mom can get her chores done without out worrying what the little one has gotten into.The design is bright and cheerful and easy to set up and move around.
26469,0,"The music is bad, and no it doesn't rock automatically, but this great looking EB bassinet get's the job done. My premature son didn't mind the padding or the canopy other reviews indicate. I appreciate the additional storage underneath so I dont have to leave the room for anything.If you're into the ""look"", as I was as a new mom and matching things, the Eddie Bauer Collection is one to be reckoned with and this bassinet - - get's the job done!"
174483,1,"We had originally purchased the Symphony Animal Mobile by Tiny Love. My daughter was a little over 2 months old when the motor died on it. She had just started gazing at it for 5 min increments. It was very large and bulky and didn't seem to entertain her at all. We chose to try this one and we couldn't be happier. Not to mention her! She has never spent more than 5-10 min of interest in any toy. Not her swing, playmat, or bouncy seat. The first time I put her in her crib with this new mobile her entire face just lit up. She spent over a half hour mesmerized by it. She was laughing and cooing the entire time. She did the same thing that evening. Nothing has held her attention longer than this mobile. I love that it has 12 different stage interchangeable attachments that can be rattles later on. Hard and soft rattles. The remote is great and it works well. It isn't too big and bulky yet it has enough to it to make my daughter laugh. I think it isn't as over stimulating as the Symphony mobile. The 3 different music options are great. Lullabies, classical and white noise. It does have a volume control which works great. The fact that it pauses intermittently gives my daughter a chance to really focus on the animals or toys. You can swing the mobile out of the way when needed to pick her up and out of the crib. It can entertain her when you need some time to get things done and it has also helped her relax and go down for a nap. It is $5 cheaper than the Symphony mobile and comes with way more including the remote control. This mobile is well worth every penny and our best investment yet. Buy this and watch your baby's face light up. You won't regret this investment."
174466,1,"I love this mobile. It stops on its own, has a remote, and it's bright enough for my son to look at. He is 6 weeks and already smiles up at h is &quot;little friends&quot;. The music is great, sounds clear and u can adjust the volume.It has great features for a great price. I definatly recommend buying this or adding it to your registry."
58162,1,"I absolutely love this walker. I love the fact that the activities on the front are simple and don't overwhelm my daughter. I also love that it has brakes, and that it moves at a slower pace. Very happy with this purchase."
94478,1,"We used Avent with our first son almost 5 years ago. I did run into some leaking problems that came from the white cap screwing onto the bottle. I found if I tightened the bottle a bit more it eliminated the leaks completely. After figuring this out, we had no more problems. We are expecting our second child in a few months and I have started to buy Avent again. Our first son did not have a whole lot of gas problems. Of course he was gassy at times, so I can't say he had no gas, but he didn't appear to have so much gas where it was bothering him. I really liked the wide bottle with Avent. It made it more comfortable for me to hold then later on when our son got to be old enough the wide bottle made it easy for him to hold. Avent also has handles that attach to the bottles when your baby/toddler gets old enough to hold the bottle by themselves. The handles were wide and colorful and made holding easy for little hands. The nipples I did feel at first were a bit hard, but our son never had any problems taking it. Of course, this will vary amoung babies. After just purchasing a 3 pack of 4 oz bottles for impending baby #2 I opened up the package after seeing the advertisement for ""extra soft nipple"" and it is indeed softer then it was 5 years ago. If you are looking to save money, I suggest either buying very few 4oz bottles or simply buying the 9 oz or even 11 oz bottles instead as they outgrow the 4 oz very quickly. We had no problems cleaning these bottle as well and they held up very well. We never had to replace them."
160123,0,"I really like this swaddler but the velcrow doesn't stick well after 2 washes, maybe because i put it in the dryer."
2944,1,"We received this as a shower gift for our son. I started out breastfeeding, but later, due to medical reasons, had to bottle feed. It works wonderfully for both! The baby is very comfortable, and, if you place baby just right, it leaves mom with an empty hand! Awesome if you are trying to eat at the same time, or just want to read a magazine...just be sure that baby is stable. : ) We also use this for tummy time. I can't wait until he is trying to sit up...it will be used for that, too! I love products that more than one purpose!!!"
6245,1,"We love our in sight video monitor! We use it at every nap and all night long. You turn off the monitor and just get sound if you want, but rather than geting up or opening our sons door at every peep I just check the monitor. The image and sound are crystal clear and we dont ever get interfearance. The best part is watching him play in the middle of the night or when he first wakes up and we're not in the room. I once went in to get his thumb out of his mouth since I saw him sucking on it clear as day on the monitor but when I went in his room, I couldnt even see his face, thats how clear the image is!As for a movement monitor, Its called angle care movement and breathing detector. We got one but never used it since he was in our room the first 3 months and now I can hear him breathing on the Sights and sounds monitor."
133781,1,We just installed a bunch of these and they look great! There are two versions (regular and decorative outlets (one screw or two)). Check before you buy! They were a quick install and they look like they will last!
173269,1,This is a fantastic baby monitor system. Very clear with hardly any static. The cords are long enough in case you don't want to use batteries. The color options are great too. I would highly reccomend this monitor. Great for the price.
150351,2,"I give this product 2 starts because the cover is wonderfully soft. However, I'm returning it because it's not the soft light blue as pictured. It's a darker, cornflower blue with the tiniest purple tinge to it. I might buy again in white just to be sure I know what it will look like. Great product other than being a different color than pictured!"
158748,1,This is the best apparel for sleeping. I bought the cottons ones now for warmer weather and stocked up on the fleece ones for the winter. I wouldn't recommend anything else. Keeps those baby toes nice and warm.
40554,1,"I've tried Huggies supreme and regular Pampers. I had problems with my son leaking while wearing Pampers at a VERY early age (0-2 months). Then my wife and I (we) switched to Huggies supreme. The held back leakage better, but still would occasionally and when a Huggies would be left on over some time (ie extended outings or though the night) they left all those absorbant crystals on my son. I think I tried Cruisers out of default because it was the only one available in his size one time. We loved them ever since. No crystals, even when the diaper is SATURATED...none! We do get the occasional leak, but not like before.If you're having trouble with your current diaper, give these a try. You and your little one will not regret it. Worst case, just switch back to your old ones. Good luck."
119370,1,"im a first time mom and I saw this pillow on the reality show ""Bethany Ever After""I love this pillow. it makes breast feeding so much easier. helps your posture so u don't slump over your baby. baby loves it too."
42563,1,"I was given a Moby as a baby shower gift. I LOVED it. I was a G cup while breastfeeding and didn't have any problems using the carrier. It took about two practice tries to get the hang of putting it on but after that it was easy. My son loved to travel in the carrier and it was nice to have one that I could face him outwards as he was very interested in seeing everything around him. When he would get tired, flipping him to an inward facing hold was easy. I also used the carrier for nursing a few times and it worked just fine. I used it until my son was about nine months old. Basically, he just got too heavy to carry in the front and I never really got comfortable with putting him on my back with the Moby. (I watched videos on YouTube and tried at home on a bed but it just never felt as safe as I wanted it to be) I've moved on to a backpack style carrier. The short ""life-span"" for using the wrap was the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I look forward to having another baby and using it again.Pros:1) really is a one-size-fits-all kind of carrier, I am a plus-size woman and I was able to use this carrier without a problem whereas the baby bjorn felt a little confining2) very comfortable with nothing that can break3) fast option if you have multiple errands where the baby will be in and out of the carrier4) both outward and inward options for baby as well as front and back carrying options5) easy to clean6) nursing is possible while baby is in carrier7) keeps the baby warm if want skin-to-skin contact timeCons:1) have to learn how to put the carrier on and it may take a few tries2) shorter time of use than other carriers if you are uncomfortable laying your baby on your back and tying the wrap around him or her (as I was)3) can be too warm for summer months"
71301,1,"My son received this chair for Christmas when he was a month old. He always loved sitting in it as a baby and still loves it now that he is 2. It is really something that will last a long time. I never had a problem with it tipping over, but I was always there with him when the kickstand was back and he was rocking. You have to rock it pretty hard for it to actually tip. And I stopped using the buckle when he was old enough to get out by himself (about 6-7 months). I guess with every toy, you have to be careful and know what you child is capable of doing with it."
102764,2,"We purchased this diaper pail, like others, due to the price and the fact I could use regular bags. It worked great for us until around the solid food/step 3 foods time. Then, it went from being moderately stinky to toddler-poopy-diaper-significantly stinky. I expected some smells to emit from this item, but I can smell my son's diapers from the stairs, and his room smells atrocious if I don't change the bag *every* day. So much for saving money on garbage bags vs. refills. Also, purchasing refills for the &quot;odor neutralizing disk&quot; is difficult, as they are hard to find. I tried bleach, Febreez, a stick up, dryer sheet, Lysol spray, and even sprinkled carpet deodorizer in the bottom to no avail. Additionally, the mechanism that &quot;pinches&quot; the bag shut falls apart often (springs come off), and will get stuck open once you have about 6 diapers in there due to the weight of the bag, and my toddler has figured out how to open it. (and you know the rest...)Conclusion: an inexpensive alternative diaper pail, but is *NOT* odor free. Spend the money on the diaper dekor plus, as you will want to once your little one becomes a toddler."
29865,0,just average; collapsable bins often fall out because the back is open and you have to place them just right or they're crooked. Overall okay for the price.
102840,2,"OK, ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, THE PALE IS COVERED AND BABY CAN NOT GET INTO IT. IT TAKES REGULAR TRASH BAGS AND THAT IS NICE TOO. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO DID THE ORIGINAL TESTING FOR THIS PRODUCT BEFORE HITTING THE MARKET. I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE WOULD CALL THIS THING ODOR FREE. WE HAD TO DUMP IT 1 OR 2 TIMES A DAY TO KEEP THE ODOR DOWN. BY THAT POINT I DON'T EVEN SEE THE SENSE IN HAVING IT, WHY NOT JUST TAKE ALL THE DIAPERS OUTSIDE? WE HAD TO WASH IT DOWN WITH THE WATER HOSE AND DISH SOAP, THEN LEAVE IT OUTSIDE FOR 2 DAYS TO GET THE SMELL OUT. DURING THAT TIME WE SAVED OUR PLASTIC GROCERY BAGS, WRAPPED THE DIRTY AND SOILED DIAPERS IN THE PLASTIC BAG AND TOOK THEM OUTSIDE TO THE TRASH. THAT WAS THE BEST WAY TO KEEP THE SMELL OUT. MAYBE MY SONS POOP SMELLS WORST THAN OTHER BABIES, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT IF YOU WANT THIS PRODUCT SAVE YOUR MONEY....YOU CAN HAVE MINE."
101549,1,The thought of bottles and a drying rack on my limited counter top space made me cringe. I absolutely love the Skip Hop Splash drying rack and don't mind leaving it out on the counter. It is easy to clean and has lots of spaces for drying. One thing to note: the color is not a bright white color. It's more of an off white.
3535,0,"I am doing my nursery in Winnie The Pooh and I thought these bumble bee curtains would be the perfect finishing touch.The valance is okay, nothing special, but I am going to keep it and put up pale yellow curtains under them.I purchased two sets of curtains, they were different lengths, different colors, and had torn seams, very poor quality, especially for approximately $50 a set!I would NOT recommend these curtains."
105531,1,"While both the Safety First ""Neat Diaper"" and the Baby Trend ""Diaper CHamp"" got good overall reviews, the difference between the ""Neat Diaper"" and the ""Diaper Champ"" is incomparable! The Neat Diaper has an internal second chamber that you have to literally stuff the diaper into, which is a tight space, awkward (actually scraped skin off a knuckle), risks getting pooh on hands. The Diaper Champ, in contrast, let's you simply drop the diaper into a shute which is atop the device, then flip knob, and, voila, it's gone - no awkward stuffing into internal chamber. ALso, the Neat Diaper requires that you use their brand of plastic bags, which didn't last very long, while the Champ let's you use any common medium trash baggie (though a bit awkward to install) Wasted my money on the Neat Diaper. Don't know why this problem was not noted by other reviewers. The Diaper CHamp is our new champion."
7621,1,"I have my daughter every other weekend. When she would sleep, I would jump to check on her when there was any type of sound that could have been a cry. I hated how her mother's monitoring device had feedback and picked up everything; from a door slamming to someone bouncing a ball down the street. At first I thought it was so silent (lack of background noise) that it would miss her grumps as she starts to wake up, not so with this device. It was clear and picked up her first peeps. Good stuff and thank you. - Single Dad"
115948,2,I thought I'd give them a try even if given bad comments and i was wrong.....they are too small and to thin. Waste of money!
48412,1,"The thing I really liked about this was as a first time Mom I am able to see what the little gal is doing without getting up every 30 seconds. It is nice to just tap the button and see what she is doing. The video quality is a bit poor but I didn't expect to be able to see much with a night vision camera. We have a night-light in the room and leave a nearby bathroom light on so the night pic is easy to see. I think the ability to see her without getting up in nice otherwise I would be in her room all night checking on her. We also have a highly ""teched up"" house and we do get interference but that was to be expected."
66002,1,"These bottles have been wonderful for us. My son was colicky, and I was using the avent bottles. His burp cloth would be soaked by the time he was finished. When we switched, you immediatly heard the differents. The only disadvantage I could say about these bottles would be to clean them. They have several parts to them. He recently turned 6 months, and was ready for a bigger size bottle. I switched back to avent bottles, for convenience for one whole day. I got the same results as before. I have a small microwave, that the tall Dr. Brown bottles wouldn't fit in. I ended up buying the short Dr. Brown bottles, that are made like the avent. They have been as great as the small ones. I will never switch again!!!!! I would recommend these bottles to anyone, they really work in reducing air intake, and they aren't as messy either."
95454,1,the toy hammock is way bigger than what i thought it would be and holds a lot of stuffed animals.
142732,1,"I tried the KidCo gates and immediately replaced them with the DreamBaby gates primarily because they are self-closing. These gates just work, right out of the box. No manual needed, quick installation without any tools, and peace of mind with the 'click' you hear each time you walk through. Happy wife, happy life, so I'm lovin' these gates! :)Follow-up note - if you have older kids in the house, you might find the gates tend to become pushed out of alignment as the kids tend to lean on them when opening. If you find yourself continually adjusting the gate alignment, just use the positioning pads (with screws) that come with the gates to ensure a one-time installation."
181998,1,"I have b/g twins. The girl potty trained doing the intensive 1 day thing based on a book that was going around at 2.5yrs.The little boy did not want to potty train. So we would try once a month. Finally at 3, I decided we needed to get serious. I tried a dozen suggestions before we found something that worked. Hopefully yours will go smoother, but we definitely experienced the stereotypical ""boys are harder to train""I ended up getting a Peter Potty toddler urinal. It can be set for a range of heights, it flushes and is easy to empty once a day. Once they learn how to stand, there is no overspray or dribbling which is a personal pet peeve. I set a timer and we would run to it every 20 minutes for a week before he really started to get it. We made it a game since the m&m; thing didn't work for us. Note that if you use it every 20 minutes you will have to refill the water resevior and empty the container more than once a day!This really worked well for us when nothing else did. I never thought I would install a urinal in my house, but I am happy to have it. In answer to some of the other comments, we have it against a wall and it feels very sturdy and have not had any problems with it being tipped over."
10107,1,"We had a cheapo toilet-top seat before this -- it was messy, pee shield too low, had a rough edge which hurt my son. This cost two-three times as much, but MAN is it better! It's awesome -- easy to clean, pee shield tall but safe, comfy for him to sit on... and we're finally making potty training progress! I HIGHLY recommend this seat."
40897,1,"Speaking from experience, these diapers are the best. With our first boy we tried everything - from bargain to expensive - and had a lot of accidents to show for it. With our second son we just went with the Swaddlers and Cruisers and the only accidents we had were due to parental error, usually in the middle of the night! I have been so happy with just using Swaddlers/Cruisers with this baby that I tell all expectant moms to just forgo the diaper sampling and go for the best!"
64538,0,"I was really happy when my gates (I ordered 2 gates) arrived within 3 days. One of the gates was in perfect condition while the other gate had a broken door hinge (which is nothing more than a small wooden dowel that the door swings on). I think the construction of the doggie door was not thought out very well. It is extremely flimsie and is not built to be used very often or to last for very long. You can tell that ""cheap"" was the main concern with the company who built these gates. I'm really surprised that the gates on both were not broken during shipping. I now have to tie the door with a piece of twine. I choose not to return the gate because I needed it right away because of an elderly sick pet and I didn't want to go through the hassle of packing it up, mailing it back and waiting for a new gate to arrive. I really burns me to have had to pay for a broken gate. Other than this compliant the gates are a good height and they fit tightly in the doorways. If I had to buy gates over again, I would go to the local pet stores and check them over in person for quality before ordering."
54777,1,"We love it and use it every day. It's SO nice that the music plays for a full 15 minutes. He loves it, and it actually gives enough time for baby to relax and fall asleep. The five minute ones you just have to keep re-starting. Ours only clicked when baby got big enough to grab the little toys and stop the movement. Someone was complaining because they couldn't stop the movement and just play music, but the moving part completely detatches so the music ""box"" can play without it. I'd buy this one again in an instant. It's lasted a long time, and we've gotten a lot of use out of it."
56204,1,"They were super cheap, but good quality, easy to clean, and BPA free. I ordered them because a friend told me about them and they're great. I bought about six to accommodate for my sons feedings and my laziness sometimes, but they're great."
32689,1,"My daughter, now six and a half months, LOVES this carrier!!! We have had it since she was a little over a month old and have used it ever since we got it. The baby faces your chest when they do not have the ability to hold their head up yet. As long as you adjust the height limit correctly, they are positioned just fine. (I LOVE being able to lean down and kiss her little head while carrying her!!!) When they are able to hold their head up, then the fun begins. :) That's when my daughter really began to enjoy this carrier...it seems everything else you put babies in shows them where they've been instead of where they are going...now they can see what's ahead. :) I love how it keeps them close. It's perfect for taking your little one to the grocery store or a discount store when you are by yourself and have to push a grocery cart. My husband thinks this carrier is tops...it's his favorite way to carry our little girl. It's easy on the shoulders and back and very easy to clean. You won't go wrong with this one. It's a lot of money, but it is SO worth it!! We LOVE it!!"
124841,2,"I purchased these, thinking that all outlet covers are the same, and I liked the price. However, my 8 month old son can easily slip his tiny pointer finger behind them and pop them out."
169090,1,"V good product,I tried other brands and found pampers are best for my 3 weeks old baby.I tried huggies and found pampers to be best and this package is easy to order online in amazon."
46067,1,"my 2 month old son LOVES this mobile. he used to hate being changed, now with this mobile above his changing table he loves it. he'll start smiling and laughing as soon as we lay him down, and he won't take his eyes off of the pictures. it doesnt move or have sound, but it doesnt matter, this is the best mobile ever. all you have to do is give it a little push when you lay the baby down and it'll sway back and forth for a while. even when its not moving my son still stares at it."
97809,1,"We recently visited our new born daughter who we are adopting from Guatemala and we took both these and the Dr.Brown's bottles. We really loved VentAire bottles. Our daughter preferred these to Dr.Brown's and we found that both left her with very little or no gas after feedings. As far as assembly and parts the VentAir is easier to manage than Dr.Brown. It is important to have the bottles completly dry before assembly to avoid leaks and for sanitary reasons but we did not find that a hassle at all. Sure it's one or two extra steps compared to old fashion bottles but it's worth it to have a happy gas free baby after feedings. Also, it makes it tons easier to clean the bottles because the bottoms come right off and you can scrub them easily. There were no problems with flow even after we boiled the vents and parts for cleaning. Overall, I think this is a great bottle."
41598,1,"This is a great monitor system for many reasons. The sound quality is superb. I tested it out when we first recieved it as a baby shower gift and was amazed by how clear and crisp it was. I could stand in one room and whisper and my wife could hear everything I said.Its very easy to use with only a few settings. Its nice to have two monitors so you can have them in different rooms around the house so you don't need to carry the same one with you where ever you go.Some people that have reviewed this item mention the reception being awful and exchanging it for a better brand. I think it depends on the area you live in and how much other interference you might get. I have no complaints about the reception and its still working great after 4 months. Infact its so clear that I can hear the neighbors dog behind us barking through the monitor. The little night light on the main monitor that sits in the babies room can sometimes come in useful, but I have had a few problems turning it on and off. It seems like the switch keeps getting caught and so won't turn on or off easily."
34213,0,"My wife and I had our first baby on 10/2/11. We had to take a trip in early December by air. This bag fit the entire infant carrier and car base, plus a few other items. In the airport, it is a little unwieldy as it is rather large. I wouldn't recommend someone alone travelling with this and the baby. It might even be a bit much for a smaller person to whip around. The backpack type straps are a nice addition. I did use them to carry it through the airport at our destination. Don't forget, most airlines let car seats fly for free. They did weigh it, and on the return, they were going to try and make us take some stuff out because only the seat flies for free, but was able to convince her to let me leave my items in there. It will just depend on your attendant.I would have gave it 5 stars, but when we came home, we noticed it had ripped. I think my wife will be able to fix it, and it is probably more a problem with the airport, but it shouldn't have ripped during our first trip. The price is right, so it isn't that great big of a deal. Based on price, I would still recommend this."
122923,1,"we got this present as a gift - and what a god send. my baby just sleeps so much better and for longer periods while wrapped up in it. at first i was a little startled because it reminded me so much of a straight jacket, but after seeing how well my baby slept in it, i am completely past it. when he sleeps on his back, his arms flail in his sleep and he startles easily, waking himself up. i don't want to put him on his belly because of increased sids risks. this blanket keeps him from startling and still on his back, so it solves everything."
77338,1,I had this swing with my first child and had to buy another when I had my second daughter. This is truley the perfect swing.
10582,2,"The product name is known forever but the flat diapers were way too thin for what I needed. The price was reasonable but much too thin. OK for polishing, cleaning, etc but not for my creations."
88895,1,"I had good luck with these diapers, but found the Swaddlers fit better. These Baby Dry don't have the stretchy tabs, so they are harder to get a good fit. I know the size 3 has the stretchy tabs, but I guess the smaller sizes don't. These diapers never leaked! I always have great luck with Pampers products. Would definitely recommend."
177808,1,"I bought this crib because we're doing renovations on our house and there is only one room to sleep in right now. We bought a regular sized crib but it is set up in our room, so it makes sleeping difficult for all. We got this it is the only sturdy portable crib I've ever seen comes with everything no need to buy mattress and my god sent now we can all have a good nights sleep, and what I like the most you don't have to take it down to go from room to room it completely fits through the doorway."
16725,1,"I bought this for my little girl and she has a blast with it. My only problem, its cheaper at walmart!"
48289,1,Good picture and sound. Doesn't seem to interfere with any or household electronics or appliances. Buying this monitor has really helped us as new parents. Infra-red night view works well.Two complaints - Video automatically shuts off to conserve battery capacity and color is off. The color isn't a huge deal for us though.
25606,0,"I love the principle of this sippy, it keeps my daughter's milk cold enough for a 4 hour trip shopping so I'm not worried about warm/spoiled milk. However after using the sippy cup everyday for about 2-3 weeke it began to seriously leak, mainly from the smaller hole making the cup useless. I still use it on trips to town, so to that end it still fills the need, however as an everyday cup it's not the best.Some people have commented on the 4 part lid being difficult to assemble, which baffles me. If you've ever used a sippy with a valve in it you can manage this. I just pull all the pieces apart and put everything in the top rack of the dishwasher for cleaning, with no issues."
154128,1,I used these wipes for a very long time now.I use them becuase I think they are healthier to my kids skin then other options I know on the market.In general I am pleased with it.
174394,2,"I am short, and I have been using this type of the Seat Belt Adjusters in all my cars to keep the belt from cutting into my neck. I have recently purchased a new car, and was very happy to discover this Adjuster on Amazon.com. However, upon arrival, the thing turned out to be totally unusable - the tongue does not even click, and all my attempts to fit the adjuster were unsuccessful. I guess, the quality is not there any more."
17623,1,"I purchased this stroller for my tall and thin 2 yr old. He has outgrown his Graco Quattro Tour stroller and while I could have changed strollers long ago, I wasn't committed to looking for a new one until I realized I had to because his knees touched the tray in front of him. We aren't joggers or outdoorsy-type people, and while the jogging strollers are great for taller kids they seemed too bulky for day-to-day use. I really like this Graco IPO stroller. It is small enough for shopping easily in malls or stores and has a small basket under the seat to store merchandise while shopping. The stroller can handle my purse hanging from the handles on the back without my son riding in it! I also like that it folds up very small and will recline. The reclining feature is a little strange, but it works! It doesn't stand alone, but I don't find this to be as a problem. I am very happy with this stroller, and very happy that I didn't have to spend $$$."
23221,1,"This flattens the bags as you freeze them, so they take up less space in the fridge, great if you're trying to built up inventory to go back to work or on a trip. The lid works as a storage bin if your freezer (like mine) is too small to use it as a lid."
68101,1,Love this set! Easy to use and looks beautiful. I am very pleased with this purchase as it shipped fast and had no damage done to the packaging.
6461,0,"My son uses pamper since day one. I was very happy with cruisers before, but the new pampers cruisers has a new liner which leave a lot white bead-like stuff on my son's bottom. After looking those previous review, I know I am not along."
113690,1,"I bought this booster chair to have at our house for when we have our grandchildren over. It is sturdy, easy to use and very space savings. Love the fact you can put the trays in the dishwasher. Definately worth the price. I would recommend this product."
4236,1,"I was looking all over for a way to make my daughter's handprint in a way that would be easy to keep. My friend found this for me and I love it. I am going to get one for my neice for her 1st bithday. I didn't find the plaster hard to work with at all. I did use all of the mix, and it wasn't sticky for me. I had to redo the imprint a few times because she wouldn't lay her hand flat. All I had to do was tap the tin on the counter and the plaster smoothed out. I think it will be fun for her to look back at how much her little hand changed over the course of 5 years."
161025,1,"I picked this bag because I wanted something that both my husband and I could use. I didn't want anything girlie looking or too big and bulky and this was perfect. The size is great. It can hold at least 2 days worth of diapers, wipes (40 pack), diaper cream, change of clothes, bottle, toys, snacks, pretty much anything you might need for baby for the day. The messenger style makes it easy on your back and the strap is padded and very comfortable. It might seem like a lot of money for a bag but to me its definitely worth it. Just think, cost per use. It's a winner!"
61022,2,"this product was a waste of $ with our first baby. and, if someone uses it who doesn't know how to correctly twist it messes up the whole process. we have opted for the diaper dekor with our current pregnancy which has proved to be easy and stink-free. definitley worth the extra cash. we even bought two since we have a two story home."
164546,1,"Guess what this does? That's right, it keeps my floor from getting poop on it. Guess what that makes this product? Wonderful. Yep no poop on floor = wonderful."
169158,1,Good diaper and good price. Did not leak and I love it for that.
33802,1,"[THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN EDITED BELOW. I'D DOWNGRADE THIS FROM 4 STARS TO 2 IF I COULD.]managing dirty diapers was one of my greatest fears, but one gets used to it. (i was so phobic about diapers that i had my partner change almost all the diapers in the first month of our baby's life, but babies have a gentle way to introduce you into parenthood.) i finally got brave and got these and am satisfied enough to continue.PROS:- they're designed/sewn to dry faster in the dryer.- the price is awesome! it's cheaper than other all-in-ones and even pocket diapers and fitted ones.- it's very easy to use, quite similar to disposables.- 100% cotton! this makes the diaper not as dry like fleece or microfibers, but i'm all about natural fibers. i change my baby's diapers very often - even if the diaper feels dry, how would you like it if you had to sit in your soiled undies??!- the waterproofing cover does seem breathable - not so plastic/vinyl/rubber-like.CONS:- IT LEAKS! this is a big minus because the diapers don't fit super-tight. HOWEVER, i think it seems to leak because these don't hold as much as disposables.- yep, they don't hold much at all, so i don't recommend these for overnights or lengthy naps.- since they get saturated quickly, you have to change your baby very, very often.- the one-size-fits-all idea is a bit of a stretch since it seems tougher to fit newborns.despite the leaking, i'm really glad that i got the nerve to try these because i was sooooo scared of all the pee and poo. the leaking issue is a sacrifice for wanting to diaper in 100% cotton instead of microfleece. since i was already removing the solid #2s into the toilet with the disposables (you're supposed to do that), it wasn't a big deal. (i recommend flushable liners to make it even easier.) i get icky about wiping my own [...], so if i can use cloth, anyone can.[EDITED ON 12/31/2008]i've used these for quite some time, and my partially potty-trained baby leaks almost everyday. i attribute this to the combo of the diapers not being absorbent and them not fitting as snugly as other kinds. i wish there were better 100% cotton diapers out there, but it's very annoying, esp when i have to wash all the sheets. i would've given these 3 stars, but when i wrote a 3-star (average) review on the company's website about the leakage issue, they removed my review, so visitors only see the perfect 5-star reviews. NOT cool at all."
10249,1,This has been a great for our son. We are looking forward to using it with our daughter. No nasty cleanup. We just clean it when the clear the toilt. The only downside is that I wish that I had 2: one for down stairs and one for up stairs.
26861,0,"As I passed the 200 lb mark, the belt got more and more uncomfortable to wear. The middle setting was too tight, but the largest setting slipped right off me."
1778,1,"Compare to huggies, i like the pampers better! The first two month, I used huggies coz it has the shape for avoiding belly bottom but when he growing bigger, it started to leak, and it leaks a lot, since I changed the papers baby dry, it never leak again! Just made for my 3 month old baby."
174880,2,"""100% organic cotton and waterproof. Breathable yet waterproof polyurethane membrane backing.""The use of the term ""100% organic cotton"" is highly misleading. Perhaps the bit of cotton they use to make this is organic, but this item is hardly 100% organic. Polyurethane is one of the least natural/organic things you can expose your child to. They are exploiting the term organic to sell a piece of plastic."
5468,1,Really nice that it stays put on the floor. the velcro on the bottom sticks to the floor carpet in my SUV. i always keep the top open.
76672,0,"I purchased this along with a SkipHop Diaper Bag prior to having my first child. The pattern is cute and fun, but other than that this product isnt really useful. The only thing I ever really use is the bottle carrier. My son didnt take a pacifier, so the pouch became a coin holder, and you get wipes containers everytime you purchase wipes so I now have enough to open my own business. The laminated zip case became a catch all and the diaper holder only holds 4 diapers (which when do you only need 4 diapers when you go out)? I'm just going to chalk this purchase up to the one of the many products 1st time parents buy but dont really need."
124182,2,"As far as wet wipes go, this isn't bad. The cloths are a little thin and theres no way you can keep the wipes in your car without them drying out. The box is flimsy, but you know--- if you're wanting to avoid chemicals and come in contact with a few less toxins during the course of your day, then these might be just what you're looking for. Don't buy the boxes... buy the refills and insert them in your Huggies wipe box. You'll be a lot better off. One final question... why not offer a tin wipe box. If folks are concerned with the chems in their wet wipes, don't you think they'd be concerned about pthalates leaching into the wipes from the plasticizers in the box? If you're going to spend a little more on healthy wipes, might as well cover all your bases!"
145333,0,"We do not have an exersaucer, nor do we have decent door frames on our main level for a door jumper. This jumperoo seemed like the perfect happy medium, and after reading all the other rave reviews, we purchased it a couple months ago. However, our six month old is already bored with it--I can only get about ten minutes out of it before she starts fussing and wants out. Because of the weight of the tray and toys, it is not as ""springy"" as a door jumper, and she bounces in it but does not jump much. In addition, it lacks the portability of an exersaucer. More than once I've wished I could move it outside or upstairs or even room to room. If I could do it again, I think I'd purchase the door jumper for upstairs and an exersaucer for the main level."
173123,1,This product is a nice product that does the job it is made for. My only concern is that the car seat is not as tight using the latches as I would like it to be and when the seat protector is not there.
107481,1,"GREAT DESIGN, NEEDS TO BE LARGER!This is very easy to put on, though doesn't fit like the picture. The picture shows room for bottle, cups, etc. in the back, but most carts are so large that it takes most the fabric to cover the seat, leaving little room in the back and no possible way to use the pockets.I gave it four stars b/c it is quite colorful and the toys do entertain my son for a while-- long enough to do a little shopping and I feel safe with him in it with the seatbelt. My only suggestion would be to make it a bit longer in the back. Overall, it does cover the entire area where the child is and serves its purpose to keep the child from touching the carts."
53255,1,"We used this item with our first child over 4 years ago. When our child out grew this item we stored it for future use. Now 4 years later we are using it for our 2nd child and it still works like a champ. This is a life saver, both our children love sleeping in it. We sometimes leave the baby gliding all night long the battery life is extremely good. Lasting close to 1 month with heavy daily use. Daddy gives 2 thumbs up!!!"
20340,0,"These bottles weren't great, but they were acceptable.Negatives: My daughter liked them as a newborn but as she got older the slow nipples were too slow and the fast nipples were way too fast (made her gag and spit up). They were too many pieces to wash and put together and they leaked. I think washing the plastic stoppers in the dishwasher may have stretched them out a little casuing the leaking. A few times my husband forgot to put the plastic stopper on and dumped milk all over the counter (not daddy friendly!). I also felt that the wide nipple was a little too wide for my baby's mouth. I chose these because we mostly breast fed and I thought it would be most similar but I think the nipples are a little too wide.Positives: Cheaper than most other vent bottles. They did seem to help with preventing gas with the slow nipple. We had no issues going from breast to bottle and back again.I would recommend the Born Free bottles instead. We have now switched over completely to them. They are a little more pricey (can get good deals on ebay) but the medium nipples are perfect for my 5 month old. They are also easy to wash and put back together."
91425,1,"This monitor has been great, I have noticed a lot of people are having static trouble with it, I have not had static, however, when one or our cell phone chargers are plugged in to a nearby outlet we do get a loud buzzing sound. All I have to do is unplug the charger and that takes care of the buzzing. We do live very near the I-80 and I-81 junctions and we don't have any interference from the tractor trailers that may be using any radio devices. And there is a lot of trucks on 80 and 81 in PA that pass by all day and night long."
162393,0,"I don't have this set, but I do have the items. I got the thermomator in a two pack from saftey first, it cam e with a regular white thermomator. I never could get the clear one to work and I tried often over a year. I can't get it to give a reading, and it's not the batteries I don't think. The white one worked much better and was accurate. The nose thingy doesn't work at all. the thick band of rubber around the middle of the buylb makes it hard to sqeeze for me and it doesn't suck right. I just went back to the hospital after birth center and they gave me a new one and showed me how to use it. The nail clippers I have are the same, mine just don't have the little bulb handle. They work extremely well, I have very small hands so i don't need the buld on the end."
24868,1,I bought 2 of these gates to keep my dogs off the carpet and they are terrific. With a new baby the hands free gate is a must. This gate works great even in an uneven doorway since it's completely adjustable. The only issue is the width of the opening is kind of small but it hasn't been a problem.
79636,2,"I received this today.While the idea is great, it is made of very flimsy plastic and requires plastic nuts and bolts to assemble which are included but 2 of them snapped in half while assembling it. These bolts can not cost anything so I would have thought more than the required 6 would have been included. I would never recommend this item. I called the company that makes it but they were not available. They close at 4:30 p.m. EST. Don't buy it!"
81840,0,"I purchased this pump for occasional use while on maternity leave. It was a good investment for short time use, as I didn't want to spend the money on a more elaborate pump before I was sure that breastfeeding/pumping was well established. Once I got use to pumping, I was able to express about 4 ounces in about 10 minutes (massaging the breast while pumping really helps). It gave me the ability to build up a nice reserve of milk before going back to work, which was the main reason for the purchase. At times, I was sore after use, but with the suction adjustments, this was not an ongoing problem. The biggest drawback for me was the noise! It is rather loud and tends to sound like a cow mooing - not exactly conducive to pumping away from home! I have moved on to a Medela pump for full time use at work. It is much quieter and gentler, but also much more expensive."
40658,1,"We have tried all brands and this is by far our favorite. Our children have never had diaper rashes and we attribute this to the excellent absorbency of Cruisers. We also like the fit, as we have chubby babies and they fit nicely. It is totally worth the extra pennies per diaper. To sum up, we like the absorbency and the fit. We have tried all other brands from generic, competition and even other pampers products. None have even came close to Cruisers."
50373,1,"Awesome pillow...when my wife isn't usingit, our cat curls up inside it. when neither of them are in it, I bring it to the couch for a nap. it's awesome."
103392,1,"The width (29-44 approx), versatility in installation, and simplicity of this gate justify a 5 star rating from me.The ability to adjust top and bottom rails of the hinge side to different widths to accomodate molding or other uneven surfaces is a huge plus. I have thick molding and needed something with the freedom to adjust. This alone makes it a perfect fit for our 80 year old house and its stairway.This gate comes with a template, nice touch, as long as you have even and level wall surfaces to deal with. I don't! But after putting it together once, and then taking it apart again to make the adjustments I felt it needed, I was able to install this gate in our difficult stairway. The instructions recommend installing into wood or studs, and due to the plaster used on my walls and inability to find a stud inline with the other side of the gate, I have actually installed it at a slight angle without compromising the safety of the gate.Great quality product, several ways you can install to accomodate your needs. Instructions are complete and pictures detail very well. The gate can be opened with one hand, but utilizes a push-in-and-turn dial, similar to a child-safe medicine bottle."
77781,1,"We needed a monitor because I couldn't hear our daughter when she was upstairs and we were downstairs. It works GREAT! I can't believe how clearly I can hear her. I saw other reviews complain about the interference and wireless connections, I have always had a wireless connection for my laptop and our phones, and have never experienced any type of a problem."
15877,1,I purchased this item for my 6 month old and I love it. It replaces the need for a jacket and I can unzip the Bundleme when we are out shopping to keep my little one from getting too hot. I still put a hat on him when its very cold out but I do not have a problem with the wind blowing the top flap off (I have seen that complaint in other reviews) as my car seat has a canopy and that has never been an issue. The material is very soft on the inside and my baby is very comfortable in it. I would highly recommend this product.
132851,1,"I bought the Dekor system about a month ago after being a little fed a up with the size limitation of my old Munchkin. I like the simple design and I like the way the bags feed from a continuous piece of plastic, so I can actually remove the diapers anytime. Even though I was looking for something that held more than the Munchkin, as my son gets older (nearly 6 months old now) and starts eating some pureed food, sometimes I find I really need to empty the diaper pale IMMEDIATELY, if you know what I mean.My only criticism is that it gets smelly quickly - I liked that the Munchkin had a baking soda insert. Have to admit that I throw a little Carpet Fresh in this one after a few diapers go in. Makes the rest of the week smell a bit better. Anyway, it's not such a terrible thing, it actually just forces me to empty the darn thing more frequently.Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System"
18039,1,My twins (1 boy 1 girl) both love it! I lay it on the floor when Im making dinner and they lie there and just play !!or when Im cleaning its great or just for them to have a little fun ! buy it trust me its worth every penny
70673,1,"Great chair. I didn't buy it until my youngest was a year old he is now 18 months, and I am so sorry I didn't have it for my 1st son who is now 5. both of my kids use this chair. I wish I had a second chair."
76717,2,"I had such high hopes for this product, after realizing my son turned into a little fountain at every diaper change. Each individual tee-pee is quite small, and I find it hard to hold it over the right spot while doing the actual wiping and diaper changing at the same time. It just doesn't stay in place when you have a squirming baby. I find folding up a paper towel and putting it over him is just as effective and easier to handle."
165854,1,"This is a great amount of diapers especially for new borns and infants. I was worried that we wouldn't make it through all packs before her weight change to next up because we ordered a bit late, but the tape is stretchable so it's great. Pmpers is the brand that has only been working for my youngest currently."
154869,0,"We bought the miracle blanket about 2 weeks ago. Our 17 week old sleeps much better with it and we've been getting much more sleep ourselves.Over the weeks, though, she has learned that she can get her arms free by bringing her legs to her chest then thumping them down on the crib as hard as she can. I think this lifts her back enough that she can wriggle her arms free by repeatedly doing it.This morning we woke to find her arms completely out of the blanket, and the long outer flap wrapped around her neck. I had scary visions of her hurting or choking herself with it around her neck.As much as we like the product, we're not sure we will continue using it."
123394,1,"We took our 3 month old to a store to try out playyards. We placed him in several of the pack and plays with bassinets etc and he smiled and cooed at his parents. But when we placed him in this bright colorful play yard, he could not take his eyes off the toys on the sides of the unit. He was mesmerized. This play yard is very easy to setup, takes about 1 or 2 minutes to setup or break down. It's very stable and I love the way the floor mat locks down with velcro for extra stability."
22085,0,"I pump 2-3x a day in preparation to return to work. I use the medela 5 oz bottles that came with my pump since a) it is impossible for me to see how much milk I am pumping into the bag and b) because the oz measurements are different from what is on the bottle (ie, 1 oz in the bottle = 1.5-2 oz in the bag!), or any other bottle I use (ie, Avent). The seal is also cheap and it is difficult to know if it is completely sealed without tilting it and risking spilage. Medela should invest more money in improving their storage bags, especially considering the current cost. Add ziplock-like seals (blue+red=purple) to the bags to ensure that they are in fact sealed. Also, remove the expanding bottom. I think this is the measurement issue."
133810,1,This set is so beautiful - girlie and yet not frilly. We love it. Great quality too
133457,1,"I used Dr.Brown's before because my twins have reflux and gas. After reading about BPA I switched to Born free. My twins are 8 months old ( 6 months old corrected age), I was afraid about them adjusting to new nipple but they did really well on the first try. They are teething now, the new nipple is much softer and more comfortable for them. About cleaning, it doesn't bother me at all, for me it's easier than cleaning cleaning Dr.Brown's bottle because there is no tube. I love this bottle, I wish I found this sooner. Safe bottle, no leak, easy to travel with, easy with mixing formula and it fis my Avent bottle warmer."
148211,1,"This is the only toy, bouncer, or carrier my now 10 week old baby likes. He has been using it since about 5 weeks old and he just loves it more and more every day. He loves the moving little animals and the lights on the waterfall. The lights made it very useful for a young baby who was too young to play with toys yet. Now he sits there and ""talks"" to the animals. This is the only way I can get anything done around the house. BUY THIS!"
90256,1,"I am really happy with Pampers - we have used them since he was born. Each size works great, and the 'Baby Dry' diapers really work well for overnight. They are soaked in the morning - but contain the liquid well."
54390,1,"My son absolutely loves this mobile. I have put him in the crib and turned it on so I can do some chores, and he is entertained through all the songs, and even laughs as his favorite bird goes by. If you are purchasing this item so that your baby will sleep, then you might not be as happy with it. This item is for enterainment, and not for soothing your baby to sleep. Out of all the things I have gotten for my son, this was the best purchase. I have had no mechanical problems with it either, and the batteries have lasted the usual amount of time. :)"
57050,0,"I bought this to separate a dog and cat. It's installed at the bottom of a staircase. I like how it opens and locks and it's not too difficult to do it many times a day, but call my dog smart, he's figured out how to open this gate."
128175,1,"easy, folds great. safe, everything comes apart to clean.really a great buy for the $$$"
20168,2,Waste of money. The promise of no air and gas is simply a marketing trick. Feeding our twins with VentAire was a bad experience which was over as soon as we switched to Avent.
68829,1,"I love Pampers Cruisers. I have tried Pampers Dry Baby, Huggies, Luvs, White Cloud, etc. and by far Pampers Cruisers are the best!The elastic-like waistband really offers a snug fit that allows your baby/toddler to move and play. Amazingly the diapers are quite thin so there isn't a lot of bulk. Even after 13+ hours of sleeping my daughters have never had a leaking diaper or a diaper rash. With Luvs and White Cloud they developed a rash after 3 hours.I will never buy another brand or style again!"
175476,2,"This gate is garbage, too much hassle locking/unlocking. Better off to buy a tension lock gate, just as cheap and easier to lock."
58018,1,"I didnt have any problem about leak. The only think is that, as they said, colors may vary, and I received a pink one. I have a boy, and I'll have to give it to my niece."
50071,1,My 19 pound 6 month old and I both love this carrier. It feels almost exactly the same as when I hold her on my hip minus the tied up sore arms.
5644,1,"My son absolutely LOVES this faucet cover/bubble dispenser - it is adorable and makes great bubbles using less bubble solution. HOWEVER, be aware that in order for the item to fit over my faucet my boyfriend had to cut out most of the plastic inside and cut a notch into it for my shower diverter. BUT, after this minor adjustment, the elephant works and looks great and I am very happy I did not return it."
27358,1,"I purchased this to go along with the Dream on Me portable mattress for our Pack N Play. It fits great, very soft and washes great. I love this item and it is exactly what I was looking for."
166079,1,"My son has been wearing these diapers since we transitioned from Pampers Swaddlers around 9 months. The swaddlers were wonderful for when he was a newborn, but these definitely hold up better for an older baby. They are so super absorbent - we've never had a leak day or night.We transitioned him to size 4 Baby Dry diapers at night only starting around 9 months when he started to soak through his size 3 Swaddlers - often the front of his pjs would be damp after he had slept on his front in the night. I think because these have plastic coating on the outside, they don't soak through like the Swaddlers did (they were more cotton-like on the outside).I initially questioned whether to get the Pampers Cruisers for size 4 or the Baby Dry, but so far, I've had no complaints on these diapers after using them for 4 months!"
121557,2,"I bought it online because I wanted a small diaper pail that I can empty once a day or 2 days. Before this I owned Dekor Diaper Pail, which got rusty over 3 year use with my first kid. Safety 1st is just a cheap backet with a lid. Grocery bacgs are too small for this backet, lid does sit tightly which makes a really usless diaper pail or a trash can. Do yourself a favor, buy a regular garbage can if you want to safe money. It will look better and you can test it in so many stores instead of making a special trip to a baby store. Plus, regular trash can might cost you even less than this cheap piece of plastic. Oh, this pail will never hold any odor, for sure. By the way, Dekor does hold odor (not 100%) mainly due to an extra lid that is always closed and opens only when a dirty diaper is pressing on it. At some point I stopped buying refills and used regular 13 gallon trash bags."
93357,1,"We received a number of receiving blankets for our son's baby shower, including Carters, Wamsutta, and these. After 8 months these are still my favorites. The Wamsutta blankets (30"" square) were just too small, and the Carters blankets were cut odd - after a number of washings I noticed the corners no longer match up when I fold them, and they are nowhere near as soft as these Koala Baby blankets. I still use these for my 8 month old as a summer blanket (not swaddled) for naptimes and nighttimes. These are the softest receiving blankets we own, and the first ones I pull out of the drawer if we need a light cover for our little boy."
62730,0,"the diaper genie is easy to use, but my biggest complaint is that you have to buy the special liners for it and the liners do get expensive. it has lasted me through two children, but i can't think of a way to break something like this either. i found that the stage two liners are too thick and don't move as easily through the genie, so i use only the stage ones. i would recommend something like the diaper champ so you can use regular trash can liners."
73935,2,"ABSOLUTELY USELESS. This is what the item does: It tracks the time for last diaper change, last nap, and last time the baby was fed.These are absolutely useless because diaper changes need not be timed, it needs to be changed as often as needed anyways to prevent diaper rash; naps need not be timed - babies need naps most of the time anyways.And it only records the last time the baby was fed (which is probably the one single helpful thing this item does), BUT there is no way to track the MORE important stuff: how much the baby was fed, and how many has he taken so far for the day.I still ended up using pen and paper to communicate with the other people who help care for the baby.I hope the manufacturer can come up with a more useful item."
50497,1,"Pros:- Provides good support- Feels comfortable- Does not restrict blood flowCons:- You have to adjust to find the most comfortable position, sometimes it just doesn't feel right- The cover that came with it is so coarse. We have to wrap the whole thing with a blanket (or you can cough up and buy the additional cover)- Not necessarily a con, but this thing is big. Make sure your bed is big enough (for you and your other half)Warning: If you are allergic to polyester, you will feel it! I air fluffed the whole pillow in the dryer, then wrapped it with a blanket and some pillow covers. It worked fine for two weeks then the allergic stuff came out again. Well, air fluff again and re-wrap with washed blanket, etc. Working again.All in all, this is a must have for pregnant women. I subtracted one star mainly for the polyester allergen."
167933,0,"These are not the greatest. Because of the fact that they have velcro-type tabs on each side, they may as well be regular diapers. My daughter wants to put them on/take them off that way, rather than ""pulling up"" like training pants. A lot of day care centers prefer these because it's easier to change the child without taking their pants off, but I think they defeat the point. I've put my daughter to bed in these twice and they've leaked overnight both times. We've switched to the Pampers version now and we don't have the problem. I definitely prefer easy ups."
50650,1,"My wife had been complaining about not being able to sleep properly for a few days so I did some research on what alternatives were out there. I found the Snoogle to be one of the best options and bought it from Amazon. Sleep time has changed tremendously for my wife, who truly loves it and sleeps much better now. I also bought a navy blue cover for it, which I like and can wash easily but thought it was a bit expensive (almost half as much as the Snoogle pillow). Putting the cover on the Snoogle was a bit of a challenge the first time but by now, I'm a pro. I highly recommend the Snoogle for the sake of your wife's and baby's comfort and health."
19815,1,I was iffy about buying this because of the bad reviews but I think its great. It keeps sun and bugs out and it costs way less then others like it. I really dont know what all the complaints are about
137272,1,"I had the Peg Perego Aria travel system for my first child and decided to buy the Britax Companion carseat & Preview stroller for my second child. I love the shade coverage the Preview stroller provides when the Companion is attached to it -no sun whatsoever is on my baby! Great stroller, I just wish that it had a tray and I didn't have to remove the front bar padding to attach the infant carseat. There is not a console for my drinks; however, there is a ""diaper bag"" attached to the back of the stroller and I just put my drinks in the bottle holder or zippered pocket. I love that I can go shopping and put my bags on the handles and the stroller does not tip over! I have done this when my baby is not in the stroller and when she is in it."
163328,2,"We thought we could get a great product at an affordable rate and bypassed the higher-end lines and we decided on the Baby Trend Expedition Jogger/Infant seat travel system. At first pass it worked fine and we were pleased overall. Several weeks into owning the stroller we noticed that the front wheel became excessively shaky when not in the locked position. It was very difficult to maneuver with the wheel locked all the time, as we use the stroller for every day use.We called and were told to check and adjust the tire pressure. This didnt fix the problem and were told to try another fix, which also didnt work. When we called a third time it was suggested we ship the stroller back.After we finally found a box large enough to ship this stroller back, we shipped it in tact to Baby Trend to be repaired. Several weeks later I called and followed up and was told it would be returned within 10 days. We got home and opened the box to our surprise, our stroller had been shipped back unassembled! The issue we had was the unstable front wheel, and the wheels had been removed, negating the correction! Worse still, the screws and hardware we shipped in tact with our stroller had been removed AND NOT REPLACED! Baby Trend took apart our stroller and sent it back without the parts or means to put it back together!The footrest on the front of the stroller has no hardware for us to put it back on, and the tray that the car seat rests on has no screws and pulls out when touched, meaning the car seat CANNOT be placed in the stroller! If I hadnt pulled it out first, I could have put my child in the stroller and he would have fallen immediately out of it. How could this happen, how could they send a stroller back with no parts and with a blatant safety hazard, as though it hadnt been checked at all?Worst of all, they have told us simply that there is ""nothing they can do"" and they refuse to fix the problem. They tell us the parts are on backorder and they have 'no idea"" when they will be available. Meanwhile, I have no stroller and no means to get my 4 month old around. SO frustrating!! Totally unacceptable, we sent it WITH PARTS and they sent it back without parts, and won't rectify the situation. I have a stroller in my living room for a month that I simply cannot use. And they are fine to leave it that way, that we're just out of luck?? Its just wrong. Don't buy from this company, they DO NOT stand by their product. Check Consumer Affairs before you buy from them, I only wish we had."
182716,1,"Keeping my son dry during the potty training phase, these do the trick. This particular style seems to also run a little bigger than the other styles in the same brand/size range, making them easier on and off. Maybe just a fluke, but we like them."
44267,1,"This blanket is so soft and warm, perfect for a winter baby!!!"
129120,1,"We love this hamper! It has a removable mesh bag inside for easy trips to the laundry room, and a cloth cover that drapes over so you don't have to look at the dirty clothes all day. Plus, it matches the rest of our nursery theme!"
109984,2,I always read reviews and think that people are being over dramatic. But this product has really made me really take other peoples advice. This product is so hard to put together! The screws are too small for the holes required. The metal is cheap and the wood is as well. It took me two and a half hours to assemble!! My hands were hurting from forcing the screws into the holes! Don't buy unless you have time to get frustrated!
60095,1,"We got this tub when my son was 3 months old because he was getting too long for his infant tub. He is now 1 year old and still us using it! He loves it, he never freaked out in it, and was always very comfortable in it. Only had a few problems when he was little with him sliding around, but we just put a towel under his back and he was fine! Made it so it was only a 1 person job giving him a bath instead of 2 people! He loves his bath tub so much now! Figure we have at least 1 more year to use it with him! Totally worth the money!"
142999,1,"This is one of the best gifts we received for our twins! Both girls cried horribly when the cold wipes touched their bottoms. Which is horrible for those middle-of-the-night changes when you want to disturb them as little as possible. Grant you the wipes don't stay hot for very long but they do take the chill out. As for &quot;drying-out&quot; the wipes, the instructions say to add about 1/4 cup of water if needed, which works great. We've only had to add water once, and that was to a cheap brand of wipes that weren't very wet to begin with. I definately recommend this to mothers of multiples! I plan to buy another to keep downstairs (our nursery is on the second floor) for those in-between changes."
177580,0,It can be difficult to get started with this pump. Once you achieve letdown it's great but it can take 10-15 minutes to get there. DON'T freeze milk in these bottles - use a bag - they didn't seal properly and the milk went bad.
132948,0,"After my 2nd Diaper Genie lid broke off, my son was only 14 monts old, I figured - why buy another?? So I bought this. It is much better made then the Genie, but it doesn't even come close to containing the odor of a poopy diaper that the Genie did. I like the system ok, but if you can, dump the diaper in the toilet, then put it in the Dekor. And if you can't - put it in a grocery bag and throw it OUT. If you don't you'll be emptying the Dekor anyway. Do I think it is much better then a reg. diaper pail? NO. But at least the lid won't break off like the Genie. Hopefully my son only has about 8 more months in a diaper, I think I can deal with this until then. 2 lids aren't better then one, the odor still seeps out."
67537,1,"My 17-mo old -loves- this stool. She uses it mainly as a chair; she has a ""breakfast in bed"" table that she uses as a desk and with this little chair she can sit and color or read or make projects. It's durable, lovely color, very well-made. I purposely bought the natural one so that when she drew on it (which she already has), I won't worry about painting it. Stickers are easy to peel off of it (another big plus). And it's sturdy enough for me to use it as a step stool, so it will certainly grow with her."
152313,1,"A MUST HAVE!!We keep the unit on the side crib rail and the vibrator under the mattress. Plays music, nature sounds, or a heartbeat too. Can set to turn on automatically when baby cries. Works like a dream! We usually set it to the lowest setting vibration (she's 20lbs now) and the lowest volume for the music to turn on automatically if she cries. Calms her and puts her right back to sleep! Since it doesn't play every night, she's not 'addicted' and mom and dad don't need to get up to comfort her! We use this with the Summer Infant Handheld color monitor. Both work perfect; the monitor's camera is on the back crib rail at the center, about 16 inches from the crib vibrator controls and about 24"" from the vibrator itself. We have not experienced any problems with either. Both operate perfectly simultaneously; no interference. Baby has used since birth (pack and play had a vibrator - baby slept in bassinet / changing station for the first few wks and was gently rocked to sleep there; this was a great help tranistioning her to her crib!). Unit is almost a year old and well worth the few dollars. Here's to a good night's rest for all!!PS - our baby was not colicky, so I don't know if this will help your cause..."
71152,0,"I personally didn't care for this rocker. I was use to the traditional bouncy seat. So to go from a seat that bounces to one that rocks, I didn't like the transition. This would be good for an older child but not really an infant.The bouncing chairs bounced perfectly for what my daughter likes. It calmed her perfectly. Although in this rocker chair I couldn't calm her by rocking. It just wasn't soothing. I couldn't rock it smoothly. The colors aren't very pretty in my opinion either.I gave it a 3 to be fair. It was made nicely, a good contrsuction. I didn't feel it would fall apart. Overall, I just didn't care for it, and neither did my daughter. She preferred her bouncy seat. For us, it was a wasted purchase."
159518,1,"When the mommy opened this gift at her baby shower, a smile strctched from ear to ear just imagining her new baby in this new bouncer. Thee is so much going on here that the baby will be amused for hours on end. Excellent for colors and sounds. I highly recommend this fun and entertaining product."
33959,1,This is the perfect size. Not too big - not too small. I can fit four regular sized bottles or three wide bottles in here. I can also fit my breast-pump parts. Today at work I brought three Avent (wide) bottles and my Avent Isis Manual pump and was able to fit it all in this bag along with two ice packs. It kept my milk cool for 8 hours while I was at work. I never put it in the refrigerator and it works great! I kind of want another one. This will also be perfect when my little guy starts eating food. A great lunch bag!
111978,1,"WE HAVE USED THESE GATES FOR 6 YEARS. WE HAVE 5 OF THEM AND THEY HAVE ALL HELD UP BEAUTIFULLY AND OPERATE SMOOTHLY. THEY ARE JUST AS STURDY TODAY AS WHEN INSTALLED, ALTHOUGH WE DO CHECK FOR LOSE PARTS. ONE IS AT THE TOP OF OUR STEPS AND HAS GIVEN ME PEACE OF MIND FOR MANY YEARS. IT DOES REQUIRE THAT HARDWARE BE SCREWED INTO THE WALL OR BLOCKS OF WOOD CAN BE USED TO SECURE. IT IS DEFINATELY WORTH THE TIME TO INSTALL THIS GATE, BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO WORRY IF THE SAFETY GATE IS GOING TO WORK WHEN YOU NEED IT."
176893,1,"I love this product! I purchased it when my daughter was 4 weeks old after seeing it on a friends baby registry. (when I saw what it was, I bought two, one for her and one for me!) My husband and I were constantly trying new ways to keep the bottles we brought upstairs before we went to bed cold and then find the easiest(and quickest) way to warm them in the middle of the night without having to go back downstairs. Once we bought the day and night warmer, we simply placed it on my nightstand and the bottles were ready to warm when baby cried! I will admit that the whole water measuring thing doesn't work very well, but once you get used to it, you just know how long it takes. I just pour a little water in and once I hear it boil, I wait about a minute and the bottle is done! I had the Avent warmer downstairs and liked this warmer so much better (because it is much faster!) that I bought the First Years basic bottle warmer for downstairs and packed the Avent one away! There are two things you need to know before using...1. If you are warming a VentAire or Dr. Brown's bottle unscrewing the nipple is a must! The heat messes with the whole vaccum process and the milk will leak out the top while heating and 2. the steam heats the bottles fast, but I have burnt a finger or two with the steam while heating a bottle in my sleepy state during those early weeks! Also, I love VentAire bottles, but the warm water/steam from bottle warmers can get trapped in the bottoms of the bottles...just tip the ventaire's around a bit to make sure there is no hot water trapped up inside the vent that will burn baby. (this happens with VentAire's in any traditional warmer that involves water)Overall, this warmer/cooler saves me plenty of time (and sleep) during night feedings."
65109,1,My nearly 1 year old daughter loves this seat. I have it rear facing in a 2008 Rav4 and even fits front facing in a 2002 RSX coupe. It's slightly smaller size has worked out perfectly. Installation is easy with the LATCH system. I'll have to wait to see if the 40lb limit Vs. the Marathon's 65lb limit will make a difference. At that point I'm thinking a booster will suffice.
95266,0,"We tried this monitor briefly before moving on, and our biggest issue was the sound quality: it was not very loud, there was a constant background static humming with a louder sound every 1 second. The lights and two-way transmission are good, but we've found we don't really need them. We moved on to a F.P. 900 MHz vibrating monitor and are ecstatic -- much better sound quality, minimal background noise."
142843,1,"We purchased this for the bottom of our stairs. It fits perfectly into the stairwell, and my husband had no problems installing it. It is very sturdy, and stands up to my son rattling it constantly. It is easy to open and shut with one hand. My only issues are that my one cat can't fit through, so we have to make sure that the gate is open when we are not home. Also the little rubber stoppers left marks on the walls.But I would buy this gate again."
153956,1,These wipes have it all! You don't smell any alcohol. They are very soft for sensitive skin. They also hold up to sticky messes! I will never go back to regular store brand wipes.
151036,1,My girl was ready for a big girl booster seat and we wanted something more portable for our van. She picked this design. It's adorable and easy to use. Amazon shipped SUPER fast. Very happy with it.
153819,1,"These are the best wipes I have found for being gentle on the skin and no chemicals. They are thick enough to use for any clean up, hands, faces, restaurant table etc. I got them on sale so it was a fantastic deal. I will buy them again and again."
154813,1,"This is a great glider. The seat is comfy and wide enough to accomodate my breast friend pillow. Aside from the fact that one of the snaps is a little off so the arm rest cushion on one side is not snapped on the front (it stays in place just fine), assembly was easy. After only a couple days, my baby threw up all over me and the chair. After cleaning us up, I wiped the cushions off and used fabric cleaner to clean them. You can't even see where it was and it dried quickly enough to be ready for her next feeding. I highly recommend this chair."
63613,2,"you only have one strap that goes around the headrest. There's nothing to help you secure the pillows to the sides of the safety seat, which annoyed my toddlers to no end. They ended up batting it away, and never used it to sleep."
92501,0,This product worth for the money. But remember it does not do the bullet job. Good for the traveling or where ever you do not have electricity. Whenever you use it you need to separate all the parts and wash well because it has a lots of tiny areas which food remains in them (time consuming for a mom). You only can use soft foods like banana or well cooked fruits and always there is a left over piece which you can not grind it anymore so you need to use certain amount of food not small portion.
73051,1,"My son is now 10 months old (well, on Friday) and he has always been the one to catch the slightest cold.I have never been much of a germaphobe, I think its good to let kids get a little dirty, and a bit of dust doesnt bother me that much... My son is a premie, but he catches EVERYTHING, no matter HOW hard we try, and no matter how much we try to protect him. We never used an infant carrier, but have used the Floppy since he could sit upright (before that we used a carrier, like the Baby Bjorn).Its SO easy to travel with. It comes with its own ""bag"" thats easy to use, and you will NEVER loose it. I can put it on the cart with a baby on my hip, and I dont feel like I will drop him! It SECURES to the cart with straps, and also has straps for the baby. It covers THE WHOLE seating area, including the handle bars. Its soft, plush, and keeps the coldness, or hotness of the metal carts off my boy. It also makes the seating area a bit smaller, making it more comfortable for my premie. We love that you can put SMALL things in the little pocket (usually my keys or cell) and attatch toys and a binky to the strings. It also fits PERFECTLY on those disgusting restaurant highchairs, and adds more saftey since you are POSITIVE the floppy has straps, whether or not the highchair does, doesnt matter anymore. Its also machine washable, and dryer friendly... I recomend washing it after EACH use, just to make sure its cleaner.My son still catches wild ilnesses, but I have seen a major decline since the Floppy has come into the picture. Its also comfortable, and reasuring that my boy is safe and germ free... An item I recomend for ALL new moms."
94277,1,"I debated over which bottles to use for a long time and decided to give Avent a try. I have no regrets. My son is now 9 months old and still using the same bottles I started with. I have had no problems with leaking whatsoever. I'm just careful not to tighten them too tight, as previous posts suggest and have never had a bottle leak on me. They wash well in the dishwasher, although I prefer to wash them by hand. They're so easy to wash by hand - no intricate parts to remove or scrub. I only sterilize them once in a while in boiling water, it's not really necessary to buy the steamer that's recommended. I use the Avent pacifiers as well and have never had any problems or complaints with them."
57915,2,"This product does a great job of warming your babies' bottle, but it is very, very inconsistent. My wife and I have tried to experiment with it several times under exactly the same circumstances, with the bottle coming out at extrememly different temperatures each time. If the bottle is too hot, you have to cool it down (eliminating the time savings of having a bottle warmer), and if it doesn't heat it suffciently, the instructions state that you must wait 15 minutes to use the warmer again! Good for people who have to go downstairs at night to get\warm a bottle; for others, I question its' usefulness."
24549,1,"We've had our gate for almost 3 years and have not had a problem at all. We are pretty tough on the gate too, so I was surprised to read how the gate wasn't holding up in other households. Our toddler understands how to use the gate, but cannot put enough pressure on the pedal to open the gate. He weighs 28 pounds. We are getting ready to purchase another one right now!"
21402,1,"We have had this trampoline for exactly 2 months, and my 2 year old uses it everyday when watching his DVDs. This morning,however, the bungee cord broke while my son was jumping on it. My husband was able to stretch the longest part of the existing cord enough to fix it temporarily, but we have to get a replacement cord because my son loves this trampoline and uses it so much. Besides the broken bungee, this is probably the best gift my son has ever received! For a child who loves to bounce, this is a great toy to have around--especially on a rainy day!"
97070,1,This works just like i thought it would and will be ordering another one for my other little man as well
102209,1,"The cutest keepsake box. Has a flip-top lid which perfectly fits the matching record book, and has two drawers below that, one of which is divided into sections for smaller keepsakes. The bottom drawer is a good size to store the matching photo album too. On the lid is a frame for you to place a picture of your little one, that says ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls"" all around the frame. An excellent value, and it's very sturdy."
160970,0,"Ill shaped!!! Not big enough. Came apart at the top seam. Overall, not a good buy. Would not buy again."
7310,2,"This stuff is awful, it is way too runny. It's not moisturizing, nor does it have a pleasing smell. I bought a good amount of Mill Creek products and was sorely disappointed in most of them."
83357,0,"There is an album out there that I've purchased before and like much better, but this sufficed. The photo dividers weren't as impressive as they described. Wish I could remember where the other album was from."
148070,1,"It is very light, was easy to asesemble and my niece loves it! Very convinient, we can put it on a countertop and on the floor. seems like a thing for months to use."
25620,0,"It's OK but we only use it for water because it leaks more than a bottle. It's also quite heavy for my 11 month old to handle, even nearly empty. Also the plastic parts cannot be entirely removed. If you want to use it like a cup, there's a plastic ring around the edge. I recommend the Safe Sippy over this, by far. The Safe Sippy isn't insulated, but frankly my baby doesn't care about that."
64672,1,"These were all hits with my daughter between the ages of 3-8 months. Her favorite was ""Mr. Face"" which has a mirror on the back. You know you like a toy when you give it a name, right? The little soccer balls on him are good for teething and the balls inside were entertaining for her when she shook it. She liked the phone a lot, too around 3-4 months when she was putting EVERYTHING in her mouth. The butterfly and fish were less popular for her but we are pleased with the set as a whole.I find that overall Sassy puts a lot of thought into their toy design because they are very popular with my daughter. I don't know if it is the contrasting colors or what, but she really likes them."
105933,1,"We registered for the Diaper Champ when a friend of mine suggested it over the one she owned - the Diaper Genie. She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well. Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ. It is mindless to operate. It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode. It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon). And it is very easy to clean. I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple. I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning. I'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in. I am very pleased with our choice."
51718,2,"We were so excited to find a swing that actually plugs in so that we could save a lot of money not buying batteries. It was super cute, and my son LOVED swinging in it. However, the first disappointment was that even though there were supposed to be 6 different speeds, there was very little difference in each one. I have read the reviews that some found the high speed way too fast, but we found that even on high, the swing didn't move that much. The second disappointment was that after only a couple of months, the swing just stopped altogether. Fisher Price sent us 2 different motors (all free of charge--kudos to their customer service), but we had the same problem every time. The swing would just get slower and slower until it would completely stop. At this point, my son weighed 14 pounds, and it seemed that he was just too heavy for the swing to move him. However, the weight limit on the swing said 25 pounds, so it should have worked just fine. We ended up sending the swing back to Fisher Price and they sent us a full refund. I hope they can improve on these flaws by the time we have our next baby, because a plug-in swing is such an ideal invention."
39254,1,This was the *theme* chosen for my daughters room and I LOVE it. The colors are not outrageous and it is very nice looking on any color crib. I was able to match paint for her room and painted it two different colors and as she has now grown it still looks very cute and not babyish at all and she is 3. After my daughter was grown we hung this in her room in a corner and bought some paper butterflies to hang from the middle it is very cute.
85997,1,"Solve static issues by tying a knot in the camera power cord. Apparently this changes the frequency. I never write reviews, but read them all the time so felt it was time to give back. I have one of these monitors for my youngest and LOVE it. When my second was born I wanted another monitor - my only problem was that only one channel worked in my house. This is not a neighbor interference issue - we have no neighbors. I was reading reviews of other monitors when I came across the knot suggestion. I can't believe it but it worked beautifully. Now channel A works better that channel B ever did. Worth a try if you are having static trouble. Probably works on any monitor."
167343,1,"This car seat saved my daughter's life. We were in a horrible head -on collision and the Britax Marathon car seat saved her life. She sustained no injuries, not even a scratch.Now, with a second child, I have purchased a second Britax Marathon because I know this product will deliver safety. I do recommend that if you have doubts about installation to check out the Britax installation on-line videos or make an appointment at you local fire station for proper positioning. The other good thing about this car seat is that it is made in the USA."
7204,1,Both of my boys (3 and 19 months) love their Cooshie boosters. They seem to be really comfortable and stay put in our dinning room chairs. I love them because they are easy to clean and keep looking like new!
133756,1,"We're very happy with this product. I'm able to clean up with one wipe, on occasion I need to use a second one. We've had no problem with the container as stated in another post. I like that I can add-in a new refill before all the wipes are gone. It's makes it nice so I don't have to do refills in the middle of the night. Finally, I like these because they are soft, durable, and wet but not sopping. I first tried the Huggies and they had so much liquid that there was a puddle in the bottom of the container. Pampers are just right."
141720,1,My nine month old loves this toy...hasn't really used it to help walk yet but she stands and plays all the time with it!Good BUY
184604,1,"The sheet is very soft, washes well, and fits perfectly on the mattress. I also like that it has elastic all the way around the sheet, instead of just on the ends.The reason I gave it ""four stars"" was because when I put it with my other ""Ecru"" bedding set, the sheet turned very ""yellow"". In the store it looked ""ecru"", but when I got it home it was very ""yellow"", which is a color I'm not very fond of. I brought it back to the store to see if maybe the color was mis-marked, but when I held it up to other ""ecru"" brand sheets it also looked ""yellow"".Anyway, I have yet to find any sheets as nice as these...So I guess my daughter will just have to live with an ""ecru"" and ""yellow"" room!!!"
145256,1,"I love the rainforest jumperoo!! I got it just a few days after ordering. Very easy to set up. My daughter has been using this for a month now. She is now four months. It has a great head support. Very bright, colorful and just super cute! My daughter has loved it since day one!!"
29299,1,"serves its purpose, my son loves it. Makes washing hands and brushing teeth so much easier! I recommend this one plus the non slip surface is great when water gets splashed"
12399,2,"I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them. If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up. Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean. Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better."
29802,1,"My Husband wanted a more masculine bag, so we registered for this one. Is he ever happy, it can carry everything he thinks he needs and then some for our little one. It's also great for mom's on the go in the business world as it matches the attire we are required to wear. This is the perfect, durable bag for anyone starting their family. No doubt it will still be around to use for child #2. A GOTTA HAVE IT!!!!"
138044,1,"This is a fantastic idea for any kid who has trouble falling asleep or needs some help relaxing at bedtime. The twilight turtle is great because it gives kids something to look at rather than just being a standard nightlight. You get to choose from 3 colors, personally I think the blue is the most soothing. I love the little book that comes with it to help kids learn the different constellations. Here's a video to give a bit of an idea of how it looks when on and the narrator is kind of awesome."
34745,0,"I bought this car seat for my 6 month old, who is almost too big for the infant carrier. Thought it had great features and because it went up to 100 lbs that it would save me money eventually but when I went to install it in my Chevy Tahoe the problems began. First, I have been installing car seats for 12 years and I thought I had this one belted in great until I went around a corner and the seat rocked over about 6 inches! In my truck, the carseat sits almost vertical, even when fully reclined as is required to be for his age/weight. His little head flopped forward when he went to sleep!! It's going back today and I'm getting something else. My advice, don't buy ANY carseat until you try it in your vehicle!"
73256,0,"This was my absolute fave baby item, until it just started blanking out. Six months after we started using it, it just goes out, as if the batteries are dead... but they aren't. Then I have to take the batteries out and put them back in for it to start up again (plus reset the timers and clock). It started out once or twice a day, but now it's five or six times a day."
67614,1,"My son LOVES his cars, but they were starting to take over his floor space. This mat is perfect. When he's done playing we can just scoop all the toys to the middle and fold it up, takes 30 seconds or less! I only wish it were a little bigger (the picture made me think bigger; it's a decent size still), but we haven't even reached max capacity yet!"
50464,1,I bought this for my wife who's pregnant and she absolutely loves it! She can sleep on her side and still have the support she needs.
7469,1,"While your child is in an infant seat, this is the best stroller there is. Forget travel systems. They stink by comparison.The basket is pretty decent size, it has drink holders for you, what's not to love. It is very maneuverable and lightweight.I know Baby Bargains doesnt recommend it, but they were on crack when they wrote that section. There is nothing else that holds a candle to this while your child is in an infant carrier.if you are locking yourself in the house for the first 6 months of your child's life then yeah, don't buy this."
127952,1,This is a great bottle brush. I have bought four in the past year. Both my daughters loved it and I gave 2 for baby presents. It does a great job and I love the nipple brush that is inside the handle.
139660,1,Its soft enough for my son to sleep with and bright enough for a tall ceiling. Very happy with this purchase!
115709,2,"I had to sell this stroller after one use because I kicked the wheels probably a dozen times. Very VERY disappointing because I love the color and style! I'm only 5'6"" so if you're a petite person and not planning on any tall people using it then it may work out just fine for you. Or I suppose if you are a ""baby steps"" type of walker, but I take long strides. Wish the handles were adjustable- they needed to be an extra 3-4 inches higher."
16532,1,"This bib is absolutely gorgeous. I received this item at my baby shower, after putting it on my registry, thinking it was overpriced and never thinking anyone would pay this money. Well I received two bibs and a set of burp cloths and I can't wait to use them. I'm going to buy some myself."
44525,1,The bag was a big hit at the baby shower! My friend loves the fact that it doesn't look like a diaper bag but still functions like one.
23568,0,Not wide enough. The two extensions are there for a reason. I am in the process to buy two more extensions.
86163,1,I just got this item for my two story house. I was able to see the crib from the upstairs nursery throughout my house and even outside. The monitor is not in color so that is misleading but the picture looks great
7031,1,I bought this item with the 30$ off for 100$ pampers coupon. I like and have been using Pampers for my daughter for long time.
24455,1,"This gate is GREAT for PETS and KIDS. We bought two of thesegates for our daughter when she was a toddler and now use it to keep our dog in the kitchen while we are away or during the night. It has been in place for over a year now, and gets a TON of use. It loosens up from time to time, but it is no big deal to tighten it (my 8 year old son likes to swing in the opening). We currently have 2 extensions on it, and have had no problem with them other than when we first got our Italian Greyhound he could get through the gate on the extension side, once he got bigger this wasn't a problem. Our 3 1/2 year old still doesn't have the strength to open the gate on her own (she weighs 30 pounds) so it keeps her out of the kitchen while I am cooking dinner. I only wish they could make slightly wider extensions so I could place a third one between my dining room and living room, for now I have a tall step over kind of gate there."
39248,0,I ordered this online without seeing it in person & was disappointed in the colors. I did not realize there was a checkered black patter in it & did not find the red vibrant enough but it I thought the quality was very good. I decided to pick another set though
84945,0,"This was the first product I bought from Bliss and it was somewhat of a disappointment. The product bottle states that it is ""Bubbling"" Bath and Shower Gel. That was certainly an overstatement as there were very few bubbles in the bath. If you want a true bubble bath look elsewhere. The smell is pleasant enough but there are many bath and shower gels I own which are a lot creamier and smell a lot better. It all depends on one's preference."
168726,1,We used other brands (Huggies) before for our first son but it wasn't as good as I expected. It also left some white stuff on the baby after each use. So we changed to Pamper's and really satisfied. And now we have 2nd baby girl this year we used Pampers swaddlers ever since she was born and of course we really like how it keeps the baby dry.Highly recommend this product.
110311,1,"after searching for months and read all the reviews for this Glider and other i descided to buy the Shermag. It is very comfortable and soft and rocks very smoothly.the quality is very good. the cushen is thick enough. the assembly was very easy. the only thing that i didn't like is that the chair is very narrow so there is not so much room, but overal I'm happy with my purchase."
105747,1,"We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product- the ability to use any garbage bag as opposed to diaper genie bags. After all as new parents, we don't really have the luxury of time- secondly, my sister-in-law had the diaper genie and although it does seal odors, the bag tends to unravel when you put the diapers in it. The Diaper champ ALSO seals odours and the regular garbage bags are sturdier.- Finally, I looked at the instructions to assemble both products and the diaper champ is a lot easier (ok, so we're talking about relatively easy items to assemble, but even so, the diaper champ is easier to assemble)"
29187,0,"First, the product I received is not in the same color as pictured. It is a combination of blue (body) and red (top and rubber feet).Second, the product dimensions in the description are misleading. They are not true to the actual sizes. It's actually 11.5""L x 8""W on the top, and 6"" deep. The product is smaller than described even when measured from the widest points, which is 13""L x 9""W.The product itself is in good quality. However, it is too short for little kids to reach the toilet. If it were 8"" deep as described, it would be much better."
105207,1,"I switched from the Genie to the Champ to avoid having to buy the cartridges. I like the flip over handle more than the twisting of the Genie. BUT about 5 minutes after I put it on the floor my two toddlers figured out you can put things in the hole and make them disappear!!! Not fun to go digging among diapers to retrieve toys, blocks, etc.I don't regret buying it - I still prefer it to the Genie."
168633,1,Diapers are diapers are diapers! No complaints. Kept the stinkies in and held up to my daughters heavy wetting at night.
160720,0,"We had 2 Ultimate Crib Sheets and loved them. We've used them every night in our child's crib for over 2 years now. Now that she's bigger, and leaking almost every night, we needed another UCS. We still use the old 2 sheets. I LOVE that we don't have to take the mattress out to change the sheets when her diaper leaks. It's so much easier and faster with the UCS. My review for the old design would have been 5.The Amazon picture shows the old design. The old design had 8 straps - 3 on each of the long sides (close to the corners and in the middle) and 1 on each of the ends. The straps on the short ends were located in the middle and were completely detachable (why, I don't know). They were a little long so we had to wrap the strap around the crib rung a couple times before snapping. It wasn't perfect but still pretty good.This new design is terrible in terms of the elastic strap/snap placements. This new model has straps in each of the corners (with a snap on the left and right of the strap for different rung placements. It also has 2 straps on each of the long sides. There's no strap on the ends. In theory, this design should be great. But the corner straps are way too short to fit around the crib corner posts (which are at least triple in size than regular rungs). You can get one of the end's corners done, but not the other end's corners. So to get it to fit, we had to do one end on the corner posts (which made the pad a little long on that side) and on the other end, the corner straps were attached to the side rungs closest to the corners. Thus, there's a 2-3 inch gap that the sheet doesn't cover.Keep in mind that the UCS shrinks in time if you wash them the way we do. The waterproof fabric on the bottom tightens up after washings. Granted, we wash in hot and dry normally, along with our other whites. I think you're supposed to wash in warm per the instructions. With the old design, it's not that much of a problem. Not sure how the new design will do.Other thoughts: The fabric is soft. My daughter has very sensitive skin, and the fabric is fine for her. We have white UCS's and they haven't yellowed and all the urine stains come out (again, we wash in hot)."
3917,1,"I will not lie, I am the type of person that I like everything to match whether its by color or brand name. I purchased this item for my Maclaren Triumph stroller and all I wish is that it were a bit larger, it was quite small. I mean I didnt want a huge bag, but something a little bigger would've been better, its about the size of a Medium Dominoe's Pizza box. The drink holders are mesh so unless you have a bottle, the holder might not be as durable as one would like. It does look nice and I love the material."
2038,1,"I have recently switched to cloth diapers but if i had to go back to disposables it would break my heart because I love Pampers baby drys! These diapers worked wonderful for my son. No rashes, no leaks, they lasted over night (12+ hours!) and we never had blow outs. His diapers did busted on us a few times but that was our fault for having him in a size to small. These are my first pick when it comes to disposables!"
36123,0,"I didn't find it comfortable compared to the Ergo or more expensive carriers; however, I was able to use it at the mall once. I think that these are better for newborns. My child was about 11-12lbs when I used it and I found her a bit too big for it."
68821,1,"These diapers are the best I've used. Even Consumer Reports liked them the best. The price is about $2.50 less than our local Wal-Mart. With the free shipping when you buy 4 packs, you save $10.00. When you go through diapers like most people, this sure saves alot on a top-notch product."
99499,0,"even though they're both made my pampers. While I really did love pampers, Luvs doesn't have the scent that pampers does. I don't know. And luvs is SO much cheaper."
15755,1,We bought this for our son as it gets really cold in Chicago. The toddler size fits our son perfect and he has fallen asleep in it on more than one occassion as he ges snuggled in toasty warm. It fit our Chicco stroller with no troubles. A+
18575,1,Everyone in my family uses this sunscreen. It rubs in easily and isn't greasy at all. Great protection overall and no harsh chemicals!
37974,0,"Product in it's entirety didn't seem to have as many animals on it as appears in the advertising pictures. Half of the crib-liner had blue/white pattern instead of animals. Diaper bag had one animal on it. I guess I was expecting more animals. The only thing I really liked about this product was the blanket, which is full of cute animals. If only they had made the rest like that."
25561,2,"When we started cloth diapering, getting flushable liners was a must for us. We first used Grovia liners. I tried switching to these as they were a little cheaper. Sometimes you get what you pay for. These bunched up and did not do a good job of catching all of the waste. They are much thinner and flimsier than the Grovia liners. We didn't even use them all up before we ended up buying some more Grovia liners. We are pretty much done with diapering, so I have not done anymore research to find an alternative. I would definitely not recommend these, though."
111402,1,"Very simple installation. Did have to really cram the larger power strip cord in though. It's doing it's job, my baby considers the cord invisible. Thank goodness"
41112,1,These fit realy well and are a ton better than Luvs. Def worth the price.
122676,1,"these are pretty expensive, but worth the money.Soft, absorbant, no itchy tags..."
179073,0,"I really like these bottles. However, the nipples that came with them didn't work. My baby (now 3 months old) would suck and suck and nothing came out. I even tried the stage 2 nipple and the same thing happened--nothing! I usually use the Dr. Brown's bottles (which I absolutely love) so I tried the ventaire bottle with a Dr. Brown's nipple and it worked just fine. I never figured out what the problem was with the playtex nipples."
62009,1,"I switched to the Pampers Easy Ups trying to save some money after buying months of Pull Ups. These do the job, but are a little narrow in the width. My son's little bottom is barely covered and he is always pulling and tugging at the edge (he is an average sized 3 year old). We just use them for training during naptime and bedtime, so I will continue to buy them for that purpose. If he was wearing them during the day, I would go back to Pull Ups."
105168,1,"When I found out I was pregnant, I ran right out and bought a Diaper Genie. However, after reading online reviews, the Diaper Champ seemed to receive better reviews...so, I exchanged my Diaper Genie for a Diaper Champ. Boy, am I glad I did!! No special refills to buy (I use plain old 13 gal. kitchen bags), and changing the bag is so easy! Easy to use, and I have had no trouble whatsoever with the Diaper Champ smelling at all! I highly recommend this product to all mommies - It's the best!!!"
176091,1,la calidad de la tela es increible y el color tambien. no han cambiando en ningun sentido con el uso. combina excatamente con las tonalidades del corral.
60588,1,"I bought this tub because my baby was getting too big for her pink one. Ths tub is big enough for kids up to 2 years old, has very well-placed leg braces for a one-year-old. Before getting the tub, she would keep trying to crawl out of it. Now, she happily plays with her floating toys in it. Easy to clean. My other pink SureComfort tub did not drain when I pulled the plug. This one drains fast. Awesome big white tub."
159016,1,"I'm always satisfied with J&J products, especially with the classic baby powder. Even though it's primarily used for babies, I also used it myself. I tried it out after a shower. The powder had a light, clean scent (reminds me of a newborn) and went on smoothly and softly. Made me feel as if I had baby skin myself. The white powder dissolved easily into the skin and didn't cake up like some powders do. Overall, I would most likely recommend this product to friends and family."
141917,2,"I tried this on my son's crib, but it did not stick. I have an Oeuf crib, with straight bars that are finished with non-toxi paint, but I can't imagine that would make a difference. I would highly recommend not purchasing this."
7464,0,"a great purchase if you are careful. It is very lightweight and so easy to just snap the infant car carrier into and out of it with minimal disturbance to the sleeping baby. This is a must have while during the infant carrier seat stage. There is a great amount of storage space below. However- 2 issues- putting it together is a bit frustrating, but it can be accomplished.Most of a concern is that the graco snugride does not actually SNAP securely into it. It simply lays over the bars creating a real hazard for the seat falling off. BUT, there are straps on the snap n' go to hold the car seat onto it. It is just not too tight, safe or securely in place one you snap the seat on and buckle the straps. Just use the belt strap and keep it real tight to try and create your own tension. Otherwise do NOT use this product. It can be very dangerous to the baby. We actually thought we installed it wrong in disbelief that this stroller can fail to be secure especially with the word ""snap""- it truly does not snap, it more ""rests upon"". With that issue aside, used correctly and cautiously it is a great item for convience and lightweightedness."
58724,1,"My husband and myself were completely on our own for most of the beginning of our son's life. We got no sleep and hardly even had time to eat. After a day or two of boiling water to sterilize the nipples and the breast pump parts, we couldn't stand waiting for the water to boil every time. So I had my husband run out and get this microwave sterilizer. It saved us. The nipples and rings and breast pump parts all fit perfectly and it was so simple and fast to use. We both loved it and recommend it to anyone we ever talk to who is pregnant."
161513,2,"DO NOT BUY THIS THING!!!! Unless you want water everywhere. I returned one thinking it was broken, but the second one leak eveywhere as well, that one went back too. It is a great size for the baby but not worth the hassel. The kitchen sink is much better."
180213,1,"I didn't realise how awful my evenflo electric pump was 'til I used this one. Where the evenflo was painful and annoying to use, this little hand held manual pump is easy to use, painless because I control how hard and fast it pulls, does not sound like a dying cow (virtually silent), has less parts and does a MUCH better job. It feels very similar to my baby's suckling and as a result my milk will let down sometimes 3 times during a single pumping. :)To sum it up--It's fast, easy and effecient. I plan to take it with me in my diaper bag for whenever I need it.I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a breast pump."
163092,2,"For a newborn, you can't go wrong. However, once a little one can pull to standing, this pail is a hazard. There's no latching mechanism so interested toddlers can get into the pail (BLECH!!!!) It's also the least stable pail I've used (I'm an Infant Teacher/Caregiver in a preschool) so IF a little one pulls up while nearby, both the child and the pail can topple. I'm really careful, but if I'm changing two babies consecutively, the one NOT on the table will often TRY to get into it... if you have a toddler (or two), go for something more sturdy like the genie, champ or dekor..."
74627,0,Walker is too tall for my 6-month old baby who is willing to start to walk. The lowest setting for this walker is too tall yet.My baby is already 26 inches tall.
25041,1,It is such a convenient gate. Very sturdy. A 5 year old can barely open it even if they know how. LOVE IT
37406,1,"This bag fits the Teutonia stroller if you detach the wheels from the base (which is really easy). You'll need to cover the pins on the base with something so they don't tear the bag. Our bag has three small tears after one trip, but the bag was subjected to the Boston baggage handlers twice so I'm not ready to blame the bag. The stroller base and the toddler seat fits with some room to spare. It's a lumpy shape, unlike the picture but it kept the stroller clean."
104767,1,"I purchased this product for my son, he was previously in a graco infant car seat which he couldnt stand being in. The visibility is better in this one. If I had known earlier, I would have started him in this convertible one."
103019,2,"My son needed a chair to sit in otherwise he would not eat, so I bought this chair when we were visiting the grandparents. The chair is adequate but unless I pick a faulty one I find the tray very difficult to get on and off, the plactic levers are very small for those with arthritis. I don't know if there are any chairs that are better."
37889,1,It has enough items needed for baby. it needs a better pacifier for you to put the medicine in for the baby to take and a softer noise syringe in order to use it for suction of the nose
78647,1,"I only travel once a year to visit my family in Mexico. But to be honest I have not experienced a good trip since my 1rst child was born. Nobody told me how difficult it can be to travel with children. I used to bring a stroller to the airport and place the car seat and my daughter on top. Then I realized I looked ridiculous!. One time I noticed someone using one of those car seats with wheels. She was standing next to me and I had my daughter sitting on her car seat attachted to a 10$ stroller!. That maked me realized there's new thecnology out there. So I decided to go online and check the different options to travel around with my daughter. When I find out about the prices I went dead.Then I discovered this product. Is very economic and practicle. I did not believe at first but once I had it at home I try it on my suit cases. Is only good for small ones. So, if you are planning to bring one small case that's fine (you can always check the other ones at the gate). The only inconvinience is when you have to go trough the check point and need to remove the car seat and put it on the band. But once you know the trick everything goes fatser. I am very pleased with this product. For people who only travels a few times per year and is cheap like me, its just perfect."
85469,1,"At 2 weeks old my baby's face started breaking out in a red rash on her cheeks and forehead. The pediatrician recommended we apply some Aveeno baby lotion but this aggravated the situation. I tried Aquaphor following a friend's advice and it worked wonders. Overnight, the rash completely disappeared and her face was clear and soft! Since then I've used Aquaphor healing ointment to get rid of cradle cap, diaper rash, irritated skin in her neck, armpits, and other areas that can become rashy when moisture is trapped in folds. I use the normal Aquaphor ointment (not Baby) but after checking the ingredients, the formula seems to be the same. The ointment is thick and can be sticky when first applied, but you only need a very thin application to do the trick and the product is absorbed quickly, leaving behind the softest baby skin possible! One of my favorite products for baby, with fast results."
160859,1,"We like it. big enough for anything you want to put in this bag. We love the pockets in the front for bottles or spoons, or whatever! One thing I would change if I was to buy this again is a different color. You can see where mine has been unfortunately."
737,1,I'm still considered a new mom I only have one toddler she is 2 years old. I only order her diapers online now. I have gone to the stores in my town and her size is always always always sold out but with amazon her size is always here and here. I'm also amazon prime and I ger her diapers in 2 days after I order them. I love it that hold everything and more. I have told friends this is the only way I will ever order her diapers.
99275,1,"Great product and even better price. If you compare to Costco, Target, etc. you will not find a deal better than this."
110060,0,"It was great when we first brought it home. We loved that it sat up high so that our 12 month old could see out the window and that we could easily recline the seat while we were driving. This is one of the only car seats on the market that has this feature. A car seat inspector also said that it was a good, safe car seat.After a month or two, the slider for the reline was hard and and harder to pull. Then the straps in the back/inside got all mangled all of the sudden and we had to unscrew it all to get the straps right again. Luckily we bought it from Babies R Us so they took it back.Other cons:-agree with others cheep fabric-it is massive, tight fit for most cars!!!-not a convertable seat.I would instead recommend the Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat in Matrix which we have had for several months and we love it! You get more bang for your buck too because it is convertable."
34375,1,Love this diaper cream and that it's all natural! The price per ounce is the best on here. Received very quickly!
1022,2,"The price was nice but the performance is lacking. Our son can soak one of these full in a few hours and has more leaks with these. We don't dare use these overnight and just use them during the day (We use Huggies Snug & Dry Size 3 at night). Even during daytime use, he still will leak once in a while with these. It might be partly a sizing issue since these are larger than the equivalent 3 in the Huggies. We won't be getting these again after this pack runs out."
94315,1,I've had this set since my daughter was born 11 months ago and have never had a problem. The bottles are very high quality and well worth the extra $$.
37620,0,"The wipes are fine-sensitive enough for a newborn. The problem was that I received a case of over 800 wipes in october and the expiration date on the package was december. Amazon was not able to accept a return since the package had been opened, but amazon did refund $10 which was 1/3 of the purchase price."
10501,1,"I use this ""Creamy Baby Oil"" as a hair conditioner for my daughter's hair. It woks great!"
159037,0,"Our 3 1/2-old daughter loves the design, softness and concept, but can't quite keep it in a right position when she falls asleep... I wish there were some sort of strap that can be attached to car seat to keep it in position."
24458,0,"We've used this gate non-stop for the past 10 months between our kitchen and living room. It gets a lot of use. When it worked it was awesome. We loved being able to get in and out hands-free. It installs easily, but the problem is its not very durable. After about 9 months the latch mechanism operated by the foot-pedal inside the one upright broke. The foot-pedal no longer activates the latch.We contacted the manufacturer but the warranty is only good for one year from date of purchase. Since most (including ours) are purchased as shower gifts and not used until the child is mobile, the warranty will mostly be void within a few months of installing it. Because of that you might want to put off the purchase of this gate until you need it, instead of getting it early as a gift.The manufacturer further stated that this cannot be repaired and our only recourse was to buy a new one. Not exactly comforting for a ~$60 gate. At this point we probably won't buy another one, although if they changed the design to make it more durable (or repairable) or offered a longer warranty, we'd probably consider it."
26454,1,"We love this bassinet, it's comfortable for our newborn, it's beautiful and well made. I see the potential hassard that others are writing about with the bassinet not locking very well in place and now a baby can roll to the side but that's why we bought wedges that keep her on her back and prevent her from rolling. I think that's a potential risk in any bassinet that rocks and everyone should have the wedge's regardless since it helps prevent SIDS. We really love this bassinet though, and highly recommend it."
74215,2,"I just bought this stroller because my 4 year old didn't like walking to and from school and I also have a 2 yr old. I am mostly disappointed with how hard it is to steer when both kids are in it- it just makes it too heavy to steer and just hard to push in general. Every driveway that dips and every turn takes huge effort- I find I have to ask my 4 year old to get off when we need to turn or go up our slight hill to our street. I'm also disappointed with how small the front seat is. My 2yr old hardly fits. It is a very shallow seat with a short footrest. My son's feet hang down beyond the footrest by at least 3 inches. And lastly, the detail I find annoying is how small the cup holders are on the front tray- way to small to hold any modern sippy cup or water bottle. The size of the cup holder seems to be designed for a bottle. Perhaps this stroller would work for younger kids, or for someone just using it in a mall type environment, but for kids that are a little older or use on sidewalks I really don't reccomend it. I plan to buy something else."
106859,1,"Not knowing the difference between diaper pales, I bought this one.Pros:Easy to cleanUses regular garbage bagsCompactLocking mechanismInexpensiveCons:Diapers can get stuck if trying to put too much in or if full. Not a real issue to me."
160947,0,"I liked the idea of having a messenger-style diaper bag as opposed to the more prevalent tote-styles. The Diaper Dude bag is ok, but there are a few items that would make it better for my needs.My biggest wish is that the main compartment were larger. It's fairly small and when we put in all the things we'd like to carry, the bag gets stuffed and becomes somewhat misshapen to the point where it lays awkward on my hip and back. I tend to carry portable wipes, 4-5 diapers, 1-2 change of clothes, a hat, a blanket, a sippy cup, a snack trap, a couple of toys, my cell phone and keys. Because I can't find a place for everything, the main inside compartment is a mishmash of unorganized items.The cell phone holder does a fine job holding my LG flip phone. A bigger phone however wouldn't fit, but $15 for a Timbuk2 cell phone case would solve that. Also, the elasticized bottle pocket is pretty snug so getting a bottle in and out is kinda tough. On the other hand, the bottle doesn't fall out accidentally.Additionally, the dirty diaper pocket in the large compartment should probably have a zipper to keep the smell out of the other items in the bag and avoid cross contamination. The hooks for keys and pacifiers would probably only hold keys. The pacifiers being sold these days aren't on a ring and are much too big to be hooked onto the bag. The included changing pad is padded nicely though.Overall, it's a decent bag, especially at Amazon.com prices. Someone in our play group has complimented me twice on the bag so I may just give it away to them or keep it as a backup bag. I recently ordered a DadGear messenger diaper bag for nearly the same price and am hoping that it holds all my items better."
150612,0,"I bought this stroller last summer. It is good for what I need it for. However, if you have to make any turns you don't want this one. I wish it had a wheel that would turn in the front. Other than that, no complaints."
113722,1,I bought this 3 years ago and its so awesome im coming back to leave a review now. This is the BEST highchair/ booster seat ever made. You can strap this thing to a rock and you baby will be ready to grub in 2 minutes flat. If your thinking about buying this DO IT NOW!!I am on child #2 and this thing has never let me down. Fisher Price has outdone themselves on this one.
53865,1,"I bought his for my 4 year old son so that he could color and work puzzles. He loves it and uses it often. It was easy to put together, and we have enjoyed the product!"
101642,2,"I was so excited to find this product. I have two children under 2 years of age and really wanted a monitor with two base units - and this one has three! I purchased it thinking it would be worth the hefty price tag, but unfortunately I was wrong.This monitor had a constant static-y hum and would periodically crackle loudly, which was very annoying compared to the monitor I used to have that was completely silent. I might have been willing to deal with that except I could barely hear my children even with the volume turned all the way up. I was used to hearing my son breathing over our old monitor, but with this one I could only hear him well if he was crying loudly. I couldn't believe how low the maximum volume was!This monitor was definitely not worth the price considering the poor quality - it was almost worthless! I returned it and am going to try using two different monitors instead."
168777,2,"It happened twice already after one week's use of this, poopoo leaks from the behind and messes up the bed.It never happened before with other pampers or huggies."
102813,1,"My child is now 20 months and we have two. I'm pleased with them both, one downstairs and one up. When your child is younger you need to empty it regularly. When you child is older it's best to empty what you can in the toliet. When you put the stinky stuff in the toliet and the diaper in the pail, it will not smell. Anything too messy for the toliet goes in a plastic bag and outside."
148323,0,i didn't realize how little these were. i have them in both bathrooms for my granddaughter who is 18 mo old. she does use them but does have difficulty getting up afterwards. i am trying to figure out how to prop them up so it will be easier for her. i bought the larger one which is great but i gave it to her parents
93799,1,"I have a very odd opening between my kitchen and family room and I have 2 very rough toddlers! This gate fit perfectly between the opening and because of it's height, my little ones can not climb over or open it, unlike the other gates that we tried. I also love it because my 8 year old can't step over it either. It is very easy to open and easily comes off the wall to store away. It only took a few minutes to install and is great because it pushes together against the wall. Like I said before if it can keep out my 2 toddlers it has to be AWESOME!!!"
98668,1,"I love this car seat, but it is so heavy and difficult to install. I did not realize how big it was when we ordered it. It is very comfortable and my son loves it!"
21434,1,"I am a big fan of this product. The kids love it, I have had children as young as 8 months jumping on this all the way to 8 year old's. This is the one toy in my daycare that gets used everyday, without question. A few things I did not know about the product before buying it:- Putting it together takes 2 people and a bunch of patience.- The metal connections of the frame will start to rip your bungee cord. Once I noticed what was happening I cut some strips of fabric and wrapped and tied it around the cracks in the metal frame where the pieces of metal met. This has given the bungee cord a smooth surface and slowed the friction and ripping of the cord. Wish I would have done this from the start.- The handle of the trampoline does NOT fold down. The legs are really easy to fold, but the handle you have to unscrew. Mine is a tight fit and not easy to get back on as easily. Not the quick storage I thought it would be but to be honest, the kids are not happy when it gets put away so I have not really stored it for breaks like I thought I would anyway.Overall, I love this product and am really glad we bought it. I watched the price on Amazon for almost a year before buying it and was thrilled when it went under $40 close to Black Friday in 2011. We have been using it for over a year and it has held up well with the exception of the cord ripping mentioned above."
167128,1,I love this cart cover! It has kept my daughter for chewing on the cart. She is currently teething and loves to chew on everything. We have recieved several compliments as we make our way through the grocery store. I have not tried to use this as a high chair cover yet simply because we do not go out to eat that often. It does appear as if it would be awfully bulky but I am willing to give it a try.
123742,0,"WHen you place the baby on his back to look at the bird, the bird is too close to the baby's face to be seen. I think it made him feel closed in as well. It was a cute idea but I liked the gymini one better."
27920,1,"Loved this seat so much, I am having to buy another for my second child because my older one won't give his up...It doesn't scratch the furnature, stays in place when used but is easy to change from chair to chair when needed. Don't waste your money on any other brand...this is the one to get."
129339,0,"I loved the idea of this product when my daughter was 2 months. I purchased 2 right before x-mas so I could send one as a gift. When I got them I was still in the ""I need to sterilize everything phase"" and that didn't exclude this one. Without any warning in the packaging I placed this product in my microwave bottle sterilizer and it melted! Lesson learned for a first time. The manufacturer never had the courtesy to respond to my email. So I ended up keeping the other one and getting a different present for my cousin because i really thought my daughter would learn from this. Initially she wanted nothing to do with it. Slowly she started to grab it and place it in her mouth. Quickly she lost interest and found fun in other types of toys. I would say this helped in teaching her to grasp things, but it was short lived. Undecided if I would recommend."
43905,1,"I really like this car seat. The head rest especially. It really holds a newborns head in place. It does get in the way a little when you are putting the straps on the baby's arms, but not enough to not love the car seat. I especially love the color for my little girl. All the pink car seats seem to get really dirty quickly. This color hides all the stains. The five point harness is also an easy way to put the baby in and out. It is very easy to get in and out of the base. I really recommend this car seat."
153831,1,"We love these wipes. They are the perfect size, moistness, and are free of harsh chemicals. We used to purchase them at Babies R US but they are more expensive there. Now we only buy them from Amazon."
34938,1,"We purchased the Alpha Omega when my daughter was about 8 months old because she had outgrown her infant carrier. She absolutely loves this seat. She is now nearing 2 1/2 and still loves it! There is a problem with the straps twisting, but truth be told, I have never seen a carseat that didn't have at least a minor problem with this. The carseat is attractive and though it is a little harder to clean (you have to take it apart to get the cover off) it wears well. I am so glad that I chose this seat over the Britax model that we were looking at.We liked this seat so much that we bought a second one for Grandma's car. I love the fact that the seat can last up to 100 pounds! I'm sure there are other carseats out there that can offer much of what the Alpha Omega does, but we sure are glad with our purchase!"
96839,0,"The product is nice as a plush toy, but the music box that's supposed to go into it is quite a waste. The box, for one, is too big. In addition, the sounds themselves are not all soothing, some a little jarring to the ears even - and these certainly dont help my 20 month old sleep at night!"
86756,1,I have two of these on our stroller. One for the left side and one for the right. Great for holding packages when out shopping. Especially when you need the bottom of the stroller for a diaper bag. Great item.
126235,0,This diapers are not soft as Pampers. Did not like it. Get more smelly with less time hence not convinience.
81313,0,"I Thought the contents will be made out of better quality materials, and they're quite cheap...I am disappointed with the thermometer on particular because it only reads on fahrenheit and I live outside US so we use celsius, but it was my mistake not to read it specifications first."
5742,1,"These do the job: they fit securely into outlets, meaning that little fingers won't be able to pull them out."
85111,1,"I ordered this pillow for my wife who is 4 months pregnant and not only did we receive the package immediately (3 days time), but she also loves it. It has helped her sleep and aided in her sleeping on her side without rolling over. It also has decreased her back and hip pains. I can not recommend this seller or product enough!"
93701,1,Works as expected. I use this with my extra bottles for storing pumped breast milk so that it can easily be warmed and served to baby.
27618,0,The mat was thinner than i had anticipated (i have hardwood floors and there really isn't enough padding in the actual mat). I can not figure out how to fill the water up in it :/ however the pillow on it was great. i started using this mat with my son around a month and the pillow game him that lil bit of extra support. Though he could already support himself pretty well my goal was for him to learn how to roll over and the pillow definately helped to accomplish that task. He LOVES the toys that came attached to it. My son loved the mat. Tho i don't think its worth that high of a price for what it is.
5686,1,"These covers are not as thick as some others on the market, but just as functional. Definely worth it to skip the pricier ones."
67864,2,"After seeing this online, I thought it might be good for storage. I went looking for it at Toys R Us to make my decision. It looks tiny. I don't see how it could hold more than three small toys. It looks like a waste of money."
160520,1,"works great to keep the mattress and sheets under dry. It also is good enough to be used without a cover, my daughter doesnt mind it. Its practical and good for the money paid, recommended."
81382,1,"I bought the stroller and car seat together, and I don't regret buying. It's nice and lite. The only problem I have with it is that the front tray hits the ground if your not careful folding the stroller."
110157,0,"OK I guess I should have figured it out but I didn't think too hard about it...I wanted an extra SET of complete shields, the product description mentions keeping an extra SET at work, so my brain assumed this was a SET of shields. Nope, it's ONE SHIELD assembly. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime so I get free shipping; doesn't matter too much to me that I need to order another one, it will get here in 2 days with Prime. But BUYER BEWARE...this is just the listing for ONE SHIELD.Also...I found out when I tried to use them after I ordered a second one...this does not come with the little connecter that attaches the tubes to the shield, so if you need an extra set of everything, this won't help you."
153629,0,"My son is now 9 months and we hate this chair. He is able to pick up the trays and detach them and also for the past two months he does something with his feet and knocks the trays off which is very dangerous and leads to tons of messes. It wasen't that big of a problem which early on but now it flies across my kitchen every night. It is also very hard to work the 5 point harness it takes two hands and the wheels don't work that well on carpeting. It was great when he was 4 months and barely moved his hands and feet and only eat Cereal but now that he is older it's a huge waste of space and money. When I registered for it I liked the colors (it matches my kitchen) and I trusted the Graco name, I sure learned my lesson."
45729,1,We gifted this toy to our niece Nimisha when she was completing 2 months..Initially she spent only few minutes in this gym..But as she grows she seems fascinated about the gym and absolutely loves it. She is now 5 months old and she enjoys pulling and kicking at the toys. We like the aspect that there are additional hooks to hang more toys. Over all it is a good value for the money.
52756,1,"I have registered for this product, based on reviews and comments from parents with infants. For the person that hasn't been able to find it at Toys 'r Us or Babies 'r Us...try Target. We found it at the one in Dallas and College Station."
49847,2,this lasted all of about 2 minutes before my son pulled the fridge and the thing snapped right off. The tape is terrible on it. My husband had pressed for over a minute on each sticky on it in order to be sure it was stuck on there good too. We had even given it overnight before opening the fridge to make sure it was really stuck. It's made it straight to the trash. The crappy little one I got at the dollar store lasted a full week longer then this.
3026,0,"The concept is good but the execution by kiddopotamus is bad. My baby is quite the mover and this blanket does not work for him. First, he manages to get his hands free no matter how snug we make it-it is all downhill from there. Second, if his hands stay in, he becomes soaked in sweat because the knit fabric doesn't breathe. We don't have an extra blanket on him and his room isn't sweltering. Spend a little more and get a different fabric and don't bother with this one."
100323,0,"I figured that these would be good diapers for day and night for our 12mo, but nope. Almost every other day we find her onesie or sleeper with a big pee spot on it. For daytime use, these diapers are great, just don't expect them to work for 12 hours."
95681,2,"This ""animal hammock"" is terrible. I purchased it based on some of the reviews that stated that a lot of animals (sometimes up to 50) would fit in the hammock. That is simply untrue. I put this up in my daughters room and it barely holds 5 animals of decent size. The front is very flimsy and the animals just fall out. We had to purchase a different type of stuffed animal holder because this one is woefully inadequate. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE this hammock."
44984,1,"We have found this car seat to be easy to install and to use--we particularly like the mechanism for tightening the straps. However, it is a very large seat. This seems to make it quite comfortable for our daughter, but it takes up a lot of space in our backseat and can make it a bit tight for fitting somebody in the middle of the back seat."
2879,1,I received the boppy pillow as a shower gift and it is wonderful. It allows me to nurse my newborn comfortably. The support is great. I also use this pillow for tummy time with my newborn.
126616,1,"I like the dryness on my baby's skin and hold a lot of pee and poop.My baby sleeps through the night with this Huggies with no leaks.But compare to Pampers Swaddlers, it is a kind of hard for new born.But overall we love it."
176047,0,The dresser was nice but the assembly instructions were very difficult and pieces were not labeled or coded. The was a scratch on the door and one piece (an internal frame was broken.
51169,1,"Very Helpful in trying to get a good night's rest ! I am now 7 months pregnant, and I just got the body pillow. I just wish that I had got it sooner. The first night I used this pillow, I can tell you was the first night I got a good night sleep since I became pregnant. You know once you are about 3 months its hard to sleep especially for me since I only slept on my stomach. But this pillow should be mentioned by the OB when they tell us that we are pregnant............."
107104,2,"This is the worst diaper pail ever with my daughter we had a genie and I did get annoyed with having to buy refills. So when I saw the champ I thought that is great and the reviews I read were great, however this thing doesn't keep any odor in. I change the bag every other day and use scented trash bags, yet everytime I enter the room I gag. The other day I had company so I change the bag and she said and I quote "" Oh my gosh it stinks in here"", how embarrassing. I was mortified so back to the genie I go. How disappointing"
100726,1,"Like most people we were originally given pampers in the hospital, I never would have bought them otherwise. I've tried all the decently priced small brands & green brands but unfortunately none of them compare to pampers baby dry. They've consistently held up through teething poops & 12hr nights. They're now holding up during crawling, climbing & bouncing."
151022,2,"I received this changing table damaged (gouges in the wood) and also the finish was uneven on many pieces. In addition, the changing table's height is too low for both my husband and I. We are 5'8"" and would have had to really stoop to use this table. Buyer beware!"
82254,1,A bit tough to get used to - but works great at keeping kids out of the cabinet.
97733,2,I was looking forward to these bottles and what a disappointment!!! First of all you can't use them in a bottle warmer so you have to warm up the formula by other means and then put formula back into bottle. Second of all they do leak!!!!!! I have followed instructions to the T- making sure all the parts are dry and making sure vent is in properly and without fail twice a day I am cleaning the top shelf to my fridge from formula running everywhere. Too many parts to worry about. A new mom just has enough to worry about without fighting with these constantly for one reason or another. I am returning two other packages of these I have and going back to the Gerber bottles I had when my daughter was little. The fact that the bottoms come off of these opens up the risk of a host of other problems. I would not recommend these bottles to anyone. I have &quot;worked&quot; with them for two weeks-I'm done!!!!!!!!
29914,1,"By far the best breast pump for the money with customer service that beats every other pump out there!This is my fourth child and I've been through a lot of breast pumps -- Medela Mini Electric (painful!), Whisper Wear (useless), Evenflo (even more useless) but this modest $20 pump out performed all of them. When a part broke after I had owned it for a couple of months, First Years sent an immediate replacement! Because I needed to pump that day, I bought another pump (they were out of First Years pumps and so I had to purchase an Evenflo at $40!) that was totally worthless and all but kissed the postman when he delivered the part I needed from First Years. :)This pump is perfect for occasional use (I use it once, sometimes 2 times a day), does not hurt!, and the handle is truly ergonomic, unlike the Evenflo model which claims to be ergonomic but which cramped my hand almost immediately. I've never had any operating problem with this pump, no parts falling off, no complications in assembly and the handle is a dream to use compared to other manual pumps.Yes, the storage containers don't accept standard sized nipples, but I don't use bottles anyway so it wasn't an issue for me. For whatever reason, my son even at three months old, much preferred a sippy cup to a bottle.All in all, I have to say this is the best $20 I ever spent on any baby item, I've gotten my money's worth and their service is unbelievable. In this day and age you tend to expect the worst and this was just such a pleasant and amazing surprise ... they stand behind their product and make it easy to address any isses. That alone is worth it to me! I don't have time for hassles, products that don't work and lackluster service .. I'd much rather spend time with my kids."
117539,1,"Nice and sturdy. The tray makes it easier for my 5 1/2 month old to keep her balance, and it's great for other toys. She loves it!"
173026,1,This is a GREAT product for anyone with kids still in car seats. Highly recommended!
128061,1,"I received many blankets as gifts for both of my children, but this blanket has stood the test of time. It's size is great for a variety of purposes, and I truly can get a tight swaddle with my son. Smaller blankets do not work as well on my larger-than-average infant. I highly recommend this blanket for swaddling, or many other uses!"
164509,2,"good price, but stupid shippingthey couldn't deliver this item, and the order returned.they refunded only part of money and i paid and i lost all saved money of online order because of this unexpected returnyou should be careful when ordering something online"
10597,1,"These are very handy. These are just the right size. I use them as a general purpose hand towel towel and burp cloth. They initially did feel hard, but after few washes they became soft. I have had them for a year now and they are still going strong."
18465,1,"Our daughter had terrible colic. We had bought Avent bottles prior to her being born, but each time she fed, she dribbled constantly, because she had to keep opening her mouth to break the vacuum seal that had been created through her sucking. This meant she was wetting bibs, clothes, everything. She went through about five outfits each day.Then at three weeks, our paediatrician suggested Dr Brown's bottles, so we bought eight of them straight away, and the difference was amazing. The dribbling completely stopped, because she wasn't having to open her mouth mid-feed, because there was no vacuum created. It also meant she was swallowing less air, which meant less colic.The colic didn't disappear completely until she went on solids at four months, but I think that had more to do with the fact that some babies are just colicky, and of course, she was picking up on our anxiety, which probably didn't help matters.However, our daughter now uses the B Free trainer sippy cups, which are the same as Dr Brown's, and again, have the vent in, so she doesn't have to suck as hard to get the fluid. Wonderful.The downside of these bottles are that they are fiddly to clean, and I can only fit four of them into my Avent steam steriliser, (five is a squeeze), as opposed to six when I was using the Avent ones, however, to our mind, these are very small prices to pay for the positives that these bottles bring. The pro's definitely outweigh the cons."
33144,1,"I bought this yesterday when I knew I was going to a ""tailgate"" party where I would be away from the baby and having a few drinks, and I may have to ""pump and dump"". I was nervous at first, but this thing worked PERFECTLY! It worked just like it was plugged into an electrical outlet. It successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug. I also bought the Medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by. This outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet, clean and safe place to pump your milk. The cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car. I love this thing and wish I bought it sooner!! It will also be great on long trips, too, so you don't get any clogged milk ducts. Highly reccommended!!"
131958,2,"I really really wanted to like this. I loved the idea of using the car seat and having a place to store it and the added features were great. I really expected to love this.The problems were the same listed by others here. The rocker was the perfect speed and height, but had an EXTREMELY loud clicking noise and woke the baby every time I tried to use it. It also looked like it was barely rocking after I put my 1 month old 11lb LO in and it'd stop shortly after my DS gained more weight.The vibration setting was great though it wears the batteries down after only a short amount of time each time I try to use it.Basically, I use this to store the car seat in when I get home and just reach over and hand rock it every now and then when my DS stirs in his sleep."
15055,2,"I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles. After a few weeks, she began crying alot. You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain. She would also pass gas constantly. It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards. I tried switching formulas - didn't work. Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked. The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it. Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.) Instantly we noticed a difference! She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry! She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air! Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air. I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate. With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles. She is a completely different baby now. She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying.So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE. If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately! Don't just assume that colic is ""normal"" or will be ""outgrown."" Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!!"
5517,0,My son LOVES the backyardigans. He loved the cups I didn't The spout was hard to clean. It had a deep yet hard to get to indention were the cup lid meets the sippy part.
81828,2,This pump takes forever express any milk!&#60;br /&#62;I was completely engorged &amp; it still took over 45 min to pump 1 oz.!&#60;br /&#62;Try the Medela Harmony manual pump instead. It works 100 X better than this piece of junk!
122804,1,"I love swaddling my baby since it really helps keep him calm and helps him sleep better. We tried a few different methods of wrapping and a couple different swaddlers, but our little Houdini managed to wiggle his arms out of everything we put him in... until this. The little arm flaps make a huge difference. He can still move his arms around a little, but he can't get them out of the blanket. As a result, he sleeps much more soundly. Even though this is a little more expensive than some of the other options, if you've had problems with your baby wiggling out of other blankets, I'd recommend giving this a try."
34211,1,"I bought this for a big trip in May and it did wonderfully. I checked in my carseat and when we were at our destination, my carseat wasn't damage and the bag held up wonderfully. My husband and Dad wore it like a backpack out to the vehicle and they had no complaints. Overall, happy with my purchase. The fabric is very tough."
68130,1,I bought this as an emergency sheet for when my son had an accident. It fits great and I love the color.
45156,1,"This playmat really entertains our baby while working on her development! Great animal ""friends"" on the arches - our daughter especially likes grabbing the giraffe, or swatting at the crinkly parrot. The baby mirror is also a hit with our 3 month old. She coos whenever she plays on the mat!"
66749,1,"In searching for a jogger, I had limited to 2 choices, the Joovy Zoom 360 and this Schwinn Free Wheeler. Really, I wished for a Bob, but a couple of things ruled this choice out: the price tag and the non-adjustable handlebar. When you're running long distances the height of the handlebar makes a big difference, and in the case of the Bob and Joovy, they both weren't adjustable. The Joovy wasn't completely out of the picture because it the reasonable price tag and the quality.Now on with the Schwinn Free Wheeler. I was hesitant at first from the negative reviews about the wobbling front wheel. Sure enough out of the box and after installing it, the front wheel in swivel mode, was wobbling like crazy; and that was just from walking with it. So, I was very unhappy and right away thought about returning it. Then after thinking about the hassle of returning it, I decided to see what I could do to fix it.The problem was easily fixable. There is a bolt that attaches the front wheel to the stroller. All that was needed was tightening of the bolt until the wheel isn't wiggling back and forth. Once this was done, I fell in love with it. I took my son out for a test drive and he was sleeping after the first mile.I think extra padding will be necessary when he gets taller as there is a metal bar at the top of the headrest. This probably won't be comfortable for anyone when the stroller hits a bump and your head bouncing on it. Also, I agree with other reviews that mentioned the incline could come up higher.That said the stroller glides really smoothly, and I felt that it was effortless to push and navigate during my 5 mile test run with my 6 month old son. For the price and perks, you can't beat this stroller."
79018,2,"I've been more than happy with Dr. Brown's bottles, dishwasher containers, and formula mixing pitchers... but this drying rack is a disappointment. It is sturdy enough to hold the plastic bottles well, but it is nearly impossible to reach items on the bottom rack. It really isn't worth the counter space it consumes. I would recommend buying a single-tiered or rotating rack."
42430,1,My baby lives in the moby. Once you get the wrap down it's perfect. You can make the adjustments to fit you and your baby. It's called my work wrap now since I put the baby in the wrap and get my office work done. Amazing.
159119,1,"I love this seat. It has held up to 2 kids so far and is in great condition for baby 3 coming very soon.The boys have seemed to be very comfortable in it, the toy bar is close enough to reach yet far enough away to 'see' as their eyes are developing. They loved it and so have I!"
170547,1,this is by far the best car seat I've ever owned and this is for my 2nd child. First time around I just wasn't informed well enough to know this was out there. the safety latches are the best thing about the seat. They are easy to install and remove. I would HIGHLY recommend this seat!
67616,1,Kids love the color and the cup holders - two kids/two seats. My husband and I like the fit and the way the cross belt doesn't drive them crazy anymore. We needed one more car seat for our trip home to see parents and then planned on taking it home with us. My Mom liked the car seat so much that she kept it for the cousins and ordered us a new one shipped to our house. Good Booster Seat. Worth the extra cost and the back can come off later.
41989,1,I've had this a while now. I decided to buy it when my son figured out how to pull himself up in his crib and pull everything out of the crib hanging diaper depot. This is worth every penny!
21613,1,"Love it super good stuff for friend my ,her son love it I will give to my son too ,"
51823,0,"The stroller itself is wonderful, it works great. But the parent consol drink holders are not very deep so water bottles fall out constintly. The shipping company used was Fedex and they sucked big time. After calling them many times they finally delivered the stroller 4 days latter than was promissed, and we were denied a refund of any of our shipping fees."
5331,0,"Looked sturdy but we gate checked our Chico Liteway and the bag was ripped when it came off the plane....Very disappointed as it was such a minor flight/check in for the bag to go through with the stroller in, literally we handed it to the attendant and grabbed it as we walked off the plane - the up side was it did protect the stroller but I will need to do some repairs to use it again."
43605,1,It's a great gate. Very easy to install. Looks great. And the beechwood construction is a definite plus.And it's Made in Denmark.
115067,0,I needed a gate that would work for a larger than normal doorway and this is ok but not very sturdy. Would not recommend for a big opening.
53268,1,"I saw this product last year when my daughter was born. Hesitant to purchase due to the price I put it off. Also, because it was new I didn't know if it was a quality product. When my daughter developed severe reflux and was hospitalized I wished there was something that would help her. I kick my self now after reading all the reviews on how beneficial this product was in helping with reflux and with helping the baby sleep. I wish I had gotten it back then!!I just found out that I am pregnant again and I immediately bought this product. Though I haven't used it yet I am very eager to. My daughter is just 11 mos and can still fit in the product. The weight limit is 25 pounds so she still fits. She is very relaxed in the glider and even though she is very active and walking she will take a break in this. So I am confident about the product's ability to LAST. Many products I have only worked for a few weeks and then became boring for my girls. Others they hated to begin with (my first daughter would NOT go in her swing).Though all babies are different I think that this product is somewhat universal. I have heard that it was designed by a team that worked very closely with mothers and created the product based on actual parent opinions. This seems evident. It is very snug and cozy looking. The different speeds are nice and the music is soothing and fun.When I first assembled it the glider seemed a bit cheap. I guess I expected more support through the cloth part where the baby lays. It is just the cloth suspended from the metal support braces. It is VERY STURDY. I just expected it to be more like a gliding bassinette. This is BETTER!! It really snuggles the baby in there and makes them feel cozy. It is somewhat like a mix between a hammock (though much more sturdy) and a bassinette (though not as rigid and hard.) It is the perfect blend of the two making it like a cozy little nest.I love this glider! I would strongly recommend trying it. If you have any issues Fisher Price is very good about taking care of things promptly."
39697,1,A good friend gifted me with a set of Davies Gate Babies Balm and Shower Gel for my son - he's now 8 years old and he always got complimented on his baby smell. I got it for my daughter who is now a toddler and we are often asked what she is using. My son still uses it and so does my older sister:-) Its very light and good to the skin.
115295,1,"These work nicely when you want to gate off between two solid walls. Not so good if you're wanting to press against say a railing. Once in place. This extra tall works just like the shorter rails. It's more natural for taller people like me. The only drawback is that it opens only one direction (as opposed to bi-directional opening on the shorter gates).I've got 4 of them in the house now. The lift and release function works great. It's nice that the gate sort of closes itself to a latched state.Features I'd wish they think about.... My boys (twins) like to stand on the gate. So if it's propped open, there's a lot of leverage applied to the main gate such that it will move in position unless tightly fastened.It's a good product... durable, easy to use. I've used the extensions... they are not as secured as I'd like but it works."
174450,0,"I think my daughter would give it a 4, I give it a 2, so we split the difference! My 6-week-old loves it on the &quot;white noise/waves mode&quot;-she actually smiles and laughs at the simple shapes and it's so fun to watch her track the figures. It holds her interest more than any other toy. Neither of us enjoy the musical settings, which are both obnoxious. If she is fussy, the music really makes her &quot;lose it&quot; at this stage. I think it's ugly, but I've come to accept that a good nursery shouldn't be about mom's taste, but about what works for Baby."
152324,2,bag would be great in a bigger house. it was too big for ours. too expensive for construction and limited colors available and doesn't allow to prop up like a chair. spent $30 to return it and it was not an easy process so this was a total rip off and shipping was ridiculous.
15866,1,This toasty warm car seat liner has been just the ticket for the chilly weather. Easy to install and easy to use.
174360,0,"The clip snaps together and is easy to install, making it possible to adjust the position of the shoulder strap so it does not rub against your neck and crosses your chest more comfortably. On the downside, the tension pulls the lap belt up and presses the hard plastic clip into my tummy. For me it just trades one discomfort for another, so I don't bother with it. For a few bucks, it's worth a try if you are experiencing discomfort from the shoulder strap."
164596,2,"I was really unhappy using these,they leaked badly many times.In the past I have used the Pampers Cruisers and was very happy with them.I now buy Huggies little movers since I feel those are the best diapers around."
172877,1,"I love the spouts because you use them with the Avent bottles you already have. You don't have to invest in new cups, and you save cabinet space because you use the bottles you already own and don't have to store them. I wish I would have know about these spouts earlier. I bought an Avent Magic Cup and realized the spout that fits it also fits the regular bottles. Then, I found that you can buy just the spouts individually and bypass ""magic cups"" and all sippy cups altogether. Great idea!"
35721,1,"Since my daughter was born in December, this has been a great find. It keeps her warm, without having to bring a blanket and worrying about it staying put or dragging on the ground. I've gotten so many compliments on it, too! Everyone comments on how cozy it looks, but most importantly, it keeps my daughter nice and toasty."
166247,0,"I ordered these after my daughter came home from daycare wearing a pampers diaper, and I loved it. Unfortunaltey, this was not the diaper she came home in. These are plastic and are not worth the money. With the exception of the cute prints, they are exactly like luvs, but a lot more expensive. I like LUVS, but thats not what I wanted/paid for. Also, the diaper I loved so much was actually a pampers cruiser. Which I did end up ordering the next time around. they are like swaddlers...soft, more cloth like."
16514,0,"The bottles themselves are greeat,I highly recommend them to any mother nursing because they are BPA FREE.(chemical found in plastic when warmed)but the screw lids STINK!!!! They cracked in half the first week my wife used them.You can find even better replacements at any local Wal-mart ect.,and the nipples tend to leek alot too.Other than that,bottles can't be found anywhere else except Amazon.Worth it.They are VERY tough bottles, hard to break.Vic Herbert"
70573,1,"If your child does not sit well without constant stimulation then this rocker is not for you. With only 3 toys to choose from and ""vibration only motion"" this works for calmer childen. The rocker portion is manual. My son is now almost 5 months and has been using this for almost 2 months. He's a larger baby so the high weight capacity caught my eye. The rocker is useful for a safe place to put him while I wash bottles, fold clothes etc. He isn't into jumping out yet and is content if extra toys are placed within his reach. The kick stand is great too as the extra tilt lets him play with his feet and adds extra stability. We love it so far. Serves the purpose."
151838,1,"I have the Eddie Bauer travel yard and it fits great. Like the other reviews, I think it's best to wash it in cold water and line dry. It is a tight fit, but I think it fits perfect for the Eddie Bauer playard."
120600,1,"They are soft, well constructed perfect for christenings. Best baby blankets I have used for my embroidering. I would buy more."
174037,1,"My wife and I have found that the papasan swing is the only place our daughter will fall asleep. Whenever we need time to ourselves for a little sumptin' sumptin', we plant her in the swing and do our thing."
110573,1,"We've used this everywhere, including on the floor of some pretty gross bathrooms! I love that the wings fold in before it rolls up, keeping the surface baby lays on clean, even if you can't get to cleaning it until you get home!"
86640,1,"I have 2 toddler girls, and this potty topper is a must! Because using the disposable cover that is provided in public restroom is like not using any cover at all, when it's for toddlers! This potty topper is thick enough,waterproof, it covers the whole toilet seat, and it sticks to the seat because of the adhesive sticker in the back of the topper. Only downside is that it is not flushable..but I can always throw it in the little trash bin. I highly recommend it! I have been using this product for 2 years now, and I never leave home without it!"
131940,1,"We used this swing a lot between newborn and around 6 months old, it's great because you can bring the baby in from the car and snap it right in the swing for a nap. The battery life is pretty good and our baby really liked the swing. It had to be on the highest setting as she got bigger and the noise was a little loud, but because it was so rhythmic it didn't bother her or us. A good product overall!"
43801,1,"the best chair I could get.is perfect for a child who wants to leave his child seat and eat with others at the table. is safe and can be carried everywhere. is very resistant and easy to put on any chair, this should be wide base for added child safety."
109730,2,"I was really disappointed when this came in the mail, and am sending it back. The colors are really muted. It looks like red in the picture, but the red is a pink/mauve color. The comforter is extremely thin. The sheets are cute, but I'm just sending it all back."
34207,1,"I purchased two of these car seat travel bags for a recent flight and I couldn't be happier. First, I found these bags just a week before my vacation and was very pleased that they arrived in time for my flight with a few days to spare using standard shipping. Secondly, they fit my Britax Boulevard car seats perfectly. They were very easy to zip into the bags and I was able to pack a few blankets inside as well. I felt confident knowing that my pricy car seats were protected during the flight and it was very easy to identify the bags on the baggage carousel."
118705,1,"I bought this chair for my soon to be 3 year old son who has outgrown his convertible car seat and kept complaining about back pain whenever I would strap him in. I got my 4 year old son a First Years Compass booster seat when he turned 3. He loves it for it's comfort and I love it because it's held up remarkably well after almost two years of every day use. I know the high quality of this brand first hand and that's why I knew I wanted another one for my younger son. Let me say that I was hesitant at first because I wasn't too sure about the colors of this particular model, but the safety, ease of use, and low price factors convinced me to overlook my aesthetic concerns:) However, in person, the green is actually a rich apple color that contrasts nicely with the deep brown and what seems harsh to the eye onscreen is very nice in person. So now I have a comfortable, safe, and easy to use ""big boy"" car seat that both my son and I love and is not hard to look at! I'm really happy I took a chance and definitely recommend it!"
36,0,Ihave a great deal of trouble seprating the top from the bottom. I ordered 2 and one I have never been able to seperate. Thanks
143931,1,"The light switch is oversized (which you can probably tell from the picture) and we were concerned about it fitting, since our light switch in the nursery is very near to the trim.But it fit and it looks great. If I had to say something negative, I would say that the Pooh figure on the light switch being raised sometimes makes it a pain to hit the switch, but it also makes it easy to hit in the dark. Very pleased with this item, it's a nice touch to the nursery."
32591,1,We purchased the Hearth Gate and extension since we have a gas fireplace with a long brick hearth for our grandchild's safety. The Hearth Gate provides protection from the fireplace as well as providing protection from falls against the rough brick hearth. We are very pleased with this product. We returned the extension since the Hearth Gate was long enough to cover our hearth.
15625,1,"This system lasted a long time. Our kids were pretty rough with it and it finally broke down a couple days ago. The kids pushed on the middle area where the gate is and the plastic broke. (but in the fence's defense the kids are over the age of two and very active). Gate still kept functioning, but we took it down anyway. We LOVED this gate system which is what we used to section off half of a bonus room and made it into their playroom. It was a great area that was just theirs. It is tall and the gate is not easy for them to figure out nor did the kids ever climb out of it. It keeps the dogs out of their area as well. I highly recommend it and if I needed it again, I would not hesitate to re-purchase it! ;)"
171536,1,I got this tub as a shower gift and it is by far one of the best gifts that I received. Our baby loves to lay in the hammock part of the tub for her baths (she is only 7 weeks old). She looks very comfortable and doesn't squirm around at all. I have had no problems with it leaking (like other tubs that I have heard about) and it fits great in our double sink (that is probably 30 years old). I definately recommend this tub for anyone with a newborn. I just hope that she still likes it when I don't use the hammock. I'm sure she will thought!
115318,0,"We haven't officially started potty training yet, just slowly introducing it. My son loved the seat... until I put him on it. He walked around the house with it when we first got it, but as soon as I put it on the toilet and tried to sit him down on it, it was over. He hates it now. I have 2 complaints: 1.) I like that the cushion is removable, but it's a little TOO removable- they need to put velcro on the bottom or something (which I plan on doing if my son ever uses it), and 2.) I don't know if all our toilet seats are weird shaped or it's a design flaw, but I think there's way too much movement of the seat when it's on the toilet. Part of the problem with my son may be that he's scared of the potty seat's wiggle when it's on the toilet. Nonetheless, I ended up buying a Fisher Price potty seat that goes on the floor as well."
158724,2,"I loved the fleece version of this and bought the cotton one for summer. Big mistake. Don't waste your money. The cotton is not pre-shrunk, so when you wash it the first time and it shrinks, the zipper ends up being too long, which causes the fabric to gather/bunch up. Very disappointed."
36160,2,"Difficult to put on and get baby in, and I didn't ""trust"" it anyway, so I pretty much was holding the baby while using this thing, which defeats the purpose. IMO, it's junk. Great idea though, if it actually worked. Overpriced piece of fabric is all it is."
38284,1,"We bought this product for the bottom of our staircase, which is 54 inches wide. Not many companies offer wide pressure mounted gates and this one provides quite a bit of flexibility with 3 extensions provided. The product was easy to install - took 15 minutes and works great. Our daughter will be safe and we did not have to drill into our banister at both the bottom and top of our staircase.We would definitely recommend this product."
142770,1,The pink valance matches my daughter's bedding and gives her room a pretty girly look.
52881,0,"We purchased this chair when my baby was 1 1/2 months old. It looked so mushy and comfortable. I also really liked the settings. You can have music or vibrate separately or music and vibrate together. It turns itself off after about 15 minutes. I also really like the music. Unlike other musical baby toys that sound like old record players, the music on this toy is almost digital quality. It's very clear. Last good quality, the batteries seem to last a long time. We use the chair daily and we have never replaced them.Here are the drawbacks. First, that pretty music is incredibly loud and there is no volume adjustment. It's either on or off. Though she does fall asleep in the chair with the music on, sometimes I think she's just passed out from a migrane after having listed to that music for a while. Second, though it looks like a ""bouncy"" seat it does not bounce. In fact if it's not vibrating it doesn't budge. The bouncing feature was something that we sometimes found useful with our previous bouncy seat. As baby grows, they can make the chair bounce by kicking or we could by pushing down on it if we wnated to rock him or something. That is not the case with this seat. Third, that nice looking cushy padding just mushes my baby's head against her chest. Lastly, because of the unadjustable tilt in the chair, where the vibrate feature is on, the seatbelt is absolutely necessary because otherwise she would just vibrate and slide right out of the chair and onto the floor. I routinely have to re-adjust her body by pulling it up again.As a final comment, assembly was not a snap. It came in many pieces. If we still had the box, I don't think we would have kept it. My baby is now 3 months old and about 13 pounds and though we still use it regularly, we won't be able to for much longer. It's not like it's a safety hazzard, however I would look carefully at all the options before making a choice to buy this chair."
160790,1,"This is the BEST crib sheet out there! It can be simply used by itself by just fastening the straps to the sides of the crib or can be used with a more decorative sheet simply placed snugly in place over it.My daughter is now 6 months and has leaked out of her diaper on occassion, the mattress that she sleeps on cost around $120.00, so thanks to this sheet the mattress still looks the same as it did when we brougt it home."
141596,1,"We purchased this ""Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker"" for our 1 year old granddaughter after thoroughly researching several seemingly similar models by different manufacturers. Several features put the V-Tech version well-above the rest: (1) this is wonderfully versitile: it converts from a ""sitting"" toy that also rolls to a ""standing"" walker that also is a fun educational toy; (2) the educational component [front ""box"" with activities] can be completely separated (safely by an adult) from the orange frame for child's use in the car, or anywhere when traveling; (3) the frame and educational component are heavier than several other models, so this ""sit-to-stand"" walker really allows a toddler to walk without the walker tipping over; and (4) the educational component has numerous brightly colored activities that attract and keep a child's interest while developing her/his fine motor skills. Our granddaughter loves her V-Tech ""Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker"" and we highly recommend it!"
94632,2,"The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great. But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas. When they're using the bottle, you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips. Every time my little girl uses them, it seems as though she just can't get comfortable with them. I would recommend Dr.Brown's or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these.Ultimately, the convenience and features aren't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause."
664,1,I love these diapers. I used them in the beginning when they did not have baby flex. They were a bit binding and leaked easily. I then switched to luvs for the price but they did not have stretch tabs either my son was between size 3 and 4 so the extra room would cause leakage. Size 4 in pampers baby dry were just right and the flex tabs are comfortable for crawling and movement. I liked pampers cruisers but they were a little pricey. I love that the regular pampers have stretch for the same price. Now if only Luvs would do the same.
148520,1,"ProsExcellent support of legs, hips, belly, and backWake feeling refreshedPretty essential for sleepConsLarge size- takes up more than half of queen size bedInterferes with cuddletime with hubbyDoes not travel well due to size (it is essential for sleep every night!)"
112765,1,"It's quite smaller than I had imagined, but it is none-the-less adorable and fitting for my son! And I love that it's made of rubber so I don't have to worry about him breaking it! I would definitely purchase this as a gift in the future!"
130455,1,"My son has been using this swing since he was a week old. It does take a lot of space, but it's worth it. It lulls him to sleep when he just won't fall asleep and it's a safe place to keep him while I have a shower or do a few chores and can't hold him. He also loves the fish that rotate. The only drawback is that the music and fish turn off after a few minutes (another reviewer said 7 minutes)."
22747,1,"Good simple play pen. The base is a bit weak, so when baby is standing up, the base crumples a bit through the bars that hold it open, but it works well enough. I would have been upset if I'd spent more than $60 on it though."
32545,1,"Our family purchased a hearth gate even though we thought it is a little too much money and would have rather gotten a cheaper product but now that we have this one, I see why it is a little bit more money because it is a great product. Strong and durable even for the adventageous child who likes to climb. When UPS didn't deliver when they said they had already done so, I called customer support and they had a new gate sent out immediately with no hassles."
113758,1,"We bought this booster seat for our baby when he was about 10 months old. (Now he's 17 months). We have a full sized high chair which we keep in the kitchen, but it was becoming a major shlep to move it to the dining room each time we ate there. So we bought this product. My baby loves sitting in it, and it doesn't take up any space. He loves to eat at the table with the rest of us. If you don't have any high chair yet, I recommend you only buy this. A full sized one is unnecessary, just take up a lot of room. The extra tray insert is also a great feature. We also take this with us whenever we go to eat by relatives so we don't have to worry about them having a high chair. It is easy to transport."
123887,0,"We bought this seat for our son's grandparents, so that we no longer have to carry a car seat on the airplane when we visit them. Its a perfectly serviceable seat, but doesn't seem quite as secure or comfortable as our Britax. I think its a good back-up or occasional seat, but wouldn't want to use it every day."
108680,1,Great for a nursery.This nursery set is even cuter when you receive it than how it looks online.Quality merchandise at a wonderful price.
6746,0,"I love the Pampers diapers and had been buying them from another site diapers dot com, until I saw that Baby Age had them for a lot less here on Amazon. Being a mom of 10 month old twins, and someone who buys no less than three large boxes every month, I was very excited. Until I used the 'one click' buying and got hit with Baby Age's $10 per item shipping fee. An extra $30 just to have diapers shipped when on the other site I get the same thing for free? No thanks. I won't be buying from Baby Age again.So, the are great diapers and I haven't had a single leak, but I won't buy from Baby Age again. I'll be heading back to diapers dot com."
126937,1,You can get these diapers cheaper at Costco. Even with the free shipping.
69497,1,"I have a Fleurville diaper bag in blue and brown, and even though it's not our daily bag, I do travel a little on the heavier side. These travel pods are such a great thing to attach to the outside of the diaper bag when it's stuffed with other things such as multiple changes of clothes and ten other diapers! Even if you nurse and your child doesn't take a pacifier, I'd still buy this! You can carry a water bottle and personal items instead...better than trying to find them at the bottom of the diaper bag when you need them now!! This was an affordable and ""Can't-live-without"" item for me."
109348,0,my son suffer from excema and i noticed everytime i use it my son had a flare-up. Not sure if its from the material its made out of.
133639,1,"This product is great! my daughter (29 months) loved it at first glance. The duckies are cute and the size is perfect. It is a cushie seat that is secure and comfortable. She won't use any other toilet. I also have the first years' seat with the handles on the sides, but this one is far superior. The First Years one was about the same price, but the foam part is flimsy and separates easily from the base, and it does not stay put- once my daughter even fell in to the toilet water from shifting her weight around on it! This seat is a great value, and it also has a nice hook that you can put on the wall for quick switches from potty to adult toilet."
50349,0,"If you are NOT a side sleeper already, this pillow will probably be great for pregnancy. When you sleep on your side, your hips and shoulders are not evenly aligned, which can be uncomfortable plus one shoulder is always uner you and can fall asleep - not to mention the belly that hangs out as you become more an more pregnant.If you already are a side sleeper, you probably have solved these problems. I sleep on a Temperpedic-type pillow for my neck/bottom shoulder plus use a king sized pillow paralell to my body to align hips and top shoulder. This is basically what this and other body pillows do for you.The problem I found is with this ""C"" shaped design, you are forced to use the Snoogle as the pillow under your head. It is like using a brand new cotton filled pillow -my head was propped up high, causing a neck ache. I only want to sleep with my existing pillow. Also the material was hot. Every night I tried it I threw it out of bed within an hour or so.My solution was to instead buy a ""cuddle U"" pillow which is shaped like a ""U"". I put the curved part of the U at my feet and can use my existing pillow for my head. I tuck the covers around the entire pillow and still get the body support I am looking for. I am a tall person (5'10"") and the curve being at/near my feet is not a problem."
1432,1,It is big enough for my 31-month-old baby. No leaking. Easy to change when you are outside. Soft for your baby.
17370,0,boy 25+ cents for each small packet that contains ONE sheet. it is expensive toilet paper. i thought there will be more than one sheet in each packet. the packet is the size of individual wipe that you see in the BBQ joints. i don't know how it'd be enough to wipe the arce clean after number 2 in the woods (I bought it for backpacking and hiking purpose).
138599,1,"This lights up most of the walls and ceilings with stars and my 2 and 3 year old love it. It is not to bright, but it casts enough light to keep them from getting scared. The great thing is that it will stay on for 45 minutes which is plenty of time(usually) for them to fall asleep."
88287,1,Very durable and sporty looking. Looking forward to using this when our little one comes!
163844,1,We have twins so we have two of these and they are great. We don't have a whole lot of space so these are so much better than stand alone high chairs. Wish I would have had them when our girls were born because they tilt back and therefore you can pretty much put a newborn in one.
73450,1,"I wasn't sure if I would need this when I was pregnant but as soon as the baby came I couldn't live without it! This little item has been the most useful baby item I got for my new son (excluding diapers LOL). After countless sleepless nights you have no idea what is going on and this is a lifesaver. Not only will it tell you how long since your last feed or diaper change but will alarm when your baby is due for a feed (lifesaver for the moments you didn't even intend to fall asleep but did). My son also had to take medication for a couple of month after birth and I used the extra alarm button to stay on track with his med schedule. I have used and abused this timer for 9 months now and will buy another for baby number two. This is a def. must have for anyone who will be taking care of baby with Dad, Grandparents, etc. I only wish I had packed this for the hospital (nurses are bad at communicating when they fed/changed your little one). I would give this item more stars if I could!!!!!"
110107,1,"This has been a nice bed for our first grandchild. At the price paid it is a very good value. The only reason that this does not get five stars is due to construction quality. While it is not poorly constructed, I would not say that it is built to last for years - it will never be handed down to another generation. Overall, though, we have been very satisfied with it."
19179,0,"At 2.5 inches outer diameter these rings are smallish, creating too much friction to make it versatile enough to use with ease. The thickness of the fabric is like a sheets from bedding, but enough stitching makes up for that structurally.Don't know if this is true of all slings, but puts much pressure on one shoulder that transfers to the back, causing pain on both parts."
88331,1,"This bag does not look like a diaper bag so I will be able to use it long after the baby gets bigger. It is not huge (which I like) and holds enough items for a day trip. It has a side pocket for a bottle and the other pocket I use for pacifiers. The two zipped pockets on each top side are great for keys, cellphone, wallet, etc because they are not very deep so you are not searching for your items at the bottom of the bag.The outer two pockets are great for toys or bibs. The inside has some pockets that I use for diapers. It is large enough to hold a blankie, change of clothes, wipes, diapers & 2-3 bottles. The strap is adjustable in length and it converts so you can hang it on the stroller handle(s). It comes with a changing pad.I love the cord material and the color is also my favorite. If you don't care for the cord material, you can get one made from canvas at Target for $30 in either black, red or camo. I have the black one and love it as well. It is called Spark instead of Skip Hop but is made by the same company and both look very similar."
111482,0,The service was great; fast and problem free. The doggy diapers were unfortunately kind of poor quality The tape closures fell off way to easily.
139428,1,HONESTLY THE ONLY LIGHTS THAT CAN BE SEEN ARE THE BLUE AND GREEN! THE OTHER LIGHTS ARE THERE OR MADE FOR NO REASON!IVE HAD THIS PRODUCT FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS NOW AND WE LOVE IT.....I'M THINKING OF BUYING ONE JUST FOR ME TO HELP ME SLEEP! :)
48569,1,"For me, the ultimate seal of approval is that my wife decided it was better than the one she got for herself, and swiped it from me!Unpacked, this bag is nice and light, and the fabric gives in all the right ways without compromising the bag's structure. There's room for a ton of supplies (which is great for me, as a father of twins). There's easy access to everything you need, and a place for everything inside the bag. We've been using it daily for three months and it's shown no signs of wear or weakness. I have yet to find a negative about this bag."
123401,1,"Do not hesitate to buy this playard!!! It is so great!!! Colorful, not boring at all!!! My baby-son is easily entertaining himself. Just do not put a lot of toys in there. Let your baby have fun in this big space: rolling, crawling, sitting and standing up!"
167099,0,"We owned a GRACO carseat in 2000 but replaced it when our dtr. was born in Oct 2006 with this GRACO family tree carseat. It was slightly cheaper than other graco carseats, but I was so impressed with our first one that I figured it would be worthwhile to get the same brand, and since this is our last (of 4) child, I didn't want to buy the most expensive one. I was wrong.First of all, the handle isn't as strong as the older graco--it's flimsy and I always feel like it will break on me. Secondly, it isn't comfortable -- there isn't enough padding (the baby sits on the hard plastic with only a thin liner between her and the carseat, and the cradle part of the carseat (where the baby's bottom sits) is just not fitting right with our newborn (it curves in the wrong place). And third, it's very heavy. Everything is awkward about this carseat. I would not buy it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone--I'm tempted to toss it and pay more for a better one.The two nice improvements since our last GRACO carseat are the 5-pt. harness and the 3 levels of adjustment for correct inclination. But you can find that on other GRACO models.If you're looking for a new carseat, splurge the extra $10 and get a nicer GRACO. Especially if you plan on using it for other children--it's worth it."
83762,1,My son would just pull these off the table. I did better with the plastic ones that stick.
49907,1,"For all the people out there who said theres broke, your putting it on wrong, i cant even ripe it off and im pretty muscular. I have the strongest two year old i know and he cant budge it. read the directions and do exactly what it says!!!!"
87270,0,"My baby wouldn't take the Avent bottles that his big brother used, so we tried these. He really likes the nipple. I think all the burping of the bottle is messy, but my real problem is that my 8 month old likes an 7-8 ounce bottle and if you use powdered formula and are on the go, you can't mix it in the bottle, as the liner only hold 8 ounces. So, you have to bring an extra regular bottle to do the mixing in. That is a pain in the behind!"
38718,1,"We purchased this for several reasons. First off, we live in a small apartment and didn't have room for one of the big plastic tubs. Second, we liked the idea that it was soft and would be comfortable for our daughter. Finally, we loved the fact that it is machine washable.Prior to the first use, I read all the instructions, most specifically the part about washing it following use. The instructions say ""To extend the life of your bath item, rinse with clean water after each use and shake excess water from item. Store in a well-ventilated area... If necessary, you may wash your item in a large capacity washer on the DELICATE or HAND WASH (emphasis added) cycle setting"". We decided to follow these instructions for the first use. They seemed to work well. However, we quickly changed our minds after the third bath, when the tub began to smell. We liked it too much to get rid of it, and didn't want to purchase another one for 3 uses. so we created our own instructions that have worked well, and keep the tub from smelling.Following every bath, we rinse the item with cool water. It then goes in the washing machine promptly (within 10 minutes of baby being out of the tub) with the bath towels. I use a tiny bit of detergent and some baking soda. Once the wash cycle is complete, we promptly hang it to dry. I have never thrown it into the dryer, and since starting this process, never had an issue with mildew, which I attribute to the fact that we wash it with baking soda after every use. It has been over 3 months since we switched how we were washing it, and we will continue to use these steps until she outgrows the bather.If you are considering purchasing this item, realize that the mildew is probably only a result of people who aren't taking proper care of the item. It is ok to do things other than what the manufacturer recommends! I would highly recommend this product to any parent."
107952,2,"I have found this pump to be very frustrating. It will loose the suction if you move the least bit and let down, for me, was practically impossible. Stick with the Medela rental or purchase your own!"
40162,1,Pampers are the best brand available! They are the only brand I've found that doesn't leak. I won't us anything else.
28679,0,"I bought this chair since I am pregnant and I was having trouble with my back sitting on the sofa. It is very comfy and helps with the back however the seat cushion is too thin and sitting on it for long times make your bump heart, so you might need extra cushioning.On the positive note It looks good, doesn't need too much space, and it is easy to assemble."
122905,2,"Yes, yes, I read Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block, and yes, I believe that swaddling itself is the miracle-not this blanket. I had a few swaddlers from First YearsThe First Years Easy-Wrap Swaddler - Yellow(much cheaper and worked better), but my son outgrew them. So, I decided to try the Miracle Blanket. I wish I hadn't spent the money. First, the price is very high. Second, it's a long blanket that wraps--there are no closures (velcro, snaps, etc), so he tends to slip down into the blanket, and the arm flaps bunch up in his armpits (uncomfortable). What's worse, the blanket unravels and wraps around his neck. Scary! He gets very hot in this blanket (despite central A/C and ceiling fan--his back and neck are drenched!), and overheating is another risk factor for SIDS. Oh, and forget about ""quick"" middle-of-the-night diaper changes--it's nearly impossible to get his legs out of the bottom pouch, so wrestling him out of the blanket wakes him up. Overall, I would not recommend this blanket."
155270,0,"I love this border and it makes our Zanzibar nursery complete, but it was difficult to hang. No matter how much or how little water we used this ""pre-pasted"" paper didn't want to stick. My mom and I have done a lot of wall papering and the glue on this border stinks (not sticks!)We ended up having to use Elmer's for the curling edges and just really hope that the border stays put now."
91074,1,"The weight is accurate for the snugli. It was a saver for me on outings, simple to use,durable, & easier to use at the mall. Great gift-strongly recommend."
6223,2,This monitor hardly works. We live in a 1700 sq. ft. house and this thing could not transmit the sound of our baby crying on to the screen monitor at night time. He has apnea problems and we need to hear him at all times...for the one week that we have used this thing it alerted us 1 time out of about 10 of his crying just with the sound. If we woke up we could see the red signal at the top lighting up but no sound. Not very good for someone that needs or wants to keep a close eye on their baby.Also the screen does not transmit a clear imagine if you happen to stand up or switch positions when laying in bed. That is also not a good feature. The only positive point is the hand held portable transmitter. That works wonderfully BUT the batteries die after about 15 hours of use. Not very pratical.I would suggest not waisting your money on this product as the efficiency of it is non-existant. I suggest getting a 2.4ghz one for better reception and notification.
94563,2,"I used these bottles with my second child, and they leaked everywhere. I read some of the other reviews, and I did read the directions correctly and screw the bottles on right, and they still leaked. They also leaked when my husband did it, and when my sister used them for her baby. I do like the bottles, but I hated the fact that it was hit or miss when it came to leaking. The bottles would leak all over my daughter, and she would get extremely upset, and I would get frustrated. I even contacted Avent, and they weren't helpful at all. I would recommend trying another kind if possible."
128437,1,"I bought these bottles because, like many moms now, I'm all paranoid about the chemicals in plastic bottles. I'm so happy I switched to glass! Now I can stick them in the dishwasher and not worry about anything. I do wash the nipples by hand still, but that just takes a second. I was worried before about the thickness of the glass, but they're perfect. They're thick enough to not have to worry about them breaking, but not too heavy for my little one to hold. I definitely recommend these!"
21605,0,"My baby does not like this bouncer. I was so disapointed after all the great reviews. We also own the ocean wonders bouncer, but the bubbles are broken on that bouncer, and I didn't think it was very interesting so I bought the sensory selections. My baby much prefers the ocean wonders bouncer--even without the bubbles!!I have tried the sensory selections bouncer over and over from 2 to 4 months with no success--she just doesn't like it! She doesn't even like to sit in it with the vibrations on--she cries whenever I put her in it. (She does not cry in the ocean wonders and will sit there for a good while.)Also, she is not a large baby, but the sides seem to skwish her.I will say, she does love the bee rattle that comes with the bouncer--but that turned out to be one expensive rattle!UPDATE--at just over 4 months, my baby started to like this bouncer. She will now sit in it and play with the toys on the sides and look up at the mirror. She won't stay in it more than 15 minutes or so, but its enough time for me to eat my own breakfast. But as already said, as a young baby she did not like it at all--much prefered our other bouncer."
84125,2,"This pacifier chain is great-looking, but it does not hold up to lots of chewing/sucking. My son is 4 1/2 months old and puts everything in his mouth. I checked on the chain after he chewed on it for a while and noticed that 2 beads were cracked! I ended up having to throw it out since I was afraid the beads would break and become a choking hazard."
20195,0,"I could not see the actual bottles in the photos, so I did not know that the bottles had special features at the bottom. I may have bought another product instead if I had known."
134030,1,This wipes warmer is great! I throw in a package of 80 count wipes and they never are brown and dryed out. You have to keep the ever fresh pad in the bottom wet in order for your wipes to stay wet and not turn brown.
48891,1,"Very safe gate for crawling babies on the go! We use it outside as well for our toddler, and it works great. Portable..easy to set up..love it!"
172633,0,"I was looking forward to using this product because of the shower attachment. But it doesn't work very well. The tube for the shower attachment does not work very well. It is bent (from inside the box), so the water does not spray. It is too much work to straighten it while squeezing button and bathing your baby. In the end I just use the tub like my mother used to do, and my son is fine with that."
39901,1,"I love the on off switch. I had a different one for my babies, and I love the fact that this one stays on all night."
22186,2,"These are the worst possible version of this product available. They tear when you try to open them, they don't stand up properly, the markings are useless for approximating the volume of milk, and trying to pour milk back out of them is more painful than giving birth all over again. Avoid these like the plague!"
46886,2,"We brought home two Calypso Mobiles that looked neat, but made grinding noises and then quit working within 5 minutes of operation. Save yourself time and frustration and choose another mobile."
175409,1,"This playnest is awesome! My 9 month old son plays in this for hours! The only trouble is that he has learned how to dive out of it when he wants to get out! Oh well, that's why we cover the floor with playmats!"
118698,1,"I ordered this car seat at a great price, when I ordered it was only $44.00 now its $79.00, So I am very pleased about that, but when I got the car seat it clearly said in the instructions that the child has to meet all the age, height & weight requirements. My son meets the height & weight requirements but not the age. He is 2 years and 4 months old but he is very tight in his 5 point harness car seat. So I called the first years to find out if he absolutely has to meet all the requirements and they said YES he does. They told me that children under 3 years of age should be in a 5 point harness car seat no matter what because their organs are still not fully developed & in a car accident they would have a higher fatality rate in a regular car seat than they would in a 5 point harness car seat.I am not going to return the car seat though because I got it at such a great price & it is such a great car seat, I am just going to wait until he is 3 years old to use it. For right now he will just have to deal with the smaller 5 point harness car seat.This car seat is great though, it folds up for easy storage, its got great padding, 2 cup holders & its 5 star rated so you cant beat that!!!!I just wish I would have known he couldn't use it until he was 3. But I will probably update my review after he is actually able to use it in 8 months.Good luck everyone because finding a good car seat for the safety of your child takes a lot of research."
46962,1,"This nursing cover is wonderful! It has made such a huge difference in my ability to go out and about and not worry about having to go home to nurse her. I used this puppy everywhere-on airplanes, in museums, the park, restaurants, Barnes & Noble-it's cute and gives you complete coverage. The front wire stays propped up so I can watch her as she nurses, and it cleans up nicely in the wash. It's super light weight which is necessary because I live in SC and it gets Hot here. It folds up very small and fits in a little zipper pocket in my diaper bag. The neck strap is adjustable so it'll work for anyone. I almost bought one of the more expensive versions, but the only thing I could think you'd be paying for is foufou material...it's basically an apron with wire at the neck. I recommend this to all nursing moms!"
2131,0,"I ordered these diapers because there were no more Luvs in size 5 available for my subscribe and save. I have usually liked Pampers in the past, but I was not impressed with these. For a size 5 they were considerably smaller than other brands in a size 5. They have not leaked so far, but they are not comfortable for my son at all and for the price, they should be. I am on baby number four and I do know that different diapers work differently for each person/child, but I am not impressed with these."
668,1,"I have three children in diapers. My oldest is 4 years old and is autistic. We have not been able to potty train him yet.We tried several brands only to find out that Pampers Baby Dry was always the one we went back to. No question! No leaks! But the cost of our diapers just adds up. Amazon has the absolute cheapest price I have found - in stores or on-line. And free shipping, and I got (...) off with a promotion for baby items over (...) prurchased. I made out! And never had to leave my door! Thanks Amazon! Really!"
114506,1,"As grandparents, we bought this for use at our home for our 12 month old grandson who we see almost daily. It is very simple to put together and is very secure. It seats him at just the right height and the adjustments avaIlable will enable use for well into the future. We strap it to a chair which is dedicated for his use and can even use it to seat him at the piano to tinkle the keys as well as to cut his hair. Well made, portable and excellent value for money."
172168,1,This is a great tub. My 3 month son loves it. It's very comfortable and easy to use. Highly recommended!
80543,1,It works. No more cuts on my son back from standing up. The Bubble bath dispenser works. The only down fall is you have to take it off to use the shower.
129036,1,"My daughter started out in cloth diapers, but due to multiple illnesses resulting in diaper rashes, we ended up switching to these disposable diapers. Her skin has been much better and I feel much better about using them on her skin. The benefit for the environment makes me feel better too. I hope you give these a try despite their unconventional look."
118092,1,Based on many great reviews here I ordered this car bed for my son as Christmas gift. I am so glad I did it. The assembly for the bed is very easy. I put it together on my own without my husband's help. The bed is durable and it is a race car toy too. My son loves loves to sleep on this car bed !!!
38110,0,"When I first bought this stroller, it was much better. Slowly it became much harder to maneuver. The folding mechanism broke and one of the bars on the bottom broke - they were not mishandled! It is also hard to get stuff into the basket, plus the canopies are very flimsy."
42585,2,I got this as a shower gift and I have never used it. I wish I had gotten one that wasn't so complicated to use.
184309,1,"I really liked this product - allowed me to be close to my baby boy and keep him within arms' reach during his first few months. Unfortunately, it is a little too short in length...my baby barely fits now, and he is only 3 months old (and only average in length). Time to transition to the crib...but I enjoyed having him close while it lasted. Also, although we only have a queen-sized bed, it was a perfect fit for baby and me because my husband has been working abroad...but while he was home, the three of us did NOT fit in the bed using the sleeper."
51941,1,"Living in a desert area I'm glad we purchased the air carrier. Our daughter has grown accustomed to it in small stages, and now doesn't mind being in it for a while. Allows hands free, and enjoyable walks."
10015,1,"This product is so great! My daughter is 23 months and we have started the potty training process.The seat is so comfortable and fun for her, she asks to go just to sit on it.The ergonomic design is ideal for their little bums and the way it sits on any of our three toilets (all differnt sizes and shapes) is genius!I can't recommend this product enough!"
110695,1,We bought this bed for use on our beach trip. Our son is 21 months old and average size. We used it as a cosleeper like our stokke crib is used at home and he was very happy in it. We put a eddie bauer quilted sheet on the bed and it was softer.
166820,1,These stickers are great. They are so easy to use and are so cute up. It really makes my room look like an under the sea adventure.
133933,0,"This item is okay, but is it very big and won't fit properly onto the Prince Lion Heart diaper caddy that I also bought. Also, the pads that are to be placed on the bottom do not stop the wipes from browning or dehaydrating, particularly in the winter. My suggestions, put a few wipes in the container so they won't brown so quickly or dehydrate. Too bad they don't have an adjustable temperature guage, or at least a water reservior."
176412,1,"This pump was just right for me. I am a stay at home mom who is still nursing my 10 month old son. Since he was about 6 weeks old, I would pump occasionally so that he could have a bottle. I didn't need the expensive double pump with all of the accessories. I use this a few times a week and find it quick and easy to use."
128153,0,"My oldest son is 3 1/2 and no longer wants to sit in a stroller. He loves the option to sit or stand up. It works well with an infant seat. The cup holder is a nice plus. It is hard to manuver and while the storage basket is large, the opening is small (between the bench and front seat) and inconvenient. Overall, it's a good beginning stroller, but I'm already looking for something else for when my baby can sit up."
184432,1,"like many new parents, I had lots of plans including my newborn sleeping by himself in a charming bassinet and later a crib... WELL... upon his arrival, my son showed us that he slept better between my husband and I for the first 6 weeks, plus he helped my husband and I sleep better not having to get up at every new and strange sound he made (for a new parent all the sounds are scary). we just lifted our heads and knew he was fine, and went back to sleep. Yes, it was a bit tight in a queen size bed, but most importantly, he was safe and we did not have to get up. We used in bed until 6 weeks old, and then used it to transition him to his crib for the next 2 weeks. overall, well worth it, plus easy to transport if need to spend the night at someone elses house during the first 2-3 months."
28957,1,This slider is just perfect! We love it for our new daughters room... We wanted a nuetral color and this one works great! All her furniture is white and it fits right in! and the price is the best part. Pretty easy to assemble as well. 5 stars!
39171,1,This bedding is gorgeous! It has the right blend of soft colors that make my daughters room the ultimate baby girl room! The best part about it is that it's a classic look that you won't get tired of. I love being in her room because it is so calming and beautiful.I was a little hesitant about buying it because it is a bit more pricy than some of the other bedding sets but nothing else even came close to it and the quality is excellent. It is simply breathtaking and well worth the extra money! I am so pleased with how my daughters room has come together because of this bedding along with the other Wendy Bellissimo items that are in the Vintage Teaberry Collection. I highly recommend this bedding!!!!
105708,1,"I was a diaper genie user until my son was about 1 month old. I thought that it was hard to use. We had a friend tell us about the Diaper CHAMP and told us to try it out. The name say's it all. Our son is now almost 2 years old. We just quit using the diaper champ about 3 months ago just because it was just as easy to carry them out to the trash. We have had no problems at with the diaper champ at all. It does a great job on keeping the odor in the pail. Sure, it smells when you change the bag, but you just seal off the bag, and smell is gone. NO refills to buy or anything. ITs great. ITs a breeze to clean and empty the bag. This is way better than the diaper genie!!"
53103,0,the shipping cost as much as the blanket so that is the first downfall. it dosen't cost that much to send to canada but shipping is always so outrageous. i have a store and currently ship alot to the states and it doesn't cost as much as canadians are always charged. second the blanket is scratchy so i ended up buying $25 a meter(yard) to line it with. the blanket ended up costing $70 when it was all said and done. it is gorgeous now though.
29726,1,"This bag is really great for twins, etc. We have tried several other bags, and they were all too small to carry enough stuff for our twins."
132982,2,"I would give this product negative stars if I could. This was expensive and not worth it. It was very smelly. It is easy to use but that is a negative. My two boys find it very easy to get into. I now use it as an overpriced guest bathroom trash can. I have to be careful and make sure the door is closed to that room or the contents will be emptied by my boys. I have the Neat diaper disposal sysem now and I love it. You have to learn how to properly use it, but once you do, it is easy. My boys can not retrieve anything from it. Anyone who says the Dekor is great must have a new born or not use it fom BM diapers."
2063,2,"I thought these would be great for my wee one, I have been using swaddlers and loved them. After just a short time everything was wet and damp eww gross gross gross gross. So I will use what I have left and move on to another style and if they don't work too well i will move on to another brand."
39196,1,"Just bought this for our little girl, Bella. I was very pleased by how well it is made and how serene it made her room, without over powering it. Love the idea that it is all machine washable. It is a great addition to her room. Very girly without being babyish. I disagree with the other negative reviews about the colors & the feel of the fabric. It is considered a vintage ""shabby chic"" style. Giving your little girl a more non-babyish feel that can grow with her. I absolutely love this collection and the colors. They are not fru-fru, but stylish."
72627,0,love the bottle the spout is not as soft as a nuk trainer cup. this born free spout is a little hard but soft. would not recommend for babies with sensitive gums. overall good product.
40998,2,"I love pampers cruisers and swaddlers. Cloth like, very little leakage, no leaking blue gels, and no stuck together gatherings. Unfortunately, I found out that my second child all the sudden became allergic to Pampers; I think it's the new ones with dry weave liners. He started to have red bumps on his bottom everywhere not characteristic of diaper rash (back, crotch, scrotum) and will not go away with diaper rash cream, topical antibiotics nor antifungals. I'm a pediatrician so I was really puzzled. I finally switched him to Huggies and used steroid cream and they went away. I even called Pampers and they told me that the diapers are still the same. ?@$#$ I found out that this is not uncommon with Pampers. So moms beware. If your baby comes down with just red bumps everywhere and will not get better with diaper rash crea or antifungals (nystatin, clotrimazole), it might be an allergic reaction."
2021,2,"I won't use these again! They kept falling apart and the gel crystals went everywhere! They got all over my toddlers bed!!! I change his diaper every couple of hours, there is no way these could be used for 12 hours to keep your baby dry. I'm never buying pampers again, horrible experience with these."
41692,2,"Our first Safety 1st monitor failed in a matter of days. We called the company, and they thought right away that it was a problem with the adapter cord (read: a known problem). We decided to return it to the store and get another one that wasn't faulty. It worked great--for about two months. The connection is loose, the unit does not charge properly, and the company knows all about it. Don't take the brand name literally, people, because you can't hear your baby crying. This product needs to be recalled."
28643,1,"After comparison shopping I found this item to be a match for my budget, style, comfort, rocking a new baby to sleep!"
43158,1,"I think this is the best baby product we own! It does what it's suppose to and what we like most about it? Maneuverability! Amazing! You can turn through narrow aisles and in elevators with one hand! Snapping the car seat in is so easy, too! Perfect for parents who live in the cities too. Great value, plus, it's so good...when you're done, sell it on Craigslist!"
153887,1,I was looking for an alternative to Pampers wipes and I found Seventh Generation. I love them. The wipes are great. Recommend them to everyone.
104062,1,I recieved the Hello Kitty bedding just few hours ago . It is so soft and good quality . The colors are so pretty and the fabric is so soft . I got the set as a gift for my sister in law as a gift ( though she won't tell us the gender of the baby )She is a BIG hello kitty fan . I think she will use the set for herself before the baby is born hehehe . Good thing i got one before they are outta stock .
100715,2,"I have solely been a pampers mom but after buying these I'm thinking of trying something new.The diapers reeked of chemicals, very unhappy and very upset that I had 246 to go through. I will not buy diapers online again, at least not these."
58670,1,In 4 minutes I can sterilize 4 9-ounce Avent bottles (plus caps). I can fit 6 4-ounce bottles in it. I have also sterilized Medela pump parts. Really does a good job!
179806,1,"We LOVE this item. I saw someone with this in an airport while I was pregnant, so when it came time to book our first trip on an airplane with my son I started doing Google searches for ""car seat wheels"" and finally found the gogo babyz travelmate. We have not gotten to use it in the airport yet, but we have wheeled my son around our house in his carseat with it. It was SUPER easy to put together and attach to the car seat (we have a safety first). The ride was really smooth and stable for our son. I think it is going to be great for our first trip!"
37482,1,"Like all of us, I am very short on time, but am determined to write a review on this product! Previously used a Dr. Brown's bag and encountered the same problems as others (poor quality fabric, ripping, etc).I typically pack my son's food in 4 ounce jelly jars (they're glass and I prefer that to plastic), which are pretty wide. Three of these fit nicely in the top part. In the bottom, I usually have four Dr. Brown's bottles (8 ounces), a YoBaby, and two store-bought baby food pouches. This bag fits it all perfectly. The quality of the fabric is awesome, zippers are pretty good, the handle isn't too long (so it doesn't tangle up), and it's easy to wipe down on the inside.Shortly after buying this bag, the daycare workers commented on how much THEY liked it, as well. We use this bag daily and have experienced fewer spills, easier clean-up and no odor (very much unlike the Dr. Brown's bag). Plain design allows other family members to utilize this bag as well.A MUST HAVE!"
112188,1,"The Cruisers are a step ahead of other products. It's more confortable, and doesn't cause diaper rash even after long hours. This is definitely better than Huggies Supreme."
177137,1,I got this gate 5 years ago to block our entertainment system from an over zealous toddler - fascinated with the power buttons on the equipment. I've used it for a multitude of purposes since then - from the entertainment system to christmas trees to pet containment. My original set and the extenstions I've purchased are still in top notch shape after being reconfigured MANY times throughout the years.
1077,0,"The Pamper's Baby Dry diapers are much better than Luvs. The Luvs Diapers leak a lot and does not have very good absorbing power.However, regarding the Amazon packaging, I was not happy. There was no separate packaging from amazon. The diapers came in Manufacturer's original box. Even the manufacturer's box was wide open when it came through UPS exposing the diapers inside. This is really not expected from amazon."
45699,0,This gym is wonderful in every way except for the music. The touch sensitive pad is unpredictable and the music is out of tune just enough to make anyone with the slightest musical background cringe and want to run away. My husband and I can't really figure out why the music is that way. We tried changing the batteries right away and it made no difference. I'm going to try to call the company and maybe they'll send me a new one and it will sound good? I just don't know.The toys are GREAT. My daughter LOVES the mirror which is the best item I think. She also loves the crinkly elephant ear and the long legs of the giraffe.--update: The company sent us a new musical insert for the gym and the music was in a different pitch but STILL out of tune! I mean REALLY out of tune. This is not a petty complaint. Please look at the other play gyms out there.
168610,1,These are the only infant diapers I ever get. But the size may not always be accurate for your baby so get a small package to try before buying the bulk sizes from amazon.com
158437,1,"I bought these originally for my daughter who is now 6 years old. We bought more of them for my son who is now 3 years old. and I just recently bought some more for our daughter who just turned 1. So yes, we love these cups! My wife had bought all manner of different cups for the kids over the years and our cabinets were overflowing with different cups and lids. It was a nightmare trying to find matching sets quickly while a toddler is screaming and pulling at your leg! I begged her to toss everything except these cups, which stack neatly. She met me halfway and tossed about half of the assorted bottles/cups. These cups with the cover work great for our 1 year old. They also still work good without lids for the older kids. Since the cups are cheap and shipping isn't, I recommend buying in groups of at least three, you won't be sorry!"
98520,1,"This is a great product!! I use it all the time for feedings, and for play time with baby. It is definately one of the best baby gifts I received!!"
97274,0,"Great idea in principal, avoiding messy to clean, space eating potty chairs.Plastic material is more lightweight and flexible than I would like and it does not quite fit flush on our Mansfield elongated toilet, causing it to flex and trap small (and big!) fingers when you sit down on it. Also one handed operation is not possible since the two seat layers tend to stick together at the hinge point and lift or drop together like the pages of a cheap book. Difficult for the ""child on the other arm maneuver"" or the easily startled toddler who gets a ""seat in the face"" when lifting the lid.My 20 month olds find the step up a little tall and a little narrow for confident self positioning, and the boy bits bump at the front is too bulky for my little girls to get over comfortably. I think the whole set up will work better for a more in dependant older toilet user who just does not want to fall in to an adult sized toilet."
25651,2,"Everytime my 2 year old falls asleep in his carseat his head tilts to the side in a very uncomfortable looking position. We were looking for some kind of a neck pillow and tried this to keep his head situated up. When attached to the seatbelts, this will keep his from rolling from side to side but his head still slides forward. He ends up with his chin on his chest. I tried to take it off of the belts and place it so it holds his chin up, and it didn't really offer much support for his head. It would probably work great with smaller children though!"
75721,0,"I really liked the look of this dresser for my daughter's new room. The dresser looks pretty good now that it's together but it was difficult to put together. There was also a piece that wasn't painted black because it is on the inside, but you can see the bare wood through the drawer. The drawers aren't as deep as the drawer front and they don't open and close smoothly. All in all I guess you get what you pay for."
113533,1,Its great that it's portable and has 2 adjustable seat straps that can fit any chair! I can pop my son in there and leave the room to do whatever..
69042,1,Even with super saver - comes in 2 days !!!
37900,0,"My son is three and I STILL use these nail clippers. They have always worked well for us. I too use an ear thermometer or a temporal artery thermometer, but I do use the thermometer to test the bath water and it works great for that. I have also used the aspirator and the brush. No, most of the items are not neccissary, but its a nice kit to have. And for the ladies who keep insisting everyone should get everything from the hospital, some of us don't deliver our babies in hospitals. We are not sick and neither are our babies and we don't feel the need to make birth a medical event. I have my babies naturally, at home with midwives and yes, buy my own aspirator and baby brush. I guess I had to sacrifice those ""freebies"""
64414,0,"The only thing this packpack was lacking, for me, was padding. I am a fairly thin person and there just wasn't enough on me and the backpack to prevent some areas of discomfort...mainly my lower back and clavicle. My husband (who has more padding) said it felt fine to him.The construction and durability of the backpack was great and the rain cover is an nice feature. When I put my boy in it, I felt confident that he was safe, secure and comfortable.It is a great backpack for those who have a bit more to love around the middle."
179302,1,These are the best bottles. They beat the avent bottles hands down. I had no problem when introducing my breast fed baby to these bottles when I had to go back to work. There was NO nipple confusion. These are the only bottles we will ever use.
174144,1,"I did a lot of online research before buying this as a gift for my niece and her 1st baby.I knew I'd like an adult size of this myself - so how could a little baby not love it.They have a small house and it conveniently sat against the wall. It could rock in any direction without moving it around and that was very convenient.He's almost 6 months old and still loves this swing.It's his favorite place, and so I looked like a star getting it for her...saved her many sleepless days/nights.It's definitely worth every penny!"
57289,0,This hamper is really big but it is very flexible so it often tips over when my son throws his clothes in it.
88543,2,"I purchased this pampers and I was giving it a try based on the reviews. After using the pampers for 3 weeks, my baby experienced Urinary Tract infection, and I don't know how it happened. I went to my family doctor and the doctor recommended changing the diaper to other brand.I did more research regarding Pampers Baby Dry and there is also lawsuit against pampers.In short, I would NOT use this brand again. It costs me headache and pain for my baby."
105266,1,"After reading reviews of other diaper pails, I switched my registry to the Diaper Champ. I've been using it for my son's diapers for over 2 years now and I still think it's the BEST. Some people complain that it doesn't hold the odors in, but I haven't found that to be the case... and anyhow, it IS a diaper pail! Some antibacterial wipes, a spray of Lysol and a stick-on air freshener is all I need to freshen the inside of the pail every few weeks. (No different from my kitchen trash pail!)I use the tapes on the used diapers to wrap and seal them into nice little packages before you insert them into the unit - it helps the unit keep odors in. This item is well worth the money, easy, easy, easy to clean (and to operate) and I love that I can use any bag as a refill - a REAL money saver. No special inserts or bags to buy just to throw away a used diaper. Which reminds me of another nice feature: Grocery store plastic bags work great... the handles hook onto the inside of the unit and it's easy to remove them, tie them up and toss in your weekly trash. Plus, they are small enough to hold only a few days' worth of diapers - a good reminder to remove all of the germs from your baby's room. Perhaps I'm shocked to read all the reviews of people who'd like for it to hold more diapers and are angry that they have to empty it often. Honestly, people. It's poop. Remove it from your house! A diaper pail is a temporary holding place. How long you want to keep these germy diapers festering in your baby's room anyhow?! (Ask yourself how often you empty the bathroom trash or the kitty's box...)I'm due with our second in December and I've just asked for another one of these pails. They're not too expensive and it works so well I can't even bring myself to try another brand."
40796,1,Pampers are my favorite and I love that Amazon ships them right to my door. The shipping is so fast. It is amazing!
113673,1,"This chair has been great. It took our son a long time to be able to hold his head up, but once that was accomplished and he could sit up comfortably, he absolutely loves this high chair, and so do his parents! It is easy to take with you in the car and to restaurants. Our peanut was in some ways too small for a lot of the high chairs we came across, and this one made it so easy to sit him at the table wherever we were eating. It is really easy set up as well. One strap around the back, and one strap around the bottom and you are all set. It is plastic so it is easy to clean up. The tray is a little difficult to get on and off, but it gets easier with practice and you really don't want it to come off easily since your baby will smack it around. I highly recommend and do not miss not having a high chair at all.One thing to be cautious about is that it is only as sturdy as the chair you put it on. If the base of the chair narrow and the chair is not too heavy, your baby could potentially tip the chair on to which you strap this."
177470,0,"A good pump but I am looking for something that is more efficient. It is quiet and you can control the suction which makes it gentle on your breasts. However it requires some time to express. It takes me 20 mins to express 4 ounces! I suppose I can go faster but then it becomes uncomfortable and leaves my nipples sore. I find I must lean forward for the milk to collect in the container, otherwise it leaks out of the breastshell. Maintaining this forward slightly haunched position hurts my back. Finally it really annoys me that the containers don't attach to the pump well and they become loose, even leaking if you don't constantly tighten them. I guess maybe that's why I can't pump as quickly as most becuase I have to stop so often to make adjustments. Overall not a bad pump but be aware that it is not perfect. I will have to get a more efficient pump for when I go back out to work"
81703,1,"I registered for this product without doing much research. I liked the fact that it had 2 receivers and would run on batteries if we wanted to be outside. After I received the monitor, I read the reviews and considered returning it for one with a better rating. However, I decided we would try it out first. We have had no problems with static and find the monitor works very well. We live in a neighborhood with a lot of construction and have not had any interference. We also have 3 other newborns very close and have not picked up any other monitors. I find it picks up all of my baby's sounds. I usually keep the volume down low because I can hear every peep!I would encourage you to try it if you like this monitor and see if it works for you."
40813,1,Ordered three boxes on a Wednesday and received the whole shipment the following day. That's amazing service and I paid ZERO shipping. That is truly incredible. Thanks Amazon!
149289,1,"i'm a large woman who suffers insomnia. i purchased this product to take the place of my old body pillow. it was a wonderful investment. the contour inside was wonderful. it fell right at the small of my back which is where i wanted the support. i live alone and sleeping wrapped up in this thing was like spooning with someone else.i'm five foot seven and it came down around my knees. they do have pillows that are of a similar shape and significantly longer but they cost significantly more. this pillow is adequate for my needs.my only complaints are that there could be more padding in it, as it does seem to go flat with time and that it be a little bit longer."
22105,2,"I am pumping/ have pumped a lot of milk, and the problem with the Medela bags is manifold. First of all, you can maybe pump 6 oz into the bag MAX. While this might be enough for most people, it often wasn't for me. (Lansinoh and Gerber can hold 10 oz). Secondly, the Medela bags don't freeze flat,which took up a LOT of space in my freezer. (The other two bags can freeze flat, and I just line them up in a shoe box) Medela bags are also very expensive. I don't see the big deal in cleaning a couple of bottles each time I pump. I still have to clean up the shields. Also, it's hard to tell how much milk you have when you pump into a bag. I find it easier and more accurate to pump into a bottle and put EXACTLY what I want into each bag. Finally, I agree with others that this is a pain in the butt to pour. I spilled a lot of milk with Medela bags. Between the Gerber and Lansinoh, the Lansinoh is much stronger."
37896,0,"while this kit has everything the quality of some isn't that great. I like the water temp part works great. But the aspirator was hard to use, we bought another one. Same thing with the medicine dispenser. I like the nail sissors those work well. All in all it is just ok due to the quality."
51494,0,"Bought one to try. Seems to work just fine, but VERY bulky on my trim baby. Will only be using at home! A bit bummed as I really liked the idea of the one size (I had hoped to make these a big part of my stash). Maybe when baby is toward the end of the size range it won't be nearly so bad. Also bought the bumgenius AIO, which obviously fits trimmer (though not by a ton!) ok, though takes forever to dry. My vote: OK, but not fantastic. I don't plan to buy more of either right now, exploring other diapering products currently. Hope this helps."
30329,2,"The rails work great, but they do not come with the rails to hold the mattress up. You need to have the rails to hold the mattress up because this bed does not require of fit a boxspring. My dad had to make these rails to hold the mattress up out of wood. Works great now, but make sure you have these rails handy when converting to the full size bed!"
108212,1,"The reviews on the Isis box say things like -- ""more efficient than my electric pump..."" and ""works better than the two more expensive pumps that I own...""I always scoff at these reviews. But let me just say, in this case they are true. (Not that people probably aren't also scoffing at this review... oh the irony.. but I digress)Bottom line is that this pump does express as much as my electric Medela Pump in Style. Yes, it takes longer as you have to do each breast separatley but it is GENIUS.Incredibly comfortable and totally silent (ok, it squeaks if one of the inside pieces gets loose but then you just pop it back in).I used it ON A PLANE under a shawl and no one was the wiser. I have also used it in the car.Love it."
113625,1,I needed something that was sturdy but not bulky and I believe that this fits into that. it is perfect.
118426,1,"The bath seat works perfectly. We started using it when my daughter was just a few days old. She's now 12 weeks and we still love it.We started out putting it in the kitchen sink but now that she's bigger and needs more room we put it in the tub. She LOVES it. bathing her in the sink without it made her nervous but with this, she splashes and kicks like crazy.I do get nervous that as she gets stronger that she could kick her body up and over the bottom so I watch her like a hawk. I have a bigger baby bath for when she sits but for now this is perfect. and it's so cheap that I got one to keep at grandma's house and one to keep at auntie's as well!"
79255,2,"I love all the other CA baby stuff I have! But my little girl screamed as soon as I put this on! I only got it because our regular diaper cream, Desert Essence Organics, was out of stock. I will be returning it tomorrow. I cloth diaper, and her little bum was just slightly red, I can't imagine if she had a real diaper rash how she would have reacted. Please be careful with your baby bottoms!"
48265,0,"We got this as a gift for our new baby.He's 11 days old today and the video on the monitor has not worked for a few days now.While it worked it was great. The picture was sharp and it worked well throughout the house. Then one day, when the screen timed out it refused to come back on at all. Audio still works, but it's not worth the price without the video function. We tried with it unplugged, plugged in and on different channels, but still nothing. The units were not dropped or abused in any way.When I called to get it replaced, the customer service representative was friendly and polite. They were willing to send me a pre-paid label so that I could return the defective unit and then they would send me back a new unit. That seemed like a good deal to me until I asked about the shipping lengths. They try to send out the new item within 2 days of getting the defective one, but it's shipped UPS ground, so it takes 7-10 days. This means that once the item was delivered to the carrier it would take up to 10 days to reach their service center. Then there could be a day or two turnaround on sending out the replacement, after which there would be another 10 days to wait for the replacement to come. So overall, from phone call to replacement item, it could take up to a month. That's a month without a monitor. Which to me is excessive. When I complained they told me I could give them my credit card information and they'd send me a monitor first and I could return the defective one. So the choices are ultimately to either be prepared to wait for a month for a monitor or to be prepared to pay for a new one. I was clearly not terribly impressed by these options."
102295,1,"I actually bought this book based on all of the negative reviews that it did not have enough ""fill in the blanks."" I wanted a baby book that would give me a topic and let me journal about it without too much prompting. There are a few fill-in pages (see below), but for the most part I can write my feelings and thoughts about my baby in my own words. This seems like a much more personal approach, and one I think my son will appreciate more when he is old enough to read it, than fill in the blank pages.A previous reviewer complained that the pages are thin and newspaper-like. True, they are simple white pages with black titles, but the pages themselves are not at all flimsy--thicker than the average novel page and more like lightweight cardstock. The illustrations are small, simple, and non-intrusive. Black and white line drawings that are more iconic than a cutesy. My only complaint about this baby book is that I would like more topics (birth story, tooth chart, food, favorite expressions, favorite toys/games. . .) However, the pages look like they are about 11"" x 8.5"" and it is bound with ribbon, so I think with a little creativity, cardstock and a hole punch I may be able to add my own pages.The topics that are covered are (with one full page allowed per topic):Baby's Name (fill in the blanks)Family Tree (line illustration & fill in the blanks)All About MomAll About DadExpectationsParties & Showers (2 pages)First ImpressionsBirth CertificateHandprintsFootprintsLock of HairVisitors & GiftsFirst Family PhotoFirsts (fill in the blanks)Baby's Favorite ThingsDoctor VisitsGrowth Chart (fill in the blanks)Medical Records (fill in the blanks)First BirthdaySecond BirthdayThird BirthdayFirst VacationHolidays & CelebrationsLetter From MomLetter From DadKeepsakesReflectionsThere is also a small pouch for baby's first haircut, and pockets in the back to store cards, documents and other loose memorabilia."
171878,1,"Purchased this because a friend had it and because it had received great reviews on Amazon (over the other bathtubs that I was considering). Liked the sling and my baby finally outgrew it this week at 11.5 weeks. So, now she's sitting in the reclined seat... works like a charm as I don't even have to hold her up. The reclined seat worked even better than the sling (as she would usually slowly slide down the sling and I often had to re-adjust her). The drain also drains pretty fast. My husband even drilled a hole into the top of the tub so that we could hang it in our garage to drip dry (and for storage, of course).Works like it should except for one thing. The product description stated that the drain would indicate if the water was too hot for the baby. As stated on Amazon: ""Drain plug alerts parents if water is too hot"".However, no where on the packaging did it state this and the plug does not change color. Being a first time parent... this would have been helpful... but in the end, it doesn't really matter as I discovered my baby prefers the water to be on the hotter side. Strange but true!"
92432,1,"I was a little disappointed to see that it had white tie strings instead of the red, but other than that shipping was pretty good and the price was even better! My husband and I are doing the Atlanta Falcons theme so it's really hard trying to find things for his bedding in Red and Black, and after looking for months I finally came across this! Don't get me wrong the white strings aren't bad and don't look too cheap, but just not what I was expecting. Thank you for helping me finally find what I spent a long time looking for!"
31551,1,We have the prince lionheart rack as well which we love but we have so many bottles that we needed another. I decided on this one. Its great for different reasons. Its great for nipples up top and pump parts and bottles below. Only thing we would change is that it doesn't spin easily. Still worth it.
129911,1,needed an extra base and could not find one at any store or other online site. this one was just like the base that came with my car seat and is adjustable to three settings also. love it!
126840,1,Huggies are better. I have used it for my first one and now I am using it for the second baby. It's great.
159494,1,"This bouncer is thee best! My son doesn't like his swing, but this bouncer keeps him amused. He loves watching the fishes move and the bubbles blow. He kicks and moves his arms like crazy. This is by far his favorite toy."
41303,1,"I can't say enough about these diapers! After trying every brand and cheap brand out there I return to these every time. They might be a little more expensive, but considering it is my kid's butt that is effected it is much worth the price! My kid's (all 3) broke out from other diapers and worse yet I found my son was highly allgrc to huggies causing a near death experience. Not to mention these are the only diapers that I have never had a problem with leaking - even after all night wear. It saves me time and effort in washing sheets, blankets and clothes - that alone is worth the extra money! Plus I have found they tend to block the ""oder"" from urine and such."
9133,2,"Like many new parents, I have faced a lot of gimmicky items in the baby business. This is one of them. But this one costs [price]. I wonder if First Years counts on this item being a baby shower present that will be thrown out instead of returned.The concept is a good one. Since babies like music, place a small, portable CD at cribside. I wanted it to soothe my son while I changed his diapers. Was I mistaken!! The unit skips repeatedly. It drives me to distraction, never mind the affect on a newborn. Furthermore the speaker output is so tinny, Edison's ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" sounds better.Inserting the batteries were a chore as well. I can't report on battery usage since my wife and I do not use the thing any more. Considering that the Discman has been out for a decade, I was very surprised by the Crib CD Player's poor quality.Thank goodness we kept the box."
29580,0,"My daughter loves this mobile. The problem is that as soon as it stops - she cries... and that's every 7 minutes. The music and movement is adorable. However, I should mention that we had to return this mobile once - to get another...the birds didn't work."
105254,1,"We orignially registered for and received the Diaper Genie and had problems with it from the day our son came home from the hospital. When he was three days old my husband took it back to the the store and announced that he was coming home with the Diaper Champ. We LOVE it!!! The fact that it uses regular garbage bags is a huge advantage and we have never had any problems with the smell. . .impressive considering some of the dirty diapers I have seen my son produce. He is now six months old and the Champ works as well as it did when we purchased it. In addition, it's very easy to use. Just flip the handle and the diapers fall through to the bag. Couldn't be simpler. We love this product so much that when I see people at the store looking at the Diaper Genie vs. the Champ I will go up to them and tell them to select the Diaper Champ."

61549,2,"I put this on my registry based on the reviews, and I should have paid more attention to the bad ones. The first few times we used it, it was great. After awhile it got more and more static, and now it's to the point where it has a loud burst of static if someone so much as walks past or bumps it. Forget about putting it near devices with more of an electrical field than a human! It's unbearable unless you hold on to the antenna, and who can sit around doing that?? Time to get one that we can stand being in the same room with. Two stars because it was great while it lasted - a month or so."
177441,1,"I love all of the Avent products! It's the only feeding system I used with my daughter.This is the only pump I ever used and I never felt like I needed a mechanical pump. I could go to the restroom at work and pump in complete silence. It was very fast and effective. You can use any of Avent's bottles with this pump, even the disposable bag bottles. And the carrying case with pump hardly weighs a thing, and nobody will know you're carrying around a pump and milk. The pump is very smooth and won't tire out your hands.I'll definitely use this pump again with my next child."

169828,1,"We purchased the Emily Three Drawer Changer to go with our Emily Crib. We were stuck with oak since, when we purchased our house, the previous owners left us a custom-built beautiful bookcase in what is now the nursery.Having said that, the color turned our beautiful. I've seen other changers and they are very flimsy. Granted, they are cheaper than this one and do not have drawers, but still.Assembling required the help of my pregnant wife, which I wish wouldn't have been necessary. No carrying or lifting, just holding on to parts.I do have to say that one of the side pieces arrived damaged. I called the number on the box (save the box, at least for a little bit) and the company was very responsive. Within a week I received the missing piece, free of charge.By the way, we bought a changing pad. You do not have to do this. It comes with one. It is not thick, by any means, but how long are you going to keep your baby on the changing table, anyway?"
37046,2,"When it was time for our child to graduate to a larger car seat, I researched (for about 3 months) to determine which one would be the safest and easiest to use. My daughter had been in a Britax Roundabout (which we absolutely adored) and wanted to get another car seat from Britax, but at the time the only one that they made that fitted our needs was only available to purchase on-line (it also had a few bad marks for being too big and we were worried that it wouldn't fit in out car). So, after my months of research, I came to the decision that the Cosco Summit was the best pick. It had high ratings from most of the web sites that I had visited and we had gone to the store to test it out. With that, we purchased it, and have regretted it ever since. It was difficult to put in the car, the harnesses for the latch system and strap to tether it to the back of the car are so difficult to tighten that my husband nearly gave up. Neither me nor my husband had any problems moving our Britax from car to car, it was so simple to install. With the Cosco, I CAN'T move it myself. I have to have my husband do it, which is a huge inconvenience! The straps are constantly twisting, which makes it difficult to put a child in the car when you are in a hurry or are standing in the pouring down rain! It is also difficult to tighten the straps once the child is in the seat. Needless to say, we will be purchasing a different car seat and it will be a Britax (they have since come out with a new, less bulky model). From now on, the only car seats that we will buy will be from BRITAX."

Never had leaks with the competitors, but we've had 3 blow-outs in 3 nights with these. I'm ready to try cloth and deal with the laundry. It can't be worse than washing sheets & pj's every single day. I'd rate these zero stars if could."
91175,1,"We bought the Eddie Bauer. Had problems and went back and bought this one. I should have bought this one the first time. We got this over the weekend and so far everytime I have put my 6 mo old in it he has fallen asleep with ""no head falling foward"". He seems very comfy. He isn't quite used to the 5 pt harness yet as his Graco only had 3 but if that is the only complaint then it was well worth the money.In this area I would recommend to spend the extra money and get this. The base is small; it fits perfectly in our VW passat with plenty of room for the middle and other side of the backseat. It reclines the furthest of all for the rear-facing position. It has velcro on the sides to grab the harness and keep it out of the way as you put your baby into and out of the seat. The strap to tighten the harness is much easier to use. Installation for the LATCH took less than 10 minutes. The Eddie Bauer took 45 minutes, had to ensure everything wasn't twisted and the latches for the LATCH were difficult between the seats and the base of the carseat.Difinitely the best buy....."
89897,0,"I bought these diapers because of their low price. They are okay, and comparable to luvs. I was expecting better absorbancy since they are ""Pampers,"" but I didn't get it. If your child is close to going up in size, I'd say order a size up. They fit fine either way, but it gives you more absorbancy to avoid leaks. I'm satisfied becuase of their price, but they aren't my first choice in diapers."

143661,1,"On my first attempt I installed the wall connector upside down. The strap will not hold in this position. However, if I'd paid closer attention I would have noticed that the wording on the connector was upside down. After installing it correctly, the strap held great. The furniture hardly moves away from the wall at all.Be sure to use a stud locator to make certain the wall connectors are secured. You can't just connect these to drywall. Also, you'll have to drill a couple of holes into the back of the furniture. Depending on the type of furniture, it may be difficult to find a large enough piece of solid wood for this purpose."
7461,0,"A friend recently had a baby and got this stroller to use while the baby was still in an infant carrier. I payed attention while pushing it for her on a couple recent outings.She lives in the suburbs and really likes the convenience of being able to pop this baby in and out of her trunk on a moment's notice. They have a MacLaren but for the most part it will stay parked until baby outgrows the infant carrier, and our friends seem perfectly content with that.I was less than enamored, for two reasons:(1) It doesn't seem to be a serious ""strolling"" stroller, for long walks and such. I pushed it on a walk around my friend's neighborhood with the baby, and it didn't seem to take the bumps or the curbs too well. I was really nervous when we came to steep curbs that it would fall over. But, again, I think she uses it mostly to pop in and out of her trunk and take to stores, the mall, friends' homes, etc., and it is perfect for that.(2) It is not durable enough to take the streets of the city. I live downtown in a large city, and when the baby came to visit, I pushed the stroller around. The stroller was NOT good at taking the bumps on the cobblestone streets or the cracks on the sidewalk. I think it was the little plastic wheels.So, I would still recommend it for the right circumstances. Those who live in the suburbs and do a lot of in-car/out-of-car and shopping on smooth surfaces (indoors) should get this! Why anybody gets those god-awful heavy travel systems is beyond me. City dwellers who want the ease of use that comes with something like this should spend a little more and get something that is going to have more shock absorption for all the sidewalks. The Inglesina Zippy, for example, opens *and* closes with *one hand*, takes a car seat, and has a much smoother ride. Great for hitting the city streets, taking the subway, etc.-- very easy to use. I've also heard good things about MacLarens and the new Peg Perego A4, but no firsthand knowledge. Happy strolling!"

55709,2,"I should give this product 3 stars. It is quicker than using boiled water. Also convenient because you do not need to worry about turning off anything. But just as other reviews, the performance is unpredictable. Sometimes it gives too hot sometimes not warm enough. I am using Dr.Brown's narrow bottles. For 3 ounce cold breast milk, water at level 6 (suggested by the manual) only makes it not cold. Anyway, I would say it is really fast.However I would like to give only 2 stars because I received a used one!!!!! It is so dirty on the bottom of the basket!!!!!!! This is really ridiculous for a product sold by Amazon!!!!! But I really need it immediately for I do not want to boil water in the midnight. Also the price at this time is acceptable. Next time I would require a replacement. Just be aware."
137151,0,I am disappointed in this product...The description for it quotes that the wool is an inch deep but mine is not at all and also very thin and sparse - nothing like what I expected for Australian/NZ wool (I should know since I come from Australia) and nothing like the photo - the picture shows a lush sheepskin with the baby's hands disappearing in to the wool...a baby's hand/fingers would not disappear in to the one I received... not the quality which was described nor what I expected after reading the other reviews
89989,1,"I have used these diapers with both of my children. They were the only ones that didn't leak or explode. Plus you get the Gifts to Grow reward points, which are a great bonus!"
65484,1,"Here are the reasons I gave the co-sleeper four stars instead of five. 1. My husband said it was not easy to convert from co-sleeper to bassinet (changing the railing height). 2. I have yet to use it as a true co-sleeper. I have just been pulling the bassinet up next to my bed; it is way less work. 3. I am apprehensive to purchase the leg extenders, which we need to make the co-sleeper work like it is intended to, because another reviewer stated they made the product wobbly. BUT...I love the material the co-sleeper is made off. The product is soft and durable. The fern color is great. The co-sleeper is easy to move. It is a good size. The storage pockets on the side and underneath have proven wonderful."
2761,2,"This pillow was too shallow to hold the baby in the right position for me, and I'm only 5'4"". In fact, having him nurse on this pillow caused him to pull on my nipples, even when he was latched properly, causing me much pain, and cracked and bleeding nipples, until I figured out what was going on.I don't know if you're one of those moms who's got a waist immediately after giving birth, but I wasn't. And, I found that the waist opening was a little too small to accomodate my slowly shrinking baby belly.I wish I had bought a ""Breast Friend"" nursing pillow instead. Its a little bigger and more adjustable."

109791,1,"I put this together myself and found it to be very easy once you get all the poles laid out in front. I did install the middle bar even though my son's mattress was not over 11 inches or whatever it was. So far after 4 days/night, he's not fallen out and seems to be very sturdy.One thing to note - this bedrail has a teather so you can not just simply slide this out like the old time bedrails.Also, it states it is not to be used with a toddler bed."
59879,1,"I have to say that this tub is great. Before this tub, I purchased a few of those smaller infant tubs only to realize that they could not grow with my baby. I love this tub because it is large enough for my 18 month old to splash around and be comfortable, and also because I don't have to bathe her in my big bathtub which has sliding glass doors. It is so roomy that I even put my other daughter, who is 7 months, in the tub and bathe both of them at once. The only drawback is storing the tub, b/c it is large. Definitely worth the price for all the use you will get out of it."
171221,1,"This was the third tub we bought for our little guy and it finally met all of our needs. We originally had a bath sling which was like a seat that you had to place in the regular tub. The downfall is that you had to fill your regular tub with 3-4 inches of water before the water would touch baby's skin. The sling that comes with this tub allows you to only have to fill the baby tub with a few inches of water and waste much less!The foamy green area that the older baby reclines on works great -- grips him so he is less likely to slip, and it is a soft cushioner from the hard plastic. The second tub we bought was an inflatable tub and this was my number one compaint. It was an import from Australia and plenty soft, but baby would continually slip until his head was in the water.Another great plus is that there are notches on the underside of the tub so it can set securley over your kitchen sink. A BIG plus to avoid hurting your back when bending over to wash baby. It's also nice that the drain plug doubles up as a water temperature tester. An easy visual check to make sure water isn't too hot. We love it."

I love baby powder, baby lotion smells to begin with and this is great for layering with those products. For $2-$3 you can not beat this for a great smell. I could buy this by the CASE I love it so much!!!!"

175967,1,"I have a very fussy (gassy) baby that hardly takes naps or sleeps for longer than 2 hours. There are times when he refuses to be put down due to gas. I can't sit or do anything else but stand and rock him sometimes! I spent months deciding on a baby wrap, I actually had the moby wrap on my baby registry but didnt receive it. I was unsure if I wanted to spent $50 on what is essentially a long piece of fabric. I looked at so many other slings and wraps and really was stuck on what to buy! I was thisclose to ordering the moby so many times, then by chance on one of the mommy blogs I follow someone mentioned the K'tan.I instantly liked it better than the moby, bc though it is more money, it is already wrapped for you all you have to do is loop it through your body. I watched a few videos and it seemed easy and fast to put on and off. I ordered XS since I am 5'3 and under 100lbs. It was a tight fit at first, but it definitely stretches out.I can't stand for long periods of time (I had spine surgery) so having a wrap that was comfortable was key. I can def. stand and walk what's good distance for me with my baby in it! It distributed the weight evenly.From the beginning my son loved being in the wrap! I bought it when he was a little too big to be in the special nursing position, but now the hug position works just fine for us to nurse. Compared to walking and rocking him around endlessly, he falls asleep in less than half the time when in the wrap. The best bonus is that since he is gassy, being in the wrap especially helps to put pressure on his tummy to relieve gas.The only negatives I see is that you cant share if you and your hubby are different sizes. My hubby would be a Large so we cant share it which sucks. Next baby I will probably buy him his own! He thinks it looks cool and was jealous I have an easy way of holding and snuggling baby! he is willing to wear it so its def. dad friendly. The other negative is it doesn't fold up nicely to go in the diaper bag; its quite bulky.Another thing is the sash is def. needed, i don't know why they have ""free sash included!"" in advertising when its a necessary item. My son is about 20lbs and still fits very comfortably in it and still loves it, but for long walks around, having a long (lengthwise) sash would be more secure since he is bigger and taller.I'm very happy I found the k'tan, I only wish I had it when he was a newborn, how much easier things would have been! Im thrilled I have it already for another baby though!"
150047,1,"The tray is a nice size for coloring or playing in the car but because it has to be soft for safety reasons it is a little floppy and doesn't really stay flat. It worked nicely for us on a very long (17 hour) road trip with a 2 year old. It has buckles on the sides so you can tighten it once and then just release it to make a pit stop. A cup hole would be nice, but it is good for snacks. The raised edges are great for keeping things from sliding off. I wouldn't use it for short trips in town, but we travel fairly often and this is a nice addition."
25765,0,"The wood on this gate is much thicker than other designs I have seen. This makes it a great option if you're dealing with dogs or toddlers. (We have both). The non-pinch top is good, easy to install unit, works. Height is perfect, width more than adequate, and it's just flexible enough to install in odd places. I recommend it. I doubt however it is something that could withstand more than a couple of years of being beaten by dogs and kids. Packaging was horrible, but item arrived in one piece with all its parts."
28023,1,"I bought this walker for my 9 month old son - after reading it's reviews, i was impressed by all the positive reviews, and more importantly, that it rolled well on carpet and tile..All those reviews were right on! We live in a house, in germany, where everything is tiled - and we have an area rug on the floor of the living room - this walker is awesome on both. My son is a speed demon, and loves to chase the dogs around - they all get their workouts!I can't recomment this walker highly enough - we did super saver, and got free shipping to our APO address (which doesn't work for everything...) and within one week, the walker was here. Putting it together was so easy and while the toys are nothing particularly special, my son still loves playing with them - this holds his attention for about half an hour at a time, which is a MIRACLE, and a gift when i am trying to cook dinner!It might not be the coolest walker out there, but it is awesome in it's own functionality - A+++"
25161,2,"Received this item and it would not fit on our cosleeper. After much searching on the internet I discovered that the design of the legs was changed on the co-sleepers approx. 2 years ago (2003?) and the leg extensions do not work on the older model. With the use of some power tools and duct tape we were able to make them work, but this information should definitely be provided when you read about the item.I'm sure the extensions are fine if you have a newer model cosleeper."
26534,1,"I assembled this product by myself without any major problems.Just so you know the instructions are not that great.The pictures of the nuts and bolts do not look similar towhat you get, so it takes some time to figure that out.Once that was done it went together fairly easy. It seems tobe a hard item to find, but here in Illinois almost all the Babies R Us have them in stock.I was missing some parts and when you call for replacementsthey do not have any in stock.I Called the store and they took parts from another box togive to me. Looking forward to using this very much !!!"
170346,1,"After some research, we decided to buy the Britax Marathon for our daughter. It was a great value for the money in our opinion. It is a very safe seat and easy to install. I was very pleased at the comfort in the seat padding and the fact the seatbelts rarely twist. My daughter is tall so this seat was perfect for her and will fit her until she's 65 lbs. I loved the Ashley Floral pattern...not only cute and girly but practical for the hot summers here in Texas. I highly recommend this seat!"
99082,1,"We switched our 16 month old son from the cruisers to the baby dry a few months ago because we got more for our money. I didn't really like the cruisers because they seemed loose around his legs, and we would occasionally get leaks. The baby dry works great for us, no leaks, and it's nice to get a few more diapers per box."
99137,1,"This dipers are really good.. They are good for the night too, as good as the diapers that are made specialy for the night.."
161915,2,"This tub would be great if it didn't leak all over. I have been trying to use it on the countertop for my 10 week old, and half way through the bath, water is gushing everywhere. It is too difficult to put it in our bath tub while the baby is small, because you [hurt] your back and it is not very safe trying to lift the baby out of the bath."
160627,1,"This sheet is awesome! I love that I can still see my pretty sheet underneath. I love that it snaps on and off. I have washed/dried this sheet many times, and it still looks great. As for comfort, my son sleeps well on it, it feels soft to the touch. I love that I didn't have to buy a mattress pad, waterproof sheet and sheet to protect my mattress. I think it is a great value and makes changing the sheets a breeze. I can get this pad off and on with one hand while holding my son. Definately a great buy!"
157081,0,"The product looks great and is definitely entertaining, however I was strongly cautioned in its use by a leading licensed physical therapist with years of experience. (I can provide her contact info if anyone is interested). Please be aware that babies MUST be able to sit by themselves for some length of time before they use this product, otherwise the spinal column (which is not yet strong enough if the baby is unable to sit alone)will sag and bow while carrying the baby's full weight, causing irreparable damage to back and neck in the long term. Furthermore, until they are able to place their feet FLAT on the ground do not allow them to stabilise themselves or turn the saucer while on tiptoe. (Very bad for their equilibrium and their posture later on). Keep the feet completely above the ground or else lower the saucer so they must place feet flat on ground. (Same goes for walkers. Frightful, dangerous things)."
136973,1,I got these to match a theme for our son's room. The decals went on easy and look good. We have bought similar decals for our daughters room. Initially they were up in her nursery and then we moved her down the hall to her own room and the decals came off and went back up easily.
88330,1,I love this bag--and I don't have a baby! I used it on a trip to Europe (I took out the little baby changing mat). It has a place for everything and was really comfortable to wear.
75419,1,"I've read the other reviews because I came online to find and purchase this for some upcoming baby showers, and since it gets mixed reviews I thought I should write one. We have one that was given to us at our baby shower 3+ years ago and have worn the thing out, so I might buy another for us, too! This is a great price! Over the past 3 years and 2 babies, I've actually owned a few different ones (we got 4 as gifts!) and this is hands-down our favorite. We don't use the included wipes case--we just use that for the diaper bag, and we just put the small travel packs of wipes you can buy that are less than 1/2 inch thick, though we have used thicker half-empty wipes packs, too, and don't find it too bulky with a couple diapers. Definitely not a gigantic diaper bag! This is perfect for traveling--when you're stopping just to run into a gas station for a bathroom/diaper break, or when flying and hanging out in airports. What I like best about THIS particular changing pad is that it's rectangular, and I can unhook the velcro closure, shake it out and lay it on a changing table all one handed while holding the baby in the other arm. I can't do that with other pads that require more complicated folding/closures. Same thing when I'm done--easy to zipper up, fold up and velcro shut all with one hand, which is generally helpful if you're holding a baby. :-) I have had a LOT of other mothers waiting in line or passing by comment on how much easier it looks to use this pad than either what they have or carrying around a whole diaper bag.Yes, you can load it up as much as you want and it will be thick, but like I said--for quick trips in and out of the car or in between flights, it's ideal when you don't need your whole diaper bag. And for the price, why not have one in the car at all times ready to go?"
17274,1,"I dont know how I survived without this monitor with my first child!!! It is so nice to have a constant view of my new baby, rather than just hear her. I had a regular monitor with my first child and it seemed with her every cry i was going to check on her to see what she was doing. With the video monitor I can rest more peacefully knowing i can see her at anytime without having to go into her room. What a reassuring feeling!I recomend this monitor to anyone with a baby or small child. This was my favorite shower gift. I probably wouldnt have bought it myself, because it is a hundred dollars. but I rate it as my most valualble baby product. I just cant say enough!!!"
174356,0,"Here is a clever little device that may have you wondering, ""Now why didn't I think of that?"" Well, with a binder clip you may have already tried something yielding a similar result, but with a little plastic extrusion molding and a lot of marketing, you will find the ""Heininger Automotive 1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster"" in auto parts store grab racks everywhere.,It is the essence of simplicity, a two-piece plastic buckle that snaps over the lap portion of your seat belt. You tuck the shoulder belt into a downward-facing clip and then are able to slide it from side to side to alter where the shoulder belt hits your shoulder. Or neck, or wherever. It does seem like a better alternative than slipping out of the shoulder belt altogether. Not like I'd ever do that, of course. (ahem). But it works well, despite a drawback or two.It's purpose is to relieve the pressure and chafing of a car's shoulder belt, in a vehicle like mine this can be quite irritating; or put the shoulder strap at a more advantageous position for height-challenged individuals. But after once putting my shoulder belt to that severest of tests (it passes) I am leery of anything that compromises the integrity of a factory-designed safety system.However, in it's defense, I would expect upon impact the plastic would pop off as the belt cinched up- assuming yours does that. Older or poorly serviced systems may not function as well. The packaging says it has been ""crash tested"", this is reassuring, although how often and with what type of restraint systems is unclear. (I see from another review that this is exactly how it behaves, quite reassuring.)Apart from that little issue, the device works fine. My only other complaint would be that while it does perform as advertised, it also pulls the lap belt portion up and away from one's hips and over the belly, into the ribcage. This is both uncomfortable and certainly not the way I was taught to wear a belt. I tested it out in cool weather and bulky clothes, I think I will feel more strongly about it- one way or the other- when summer comes.UDATE, July 01,2010: Summer arrived this week bringing a few +100 days with it. I have to report my earlier impressions were correct, without big clothes, the irritation factor of the relocated lap belt is annoying- but as much as the shoulder belt? Probably more."
28370,1,I like this rocker it is comfy and my husband put it together fairly easy it only took him 20 minutes. The ottaman had a small mark on it but I don't need it perfect and it is hardley if at all noticable. that is the onlyt reason it didn't get a 5 star.
105604,0,"Overall i was not impressed. It isnt easy getting the dirty diapers into the pail using the lid. The diapers usually get hung up or caught and it takes several tries to get it to fall down into the pail. No matter how often I emptied it it always smelled. I liked being able to use garbage bags however, it was easy to change out. I ended up not using it and just putting the diapers into the regular garbage."
9972,1,Excellent potty seat. LOVE that it's adjustable and solid. It does not slide around like other seats and is contoured just right for little tushies. I bought 2 other cheaper seats but neither fit our toilet seat very well and were uncomfortable for my son. I wish I would have spent a little more and bought this one first! Highly recommend!
179809,1,"Haven't got to use it yet but it looks like it will work just fine.Sturdy construction, looks easy to use."
129932,1,"I purchased this product for my hubby's vehicle and we LOVE not have to transfer the carseat back and forth all the time. It works great, highly recommended."
65804,0,"This is not really a review of the product itself, but rather a comment on the return policy and our experience. We returned this item well over a month ago (not quite what we wanted) and we are still waiting for our refund. Calls to the number on the invoice go unanswered. Beware if not buying directly from amazon."
93518,1,I thought this would be a great potty for my little boy. It leaks virtually every time he uses it and it has been constant mopping up for me. Do not waste the money!!
110871,1,I give our 10 month old son his baby buddy toothbrush every night during story time and he chews on it happily. It really helps with teething too. Great product.
113362,0,"I purchased this baby monitor about 4 months ago. I love the portability. It's been great. however, considering I only use it about once a week, I am surprised that I am already having problems with it. The rechargable battery has stopped charging all together. I should'nt have to replace this battery already? I barley use the thing. This is a new model, maybe there are still some problems that need to be worked out. anyhow, I will be taking it back."
149174,0,"I thought this would be the perfect pillow even when the pregnancy is over. The size of the pillow upset my husband (we have a King-sized bed). The nights that I slept with this I woke up too hot...so did my husband. If it were longer and not wider it might stand a chance (I am 5'7""). The head section has extremely tight fabric and not enough filling so it is very hard and not ergonomic. I find it comfortable flipped around for reading in bed. I plan to use it for nursing or maybe I can turn it into a toddler chair or something. I plan on purchasing another for sleeping :("
161547,2,"I purchased this tub because I liked the idea of using the same piece of equipment from birth until my son is sitting up well on his own. Buyer beware! I read all the directions, slid the tub open and locked it in place and it still did not hold water. I had to stuff a towel in the crack where the two pieces come together in order to get a few inches of water to stay in the tub. In addition, the fabric on the infant sling has too much &quot;stretch&quot;. When I put the baby on it, the fabric slowly stretched lower and lower. Fortunately, the tub wouldn't hold water or the baby's head would have been under by the time the bath was over. This product should be taken off the market!"
60495,1,"This is the only infant tub that our girl fits comfortably. I gave it 4 stars only because it has a plug on the bottom which does not completely seal. We returned the first tub, and resorted to duct tape on the bottom of the second tub. Even with the issue, I would highly rec this tub!"
102852,2,"Within a month of using this pail, the lid would keep popping open. The reason that I purchased this pail was that I liked the idea of not having to buy refills and could use regular kitchen bags. Now that my son is eating solids the stinch coming from this diaper pail is terrible! I decided yesterday that I was tossing this pail and going with the 'Diaper Genie', which I have heard mixed reviews on but anything beats this pail. I realize that all diaper pails are going to smell a little--look what goes in them! However, this pail should be taken off the market."
100508,0,"I ordered these diapers because there were no more Luvs in size 5 available for my subscribe and save. I have usually liked Pampers in the past, but I was not impressed with these. For a size 5 they were considerably smaller than other brands in a size 5. They have not leaked so far, but they are not comfortable for my son at all and for the price, they should be. I am on baby number four and I do know that different diapers work differently for each person/child, but I am not impressed with these."
83209,2,"This sling was extremely uncomfortable for me...even when my baby was a newborn and only 7 pounds. I am 5'5"" and slender so that may be part of the problem. (As I see that other petite/slender people found this sling problematic.) I had a lot of back and neck pain with this sling. I currently use a Maya Wrap (which is unpadded) which is extremely comfortable even though my daughter is now 22 pounds. The Maya is also less bulky, since there is no padding. I also have no problem nursing in the Maya."
120306,1,"these pacifiers are very nice and the only kind my baby is able to keep in his mouth,love them ,they are so cute."
76508,0,"Overall I think it is a good product. I don't worry about my newborn baby being in the wrong position at night now, I swaddle her and place her in the Inclined to Sleep and she does just fine. I also have used it in bed with my husband and myself, since she sleeps better with us, and I don't worry about the safety issues of cosleeping.HOWEVER, the foam is way too soft and the fabric is cheap. My daughter is only 2 weeks old and the product looks like it has been used for years. I now have to place a folded receiving blanket under the head portion to get the same incline as it was when it was new. Plus she is a long baby, and does tend to wriggle down to the bottom at times, it would be useful if the Inclined to Sleep were longer and had a bottom wedge to prevent sliding down. I usually solve this by having a light blanket over her legs and tucking it in the sides and bottom, and then jamming the bottom of the Inclined to Sleep against the bottom of the bassinet."
91016,1,"Nice product! I love that.I always use this all year ,so I will buy this in the following days ,thank you ."
126827,1,These diapers have been a life saver for us. We tried all the cheap store brands and had nothing but leaks. Thanks Huggies
176542,1,We used Playtex drop-in bottles and my son loved them. He was able to hold them by himself when he was three months old. We started with the slow flow nipple very early and he had nipple confusion. Later we moved on the Y-cut nipple which is great because it doesn't spill like the medium and fast flow.
73887,1,I lived and breathed by this for the first 2 months! Perfect for breast feeding moms especially when it seems like every feeding is running into the next. The nightlight is a great feautre too that we are still using routinely and my son is 3 1/2 months now.
120962,0,"Kushies are nice for people looking for a more economical diaper. I used them when my son was first born because newborns use so many diapers per day and I did not want to spend $15 to $20 each for the more expensive diapers. However, when he was a little older and began using fuzzi bunz pocket diapers and they were so much better. The kushies take a long time to dry, are bulky, hold stains and begin showing signs of wear after only a few weeks."
78058,1,"I bought this highchair over a year ago. We love it most of the time.What we like:-It folds flat, easily. (I honestly don't get the reviews that say it is too much trouble. It takes about 20 seconds, I can do it one handed- that is difficult and I don't recommend it. Easy with two hands)-It wipes clean. Who wants to do laundry every day???-It fits babies of all sizes. It reclines for the very small. It is roomy enough for larger kids. The straps are easy to use. My daughter is tiny(18lbs at 13 months), her cousin is huge(dunno his weight, but he was a 10lb infant and has stayed at the top of the charts- 2years old now). They are both comfortable and safe.What I don't like:-There is a gap between the legs and the seat of the chair. Neither my daughter nor my nephew has gotten stuck, but a friend did. I was able to wiggle her arm free without injury. Still, it is a concern. My daughter cannot reach the gap when the tray is on, so it is not really a big deal.-It does not roll freely. The locks on the front wheel don't actually make the high chair immobile. It just makes it more likely to scratch the floor. I do not roll the chair. I lift it. It is light, but don't plan on rolling your child in it. Even unlocked the chair does not roll easily.All in all, I'd recommend this chair to any parent."
123505,1,this is the greatest playpin i have ever seen. it is much bigger than the regular pac and plays. there are little toys attatched to the sides which makes it great for entertaining. my daughter loves it and so do i.
86451,1,"While I have only used this monitor for about a week now, it works great. I was worried the screen might be too small however it's perfect. It is in color during the day and black and white at night. I can see my baby clearly throughout his whole crib. We have it sitting on his bookcase which is fairly close and he moves around alot.I haven't used the sound on it yet because I can hear him without the monitor. It does have some static but I've used other video monitors and they had static as well. For me, this was good to have so that I could see him when he did start crying to see if I needed to go into his room. My baby is 15 months old and sometimes he wakes up crying and will put himself back to sleep but if I go into his room, then he doesn't want to go to sleep. This monitor just gives me the reassurance to make sure everything is okay. We also have a trailer and will find this very handy when he is in there having his day nap because I can walk outside of the trailer and just clip the monitor onto my pants and still know when he wakes up. We live in a apartment condo and have had no interference even though when I had read the reviews, that was something that was mentioned. I like how the screen shuts off after a short period to save the battery and all you have to do is push the button on top to make it come back on again. Probably the only thing I'm not crazy about is the green light on the camera only because it's a little bright at night. My baby is used to sleeping in complete darkness but this is really a minor thing. This is our 3rd video monitor. The previous two were those TV-like screens...very large...not portable and they both ""died"". The biggest test for this monitor will be how long it works for. If it never breaks down as long as I need it, then I will give it 5 stars! Price was excellent and I'm very, very happy with this purchase."
171030,2,This is terribly cheap and not at all like the picture. The plastic smells funny and sticks together and the fabric on the outside feels like paper.
119298,1,"I have been a faithful My Brest Friend user since my youngest son was born. My lactation consultant told me I'd hate the Boppy brand pillow, and guess what, I did! She sent me out to get a My Brest Friend pillow, so I did.. and it helped me so much. The back support is lovely and the pillow helps keep pressure off your abdomen. This was perfect after my csection! The firm surface makes the pillow easy to use and better support for the baby. Gone are the days where your baby rolls right off those silly crescent shaped pillows. Overall, I can't imagine buying another nursing pillow. I love mine so much, I bought another now that my daughter is nursing. I recommend them to all my friends and family, and typically give them as baby shower gifts to moms I know will be breastfeeding."
124081,2,"I just received this tent today. Not only is it NOT easy to put up or down, but it broke the first time I tried to set it up. Don't waste your money."
101770,1,"This mattress pad has been wonderful. Not one leak of any kind has penetrated this cover. It's very durable, holding up to the washer and the dryer, and still looking brand new. Adds only a touch of cushion between baby & mattress."
100762,1,"We have primarily used Pampers for our son, but often struggle at availability of the specific types of diapers and/or sizes.Subscribing for a continual delivery of Pampers diapers has been the greatest addition to our life. We both work and trying to get to the store to buy diapers is always a juggling act between the two kids and life in general. Through this subscription process, we never have to worry about not having the right diapers as we can adjust the deliveries to meet our timeframes. Additionally, the convenience of coming home to delivered diapers is a blessing!"
125758,1,"The bag is exactly what we wanted and what we need. Lots of compartments and space to transport the essentials needed when out of home with twins.The material used for the bag is perfect as well - tough, easy to clean, resistant.The transaction itself went perfect and can be recommended."
45198,1,This is a great toy. And I loved the interactive toys that you can detach and play with seperately. The only thing negative about this toy that it is a very difficult for an infant to get the mat to play the music without assistance from an adult.
153918,1,"We love these wipes! No weird, chemical smell AND we accidentally threw some in the wash with our cloth diapers and they come out like little fabric washcloths - so we can spray 'em with a little homemade wipes solution and use 'em again - even a couple more times before they fall apart in the wash. Also way cheaper at Amazon then we can get at our local store. Highly recommend!!!"
6051,1,"Well i think that the title almost says all there is!...this stuff does a pretty good job of cleaning up the powerlung, easy to use all you do is add 1 cap-full to about a quart of water and your powerlung sitting in it and it does its job..only thing is it seems really similar to regular soap, i almost think you might be able to get some kind of dye and perfume free soap that is safe for baby's toys like a pacifier or something, although im not sure about that one i just know that that the powerlung people say buy this stuff because it is specially formulated to not damage the sensitive membranes in the powerlung, so for the price i paid for my powerlung sport i definitely don't want to mess it up.. and its not too bad this much will probably last you around a year if you use it sparingly and honestly after that much time you probably need to replace your powerlung anyways if you've been using it regularly."
59688,1,"I read all the reviews on this tub probably a year ago and I HAD to have it. It is expensive to have shipped so I went to a store that carries it to buy it ($25 total). It was WORTH IT. My daughter is now 6 months old and we almost always bathe her in it. I got a cheap bathing sponge to add to the sloped infant side of the tub, and it's perfect. She can lay there without falling. This was true when she was 2 weeks old, and it's true now. She only ever cried when we took her out of it. She can kick and splash with no problem. Even now my daughter is kind of lazy about bath time, she doesn't like to sit up (although she can), so we continue to use the infant side. Sometimes she does enjoy sitting up to splash with her hands, and if she wants to, we can just switch her to the other side. I have plenty of room in my guest/kids bath for this tub on the counter, and room underneath the counter to store it. If you don't have a lot of counter/storage space you may not like this tub as much but it is just perfect for us. We plan to keep it and use it for as long as we can.Update: My daughter is now past 10 months and STILL using this tub. She sits up on the older baby side now. She loves to splash and play and it has plenty of room for that. She has tried to stand up in several times and it is sturdy enough not to tip at all when she does (she weighs about 17 lbs.). I expect to be able to use this tub for several more months. It is GREAT because now she likes to play a lot during baths and I can just stand/sit near her and let her go. I expect we'll use this with our next newborn too! VERY worth it!"
179146,1,"After 19 days of all of a sudden REFUSING the bottle, my 3 month old daughter finally took this bottle!A mother of two, my son never had a problem switching from breastfeeding to bottlefeeding (Avent). I thought my daughter would be the same way as she took the Avent bottle since birth and latched on to the breast without any problem until one day... at 2+ months, she ADAMANTLY REFUSED the bottle.I tried other bottles and nipples, Evenflo, Gerber - rubber, silicone, basic nipple, ergonomic nipple... nothing worked! I tried giving the bottles with just breastmilk, or just formula, and even 1/2 & 1/2. Nothing.Finally decided to try the Ventaire, Naturalshape nipple with only formula AND she drank 4ozs! (She'll also drink breastmilk, or a mix... ) From the looks of it, it looks as if it's easier for her to latch onto the Ventaire naturalshape nipple vs. the other bottle nipples I tried.) Even the Avent nipple which she took as a newborn, she may be refusing because it's a little longer than the Ventaire naturalshape and doesn't have a textured base like the Ventaire.)So far, the bottle hasn't leaked and clean up has been very simple --- and most importantly, she's still taking it.Since I'll be going back to work in a few weeks, it's SUCH a relief to see her finally take a bottle so I wanted to share my story in the event that it may be the solution for other parents out there!"
2472,1,"I'm so happy with my order from Amazon Mom. As a first time mom to 10 wk. old twin boys, not having to run to the store to purchase diapers is AWESOME!! We had to make some extra room in the boys closet to fit the boxes, but my sanity was worth it. I would highly recommend these diapers - they hold in massive amounts of liquid and poop. My boys have never had a diaper rash (knock on wood) thanks to these diapers.I would recommend the Subscribe and Save service to any new mom or a veteran mom who doesn't have a lot of time on her hands."
138476,1,This is a perfect night light that grows with your child. We actually purchased it for our 4.5 year old daughter to use as a night light since it turns off by itself after a short period of time. She loves it. It's very relaxing. I highly recommend!
142090,1,"I like that this is a physical block instead of a chemical sunscreen. We used it all last summer when my daughter was 9 months old, going to the pool & beach several times and she never got burned. Ordered again this year for my now 20-month-old. It goes on a little creamy, but is quickly absorbed."
72535,1,"I really like this potty seat , because is very cute , easy to clean,, light weight , my daughter is very happy to use this and we can took the little seat with us when we go to shopping stores and she feels more comfortable to see this pretty pink seat on a &#34;big seat&#34; ."
48171,1,"When I was reading other reviews, I was nervous about the sheets. However, they wrinkle no more than my pottery barn sheets that we used in his crib! The colors are not bold so beware of that! it is a decent quality bedding set that has withstood numerous washes just fine! There is also cute wall decals and wallpaper border that match!"
148366,1,"I read some info on EC'ing and thought about giving it a try when my daughter is old enough to sit on her own (even though that is not a requirement for EC). Then when my daughter was around 6 months old, she didn't want to poop in her diaper anymore. Every day I'd put her on the changing table, open her diaper, wait, and she'd go shortly after as she lay there. That continued for a week or so and I decided to get a BB Little Potty per recommendation from a mom's forum. I actually got the white one but it is no longer available online so I'm doing my review here since they are essentially the same product except the color.From the time my daughter was 6-1/2 months old till she is 9-1/2 month old, I put her on the Little Potty every time after she wakes up from her nap. If she goes, she goes; if not, no big deal, we try again after the next nap. Well in these 3 months she has pooped in her diaper just four or five times or so, the rest in her Little Potty. It has since been ""retired"" because at 9-1/2 months she has moved on to the BB Toilet Trainer (that goes over a regular toilet seat). Even though she will sit on the toilet when we go out to my friend's house, I keep the Little Potty in my car in case we have to use the public restroom.I actually bought this at BRU because I wanted to check out both the Little Potty and the Potty Chair in person. Even though the Little Potty does not have a back like the Potty Chair, this is a better size for young babies, mainly because it sits lower so the height is just right. My daughter was about 6-1/2 months old when she first sat on the Little Potty and her feet can touch the floor. That helped a lot since she just started to sit on her own a little after her 6th months. Just FYI, she has long legs but she is a thin baby.This might be different for boys, but I have never had a mess with this potty. Everything is contained in the potty every time. And cleaning is very easy. I do pour in some bubble bath wash and water and soak it for a little while after each use before rinsing it clean and it gets rid of any smell very quickly.I highly recommend this product if you are thinking about EC'ing. Keep in mind though that every baby is different - it just happens that mine doesn't like dirty diapers and she's willing to sit on a potty for quite some time if she does need to go.***** ETA Jan 2008 *****Now my son has inherited this and has been using it since he was 2-1/2 months old."
73029,0,I REALLY LIKE MY PURCHASE. I PURCHASED THE DORA PRODUCT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. I WILL RATE THE PRODUCT AGAIN AFTER SHE RECEIVES AND USES IT.
115064,1,"I bought this because we just adopted a yorkie puppywho learned now to scale the smaller gate we had. This gate is sturdy, and tall enough to keep her from climbing over it, and strong enough to not open when she throws herself against it. The only problem I had was that because she was so small, she was able to get in between the bars. I solved this problem by purchasing a sheet of white pegboad, cutting it to fit and attaching it to the gate. It works perfectly, and because I bought white pegboard, it looks alright."
105302,1,"I changed my registry from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after reading the reviews for the Diaper Champ online. I'm very happy with it. Our baby's cradle is in our room so we keep the Champ in there with us. There are no odor problems whatsoever. I also love that you don't have to buy specialty bags for this pail.The only caution I give is to moms with long natural or fake nails...the opening latch doesn't release very smoothly. When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply. I have short nails but I can imagine long nails might get broken or fake ones snapped off if care isn't taken when opening the top.Also, the diaper disposal mechanism, which is great (!!!) since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep. Just be sure to dispose of your diaper(s) before putting baby down to sleep.I would recommend this product to everyone, even with these two very minor issues."
54097,2,"It is a great product from the time you bought it until you get home because it gives Mommy the feeling she has done something for the little ones safety.I installed it because Mommy insisted to do so and there was a tiny, tiny little spark of hope in me that this could actually work. While still installing (which by the way is very simple) my baby (17month) wanted to pull it down already. So here went my hope because I was sure in the first unwatched minute he pulled it down.Well I managed to keep it safe for 24 hours to make sure the tape would dry out and work at its best. Next morning I made scrambled eggs and the tape started to get loose because of the heat. I mean I only used half the heat available and it came loose, didn't even fry some steaks with full power....So my baby enjoyed pulling it down completely and throw it into the trash.While it lasted not long enough to clean it, I am sure it is a real headache to do so."
42763,1,My baby loves the Moby wrap. Settles him instantly and I am free to go about my day and things I need to do with ease. Definitely recommend it!
62925,1,"I ordered this for my wife during her 22nd week after reading a lot of reviews that the 'Mini' would be sufficient for shorter people. It arrived in perfect condition. The mini snoogle was very good at relieving her back pain (which was just about starting), though it doesnt go all the way through the back. The multiple positions of use are pictured in the packaging card, but lacked any detailing. We had to guess which side was up/down since it was quite hidden in the pictures.For the price, would definitely recommend!"
84051,1,"Hi, I just bought this item to use for my daughter who's outgrowing her little carseat. This picture does not justify this car seat at all. The checked fabric looks like cotton to me and seems not hot for summer days, it is combination of brown/black color. The sides are black fabric and cushioned enough. I like most is the lock, it cannot easily unlock by a baby because it needs a little force to unlock it. I paid almost 30% lower than Amazon, got it from a wholesale store:) Overall, I'm satisfied with my buy."
97795,0,"I registered for these bottles bc I thought they were so neat. really they are just a pain in the butt.My son didn't have any problems with gas. He didn't have problems with the nipples either. I use a microwave sterilizer and I used a bottle warmer at first(which I think all parents do until they realize its a waste of time). I occasionally had problems with the bottles leaking but that was mostly when my husband put them together(its not nice to get up for a 3am feeding and find formula all over your refrigerator bc of a leaking bottle)My main problem is that it takes so long to clean these bottles. You have to take them apart,clean all of the pieces, dry the bottom disks and then put them back together. I was gong-ho about the process at first but now that I have a 9 month old running around the house, I don't have the time to do this every time I wash bottles. I recommend evenflo's Comfi' bottles, they are also curved they are just in one piece."
111269,1,This is a great nursing cover! I've had others before and this has more fabric for greater coverage and I love the design at the top - it's really helpful to be able to see to in order to get the baby latched on! A really great product - I wish I'd had one with my first two babies.
46684,2,"My daughter didn't like swinging so the swing got very little use. Even so, the motor stopped working after after 9 months. It would just make a clunking sound. Even when it did work, the buttons were flaky. I would have to push the buttons just right, too hard or too long and the swing would turn on and back off again. When it was running it made excessive noise.For $40 Greco sold me another motor section, but by the time it arrived, my daughter had outgrown the swing so I never used it! I put the swing in storage. Now I have another baby so I got the swing out and found it doesn't work. The motor makes the same clunking noise as the old broken one."
155903,0,"I purchased this item right after I brought my son home from the hospital. I wanted to swaddle him but I found that receiving blankets just weren't big enough and he would wiggle right out of them. However, I found that these didn't exactly ""swaddle"" him as they were more of a wrap. Swaddling is suppose to hold the baby rather snug to simulate the womb and is suppose to be calming, but these were actually too big to get that effect and he had too much wiggle room!!"
144972,1,"I bought this as a gift for a coworker who had twin boys. I filled each basket with children books and small toys and wrapped them in cellophane. I liked the extra ribbons, although I used the white one which is thicker and the same fabric as the liner. The new Mom also preferred the white ribbons."
123576,1,This playpen is a great safe place for the baby to play if you need to put her down for a minute. Also works well as a bed if your traveling and very easy to set up. I'm very happy with the purchase.
87889,1,This is an excellent gift idea and I gave to one of my friends. Nice color and texture and infants will love it!
12894,2,"Most baby stores will allow you to test the product before you purchase it, if that option is given please take advantage of it!!!! I purchased this product and it was a total waste of money!!! I went and found it at my 18th week of pregnancy and the feedback was horrible even at the lower volume levels. Realizing that it may have been to early to hear a heart beat with the monitor I waited until I was at least 24 weeks and still could not hear anything, I then decided to take it to my doctor's office as suggested in the booklet to have him help me find the heart beat. As soon as my doctor saw the product he shook his head and said these products really are not that great. He used the doppler to locate the heart beat and then tried it with the Bebe Sounds Monitor and could not detect anything but he did say he could hear what was going on in the next room. I found out that refunds and exchanges are not excepted!! I will say though that it is a great spy tool but for hearing your child's heart beat GOOD LUCK!! I was very disappointed that I wasted $30 on this product. Next time I will look into purchasing or renting a doppler..."
34935,0,"We could not get this seat to fit properly in the rear-facing position in the back seat of our Toyota Camry. If the seat was to one side, the front seat needed to be completely forward and not usable. The seat just fit in the middle but needed to be propped up unsteadily on towels to be level. We returned it for a Britax Roundabout which fit perfectly on any back seat."
82975,0,My kids both loved the soft seat which made it easy to them seated while potty training BUT the plastic cover that surrounds the soft foam has split on the inside seam. When I wash it or wipe it down water gets in where the split is and everything I am trying to wash away gets caught inside the seat cover. Also the blue lid is not attached well and broke off within days of having it after my toddler pushed back on it. The blue removable step stool and small green splash guard is very useful.
116144,1,"I love love love this high chair. This was my first highchair purchase and I have no regrets (I even bought one for a friend for her baby shower).ProsEasily adjust in height, just step on the orange buttonVery stylishCleans very easilyFoot step is great for older kidsRolls so it moves very easily across tile (of course it will glide less easily on carpet)ConsI have nothing......really I don'tOne more thing, my now one year old son is fairly big. He is in the 95 percentile for his weight and height and I've never had an issue with him fitting in this chair and he's been using this from 5 months."
160621,1,"Before becoming a parent, I didn't realize that changing the fitted sheet on a crib mattress is much more difficult and time-intensive than changing one on an adult-sized mattress. For safety reasons, sheets on crib mattresses fit very tightly and have to be tugged vigorously to get on and off. To put a sheet on securely you have to take the mattress out of the crib, which can be tough because the mattress is wedged tightly against the bars of a crib-- and if you use a crib bumper, this process takes even longer. Finally, if you use the regular system of a fitted sheet + a waterproof mattress pad, there are two layers to change every time the sheets get soiled. The Ultimate Crib Sheet makes crib changes MUCH quicker and more convenient, mainly because the mattress doesn't have to be moved to get the sheet on and off. It also creates less laundry because there's only one layer to wash each time. As a new parent, I find that anything that saves your precious time is a huge asset.As an added side bonus, this sheet can be used as a background for do-it-yourself infant passport photos when your baby is too young to sit up on his/her own and needs to lie down for a photo! Most crib sheets have cute patterns, which look nice normally but can't be used as a solid white background for those pesky passport pictures. I took (valid) passport photos of my baby lying in his crib on this sheet, looking up at his mobile and smiling."
74502,1,"I like both quality and pattern a lot. well cushioned for head and sides. could have more cushion on seat too, but baby looks pretty comfortable sitting on it for quite a while. It fades a little with washing, but I just have to wash it very often. If you have no ""messy"" eater it may look like new for years! And as I mentioned above, I like pattern a lot. It looks so refreshing after surfing through all plaid and solid colors available on the market."
102614,0,"I was so excited to get this mobile because it had lots of movement and colors for my little one to look at! HOWEVER... after only a few uses (less than a week) the mobile stopped turning. My little one loves this mobile (when it works) so I'm determined to make it work, but I feel that the company should have spent the time to make it work properly."
133515,0,The bottles and their system are good but the problem with this product is the silicone nipples! TOO long and it is difficult for the baby to eat.
159389,1,"This was the best gift we received at my shower. Our baby is 6 months now and he is sadly growing to large for it. However, up until now the bouncer has been our life saver. When he was getting cranky or fussy he was very happy to sit in his bouncer. We used it shortly after brining him home from the hospital and would lug it everywhere because it appeased him so much. Friends of ours have a 16month old and he too had the bouncer. He comes over and wants to crawl in it because he likes it so much, also. My girlfriends and I agree this is a great gift for new parents. (It helps when you want to eat dinner as a couple.:)"
63397,0,"My 3 month old son HATES tummy time so I had read reviews that this is a great device to get them interested in laying on their tummy since they have fish/water creatures to watch and push around.Pro: He is entertained and thus is able to spend more time on his tummy than he did before.Con: The water gets COLD after sitting in it for more than a day. I put warm water in, but after sitting for a few days it hit room temperature and feels cold on his face with the plastic covering. When I pick him up from playing with the mat his cheeks are always cold :(A recommendation I would have is to definitely wash the product THOROUGHLY before placing your child on it (as with any baby products). My son loves the water so much he thinks he can eat it so he is constantly putting his mouth on the plastic covering."
113310,2,"You can get 2 pacifiers for the same price from another merchant on Amazon.com. At this price for one, it is far more expensive than what a local pharmacy charges."
25692,2,"I thought product would support head from falling forward while the baby slept. IT DOES NOT! All car seats support head on each side so I did not need item for that reason. Not only does it not support the head, it increases the possibility of the head falling forward.I contacted the seller to return product and was told I would have to pay a variety of fees to return the product. I replied back that it was not fair that I had to pay fees if the product is not working as advertised and the seller wrote back that if I have a problem I should call the manufacturer. This is the worst customer service I have experienced. If a product is not working as advertised, the seller provides the refund. I have never been told to contact manufacturer if I am not satisfied."
54285,2,"I bought this because it plays for 15 minutes and my wind up only lasted for about 2 minutes before I had to go wind it up again. I also thought you couldn't go wrong with classical music. I expected that they would have chosen better known songs than what they did; I don't like any of the 3 songs. The mobile circles around on a slant, and they have 3 pieces on each arm that slide up and down as it goes around. They make a scraping noise that my husband and I did not care for at all. It was also not as easy to attach securely to the crib - the top piece (the yellow hook) is flexible and does not stay hooked over the crib as well as other mobiles. The motor is also rather loud. I returned this and bought a different type. My son liked it, but he likes his new one too."
5856,1,Pros:Economy pack - has enough outlet plug cover for the main rooms. I would suggest a bigger pack for 2 story home.Design/look not bad.Competitively priced.Cons:Not very easy to remove from the plug.Design/look not bad (meaning - have seen better)
165679,1,"Product as order, quick shipement. Diapers, comes in long vacuum sealed packs like they would if you bought from store. Would and Have brought again, just bigger size!"
76879,2,I do not like this product at all. It's not very safe and the tray is a real inconvenience. My 2 month old son fell out of it when I was about to fasten the tray in. I was lucky he was not hurt because I was there to catch him. I do not recommend this product.
51939,1,"I tried three different slings/carriers before I found this wonder. They all either made baby fussy or bound up her feet or were uncomfortable on my back. We've now had this carrier for four months now (she's six months old) and I still love it. It's easy to adjust for her growth, the straps are easy on your back and shoulders, and she doesn't overheat."
88498,2,"The neck support for the newborn position didn't like to stay put and my poor baby's neck flopped around. Now that he is a little older and faces out, the neck support is support flap is supposed to tuck under, but it keeps getting in the way. Alex just chews on it when it doesn't shimmy up over his eyes. I haven't tried it on my back yet. The whole system is a bit uncomfortable for me, but better than some I've tried. If you lean forward just a little, the baby flops away from you, though. I must admit, I don't know what I'd do without it while watching both my baby and my sister's 11-month old, though!"
114202,1,I've had this booster seat through two kids now. It folds compactly for travel (if you have a stow n' go type vehicle it will fit easily into floor compartment out of sight). I highly recommend this product!
103595,2,"today i returned this item to the store where i bought it. originally we purchased it for our 17 month old so that we would have a chair for visiting family and friends. it worked perfectly until the last few weeks as at 20 months now our daughter has grown up to be 30 lbs. im not sure about any weight restrictions for the chair, but two weeks ago she leaned forward and the strap pulled straight through the plastic part of the chair that is supposed to ground it. just a few days ago she was sitting in the chair eating when out of the blue - the seat let go from level 3 and landed on the cusion of the chair below it. luckily she was not injured however i would reccommend this chair not be used by any child of 30 pounds. infact, i would reccomend a few changes to the safety of this product such as a more dependable method of securing the safety straps to the seat itself in back. another suggestion would be to secure the seat itself to the sides of the chair in a way that was less likely to give way under 30 pounds - even if the child kicks her feet or wiggles.this is a fantastic chair if those two areas were addressed. i loved the style and the portability of it, i love the tray being attached and the fact that it could go in the dishwasher. the only other thing i would reccommend is a portable bag to take it along so that the owner doesnt have to fuss with the straps etc. parents have so much to do already."
156364,1,Bought this for my granddaughter to keep her warm on those cold winter nights. It works great. I used to buy these for the kids when they were babies. So excited to see they now come in larger sizes for toddlers. Love that it's got room for legs to extend out of bottom so she can walk around.
126116,1,"I have tried different diapers such as pampers and members mark but non compare to Huggies. My child would get rashes when I would switch to another brand. Not only that, they would also leak during the night. Not with these diapers. My baby seems more comfortable and these never leak. I wouldn't recommend any other diaper."
11897,0,"I liked this product because, by about 6 months, I could pop a chunk of banana or avacado or whatever into the feeders and hand one to each of the twins. However, the inventor claims that this is &quot;not messy&quot; and &quot;easy to clean.&quot; I beg to differ. Besides making it easy for the babies to chomp on the food, it also makes it easy for them to paint with it... on whatever surface (or pet) is near by. They got it everywhere! I certainly would never have let them chew on it in the car, as the product insert suggests, because both car seats and both babies would have needed to be hosed down by the time we reached our destination. As for it being easy to clean, yes you can put it in the dishwasher, but that doesn't get the food out from under the rim. The mesh also gets stained very quickly, so if you can't stand handing your little one something that looks brown and dirty to chew on (even if it's really just out of the dishwasher) then probably this product is not for you. The bottom line... I used them for a month or two, until the girls developed the ability to pick up small peices of food and get them (at least some of them) into their mouths. But during that time, they were really useful, especially with twins."
105998,1,"We love this diaper pail. It is so easy to use and looks nice in my sons room. We bought this diaper pail because we didn't want to hassel with special bags. However, as my son began to ate solid foods his diapers began to change. The odor initally was a problem, but we have since solved it. I now use the odor free trash bags and haven't had a problem since. I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers. We would recommend this, but with the use of odor free trash bags. They don't cost more than regular bags and since you still need to use a bag, there really is no hassel."
82224,1,"Pushing from the side and twisting isn't a very natural effort. But maybe that's a good thing if you want to keep kids out. It's certainly not at all intuitive given what looks like a nice round button in front.Like a previous reviewer stated, you'll need about 2"" to 2.5"" of space to get the lock in and your fingers around it. What this means for us is that we could only choose to use it on a certain side and we'll have to train ourselves to spin the lazy susan in a different direction from now on. The spacer, which eliminates door jiggling works great. Now if only they could design the lock so that the door could still spin freely in both directions when unlocked!Incidently, the instructions recommend pre-drilling with a 1/16"" bit but we found a 3/32"" bit worked better... especially since it is hard to get leverage on the screw and the screw head strips easily if one is not careful.Good luck!"
136733,1,"My 10 week old son can be fussy, tired, overtired, or just cranky and this toy can always calm him down. He loves this thing above all else he owns, so I do too. He even has learned to turn it on himself!"
165402,0,"It's not a bad diaper, but it does absorb a lot less than the Cruisers. My son drinks a lot of fluid, and therefore also pees quite a bit. The Baby Dry needs to be changed out more often to avoid leaks than the Cruisers, but it is a bit cheaper. However, I really don't think the tiny little price savings is worth it considering the extra effort and the extra cost of using more diapers."
141819,2,"This was not a good buy for us. It is totally worthless and I think it made the problem worse. One of our 9 month old twin as soon as it could stand, discovered that the crib rail is a perfect teething toy... After reviewing various products we selected the Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail. We followed all the instructions for installation but the product does not work. Our kid can just fit his bottom teeth (he only has these 2) between the crib rail and the side of the cushion and continue to scrap the crib rail. And now that the top part of the rail is cushioned, I think he enjoys it even more... So this product does not protect our son from continuing to scrap the crib finish and ingest it. Back to the drawing board and a hunt for another product. I do not recommend this one."
133555,0,"This product is a Great Idea -- it allows you to use a single stroller you already have and convert it into a Sit n' Stand without much extra bulk. My son absolutely loves to sit on it, it's very easy to steer, and it's very easy to attach and detach as needed. It does need some improvements. The issues I have are as follows: There is no place for kids to ""hold on"" while sitting, except the sides; however, since the sides are not real handles, it would be fairly easy for a child to let go. The next issue is that there are no safety straps to secure a child -- so while I push the stroller, I'm always concerned that my son may fall off. Thirdly, the seat takes up extra space in the front of the stroller and without being able to also elongate the handle bars on my stroller, I am constantly bumping my shins into the attachment. I think the manufacturer should consider making a handle extender. I recommend waiting until they improve this product with some extra safety features -- in the meantime, go for the Caboose or Sit n Stand."
147732,2,"My husband bought this seat for our son who was born in August 2004. His criteria for purchasing the unit was that it fit snug in the base and didn't wobble about, which it doesn't. This is one of the features that I liked and the one reason that I kept the seat. Our car seat from our first baby, which was 3 years old, didn't work in the minivan that we purchased and we didn't find this out until it was too late. This car seat was purchased on the day he was to bring us home from the hospital so I never had a say in what we were purchasing and have lived with this seat though I have actually hated it from the start. The belt clip was too big and I constantly felt like I was pinning my newborn into his seat. It doesn't seem so bad now, but 4 months have passed since we bought it. Also, it has always seemed to narrow and I have constantly felt like I was and am still wedging my baby into his seat. Also, I never used the crotch protector or the other pieces for the straps. It was just far to cumbersome and stiff to work with. In addition the fabric doesn't breath and my son is constantly sweating and getting overheated from being in his seat. Also, you have to really push down on the unit to lock it in place. After almost getting rearended I found much to my greatest fear that the seat hadn't locked into place properly and my son would have been seriously injured if we had gotten hit. I should have returned the seat at that time, but instead I just make certain it is securely locked down before the van is in motion. I am just glad that he has almost outgrown this seat."
178558,1,"I bought 4 carriers: Baby Bjorn, Ergo Baby, Belle Baby, and Baby Hawk to try. Baby Bjorn is the only one I am going to keep, as I felt it was easiest to use and get on quickly. Also, my baby (13 lbs.) fit the best in the bjorn. She is a smaller baby, and I felt that she was not as secure in the other carriers. The fabric on this carrier is very soft, and it feels nice for me and baby. My little girl seems to like it too!"
63738,1,"I really love this high chair, nice colors, easy to clean, lightweight, has smaller tray on top of the regular tray for easier cleaning, comes with two toys that you can remove and are inter changeable with other graco products. My only complaint is that it doesn't fold up very flat, the foot guard sticks out quite a bit."
52162,2,"I purchased this car seat for my car for my granddaughter. I read the reviews, I comparison shopped and thought I had gotten a great buy. My great buy was not as great as I thought. I experienced a very difficult time installing this car seat into my 2007 Honda Civic. No matter what I did, I could not get the car seat installed securely. I used the latch system and followed the directions to the letter. My daughter had installed her Britax with no problem. I ended up making an appointment with the State Police and they installed it properly and securely. The trooper was not very happy when I told him the make of the car seat I had purchased. He told me I should have invested the extra money and purchased a Britax. My recommendation is this: If it doesn't install in your vehicle easily and properly, return it !"
182000,1,"We couldn't get this thing out of the box fast enough for our son. He didn't even wait for me to get it fully assembled before he was trying to stand at it to pee like Daddy! Once we got it completely put together --E-Z, E-Z, btw -- and with water in it to flush, our little champ striped off his clothes (even tried taking off his shirt, hee-hee!) and flushed it over and over. This began what was almost a 2-week long nightly ritual until a week or so ago. He was standing there flushing and actually started peeing! Now he pees about 50% of the time when he's standing there flushing before his bath and we haven't even really started truly potty learning yet. It seems he is/will be ready before we are -- AMAZING!!!"
62667,1,"I'm not the type of person to throw out the trash every time there is a smelly diaper in it. I find the diaper Genie great because not only can it hold at least 4-5 big diapers .. it definitly contains the smell. My daughter is 8 months old and is already eating solid food (cereal..etc.) and we have had no problems with regards to the diaper Genie containing smell.- I don't like buying the refills either on a constant basis that is why i only gave this item a 4, however i will keep buying the refills for now because i think the good definitly outweighs the expense."
137104,1,"Our baby would never take a paci if it weren't for soothies!! Yeahhhh soothie! Bottles are great. We switched to the soothie bottle just because our son was confusing the nipple on his bottles and his paci. We need him to keep taking his paci so we are thrilled to have the soothie bottle with the same nipple. No complaints, they work great.Not sure why the other reviewer only gave 4 stars...if you don't screw ANY bottle on tight enough, it leaks! ...DUH!"
102599,1,Great mobile! It is a little quiet but it's for helping a baby relax and sleep so it really shouldn't be that loud.
162052,2,"This tub sounded like a good idea when I registered for it, but I realized soon after that it was not what it seemed to be. First of all, it leaked after a few months of use. We thought it was due to it not being locked properly, but we relocked it and it did no good. Secondly, it seems like you could use this tub for many stages of your baby's life, but you really can't use it for very long at all (at least not for us). The tub only works in ONE position, you can't make it smaller like it looks. And by the time your baby gets old enough to move around he doesn't want to be confined to a seat anymore. The one nice thing is the soft incline that you get with it, but the tub is so long, you have to really watch the baby and keep him/her from sliding forward and down under water. So, I really did not like this tub."
13268,0,"Ok, I have read most of the reviews on this item. But first let start from the beginning.I came across the mighty tite while buying a second carseat. I thought I would try it out just to see since carseats can be a pain. I found it easy to use and very secure. Also worth the price. I was so happy with it I went to buy another one but they were sold out.Just out of bordem I thought I would search online, maybe get a cheaper price, and here I am. I read the reviews and found out very quickly that I needed to give my carseat more effort. I went outside and did my carseat with all my effort I had at 2:00 am and found the car seat was perfectly tight without the mighty tite.I still don't know where I stand. Everyone has made great points but in the end I feel like this. If an extra device has to be used to safen a safety product, something is being overlooked. In my case it was just time and effort I was putting in...my carseat is great!!! go evenflo triumph 5!!...{{shameless plug!}}.Before you buy the mighty tite make sure YOU have done EVERYTHING you can to make it the seat tight. We dont pay hundreds of dollars on them for nothing. And also make the decision for you and your child. If it gives you peace of mind good for you, but I can't ignore my gut feeling."
145717,1,Looks great.. It would have been great if had the option of castor wheels as well so the kid could use it as a walker as well if needed.
136736,1,"I was having a huge problem getting my son to sleep in his own room. However, when I put the Dreamscape Soother in his crib he would fall right to sleep. Now he sleeps in there all night every night. This product also has a night light and a volume control button which are two excellent items to have at night. Great product!!!"
106032,2,"In my opinion the Diaper Champ was very poorly constructed and was a complete waste of my money. Here are a list of problems that I experienced while using cloth diapers in the Champ...1. The base does not open easily...usually you have to keep exerting force until the lid finally slams open. (If your toes happen to be in the way, the heavy, diaper-filled base is soooo painful as it snaps back down on top of your foot.)2. After you finally open the lid and you try to replace the bag, the lid does not stay propped open on its own. You almost need a second person to hold the lid open while installing the clean plastic bag. If you don't get the bag installed correctly the first time, this means that the bag will fall into the pail and you will end up with dirty diapers outside of the bag in the pail.3. The Champ only holds about 20 cloth diapers, so the bag needs to be replaced too frequently. If you don't replace the bag when imediately when needed the receptacle gets jammed. Typically each tall kitchen garbage bag is only 1/5 full when it needs to be replaced. (It is a hassle and not very environmentally friendly.) If you are using a diaper service, this also means that you will need to find a place to store these extra bags of dirty diapers while you are waiting for the weekly diaper pick-up. YUK!4. The receptacle gets jammed regularly, so I need to stick my hand down the disposal hole in order to push the diaper completely down into the diaper holding tank. Since I am using cloth diapers, each day I find myself sticking my hand into a wet/poopy plastic hole while trying to pry a wet diaper down to the bottom of the receptacle hole so it will fall into the base.5. The receptacle hole collects urine and stool as the diapers are inserted into the hole. It stinks so it needs to be cleaned every week or it will make your baby's room smell.If you are using cloth diapers my recommendation is to purchase an old fashioned diaper pail, plastic, with a lid and is provided by most diaper services). The cheaper pail will hold more diapers, it is easier to use, it costs less and it smells better. Don't waste your $$$ on the Champ if you are using cloth diapers."
121204,0,This was great but I had an issue with the fact that my child's legs were hanging off the edge...even as a newborn.I liked the little mirror and the bunny. The music and vibrations were obviously what we were looking for and this was fine for that. Just the length was an issue. I have tried others and didn't have the same problem.
33593,0,"I have an older version of this same gate, which has worked perfectly fine for us. I ordered two additional gates as puppy gates and am a bit disappointed. One was damaged during shipping, however not worth the cost to return it for a replacement (nor worth the carbon expense to do so).They are extremely difficult to operate and I cannot get one to lock into place.For $14, I guess this is what I should have expected. I really miss the days when companies took pride in their products and provided a quality item for consumers."
40258,1,"We have used Pampers on our son since he was born -- first, the Pampers Swaddlers size N (so soft and tiny!), then the Pampers Swaddlers size 1 (so soft!), then the Pampers Swaddlers size 1-2 (so soft!), then the Pampers Swaddlers size 2 (so soft!), but the Swaddlers ended there (so sad!)...so, we moved on to Pampers Cruisers size 3, and now we are on Pampers Cruisers size 4. I can count on one hand the number of times he has leaked through/blown out of a Pampers diaper. They are great diapers - high quality and good design. Love the cute Sesame Street characters on them, and so does our son. I recommend buying these in [...]- best value. [...]"
9454,1,"Our 2-year-old-son is being potty trained using one of these chairs in each of our bathrooms. He's very large for his age, around 40"" tall and 37lbs. He fits on the chairs with no problem, seems very comfortable on them, and they have been working great for us. They're very easy to clean, and the splash guard is useful, although it's not a substitute for gentle reminders to point the, erm, ""hose"" down when he's sitting down to pee. The grips on the bottom seem to work well on our tile/vinyl flooring. Definitely recommend."
44427,0,Installation of the bedrail was very easy to install by just running the straps between the mattress & box spring & it is very sturdy so my little one will never fall. The problem we have is that the clips on the poles to lower the rail so you can actually have access to put your child in bed or to change the bed was pratically impossible to use. There were no handles to hold and you had to grab the clips directly and they are small (my wife could not even do it because the springs were too string and she could not hold it securely).
123060,2,"I bought this potty seat for my son and when I put the batteries in it the batteries (which were brand new) the back of the battery compartment got dangeroulsy hot and when I opened it to take the batteries out the batteries were exploding! I am returning it where I purchased it. Unless this was a defective one, I would not recommend this at all."
22547,0,"I do not like the Graco Pack 'N Play. My Mom borrowed two for our visit so that I didn't have to bring mine, (two so that there would be one upstairs and one downstairs)and I do not like them at all. The bottom isn't very solid and the sides squeak and creak! I'm short so I can't bend over the side without leaning on it a little bit, and my son is a light sleeper, so every time I try to lay him down I have to be VERY careful not to hit the side or it creaks and wakes him up. It's decent, I guess. Does the job, keeps my son contained. But could be better. I have theEddie Bauer Vanderbilt Complete Care Play Yardat home and the bottom is more solid and the sides do not creak."
184294,1,"It has sturdy sides to keep mom and dad off of it but enough mesh to allow air flow. I definitely recommend this to keep your baby close while you sleep. It folds up and is easy to transport for a nap away from home, too."
118890,0,The chair itself is sturdy but after one month the plastic buckle broke. It is not repairable and it will be hard to put something else there in its place. Now I feel it is unsafe for my 16 month old.
61023,2,My husband and I bought this product before we had our baby. I clean the diaper genie before I refill the bag. This item still stinks after a year of cleaning it. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
144996,1,everything was great the packaging wasnt bad it came in secure plastic my daughter will love it i will be purchasing more items in the future. thanks
102973,0,"My husband is thrilled with this stroller after hunching over many others we've owned. But I'm not as happy. 3 things that drive me nuts so far:1. It's not so easy to open. I end up having to adjust two areas just to open it properly. He has no problems though, so maybe it's just me.2. The seat part has to be adjusted every time so that the 2 year old can put her feet on the foot rest. It automatically goes back to sticking straight out everytime it's opened. I guess it's nice that it's adjustable, but right now it's a pain because the baby isn't in it yet.3. They might as well have put a lid on the basket because it's impossible to put ANYTHING in it except something tiny. The bars criss cross over the basket which limits access to it. If you click on the larger image you may see what I mean.Other than that, it's the best one we tried out. I would recommend going into a store like Buy buy baby and trying all the high end strollers and really play with them. Open them, close them, lug them and try putting your diaper bag in it. Oh and if you have the kid outside of your body, try throwing them in it too ( pay attention to how it buckles). Basically, do all of the things you would be doing if you owned it.***Update***It is now July of '09 and I have to once again, up the stars on one of my reviews. I now give the stroller a 4 star rating. I can hold my monster of a baby and close the stroller with one hand. I feel like a 'she-woman' when I do it but hey you gotta do what you gotta do! It's still bulky and the under storage stinks but we've abused it and it's still kickin'. I would have liked to buy the Maclaren but we're too tall for it."
39024,1,"I love this cover - it's a perfect fit for my chubby little boy. No leaks, even overnight (with a prefold and doubler). The snaps are great, much better than velcro. I'll never go back to covers with hook-and-loop fasteners. Baby boy can't take his diaper covers off any more!"
179942,1,"Yes, I'm a little bit late with this review but i hope you'll find it of some use.From a man perpective, this is by faaaaaaaaar the very best and beyond!!!I bought this one as a gift for my Goddaughter which I love more than life and wanted her and her father and mother to be with me whenever possible but I have a cabrio bimmer and the trunk it's veeeery small... guess what? it is possible to put this stroller in my car's little trunk without a single problem while the stroller stills has all the advantages of bigger ones... it's a full featured thing that looks gorgeous, very modern, easy to use (even for me), light (even for mom) and not so expensive!!!If you're a modern mom, dad or godfather just buy it!!! you can't go wrong... if you're a contemporary one... buy it!!! you'll never regret, but above all... if you have a sport car and still want to be a responsible, sensible mom, dad or goddad... it's the only one in the world... new models as well (bought two newer versions for my Goddaughter's sister)Durability? no problem either... it lasts a lifetime, if you buy it for your first baby you can still use it for your second one without a problem unless you're like me and want your loved one to be up to date in fashion all the time :)JP"
35301,1,"I bought these curtains for my daughter's room. At first I wasn't sure if I liked them, then after they were put up, I thought they were the perfect touch to the room. Good buy*"
81353,0,"I ordered this stroller after i couldn't make up my mind on what to get or how much to spend. The price is right for this stroller. It is light and easy to get in and out of the car. One big factor of why i liked the Graco products is the easy design of the staps and buckle. Some of the other brands are so difficult to do and undo with a squirmy little one. The basket below the seat is very spacious and can fit lots of shopping bags. It was easy to assemble with good instructions (really just putting the wheels and trays on). Many of the other reviews mentions the placement of the bar right behind the baby's head, but so far this hasn't been an issue, but i can see as he gets older/taller how it might be (my son is just about 12 months). My mother-in-law has a slightly bigger version of the graco storller (glider-something) and that is a bit taller, which would have been nice for this stroller, but i guess it is a trade off between the weight and size of the stroller. I would definately pruchase this stroller again!"
28701,1,"Nice chair for the price. Comfy, color matched our cherry crib perfectly. Love that it came with an ottoman. Easy to assemble."
64608,1,"This baby bag is very convenient and at the same time is fashionable. I bought a big brand purse in order to avoid the typical baby bags.... but it was difficult to find things.... with this bag, everything is reachable and in place! I so recommend it!"
101603,1,"I love this bottle rack! It is sturdy enough for glass bottles (though I've only used it with 5oz ones) and I can easily hold all of the bottles, nipples and other bits and pieces that I want to wash for my baby. The brush works well and it's nice to be able to ""hide"" it back in it's slot when not in use. The rack attractive so I don't mind having it sitting on my counter top. I haven't had an issue with water pooling that some other reviewers encountered. Couldn't live without it!"
26496,0,"I love the bassinet it was a shower gift i received it on Sept. 25th, 2004. I immediately order extra sheets the next day as a previous reviewer has advised. My baby was due on November 7th 2004 and arrived on Nov. 10th, however yesterday March 7th, 2005 I received a letter stating there would be a further delay of 6 to 8 weeks wait for the sheets I ordered nearly 6 months ago. This is an absolute disgrace and i would advise everyone to be prepared to sew your own sheets unless you are only in the planning stages of getting pregnant."
72869,1,"We actually tried another booster first that did not meet our needs. This booster is collapsible, but is still very sturdy when fully expanded. The booster can also act like a chair when the tray is not attached. This will be my daughter's first chair at the dining room table when she is older. Another benefit for us is that there is no post or pole from the tray to the chair. This helps to prevent babies who like to &#34;grind&#34; through meals."
73583,2,"I wish I would have read some of the negative reviews before buying this simply on the positive ones. This poorly built little device worked fine for almost 2 months before it just died. The display just went blank. Of course, my first thought was that the batteries were dead. After replacing them with new batteries, the display showed a bunch of partial digits, then faded away. If I paid 5 dollars, I probably wouldn't care as much. Before buying this, READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, not just the positive ones."
117776,1,"This jumper seat works great. Very sturdy, and lots of bounce for our little one. The tray is a bonus as you can put toys on it. Would definitely recommend."
170683,1,"This isn't a bad chair, but it's different from the one shown in the photo in that the adjustment knobs are black plastic, not wood. Two knobs are used to adjust tension on the tray to prevent it from sliding, and the other two are used to hold the seat and footrest in place. There are two ugly metal L-brackets holding the backrest in place.On the plus side, assembly is easy and requires only a philips screwdriver and the included hex keys. My 5-month-old watched me put it together from his Bumbo seat without getting too bored. Overall it looks nice, especially compared to the typical plastic high chair. I got an incredible gold box deal on this item; I don't think it's worth full price."
77313,0,nice cradle but for some reason my grandson doesnt care for it. the handmedown bouncer works better. if u know someone with one test drive first before spending the money
26571,1,"The bassinet is a baby shower gift from my sister. Although my baby shower is not until the end of June, my sister decided to start purchasing items off my registery. This bassinet was the most difficult item to find...my sister called 4 different babiesrus stores in our area and everyone was sold out of this product. After weeks of waiting, we were finally we were able to locate it. This bassinet is great for a boy or girl. I love the features which include: lock or unlock to rock as well as the musical option. My husband has yet to put the bassinet together (baby's estimated due date is August), that is why I give this product 4 stars but I am sure that it is worth 5 stars!!"
126596,0,"they are a little scratchy and they let out the jelly too easily. when i change my daughter after she pees, every time there is jelly all over. Normally we use the snugglers and that doesnt happen"
165387,1,I always like Pampers. They are soft and gives good comfort for my baby boy.I highly recommend this product to everyone.
34656,1,"The sheets didn't fit my bassinet very well, maybe it was too rounded. But the sheets were nice, very basic."
93091,1,"This is a great option AND great deal for any time you travel with a toddler or pre-schooler. Our son in 4- average size- and I can see him using this for at least another year- possibly two. We travel a lot, and had been using the One Step Ahead Travel 'n Trundle bed, which is really not more than a very thin mat, with ""sides"" that velcro on. I didn't think it could possibly be comfortable at all, so when traveling for our last adventure, wanted to see if I could find another option. This was perfect. The ONLY flaws that I see are: There is a support strap in dead center- going across that stays up higher than the rest of the cot. SO...it would be like having a ""soft"" metal bar in a sleeper sofa, in the middle of your back to sleep. He seemed to sleep fine in it, but I do think there must be a way to fix that problem. Last problem is that the travel bag it comes in does not have a carrying handle- which seems weird. It is very compact, and much like the size of a fold up camping chair- so very convenient.Overall- a very good buy, and a much better and cheaper option than what we were using before!"
183531,1,This pewter baby cup comes quickly and makes a great gift. For the price it is a great value. I wouldn't have it shipped direct to give it a better presentation (packaging).
78934,0,Really helps keep your stuff all together when traveling with a toddler. It made getting through airport security a little tough but getting from security to the terminal was a lot easier.
88577,1,"I was so happy with these diapers. The box lasted for a lot longer than what I actually thought it would. The diapers are amazing and do really well with holding in leaks and messes. They are super absorbant and have really cute sesame street designs on the front. I was impressed with the overall shape, fit, and look of the diaper and will be purchasing more. I am recently new to buying diapers off of Amazon; however, with the savings, variety of options, and having it delivered to my door, it just can't be beat!!"
88245,0,"I was expecting the bag to be a little wider but it fell short on that end. You can only fit a few small essentials. I tried to roll a baby blanket but it was too thick to go into the bag. You will have to take out some of the items in order to get to the other ones at the bottom. I was better off using the free diaper bags they give at the hospital from the baby formula companies. They can fit more things than this bag did. The two top zippered compartments were too shallow for things other than your keys, lipstick, and a small wallet. The bag itself does not have zippered closure so the stuff in it is exposed. Not an ideal diaper bag for a whole day trip out and about."
21530,2,"The bars tighten but loosen when the tub gets wet, my 14 month old has been able to pull the thing down and has on one occasion used the top bar to pull herself up causing the thing to collapse sending her face down into the water, could have been very dangerous. If using this, ALWAYS be within arms reach. Disappointing."
127727,1,"This is one of my favorite purchases I have made for my toddler. I was a little worried since the railing only goes half way through. I thought she would for sure fall out since she is constantly moving around. I was wrong. She has been sleeping in it for 6+ months now and has been doing fantastic. The only downside is that we are already thinking that we will will move her to a larger bed because she thinks she needs to bring a bunch of toys with her to bed. We will take them out of bed but when we leave she will go get more-dolls, stuffed animals, book, etc. We have a bedroom set that is Espresso and I was worried it wouldn't match, but it blended just fine. I am 165#s and have sat with her multiple times to read her stories and it holds us just fine. Would buy again!"
107069,1,WORKS VERY WELL!! DOES WHAT IT SAYS!!
22897,1,"Love this sling... I even got the one in the picture - green/white. My son loves it, it's the only one I use... and I was one of those mom's that went out and got them all and this is my go to baby carrier. When you don't need it just stuff it in your bag... and when you need it it's right there. easy, cute, and my baby loves it... enough said."
44859,1,"Speed & QuantityAs one who expressed 30-ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy I can attest to the speed, and efficiency of the Pump In Style. While on vacation, I misplaced the membranes to the Pump In Style, which are vital for operation. Considering my breasts were ready to burst, I purchased an Avent Isis hand pump. The Isis was great in a pinch, or for a weekend away; however, the Pump In Style was superior in speed and quantity. With the Pump in Style I expressed 16-ounces in 20 minutes, whereas it took me 30 to 40-minutes to express 10-ounces with the Isis.ComfortUsing a breast pump takes time and practice. It can also be painful especially if your nipples are cracked and bleeding. I used the PurLan breast cream after each session, so I never experienced discomfort. The Pump In Style accommodates small and large chests alike. Small breast shields are provided as well as large breast shields for optimum suction, and comfort. The suction is adjustable, and it's recommended that one start with the lowest of speeds. I quickly graduated to the highest speed, which made for very effective pumping.Set-up & CleaningSetting up the Pump In Style is a breeze compared to the Isis pump. There are 5-simple steps in all, and it takes 2 to 3-minutes tops. Make sure the tubing is fitted securely, and that the membranes are dry, and laying flat. Start pumping. After each session, disassemble and wash. Most of the parts in the accessory kit are dishwasher safe, and can be used in a steam sterilizer as well. Although, the membranes and tubing should be hand washed only. If running through the dishwasher, store the valves in a basket for protection from the heating element.StoringThe Pump In Style includes a built-in insulated compartment with zipper enclosure. The compartment stores up to 20-ounces of breast milk. 3-rectangular cooling packs keep the breast milk cold for hours. Medela includes 20-CSF collection bags for storing, which I bought separately. They feature measurement indicators in both milliliters, and ounces. Labels are included as well, so the date can be recorded. I do not recommend storing full bags in the insulated compartment as it has the potential for making a huge mess. They should go right into the freezer, or refrigerator. I didn't like the twist tie assembly, so I used them for stock piling frozen breast milk. The bags are durable, and they freeze well; although, I had a difficult time propping them up so they wouldn't fall. Spilled breast milk is something to cry about.Breast milk can be stored in the refrigerator, or in the freezer. Freshly expressed milk may stand at room temperature for up to 4-hours; however, it should be refrigerated if temperatures exceed 77. Breast milk will remain fresh in the refrigerator for up to a week. One may store expressed milk in a self-contained freezer for up to 4-months, and up to 1-year in a deep freezer. Frozen breast milk can be defrosted in the refrigerator, in a bottle warmer, or at the tap. Never re-freeze thawed breast milk.PortableThe Pump In Style is a working moms dream. One can pump between meetings, and store in the refrigerator, or in the built-in insulator. If storing breast milk in the refrigerator at work, be sure to mark it, as others may be tempted to flavor their coffee unknowingly. The pump and all its parts weighs 7-lbs. This isn't heavy, but when loaded with 3-frozen ice packs, and 4-full bottles it can weigh up to 12 pounds. The weight was rarely a problem for me, but it's something to consider if carrying a fully loaded breast pump, a newborn, a diaper bag, and a purse. The battery pack is great for on-the-go pumping, but it eats batteries, so I didn't use it much. Oh, and on the road pumping with the vehicle lighter adapter is available for an additional fee. I would have definitely invested in one had I known about it.In evaluating this breast pump, there are so many positives it's actually difficult for me to find negatives. Therefore, I believe the benefits outweigh any objectionable points. If asked to present a con, I would suggest the following. Upon occasion, breast milk will leak into the tubing. This isn't a huge issue. All you do is remove the tubing, and soak it in warm soapy water. Hang the tubing to dry. If dried breast milk is discovered in the tubes, then disinfect them by boiling in a pan of water. Hang the tubing to dry. Thus, I found it best to sit up straight when pumping. For me, this pump was a way for me to offer my son breastmilk, so I definitely recommmend it!"
93745,1,"This was a great product...unfortunately it's more for little bitty infants and my son (6 weeks at the time) was already too long for it. It was also really REALLY full of cushion, too much so for my short torso (so it raised my baby too high for a proper reach while nursing). I just ended up using the detachable portion of the pillow by itself to give my elbow a little cushion while nursing. All in all a great product for tiny babies, just not the best for me."
45639,1,"When we purchased this I kept wondering if it would really be worth it. Almost $50 for some dumb little colorful blanket and toys hanging down from it? But, it had such good reviews, I gave it a shot. So happy that I did! My little girl is now 6 weeks old and loves this play mat! It's a lifesaver when she's up at 3 am and I'm about to pass over from exhaustion. I can lay her down and she will entertain herself for up to an hour, just looking at the toys. Every now and then she will spot herself in the mirror and stare like she's in shock. Love the little details to the toys, mat, and the lights. She hasn't been able to fully take advantage of it yet being so young so I'm excited to watch her grow and learn to play with it more. I guess the little things are a lot more exciting when you're new to the world :)At first I thought the music was too quiet... but when I laid down beside her it seemed just the right volume for her. I do get a little annoyed that it plays the same song over and over."
135915,2,"These bottles are horrible!! My son had bad gas so we tried these. They did work great for the gas, but one of the bottles in the 3-pack did not assemble correctly and leaked terribly. They also took FOREVER to clean and assemble.. not fun when you have a hungry infant crying for his food!Here's the kicker.. I boiled all the parts every day, and cleaned them thoroughly every time with the enclosed brush, but two weeks later I noticed some MOLD growing on all 3 of the beige peices. I cut open one of them and was disgusted to find a layer of brownish green mold coating the inside! No wonder he'd been having screaming episodes and started spitting up!!I felt like a horrible mother for using these bottles!If you want to prevent GAS, use Playtex nursers with Drop-in liners. They're SO much more sanitary, easy to clean, portable, CHEAPER, and prevent gas better than those bottles ever did for my son.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
159886,1,I purchased this gate with the intent to use it to keep parts of my house off limits to my pets. For me it is working great! I love the sliding lock and it's very snug when put in a door frame. I chose not to use the mounting hardware because I could not get it to work with my baseboards. I only wished this gate came in a wider version too!
91812,0,I read previous reviews and I'd have to agree with them. You can't put alot of water in the bathtub or this thing will float right up. The suction cups won't stick to the bathtub in the house we're living in now so here's to hoping it'll work in our new home come Spring. If you want something that stays put I'd keep looking but otherwise if you only use about an inch or two of water like we do then you'll be ok with this one.
50042,2,"This is a good concept. I like how there is a place to attach toys and your keys. It's super easy to put on, too (which isn't always the case with baby carriers.) I gave this item a 2 because the strap is very uncomfortable. I can not comfortably wear this for more than a couple of minutes at a time. The strap gets twisted in the pad and the pad ALWAYS ends up facing away from me. My shoulder/neck is very sore after I'm done with it. I would suggest spending the extra money on a carrier with a thicker shoulder strap. I've bought a dozen cheap carriers and I now know that I would have been better off putting all of my money into just one good carrier or sling."
95585,1,"There is a jumbo toy hammock and a smaller toy hammock by the same maker. I read the reviews and bought the jumbo toy hammock. If you are looking for a hammock that will hold a HUGE amount of stuffed animals up off the bed, this is perfect. This is indeed a jumbo toy hammock.This came with the mounting screws and was very easy to install. It seems to hold up quite well to being piled high with stuffed animals. The sides that go flush with the wall are both a little bit elastic so they stretch and give as you load this hammock up with animals.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
140462,1,"I have been using this swing with my son since he was born, and he is now almost 4 months and this swing has done everything it said it would do. I especially like the plug in feature so you don't have to worry about batteries. It folds up but it is not that compact when folded. I like that the mobile folds up to make taking your baby out easier.The weakness in the swing is the loose wiring; sometimes the swing stops swinging as if it is stuck between gears and other times the music switches themes or stops altogether. Other times the mobile will only stop or start when the music is on, but some fiddling with all the buttons usually resolves these little problems. But this swing puts my baby to sleep when I need it to and keeps him entertained briefly when needed."
167988,1,"These diapers are great especially for the price! I mean no diaper is perfect but these really hold everything in, even at night. I am picky about my diapers and I want them to hold up to the job and these definately do the trick. And here in Texas it gets really hot in the summer so these are a great choice for that hot weather since they tend to be thinner then other brands I have tried in the past. The net inside them helps wick away moisture and poop. Sometimes the poop is barely stuck to my daughter's bottom. All in all the best diaper I have found and the price is great too."
77627,1,"We've had these for over a year now, hanging above my daughter's changing table and I still love them! She loves looking at them (and now trying to take them off the wall)."
118817,1,"I researched boosters for my daughter, starting 6 months before her 3rd birthday. This booster appeared to be the absolute best, both safety wise and, fortunately, price wise. We presented this booster to my daughter on her birthday and we have never looked back.It took about 2 days to convince her that the seat belt wasn't a toy, but after that, no problems have arisen. She can nap in it just as easily as her carseat before and she's learning about seatbelt safety. The cup holders are Wonderful and make her feel just like a big girl.I haven't had to clean it yet, so I'm not sure about that feature, but moving it from car to car (to truck to SUV) is a Breeze! So much easier than our carseat. We've even flown with it recently (the travel bag was so handy and easy to use) and had no problems carrying it in the airport and gate-checking it.I highly recommend this booster to anyone who asks me!"
162239,0,I bought this when my son was a newborn he is now 2 1/2. This isn't the best quality set of drawers & also have a think about whether or not you want a changing table built in to your furniture because once your child is potty trained (about 2-3 years old) you wont need the changing table anymore! I would recommend getting slightly better quality set of drawers without a built in changing area - just put a change mat on top of your drawers that way they can keep the drawers for many years to come.
154763,0,"The wipes are O.K. quality wise, however I've noticed the last ones remaining in the wipe warmer got pretty dry. They are also very SMALL I have to use several wipes to clean messy number 2. I like the fact they are chlorine free, but to be very honest I will go back to Wallmart's Parent's Choice unscented (blue pkg, cloth texture)those are amazing, cost much less and never gave my baby any rash."
147924,1,"It's an improvement over an older model we had for our first child. However, I still think Fisher Price should make it a little stronger. Otherwise it's great, and we just learned to live the clicks. The price was right. My local Sears had it for $19.99!"
13238,1,This product makes it so much easier for me to get the car seat base tight enough in the center back seat. I could never get the lap belt tight enough on my own before. My husband would always have to help so it wouldn't be moving from side to side. And that was problematic because we'd take the base out fairly often because we'd need to fold the seats down to move things with the car. But now with the Mighty Tite I can get the lap belt tight enough on my own. I really like this product.
4434,1,I used these frames as party favors for my sister's baby shower and they were a big hit. The frames are good quality and were shipped quickly.
32020,0,we bought this bed at the store and when we got it home and carefully unpacked it - 3 pieces were broke. Babies R Us wouldn't exchange it we had to call the manufacture to ship us out new pieces which takes 2-5 weeks. It's been 2 weeks and still haven't recieved the new pieces. My only suggestion is when you buy it at the store make them open it and check all the pieces before walking out.
144244,2,We ordered this spout guard as our 11 month old is now taking baths in the bath tub without her infant bath seat. As she moves around we are concerned she might bang her head on the faucet. However this sassy froggie is almost as hard as the faucet. It probably will be safer because there are no sharp edges but we were looking for something much softer. Maybe it was just wrong expectations on our part but we returned this item and will continue to search for something soft. A bang against this will certainly hurt.
24594,0,"This is a good gate - very sturdy, easy to open BUT if you put it in a doorway, the foot pedal may NOT allow you to close the door all the way. My husband works at home and needs the door closed! We are using it to keep our 2 yr old OUT of Daddy's home office and I had to adjust it so the door could close with the gate installed. You can tighten it up so it still is firmly installed, but it is not quite as sturdy when done this way. The rubber stoppers have to be partly off the door frame."
102948,1,I am the mother of a breastfed 3 month old and have had this pail for about a month now. My baby sleeps in our room and so I needed a trashcan for those middle of the night diapers. This diaperpail is sitting right next to my HEAD beside the bed and it contains all of the odors quite well and I ususally put 2-3 poopies in there per day.I gave this 4 stars because the flaps on the inside do not close all the way together when there are several diapers inside. The result is that when I open it to change the bag (usually twice a week) the odors do come out! My only other problem with it is that it is hard to push the button to open the top with a squirmy baby there.
106798,1,"I received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift for my first child (now 6), but it was the original model (i.e., narrow opening), and I had difficulty finding refills. While shopping for a replacement diaper pail for my second child, I was sold on the Diaper Champ. It is so easy and convenient to use, and it requires only one hand to use. No worry about a wobbly pail as you insert and store the diaper thanks to the pail's broad-based bottom (and it will be difficult for my son to topple this one over). Many customers have complained about diaper odor, but I have found using Glad scented kitchen garbage bags nearly eliminates this problem (however, cheaper scented bags don't work as well). The cost of these garbage bags is negligible compared to the cost of Diaper Genie refills."
61956,1,"My sons been potty trained since 18 mos but hes just not developmentally ready to be dry at night. Pampers Easy ups are the BEST. They have no problem holding him through the night. We never have leaks! He calls them his ""diegos"" :)"
54799,0,"We actually have two of these, one for each crib. Our son Alex absolutely loves his, but Anthony hasn't had a chance to enjoy because the mobile quit rotating within a few uses. We also had the problem of the unit falling off - though it never fell on the baby. I was debating whether or not to buy another - because Alex likes it so much, but perhaps I won't after reading other reviews where folks had the same issues. I'd hate to buy another and have the same difficulty!"
127938,2,"I bought this brush because I feel like I'm constantly trying to figure out how to get my breastmilk bottles free of the milky slim (and smell). At first I didn't think it would even fit in my 5-oz Medela breastpump bottles. It fits. Sort of. But each time I used it I banged up my thumb. Finally I jammed the thumb against the bottle so badly that I couldn't sleep and set up holding ice on my finger half the night. That was a month ago and my finger still hasn't fully recovered. I no longer use this bottle brush. But it did work really well on the bottle, which is why it got more than 1 star. I'm back in the market to find something new. Maybe a cleaning solution to soak?"
91524,1,I have this monitor in my 2 year old daughters room ...I love it ...you can turn down the volume and still see the bars moving if your child is crying ....or u can have the volume on and i can hear a pin drop in that room..I dont know why a few people said it was horrible ...i have never gotten an ounce of static out of it and they probably just got a defective one ...i have a 4 month old and someone bought me a safety first monitor and i am gonna return it and use the credit to buy this same monitor ...its hard to find good products and i intend on staying with this one that i trust ...Hope this helps !!
127183,0,"I usually by Huggies Gentle Care for my baby but had to buy a couple of packs of these b/c the store didn't have the Gentle Care in my daughter's size. They work well, but they're just not as, well, gentle as the others. I still prefer them over pampers (they leak every time my baby poops), but I will make sure that we get the Huggies Gentle Care from now on."
116032,0,We just received this moses basket yesterday. The bedding is a bit different than I expected - the sides are actually an embroidered polkadot with the waffle just on the bottom of the insert. Basic mattress pad. I am planning to make my own bedding from an easy tutorial I found online in addition to what we received.We are planning to use this with the Jolly Jumper stand which has not arrived yet!
15502,1,Easy to install and to essamble. We have two of these gates that we use for a large play area for or twins.
184216,1,"These blankets are an absolute life safer. I had two for my daughter who is almost 2 now, and I purchased 2 more for my newborn. These blankets keep the baby from getting their arms out, which is critically for a newborn to keep sleeping. It is also very calming for a newborn to be wrapped up tightly, because it simulates the feeling they had in the uterus. I can't say enough about these blankets. Both of my daughters have slept really well in these blankets."
76747,1,these wash cloths are soft and absorbent. i've been using them for 5 months now and they hold up well. they're easy to hand wash too if you need to do a quick mop of spit up or spills.
178991,0,"We purchased these in the slow nipple variety because our son chokes easily on most other brands. He choked less with these nipples, so I give 5 stars for those. The bottles are made of durable plastic. However, the bottles have some drawbacks. First, the measurement markings wear off the bottles quickly. We don't scrub the outside of the bottles but within 3 days of purchasing these the markings began wearing off and by 1 week were almost completely gone, making it difficult to see how much of the bottle our son had taken. The ink began wearing off when our hands were holding the bottle while we fed our son. One of the many disadvantages of having so many of our products made in China, as most baby bottles are now. The quality standards could be a bit higher. Next, the vent on the bottom of the bottles leaks sometimes. Also, the bottle collar can sometimes come easily loosened while the child is eating and begin to leak. The nipples and decreased colic are the best thing about these bottles. The rest needs a bit of work."
26592,0,"You can't install this anywhere that your foot would need to land. I wanted this at the bottom of the staircase. There is a very high lip on the bottom so your foot would need to step over it, not on it. Gate looked great, nice in black. Just didn't work out for me."
107842,1,"I bought this pump after my second child and I loved it! I had tried a different pump and hated it, so I was skeptical of any pump. This one is so easy to use and comfortable. I recommend this to mothers who work or stay at home. It cleans easy, stores nicely and lasts forever - I've used it for three of my four children."
23866,1,"I love the halo sleepsack. My daughter actually started out as a co-sleeper and was waking every 3.5-4. I realized when she was about 10 weeks old that she would be getting a better nights sleep in her own bed. The next night, my husband and I attempted to get her to sleep in her crib. Every time she would begin to doze off, she would scare herself and her moro reflex would send her arms up into the air. We had tried swaddling her before but without any success. I had received one of these as a gift from the hospital but tucked into a drawer as a gimmicky gift. That night, I drug it out and we strapped her into it. She slept for 8 hours straight that night. She has been sleeping in it every night since then and for most naps, too. She takes two naps a day for about 2 hours each and is sleeping 12 hours a night. I recommend this to all new moms."
106454,1,"When we first thought about a diaper pail, we dreaded it. All we heard about was the Diaper Genie and how great it was until I talked with my sister who turned me on to the 'Champ!' She has a Genie and was told about the Champ. You use your own bags, it's bigger, and it's virtually odor free. The only time that it smells is when we need to change it and then the odor is gone as soon as you take the bag out and put a new one in. No fancy extra bags to buy and no twisting. Fabulous! Yet another product to endorse."
84983,1,"We received this as a gift for my son who was a preemie born 3 months early. Although it was a bit overstimulating for him when he first came home (a month before his due date), he started to really enjoy it when he was about 1 month old and his is now 8 months old and still LOVES it. He loves to reach for the toys, both on his back and for tummy time. He kicks, and the various holes on the sides allow you to put any variety of toys on the gym, even toys that did not come with it. If it can be hung on a ring, we use the toy with this gym to keep it fresh. The song that it plays is so sweet ""Hello Baby"" song and even after many times of hearing it I am not sick of it. I do think that my son is getting to the point that he needs something bigger like a play table or something because he is sitting and standing so much, but I think this gym is one of the best presents we received for sure. HIghly recommended!"
1545,1,The Baby Dry with Flex is the best diaper we have used to date. The FLEX makes it very comfortable for our active son!
98766,1,"I can not say enough good things about this item! It has been a lifesaver for our household. I LOVE the changing area, which has a place for diapers and all the other stuff you need. I am really glad we bought it!"
67496,2,"We bought this a few months ago for our 1 year old daughter. I had an off brand carrier with my son and loved it, so I thought this would be even better. Wrong. My shoulders ache 5 minutes after putting it on. Even my husband, who is strong and has a high pain tolerance, can't wear it for longer than 30 minutes.Because my daughter's feet can reach the bottom of the frame, she tends to stand up and wiggle out of the straps. I hate that I'm constantly having to tell her to sit down. I listed it on Craigslist and I'm going to purchase something different."
38744,1,"I fisrt tryed those big and annoying plastic infant tubs, but my son just seemed so uncomforatable in them. I was beginning to notice that the plastic tub was making him hurt. I tryed another plastic bath tub and it was just a waste of time, my son hated it! So when I got this one out and put it in the kitchen sink to use it worked perfectly. For the first time it seemed like my son was actually enjoying his bath. Now almost 5 months old he is still loveing it, he can splash freely, he laughs, and no longer screams when he gets a bath!! I would highly recommend this tub to anyone. The designer obviously thought about the comfort of the child when developeing this product!!- Rachel*also sorry if any misspelled words i am typeing with one hand. :) the other is holding my son! : )"
63484,1,This is a very good baby exerciser to have at grandma's house for babysitting. He is only 5 months old and can really turn and play with the toys. I recommend this to anyone looking to get something for a child to play in. I cannot use a walker since my floors are all carpet.So this works really well.
140403,1,"Our baby didn't really enjoy this swing until he was about 2 months old, then all of a sudden he loved being put in it. we usually don't even put the mobile down, as it is perfect for him to kind of ""cool down"" after play and it lulls him to sleep. He is a very active baby and can't go to sleep very well on his own so this is perfect for that.We did notice that sometimes it didn't seem to swing very well but if you push down on the back piece that connects the two side bars and make sure they are locked out as far as they can go it will swing, it seems if that white plastic connecting piece is slightly off then the swing won't work right."
89801,0,"These diapers are very economical, but I have found my baby's stomach and chest soak and wet many mornings if he has slept more than 5 hours. I was already excited my 19 wk old was sleeping longer hours, but I constantly had to worry when he cried in the morning because he was hungry or soaked and most of the time he was soaked. Outside of the night sleeps, this diaper was fine, but I had a relative purchase some Huggies while out and those seem to hold up better through the night sleeps and allows me to have some peace when I go to bed."
45449,1,"My brother and sis-in-law loved this, got it for my step-daughter. We love it. It came to our house one weekend and hasn't left. Add the chimes to this play mat and your baby will play him/herself to sleep. I suggest this for all parents to be. Great shower gift!!!"
81841,2,"if you're serious about breast feeding, and you plan on doing it for at least 3 months, just break down and buy the most expensive professional one. it's very simple. you get what you pay for."
19418,0,This is not meant for a car seat at all. it pushes the tots head forward way too far for it to be safe.I did however use it in my son's stroller and it worked fantastic! it was my favorite go to piece. in addition I would lay it out flat on the ground and it made a great mat for him to lay on.
103438,2,"I installed two gates in my home. After a little over one year both locking mechanisms broke (with 3 days of each other). The gates must be replaced.The instruction manual said ""if you are not satisfied for any reason, call us..."" I explained the product failures to RC2 brand and the response was simple: ""Thanks for your inquiry. The mechanism is not a replacement part. Unfortunately, you will have to purchase a new gate.Thanks, Theresa""The gates were great when they worked. I expected these to last at least 2-3 years, oh well. I will replace both gates with another brand."
116734,1,This is a great Baby Monitor. We tried several baby monitors and this is the only one that didn't interfere with the phones. The problem is that there is too much range with cordless devices nowadays. No one needs a 5.8ghz monitor or cordless phone. You aren't trying to walk down the street a quarter mile. You are wanting to hear your baby in time of need inside your home. This is a basic yet very reliable baby monitor. Buy it and won't have to be returning monitor after monitor like we did initially.
50393,1,"The pillow is a must have for preggy ladies, but the guys will love it also. DH won't give it back, so he got one of his own. He has back problems and its been great for him and I have never slept better since I've used it!The only thing I hate is the cover, its impossible to deal with. Also its bluky, but what do you expect? Once you get it in the bed with you and get the covers situated its awesome.I knock it down a star for the cover, there's got to be a better way to put a case on that!"
150613,2,"I am not thrilled with this jogger. Maybe I just got a lemon, but my jogger veers hard left. I have had my husband and his mechanic friends take a look at it, but there is no solution. Also, my jogger came without the shoulder harness strap. It doesn't seem safe to have my wiggling baby in it with only a waist buckle. My biggest issue is the reclining feature. I think this design is seriously flawed. It is hard to describe but to adjust the seat you pull a cord on the back side of the seat. When we went over a bump (during my jog) the cord slipped off, the seat reclined all the way down and my baby girl's head got caught on the cord, basically dangling her head. I was really upset by this. NOT A SAFE DESIGN FEATURE!!"
53543,1,"We bought one of these three years ago for our oldest son and used it all the time! It came in so handy for eating out - restaurant high chairs are filthy and even if you have a cover your baby is left sitting at the end of the table in the way of other people and the waiters have to put all that hot food onto the table right over your baby's head! With this you can put your baby safely and so securely on the inside of the table/booth when eating out. So nice! It is also handy for visiting friend and family who aren't set up for a baby at their house. The chair can easily be taken apart and washed and it's like new every time. We have used ours for both of our children and I can't even begin to tell you how many of these I've ordered as baby gifts for friends. It's my go to gift! Bear in mind that it won't fit on all tables, but for the most part it'll fit on restaurant tables. Our dining table has a 3 inch skirt and this chair works on it and it works on my parents' table that has about a 4 inch skirt underneath. I say buy it, you won't be disappointed! Works more often than not!"
26597,1,"Great gate! We bought three gates in all, and this was one of the easiest to install. You don't have to screw it into the wall if you don't want. It's just by tension. It's been up for about two months, and it's held up great."
108626,1,When my son was just a couple of months old he started getting VERY collicy. There was nothing we could do until a neighbor suggested the Dr. Brown's Baby Bottles. What a life saver. I saw the bottles in adds but never paid too much attention to them until I was at the end of my rope. It was AMAZING how soon it helped. Over night my son was a different baby. When we have another child I am not messing around with any other bottle we are starting off with these awesome bottles.
86900,2,"These 9 oz bottles come with a slow flow nipples which isn't mentioned anywhere on the product description. Usually all bottles over 5 oz come with fast flow and not slow flow nipples. I had to go out and spend more money to buy fast flow nipples to replace the slow ones that came with these bottles. It was too much of a hassle to ship these back, so over all purchasing this product was a waste of time and money."
63803,1,"This stroller fits well into the trunk of my Toyota Corolla. The basket fits tons of stuff. I can stuff a regular size diaper bag, an infant blanket, a Moby wrap, an adult sweatshirt, and a bottle of water into the basket at the same time. There is an adult cupholder with a small compartment that closes. I can not fit my small cell phone into this compartment. The compartment is really small so I usually keep lipstick and a few quarters in there. The cupholders aren't that great. I got a Starbucks Latte once and (although the cup fit into the cupholder) I ended up spilling the whole thing over the back of the stroller with the motion of the stroller and a few small sidewalk bumps. If my husband and I both have drinks one of us will have to carry a drink. Putting it in the child cup holder isn't an option because my 6 month old will grab it. We did buy a Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy for the handlebars and I use this for drinks because it holds them better than the stroller cupholder. The stroller is light and easy to fold up and unfold. I can do it while holding my son on one hip. My husband is 6' tall and this stroller is perfect height for him to push. I am 5'4"" and equally happy pushing the stroller. When the seat is fully reclined, it isn't very easy to get things in and out of the basket without disturbing the sleeping baby. Also, the wheels aren't great at turning in small spaces. I did contact customer service once to order a replacement part (my husband removed, then lost, the child tray -don't ask me how or why) and they were very helpful and friendly. I was pleased with the level of customer service."
45838,2,"This works best as a step stool. As a potty chair it hasn't worked well with my daughter. The cushioned seat keeps coming off the chair whenever she makes the slightest movement (and we all know how much toddlers like to squirm) which has sometimes allowed the mess to get on the floor as well as my daughter. Also, it gets dirty in all the extra nooks (like under the cushion) which requires a lot more work to keep it clean."
121514,0,"I needed a foot operated diaper pale, It is hard to get the top off when changing the bag. I would have liked it to be bigger but for home use and one baby it is a great size. So far it has been great no problems works fine."
148276,0,"This potty seat is a good buy to just throw in the back of your car for travel purposes, which is what we use it for. However, it is VERY small. My son is 2 1/2 and is of average size (height and weight). It's not all that easy for him to get himself on and especially OFF this potty. Again, it's a good price for an on-the-go potty for people who travel in their cars alot & it is very easy to clean. The splash guard also works very well for boys. Be careful with bigger kids when they're getting up though. Make sure you're holding the potty down with one hand. My son has leaped up a few times with the potty still stuck to his bum, which leads to pee all over the floor!"
7054,1,"Our daughter wore nothing but Swaddlers and when the tme came to move up into 3's we moved to the Baby Dry becasue they are a great daiper and were cheaper. We went through one case before we switched to the Cruisers. She became very active right aobut the time she wentt into 3's. She was crawling, sitting up, rolling over...she was mobile to say the least. She kept popping hte tabs in the Baby Dry becasue they didn't move with her. The Cruisers have more stretch to them adn she's never had that problem since.She wasn't in the 3's long before she moved on into 4's and now at 14 1/2 months we're still using Cruisers in a 5 when she's not wearing Pull Ups."
50919,1,"I bought this pillow for my girlfriend in her 5th month of pregnancy. It took her two or three nights to adjust to the pillow; however, she said she noticed an improvement sleeping the very first night. Before she had the pillow she frequently woke up at night to readjust the 4 pillows she used to support her and keep herself comfortable. Now she sleeps all night. I think she will continue to use this product after she has her baby. She absolutly loves her Snoogle!We share a queen size bed and I do not find this product very large. In fact, this pillow seems to keep her more concentrated on her side of the bed. I was worried that the pillow would take up too much space on the bed and crowd me; however this is not true.My girlfriend is now in her 7th month, she has used the pillow every night, and day (for her nap of course!), for over two months and highly recommends this product."
159743,1,"I received this as a gift from a friend who told me that even though it wasn't on my registry, I had to have it. She was right! My son LOVES this--and has since he was about a week old. I'm not sure why people say you can't use it until the baby can control his head better, because we used it right away and had no problems. It is hilarious to watch him kick like a maniac, all the while smiling and giggling. The one minor complaint I have is that it doesn't fold up for traveling. I'd love to take this with us everywhere we go, but it's a little bulky. Aside from that however, this is a perfect toy and a must-have!!"
117137,0,"I love the compartments and the colors of the bag! The camo looks super cool. BUT the material is pretty cheap, i thought it looked like canvas, but it is more of a nylon. Thats my only complaint."
173651,1,"I got this as a shower gift. Mainly because it is great for a boy or a girl, and we didn't know what we were having. I also wanted a cradle swing, I've heard that the cradle swing is better because it swing side-to-side, not back-to-front. Anyway, I also got the bouncer papasan, I love it. Hunter loves it."
145954,1,Our son is 5 1/2 months old and he absolutely loves this jumperoo. He can bounce and play in it for hours ( not that we let him). When you see your baby that happy it's priceless!
75508,1,"I love this dresser, it's beautiful! It looks very expensive, but obviously it's not. We've had tons of compliments on it, we use the top as a changing table and it works so well. It didn't take long to assemble, maybe an hour at the most. I think it's a great value and a beautiful piece of furniture!"
86236,2,"This is my first Amazon review. I felt I had to write this as we recently purchased a Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8"" Screen here on Amazon and we had a very scary experience with the monitor. The handheld video monitor unit was plugged in our daughter's room and fell over during the night. It fell against a stuffed elephant some of the vents were blocked and the unit totally melted down releasing horrible smelling noxious odors and it scorched the animals synthetic fur.For the record, the manual states that this unit should be well ventilated but I am floored that there is no thermal shutoff and that the unit can get hot enough to completely melt the plastic and burn things around it. Baby items should be designed to be extra safe and in our experience this item is not. When we contacted the manufacturer they just quoted the manual about assuring proper ventilation and offered to sell us a refurbished unit for $80. We will not be using any more Summer Infant products."
55554,2,"This products mechanism is so disappointing and poor. It is basically an electric water heater and when the water boils and lets of steam, the steam warms the milk, whicch is an okay idea, if the quality of the heater was better and it didn't take so long. The heating is uneven and did I mentions takes a very long. Easier to fill a bowl with warm water fronm the tap and put the bottle in it...easier and faster"
23826,1,These blankets are super easy to use - baby seems comfortable & even the sleepiest of parents can do it :). It is very easy to take baby in and out when he is sleepy without disturbing him too much. Love these blankets! Highly suggest parents get them!
134780,1,"I have had this product for about a month now, and quite honestly I haven't used them very much. I used them when I first got them and they worked well. My son is 8 months old and we have Mexican tile floors in our house and my dad has brick floors in his house, and his poor little knees get so red. I used them and he didn't seem to mind them, but he doesn't crawl on his knees anymore. He has figured out that he can get where he wants to go faster by crawling on his hands and feet. He does this even without the knee pads on. So they don't come out of the diaper bag much. He has chubby little legs and they aren't too tight. They don't slide down, and I am hoping to use them more when he learns to ride a bike, maybe. For crawling, I just haven't used them much but they are a good product. I would recommend them for any mom worried about her little one's knees."
15160,2,"#1. I found it quite disturbing that I had to push a dirty diaper with my hand through into the pail. Try doing this while your other hand is on your baby who is squirming. If it is a runny poo-poo diaper you will get it on your hand as you try to squeeze it into the pail. All I have to say is ...yucko!#2. You have to buy special bags. I recommend buying one where you can just use plain kitchen trash bags. Save your money!#3. Odor control...I think not. You have bend down over the pail while you are pushing a yucko diaper in with your hand, so you get a whiff of brewing diapers every time. On a positive note it did seem to be ok smelling while it was just sitting there. But this may be because I changed it often and diapers weren't really sitting around in it for longer than a day.#4. I knocked the thing over more than not when trying to put in a diaper. It is not very sturdy because the base is quite skinny. Especially if you have it sitting on carpet and it is empty. I found putting a diaper in this thing was really a two handed job. Not exactly easy to do when your baby is laying up on a table and is feeling squirmy.#5. Doesn't hold a lot of diapers. I found myself emptying it quite often. This waists bags because each time you empty it, you have to pull the bag down a bit to cut it off. Then tie a knot in to make the bottom of the next bag.I'm currently using the hands free diaper pail by graco which, although has some issues of it's own, is actually a much nicer pail."
47368,2,I am very annoyed that this Baby Jogger stroller bar doesnt fit the said Baby Jogger City Series stroller model.
25751,2,"I usually do my research before buying new products. But, didn't do as much when looking for a sippy cup. I thought this one would be better when compared to the others. I did speak with one parent and she told me it was okay, but showed me a defect with another well known brand. Well, I'm not pleased. The spout leaks and collapeses and is a bit too large for my son's mouth. I've tried loosening it a bit, but that doesn't help. I only use it when absolutely necessary. Will definitely not recommend this one..."
142238,1,"This carrier is such a godsend!I had a carrier by Infantino, which I used when my son was a newborn. It worked great for that time period, but after he reached about 14 lbs., it became too painful to use.My son is 7.5 months old and about 18 or 19 lbs. and the Baby Bjorn carrier is very comfortable for me to use. I find that I had to play around to get it to the right settings, but once I found out how I liked to wear it, I just leave all the straps adjusted for my use and it's a breeze to put on. I feel as though he is very securely strapped in and supported.My son still likes to face me, and he is very content to cuddle up and look around. He does not like for me to sit while I am wearing it, as his little feet are constantly trying to push him to a standing position and that does not work out too well. But as long as we are standing or walking, this works great.I am somewhat petite (5'3) and my son is tall (maybe 27 inches?) so I really can't wear him front-facing too well, as he hangs down too low and his limbs flop all over when he's excited, basically making me look like a human tourist attraction. (""LOOK AT ME!!! SHORT LADY WEARING A BABY!"") I could wear him front facing, but too many people give me weird looks.If you are SUPER PETITE, i'd suggest trying this out before you buy it. I have my straps pretty much fastened to the tightest settings, where they cannot go any smaller. So if you're like a size 00, you may want to see if this works for you before you spend the $."
93447,2,"We purchased this when my daughter was a little over a year. We thought it was so cute. Around 18 months we started working with her. She saw this as more of a toy than anything else. She continually wanted to make the music go off, so she would put toys in it or stand in it. It defeated the purpose...she wanted to play rather than potty. We ended up taking the batteries out and put it away for a while. We bought another chair to use...but we still use this one (as we have 4 bathrooms). She is now well-potty trained and does everything on her own. My other major complaint is how hard it is for her to empty the chair. WHen she tries to pull out the dish, it tends to spill b/c the dish is so well connected. Our other potty chairs are SO much easier for her to empty AND put back!!! This one, she can't get it back on the ""hooks"" underneath. So, needless to say, I wouldn't buy this again!!!"
25320,1,Even though my baby doesn't use it (he won't sleep anywhere for longer than 20 min except on me) I gave it 5 stars because it would really work great if he would just get on board with it.It was easy to put together and perfect for the space we use it in. I wish I would have purchased this in the very beginning instead of at 3 months.
178293,1,"This is a great bag and it's size is deceptive (in a good way). I had a couple other diaper bags and I finally found the right one. One was way too large... I ended up donating that one to my mom so she'd have a diaper bag for when she's babysitting. Another was just a big abyss with no pockets at all.This one is perfect. I put three nine-ounce bottles, a three serving formula dispenser, baby food and a spoon, two burp cloths and two bibs, a few small toys, the included changing pad and my wallet in the main compartment. I put five size four diapers and a small tube of rash cream in one of the front pockets, a wipes case in the center front pocket (it's the widest) and more of my stuff in the other front pocket (cell phone, chapstick, hair ties, etc). I keep an extra outfit and, now that it's cooling off, a receiving blanket for my son in the back pocket (there are two pockets in the back of the bag, on the outside).The cell phone holder is essentially useless you have a small flip phone or bar phone... and even that might be cutting it. But, it's easy to remove since it's just held on with velcro.There is a bottle pocket, but I haven't used it yet.I really like the attached stroller clips. The too-large diaper bag that I had came with clips, but they weren't attached to the bag (you had to either leave them on the stroller and hope they didn't get lost or keep them in the bag) and they were thin rubber (which ripped through after three uses). I really like how these are attached to the bag... nothing to lose or store.The fabric of the bag is really heavy canvas and the zippers are heavy duty. They're not the cutesy (and flimsy) zippers that most bags have.I think my favorite part is the messenger style of the bag. I hate going into public bathrooms, only to find that there is nowhere to put the diaper bag. The hooks on the changing stations all seem to be long gone and only a few select stores/restaurants have thought to install a shelf or a hook on the wall. So you end up having to put your diaper bag on the floor. Ew. This bag can stay attached to the parent while you're changing diapers.So, to sum it all up. Great bag, lots of space. I can't imagine needing to take anything else for one child. I think I over-pack and there is still have plenty of space. The only negative I can come up with is the tiny cell phone holder and that's not enough for me to drop a star."
172187,1,"I love this seat! When I brought my 6 lb. baby boy home from the hospital he was able to fit into the cradle right away. He grew out of that in about 5 weeks and now he is sitting on the infant side of the tub. This tub fits perfectly into my single sink, but baby LOVES to splash so I've been putting it in my tub.The only downside to this is that my son is only 3 1/2 mos. old, 25 in., 15 lbs and barely fits in here anymore. I dont see him using this thing for more than 2 more mos...at which point I will have to move to a bigger seat I guess.Overall great seat, great price!"
179518,1,"When I see people at the airport struggling with a carseat flung over their shoulder or in the stroller, I feel like running over and telling them to get a Go-Go Kidz. My daughter loves being in it, it's just like a stroller and it moves easily.It did take me a bit of time to get used to the screwing and unscrewing, but I've figured out that you DON'T have to take it apart to get it through the scanners - they'll hand scan it for you or you just flip it over so the carseat is face-down and it'll go through the bigger scanners. People say it takes a long time to unscrew, but it's not a big deal once you've done it a few times. And I'd rather have a secure set-up than a quick-release option (and I guess a quick release would also make it less adaptable to different brands?).I haven't seen anything as good as the Go-Go and it really is one of the best most useful baby products I've ever bought. And I'll be using it for several more years!"
94050,1,"This is usually out of stock in stores. Great for traveling, nice compact, doesn't spill. Can be a little hard sometimes taking the lid off. So far the best out there."
141970,0,"These rail covers are definitely extra wide, but I purchased these because the measurements were perfect if I cut it to fit all 3 rails of our crib. The size worked perfectly for us, and you can use double-sided tape to secure to the crib. I would assume that most kids will just start to peel it off, but I also have cloth crib covers over the top to keep the crib looking nice, which also deters my son from peeling the rubber off since he can't really see it.One little complaint is that these are not light weight, which makes them harder to attach and keep on securely - they would be much better with a lighter more flexible material. Also, I have heard that the adhesive can take off crib paint (and the instructions even warn about this) - but we have another baby on the way so I don't intend on taking them off and our crib is now already chewed up (which is why we bought these) - so needs to be touched up with paint anyway. My rail covers never actually came with the adhesive anyway so I can't really comment! I guess that was just a manaufacturer packaging issue, and seeing as though I cut the pieces to fit my crib I would have had to use the double-sided tape anyway to secure it in the right places.Overall, OK product but not perfect."
80890,1,"My 7mth old daughter and I both LOVE this cover! The pillows are a great asset for babies just learning to sit up and are even more valuable since you can remove them once they're not needed anymore. I love being able to clip the cover to the diaper bag and installation in the carts is VERY quick and easy. So far I've used them at Target (it didn't reach to the actual handle bar but covered the metal frame of the cart that was in reach of the kid and the cover didn't quite lay perfectly even over the back rest but it still worked beautifully), Sam's (fit perfectly), Babies-R-Us (it was a little snug on the front bar but still worked) and Kroger (perfect fit). I would highly recommend this product!"
131685,0,"The fit on the seat isn't intuitive, but other reviewers who described how to seat the front lip in front of the potty were very helpful.My son is 30 lbs., and the seat does bow in a little from his weight, but doesn't collapse entirely. For a boy, one should keep repeating, ""Point it down, point it down,"" because there is no splash guard for absent minded boy toddlers.I can see how a little tush might get pinched if the seat were not completely unfolded before he sat down, so it's important to make sure it's completely flat.The design of going over the front of the seat makes sense now, as it minimizes contact between those curious little hands and a dirty public toilet seat. I keep Lysol wipes in my pouch to clean the bottom side of the seat before folding it up and storing it again.It fits easily into a small diaper bag or a large purse. It's definitely something I want on hand on trips to friends' houses or public places.I wish it were a little sturdier and there were a good way to avoid the possibility of pinching, but I will say my 2 year old is particularly squirmy, and he hasn't fallen in or yelped in pain yet.The bottom line is, it is functional, although not perfect, and I would buy it again if I needed to replace it."
92451,1,The cradle mattress fit my little wooden cradle perfectly! It sits on springs and provides padded comfort. Very happy with the item and shipping of it.
66402,1,"Beautiful and not too frilly compared to so many others out there. Fits a very old bassinet from the 50's though it was a bit long and I had to hem it a bit. No complaints, too long is better than too short!"
136526,1,We received this product in a timely manner. Husband put it together rather quickly. Only issue would be that the top drawer on a rare occasion doesn't close properly but it's not a big deal at all. It's very spacious and has a wonderful look. I would recommend this to anyone who has a baby already or one coming.Feb 2013 update: The piece is very easily scratched. We had to move it up an inch and the piece just about fell apart. I am now searching for something more sturdy as I am afraid that even with a wall mount it may decide to fall apart.
48346,0,"Works well except when it is disconnected from the wall plug the video stays on only 3 minutes then goes blank and you have to tap the button on top to turn it back on.There was nothing in the instructions about this, and it didn't show or even address the button on top. I discovered it and its use accidentally when the screen went blank when I tried to carry it with me and I started pushing and things to get a response.Instructions say not to leave it plugged in all the time as it wears down the battery. However, when I wrote to the company to complain about it turning off, I was sent an email telling me that it goes off to save the battery!Doesn't really work well for us, as my father wanted to take the monitor with him in his walker around their apartment (my 102 year old mother has alzheimer's and she has to be watched at all times). They want to conyinue to live in their apartment but only have help twice a day during mealtimes, so he is responsible the rest of the day and night.Having to punch the top every 3 minutes is a real hassle for him if he is doing a task or wants to set it on the counter when he takes it to the kitchen or bathroom (he is 99 and on continuous oxygen).The picture is OK and the size of the screen is OK. The camera slides easily when touched which takes the view off my mother's bed, and there is no way to secure it, so we used scotch tape to fasten it to the top of the dresser.For $175.00 it is not worth the money because of these problems. I expected something with better features and especially better instructions."
79368,1,"This jogger is great! I love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it - no complaints, in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w/ mom.I feel like this product is a much better value than the BOB jog strollers - those are overpriced and ultimately this product gives you everything you need."
38152,1,THIS IS THE BEST...JUST POP IN THE FREEZER AND ITS READY...KEEPS BOTTLES COLD ALL DAY....BETTER THAN USING FREEZER PACKS AND THERMAL BAGS...THE OLD FREEZER PAKS TAKES UP TOO MUCH ROOM...THIS IS SOOO MUCH BETTER...
32360,2,"if you have an antique-style wooden toilet seat, this is not the lock for you. It didn't fit our seat and lid."
136300,2,"i received this as a gift for my 4 1/2 month old who can hold up his head pretty well and is attempting to pull himself up, but not yet sitting unassisted. we put him in this exersaucer and he immediately fell forward and hit his face on the edge of the padded seat. i read in consumer reports that babies should not be left in this exersaucer for more than 5-10 minutes at a time because it can cause their back to compress and grow crooked. also, babies should really be more like 8 months old before put being put in it. the box says 4 months and up but the directions (in an inconspicuous place) say baby must be able to sit up on his own."
92646,2,"These sliding door locks are great in theory, but terrible in practice. The adhesive they come with isn't nearly strong enough to keep them on when a child is trying to open the door- They just pop right off. When this happened, I tried to use hot glue gun to make them stay, but the same thing happened. Glue can't hold these door locks on when they're being pushed on from the side like that.I ended up throwing away the door locks and just sticking a screwdrivier in the door to stop it. It's working like a charm. Save your money. Don't buy these."
42180,1,"This is the perfect laundry basket for any nursery! It is a little big, but ended up being the perfect size for us. Think about it, within no time your baby's clothes will be so much bigger so might as well get a bigger basket to begin with. I love the idea of the pull-out mesh bag which makes laundry time so much easier. Before I got this, I would separate the laundry before washing and the baby's clothes would always be in a separate pile-now it's automatically separated; just pull out the bag when it's time for a load and dump it in. It's also great that it's mesh so that it keeps airflow going through and doesn't promote mold growth. And such a great price as well!"
21582,1,"Being somewhat shell-shocked, overwhelmed new parents, we tried nearly every gadget and gizmo out there, searching in vain for something that our daughter would enjoy and feel comfortable in for more than a few minutes. Swings, rockers, bouncy chairs... you name it, we tried it.Tried this one in a last-ditch effort and were astonished when she first got excited (gurgling and cooing), then eventually fell asleep comfortably in it. Could it be? Could we have finally found THE chair? Yep; we did.Since then, the chair has been used on a daily basis. She loves it as much now as she did the day we bought it.My only concern is that it does not have an adaptor, so you have to use batteries. You will want to buy rechargeable batteries, since you'll go through them quickly with this product."
17872,1,"We love this mobile! This is the nicest mobile I have ever owned/seen. My son loves to stare at it, and it even helps him to fall back to sleep. I wish I had this mobile 4 years ago when my daughter was born!"
73781,1,My wife and I have used this from day one and it has become an integral part of being able to set a routine for our daughter. It really takes some of the guess work out of raising a newborn. Highly recommend.
45398,1,Echo what everyone said that was positive -- very fun! Soooo many different ways our lil one uses this that it can entertain for quite awhile. We started her on it right away and still at 7 months she's crawling through it (months 2-6 were peak). The hanging toys are really neat and like everyone has said you can take them along for more fun elsewhere. Folds flat under our couch when not in use easily and have had no problems cleaning up baby puke with a wipe.
126010,1,"I purchased these diapers out of a need, not for myself, but for my chuncky-fat offspring. It should be noted, he could care less what he wets or soils himself in, but for my wife and I, we've had plenty of past experiences with our other two children where getting cheaper, store-brand diapers ended up not able to hold much at all. That led to a lot of stain control and extra laundry sessions. Huggies seems to work well at keeping the poop in. (The diaper, that is; this product, as far as I'm aware does not cause baby constipation.) Now if only they made some sort of device for catching all the spit-up and puke...***PRO TIP: Open the diaper, place the child between the folds, and use the sticky strips on the sides to secure the back of the diaper to the front of the diaper, one around each leg. You'll find this application works best in most, if not all, cases. (Should seem obvious, but, then again, you're the one reading a review on diapers.)"
79081,1,I don't like that you can't pick your colors. I will not give my boy a pink pacifier.
158847,1,"Got this as a baby shower gift. My baby is 3 months and started using this at 2 weeks. No problems with air getting in the nipple. Yes, this has 2 extra parts than normal bottles but they are ok to clean. I have the Dr. Brown's steam sterilizer which works well to thoroughly sanitize the parts. Overall, great product!"
20228,0,"We bought these bottles for our infant daughter also hoping that it will help prevent spit ups. She didn't like it as it was difficult to suck on.And don't even try using other brands of nipples with these bottles as they won't work. Here's why. Most bottles that have only one open end have 2 holes on the nipples, 1 at the tip and 1 on the base of the nipple for drawing air into the bottle. (And I'd thought it was air from my baby while sucking). These Playtex ones have only 1 hole for letting milk out at the tip of the nipple and at the bottom of the bottle is where dozens of holes are to draw air to compensate the vacuum inside the bottle.My 18 month old is now using these as she hated them months ago.My biggest complain is cleaning them. I have one of those special clean tools that's a brush with a sponge at the end. The design of the bottle at the area where you screw the caps is especially hard to clean without something small like a toothbrush as residue traps inside the bottle at this area.Overall, aside from cleaning it it's a great product."
173091,1,"We brought this to the Toronto Police both times for our Graco Snugride 35 (infant carseat) and our Diono (used to be Sunshine Kids) big kid seat. We had both of them installed with these seatsavers into a Nissan Altima and a Nissan Rogue SUV as we had two of each car seat. All seatsavers took some time to properly secure as we have leather in both vehicles, but it was well worth it. Kept our vehicles clean too. They are extremely snug and if the Toronto Police approve, that's good enough for me"
99781,1,Great product for a great price. I buy all my diapers through Amazon Mom. They have the best price ever. If your not an Amazon Mom then you need to be!!!
128476,1,These bottles do the job. They're also durable and I don't have to worry about all the BPA scary stuff that I am reading all about. They're also an excellent price. I would definitely buy more.
129794,1,"This bed is well made and easy to put together. My son loves it. The guard rails are perfect b/c they don't interfere with him getting in and out of the bed, but don't allow him to fall out either."
45917,1,"When I received the Stim-mobile, I couldn't believe I paid 20 bucks for something that looked like a 3rd grader's art project. Boy, was I wrong! My husband jerry-rigged the mobile to attach on our daughter's bassinet. She's a fussy baby, so the longest stretch of time she has been quiet while lying awake was about 20 minutes. The first time we used the stim-mobile, our daughter was entralled with it, staring and ""talking"" to the images for a full hour. We were amazed. It's a cheap looking piece of plastic that doesn't move or play music, yet it keeps our daughter entertained and HAPPY! I was at my wits end on some days since I couldn't put her down for more than a few minutes. The stim-mobile has helped me regain my sanity since I can leave her in her bassinet without her breaking out into hysterics. I will definitely be buying this as baby shower gifts!"
5627,2,"This item is a great IDEA. Key word, 'IDEA'.PROS:- It's a 4-in-1: elbow rest, knee rest, storage pocket for wash/shampoos, and then later can be used as a stepping stool.- Cute little ice animal theme, polar bears, penguins, whales, etc.- The elbow rest has suction cups that attach to the tubside.- The little storage pockets that hang on the side are helpful for all those crazy bath toys and products babies come with.CONS:- What I did not consider before purchasing this item was the placement of my bathtub's faucet and the toilet. We have two bathrooms, and both bathtubs, on the side where the faucet is the toilet is directly next to it. Generally, if one were to be giving their child a bath, they would be right by the faucet so that they could control the water flow/temperature.... With toilets directly next to my bathtubs, I can't exactly kneel with 3 inches between the two porcelain objects. Hah. I sit uncomfortably on the closed toilet instead and lean over the whole time, which SUCKS.- The stool does not raise up to be any higher than what the picture shows. It is a very VERY short stepping stool, and will be useless for quite a while.- The suction cups for the elbow rest POP OFF almost every time you lean on it, which defeats the purpose. They were very hard to get to stay put in the first place before anyone ever leaned on it.- Also, the top of the elbow rest CRACKED after maybe the 2nd time we used it.Conclusion:I LOOOVED the idea of this product. Still haven't seen a similar product, but I was very disappointed with the quality and exact features of this, and I was frustrated with myself for not considering that I couldn't even use this feature because of my bathroom set-ups. This will be up for sale at my next garage sale."

35113,2,"I only gave this car seat 1 star because I really don't like it, the only thing I do like is the print, it is classy, but everything else is terrible. The car seat itself weighs about a hundred pounds, it is very uncomforatible to carry, the canopy thing never stays up and worst of all the straps keep coming undone, I believe this carseat should get rechecked by those safety people because those straps coming undone all the time is very dangerous. If I could I would like my money back and as of today I am searching for a new car seat."

33069,0,"Every mom who's breastfeeding has probably felt the uncomfortable - or downright painful - sensation of clothes rubbing on or sticking to sore nipples. These shields alleviate that problem beautifully. They are also inconspicuous under clothing, although if your cup size is on the larger side that might not be the case. However, the one major problem I have with these is the fact that they collect all the milk that may leak out. They hold it in just fine, up to a point. When the (tiny, nearly useless) absorbent sponges that are included to insert in the shells are saturated and the shell fills up, just leaning forward or jostling the shell releases a splash of milk down the front of your clothes. Not pleasant! My solution has been to wad up toilet paper or paper towels to replace the sponges, and to check frequently that the shells aren't filling up on me. In short, they do work well for their intended purpose, you just have to be prepared for the inherent problems of putting a milk-collecting cup over your nipple."
33854,2,"I have seen this product( and others similar to it) . As an RN,we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the ""cuteness"" of items that are geared only to be sold, not to be useful. Although each category of item in this kit is certainly useful,and some essential, it is far better to spend your money on the items purchased separately. In this way, you can check for quality and longevity. Put together your own kit."
121680,1,"The Boppy is a must-have for new babies! I've been using it every day for nursing, and my husband and children use it every time they hold the baby. Makes it much easier on the arms, and it's nice and comfy & supportive for baby. I couldn't find a Boppy print that I liked anywhere in town, but Amazon had a nice selection to choose from, and I found exactly what I was looking for. Plus, as usual, it arrived a few days before the expected arrival date. Amazon is my go-to shopping place for anything I can't easily find at a store in town."
3273,1,"All of the Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe blankets we own have been easy to use & wash/dry. Much easier, faster and cooler for baby than swaddling in a regular flat/square swaddle blanket. My son is 15lbs & 24"" long, so wears the Large Size. I just wish there were more patterns to choose from. Kiddopotamus also sells a swaddle blanket made out of bamboo material - super soft & breathable! Unfortunately that only comes in small."
48255,2,"It's never been dropped or abused and yet similar to another reviewer, our monitor is losing the sound more and more. It goes in and out when the volume knob is turned. We have only had this a year and paid $176 for it. WAY too high priced for this kind of thing to happen. I would expect this from a $50 monitor not one that costs nearly two hundred."
16837,2,"Bought two of these as our daughters bed comes out from the wall not against it. Forget using two as the way the rails are you can not put two of these on a bed. The rails below are very bulky and angle the bed/put large lumps. The idea of the rails being hidden is great however if your kids bed sits in any frame that covers even the tiniest part of the mattress forget this function. Incredibly disappointed, it gets two stars as it is made in a bombproof manner but that is the only reason it even gets 2 stars."
53619,1,"I bought this strictly for travel, although we could easily used it as our every day high chair. While it doesn't work on every table, I definitely feel it was a worthwhile investment. We have the Stokkes Trip Trapp chair for everyday, so our daughter was used to sitting at the table. When it is secured, I feel it is very safe, but whenever I am in doubt, I simply slide another chair under her. I give the price a big thumbs up!"
75844,2,"Wow, what a disappointment. Where do I start? The numerous sharp edges from the sloppy moulding of the plastic parts? the front wheels that don't swivel well, leaving them to chatter sideways when I'm walking forward? the ""safety bar"" that pops off easily? Well, at least it didn't cost much. My wife bought this to take on a trip because it's lighter and smaller than our graco stroller. OK, there's 2 good things- It's kinda light and kinda small. Still, I'd rather carry my kid than use this annoying thing. You are much better off buying a good stroller or a moby wrap."
170404,1,"This is a great car seat. I have one other and a Bodyguard booster seat. They are expensive, but so is my cargo in my opinion.Equipped with the LATCH system which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children. This Anchor system is wounderful feature, it makes installation so much easier, especially if you ever have to switch the seat into another car that is also equiped with the anchor points. Some vehicles don't have the anchor points which would require the standard seatbelt installation.These anchore are 2 locking devices, one on each side of the car seat which clip install into metal loops which are factory installed on some vehicles inbetween where the back of the seat and the bottom of the seat meet. You can feel them or see them if you dig or spread the cushion. Check your service manual for the location.You simply push the achors and snap them into position. Then just kneel on the car seat and pull the tethers tight. removing is a simple push of a button.The Versa-Tether, which keeps the seat from tilting forward or backward is a nice additional safety feature. Again, with vehicles built with the tether anchors installed. You don't need to use the anchors but if you can it helps anchor the seat.The seats are rather large, make sure they fit before you just buy one. You can do that by testing one with a local retailer. I've found that getting a comfortable reclining angle while rear facing to be harder. It's easier forward facing, but those are based on my own vehicles, that can vary so again, you should try before you buy.I'm overall very happy."
40865,1,"No doubt Pampers are the best, but ordering via Amazon Subscription is the best. Great price and you don't have to shop for diapers or run out. They show up at your door. What could be better."
83869,1,"This placemat is bigger than I anticipated, and doesn't roll up quite as small, but the coverage area is nice and it generally sticks well to the tables. Our daughter is able to pull it off though, so we have to keep an eye and or a hand on it."
175424,1,"We use both cloth diapers and disposables. These covers are fab. I actually got more leaks with the Costco/Kirkland brand diapers, actually we never had any leaks with the Bummis diaper cover at all. My only complaint is that they were a little bulky. My little boy looked like he had a humongous tush wearing these, but since these were the only covers I tried, I have nothing to compare them to. They were pretty easy to keep clean. I only bought 2 just to try them and would rinse off with soap and water and it would be dry by the next time I changed him. Basically you don't need too many."
46241,1,"So far this item seems to hold up very well even when my 8 month old grabs and shakes the panels. The only complaint I have is some of the panels had small plastic strings stuck to them, likely from the molding process at the manufacturer. My daughter has pulled them off but we have been lucky to catch her before the strings go in her mouth."
45171,1,"My son has been using this playmat since he was a few days old. It doesn't come with a tummy time pillow, so that's my only regret, but its got so many other fun things to keep him entertained that its not a big deal. Plus, he has to try a bit harder to lift up without the pillow, so it may be better than having one anyway. He loved playing with the toucan and the elephant starting as early as 3 weeks old."
154842,1,This feeder help cut down the mess outside my cage by 95%.Now the mess stays in the cage and lands on the tray.My Budgies eat comfortably on the built in perch.Easy to fill and refill.Worth the few bucks it costs.
139475,1,My grandchild loves this night light. She is 4. Has been using it since Christmas and turns it on each night to look at the stars.
42099,2,"This cup is awful. I bought it at a local store because I thought it was the Super-spout cup (which I like a lot), but this cup is terrible. The entire top and spout collapse when my son drinks out of it because the small vent holes do not work, and the cup leaks because it is hard to align the removable soft silicone spout part with the screw-on top/handle piece. If I could return these cups I would - they are the worst. The best thing I can say for them is that they are easy to clean."
175740,1,With my first child her swaddling always came undone when she was carried or being passed around to friends and family. Later she kicked off her blankets when in her crib. My 2nd daughter is currently 4 months old. I got lots of use out of it when she was a newborn for swaddling and have brought it out again now that she has started rolling over and kicking her blankets off. It was really the onlt blanket I used to cover/wrap her. She is average length and it still fits her but is getting small at the armholes. I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice if it were slightly larger so it could be used longer. I will definitely purchase the next size.I have read the other review that mentioned the swaddler wrap getting bunched up around the neck and face. This never happened when we used it and I can't imagine how it happened to them. I always wrapped my daughters arms accross her chest because she liked to suck her fingers. Perhaps wrapping the arms down too far caused this?
173500,1,"I bought this swing after a particularly trying day with my 5 week old, willing to try anything that may give me a moments rest. The swing has turned out to be great. While not a 'magic pill' for fussiness, the swing keeps my now 2 month old entertained and often lulls him to sleep. He loves the sounds and the motion around the mirror and we like that is swings side to side as well as front to back. I wish it plugged into the wall so we could save on batteries, but other than that....this is a great swing."
130541,1,"My daughter loved this swing from day one! She loved the fact that the swing goes the non-traditional way. When she got her 1st cold it was the only thing she would sleep in beside my arms. She slept through the night in it while sick! :-) (we moved it into our room). My dad (grandpa)loved how much she loved it that he got one for their house for when she was there for daycare. My daughter only give it up because she got ""too big"" meaning she wanted to sit up all the time!! I won't give this swing up until we are done having babies!"
48540,2,"I purchased this monitor some time ago and it worked fine (though it buzzed all the time...we just got used to it).However, after reading other reviews mentioning security issues with the monitor channels showing other neighboring babies, I thought I would check my other channel. Needless to say, I was horrified to see our neighbors little boy sleeping soundly on the other channel! After calling Summer Infant, they confirmed that if I can see them, they can see us too! We have the monitor set up to see our daughter's entire room and it runs 24/7, so when we go to tuck her in at night (in our pajamas), or anything else throughout the day, our neighbors have been able to see and hear everything! Summer realizes this is a ""problem"", so they offered to replace my monitor with the Secure baby monitor at no cost.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT as anyone with the same monitor can also see yours."
157222,1,"Although expensive, it is a great product. I have been exclusively pumping for 4 months now, pumping about 48 ounces a day, which I could not achieve with a Dr. Browns manual pump. I pump 5 times a day for aprox. 20 minutes. The pump and accessories are easy to clean and use."
128848,1,"Just what I needed. Shipped fast. Very satisfied with the product, Right now moving towards sippy cups, good luck with that"
70726,1,This is a good size rocker. I bought it for a 4-month-old baby and it's perfect. Assembling it was quick. Instructions were fool proof. Baby especially loves the musical thingie in the middle. Only problem is that it only plays music for about 1-2 minutes then you have to pull on it again for the music to play and there is a Velcro on the back to fasten the fabric together that doesn't hold up well.
151780,0,"Beautiful, fade-resistant colors ...I bought two of these - one in Navy and one in Red. They are very soft to the touch (and stayed that way even after a few washes), but they are SO thin. I was really shocked.I actually had a well-worn Simmons changing pad cover that was very plush (I was buying these to replace it), and I ended up keeping it to use UNDER these. I have a hard time complaining about such a low price, but a person should really know what they are getting.So, if you buy one and don't want to be stunned by what comes out of the package - keep these things in mind:1. They are THIN ...2. Very stretchy/gauzy3. Stitching isn't anything amazing4. They do wash nicely5. Liquids pool on the top (if you have a toileting accident, it buys you time before it soaks through)6. Each one has crescent moon-shaped slots for the changing table pad's safety straps"
141420,0,"This toy does it's job - it walks well on our hardwood floors, but my daughter has to really push it if we are outside in the yard on short grass. The ONLY issue I have with this toy is that there are two settings for volume, low and high, and the low is way too loud. I tried to put tape over it, but of course that's just another thing for my daughter to try to play with since the speaker is on the front panel. If anyone who has this toy has figured out a way to lower the volume, please let me know!"
75320,2,Product did not work so now I am out of $121.00 not too happy with the out come. So how I am out the gift card totally and a breast pump.
50105,1,"Such a nice little bed! Very durable; so far, it has lasted for two of our kids! My only complaint is that the sliding drawer only opens one way. I wish we could have put it on the other side of the bed because of where we had it in her room, we did not get to use the drawer. We also painted it to match our second childs room better, still looks great! All of the boards have made it through all of the jumping!"
102629,0,"Our twins have two different mobiles to keep things interesting. While they enjoy watching this one move, they soon lose interest. I think it's because you can barely hear the music. Another problem is that the remote clicking is so loud that it defeats the purpose. What I do like are the cute and colorful animals and the nice movements. It's pretty good product, but I wouldn't buy it again unless they turn up the volume quite a bit. Overall - attractive, but disappointing."
162798,0,these are cute .. great but of course you could live with out more fun just to look at them .. function pretty well ..i only wish we did not have to take a chance on colors i bought these for my son and prayed that the boy colors would come in ..
156615,1,"this is my second baby and just like the first one, this one loves to swing. i have a full size swing downstairs and keep this one upstairs. my son falls asleep almost instantly when put in it. If not he is happy looking in the mirrow or at the flower. he grabs onto the link a doos. Unlike the other mom's i find the seat to be quite large. My son isn't a small baby,and he is almost 4 months old and fits just fine in it. I love the open top, i have antoher take a long swing with the bar across the top and prefer this one. i would recommend this swing to anyone looking for a portable take along."
72886,0,I like this chair but it's a little small. The tray is very small. Can't even put a childs plate on it.
51411,1,"I have been very pleased with these diapers! The ajustable snaps are great! I don't know how they would do with a newborn size booty, but for my 1 year old they are great! I do still use disposable diapers, due to the fact that we only have 6 BumGenius diapers and my daughter can go through 6 in one day. I will say, I do get tired of doing the laundry and having reusable diapers adds to the load. But totally worth the extra work!"
11402,0,"The sound quality on this is really nice... TO MY SCANNER! I got this used from a garage sale, and since I wanted to ensure that there is no interference to our other baby monitor. I used my ham radio (which receives signals from 500 kHz to 1 Ghz, and was quickly able to find these on 902 Mhz with channel spacing by about 0.25 Mhz. The signal is plain wide FM which can be picked up on any scanner. The ""private"" signal is not encrypted at all.While I don't think that should stop anyone from purchasing these, don't assume that your neighbors can't pick up the scanner. Buyer beware."
48324,1,This system works perfectly in our home with NO interference at all. If you have a wireless network or wireless phones please don't waste your time on the 2.4 GHz model which will give you severe interference. If you still use 900 MHz phones you may want to check with the Manufacturer though as I'm not sure if those will cause a disturbance with this model. We LOVE this system!!
64196,2,"The box took a long time to arrive. When it arrived, it had black marks on the side and the top had been pushed in. I was very disappointed."
149118,2,"My wife is 8 months pregnant and is having severe back pain. I bought this pillow for her thinking that its wrap around back support would relieve some of her pain. Unfortunately, this pillow didn't ease my wife's pain at all and we returned it after just a few days."
84020,1,He spent a good portion of christmas day climbing in and out of the box and putting his toys in and taking them back out. The hinges hold in whatever position you leave the lid so no smashed fingers and there is no latch do no getting stuck inside. I like it.
43704,1,"We've had the hands free gate for quite a few years now but recently moved into a house with a wider doorway so the gate was not fitting as securely as we'd like. We ordered this & when installed, the gate is very sturdy & now I have no worries that my daughter will fall down the stairs. Highly recommend this product!"
8133,1,"I registered for this basket because I live in a 3-story townhouse and thought that having a ""portable"" bed for my baby would be handy. I was right - and this basket definitely fits the bill.It's a beautiful basket, made of soft woven grass -- it's flexible and soft, not rigid and scratchy like wicker might be. The foam pad in the bottom is about 1-1/2 inches thick and is firm, so no worries about suffocation. And it's perfect for carrying my sleeping son from one floor to another without waking him.The literature that comes with the basket says it's ok to use for children weighing up to 20 pounds; I get the feeling that my little boy will be too long for the basket before he reaches 20 pounds, but that's ok. The important thing for me was to have a way to move him from floor-to-floor while he was nursing every 3 hours. The basket is a little smaller than a standard bassinet; I've been using bassinet sheets on it and just pulling the extra fabric under the pad. Works like a charm.I'd reccommend this to anyone who is considering a bassinet...especially if space is an issue or if you have a multi-floor house!"
53140,0,"I love the plastic placemats from Chick fil a and thought this would be the same. The adhesive is not as strong and even though the adhesive is on all four sides, my 9 month old son can and does pull it up when he gets bored. It does however keep his food off dirty restaurant tables."
59260,1,"My mother uses it during the day to heat milk while i'm at work. It works pretty good, she unplugs it after each use, to make sure that it doesn't stay on."
145563,0,"At first this was the best thing in the world to us. She loved it. It helped us keep her busy if we needed our hands free. It's amazing in that sense. I will say that you have to really consider your babies heath and developement. My daughter now has a neck condition called Torticollis where she leans her head to one side more than the other. I have to say that this toy only made things worse. It is terrible for their little necks. Their head bobbles all over the place and the impact on their joints too. I am not an overbearing mother, just someone trying to tell you that this toy may seem like a good idea at first but may be better for babies when they are a little bigger. Closer to 20 lbs. I would recommend good old fashioned playing. You can simulate that same motion holding your baby without all that wobbling and impact."
81145,1,"I carry two of these in the diaper bag-- one for used prefolds, to go into the diaper service bin when we get home, the other for used cloth wipes, which we launder ourselves. The bags are small enough to fit in my diaper bag, but large enough to hold all the used diapers/wipes from a full-day outing (about 6 infant prefolds).These bags have held up to several runs through the washer and dryer. We've had no leaks, no odors, no problems!"
107559,2,"These are cheap. They don't stick well, and keep sliding. I ended up throwing them away & buying better ones."
160288,1,"I had one of these for my first son, he was a preemie. everyone said, ""ohhhh he's a little preemie, he'll sleep better if he's bundled tight, swadddle this swaddle that..."" he hated the swaddler. then fat and happy full term baby number two comes..... ""oh, big baby's sleep better at night, you won't need to worry about him...."" Horrible sleeper, up all night to eat, but LOVED the swaddler!!! Don't listen to what everyone says. the stereotypes are all wrong. Baby might hate this and scream to be free (like my first), or sleep great only when he's in it (like my second....). You won't know unless you try though.... ;)"
103633,2,"I got the medela free-style pump and these shields come with the pump. After using the pump a few times, I noticed that I had a blister on my areola! My son and I had not changed anything, so I did not think that it was our routine or set up, but I made an appointment with a lactation consultant just in case. When I showed her the blister, which had popped at this point, she said that it was definitely from the pump shields. She said she hated the softfits and had seen this in other moms as well who used these shields. She recommended switching to the hard plastic shields, which I did, and I have had a much more comfortable experience since. They may be more comfortable for some, but beware the blisters!"
16893,1,Out 2 year old was climbing out of his crib so it seemed a good time to transition him to the bed. It's a tight fit with the wooden frame of the bed but it does the job.
70307,2,We have had this gate only a couple months and it has fallen apart. I am now shopping for a new one. Big waste of money.
73915,1,"This is amazing! I got this when my baby was about 6 weeks old, I wish I had it from the beginning. My baby is now almost 8 months and I honestly stopped using it only a week ago. It makes passing off the care for a baby so much easier. The next caregiver knows when the baby ate last, was changed, etc. Also, my baby now loves to play with it as a toy! Of course it isnt baby proof, so obivously I dont leave her alone with it, but it distracts her when she is about to cry and gets her to focus again."
94353,2,"I decided to register for the Avent bottles before my baby was born. I made the mistake of opening all the packages and washing them, leaving me unable to return them if I wasn't happy. Well, I was not happy at all with the bottles. Avent advertises that they are good for reducing colic because of the vented nipple, but I found this to be untrue for my child. She had excessive gas with these bottles and caused much discomfort. I spoke to a few other mothers who said the same thing. The bottles created such a vacuum that my daughter was unable to suck without having to stop often to release the vacuum that was created. I would not recommend these bottles to anyone especially if your baby has colic. I contacted Avent and they told me I wasn't assembling the bottle properly. Needless to say I demanded a refund for the bottles."
38470,1,"The bath pillow is great, I have no complaints about the product--BUT for mothers who are going to breastfeed, think about what is going to happend to your hair for the next few months. For mothers who have longer hair, think about what happends to all your hair when you take a shower. I have medium/long, thick brown hair and breastfeeding; everytime I take a shower, I lose alot of hair. It is everywhere!With this tub, everyday I have to clean my tub out before I give him a bath. I have decide to get a single tub for my son---free from my hair."
130199,1,this swing is wonderfull you have to change the batteries often but it is well worth it and once the batteries are low i use them for my babies bouncer the two motions keeps my little one from getting bored and she loves the light globe
171534,1,"This is the second tub we got and it was well worth the money. We used it for our son from one month to almost one year. The hump in the middle really helped avoid him slipping when we was an infant, and he loved being able to sit up when he got older. And the tray in the back is great for holding shampoo and soap within reach."
22141,0,"If you are like me and pump more than 5 ounces of milk per breast, these bags are too small. Although they can hold slightly more than 5 ounces, it is not recommended to exceed 5 ounces in order to leave enough room for expansion when the milk freezes. Rather than using two and sometimes three Medela bags, I find it easier to pump into the bottles and then pour the milk from both bottles into one larger storage bag (Lansinoh and First Years make larger bags)."
173324,2,"This monitor worked for about 3 weeks and then was terrible. While plugged in, it will shut off for no reason and it took me about 1 week to figure out how to turn it back on, in the meantime, I was sleeping on the sofa so I could hear the baby at night. If I take a step outside it stops working. I hate this monitor and am getting a new one."
71628,0,"I love this little storage cube - it doesn't take up a lot of space and it's great for storing toys and books that are easy for a little one to access, and it can be folded away and stored when not in use.My only complaint is that I wish the little built-in supports in the edges were stronger - while reaching into the tote for a toy my daughter leaned a little too hard I guess and one of the plastic rods snapped and broke. There is no risk of injury - the plastic is completely enclosed in the fabric, however now the tote doesn't stay upright very well if it's not full of something, it droops on one side."
108503,0,"Im not sure if it's all potty trainers, but this thing is gross. Pee gets all up between the cushion and the base and you have to clean it out very frequently. Eventually the smell gets stuck and it's trash. Great product if you need one last nasty potty-training helper before you throw your hands up and say &#34;it's big-potty time!&#34; I recommend a stool. ;)"
100644,1,These fit my son nicely. He weighs 29 pounds. They soak up and hold a good amount of tinkle at night.
83557,1,"It's always very sad to me, to read customer reviews attacking and criticizing other customers who have written reviews. Get over yourself condescending, stuck-up, ""I'm so smart I know how to assemble a safetly rail"" customers!! I guess some things never change. But anyway, I was very pleased with the Safety 1st Secure Lock Bed Rail. We put it on our 2-year-old girl's twin mattress. It was easy and quick to assemble as well."
162523,0,"My baby is 5 months old and has already outgrown this tub. It is great when you have a newborn but, the water capacity isn't great and alot of it drains out. My baby is always cold. It turns into a bath marathon to get her out before she gets too cold. Already have to purchase a new bathtub or just bathe her in the regular tub."
23455,1,"Our baby has reflux and colic...she hates the boppy swing we got her, but likes this glider, it just goes back and forth instead of in an arc (like the swing does) so I think she feels more secure in it, sometimes even falls asleep in it. We've really liked it. The mobile moves around (battery operated) also. We paid less than this for it though...around $50"
70217,2,"We purchased this at Buy Buy Baby (the baby store of Bed, Bath and Beyond) and we're very disappointed with the product. The railing is made of metal and the metal edges have not been smoothed so the seams (where the tubes fit together) are pretty sharp. The metal L-shaped hinges aren't quite 90 degrees so they protrude from the edge of the mattress. The spring-loaded locking pin is just a little nub and does not lock in place. The exposed corners are hard plastic instead of soft padding. All four of these issues are safety concerns. I wouldn't put this on my OWN bed, let alone a small child's. Also, assembly is a bit of a pain. My husband and I are extremely capable of assembling products and furniture (we are avid do-it-yourself-ers) and we both agreed that it was just too much trouble (read: cumbersome) to finish assembling. Needless to say, I was really disappointed to have to shove it all back in the box and return it. My advice is to stay away from ALL of the Regalo Intl products and find something else."
148638,1,"I was put on strict bedrest in the hospital when I was 18 weeks pregnant due to complications. A twin-sized hospital bed is not very comfortable, especially when you're stuck in bed 24/7. I had to lay on my left side the majority of the time, and I thought this pillow might help keep me positioned that way. So, I ordered this pillow and my husband brought it to the hospital for me, and it was truly a lifesaver! I spent just over 4 months literally living in the middle of this pillow. It helped ease my lower back pain that I got from lying down all the time, and it did a great job keeping my on my left side, even when I was sleeping. The pillow was also just so comfy to snuggle up against, especially since I couldn't be home to snuggle up next to my husband. We found replacement covers for the pillow at [...] The pillow itself did wear out in some areas, but considering I was laying in/on it all the time, that was to be expected, considering the frequency and length of time I used it. Overall, I think this is a great pillow for any mom-to-be!"
63661,1,"This shopping cart cover is very cute (pink gingham) - it's very low key and not one of those way too brightly colored covers. My daughter seems to love sitting on it and it is well made and appears to be comfortable as it is very soft. I really just wanted something to cover all the possible parts in the seat of the shopping cart she could touch or put her mouth on and this does the job.As others have pointed out, it does fit better in some carts than others. It seems to fit perfect in Target's shopping cart, but is a bit big for other store's shopping carts. It's fine though because it has the velcro that you can somewhat adjust to get a better fit.I would definitely recommend this product! Excellent price, excellent product!"
113188,0,I like that these are wider like they claim but I really don't like how the length of the tube is longer. I feel like the bottles are now hanging super far away from me. It is a problem because the bottles get weighed down with milk and it pulls harder on my body. Also I like to use the computer when I pump but now i am hitting the desk so I can't.
19497,1,"What a great product. They're strong enough that they don't fall apart when used and I liked the way they glided over my 3-year-old's skin. I also noticed that even though I'd been using two regular Baby Wipes before, I have to use only one Kid Fresh Wipe. I'd recommend Kid Fresh Wipes to anybody who's potty training a child."
1947,1,Cloth like feel and great absorbancy. Plus added value of auto delivery with free shipping!
46006,1,He can stare at it for a very long time. He is mesmerized and it keeps him calm. I wish I had found this sooner!
46532,1,This bed rail is fantastic! We just purchased it to replace theSummer Infant Sure & Secure Mesh Double Bedrailwhich was flimsy and has not held up for even 6 mos. We are using it on our 2 and a half year old boys twin size captain's bed. It was very easy to assemble and it looks great. It is at least twice as sturdy as the other one we had. The stabilizer bar in the middle is a great addition. It folds down easily and makes it simple to make the bed. I highly recommed this product!
161444,1,I have been using this tub with my daughter since she was born and she is almost 2. She is not quite comfortable in the big bath tub so I still continue to use this. I have never had a problem with it leaking at all. I love this product and would buy it for any of my friends when they have babies. I have never used the drain plug because it's easier to just dump the water out of the tub after it has been used. I have tried others before and it broke after the first week of using it. This really is a great product.
37439,1,"I love this product so much that I want to hug it.My now-8-week-old got bad baby acne around 5 weeks old. I wasn't sure it was acne at first, since it quickly spread up her head, under her hair and onto her neck-- but after visiting the pediatrician, they confirmed it. The pediatrician recommended leaving it alone (or washing with White Dial Soap), but I was heartbroken. Her skin looked terrible! What mom can just wait around as it gets worse and worse?A work colleague said that her cousin had used the Mustela Facial Wipes. I went out and bought them (at the red dot store) and used them. Using them twice per day, the acne was 50% better in about 3 days. I could see improvement in the first 24 hours alone. But the wipes are expensive, so I went back and bought this as a long term solution. I put two squirts onto a cotton ball or make up pad (those round disc kind) and use it twice per day. Her skin looks FABULOUS and the acne hasn't come back. This stuff is very thin, basically the consistency of water, and goes on COLD. It isn't super drying. You don't wash it off. The 300ml container, while expensive, will last a lifetime. We leave it on our diaper changing table, so that we remember to use it, and use it once in the morning and once at night.This is a MUST HAVE for any baby with baby acne. I highly recommend it. Even if you aren't 100% sure if it's acne, I'd give it a shot. I love having her beautiful baby skin back!****Pros:* Works wonders on baby acne* not super drying* very cheap per application* 1 container will last a life timeCons:* Fairly strong smell* expensive (but it will probably last 2 years of use)* goes on COLD. Baby cries the first few times you use it, because it's COLD."
42100,2,It was a waste of money. It leaks like anything and everytime my daughter uses it I have to change her cloth. I've used other bad sippy cups but this one was the worst. We used it for 2 days only. I won't recommend this product to anyone... sorry!
3595,0,"I have been reviewing booster car seats because my 3 year old's Century seat is about to expire so she needs a new seat. She is not yet tall or heavy enough to have just the belt positioning--she still needs a harness. I am a little disturbed to read that some reviews state you can go from an infant seat to this booster seat. so please be aware of your baby's size.if your baby is under one year old they SHOULD NOT be in a seat like this. Babies 1 and under should still be rear facing EVEN IF they are over 20lb; the rule is 20lb AND 12 mths old. These types of boosters are made to go forward only. and the height restrictions on these seats are important. even though alot of these types of boosters state 20-40 lbs. the height restrictions usually start around 34-35"". average toddlers meet the weight but NOT the height restrictions so BE careful.there are many choices to choose from in the ""convertible"" type car seats. those are the seats that can go rear OR forward facing; made for babies too big for the infant carrier type seat, not tall enough for a booster, and the convertible usually go up to at least 40lb (many go up to 80lb) so your toddler has time to grow tall enough for a booster.I know it can be inconvenient and frustrating to have to transition your kid through three seats and some can't afford it. but it is worth your kids life. Luckily, there are some seats made that can take your baby from newborn all the way to belt positioning--these are called 3 in 1 seats. they are a bit more in the beginning but you use the seat for six years.The only drawback is that research does show infants are safer in the infant carrier plus its nice not to wake your little one up getting out of the car. so maybe some people could just go from an infant carrier to a 3 in 1--then you only have to buy two seats for one kid."
138133,1,Bought this for my 6 year old neice and it is a hit with everyone. Even my 12 and 10 year old daughter and son wish they could have one in their bedrooms at night. It is adorable.
150437,2,"I bought these even though some people had commented that they were not all cotton, because the product description of the white ones said 100% cotton, so I hoped that maybe only the colored cloths were a poly/cotton blend. But these white ones are also 80% cotton, 20% polyester. They are thin, which I did expect for baby cloths, but I think they are too thin, and cheap feeling. I wouldn't repurchase or recommend these."
106564,1,"I tried to use a friend's Diaper Genie and couldn't figure out how to use it. I got the Diaper Champ after reading [about it]. It was easy to set up and easy to use, just drop the diaper in the cylinder and flip the handle (make sure you wrap it tight to prevent it getting caught). You only need one hand (so you can hold baby with the other). It contains the odor with no problem. Best of all, it's easy to empty, just push on the blue handle with the heel of your hand (no need to break your nails...), take out the old trash bag and put in a new one. No need to worry about running out of a special refill bag like the DG."
125542,1,"We ended up with several of these. My daughter just liked the texture, I think. The ""berry"" part is a little long for smaller babies mouths, but by about 6 months she had the hang of chewing on it wherever teeth were coming in. Even when she was younger this was one that got more use because it is light weight and has a skinny handle for small fingers. Like other reviewers, we bought the single color ones, so I can't speak for the two-tone ones, but ours at least have never come apart. My daughter is a chewer as well: chews on and up everything she can, but these teethers have always remained solid.There is a hollow in the back, which you can fill with water and put in the freezer. My daughter particularly liked them like this. It doesn't last too long so we ended up with more than one so we could rotate. Its true that the water drips out as it melts, but its not more than a good bib can absorb and a little dampness is worth the teething relief."
90801,2,"my son is 19 mos old, so at this point we have tried A LOT of different diaper brands - from target to bj's to huggies to luvs to seventh generation to babies'r'us. we just started using pampers recently - this was only our 2nd box and i have just switched my subscription back to luvs because i've had it with the constant issues i've had with these. they are the most expensive brand out there and so i figured the quality would be top-notch. not the case AT ALL. i have never, repeat NEVER had diaper tabs instantly rip off on me, but it has happened no less than 6 or 7 times per box with these diapers, making them useless (i tried taping the remaining nub to the diaper just so as to not waste them, but it doesn't hold). we also had one of them bust open on us, spilling little gel balls aaaaall over my son's room. i've literally had issues with and had to throw out almost 15 diapers in just the past two months that we've been using them - issues that i've NEVER had with any other diaper brand over 17 months of use. they are truly horrible and way overpriced. the only plus that i can see with these is that they are thinner than the rest. that's about it. back to luvs we go..."
112961,0,"Takes patience and time to put together, that is for sure! Most of the pieces were not even marked!The biggest disappointment was one of the drawers faces being warped!!! Thought the quality could have been a bit better for the money.Now that it is all together, it looks appealing to people that don't know its flaws."
1911,1,this diaper keeps dry my babyespecially it works very well for overnight.very comfort and soft enough for baby
20226,0,"Great bottles, but they leak. And you have to get the rubber ""gasket"" in just right to make sure that the bottom doesn't leak. Also, there are many little parts to wash. Good side is, they do decrease the amount of air that enters your little one's stomach. And the nipples are great. It will not cause nipple confusion if you're breast feeding. The ergonomic shape is great."
148956,1,I love this pillow I am about 5 months pregnant now and I need every pillow I can get. This pillow has replaced all my loose pillows. In other previews they stated that the cover is itchy and rough. It is not 700ct material but this did not bother me a bit I did take the past advice and put an old pillow case over the top. So comfortable that I didn't hear my alarm the first day I used it and I ended up over sleeping :-)
118963,1,My son does not like the confinement of the 5 point harness while he eats - this chair is the perfect solution. We love it! Great quality - very sturdy.
130758,1,"This swing is worth every penny, and it's so much more than a swing. It's a safe place to put baby whenever your arms get too tired, and my baby just loves sitting in it without even swinging. I've used it since he was 1 week old, and he was already captivated by the fishies hanging from above. The chair reclines way back and has tons of padding so you never have to worry about baby's precious head flopping around. It's great for naptime, playtime, fussy time, and so mommy can eat at dinner time! None of the Graco Swings could offer half of what this swing does! I'm very pleased."
149607,1,"This is not a ""mattress"" like your child's bed mattress, it has like foam and stuff in it I would guess. However, for a baby, it works just fine. Our 6 night vacation was a success."
37014,1,"We bought this carseat a few weeks ago when our 2 year old daughter outgrew her convertable seat. I found it very easy to install in the car and it doesn't wiggle from side to side at all. The harness is wonderful, although it does take some time to get used to, and probably a bit more time to do up than other seats would. I really feel like my daughter is safe in this seat, and she loves sitting in it because she can cross her legs and have her arms on the arm rests- more like a big kid. I haven't had any problems yet with the straps twisting, I just like the fact that they are softer than most others. I would definently recommend this seat. We are expecting another baby in June and I am registering for another of these seats to use when he is older."
41299,1,Cruisers provide a good fit with almost no leaking. They're comfy on our little guy. We have tried other brands and prefer this one!
96744,1,This is such a sweet little lamb that makes soothing sounds to comfort infants. It's every bit as cute and cuddly as the picture.
53439,1,"Love this highchair. It is very easy to pack, as it folds down flat, and set up is also simple. My daughter is a very messy eater, and the ease of removing the cover to launder it is very much appreciated. She loved sitting close to the table so much- as opposed to her high chair - that we're probably going to continue using it even when not traveling. One caution is to make sure that your table doesn't have any lips or beams underneath that might prevent the chair from attaching safely."
91613,1,"The Graco TurboBooster Safe Seat in Fairy Tales was easy to put together and install. My daughter is proud to be out of the car seat and into a booster. She is 3 1/2 and her best friends are 6 yr. old twins, all three like it because it's pink and girlie. I like the design, ease of use, and safety features. I do remind my daughter to sit up straight, and she is mature enough to do so. I'm very happy with this purchase,"
154372,2,"Let me preface this review by saying the quality of these wipes is fine and thus the 2 stars. What drives me crazy about these is that they are smaller and although the packaging holds 70 wipes. If you reuse the standard wipes plastic cases like I do. 70 of these wipes barely fills one standard wipes box so here you are struggling to reach the wipes you just filled that are now at the bottom of the box with a dirty diaper and squirming baby! Refill the container with 2 you say?- get this 140 7th Generation wipes still does not fill the standard refill box of 60 wipes. Never again! For the price they should be thicker, larger and fill a standard refill box (which -ahem- reusing these is better for the environment!!) DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
156233,1,"We have been using the Cardinal Gates Kid Shield Clear for a few weeks now and it works great! It makes me feel much better about my little girl leaning up against the railings. Plus, it stops her from throwing stuff down stairs! It looks great since it is clear and not that noticeable. Just have to clean the finger prints off of it every once in awhile."
151764,1,It was the favorite toy of my baby. When he get bigger I put it down and he play with the bears. Beautiful bears!!!!
152949,1,"compared to the other lock, this one has the farthest reach between knobs.good for when there is a vertical piece between doors like the picture.a little harder to work, but you get used to it."
67221,1,"From my daughter, a first-time mom nursing a 3-month-old, ""Love it! It's perfect!"" The angle of the foot support helps a lot. The stool is reasonably priced and well-constructed."
117152,1,diaper dude is one of the best diaper bags ever!! i have it in the camo style and this bag holds everything!!..i recently purchased this one for my sister and she can't wait to use when her baby arrives ..christmas day!!! found it for such a great price on amazon too!!
104002,1,"I posted a review of this product after having it for one day (Scarletsheba) and I wanted to come back to update on what I have found. I have now had this pump for about ten months and I still LOVE this pump. I much prefer it to the PIS that I had (sold and long gone!).After some practice and getting used to the style, I am able to pump twice as much in less time as I was with the PIS.I, amazingly, can pump upwards of 7-8oz PER SIDE (with three to four letdowns) in about 15 minutes. With the PIS I was lucky if I could get 4 ounces per side.With this pump I have never had aches or throbbing like I did with the PIS. I think it's because it more closely simulates the baby's natural sucking. I think people who have posted that they still feel full after using this pump may need to do a little more adjusting of the suction because you should not have this problem.I have not had any clogged ducts or mastitis since getting this pump. Thank goodness.Overall, I still recommend this pump to everyone who asks. I have not had to deal with Aven't customer service as I have not had any problems. I think that as this pump becomes more popular, replacement parts will become available, at least that's the way these things generally work. :)Good luck pumping Mamas!"
36848,1,"My Boppy actually arrived with a tear about four-inches long on the outside curve, but since my due date was quickly approaching I didn't bother to exchange it. I've been meaning to sew it up, but once inside a cover (I have a soft velour one from PBK that I love) you can't tell there's anything wrong with the pillow. I've been using it many times a day for almost four months now, and it continues to perform beautifully."
61322,0,"Perhaps I shouldn't be writing this review since I don't own one of these; however, I thought I might could offer some advise. When I was expecting my first baby I thought this was a great idea and asked other mothers what they thought of this item. One of my friends suggested we save [store] or other plastic bags (checking first to see if there are any holes) and use those to dispose of the stinky offender. I just pull one out of my stash when I'm getting the new diaper and wipes, place it in, tie a knot in the bag near the top of the contents and throw it in my trashcan. It works very well and is much cheaper than buying the Genie and refills."
124000,2,"This product is NOT compatible with the Chicco Keyfit 30, as it is advertised!I went to have my car seat inspected, and the tech found two stress marks in the shell of my daughter's car seat. We quickly realized that they are from the Baby Trend Snap N Go, from the front tabs that the seat rests on. The damage done to the car seat Is not merely cosmetic - it compromises the safety of the car seat.In all fairness, I double checked the instruction manual to make sure I had not used the product incorrectly. I hadn't. Now I have to buy a new car seat because of their false advertising!The car seat tech supervisor recommended I ask Baby Trend to pay for it. Who knows if THAT will happen..."
76694,2,"Not really functional. My son doesn't pee too often while changing, so I lucked out. He does pee every time I bathe him, but we are already in the tub, so I don't worry about this. These are more fun than functional."
125108,1,"I bought this glider for my son and daughter-in-law when they had their baby, and they love it. That was a year ago, and it's holding up well."
87171,1,"I got this seat for my grandson's first visit to Grandma's. He was right at the bottom height & weight limit and it worked great. He figured out that he could pop the seat belt and be free and he really felt like a king on his throne in this seat,especially with the two cup holders. We had to try hard to figure out how to get the seat belt to tuck around the side so it was across the chest properly. He traveled well in this seat. It was a great purchase.Compass Adjustable Folding Booster"
17311,0,This is a very useful product. It works awesome in a dark room too. It even picks us my son's breathing if I turn it up. I get some interference though. But after I fiddle with the antenna for a while I can find a decent reception most of the time.
68616,1,"When I saw the most recent breakdown of general sunscreen safety levels and ingredient information I was honestly horrified. California Baby rated at the top of the list for safety and clean ingredients. It's also the most expensive but with this kind of thing you really are making a conscious investment in the health and safety of your child.I ordered two bottles - one for home and one to leave at her preschool.I love the way this goes on, it is light, smooth and does NOT leave a white residue.The smell is something like a light lemon odor, not unpleasant and goes away quickly.I can slather my daughter, full-body with this without a lot of 'pulling' at the sunscreen to get it to smooth over her skin. It feels like a quality product and we love it!Also, a little bit goes a LONG way so this bottle should last quite a while even with full-body application almost every day."
158389,1,"These cups are great for the very young just learning to use a cup. In my experience the completely spill proof cups require too much work for the child who is not that excited about switching to a cup in the first place. With these cups the opening where the liquid comes out is very narrow so very little will be spilled. That said, my older toddlers do not like the cups because they do not allow sufficient liquid to come out. So I would definitely recommend this cup for the 6-18 month old. However, if you are looking for something for a 2 or 3 year old, I would keep looking."
135597,1,"We own two of these (one for each car). These are the best little boosters. Lightweight, easy to clean, two cup holders. We've had them for 2.5 years and they are still going strong."
172529,2,"Don't waste your money!!! The shower attachment does not work and now I have to return it. Also, the tub is too small for my 2 month old. There is no room for her feet at the bottom. Big dissapointment!!"
39550,1,"Those little legs can get chilly in a onesie, so he likes to wear his sleep sack for lounging around. He can play on his play mat and do tummy time with this on, still kicks his legs with no problem. When I unzip it to change his diaper his legs are always nice and toasty warm. Obviously great for sleeping too."
111538,1,"I highly recommend this product - it's low cost, efficient, and comparable to an electric/battery operated breast pump! Truth be told, I wouldn't have gone w/any other product! While I wasn't able to find the breast pump locally, I was ecstatic when it arrived! If you're having any symptoms of ""cracked nipples"" go w/Lansinoh's Lanolin; it's typically available at most major grocery stores."
180981,0,"I wanted to love this play mat but it's jsut been OK. The music is nice and not annoying like so many others out there. But there are just too many items that do nothing! The giraffe does nothing, the butterflies are on a mobile that doesn't spin mechanically. They are too high for baby to reach so, what is the point? We attached our own toys that were purchased seperatey. The overhanging leaves are annoying when putting baby down and picking up. Our son liked the mirror but it is pointed the wrong way so was useless until he was old enough to grab it and turn it towards himself. He was also able to remove it without my noticing and I caught him chewing on it. The hanging toucan he seems to like ok but the monkey falls out constantly. The mat itself is pretty slippery so it was difficult for him to get enough traction during tummy time to roll over. The first few times he did roll over I put a blanket down on top of the mat. Overall, not bad but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends."
77318,0,"With all the amazing reviews on this swing and the price of it, I admit my expectations were rather high.While my newborn did not like this swing outright, she eventually took to a liking and now it's an essential for her daytime naps. That said, it works for us, but for the price, I have been anything but impressed and have often wondered if a cheaper swing would have worked just as well.Pros:- It's visually attractive. The lights/mobile are nice and my baby is showing more interest in it since she was closer to two months.- It looks soft and comfortable for baby.- Lots of features: speed control, different sound options, lights/mobile options.- Ability to change the direction the swing faces is great for configuring to your liking within your space.- Ability to fold in legs so moving it from room to room makes it a little easier (it's still fairly bulky and awkward to move, though--this is NOT a portable swing, by any means).- I haven't used the battery option, yet, but I like that it is an option if I want to place the swing somewhere where an outlet is not convenient.Cons:- The first thing that struck me was how loud the motor is. When we first turned it on, it sounded like frogs croaking. I thought it was some weird nature sound that was on, but it turns out that's just how it sounds whenever you have the swing on. I've since gotten used to it, but it's a bit obnoxious.- Six speed controls? I hardly see a difference between 1 and 6, let alone 1 and 2, 1 and 3... I honestly think the speed controls are just another selling point feature. It doesn't seem to make much difference which speed setting you have it on.- Stability. We have the swing on hardwood floor and when the swing is going, unless it just happens to be ""just right"", the feet tend to slide around and make annoying squeaking sounds because it will slide and move ever so slightly from the momentum of the swing (My baby is not even 10lbs yet, so I imagine when she gets heavier, this could potentially get even more annoying). For this reason, it makes the construction seem a little bit weak and cheap.- I haven't used the tray yet, but based on how my baby fits in the swing and the angle, it seems awkwardly positioned and it looks like when you put it on, it becomes semi-permanent in the sense that you need to snap it off and on each time you want it out of your way. There's no hinge or easy unlock.All in all, I'm pleased that my baby seems content in the swing during naptime, but for the price, I have to question whether there are options just as good. Based on the plethora of complaints about it not lasting, it's certainly a concern for the future. For now, that's not been a problem for us, but for one of the more expensive swing options out there, I expected a lot more while it is in new and working order."
30525,0,"This tub drives me crazy and I have twin boys so I know it's not just a certain baby that doesn't work good in it. There is this weird lump in the middle where you can sit the baby (when he's too young to sit himself) but if the baby even squirms a tiny bit, he slids off the ""seat"" and then his back is smack in the middle of the lump and his face is about to go under. How would you like a huge hard lump in your back? The little cradle thing that comes with it is silly because it doesn't go down into the water far enough to actually submerge the baby, unless you lower it and then the baby is laying on the lump in the middle again. I wish the product pictures showed the lump thing better, it's always covered by the cradle part. We haven't bought another tub so it's obviously usable, which is why I rated it three stars but I wouldn't buy it again, nor suggest it."
183920,2,"If I could give zero star, I would have done it. The diaper is very thin. It leaked on almost every single one that we used. Don't waste your money buying this."
31042,1,"I have had my Joovy Caboose Ultralight for almost a month and love it. It is light weight and easy to fold and unfold. I have a 3 year old and a newborn, this stroller fit my needs perfect because my 3 year old doesn't like to always ride in a stroller, yet she gets tired of walking. The ""stand"" part of the stroller is perfect for her, she can even sit down on the little bench if she wants too. The only problem I've encountered so far is that when using with an infant seat the older child does not have a lot of room to sit. However, that seems to bother me more than my 3 year old. I have a Peg Perego infant seat and it's fabulous that the Joovy Caboose compatible with that seat. I wish there was more storage, but I new before buying that storage was limited and made adjustments. I bought the J.J. Kole diaper bag system that hangs on the handle (works fabulous). I also bought the parent tray for the Joovy Caboose and that holds everything I need at arms length . . . bottled water, keys, bottle, pacifier, phone . . . I am very satisfied with the stroller and would advise anyone looking at double strollers to consider this. Especially if you have a toddler like mine who doesn't want to just sit in a stroller all the time."
159794,1,"When we were first given this as a gift, we didn't think it would be that special, just another baby seat to put our daughter in when we needed a break.The seat turned out to be comfortable for her from the start, even when she was as young as two weeks. Now that she's over two months old, she's clearly excited and happy when we put her in this chair. The lights and music keep her interested without overstimulating her, and the kicking is a great way for her to burn off some energy.The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that the activator pads under the kick area seem sort of small and are at the very end of the seat, so we've occasionally had to slide her down in the seat to get her feet to reach and she often kicks without hitting the ""magic"" spot, which can get boring or frustrating for her."
128786,1,For our son as a newborn. No problems with cleaning or melting in the dishwasher. Avent products have done us well since our son was born.

56464,0,"These covers are fine. They do the job their supposed to do but are extremely annoying (like most child-proof products)! They are hard to open but after a little while, they get easier. I put them on early (my daughter is 3 months old) so they won't be something new to interest my daughter once she's a toddler. To her, they'll be the same old knobs that have always been there."
134231,1,"If you want a warmer, this is a good one. True, the wipes never brown, but the pad does if you forget to freshen it with water. Fortunately, the company does sell replacement pads. I agree with another reviewer - don't put in the entire wipes pack. If you do, the lid will pop open until the wipes go down in use. It will also take a long time for them to warm as this is a 'bottom up' warmer. Water does accumulate on the inside of the lid and sides, but if you use the pop-up type of wipes, this isn't a huge problem as you won't have to lift the lid. As with any wipes warmer, you must use the wipe as soon as you remove it from the warmer or it will become cold within seconds. This product isn't really necessary for me and my baby (I probably wouldn't register for it if I had it to do over), but I have friends who just love theirs. It just all depends on your diapering style and your baby."
175645,1,This swaddle sleep sacks is perfect for my 5 month old daughter. She's small for her age and it allows plenty of room to grow but is tight enough to be safe. Love this product!
147586,0,"I ordered the 6-12 months hat for my daughter, who is 6.5 months old. The hat barely fits her. I can't expect she'll be able to wear it for long. She has a normal-sized head so I imagine most people don't get to use this hat for long into the 6-12 month period."
39456,1,These are the best! Super warm and wash well. The size xl is just now getting too small. My son can walk fine in these and the sleep sack is part of his bedtime routine.Love it!! We own about 4 of them- in case one gets dirty or such.

Keep up the good work!"
148885,0,"This pillow is nice. It supports my back and belly at the same time. It also helps me to stay sleeping on my side, which doctors recommend during pregnancy. It is quite big, bulky, and heavy. I have a queen bed and there is hardly any room for my husband. The biggest complaint that I have is that the seam on the pillow cuts into my shoulder so badly. To remedy the situation, I sleep with it upside-down (with the bottom of the U shape between my legs). It works, but you don't get the same support as having the pillow right-side up the way it was intended. All in all, I still love it and am glad I bought it."
58390,1,I used this product on my new born son and it serves him well. It never leaks. I bought it through subscribe and save service at Amazon so the price is little cheaper.
14783,1,"I've tried platex disposable, regular bottles, and avent. This is my second child. The first being 10yrs old. I love the shape and size of the Avent bottles. Easy to hold and big mouth openings. I started having trouble with nipples leaking and thought maybe I had over boiled the nipples so I bought more. Then sometimes they would leak. What I discovered is that if one begins to leak I remove the nipple and then then reinsert it and it takes care of the problem. Evidentally when you put the top together when it is still damp it doesn't always make a good seal. Since I've figured that out I have no trouble with leaking any more and I do love the bottle."
1433,1,A friend recommended I try getting diapers this way. Cheaper than coupons and no running to the store. Very convenient for a mom with young children. The diapers came earlier than stated and in perfect condition.
91088,2,"I can't wear this item for more than 30 min. at a time b/c it hurts my back so bad! I've never had back problems, so that's not the issue. It just doesn't have any back support. Save the $20!"
79384,1,"This bag rocks. I just got one a week or so ago. It has room for all the necessary goodies, it's made from recycled plastic bottles AND....it's super light (a must for those with ginormous babies). Comfy...and easy to hand off to guys (who hate the usual baby bags)."

165482,2,I signed up with subscribe and save and receive a case of pampers every 2 months or more frequently. When i signed up i thought i was locking in my rate at the price given then and did notice that it fluctuated by a minimal amount. Now when i received my order once again i was disappointed to notice that the price went up a lot about $10 since I started ordering here. By now the price in not so cheap and i may buy elsewhere.
68800,1,"Pampers Cruisers are the step up from the Swaddlers. I've used them from the day my daughter was born. I've tried others, but nothing works as good as the Pampers products."
130170,1,"We received this swing as a gift for our son and it is one of the best items we got. This swing has the option of swinging front to back OR side to side (a feature few swings have and is wonderful... my son prefers the side to side motion). The fish mobile captured his attention at about 7 weeks and he stares at them happily for minutes at a time (a long time for a little baby!!!!). The songs are pleasant and the battery life is acceptable (we use this for several hours a day and at 10 weeks I haven't replaced them yet). The legs also fold in to make this ""semi-poratble"", at least easier to move from room to room, but not for travel! A must have :)"
81200,0,"i got this for my daughter because evensince she got pregnant, it has been hard for her to get a good night sleep. she likes it and it is better than having a million pillows all over the bed, but she says that it takes time to get use to it. somehow i thought she would have a great night sleep on the first night she used it. mostly she complaints about it being a bit too thick for her neck. she is used to thinner, softer pillows for her head."
19945,1,"Our baby loves to dump things out of containers, so these are awesome for securing his food to his tray. Their stability also makes it easier for him to learn to use a utensil, since he loves to bang his spoon on the bowl. The lids are handy for portability."
176054,1,"I bought this as a changing table/ dresser and I love it! Got it 20% off during the amazon mom sale, so it was less than $300 with free (prime) shipping! I ""supervised"" my dad, brother and husband putting it together and it took about 2 hours. Everything lined up exactly, so if it doesn't line up for you, that could be an indication you have a piece backward. It's a sturdy piece though it would probably tip over if a child climbed on it, so the wall anti-tip kit is a good addition. I bought silver pulls to use instead of the wooden ones it came with (to match another piece of furniture we have) and it really dressed it up!"
96262,0,"When I bought it my daughter was 3.5 month old and she hated it (no matter what position I put her in). After 2-3 minutes of being in this sling she started to cry. My daughter always was very tall and slim (on the 97 percentile for her height)Now when she is 7M old she's ok with it - I think that both of us like the feeling of ""a hug"" that this sling gives, BUT, it is not comfortable.It feels like it is almost falling of my shoulder when she's on the hip position, and I need to adjust it often. In other positions (that I think that she is too big for) it is better.There is also the thing with the fabric, I have the fabric with the espresso color, and even after one use it somehow collects dust or I don't know what, but it looks as if I have a cat and all of its hairs are on it (which I don't).On the up side - it can fold realy small and easy to take with the straller - and use when needed."
25546,0,"I have three children, and I was really getting tired of rinsing so I went ahead and purchased these. When they arrived, I noticed that they weren't flushable for all types of plumbing. My husband definitely didn't want me to take the chance since we have a septic system.At first, I wasn't too disappointed and decided that I'd just use them when I took my baby in public or had to use a rash cream. However, these were so scratchy that my daughter developed a rash from them. I should state that my baby has ridiculously sensitive skin, so this probably wouldn't be a problem for everyone and I'm not giving a lower rating because of it. I just want to mention that if your baby is prone to skin irritations, these may not be for you.These are large, so they can be cut, which helps keep costs down - but they are kind of expensive for what they are. Because of my experience with these, I'm not going to bother trying any other disposable liner and will stick with reusable ones in the future."
146002,1,"We went to TOYS-R-US & tried out a few different jumperoos: The Einstein one & a couple others. THIS BOUNCER is sooo much better than all of those & it was $30 CHEAPER!!!The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because the little elephant doesn't face baby - that was a dumb design on someone's part. But other than that--everything is great. The springs are LOOSE so this bounces VERY easily for baby. The seat is SOOOO comfy and supported my 3 mth old's neck/head VERY well. We put a game box underneath so that her little feet could be supported & she could bounce. Now at 4 mths, she is touching the floor and loving this! I would say that this toy buys me a good consistent 20 minutes each day to get my kitchen cleaned/dishes put away '"
58216,1,"This was one of the best things that we bought for our son. He loves it and it keeps him nice and warm in the cold nh winters! He loves it so much that we use the top as a blanket when he naps, its also very handy when you are out and need a blanket!This makes our life alot easier. We dont have to fight with our son to get him in his carseat.We only wish that we had one with our first child. The only thing that we dislike is that it took a few washes to get the fuzz off,there was this fuzz that kept coming off on our son. At first we didnt like that but after a few washes its all better. Definatly worth every penny! And come spring we will get the lite bundle me!"
41388,0,"This is a good size box for our usage. Living in the city we do not have much storage space, so these keep me from running out of diapers every week, but at the same time don't take up too much space. The diapers in the last couple of orders have been leaving lint on my baby, but this set seems better."
73052,0,"The floppy seat is very plushy, great for beginners at sitting. If they fall they won't get hurt. It is also very big,sometimes too big for highchairs. Also, it takes a little time to get back into it's bag. My son likes the color (I have the blue one) and toy clips. The pocket on the inside is great for putting things as well."
174141,1,"I bought this swing from a friend when I had my first child and absolutely love it. It rocks two different directions which is great, plays different songs/sounds, is comfortable and safe. My daughter just loves it. Since I have had mine three of my friends have bought the same one for their children. I just bought it for a friends shower and she loves it too. Excellent swing."
114512,1,"We were using a full-sized highchair for our 6 month old, but it was huge and took way too much space up in our kitchen. Also, the tray was too high for her. So, we purchased this booster and we all love it. She is able to reach her tray easily and can pick food up from it. I debated between getting this one and one of the space saver highchairs and I'm very glad we got this one. So easy!"
95441,0,"Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is useful. Holds some of the larger toys and stuffed animals like the kind they sell around the holidays. If you are looking for something for smaller toys, I would highly recommend looking at the hanging chains that they sell. I would however recommend this product for the larger toys."
76125,1,"Not much to say...it's an ice cube tray and does the job. I liked that it was BPA free and that's why I bought it. I like that it has a lid, too. It is difficult to get the ice out at first, but if you leave it out for a minute the cubes pop right out."
149443,0,"My three year old grandson likes the cover on this pillow and finds it cuddly, but it's perhaps too complex for him to use just yet as he hasn't got the idea that he needs to hold it in front of himself and rest his head on it. It is also too tall, even with the pieces removed. However, it was easy to cut off another piece that I saved for later. Love the idea, but judgement is still out as to whether he'll use it or not."
176512,1,"I never would have made it without this breast pump! It is amazing! I can't believe how easy it was to use, and it was really inexpensive. Don't waste your money on those pumps that are hundreds of dollars; this pump is all you need. I used it for nine months without a problem. It was especially useful when my milk first came in, and I was really engorged."
125853,2,"If you are a new parent with your first child these are fine as you will probably change the babies diaper every 1 to 2 hours anyway. If you are like me with my third child you will just keep looking at them every once in a while for a saggy diaper or squeeze it for that mush feeling before you change them, then do yourself a favor, avoid these and buy LUVS. Huggies leak before they even get a chance to sag. LUVS are much cheaper and are twice the product that Huggies are."
28867,2,This chair looks nice but we have had nothing but issues with this chair. It breaks all the time - we have had to repair the rocker parts - the arms are always falling off. Terrible chair
98429,0,"my 6 month old kiddo did not agree. Everytime I put him in there he cried ... I'm really not sure why. It doesn't seem uncomfortable - no more than his sling which he had outgrown. I put toys in there, I flipped it over and tried to lay him on his stomach - he was not having any of it. I wanted him to have more freedom, but now that he is developing a mind of his own, well, he definitely expressed his dislike for it. I will be passing this along to my brother and his wife. Perhaps it will work for them. I don't think it is the product, just my son's preference."
80155,0,Good selection of songs from John Lennon's albums that reflect his personal and political journey. Most versions of his songs are very good. Not wild about the version of Cold Turkey -- way too laid back. Most love songs included are pretty good; a few are forgettable. All in all this is one of the best tribute albums I've ever purchased.
101488,0,"I was surprised at how small it was. It's VERY cute, but tiny!"
34572,0,I've owned this diaper pail for almost 2 years and I originally got it because I could use regular trash bags and not special refill bags that get expensive and just add onto you baby expense. Unfortunately this diaper pail does not keep the smell in very well. It does fine for the first 10 to 15 diapers but after that the smell is just horrible. Sometimes I feel like I just have to hold my breath just to be in the room.I'm expecting my second child and I am planning on getting a brand new diaper pail.The First Years Clean Air Diaper Disposal SystemI plan on purchasing The First Years Clean Air Diaper Pail because you can still use regular trash bags and it comes with a filter and fan to keep the smell down.
65201,1,"Not only is this carseat rated one of the safest, but it is great for someone who has limited space in the back seat. My daughter has plenty of room and so does the passenger whose seat is in front of hers (unlike her infant seat - ouch). I love the velcro on the shoulder harness so when you take the shoulder harness off the baby to remove him/her from the car, you can velcro the strap to the side of the seat; that makes it so easy when you put the baby back in the seat - shazam! there's the strap ready to go, no need for digging under the baby. The only downfall I've found is that the velcro stick to her wool sweaters and fuzzes them up a bit, small price to pay and I'll take it! Excellent seat - I am hooked on Britax!"
8841,2,"They don't seem to stick very well. Also, once they did start to come off, I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table."
157300,2,"This was very cute and I loved it. However, after about 2 weeks the upper edges came off when my toddler reached up on them and pulled. It left splintery edges where the screws had been. It was still functional so we sanded them down and kept using it. A few months later the drawers no longer opened and closed properly and it became wobbly and tightening the bolts didnt help. Overall, I think it is adorable, but I wish for the price that it had been better quality. If it was half the price I would have given it a better review - but the long term quality should have been better for such an expensive piece."
61367,2,"I bought this monitor on Saturday to replace one that suddenly stopped working. The low battery light (new 9 volt battery) is already on only days later. I can barely hear my son because of how much static there is. One channel is worse that the other. We live right downtown, so maybe there are other devices interfering? Whatever the reason, I will be returning this product."
147270,1,"Ok, well, maybe I could ask for a few improvements but I think this pack-n-play is great. I love the aesthetics...the pattern is neutral and classy without being cheap looking. Construction-wise, it's sturdy, heavy and well put together. It was easy to assemble at 9 months pregnant and I did it by myself. My daughter loves the vibrating mattress (an added bonus) and the changing area is very useful, though we do not use the wipe holder and our cloth diapers do not fit in the compartment intended for diapers. The only improvement I would make is for the light...it could be a little brighter and better positioned but it's such a minor detail and does not detract from my happiness of this piece."
75813,1,"This seat mat is the best I have ever seen and used. It comes in 2 parts- 1 just for an infant seat and both for any forward facing seats. There is also a part that tucks into the crevice of the seat to keep it from moving. It is able to be used with cars that have the latch system, though I do have to say that the covers are a little wide, but you can still latch the carseat. All in all, this seat cover is the best!"
38540,2,This Safer Bather was a waste!... Even more so it wore horribly! When I called the company I got no were! I got an email stating that they only guarantee there product for 30 days. Mine tore after 3 months of use and they could care less! They were rude and very unfriendly! I say take your business elsewhere!
42054,1,"Very happy with new stroller. Very easy to assemble (under 10 minutes) and maneuver. Took baby for a 45 min. walk and she loved it! The suspension is just right for the size. The under carriage compartment is petite but enough for the essentials. Really liked the adjustable handle bar and front/rear facing combo seat. The mini air pump was not so easy to use ;>), but after a couple of tries was finally able to lock it in place. I had to inflate them twice because I didn't notice I put too much pressure on the rubber wile inflating it (holding it between my knees), thus the tire was a little bit lopsided the firt time."
89937,2,Big mistake buying these diapers. Baby dry technology does not work apparently - got several leaks. Will get Dry Max next time.
82276,1,I bought this for my 2-year old's toddler bed and she absolutely loves it! It is very colorful and the bedding is nice and soft. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with a child that is a fan of Care Bears (it would be adorable as an infant bedding set as well).
177586,0,"I purchased this product because I was going back to work and I heard so many good things about Avent. I love the pump, but the rest of the package stinks. Number one, the ice packs are never frozen. I placed the packs in the freezer over night and they were cold, but not frozen. I took the packs to work and placed them in the freezer. Same thing!By the time I got home the milk I pumped at work was lukewarm the packs didn't remain cold(and yes, I placed the breastmilk in the fridge at work). The insulated bag doesn't work well with the Avent ice packs it came with. I would recommend the pump, but I don't recommend buying the whole set. I used mine for a week and then switched to a $5.00 Baby Innovations cooler bag and $3.00 Especially for Baby Reusable Ice Packs. They stay frozen for several hours. My breast milk was cold to the touch at the end of the day. I would buy the plain thirty dollar Avent pump and buy a cheap cooler and ice packs separately. You'll save about 15 dollars if you do it that way."
10780,1,"I've been pumping breast milk into these bottles for my son since he started ""school"" at 2.5 mos. I have the Medela pump in style pump. I have a few sets of these and the 2.5 ounce Medela freezer set of bottles that look like test tubes. I love that I can pump directly into the bottles and don't have to use the disposable bags. I also love that Medela is a responsible company that makes BPA-free baby products. My only wish was that they had the 6 ounce marking on them - since they do hold 6 ounces. My son loves the nipples. He's a breastfed baby, and had no problem transitioning to the orthodontic nipples at school (2 bottles in the morning) and transitioning back to the breast when he was with me the rest of the day. In fact, these nipples were the only ones that flowed at the correct rate for him). He also likes nuk pacifiers (also the orthodontic shape), so it's likely his preference - each baby is different! Overall, these are fantastic - I'm very pleased."
87587,1,"My daughter is 2 1/2 years old, 32 lbs. and I wanted to get back into jogging. After reviewing many strollers I decided on this one for it's price and features (swivel front tire, rubber tires, tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs). I wasn't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and hasn't complained during any of my runs. It handles great too!! My only complaint is that I have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up. I have a SUV so it has not been a problem, but I must say for me it does not fold flat at all and I am not sure it would fit into a trunk. But, most reviews have have said it folds easy. Not sure what I am missing, but..."
125081,0,"I was all set to use this with my newborn but then when the time came I chickened out. I just wasn't comfortable squeezing it into my sink or putting it in the tub to bathe him. Just something seemed awkward about it, plus tiny newborns are so hard to bathe anyway, as a first time mom I was just too nervous. I ended up running out and getting the big plastic tub that I was desperately trying to avoid. We got the fisher price whale tub, and love it!!!! Now, with that being said. . . we still use the tuckie duckie too. It sits next to the whale tub on the bathroom floor and we let baby hang out on it before he goes in the tub, when we undress him, and right out of the tub when we wrap him in the towel to dry him off. It works great for us as a staging area before we actually get him in the tub. I am really glad we have it. I can't speak to how it dries/or any mildew smells because it never gets submerged in water."
40164,0,"Pampers are by far the best diapers that we have used and are certainly worth 5 stars. The reason I gave them only 3 is because of the price. I can get them at Babies R Us or BJ's Wholesale Club for the exact same price. Why would I pay the additional price of the shipping and buy them from Amazon. I have come to expect the best prices from Amazon, however that is not the case in this situation. I am truly disappointed that Amazon does not have a better price."
3164,1,"This is a great swaddle wrap. I had borrowed a friend's wrap which was a few years old, and my son was able to kick right out of that one. This wrap has more Velcro, which makes the wrap really strong. He's never kicked his legs out, and he's arms have only come out two or three times (probably because I didn't put it on tight enough). I also like the cotton wrap because it's light weight. In the winter he stays quite warm with just his pajamas and the wrap - no need for a T-shirt or socks. I'm really glad that I invested in this wrap, and the bears on the Velcro are really cute, too."
84735,1,"I first got these to keep my son from walking in on people in the bathroom or waking up his younger sister.He soon figured out that (if you place these on the back of a door) if you push the door forcefully enough, they will pop off.Overall I think they work really well and would recommend them to anyone trying to child proof their doors."
95323,1,I received a very expensive video monitor at a baby shower and this one also. After one night I found the expensive monitor had so much static I could barely hear the baby. I tried this monitor out and discovered that I could hear everything clearly and crisply. I don't even have to turn it up very loud to hear my daughter breath. I have now had it for 2 years and still get crystal clear sound. I would suggest this monitor to every new mother.
70274,1,"I am very surprised to see the number of negative comments about this wide spaces swing gate. We purchased and installed this gate and have been extremely pleased with the gate. We were very careful to follow the instructions and using the template to make sure we installed it for optimum operation. Our daughter stands on the bottom rung but she has no way to open the date and with the plastic handle design that requires you to squeeze from the top, we find it very child proof but easy for an adult or teenager to operate.I would recommend this gate and ensure you follow the directions as this is a great gate for the price."
24585,1,We purchased this baby gate and like it very much. I did have to convince my husband to purchase it at the time. We use it in the doorway to our basement and it has been very handy to use the stepper to open it. Our son is now almost two and has stepped on the stepper himself without opening it. It has been safe to our satisfaction. Definitely worth the extra money.
4275,1,"this is by far the best add on accessory for higher end strollers. for some reason, most high end strollers do not come w/ parent bars, why the cheap strollers all do but not the better, more stylish (so more expensive) ones dont i have no idea. i used this on my Maxi-Cozi Foray & it saved the stroller for me - i was about to get rid of it because it has almost no easily accessable storage space. the handle bar was angled at about 45 degrees which means the storage caddy was too but after a little fiddiling it got it to be relaivley level & was very secure/stable. i never spilled my starbucks - who would stroll w/ out a capped cup i have no clue. the caddy holds everything: keys, phone, wallet, extra paci, hand sani & pack of tissues w/ room to shove more little items. love it & have given a few as gifts w/ great thanks."
107468,0,"We have used this travel bag for our Britax Marathon & it fits well. There's plenty of space in the ""seat"" of the carseat to store a few extra things.The fabric is thick, but seems to tear easily on airline luggage loading equipment. After our first trip, it looked as if someone had taken a knife and sliced 2 inch holes in the fabric in spots. We've used the bag (without fixing the holes) multiple times since & they have not spread/frayed. I blamed this on the airline baggage handlers and not so much the fabric.If I were to purchase another carseat travel bag, I would definitely find one with WHEELS. This bag does not have wheels, & it is very cumbersome to carry. The shoulder strap is handy, but I am 5'2"" and it is almost too much to bear trying to carry this through the airport. Wheels are a necessity, even if it costs a bit more.The zipper is strong & sturdy. The shoulder strap clips that attach it to the bag are plastic, but have held up well for the 10+ trips we've used this bag.The fabric is very thick woven shiny type material. Other than the cuts/tears/whatever they are that happened during luggage handling, the fabric has held up well. There are no wear-spots or fading in color. I don't know if the fabric is prone to tearing like ours did, or if it was from catching on something in baggage handling. For this reason, I was glad the bag was on the cheaper side. I didn't really worry about it.If you're looking for a 1 time bag, I would get this bag. It serves it's purpose well for what it costs. If you're a heavy traveler like we are, then I would suggest paying a bit more and getting a bag with wheels. Makes life MUCH easier!"
77540,2,"I got this product and It is beautiful. Everyone in my friends and family liked it. I was proud on my selection. Though very proudly when I was demonstrating how good my swing works to my friends, it failed awkwardly. I tried to change port and do whatever possible- it didn't turn on.Then I used Battery (luckily I hade a dozen of required batteries I bough one year back for Pop-up) It worked- I really disappointed. It was weekend I did not get to talk consumer support. Next day I borrowed Power Adaptor from my friend (he has ocean aquarium) and it worked. For me damage was already done.I don't Expect FP to use the parts which go off in just less than 2 Days.Would I have it purchased in Online- I would never would have thought twice in returning this.One good note on consumer support courtesy- Lady I talked, ordered Adaptor for me (which will take up to 14 days to reach me as she said. Better than having nothing). But kind of product and complaint they have, they should have 24/7 support.Second 14 days are too much to get the fix done.Lesson I learned- I will never buy such big items (in size) online and will try to avoid Fisher Price Product."
106870,1,"I've only been using this product for a couple of weeks and I am completely satisfied with it. It has a locking top feature which is not complicated to work, but is safe for keeping my child out. It works great for my cloth diaper system. I don't use any bag with it, just keep the cloth nappies inside. All smells are retained. Cleaning is a snap.The only minor draw back is that the top piston-style mechanism is heavily weighted and it can surprise you, falling shut while you have it open. Knowing that ahead of time, I have yet to pinch a finger.All being said, I'd buy it again - given the choice."
10051,1,I bought this product for my son. It is a great product and my son seems to be comfortable while sitting. I have two of them and I think their great.
27240,1,"I bought this based on the great review given by the previous poster about her colicky baby. Thankfully she was NOT wrong! I have a 5 week old who has been fussy and high need from the moment he was born. During the day he would only takes nap on me in a carrier and at night he would only fall asleep in bed with me and my husband. My arms and body were getting tired from carrying him all day. He would never sit in his bouncy seat for more then 5 minutes so I was hesitant to purchase another piece of baby equipment thinking it would not help. As I type this he is taking his TWO HOUR nap all by himself! I put on the nature sound, which is white noise, set the swing on the highest level and WOW, I was able to take a shower today for the FIRST time since he's born without someone holding him. I never wanted a swing, but now I am a FIRM believer in the power of motion for an infant!"
162793,1,"I love the snack trap. My only complaint is the accessory pack. It's a waste of money in my opinion. You have to remove the rubber lid to put the cover on it. What am I supposed to do with the lid? I'd have to fish around for it when I want it. I think the cover should fit over the lid. And I have no use for the sippy cup lid. I have sippy cups.The openings do stay open after maybe a year's use. I just bought a new one. My older daughter loves it. She's been using it since she could eat cheerios for about a year and a half.Yes, if my infant shakes it the stuff goes everywhere. I just don't let her have it.Great buy in my opinion."
76290,1,This mobile arrived to Canada very quickly and it's absolutely adorable! I am very pleased with our purchase and would order again without hesitation.
84347,0,I order it for my kid. She like it very much. But the strings attached with the base is not OK
33508,2,This product will not latch properly. You get what you pay for on this one. The plastic is cheap and was broken and chopped when it arrived. The way it latches might be the worst system I have ever seen. It wont stay latched and a 2 week old puppy easily will push it down.I would not trust this with a small child. Complete POS. DO NOT BUY!!
113248,1,I ove Mustela items. I purchase this for all my friends who are having babies! The product is very gentle and smells great. It is not irritating at all.
22954,1,"This is such a beautiful, well-done combination scrapbook/journal! The author thought of everything. If you need a gift for someone who is pregnant (or shopping for yourself) this is the best I've seen out there!"
20843,1,"Great product. My daughter loves them it is quick and easy. They were delivered the next day. Great service. Tanq you!VC,Chicago"
136983,1,"These were really easy to put up, our 4 year old was able to &#34;help&#34; us without much problem. They look great and are sticking well. We had to reposition one and it didn't do any damage to the flat paint finish on the wall."
51690,1,This tractor is great for anyone between the ages of 3 (if they are tall enough) to 6. Big and sturdy - noticable to passing cars. Does not tip over very easily. Easy to assemble.A nice solid toy for your little rough tough child.
177011,1,"I have used this since my daughter was born, from her bassinet to her crib. She has been sleeping all night since she was 8 weeks old. She is now 15 months old and I still use it to put her to sleep and comfort her if she should wake up. It now sits on her dresser and I just use it from there.(she liked to mess with it too much as she got older). I have taken it with me on road trips and the sounds comfort her as if she was at home. I love this product and if I had to pick 5 of my favorites, it would be on top!Yeah, it eats batteries, I have to replace mine about every 3-4 weeks. But so what, she sleeps well and and goes to sleep on her own. And so what if the sounds are not perfect clarity, they work great as &quot;white noise&quot;. I have even put it on a few extra times to put myself to sleep listening through the baby monitor. :)"
132373,1,"I swore to never buy one of these b/c I figured I didn't want my son to rely on a warm wipe, and then get all bent out of shape when all I had was a cold wipe. This was a great theory until he became big enough to squirm and put up a fight come diaper changing time. I figured it was him just being a toddler and &#34;too busy&#34; for diaper time. I came to realize that he detested the cold wipes on his skin. After a few attempts to warm the wipes in my own hands before use, I realized the shock was less, and that maybe I needed to rethink my stance.Thus, I caved and purchased this wipe warmer, and what a difference it has made in our changing routine. No more blood curdling screams. No more squirming to the point of almost falling off the table. In fact, my 16 month old son actually helps me now by lifting up his legs while I clean the mess. WOW!! Are you kidding me?This warmer keeps the wipes pleasantly warm (not too hot) and dispenses the wipes very well. I haven't once had a jam or lost wipe. This is very important for the impatient wiper like my husband.It also offers a dim night light. My son gets a kick out of pushing the button and now knows he gets to push it once diaper change time is over.All-in-all...a great purchase. Just annoyed with myself that I waited this long to get one. Lesson learned for when we decide to have baby #2."
18677,2,"I ordered the Miracle Blanket because a few of my friends swore by its magical powers. Unfortunately, my three month old was way too long, so he could easily kick his way out of the foot slot. After he successfully removed his legs from the blanket, he was wide awake. This scenario occurred for three consecutive nights, and I gave up on the Miracle. Either I have a Houdini, or this is not the miracle most people need for their older newborn."
14326,1,"I have eight children,the oldest is 16 and the youngest is 1. I used the playtex bottles with bags for my oldest,she had reflux and these bottles didn't help,for my other children I decided to try the Avent bottles because they claimed to help prevent gas. With my second daughter who also had reflux they did exactly what they claimed to do. My other children that did not have reflux had very little gas and on those late night feedings if I didn't get a burp or was to tiered and forgot I never ended up having my baby fussy because of gas pains.these are the best bottles and well worth the price!!!"
184719,2,"I received this book as a gift and have been debating whether to give it away or not. Only thing keeping me from doing so is the thought that the gift-giver may someday want to see it! The book is HUGE and doesn't fit on any normal book shelf. It is incredibly bulky, heavy, and the wood cover makes it cumbersome. It requires way too much information and does not provide enough creativity to add in things that might be unique to your child. Many of the pages have long lists of entries - so if a few apply to your child the page looks essentially blank and you look like a bad parent. Would NOT recommend this book - everytime I open it I feel delinquent for not knowing the answers to all of the questions it is asking! Plus - it goes up until your child is practically in high school - some apparently like this aspect of the book - I find it to be way too much!"
68932,2,"We were disappointed to see that Pampers changed their diapers without notifying consumers. The biggest complaint we have was the removal of the mesh liner - which was the whole reason we were loyal to buying Pampers Cruisers. These diapers give our daughter a horrible rash now every time she wears one. We have since switched to cloth and will not buy any Pampers product again unless they bring back the old liner. There is also NO absorbent layer on the entire back panel of the diaper! If DD is laying on her back, it all just comes right out the back side! They are an inferior product now, but still charging premium prices. I'd rather buy a store brand at this point, if I weren't totally giving up on disposables altogether! Very upset about this change. We used to love them, and have been buying them since DD was born - but no more."
39364,1,"I love these sleepsacks. I have both the fleece and cotton versions. They are an excellent, safe alternative to using blankets in the crib. Blankets are not the best choice these days as they aren't safe (increases SIDS risk) and can easily be kicked off, leaving baby cold and crying. These were a natural next step to use after my baby outgrew the swadde (around 4 months). I plan to keep getting larger sizes as my baby grows. I love this product and would suggest it to all parents and caregivers out there."
64145,1,"I bought several other teethers before finally deciding to spring for this one. I wish I had started with this one! My kid loves this one, it's easy to hold and you can't put it in your mouth the wrong way (there is no wrong way) It even comes with a plastic case so it won't get dirty in the diaper bag.My baby is 8 months with no teeth, so I'm not sure what the point of the ""4 months"" label is."
120192,1,"I hesitated to buy these because of the cost, but they are really a lifesaver. I recommend cutting them in half, because they are much larger than you need. I precut a bunch for my pump bag and store in a ziploc, and use one a day to clean parts. I pump three times at work but only carry two sets of parts, so these allow me to reuse a set later in the day. Honestly I use that wipe to dry the parts after the other two pumps, but just to repack and wash for real in the evening. I don't have access to a sink other than the bathroom, and I find the use of these wipes more sanitary than that option!"
6499,1,"My 5 year old autistic son is just starting to potty train, but he still needs to wear diapers most of the time. The size 6 cruisers are the only size 6 diapers that will fit around his 5 year old frame. They do not leak."
147446,0,"In public pools where swim diapers are required these work. I personally like the pamper ones more than the huggies ones, but not sure if Amazon.com carries them. I wish swim diapers were a little more reasonably priced!"
172188,0,"This tub was nice for the first 5 months. We used it in the kitchen sink and then in the bathtub. The mesh hammock was perfect for when she was newborn. The infant side was great after that. The 'toddler' side I don't know about. After she was sitting up on her own it was hard to bath her in it on either side. We got a new tub-the big ducky inflateable one available at target. So it lasted for 5 months which is good for the price, but not beyond that"
102076,0,"It's a nice Hello Kitty stuffed doll and looks great. However, the glue holding Kitty down hasn't held her down since the day I bought it. I tried to glue her down again but nothing works. It matches the crib set and once we move on to something else, it will be donated."
50938,1,Love it. Can't believe I ever survived without a Snoogle. Would recommend it to anyone - pregnant or not. Absolutely worth every penny.
38016,0,"While our son was little we essentially used this as a travel system, and LOVED it. His car seat clipped in easily, and the stroller is VERY maneuverable. Big, rubber tires make it easy to go up curbs, over gravelly paths, cracked sidewalks, etc. The big mesh carrier under the seat is great for groceries, spare blankets and toys, diaper bags, etc.I really only have one big complaint with it. Now that our son is old enough to sit in the main part of the stroller, we are fastening him in with the harness, and the center between-the-leg strap is MUCH too short and close to the rear of the seat. When we put our son in the seat, he is essentially sitting on the strap, and because it is so short, we have to lift him up to buckle it, and the buckle ends up UNDER his crotch instead of in front of it. We've looked several times for a way to extend the strap (it's such a well-designed stroller in other respects we have a hard time believing this major design flaw is for real), but no such luck."
42337,1,"it's the middle of the night, I am up with my nine-day-old son, and he's wrapped in the blessed, brilliant, magnificent Moby wrap, for which I am considering adding to my religious beliefs, or possibly my sexual orientation. I love this thing. It fits us both, it's easy to get my little guy into, he snuggles in and sacks out immediately, and it's so comfortable! So comfortable. The first week I nearly threw out my back holding my ten-plus pound chunk of a newborn in one arm, then the other, then the one, then the other, world without end, amen. Now I just wrap up, pop him in, he snuggles down, I do a couple easy laps of the house while humming a little song, and then I sit down and check email (and post reviews of baby gear on Amazon) while he falls deeply asleep enough to be out down again.Don't be fussed because it looks hard to wrap. You'll be fine after two tries with the (very comprehensive) little booklet, and then you'll be bopping around the house like a pro: slicing bread, folding laundry, reading the paper, all the while with your kid tucked up under your chin snoring those soft little heart-melting snores."
106269,2,"We got the diaper champ as a shower gift. The one good thing about it is that you can use regular trash bags, so you don't have to buy specialty bags to fill it. The bad thing is that if you don't change it every other day, it stinks up the whole house. I have to bleach it once a week, not to mention keep a box of baking soda in the bottom to help control the smell. My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second. We are planning on getting rid of the diaper champ, and upgrading to diaper dekor."
43444,1,I've been very happy with this stroller skeleton. It's quick and easy to use. We use it with the Graco Snugride 32 and it fits perfect. Very snug and secure. I would buy this again and recommend it to a friend.
29640,1,"These wall hangings go great with the crib set that matches it, and make it really easy to add decorative touches to the room. We hung them three in a row tied in bows and hanging on a small nail."
173997,0,"When our son was first born we loved this swing, and so did he. However, he was a big baby (10 lbs 2 ounces at birth) and although this swing says it can hold up to 24 lbs, it no longer works for Kaden and he is only 16 lbs. When he is in it the motor isn't strong enough to make it swing more than a couple of inches either way, also, his weight makes the music sounds garbled and is obviously rough on the motor. We had to pack it up for the next baby, Kaden is only 3 months old and we really wish he would have been able to use this longer!"
78381,2,"At first glance, this appears to be the ideal booster seat. It does fold up easily and the interior of the chair is easy to clean after each meal. HOWEVER, be forewarned. If you don't mind cleaning up food that has been sent flying through the air by your clever little one, then this is the chair for you. Our daughter figured out how to send the tray and it's contents sailing through the air when she decided she was finished eating. I would recommend the older safety first model which had a better locking mechanism. But they are rare and hard to find. Don't try customer service, they will not take the chair back, and refused to believe that there was a problem. As you can see from several other reviewers, there is a problem with this product. Good luck!"
134904,2,NOT made for frequent use. Almost as soon as we installed it it became loose and started to pull out of the wall (with studs). Is not easy to use one handed and half the plastic pieces broke this morning so now I am looking for replacement parts. Would not reccommend. The other stairs has a safeway metal gate on it and it has been great.
15206,0,"We live in an apartment and wanted to make sure the whole place wouldn't smell gross. Diaper genie keeps the smell out, NO ODOR. Our son is 5 months now, and eating solids. *Sometimes* I get a little whiff as I'm emptying the thing (boy, are the poopy ones are bad) which is fine- it's only a split second. Diaper genie does it's job wonderfully. I'd give this thing 5 stars for no smell, but 1 star for the price of refills. Speaking of that...There's a way to *not* buy refills everytime. I don't know how in the world people are using the refills everytime for this thing-It's too expensive!!!! We empty ours once a week now. We bought just one refill and put trash bags into that refill. It only takes 1 minute to stuff a trash bag into the refill carton so it's no extra trouble. We buy trash bags in bulk from cosco so it's a fraction of the cost. Also, we find it's best to use a drawstring type trashbag. It stays in the genie refill carton perfectly. (you're just stuffing the ""draw string"" part of the bag in the refill carton). We fold up the poopy diapers neatly OR put runny poopy diapers in a grocery bag first before putting them into the genie, so the yuckiness doesn't get on the exposed part of the trashbag. We haven't bought another refill since we started doing this 4 months ago. I hope new parents are trying this Before buying refills everytime. Sure, the refill will last a few weeks when your baby is first born, but that phase will end quickly."
154457,0,good wipes. stopped getting them when they tripled the price. they are pretty much wipes but they smell a little weird.liked them because they come in a bunch of small packages. most bulk wipes come in 3-4 huge packs.
55211,1,"In the grand scheme of things, I don't know whether you child will get toilet trained faster, but my 2 y.o. was just not coordinated enough to step up and twirl around on those tiny $30 toddler stools to sit on the potty... either that or I think he was going to tear the toilet paper dispenser right off the wall. Despite my great hesitancy to buy something that cost 5x as much (vs. total cost with shipping vs. my Amazon Prime two-day shipping) I pulled the trigger on this item and I'm quite happy with it. My kid took an immediate liking to the handles and devices and enjoyed climbing on it. Although it is plastic, it is very sturdy and well constructed. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a head start on potty training."
118675,2,"it has no suction at all, at least this one don't. I have a little piece of wax in my ear I have been trying to get out for a very long time, this ear wax cleaner does nothing. I'm very disapointed. Thought at least it would suck out the wax.It would be a fantastic product if it sucked things out of your ear like they say it will.I chose this product cause they said it would suck the water and wax out of your ear, well this one does nothing.I would NOT recomend this to any one. It don't do anything they advertised it to do. Very disapointed."
90288,0,"The product quality has detiorated over the past one year. We have been using Pampers ever since my baby girl started using diapers. Of late, there has been several instances where the diaper does not hold up enough liquid as it used to, it wets the pants very often. I am unhappy with the shipments coming from Amazon too, the carton packages are most damaged when it arrives. Does not make me feel safe although the diapers are protected with the plastic foil inside. The price point is good, which is the only positive aspect to mention."
53635,2,Important info left out of the details of the chair...won't fit a table with a skirt under the table top. I tried this chair on 3 different tables and unfortunately would not fit. I am returning the chair. They should have put better details in the product info.
119853,2,"Its ok. It served its purpose, but it is not worth the price. I would have gotten something more padded. The pad is pretty thin. I would have spent another $20 to get something with better quality more bells and whistles."
32090,1,"Mine arrived well packaged, but had weird white spots on it...they came right off with a baby wipe though. I think it might have been oil spots from the machinery it was made on, but it looked like mold! Installation was easy, but the string that ties the bottom edge to my seat back doesn't seem to want to stay tied. Still works fine, though, and looks nice."
143195,0,"I bought one set of these caps because I'd never tried them before. I am using DrBrown bottles again with my second child and thought I might need these caps. While they do fit nicely on the bottles, I don't know that there is enough difference between them and the Medela and Similac caps that I already had. I will continue to use them, but I will not be buying any more of them. Also, for those that might be curious, they DO NOT FIT OVER THE CENTER INSERT FOR THE BOTTLES. Part of the reason I bought a set to try was to see if they would fit over that center insert. This would have been ideal for prepping a bottle for travel, but no, they don't work that way. You end up with a capped bottle, a center insert, and a bottle top with nipple."
16326,1,"excellent quality, easy to carry, easy to clean, easy to fold. I highly recommend this especially if you are bringing a baby to the beach or to lay on the grass."
132148,2,"Bought this laminated baby bag from seller. Bought product as new. The bag included a changing pad prepackaged and placed within baby bag. When we opened the changing pad there were blood and fecal stains! Yuck. This is a biohazard. Went to return bag for a replacement and seller/amazon will not allow replacement. That is okay, will return and get refund....not sure what else we would find if we got another bag from this seller."
75262,1,"After weeks and weeks online researching and stressing over buying a breast pump I made the decision to buy the Lansinoh double electric pump, and it was the best decision I've made since I decided to exclusively breastfeed! I know what you're thinking...everyone else I know has bought a Medela pump and they're so popular and there are more options and blah, blah, blah. What it basically comes down to (as I'm sure any research you've done has already shown you) the only difference between these two brands is that the Lansinoh pump doesn't come with a tote bag and cooler for the milk. Really, that's it...that's the only difference. So then ask yourself: ""Do I really want to pay upwards of $150 MORE for a tote bag with a picture holder, 4 bottles, and small cooler?"" The answer for me was NO WAY! So I decided to buy the Lansinoh pump and use a cute tote bag I already had from traveling and buy a cooler for the milk. (You can get the perfect coolers here on amazon.com, just search for: bottle cooler). I did also purchase a back up accessories kit just incase anything broke or wore out, but you'll need that no water what pump you use. Now for the more practical review:PERFORMANCE: I have used this pump at least 3 times every work day and once on the weekends since my daughter was 8 weeks old and haven't had one problem with it. I have replaced the valves once, but that was more preventative than a problem with the parts. I have used it with the power adapter and batteries. I have been able to get around thirty 25 minute pumping sessions (two work weeks) with each set of 6 AA batteries. I prefer to use the batteries because it's one less thing to set up when I'm pumping at work, but both ways are easy and quick. This pump is also great because you can control the speed and strength of the pump. I have it set to almost full speed and about level 2 of 10 on the strength and can pump more than the 5 ounces that my daughter needs for each feeding. I haven't had to increase the strength at all, so the motor hasn't wore out or failed in any way.COST: obviously if you read above this pump is a great deal compared to the more expensive Medela PIS pumps out there. The additional parts kit I bought was only $17 online and I haven't even had to use any of them yet.EASE OF USE: This pump is super easy to set up/break down and I am able to pump for upwards of 25 minutes each session at work...and I only get the room for 30 minutes!! The parts are all very durable and easy to assemble. The only issue I had to figure out was how I could use the pump and keep my hands free...but that will be an issue for all of you using a double pump. (Let me recommend this link for the easiest way to use a breast pump hands free: http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/hands-free-pumping.html , it is a lifesaver!!). This pump also has two ""cup holders"" on the top of the pump that you can use before or after pumping to hold the bottles in place. This is especially handy after pumping because you don't want to risk spilling any of that liquid gold!One other note, if you are going to buy additional bottles to pump into, beware of the Lansinoh bottles that are sold separately from the pump. These will fit into the horns on the pump, but they DO NOT fit into the ""cup holders"" on the pump. It may not be a big deal to you, but I worry too much about spilling anything while I pump at work and I haven't used them since the first time for this reason.All in all this pump is working perfectly for this full time working mom and I wouldn't ever think of buying anything else!Here's a link to a great product review on The Lactivist: http://thelactivist.blogspot.com/2007/01/product-review-lansinoh-double.html"
81154,2,"i got 2 of these wetbags as gifts. my blue one had the stitching start unraveling after less than a month of use. the red one had the zipper pull fall off after 4 months. both of these leaked thru the PUL (and not with soaking diapers inside). they are a great size for travel, but i can't use them anymore b/c they are falling apart.**UPDATE: i tried to contact manufacturer. they said i must contact the place i purchased the wetbags. Amazon said i could not return unless it was in new condition. if it was in new condition, i wouldn't need to return. they (amazon) suggested i try to sell the wetbags as ""used"" on their site. anyone want a non-functioning wetbag?"
181074,0,"this set is OK it has a lot of toys, in my opinion not all baby are the same and not all will like the same tastes but this gym has a variety of toys.the toys are good looking i really like the giraffe. i bought this for a present."
177444,1,"After reading about many different pumps, I bought this set for going back to work. No one realizes there ia a pump in this bag! It looks like a lunch bag or purse. Lactation consultants at the hospital insisted that working moms need electric pumps - not true! This affordable pump is very effective for me - I can get 8 ounces in about 15 minutes. No noise, lightweight, and very discreet."
30015,0,"This is a fine product for the price. The quilt is really cute and all accessories are holding up very well. However, the bumper doesn't tie at each corner, it does fall short at almost every side. The crib skirt is pretty flimzy and difficult to put on. But it's a pretty set and I think worth the low cost. Also, I wouldn't describe the blue as any variation of navy; it is much lighter, more like cornflower."
102930,2,"I thought I would like this one...seemed easy to use, and didn't require special refills. I got it home and the push button on the top of the pail to open it was already broken. I didnt get a good vibe that this was gonna last if I returned it for another one. Im definately going with the Diaper Champ. Its a little more money, but the idea behind it makes a lot of sense, and it seems that it will live up to its name."
57114,1,"This gate is perfect for my new puppy. It was really easy to install, and stays in place well. Even with baseboards, it was easy to secure."
169197,2,"My baby is 16 pounds. Pampers Size 2 is up to 18 pounds, so they do fit on her, but somehow she's had serious diaper rash by wearing them in the past few days. I know these diapers might be a little tight for her, but she didn't have diaper rash while wearing Huggies Size 2 whioh were also a bit tight."
127251,1,"We really like the way this crib looks. The wood is soft, so it does ding a bit, but you don't really notice the dings unless you look very closely. Friends of ours have the Emily crib and after 2 years, they are still happy with it. We love the fact that it has no pressboard in it or any weird-smelling chemicals."
149154,2,"I tried this pillow during my pregnancy at various stages and it did nothing for me. It is gigantic and hard to move around. It is overstuffed and uncomfortable. All of the curves hit me at the wrong places, maybe I am too tall for this pillow at 5'9"". It is expensive and costs a lot to ship back, so make sure you really, really want this big uncomfortable pillow before you buy it."
168748,1,Best diaper my BABY has tried. I have a 3 month old who can blast his poop and spray urine like a fireman on a 10 alarm blaze! These bad boys do a GREAT job absorbing the mess and keeping it from leaking through the legs or the belly. Other diapers would leak but the elastic IF properly placed flush against the legs does a great job!Make sure to put it on carefully and it will do a great job.
143800,0,"This is a beautiful freestanding gate. We bought 2 of them. They go well with our hardwood floors. However, the assembly didn't make sense - the bolts provided were not long enough, and there were only holes on one side of the wood. Even if it had worked, you would have to unbolt it in order to adjust the length. We were able to use the gates despite the adjustment bolt not being used. It works great for our small puppy, which is why we got it. However, our older dog, which is a medium large dog (about 60 lbs) has no trouble at all pushing it aside if he wants out."
162507,1,"I've been using this tub since my daughter was a couple of months old, and I'm sorry that at five months she's finally growing out of it. The fact that it easily folds up made it perfect for my small home, and it fits nicely over my double sink, which makes bathing her easy on my back. The non-slip foam pad and contour design make it comfortable, too. This is a great tub at a great price, and it's one of the best baby products I've used so far!"
163967,1,"This bag always draws attention. I was amazed to find that its selling much cheaper at amazon than other places. I couldnt resist buying it.I have twins and wanted something spacious and sophisticated for occasional use.I would say this bag is quite sophisticated. The fabric and inner lining are high quality. Even the dad loves to carry it. The accessories are very handy. I use the changing pad and wipes dispenser every day.For a single baby, the bag is very spacious. Has lots of pockets. For twins, its ok. It cannot carry a lot of items. It gets crowded and difficult to pull out items from the bag.But still I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase."
165152,1,"Have been using the pampers since she was born. Love the brand, product. Been using Amazon mom and cannot beat the prices."
63597,0,"I've been using this with my baby for 3 1/2 months now. It does work well and as long as you get the bottle out as soon as the light turns green and the chime goes, it won't overheat. If you leave it in there - it will get too hot pretty quickly. The problem with this unit is that it takes way too long to heat a bottle when you have a screaming hungry baby in the middle of the night. On average I heat about 4 oz at a time and it takes over 5 minutes, which doesn't sound long, but at 3 am with a screaming baby, 5 minutes is a REALLY long time. Also, you pretty much have to ignore the fill lines and use trial and error to get the right amount of water in there. If you add too much water it will take even longer to warm the milk, and if you use too little it will come out still cold.A lot of these issues seem to be common with bottle warmers, however, so I would say if you are just looking for a cheap warmer and can stand the wait, this one does function well. Just be prepared for the longest 5 minutes of your life in the middle of the night!!!"
174694,1,"I bought this tray for my grandaughter. What I liked about it and what cought my eye is that it had four compartments. Most of the other trays I've seen had only three. The extra place for food certainly comes in handy. Since I babysit for her two days a week, I myself am finding the Baby Cie feeding dish very handy and helpful. I can dish out all the different foods she is learning to eat and not have a mess of different bowls in front of me. It is extremely easy to clean up as well and seems to take a beating with no dents and no scratches. It also comes in a nice variety of patterns and colors to match almost any decor. Its a good plate and feeding dish for the money."
5522,2,While the idea was good the execution was poor. The suction cup is so weak that the one year old had no trouble at all ripping it up from whatever surface it was on. Warm water put in the bottom leaks out and the inside of the tank never dries.
143440,2,"Firstly, the product we received is not Ameda it is Bailey Nurture III. My wife indicated that this did not have much suction and was not as effective as her manual pump, even when only pumping from one side at a time. The product in my opinion is unsatisfactory, and if I purchase another one for her later, I will be doing a little more research before buying one."
78889,1,"It's the only place for directions about how to hook the car seat to your suitcase. My oops, but maybe there's a way to sew the directions on for those of us who are spacially or mechanically challenged and can't ""see"" how it's done just by looking at both teh car seat and the travel accessory."
96346,0,"My son breastfeeds and never used a sippy until 10 months old, and this was his first cup. He learned to use it after about 10 minutes. I waited until he was really thirsty to give it a try. He only gets water in it, so the spray effect that occurs doesn't worry me too much. The aspects of these cups that bother me are:1. Leaks while laying on its side.2. Leaks while tilted upside down and slider lid is open (water exits from straw hole, not from straw).3. Food collects in straw above the valve.4. Texture of plastic makes it very slippery if, for example, the child has yogurt on his hands and then grasps the cup. My son, and I, drop the cup frequently in these circumstances. He also has trouble picking it up sometimes.One would think that Nuby's R&D; department would have discovered these significant flaws before mass marketing them.Other readers have commented that using a dishwasher and ""figuring out how to assemble it properly"" stops these problems. We don't use a dishwasher, but I have sterilized it in boiling water to no effect. And I can't figure out the ""proper way"" to assemble it, so if anyone could offer guidance I would greatly appreciate it.Overall, the cup does the trick, but with major flaws. Perhaps this will inspire me to move my son onto a regular cup."
176442,2,"When I first went to use this pump, I couldnt get it to suction. After a while me and my husband figured out it was the suction cup that wasnt letting it suck. WE luckly had the ones from the hospital that worked on this pump. It is VERY loud. It works okay, it does hurt to use but it gets the milk out. Am planning on buys another one today."
153890,1,"These wipes are good, they do a decent job, but I initially bought them because they are made by Seventh Generation and I like that they are earth friendly. I use Seventh Generation diapers and think those are great! Unfortunately, in regard to the wipes, I went back to using Pampers Thick wipes because I felt like these were a little too thin."
96341,2,"Seems my 20 mo old toddler has found a way for this one to leak fairly easily. He just turns it upside down and shakes or bangs on the table. It is fine for most applications though. We took this one on our last flight and water started coming, squirting out under cabin pressure, so not good for flying."
147839,1,"We gate checked our Chicco Key fit 30 stroller and this item protected the stroller's fabric from getting dirty. It was also very easy to identify when we picked it up from the door. There was some wear from dragging. However, I'm glad the wear happened on the bag and not my stroller."
60690,2,"I am very disappointed with this product. I have heard all the bad reviews but thought maybe it was the people using it, well I guess I am one of the people using it because I think it stinks. It may be okay for the larger diapers but for the infant diapers it does not hold them right you have to push it down and then everytime I twist the cap it rips and I have to start all over. At first I thought maybe my husband didn't put it together correctly but after taking it out and putting it back together 3 times I figure if it is that hard to change each refill it is not worth my time. With a 3 week old I can't be bothered with anything that takes that much effort to work."
93630,1,"My son loves this chair and we have not had any problems with the sounds.... we just replaced the batteries when needed. We have a blues clues seat that we put on our ""big"" potty, but he likes this much better. It's less scary for him, especially for poopy time. Every kid potty trains differently and has their preferences, but this works well for us. The splash guard works fine (my guy is good at pointing down when he pees) and doesn't cause any discomfort."
164299,2,"These diapers do not work at all! We had been using Pampers Swaddlers and they are great. Unfortunately, I saw that I could buy these for a few dollars cheaper and decided to try them out. They do not work. We have been using them for about a week and EVERY time my son has a poopy diaper, it's a complete blow out. Even when he is upright, it somehow leaks out the top of the back of the diaper. We had been using the Swaddlers and only had one blow out in 4 months. Maybe these diapers work with older children with firmer stools, but they do not work at all for us at this age. Besides the constant blow outs, these diapers have a plastic, cheap feeling. Pampers should be ashamed to put their name on them. So, instead of saving a few dollars, I'm now buying new diapers even when I have around 200 of these diapers left."
158497,1,"I like these sleep sacks quite a bit. You can get different weights, which keep your baby warmer (obviously).Here are my two little gripes:1. My baby is tall and skinny. She is 1 year now, and 21# but 32 inches. Therefore, she's pushing the upper limits on the length of the large but not even in the weight range. The consequence is that the sack is gappy across her chest but her toes are near the end of the blanket.2. I would love a 2-way zipper. It was a bit of a pain trying to zip her into the sack when she had already fallen asleep. It was dark and I fumbled with the zipper, trying not to wake the baby. haha. Not a huge gripe, but still takes it down a notch from ideal.Otherwise, I like them a lot! My daughter is kept warm but not overheated and she can move around comfortably. The quality is great.Definitely recommend if your baby is right in the middle of the range or a little chunky as there is a lot of room in there!"
104841,2,"I just wanted to write this review because this product should NOT be sold! I have NEVER written a review on a product before, but this is such poor craftsmanship that I felt I had to write something and help at least 1 person from buying this bookshelf. It seemed like a great idea, but I cannot describe how flimsy and cheap this bookshelf really is. Being handy, I have built this bookcase up, but its still difficult making the functional. I wouldn't pay $5 for this brand new at a garage sale. Don't buy this"
61119,2,"Every baby magazine in the world boasts that this is one of those products no parents should be without... they are mistaken. I will admit the concept is good, but the Diaper Gene seriously lacks what it promises! The ultimate worst is how many times you have to empty this pail! When my son was in newborn and size one diapers it was great... then when he got into bigger sizes, forget it! AND IT DOESN'T KEEP ODORS AWAY! Which it claims it's the best for! The Diaper Gene is supposed to make a chain of diapers, after time went on mine would contain two to three diapers in one link! Finally I got tired of messing with it and tossed it away. I went straight to Babies R Us and bought the Diaper Champ! Which I am totally satisfied with! The Diaper Champ KO's the Gene!"
152386,2,"This didn't work at all for my 13 month old. It's pretty flexible plastic so she was able to just go up and pull it away from the machine and push the buttons anyway. Also, you attach it with squares of hook and loop and when the machine warms up they let go. Maybe if I had started using it sooner it would work better into fooling her that she couldn't push buttons. But if you have a curious and busy toddler like mine with any persistence at all, this probably isn't going to work very well."
127570,2,"I expected the product to be lot more sturdy. I purchased based on the reviews posted earlier, however I was a little disappointed with the sturdiness of the crib. It is definitely good looking and get VERY easily scratched. By the time I was done with the assembly it had a lot of scratches. Little disappointed with the product."
174834,1,"These clippers work well if you know how to use them. You have to hold them opposite of what you would think in order to get a good, clean cut."
96837,1,Our son LOVES this~it DEFINITELY soothes him and helps him fall asleep! I think this would make a great shower gift!
81466,1,"I no longer have to grab multiple items to change my baby's diaper. When I'm out of the house, it is so easy to grap my Diapees and Wipees and know that I have everything that I need. It can fit wipes, 3 diapers and a disposable changing pad."
5473,1,"I really enjoy having this item in my car. I am a nanny and drive the two children I keep around. They are very clean children and have not made a mess yet; but I know when it does happen, this product will come in very handy. I have not really used the item yet, but I know when I do it will work. It was just what I expected and needed. It looks like it would be very heavy duty and sturdy and if I don't use it as a trash can, I can used it for storage. It is discrete, nothing about it screams nasty, stinky trash can. I am very happy with it!"
178741,2,"Bought it for my son when he's about 6 month, but found out he's not fit in well, so decided to return it to BabyAge, never got through. The customer service really sucks!"
133265,2,"After several increasingly painful weeks, we called Medela and were told that the kit is designed with different sized flanges. For $45, Medela should pack all $.10 of extra flanges so you can pick the right size that works for you. We were ignorant as to the sizing options (not for lack of attending classes or researching pumping) but just that *no one* ever talked about having different size flanges. There's not even any indication on the box. You will have to find someone to ""fit"" you if end up getting abrasions on the nipple or (due to inadequate suction from poor sizing) a clogged duct."
36605,0,"this was such a good sponge. soft, extremely absorbent but it lasted about two months and was in pieces. so maybe i didnt do all the special care etc e.g. soak in baking soda every now and then etc but even then, two months is a pretty short time for a ten dollar sponge."
56069,0,I never really used this and had to return because it wouldn't fit at the top of my stairs - the handrail made it impossible according to my carpenter. So it might work great for people with a different configuration BUT my low score is more based on the instructions which thoroughly frustrated and confused the carpenter - so make sure you have lots of time before you start trying to put this up
27925,1,"Sturdy, easy to use, clean and the kids love it. My sons is almost 2 years old and looks brand new!"
90988,1,great deal for the price!! I can't believe how much cheaper it is online than in the stores... at least $10!
184159,0,"Unless you have the time to make the food and put it into these containers, then by all means, purchase it."
167289,1,"We've been using this carseat since my son was 6 months old and it worked wonderfully as a rearfacing seat. Once he turned a year we had it installed forward facing and it's still great. He's comfortable in it and I love that it has velcro to hold the straps open while putting him in the seat - that way he doesn't sit on them. Britax also mentions that their straps won't twist, and this is true. Overall the seat is easy to buckle and I feel very good that my son is protected in a Britax Marathon."
55687,1,I have a newborn baby boy and he is relentless when he is hungry. I was stuck warming up my breastmilk by leaving in hott water and it took *forever* to say the least. When I found this online it was like a godsent and I couldnt wait for it to arrive. My little man has been much happier not having to wait as long for his bottle and mommy has been alot happier not having to swirl the bottle in hot water for 15 minutes.
98397,0,"I ordered this for my 7 month old son. It's a great idea and definitely keeps him protected. It does float on top of the water though, so it's like a little boat. It will glide across the top of the water so it's definitely not very sturdy. As long as your child stays sitting down its fine though. If they are moving around it definitely wobbles all over. You need to keep a watchful eye, as you should anyways with kids in water. The thing I really dislike though is the smell!! I hang it up to let it drip dry immediately after every use, but it still has this awful skunk order. It stinks up the whole bathroom!"
109546,2,"I like the idea of the product and their competitor has one thats better because the mesh part is disposable in the other one. Thats the only problem with this one. You can wash it in the dishwasher or by hand, but its still a little unclean and unsanitary. Otherwise its so great for feeding baby and he can hold it very well, but being a mom of 5, I have tried everything and the one with the disposable mesh is alot better"
138903,1,"Hello ,this is a great gift for children or adults. I actually got this formyself , because sometimes ill admit it i even still hate the dark. So i got this and it is so perfect. The stars show up so nice . I love the color functions , the amber is nice and gold shows upwell and blue is so tranquill >I wish i had this when i was little.But i have it now .Peace"
65427,1,"My 8 month old daughter has eczema, especially on her tummy and arms. We use creams such as cetaphil, gentle naturals, aveeno, eucerin, etc...which work, but I found this mustela dermo-pediatrics with stelatopia to be the most beneficial. After a few uses, I noticed her skin is softer, and less red/patchy. The cream is thick and unscented and seems to stay on her after I apply it. I use it 2x a day and am very happy with the product. I highly recommend it if your baby has eczema (atopic dermatitis) or very dry skin, especially in the winter."
41087,1,"We received samples for several types of diapers when our daughter was born but Pampers has always worked the best. With other diapers we had problems with leaks and the diaper moving a lot, but we have never had any issues with the Pampers products. They are the best."
36835,0,"My mother said that I didn't need a breastfeeding pillow. I read some blogs saying that you can just use any old pillow you have lying around if needed (which I suppose is true). I ended up registering for a Boppy Pillow (approximately $35) anyway. One, everyone else was doing it. :) Two, it can also be used as an ""infant support pillow.""One note before I give you my account on breastfeeding pillows. Something I didn't take in account was that I would have a difficult time due to the fact that I was already very heavy chested (36H). Trying to maneuver a baby under my breasts and see what I was doing (let alone if the latch was good) turned out to be quite the challenge.Well I got the Boppy Pillow and I kind of struggled to use it. I was always readjusting it and finding myself hunching over my little one (which is killer on my back). However, my baby (which is 9 weeks old at the time of writing this) loves lounging in this pillow. The Boppy Pillow comes with a little booklet showing you different uses. I do not regret this purchase, but it just didn't work for me when it came to helping me with breastfeeding.My mother, after seeing me struggle with my large-chestedness, actually got me another breastfeeding pillow. This one I loved. It isMy Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green(approximately $40). It was kind of weird to strap a pillow onto me (I felt like one of those burlesque cigarette girls), but it really helps with keeping the pillow in place. The biggest plus was that it made me essentially handsfree. I could now reposition my breast or baby and see exactly what was happening. An added feature is the back support - it's heavenly."
40484,1,I love pamper cruiser. I got my order shipped fast. Very good!
113089,0,This toy is just not that interesting to my 4 month old. It seems overpriced for being just a piece of cloth with a wooden ring. Maybe he will like it more as he gets older.... It is awfully cute though.
70686,1,"Very good product. If you have little child, this is a fantastic chair that will help you a lot and your little child too, obviously!"
97715,1,"This is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there. The colors are fabulous, the material is soft and nice, and I was SO pleased by its overall quality. We also purchased some of the extras, (the lamp, pillow, and wall hangings) and were just as pleased. I would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that doesn't wish to know the gender before it's born, but also any parent that does know, be assured, it is great for a girl or boy, especially if you like animals!!"
109548,0,"I got these for my picky 10-month old who has not taken well to solids. They didn't really help matters. She was sort of interested in them, but more for chewing/teething than tasting. Within a couple weeks, she started eating finger foods, so these were basically rendered useless.I think these are probably best for 4-6 month old babies who are just starting on solids. I wish that I'd tried them earlier to get her used to tastes, but honestly, they probably aren't even that useful at all for most babies.Cute idea, but you could bypass this step and your baby won't miss it."
69715,0,"This is nice, but very thin and if I knew how to sew, I could have done it myself. It looks nice hanging, but we had to put room darkening blinds because it is so thin. Probably would not order again for the price."
51672,2,"I have never written a review on anything in my life but I am so frustrated and unhappy with this highchair, I had to warn others to please save your money. As a mother of 13-month year old twins, I have TWO of these highchairs to clean three times a day. THREE TIMES A DAY, I have the privilege of trying to undo all the food particles caught in numerous straps, crevices, and every other inch of these highchairs. I wish that I had registered for a cheap, plastic, simple highchair that wasn't so ""high-maintenance"". Everytime I clean the highchairs, I end up frustrated and upset. Can you tell we just had dinner??? Please save your money. Things that are more expensive, are not always better. I've learned that the hard way."
25229,2,I could not use these because my Arm's Reach co-sleeper was an older model and these were not compatible. I called the company and their only solution was to suggest I build a platform.
99322,0,"I thought the product will be useful for overnight. My kid sleeps from 10PM to 6AM. Swaddlers use to be much drier than this one!Definitely better than Huggies and Kirkland.Now I am using this one during daytime, so that I can change every 3 hours, and using swaddlers for 6 - hours."
58723,1,"This product comes in very handy. We use it every day &amp; can't imagine having to sterilize bottles the old fashioned way. Things have been invented for a reason; modern technology is a God send! We found that as long as you have more than (4)4 oz. bottles (for the early stages when baby eats about every 2 hours) or (2)9 oz. bottles (for the baby who is eating more at each sitting) there really is no inconvenience at all. You always have sterilized bottles on hand, while the microwave is running.It also works wonders on pacifiers that find their way on the floor or in rare instances another childs mouth at day care. I am anxiety free because I know my son's bottles &amp; paci's are well sterilized &amp; safe for him to put into his mouth."
81526,2,"After having success with an older ""First Years"" monitor, we were in need of a new one. Without doing my homework I immediately went and bought this ""upgraded"" First Years model. What a mistake. We cannot use it anymore since all we hear is annoying ""flicking"" static on one channel, and the second channel picks up the noise in my neighbors house. I spoke to a company representative who suggested that I ask my neighbor to move her monitor further away from my home!! Otherwise, that I should go buy another monitor that is a higher or lower mghz. If this complaint is so common, the company should explore ways to correct. I couldn't be more dissatisfied."
17663,1,"I love this stroller!We have been able to use it for our son since he was a few months old. It reclines so that makes it easy for an infant to ride in it.I also like that is it light weight and fits in the trunk of our convertible with plenty of room left. It also has a storage basket which actually holds quite a bit. I can fit my small diaper bag, a few toys, kids shoes, sippy cups, water bottles. You can also hang stuff on the handles when the child is in the seat and it does not tip over.I also like the 5 pt harness it has adjustable straps and my son is 1 year now and has not tried to take them apart (unlike his high chair). It can be a little rough on concrete but does great for smooth sidewalks and indoor use. Also, the handles are high enough for my husband who is 6'5"". My kids seems to like this chair if he gets fussy because he is tired we just recline the seat and he takes a nap. The stroller is like new and we have had it for over a year. Overall, I would recommend this stroller!"
29287,0,"This stool is very nice looking and good quality, but it is extremely short and small (even for my 2 yr old). I purchased this so he could reach the faucet easier to wash his hands and brush his teeth, but he still can't reach. I decided to keep it for when he gets a little taller."
84013,1,"I love this toy box....it is a perfect addition for our 2 1/2 year old bedroom. It holds all her plush toys. It is not huge, but it is not too small...it is just perfect size. I love everything about it....so soft, the top stays in place whenever my daughter lifts up and does not shut on her fingers.....even if she decides to hide inside, the top does not lock by itself (never locks) and she still has air coming in...that was one of my worries in buying a toy box. This is perfect!"
150837,2,"We bought a crib from stork craft and it looks good and was not too hard to set up so we thought it would be the same with the dresser....WRONG!! Do not buy this, it does not fit together correctly. The drawers woudlnt even all go in. After drilling new holes to make it actually function there are spaces inbetween the drawers and it just looks bad."
73416,1,"After reading the reviews, I convinced my wife (and myself) that the itzbeen would be something extremely helpful in keeping track of all the baby functions associated with a newborn. What I didn't realize was just HOW useful and helpful it would be. The timer functions are great at keeping track of lapsed time since feeding, changing, and sleeping. Additionally, there's another ""misc"" button that can also be used. My wife and I have been using that to keep track of lapsed time since pain medications.It takes a little bit of discipline to initially use the itzbeen, but once you make it a habit, it becomes very routine. The hardest function to ""track"" would be the sleep function - namely because our newborn has a tendency to doze off during feeding times, and often re-awakens once we put her back down in her crib.The one ""drawback"" to the itzbeen is that parents hoping to see a trend in sleeping schedule, feedings, etc. My wife and I have printed out supplemental log sheets to keep track of our baby's sleeping trends throughout the first couple of months.For all expecting parents (or recent parents), I would definitely recommend this product!"
89233,2,Left my baby with a diaper rash after 2 days of use. I didn't suspect it was from the diapers at first until a couple weeks later I went to finish using up the package and her rash appeared again. I'll never use pampers again.
146963,0,"I originally purchased one set at the not-so-low price of just over $59.00. After the product had some time to ""air out"" (yes, it has an odor), we were quite satisfied with it. Does what it is supposed to do - give our 10 month old a bit of cushion for the minor spills he is taking while trying to figure out how to pull up, sit down, and take those first steps.I just came back to purchase another set as the one we have is not quite large enough to cover the entire space inside our wooden corral, and wow...Amazon has now decided that if I want these, I'm going to pay $20 more for the exact same thing.Guess I'll figure out how to go without, because although I can afford the extra $20, the thought of paying 30% more for the second set just because Amazon randomly decided to go up on the price is something I cannot stomach."
67592,1,"We love our new high chair!The restraints were the major selling point as we have an extra wiggly little one. But, once we got it home and set up on the hardwood floors we found that it is quite fun as well! My son loves being spun around in it before dinner time :) This one will last thru 2 kids for sure. Plus, it's cute..."
168306,1,great time and money saver to have diapers automatically arrive at my door as scheduled...especially as a mom of twins. lowest price on diapers that i have found.
43085,1,"This was given to me used from a cousin, and it has been the only stroller I've used with my Graco carseat for my 5 month old son. I am so thrilled with it! It is so light, easy to fold and setup, and can go anywhere with us. It's such a breeze to snap the carseat in and out, too. I removed the cupholders and the net bag on the bottom, since they were unnecessary for me. THe wheels are still in great condition. The steering has bcome a little stiff, but i think if i put a little grease on them, it should be just fine.I have no intention of looking for another stroller for now. This is perfect for us!"
139625,1,"It is a very good product, it seems solid and long lasting.The colors and stars are really soothing, I almost just want to keep it for myself and get another one for my baby."
9694,1,"This potty chair is great! My son is a big kid at 2, and the other chairs I purchased were way too small for him to get his whole behind on. Plus, this seat is oval so it gives him plenty of room for his ""baby boy parts"" without scraping or squishing him, and plenty of room to keep the potty from splashing out. He has never complained about sitting on this chair, and will sit there for ages while we wait! A great product!"
167390,1,"These bags are the only ones I have used. They are quite easy to use because the zipper seal allows you to keep the bag open and transfer milk into them. They stand up well, seal tightly and do not leak. They are also the least expensive I have found. I often pump right into them (medela pump) without any difficulty if I run out of bottles at work - just have to hold the bags at the zipper firmly to the neck of the flange. I mainly use these to freeze milk. They are a little inaccurate in measurement (+1/2 ounce) - seems they state more milk is in the bag than there really is. They do leak a little when used as drop in liners due to how thick the plastic is. Over all, this is a good product."
141482,1,I love everything about this...The fact that before they are standing up you can pull that front off and put on the floor for them to play and then put it back on for when they are starting to stand/walk....Big downfall if they aren't ready to walk yet and are a little tipsy don't let them use it does wobble with your kids.
132290,0,"This shade is gorgeous, we have the JoJo Designs Oriental Garden. The problem is that we have been to Target, Walmart, Lowes, Kohl's and a few other random stores and still cannot find a lamp base that fits this shade. Right now it is an odd table decoration since we don't know what to do with it."
44987,0,"Our little guy likes this ok, but I wished that it provided a little more stimulation. The music cuts off after just a few moments and the toys don't really do much. The only other one i've tried is the similarly priced Rainforest and I think that it is a little better."
134308,0,"While my son loves the fact that the wipes are warm when I use them, the stupid lid to the warmer won't stay shut. It is constantly drying out the wipes that are in there and I have to constantly go back and shut the lid. I've even tried putting something on top of the warmer, but that just makes it more difficult for me when I go to change a diaper. I would recommend this warmer if you have plenty of extra time throughout your day to make sure the dang lid stays shut! Also, if you have a money tree you can go pick money off of to replace all the dried up wipes then this is the product for you. Yes, I have been replacing the replacement pillow so it isn't that. Just frustrates me to spend so much money on something that doesn't work properly."
120845,1,"Love the automatic closure and the ability to open the swinging door either direction. Very solidly built, and it door clicks with a nice thud like in a luxury car. I installed it on top of the stairs, with the ends screwed into the walls. The gate is very, very secure. I tried to give it a pretty hefty shove and pull, and it wouldn't budge. Highly recommended. Great quality for the price."
157969,1,I just had to write in and give praise to this product- It has saved my husband and I so many sleepless nights! We first had our daughter in a bassinet(without the monitor)with us in our room but I found that I was constantly checking on her to make sure that she was still breathing-Yes I am a new mommy but none the less when we put her in her crib an used the monitor it was AMAZING! The peace of mind that it gave me hearing every movement she made with a reassuring tick to let me know that she was still breathing.I have never had any false alarms with this monitor like some have had I believe that if you follow the directions you won't have any problems.As for the parental unit making a noise - just make sure you turn the main monitor off before picking up your child- it's not hard.We have had no problems with this unit- Trust me it is well worth the money!
75085,1,"I just got this bag today. I have transferred all the items from my Coach diaper bag into this one with plenty of room to spare. I have an 11 month old and another on the way due in August. I had to use two bags previously to fit a change of clothes, three diapers, small case of wipes, some food and a couple of small toys. This bag is the perfect size. I dont find it to be floppy but that could be due to the fact that it hasn't been ""worn in"" yet.My one ""complaint"" is that I ordered the Power Pink and the description said it came with MATCHING PINK accessories. Mine did not. I got a pink bag, a brown changing pad, and a blue bottle warmer and zippered pouch. not sure if that was an error or if it was supposed to come that way..."
38347,2,"Friend recommended this bather. I used plastic tub first 3 months, when baby outgrew it I gave this cushion a try. I have a double kitchen sink; cushion took up too much room so I've been using it in the bathtub. I'd rinse it and hang it to dry and it would still be wet the next night. It's been 3 months now and mildew is starting to form. I also didn't like the way baby layed down flat during bath. I am going to buy a toddler tub asap."
45397,1,"My sister gave us this toy. My son is 4 months old. He stays so content with this activity mat. I love that there are additional holes to switch different toys using links. He loves to lay on his stomach at look at the flowers that light up. This product washes wonderful. I wash it at least twice a week and it has really held up(let air dry). I can't believe how fast his fine motor skills have developed by using this mat. Of course he loves the mirror as all babies do. This is a must have for every baby, helps parents too! This is a life saver when you are at home by yourself. I know he is safe if you have to run in the other room for a moment. The toys that come with it keep my son so occupied. He bats at them or pulls at them. He is very strong so I can tell you that he loves to pull on the giraffe's legs. It is made very well. We have bought and received many toys but this one is the best ever!"
121035,2,"I bought these diapers for my 2 month old after reading great reviews. The infant size is listed for 10-22 pounds, which is quite a range in weight. My daughter currently weighs 13 pounds and these diapers are just enormous on her. I pulled them up as high as they would go (nearly to her armpits) and the leg holes were still gaping around her thighs.I do think these will be fabulous once she is a little bigger."
54240,2,"This was a great toy, until the motor died 5 weeks after I opened the box. Unfortunately, my daughter loves it so much, I may buy a replacement one, all the same. If you can stay away from this unit upfront, do so. I am going to try and get the manufacturer to replace the unit..."
49200,1,"I absolutely love this product. Love it so much, I intend to buy a second one to make her play area larger."
126276,2,"I purchased these Huggies diapers to see how they compare to Pampers, and I must say, that I prefer Pampers. They are much softer and better absorbing."
153612,1,"Very pleased with my purchase. I think they can compliment just about any little girl's room with the variety of colors, which is why I finally chose this pattern. :)"
98925,0,"My son is very active and notorious when it comes to peeing. This diaper does not hold as much as the swaddlers does. It also sags a lot. Total waste of money! We switch toCruisers and its way better he can swirm, run, jump and no leaks even when he poop. I recommend Pampers cruisers for a very active boy."
120542,1,"Let me start off by saying, works flawlessly for my 4 pound 3 ounce son. What peace of mind it has given my wife and I, we can sleep. This monitor runs off a 46/49 mhz signal which is far less crowded these days due to everyone having all the long range 900 mhz cordless phones and 2.4 ghz cordless phone, 2.4 ghz wireless computer routers, and even microwaves ovens. It isn&#65533;t a crystal clear quiet monitor, but it has less static then some of the other 900 mhz straight baby monitors I&#65533;ve tried.Story: My wife and I are on our second preemie child, the first was ten years ago when our daughter was born at 1 pound 11 ounces; she came home after 82 days at 5 pounds 2 ounces on a bradycardia and apnea monitor and caffeine. Our son was born at 3 pounds 2 ounces and he had done so well in the hospital from day one that the doctors told us that he would be going home soon, without any monitoring system. My wife and I got filled with a lot of anxiety. When you sit in the hospital for weeks and months day and night with constant hospital bradycardia (low/no heart rate) and apnea (low/no breathing) monitoring you get quite co-dependant on it.My wife had seen this device advertised in a baby magazine and asked me what I had thought about its monitoring capabilities. I looked it up here on the Web and read all the reviews like you are doing now and was convinced that it was at least worth the [money] for a little peace of mind and we needed a baby monitor anyway. We ended up buying it at Babies-R-Us just on the fact that if it didn&#65533;t work the way we hoped we knew they wouldn&#65533;t give us any run around with returning it for a refund. I was very skeptical about it&#65533;s sensitivity, well we bought it before our son was released from the hospital, and I set it up in the crib between a piece of plywood and the baby mattress. I tested it out by just barely touching the mattress to mimic a very short shallow baby breath and it would detect it. &#65533;Amazing!!!&#65533; I thought. I could not wait to see how it would work for the baby.Well, after a $90,000 hospital stay in the NICU he finally came home after being in the hospital for just over 28 days at 4 pounds 3 ounces, and the hospital did send him home on a bradycardia and apnea monitor, the company &#65533;Healthdyne Technologies&#65533; that leases these hospital grade bradycardia and apnea machines told me that they can be rented for $250.00 per month by anyone if insurance wouldn&#65533;t cover it. This machine attaches underneath your child clothes around a foam belt that raps around that chest area, this is really the only way of truly preventing SIDS, because SIDS can occur in a crib, bassinet, car seat, baby swing, day care center, babysitters etc, but isn&#65533;t even 100% successful if there isn&#65533;t anyone around to HEAR the alarm and RESPOND to &#65533;Rescue&#65533; the infant.We had our son sleeping in bassinet when he first came home with the BeBe monitor working and hospital grade monitor. I was amazed how the BEBE monitor was half a second behind the bradycardia and apnea monitor. I figure it was probably in the lower grade receiving circuitry in the BeBe monitor. It would detect all but the most shallow of breaths, and even then it would only miss one out a 30, it had no false alarms. Our son would have pauses in breathing that would show up on the bradycardia and apnea monitor that would last 5-7 seconds and the TIC on the BeBe monitor would be silent too so I knew it was working perfectly too. Both the hospital grade monitor and the BeBe Monitor are set at a 20 second apnea delay and then would give loud alarms which would wake the child back into breathing again and alarm the parents to &#65533;rescue&#65533; the infant if still needed.Definitely gives us peace of mind knowing when the hospital monitor returns it a few week, we&#65533;ll still have some apnea protection while we are all sleeping.So as the warning label on the BeBe Angelcare-Monitor states: &#65533;This machine will not prevent SIDS.&#65533; Just remember, if you can&#65533;t respond to the alarm and &#65533;Rescue&#65533; your baby, SIDS will not be prevented. 62 out 100,000 babies born die of SIDS yearly in the USA. That&#65533;s 2000 infants die each year in the US. Mostly were preventable. 1 out of 5 die in day care centers. Remember to always have your baby sleep on his/her back. And have the mattress slightly elevated at 30 degrees to prevent any reflux disorder from feedings.Do not over dress, or over cover your child with blankets, over heating is also thought to be a cause of SIDS. Dress/cover them no more then what you would dress/cover yourself.Best [money] you can spend for your little one. That&#65533;s my two cents. ..."
124952,0,I was looking for a bouncy for my 7 month old and he really loves it but my main concern was the safety of the bouncer. The picture depicts a baby sitting in properly but when I place my son in he looks awkward sitting in it. It's like he's ready to topple over. No matter how much i re positioned him it just didn't feel comfortable.
170147,1,Just bought it. It was easy to assemble. It looks like it has good quality. Time will show whether it is built to last.
64156,1,my son couldnt care less about this teether. he likes the giraffe one much better....so lesson learned. He uses it more to throw at things than to chew on. If you buy this it could go either way.
61485,2,"We bought this monitor and could only hear the louder sounds our daughter made over a droning buzz that varied in volume depending on where we set down the receiver. The instruction manual listed the company's product support number, so we called. A very helpful operator immediately asked if we had wireless Internet. We told her we did and she said that was likely the problemIn order to get a clear signal with the wireless router running, we would have to purchase a >900 MHz digital monitor. As we spend a lot of time near our computers, we opted to return the unit and get another one."
103231,1,I was looking for a changing table that was sturdy and wouldn't break the bank. This was easy to put together and very sturdy for my squirmy 11 month old boy. It comes with a changing pad (thin - but it serves it's purpose). They don't spend much time there anyway. I don't like that the screws show on the outside of the unit so I might paint them. Good product for the price.
81471,2,The bib broke within a few weeks of receiving it. The plastic strap that is used to hold the bib closed snapped off during normal use.
85521,1,"I am highly impressed so far with these decals! I was kind of worried there would be issues sticking to the wall, since they are folded in package--but no issues! They are very cute and there's a very generous amount of stickers to decorate with--perfect size-not too small and not too big. I highly recommend these for any Thomas fans out there! (Cannot wait to surprise my son with his new Thomas wall invasion! Will post pics too~"
358,1,"For the price, these diapers are great! My little one used to go through diapers like they were water. I initially put her in Pampers Cruisers, but when you used 20+ diapers a day it starts to get really expensive--these were a cheaper alternative. The quality isn't a high as Cruisers, but still a great diaper. We rarely get leaks, and when we do I know it's time to bump her up a size. The Amazon Mom program really helps make these more affordable than the store generic brand."
45613,0,It is not as great as everyone is making it out to be. The hanging toys bang the baby in the face when he hits them. They hang to low. Only one part of the mat lights up. Doesn't do enough for $60.
162561,2,"I have to say that I really thought this would be a great tub while my son was really tiny and the fact that it folds up compactly meant that it wouldn't be in the way all the time. WRONG! My son and I both hated the tub. It was hard to rinse the back of his head and forget about trying to wash his backside without a fight! Also, he slipped around in it. I would roll up hand towels and put them on both sides to keep him from slipping. For a long time, I thought he hated baths, not true. Once I started realizing that this tub was really difficult to use, no matter what I tried, I started bathing with my son and he loved it. We continued this until he could sit in a bath ring.The bottom line - Safety 1st should be ashamed to have their name on this product."
92172,1,"Bought this for my niece's 3 month birthday, just precious! Looks beautiful in her nursery. Great gift for a baby girls room-would for sure buy again, and reccommend to a friend!"
83913,1,"The TinyDiner is the greatest way to keep my baby's food off the germy table tops in restaurants. It is easy to carry along because it rolls up small and stows away in the diaper bag, then it unrolls whenever you need a clean area for baby to eat from. We have no problems keeping it in place-- the suction cups really do work, and my baby can't pull it up even if he tries. We get lots of questions whenever we eat out with the TinyDiner-- everybody can see how well it works and they want to know where they can buy it!"
131934,1,"I have 3 month old twin girls and they simply love this swing!!!! I love it because it's so convenient and doesn't take up so much space in our home. I like to put the swing on the highest setting when they're being fussy and it instantly puts them to sleep. This is a good investment I purchased two for less than the price of a standard swing. I always get a lot of compliments on them when we have visitors over , everyone says how different and convenient it is and how they wish something like this was around years ago. This is most definitely a good buy!!!"
36267,0,"This turned out to be a nice gift but not as nice as the item pictured on the website. The item I received did not have a hinged top, only a slide-out plexi-glass top (undamaged). Also, the tube was engraved with cartoony flowers and other items with the words &quot;Birth Certificate&quot; smaller on the side, not at all as elegant as the picture makes it look. It makes a nice gift as long as the buyer knows what he is getting!"
171375,1,This is a fantastic tub. The hammock takes so much worry out of bathing a newborn. Both the hammock and the tub accommodated our off-the-charts son well into his first year. I don't know how our parents ever managed without it.
37755,1,"Between prime shipping and the savings in the grocery section, this is a great value for wipes. We don't have children yet, but we use it to clean up our puppy and ourselves, works well."
95602,1,It's much bigger than I expected and stretches a lot. Holds a ton of stuffed animals and can't beat the price.
138969,1,"My 4 year old daughter loves her pink ladybug. It makes her look forward to going to sleep in her own bed and since we got it, I havent had any midnight visits from her climbing into my bed. She loves to show it off to everyone who comes over."
152138,1,"The set itself is super cute. I saw it at Babies R Us for about the same price as here, but was determined to find it cheaper. I did at Sears.com. Now the set I bought is only a 4 piece instead of 6 piece. It includes the bumper, crib dust ruffle, fitted sheet & quilt. It does NOT include the valance or the diaper stacker. I paid $79 plus $5 for shipping and a few dollars for tax. That's a difference of $100, if you really want the valance and/or diaper bag they are sold separately on Amazon, and you will still pay less then the price here. So its a great set, but make sure you shop around!"
40413,1,"They're diapers. They've always worked like a dream. Very rarely have I ever had an issue with blowouts. But then, there's only so much solid waste a diaper can hold. If your munchkin produces more than that...blowout. I've never had urine leak from these. I tried getting the cheaper ""big-box"" diapers but a percentage of those were unusable due to manufacturing defects. These are more expensive, but every one is usable. They are the perfect diaper for my little sprog."
111550,1,"After leaving my Lansinoh pump at work over a five-day weekend, I had to buy the Medela Harmony as a replacement. I was so happy to get my Lansinoh back! Hopefully this review might help people who are deciding between the two. As background, I work two days a week and pump three times a day on those days. On all other days, I pump once overnight. For my needs I am glad I didn't shell out for an electric pump. While there are a few minor things that are better about both pumps, the bottom line is that the Lansinoh works better. Both pumps are quiet. The Lansinoh, however, is simply a better fit and more efficient at pumping - and that's all I really care about! The padded breast shield is very comfortable (the Medela doesn't have one), and I have had very few problems with the suction. I am able to pump a full bottle in 10-15 minutes. With the Medela I was driving myself crazy because the suction was so finicky. Also Medela has a nifty feature that allows you to press on one end until let-down, then you pump using the main handle. Sounds good and clever, but really it's pointless. I never use that feature, and with the Lansinoh, it's so easy just to pump more quickly until you let-down. Assembly is extremely easy and it's possible to pump one-handed. Really my only minor complaints are that it's a little difficult to clean the very inside of the main flange (my bottle brush doesn't quite reach; the Medela is better designed in that way), and it's not as compact as the Medela (which fits inside a make-up bag). I love Lansinoh products including the breastmilk storage bags, breastpads, and bottles. By the way, the bottles are interchangeable between these two pumps."
16448,1,"We're actually using this on my mom, who is bedridden and in diapers. It's good for both prevention and treatment of diaper rash. We like its creamy texture, mild smell (which is not unpleasant at all), and the fact that it doesn't feel greasy on her skin. It's just sort of there.I've tried other, more expensive creams and ointments, but this works just as well and is quite reasonably priced.Although it seems kind of funny to be using baby diaper rash cream on an elderly parent, the cream doesn't know the difference! It works great even on old people."
173969,0,"I wish I had the ocean aquarium swing instead of this one. The colors are very boring. My son likes the birds and the mirror when he looks up, but otherwise it's not worth the money."
20649,1,My daycare mom has this and the kids have so much fun bouncing in it. Their faces are bright and they are laughing the whole time. What a lifesaver! I might put the exersaucer aside and get one of these for my house.
161802,2,"I do not recommend this tub. It looks like a great idea, but the tub is 2 pieces and it is very difficult for one person to get it snapped together correctly. If it's not snapped together just right, it leaks."
58506,1,You have to have this product. New moms know that time is precious. Everyone is amazed it only takes 4 minutes to sterilize everything from bottles to pacifiers. Well worth the $.
74379,0,"While this chair is definitely sturdy, I hate trying to clean it. I see that other reviewers say it's easy to clean, but I would have to disagree. Food constantly falls between the cracks around the seat, and gets stuck in all the little joints. I have to remember to clean under between and around the chair every time, or it gets disgusting. I'm currently looking for another chair for my daughter because I just can't take it anymore."
46119,2,"As an optometrist, the idea of this product is great. That's about it. The quality is quite poor. It doesn't fit on the arched side of our crib (nor the straight front/back end) which deems it almost useless. We ended up holding the cards up like flash cards. When no longer needed, it all went in storage. I recently took it out for my newborn #2 and the thin plastic parts that connect the cards to the main base were broken. Poor quality and doesn't fit with all cribs."
149611,1,"I purchased this mattress for Baby Mod's mini rocking crib. It's a teeny bit short lengthwise but fits snugly and securely width-wise. My babe sleeps soundly so I guess it's comfy! I read other reviews prior to purchasing and I didn't run into the same construction defects as others. Also, the depth really is 3 inches so if you think it's thicker, it's not. Overall- great price, insanely fast shipping, and, most importantly, baby sleeps soundly all night. I'm happy and recommend this product!"
35490,1,This product is honestly a lifesaver! I use it almost everyday and never worry about my daughter putting her mouth on any of the handles of the shopping carts anymore! Not a shopping trip goes buy that I am not asked where I bought my seat cover. If you saw the 60 minutes expose on how filthy shopping cart handles are you would know just how much you need this item. I will never go shopping without it again!
34275,2,We are returning this car seat travel bag. The zipper broke during the first leg of the trip. I just happened to be sitting by the wing of the plane watching them load luggage and saw our car seat sticking out of this bag with a broken zipper. Then I had to worry for the rest of the trip if the car seat would make it to the our final destination as we had a lay over and transfer. Not cool! FYI- The airline was unable or unwilling to alert the luggage carriers when I spoke to the customer service rep during the layover. This product was too expensive for this kind of stress!
62300,2,"This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child. Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended, nor tested with your safety seat, but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic & Safety Administration) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that ""after-market products"" should not be used. It also does not meet FMVSS213 standards as stated in the manufacturer's description."
66304,0,"This product is being bosted as a travel set but just like the other reviews state, you can't even fit all the utensils into the container. I had to take 2 out & still had trouble getting the lid on. Simple fix would be to just make the case a little bigger, I mean who at Nuby was able to make this work? I tried fitting them all in several different ways & none worked. Some have said they don't really need them all to fit but I bought this to use on vacation & it would be nice to be able to keep them all together so none get lost. I've not noticed problems with other Nuby products but this one is off for the purpose they are advertising it for."
52057,2,"Over the course of three children we have had FIVE carriers: Two slings, a Baby Bjorn, a Snugli and the Ergo Baby.The Bjorn is definitely the best looking and easiest to use. The clips and connectors are very intuitive and it's easy to get smaller infants into it.The ""Air"" version is identical to the ""Original"" but with much more breathable fabric. Unfortunately this doesn't address the biggest shortcoming of the carrier.My big complaint is that when the kids get larger (or if you wear it for more than ~10 minutes at a time) it really starts to kill your back. This is because the design keeps all the weight on your shoulders. It's like wearing a backpack BACKWARDS!The ""Active"" and ""Synergy"" versions have wider straps with a center buckle and a lower strap ""lumbar"" strap which provides additional support over the ""Original"" While this distributes the weight better, it doesn't put it on your hips. Oh, and it also makes it a lot more fiddly to put on.If you backpack, you know what I'm talking about. A lightweight pack is fine for lugging 10 lbs of books to class, but if you want to be able to hike for an hour with 25+ lbs you have to shift the weight to your hips.If you only plan to use this when grocery shopping and think you'll give it up when they're 6 months old, this might be for you. If you think you might want to go to the park and hang out, or use it even when the kid starts to crawl, then the Ergo Baby is probably more your speed. My wife can take our 25 lb 1 year old for 20 minute walks around the neighborhood in the Ergo Baby Carrier.p.s. this is coming from a guy who is 6', 180# and fit. My wife is smaller and far more critical of the ergonomics of this carrier.If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!"
134377,1,"We bought this based on reviews and we love it. It works perfectly for us and yes, we do use pampers wipes. The wipes are always wonderfully moist and warm. Our daughter doesn't mind having her face etc. wiped as long as the wipes come from this warmer. We highly recommend!"
176082,0,"The item is not sturdy. This is an expensive baby piece of furniture. It scratches MUCH TOO EASILY!In placing the book case unit over the dresser- it made a dent- and that was with VERY LITTLE movement or pressure. Then the Wood cracked where the screws were inserted- again with very little pressure. The pieces are good to look at- and look attractive. However, the pricing is quite high and not worth the workmanship quality."
180015,1,"I purchased this pump reluctantly to use occasionally at home during my maternity leave. I have been using it for three months now and I use it at least once or twice a day. It is easy to use and after some practice, can pump up to five ounces in 15-20 minutes. I highly reccommend this pump!!!"
141645,1,"Purchased it for my grandson,s first birthday. Less then a week later he was walking all by himself.The toy gave him the confidence he needed.He loves the music also."
54174,0,"I was very happy when I discovered this odd looking mobile engaged my daughters attention and she loved it. However, after 3 months of use, at the first battery change, the motor stopped working just like that. It didn't fall or anything. I keep using the musical part,but my 3 month old baby loses interest within minutes. I hope this problem is corrected; if so, I would definetely recommend it to other parents."
67078,1,My son-in-law must really like these sincehe always requests more. So I get them for himon every birthday and holiday.Jo
54414,0,"This mobile bought us lots of time to do stuff while our baby kicked and hooted at the characters, or simply watched them go 'round and 'round. The music sounded great, and it would have easily earned a 5-Star rating from me if not for two things: the moving parts in the blue ball section squeaked a lot, and the motor went kaput after about four months of normal use.To attest to its design and appearance, however, the mobile part (the plastic piece that twirls and holds the little animals) hangs by fishing wire over my girl's changing table. She's seven months old, and she's still mesmerized by this mobile's characters. I'd recommend it, especially over non-battery-operated mobiles, but keep a backup mobile and some WD-40 on hand!"
17985,1,"I love these in our daughter's room - we don't have the Gossamer wings set, just lots of pink gingham. But these are so cute, really dress up the nursery."
29229,0,"I purchased this with the matching potty seat for the toilet. I love the skid resistance top and bottom as well as how light weight the product is. My 21 month old picks it up to turn the light on and off in the bathroom and then he takes it back to the toilet. I do wish the item was a little taller or at least had the option of being taller. We started integrating the potty training process with my son at 16 months, he is now 21 months and still too short to sit on the toilet (even with the stool). The toilet in his bathroom is also a little shorter then a ""normal toilet"" (approx 16.5""). Since he prefers to use the toilet as opposed to the potty chair (BabyBjorn) he started out with we hoped this would be an easy way for him to sit on the seat by himself. Unfortunately he is too short, however he is able to step onto the stool when he is finished. The height of the stool is 6"", it would have been perfect at a height of 8"". We are just going to have to wait until he grows into it."
160213,1,"My son was 7 lbs and 19 1/2"" when he was born. I found this swaddler blanket to be a little short for him. He didn't mind having his legs swaddled traditionally but he needs access to his hands. When I tried swaddling just his lower half in this swaddler, he immediately attempted to kick out of it. He will allow his legs to be tightly wrapped otherwise. I don't know why he dislikes this swaddler so much.My daughter loved to be swaddled and I wishh I'd had this for her. My advice is to wait until after Baby comes, get to know to what degree s/he likes to be swaddled and, if so, buy it then.The fabric is super soft and it folds nicely for storage; the product isn't a problem. Like a previous review, I recommend the sleep sack instead. It allows more room for the kicky baby yet provides warmth and comfort for tiny babies."
41436,2,"Once my daughter started to walk I knew I had to change to a diaper that had a better fit since she was moving more. I decided to try the cruisers. They had a perfect fit, didn't leak and were a reasonable price. I never had a problem with them until recently. I noticed they put a new mesh lining. I thought, okay they are trying to make the product better, why not. Then I started to notice how the mesh lining would stick to my daughters behind. She has been constently pulling the back of her diaper. I tried to stick with it and keep using the cruiser but this week I noticed another difference. There are new tiny beads inside the diaper lining. I noticed that the beads were bunching up in certain areas and when barely wet it looks like she is wearing a heavy soiled diaper. Barely wet or not the mesh has also been leaving an impression all over. The mesh does nothing but stays wet!!! If it did the absorbing it wouldn't leave an impression on her. This diaper used to be the best but the new changes are bad, I wish that pampers would go back to the way it was! Now I have to go through the hassle of finding a better diaper."
121005,1,"No one else I know uses cloth diapers, and I had used disposables before, so this diaper has been a great transition for me. They work exactly like disposables, except you wash them instead of throwing them away. If you breastfeed exclusively, the diapers won't actually get ""stained,"" at least until you start on solid foods (we haven't yet). I'll get maybe one stained diaper out of a washload of ten, and that disappears if you hang it up in sunlight for a few hours, and I don't even pre-soak or pre-treat them. I thought the diaper pail would be really stinky. It's not... we keep it in our bedroom.Two caveats: The Ultras are superior to the Classic, and using a cloth liner with this diaper is a MUST if you don't want a leak or a blowout. I bought the Kushies cloth liners, but you can make your own if you have a sewing machine. All you do is sew a little rectangle of 2 pieces of absorbant fabric and finish the edges."
103318,1,"This gate was great at first. (In the previous review I had given it 5 stars and now can't get the star rating removed during the edit. It really should be one star or none.) We used it at the top of our basement stairs and loved it because it was very secure and there was no bar on the bottom of it to trip over like some designs.Well, while the gate itself is still very much intact and mounted in the doorway, the lock broke only after about 14 months of use. Their customer service is comepletely useless. I was told that that particular part wasn't covered. Only the rest of the gate. Huh?! And only after I continued to complain did they offer to maybe help me, but I had to show proof with my receipt that it was UNDER a year old! Well, it's over a year and I certainly didn't save the receipt! My husband tried to repair it, but rivets were used on the casing instead of screws, which i'm sure is on purpose so you can't take it apart. Hmmmm... I wonder if they think you'll buy a new one. $60 is a lot to pay for something that's built to fail. We still have it up and have attached a hook to it and the wall to keep it shut. My 2 year old can open it so there goes ""secure"", the only thing it does is keep the pets downstairs. DO NOT BUY THIS GATE."
108845,1,"Around 6 months my son developed a bad case of cradle cap. My doctor suggested using olive oil or baby oil during bath time and then combing out the flakes. I tried this for two weeks and saw no change, plus the oil made my sons hair greasy. I searched high and low and finally decided to take a gamble and spend the money on this shampoo. I am so glad I did. I used it for a week with theBean-B-Clean Baby Scalp Massaging Brush for Cradle Capand his cradle cap was significantly better. After a month it was gone. I left the shampoo on for a few minutes before using the brush to loosen the flakes. This small bottle has lasted us almost 6 months and it's still half full. We use it almost everyday. Not to mention it smells amazing and makes my sons hair oh so soft. It might seem expensive but it's well worth the cost."
96208,1,"This is by far the easiest way we have found to transport the car seat at the airport. It was easy to set up, left our hands free to carry other bags and keep our hands on two small children, made going through security and loading the airplane easier (even when airline didn't allow parents with small children to board first, arrgh!). We did not leave the straps in place when we used the seat on the flight as didn't seem to work for us, but it was still very easy to detach for the flight and reattach when we were deboarding. A huge plus is that it avoids having to unzip a bag or even take it off to board the plane. It is just some straps and buckles so it takes up very little space once it is detached and can be stowed easily. Would definitely recommend to any traveling parent(s)!"
159069,0,"There aren't many two room monitors on the market, so if you need one, this one is okay and by okay, I mean truly okay, at best. It goes out of range frequently, meaning you can't always get a signal to monitor either room, without even moving any of it's components. Also, the sound quality can be very poor, any noise you hear sounds like Darth Vader at times. Furthermore, you cannot purchase an additional receiver from anywhere, including the manufacturer. If I didn't have two children and if there were more options available, I wouldn't buy it."
23370,2,"I have had problems with this stinky pail since my grandson was born. It falls over, the lights don't come on, the fan has never run, the replacement filters are super expensive (to say nothing of the 4 D batteries I keep buying), its a pain to replace the bag and, worst of all......it smells to high heaven. I can now smell it when I enter the house. The final blow was when the plastic piece that pushed the diaper into the bag fell into the bag with all the diapers from the week and I had to fish it out. Gross!!"

157473,1,"Once the dresser was all put together, I thought it was very nice and brighten my daughter's room. The only compliant I have is there was not the safety attachment for the back of the dresser included in the box. I had read a previous review that had the same complaint, however, it may have been a different part. Just be sure to include all parts when shipping to customers. Otherwise, the finished product is really nice and worth the price, my daughter loves her new dresser."
29529,1,These cups are leak proof as long as you close them properly. I use them everyday and I think I had them for over a year now. They look like new. They wash well (I was by hand). I use a q-tip to wash inside the little plastic stopper and inside the spout.
89963,1,"I really love these baby dry diaprs. The huggies snug and fit gave my daughter a really bad rash. These have never been an issue regarding allergies/sensitivity and both my girls wear them. The only time I've had an issue with the leaks with my 2 and half year old daughter, not sure why. I've had no more than 2 leaks with my 10 month old. These are the best diapers we've ever come across"
89785,0,"I started my baby with the Pampers Swaddlers and was very happy, so as she grew, I purchased more Pampers. However, I have now made the move to Huggies. My little girl goes to the bathroom in large quantities and frequently. I found that the Pampers weren't as absorbent as the Huggies and didn't absorb fast enough. I also feel like the Huggies are made out of better quality materials. Less like a plastic pants. The Pampers are fine, better than Luvs, but I'm going to stick with Huggies for now."
12130,1,"Kept rolling away during the night. Comfortable when you can get it to stay into place, but difficult to control after falling asleep."
138571,1,My three year old was having trouble sleeping in a new room and bed. I bought this and that first night he fell asleep no problem and sleep through the night. If he wakes in the middle of the night he turns the turtle on and he goes back to sleep. Great product!
44144,1,"I really absolutely have no clue what this thing does or is meant to do.I mean, it spreads out water well and hangs pretty solidly on my faucet.but, it's not a bad piece of equipment, solidly built.Doesn't look too bad either.anyway, if this is what you're looking for, I recommend it. Boon is a good brand."
140861,1,"I was able to breastfeed my son until he was eleven months old, while working full time by using this pump. I used it with the One-Step Storage system, which made it easy for my husband to warm and give him his bottles while I was at work. The cups were super-comfortable, and after some practice, I had no trouble getting letdown. I could usually pump 4-6 oz per 15-20 minute session. I haven't noticed that it is any noiser than my friend's Medela. I haven't tried other electric pump, however, I did try an Avent ISIS manual pump and HATED it. This one was perfect for me."
76247,1,"I really like this product. We decided to make our own baby food for our twin girls. These trays make it so easy and quick. I really like being able to take out one ounce serves so we know how much our girls are getting. Best things: Store great, quick and easy. The cube can be tricky to get out sometimes, so I just run some water on the back of the try before I take off the lid to pop them out and they come out very easily..."
67153,2,"I bought this for my newborn twins and 1.5 year old. When the infant carriers are strapped in the 3rd seat (jump seat) does not work. Specifically, the seat closest to the handles leans back too far into the jump seat making it impossible for a child to sit back there. They would slouch forward. The stroller is also huge but i expected that. I wish it worked for us but it just didn't. My friend who also has 3 kids (11 mo twins and a 2 yr old) loves this stroller though. She doesn't use the carriers. I guess if you don't want to use the carriers the stroller might be your best bet. Without using infant carriers, this stroller is not conducive to newborns or small infants. I really need something now so I can get put of the house. I've searched high and low for an affordable, durable stroller for all 3 and I've found nothing. I'm just going to buy a double stroller and a triple wagon."
97774,2,"After our son was born, we experimented with several styles and brands of bottles to determine which were most compatible with him. Playtex VentAire's promise to reduce gas and fussiness sounded great...until I actually used them for a few days! I cannot think of anything positive about these bottles, and I agree with many of the points posted by other reviewers:*The bottles are a pain to assemble (especially when a new parent is sleep deprived), and easily susceptible to leaking.*They are a pain to wash (and the small pieces can get lost in the sink easily).*They are impossible to heat with a bottle warmer.*The 1st stage nipples release liquid far too slowly.*The 2nd stage nipples are FAR too fast.My biggest complaint about these bottles is that the nipples are designed to be VERY long and thin, and therefore have the potential to go deep into a newborn's mouth/throat, which caused my son to gag! I experienced a couple of instances where my son was incredibly eager to eat and would vigorously suck the bottle, took in too much nipple, and then gagged and vomited!We eventually decided that Avent's Naturally bottles were best suited for our needs: easy to assemble, easy to clean, and the nipples' ""natural"" design has a fat base so that it's impossible for a famished baby to suck the nipple in too far and gag."
142588,0,"I requested for and received this pillow at my babyshower. I tried it out for about 2 weeks with much dismay. The pillow only looks nice. It is rather hard and cumbersome to put around you, and it only works for nursing. You can't put baby to sleep on it. I highly recommend ""Le' Cuddler Infant Support Pillow"" instead--my baby loves that one. You can nurse baby on it and put him to sleep in it too. Check out my review for that one."
18123,0,"the star that is the centerpiece of the mat, is sideways. Call me crazy, but it bothers me that she is looking up at sideways smiley face instead of the correct way. There is no other way to adjust it unless I lay her sideways on the mat, then she won't have good access to the other hanging toys. Also, I would recommend this mat for babies 2 months and up as we tried to introduce it to her sooner and she had no interest.All in all, I am still a huge fan of Baby Einstein's bright colors and products that will stimulate my child's learning abilities."
120444,1,"After returning two other monitors .... I invested in this one. My son refuses to sleep on his back, so after countless nights of having him sleep on me I thought I would try this monitor out. It has been great!! It detects every breathe he takes and the sound quality is far better than the others I had. Now, at 7 weeks, he sleeps through the night and so do I!! We have had one false alarm because he scooted off the mat (which could be bigger!). When this happens it is the single most terrifying moment of your life but at least you know that the monitor works (after your heart comes back into your chest!) This monitor is definitly worth every penny."
120583,1,"This product is no longer available in my area. My 92 year old mother-in-law, who is is the rest home, requested it. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon and she is happy to have the fine talc that she remembers from her younger days. I bought some for myself and as gifts for friends. I am very pleased with it."
113178,1,"When I met with a lactation consultant, she recommended the 27 mm (large) breastshields and they do seem to be more comfortable. The biggest advantage to the ""personal fit"" shields vs the softfit is that they can be cleaned in the microsteam bags (for whatever reason, the softfit that comes with the pump can't be cleaned in the medela microsteam bags...stupid). The biggest disadvantage is that the shield isn't as soft/flexible as the standard shield that comes with the pump. The other disadvantage is the price ($12 for a piece of plastic - really??)."
43921,1,"We ordered this for our second car. The product arrived promptly, and works just fine with the Companion restraint."
103010,2,"I purchased this item 3 days ago and it is going back!! The overall quality of the seat is okay, but if you plan on using the tray it is awful!! I placed my 11 month old daughter in this and was unable to get the one side of the tray to fully latch. Well after I finally got this thing to fully latch guess what.......I couldn't get it to unlatch to get her out. The tray slides on and off REAL hard and the levers for the latch are small which make it hard to pull on them. I have an older model of the same chair which is probably 6 years old and love it, but the new and approved is WORTHLESS!! So back to the store this one will go and I will look for something different."
149290,1,"UPDATE: This pillow is an incredible MUST-HAVE! I bought it at 19 weeks pregnant and have been sleeping soundly ever since!It supports every part of my back, hips, belly, and legs! I had initially given it 4 stars because of the thread count, the color of the pillow case, and the length, but I absolutely believe none of that matters next to how soundly I've been sleeping!I'm 26 weeks pregnant now and can't believe that I have to fight with myself to get out of bed at this stage in my pregnancy. And the only reason I have to get up is to use the bathroom or to go to work...NOT because of unnecessary sleeplessness!This pillow is so comfy that I don't want to get up! It's true that I can't cuddle with my husband, but he's gotten used to it and actually LOVES it also! He cuddles up against it and absolutely loves how comfy it is. If you're thinking about it, just get it! You MUST HAVE this pillow if you're pregnant.I'm sure you'll LOVE it.INITIAL REVIEW:Before I bought this pillow I was starting to have some back and hip aches. I'm 19 weeks pregnant and expect the pain to have gotten worse if I didn't do something about it soon. Once I got the pillow in the mail, I slept on it and the very next day I felt incredible relief. Needless to say, I was in a better mood at work because of this. I LOVE THIS PILLOW! I have no more pain due to poor sleeping positions because this pillow supports every part of my body. I gave it 4 stars because the pillow case feels like it's 180 count so it's not the softest (I would recommend washing it and then using a fabric softener), the cover is white and gets dirty easily, and because the pillow isn't long enough. I'm 5'4"" and feel like I could use a little more length, so what I started to do is, depending on where I need the length, I'll pull on the one end so the other is shorter on one side to compensate. Either way, if you're pregnant and shopping for a pillow, consider this one your blessing from the skies. It has definitely helped me sleep better. I've only had the pillow one week, so I'll be updating my review at a later date as my pregnancy progresses and as I use it. As long as you have this pillow you'll have a good night!"
10493,0,"I like this tub because it folds up and is stored more easily than the larger tubs. However, when my son is sitting in the tub in our sink, sometimes the ends of the tub that are meant to fold will snap (and start to fold up) and the loud noise will startle him. It seems that the locks that hold the tub in the open position are not strong enough (if your baby is over 10 pounds, this is when this started for me).This tub also doesn't hold a lot of water, which starts to become a problem as your baby gets bigger."
49358,1,We use this for our deck - the opening is 8ft wide and the gate works great for keeping our daughter from running off the deck
81413,1,We bought this stroller to our hotel in New York and it rolled for 5 days early morning to late evening. Our toddler (9 months) had a great time at the street level in the stroller and we had good use for the large space under the stroller for our purchases during the days.We brought it home to Sweden and it is now a preferred choice for short walks over our more than ten times as expensive baby stroller.The only negative is the cup holders in combination with the rather stiff construction. Liquids will not stay in the cup for sure if rolling on anything else than a very smooth surface.To the price we paid it is certainly very good value for money.
26441,1,"I must say the bassinet looks just as good (if not better) in ""real life"" as it does in the picture. I have it all set up waiting for baby to arrive. I love the classy look of this bassinet (not too frilly and works for either sex) and it looks great in our bedroom. The onlt complaint I have so far is putting it together. For the most part, the directions are very helpful and things go together easily. However, when you get to the wheels, be prepared. The don't just ""snap in"" like they are suppossed to. We had to wrap a wash cloth around them and actually hammer the things in. But once you get it together, it's cutness makes you forget about those pain in the butt wheels! Hopefully baby will like it as much as mom does! :)"
22938,1,Nice box bigger than others i have seen.Well made with a fair price.I would recommend it to anyone.My daughter loves hers and I hear the tooth fairy was very impressed also !
110752,1,"We bought this 3 months after the baby was born. I absolutely wish we would have gotten him used to sleeping in this from the time he was born. I feel confident that he is safe while sleeping in the co sleeper. The directions were simple. You just need a bit of patience. I actually recommend this to all of my friends, especially if they are breast feeding. The 'mattress' is very firm, but not too firm. We will definitely be using this again if we have another baby!"
131815,1,"I was very happy w/ our Britax infant carrier and when my daughter outgrew it, I was a bit overwhelmed with all of the convertible seat options. I asked friends and fellow parents and they all said Britax is the best. I looked at online reviews and safety ratings and after having my daughter try out different seats from Britax and other manufacturers, the Britax Decathlon was the best choice for us. I love the head support and the convertible features. My mom bought one too so she could have it available for various grandchildren."
103519,1,"This is one of my favorite items! I love how it has lots of storage space inside. It holds all of her shampoos and washes (even the biggest sizes) and toys and rags....Everything! My husband loves how the seat can be adjusted to a more comfortable height when he gives the bath. It's so much better than squatting beside the tub. When a friend saw it, she bought it for herself. Her 3 year old uses it as a step stool to wash her hands and my friend uses it when she gives her baby a bath. My mom has a bad back and my mother-in-law has a bad knee but both of them have been able to give Avery a bath without pain. It seem very durable so I'm sure we'll get years of use out of it. This is a great item for anyone to have if they have children."
169509,1,"I have never reviewed a product before but I have been so happy with this bag I had to share! I have twins that I have to keep up with so I needed a bag that would allow for easy access, easy carry, and easy storage. This bag has exceeded all expectations. The bag doesn't get in the way when you carry it and it is big enough to get plenty of diapers, wipes, 2 cups, snacks, small toys, and other items needed for a trip out with 2 toddlers. I love how the compartments are set up so I can easily find what I need before the next meltdown! I have carried many bags over the last year and a half and I wish this was the first bag I bought! Even though I have girls, I am happy to carry this bag instead of the cuter girly bags I had before. My husband is now not ashamed to carry the diaper bag!"
51369,1,"I love,love,love these diapers! Oh, how I wish I would have tried them sooner. These were for child #4. This was my first time to try cloth diapers. I had been looking at buying these while I was pregnant, but was afraid they would be too much work. They are so much easier than I thought they would be. They are adorable to look at. They clean up so easily. No staining, no smell. I recommend washing every other day to keep from having problems with smells. Only problem is they might run a little small for really chunky legs. Can't think of an easier way to start cloth diapering."
50698,1,I recieved my pillow the very next day after I ordered it so next day shipping was great. This is my 5th child and all the other times I have just used standard body pillows this was my first time to invest in something like this. The pillow is very comfortable GREAT for couch naps. As for sleeping in the bed with hubby not so great for snuggling but gives support and comfort. If you get hot as most women do in the late 2nd early 3rd trimester it makes it worse but overall I would say its worth the investment. I dont know how versitile it will be after pregnancy for other uses but if you have back pain after it may be just the ticket. I hope this review helps make your decision with all the other more expensive models on the market I think it was a wise choice.
134782,1,We have hard wood floors and these knee pads work well. They stay on and they have an anti-skid material on the padding so there is no slidding.
9008,1,"I had to have this. I didn't think at the time that I could get more bang for my buck just by buying a regular cd player. The batteries die too quickly, the volume is too low and for the money, you can just do better. I purchased a bright, colorful cd player with a lot more features for a third less and I get lots more out of it. Spend your money better than this!"
25296,1,"The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I don't think the product secures well to the bottom of the seat.However, I am just pleased that my new leather seats won't be ruined."
152374,1,Great way for my 10 year old to keep her animals together. It fits many critters with room to spare and looks pulled together.
88385,1,"Did a lot of shopping around for a baby furniture set. Ordered this for the value and design. Was a little hesitant to order unassembled furniture through Amazon, but I'll tell you they exceeded my expectations. Not only was the furniture well packed for shipping...... I was really impressed by the real wood quality and ease of assembly! I ordered the crib, dresser and changing table to make the set. This is defiantly higher quality furniture and with my help, very well put together;)"
83609,2,"I bought this gate to put on my bed for nights when one of my kids (ages 3 and 1) crawled into bed with us. The assembly went fine and I didn't have any trouble securing it to the mattress. Within the first hour of my one year old sleeping next to the rail, she slammed her head against the not-padded metal pole that runs along the bottom of the bed rail. How can Safety 1st make a product that goes on top of a child's bed and not pad the metal pole??? My active sleepers would hit this rail every night. I had to line the bed rail with pillows to avoid future injury. In addition, we had the same trouble as many others when the plastic piece popped out of one of the legs when my husband tried to put the rail down to its unacceptably protruding down position and we were unable to get it back in without it popping right back out. This rail is going back to the store, even though we threw out the box."
150081,1,"We bought these trays for a 1000 mile trip with our two year old twins. It was the best thing for the trip! The kids were able to color easily. The raised side kept the crayons from rolling away. We ate meals on the road thanks to the tray. The material wiped up easily. The tray also allowed them to keep several toys in front of them at once. It was comfortable enough that the kids would nap with them still attached. One reviewer mentioned how the tray was a bit flimsy. I disagree. The tray is made from a stiff foam and held up fine. If it was a hard tray, it would become dangerous in an accident. Since it is foam, if there was an accident, it would collapse around the child instead of causing injury. One complaint I have, and it is very minor, is that no directions were included and no instruction was given about where to place the strap. The first time we used the trays, I placed the strap around the child thinking that would keep the tray closer to them. It made the tray sit unevenly and didn't work well. The strap should go behind the carseat. Having clips on both ends of the strap made it easy to remove the tray. This is also nice so you do not have to remove the strap from behind the carseat every time. I HIGHLY recommend this travel tray! Don't take a trip without it! Worth every penny! (We have Britax Boulevard carseats and it works great with them.)"
120577,1,Great transaction. Easy and very fast delivery. Thank you.
156468,1,"A perfect gift for the person who has everything, or a wonderful way to pamper yourself, Roberts Borotalco Powder is a heavenly-scented body powder. Use it daily instead of heavy perfumes if you like a clean, fresh scent - Roberts smells a bit like the talcum powder of long ago barber shops, that smooth, cool powder they patted on your neck after your haircut to smooth and cool your skin. Don't forget to sprinkle it on clean bedcloths, too, for a delicious, relaxing treat when you jump into bed at night. A new plastic container has replaced the attractively designed tin of previous years, but inside Roberts Borotalco is still the same refreshing pleasure you won't want to be without."
18413,0,"Breastfeeding and bottle feeding - We have been using these wide neck bottles from birth - figured the nipple would be better for him to adjust to but now that my son is 7 months old he likes to hold the bottle and feel the nipple when he drinks, but when he squeezes the nipple (or chews on it from teething) the formula comes up thru the straw-like vent and leaks out the sides. EXTREEMLY frustrating. Unfortunately we have a small &quot;investment&quot; in a bundle of these bottles, wish I could find a solution. I dont mind the extra pieces to wash, and the science of the bottle seems to be a great idea. At this point I wrap a towel around it and end up wasting most of the formula."
71956,0,"My husband and I debated long and hard between the Safe Seat and the Graco Snugride. We ended up picking the Safe Seat because of its versatility (it could handle babies 5-30 pounds rather than 5-22, and up to 32 inches long rather than 29), its safety (one comparison website said that the Safe Seat had Side Impact Protection and the Snugride didn't), and its reviews.However, if we had known what a headache it would be to get an extra base for the seat (to put in our other car, as has been recommended by friends and other reviewers), we would have gone with the Snugride.Amazon does not carry Safe Seat bases.We ordered a base through Toys R Us only to have them tell us (three weeks after we ordered) that our order was canceled because they were unable to complete it.Then we ordered a base through Comfortfirst, and found out shortly after our order that ""the product is currently on backorder.""Most recently, we ordered one through CountryLiving Store but the order hasn't shipped yet.Each time we've ordered a base, the company has said they had them in stock; and each time the base plus shipping has been expensive (over $50).It makes us wonder if Graco has discontinued making the Safe Seat and/or the bases for it, or if demand has outpaced supply."
58189,1,This was so easy to put together and it's absolutely adorable. The pictures on it are very well done and it's so sturdy even I can stand on it without any worries. My daughter can easily reach the faucet and soap and wash her own hands. It's perfect for our safari themed bathroom.
96840,0,"Once I figured out how to assemble the musical insert, this toy made for a great addition to my little boys' room. The noises/songs it plays are soothing and seem to help them get to sleep easier. My complaint is that the musical piece that goes inside the giraffe was next to impossible to figure out how to insert."
3500,0,"This has been a good seat for my son since he was 12 mos. He's now 4, 44 lbs & 43"" tall. The manual claims the seat can be used on a child &lt;52"" height, but my son has very little to go until the back of the seat meets the top of his ears, the limit according to the manufacturer as outlined in the instruction manual. I wonder what child at 52"" would properly fit in this seat if mine at 43"" has nearly outgrown it? Beware of this seat's claim to be the only one you'll ever need."
71654,0,"I have been through four different carriers and my daughter is only three months old. I just didn't want to spend big bucks for a Baby Bjorn. The hooks on the straps of the Infantino cut into my daughters face and was VERY difficult to unlatch and latch. I have pinched my fingers in the latches and broke many nails. The carrier also did not support my daughters head very well either. Also, when you turn your child around to face forward its very hard to latch and it doesn't fold completely down. It has good support on your back but not as good as the Baby Bjorn. I wished I would have not wasted so much time and gas and just bought the Baby Bjorn like everyone recommended. Now I finnaly have one and see what all the rave was about!! Its worth every penny!"
42790,0,"My husband and I bought this for our 3rd baby when she was 3 weeks old. She is very fussy during the day and doesn't like to be put down, but will sleep beautifully if she lays on my chest, so we figured this would be helpful to being able to get things done around the house without her screaming. When we got it home, my husband (who is an engineer and generally has no difficulty putting things together and following diagrams) attempted to help me put the Moby wrap on and then put our daughter in to it. She screamed and protested very loudly and wasn't in securely, as I tried leaning forward and she nearly fell out. After several more attempts, he recommended that we return it to the store. Later on, when she was calmer, I re-attempted this myself and did successfully get her positioned, but it was very awkward dealing with the ends, which basically hang on the floor until the very end while attempting the hold the baby in place while I wrapped myself. (I used the kangaroo hold for her.) I will say that she does sleep very well in it, but I do find myself holding her head while I move around with her, just because it doesn't seem very secure just tucked into a piece of cloth. On a positive note, I can keep up a little more easily with my older children having both hands free. Ultimately, I am hoping this gets easier with practice!"
80828,0,"I purchased these because they were cheaper than Pull-ups. The issue is that if your child isn't mostly potty trained, these are a huge pain. There is no Velcro on the sides so you have to take their pants, shoes, everything off to take the diaper off. Secondly, if they go #2, it's extremely difficult to get the easy up off without making a mess. From an absorbency perspective, I did not not much of a difference between these and other brands."
19633,2,"Not only do these not get very cold, but they don't even stay cold for 5 mins when you use them. I would not recommend these for cool relief. I haven't tried them for heat yet which is why I didn't give them 1 star"
155766,2,"Not very impressed. Buy a handheld one, more colorful and does just as much as this one."
33556,1,"I've been using this gate since April to block my spare room so my guide dog can't access the cats' litter boxes. It works perfectly to mount the gate about a foot or so off the ground for the old cat to get under, and the younger cats can get over it or under it.My roommate and I easily step over the gate, but we're tall enough, this technique might not work for everyone. The gate stays solidly in the door frame and even the cats can't knock it down when they jump over it. My guide dog is very well behaved and never tries to get in, but he's knocked into it a few times while playing and even his seventy pound body hasn't dislodged it.I gave the gate 4 stars because if I had small children, I'd be a little concerned that the pressure bar doesn't lay flush with the gate when closed tightly. I would worry about kids getting hurt, but for my purpose this isn't a problem. It might lay flush if locked in more loosely, but then I don't know how well it would stay in place.It was incredibly easy to fit into the door jam by feel. I have no sight at all and had no problems. When snapped tightly, the pressure mount stays in place.I would definitely recommend this gate. For the price, it's perfect. I don't know about kids, but it works great for keeping my labrador guide dog out of the room. Why tempt his good manners, right? ;)"
60346,1,"After tying 2 other tubs, this was the one we fell in love with. I had heard many good things about it, but my local Babies R Us store didn't carry it so we tried some other tubs and we were displeased with them. I finally called the manager at our Babies R Us and asked about the tub and he ordered some in and reserved on for me (saved me $21 in shipping). My son is now 3 1/2 mo and he's a big boy. He's so long that his legs would reach the end of the other tubs and he'd lock his knees and push against it and almost shoot himself out of the top! The EuroBath is plenty long and gives him lots of room to kick around and splash and he LOVES it! Bath time is much more fun for both of us now. And it really does allow for easier washing because this tub holds him in place well. It was money well spent!"
74690,2,they sent me the wrong item and I've been chasing them for 3 months and they wont give me my money back or even contact me to deal with what they've done

146675,1,"We bought this jumperoo for our daughter for Christmas. She's almost 6 mo. old and was starting to get bored with some of her other toys. This was a GREAT pick!!!--3 height settings are perfect for her long torso--made of good quality, safe materials--music settings are not too loud to be annoying--diameter is large enough to keep our two labs from completely being in the way as they are eye level with her in it--most importantly, she LOVES it!"
47008,1,"I had never used this brand before, but because of the raving reviews I decided to give it a try. I wanted something ""collective"" with more than one item in the set. The trial/travel size kit seems to be a waste since everything is so small. This set is perfect, everything in there is full sized, I was surprised by how much bigger the set is when it arrived than i imaged. So far i've used it for 3 days, the smell isn't for everyone but i love it.The only complain I have is the little goat, it's cute and all, but when my baby plays with it, all the fuzz starts to fall off. not a major thing but it would be nice if they make it a bit higher quality."
133417,1,Easy to clean and put together. Baby does not take in lots of air with these. Do not leak. Great bottles!

97707,1,"I purchased this to use as a changer/dresser combo for my second child. I also purchased the removable changer that attaches to the top of the dresser. The Chifferobe is smaller than I expected. I wish it were a little larger and more solid. There can be some small gaps between the side panels and the drawers due to the hardware used to hold it together. If I push firmly on the sides of the dreser, those gaps close up but I have noticed they reappear if the dresser is moved. The Chifferobe I purchased for my first child was much better quality, but it also cost an additional $200. For the price we paid, I am happy with this purchase. I was able to put the chifferobe together by myself, while in the third trimester of pregnancy. It took a while to get it together because there are a lot of pieces, but the instructions are good. The wood has a nice shine to it and the color matches perfectly with the DaVinci crib we also bought, though the crib is from a different collection."
37115,1,Easy to install. Pressure mounted so it doesn't ruin your wood work.Gate closes automatically behind you. It's safe to use at the top of the stairs. Nice sturdy quality.
58510,1,"This is the best baby shower gift I received. This is a no fuss, non time consuming way to sterilize baby's bottles. I have not placed the breast pump's parts in it because the manufacturer adviced against it. However, it is still a great item to have. I don't worry about whether the bottles and pacifiers are properly sterilized - I know they are - and I never get scalded. Word of caution - do wait the recommended 2 minutes before opening the sterilizer - you may be burned by the steam."
164485,2,"When DD was first born I used Pampers Sensitive and I absolutely loved it. I've tried Costco brand, Pampers, and Huggies. I thought I would go back to Pampers since I had such a good experience with it. This Baby Dry line just doens't work for us. The diaper feels overly moist after she goes number 1, and it doesn't actually seep through, perse, but it feels a little moist and it's not a very pleasant feeling. But one pro is that it's thin so it's very portable. Other than that it was a big BUMMER for us :("
159773,2,"The manufacturer needs to list the minimum weight for use of the child. This bouncer is too upright for my newborn who is currently 6 weeks old. We recieved it when she was about 2 weeks old. My desicion to prefer this product was due to a great review written in reference to a newborn. It didn't work for our daughter, and we need something to entertain/calm her NOW!! We will exchange this bouncer for a different type that is not so upright."
42722,1,"I was committed to babywearing for many reasons before my son was born, but in the weeks after he arrived everything was such a blur. After a couple weeks of his crying in the afternoons I got up the nerve to try the then-complicated process of wrapping him in the Moby and TA-DAH! Instant sleeping angel in his pouch. He lived in it for the first 4 months, and it was the only place he would nap. I walked everywhere with him in it, and when he was awake, he loved being up close to people and interacting with the world. It was a must for travel--I wrapped him in the Moby and used the stroller to push our bags around. It was a bit warm in summer, and we both got a bit sweaty (it washes beautifully, with no fading), but in the cold it was heaven--I never worried about him being warm enough, just dressed him in a regular outfit and between my heat and the moby layers, he stayed toasty. If it was really cold I could wear my husband's jacket and bundle us both inside.Set-up is daunting at first, but ince I found the wrap that worked for us (the instruction book is great, easy to follow, and there are several ways to choose from), it was a breee, and I amazed people with how quickly I wrapped it on and popped him in. I also liked that the stretchyness meant that I could take him in and out without re-wrapping it.I had a black one, and it was, dare I say, stylish! When I wore it over a black shirt people thought it was part of my shirt/outfit. In the summer I wore it over a tank top and it looked like a shirt.My son was a a huge infant, and I switched to an Ergo carrier when he was about 5 months old--he just got to heavy and my back would hurt. I was able to re-sell my Moby, as they are quite popular."
78588,1,"Someone was thinking when they came up with this idea. This product hooks up easily to a rolling suitcase and actually can hold a little one without any problems. Having this makes it so much easier to go through the airport, and the price is very reasonable in comparison with other products that serve the same purpose (like car seat bags you wear like a backpack or the travel car seats that come with their own wheels and handle). When our toddler wants to walk, we load up the diaper bag, my purse, etc. into the car seat to wheel all of it so that I have a hand free to hold onto hers. Excellent, well-made, and clever product."
55324,1,This is such a great lotion. My son is a little over a year and has not had dry skin since we began using it.
23180,1,"My son loved this toy form the time he was teething until well after the time he got his teeth in. I plan on buying this for my daughter who is now 3 months even though she is not teething yet, she loves putting things in her mouth."
17235,2,"We bought this monitor as my husband HAD to have it as he though it was SO cool. However, we have been very disapointed with it. The picture is not very clear especially at night, the receiver is very loud, and the green light that you have to shine at the baby is quite bright and would wake me up! We ended up buying an audio-only monitor and really like it-plus it was cheaper--I'm selling our video monitor on ebay now.!"
137353,1,This is an awesome pillow. It provides not only comfort but stability against the back which I especially like since I tend to roll on my back while sleeping and after a certain point this is a no-no. It's versatility is supreme. It is like curling up into a cocoon. I'd not only recommend it but got one for my sister and my friend has one too!
180553,1,This bag was purchased as a birthday gift for my oldest son. He is in the Air National Guard as well as a not so new dad of a beautiful baby girl.(His 5th child) The camouflage is perfect for a military guy. The features inside were a great surprise. Everything you need for the little one is there including a chaging pad. Quite roomy and adequate.
57888,2,We bought this warmer thinking that it will save us alot of time heating our daughter's bottle. I followed the directions as stated and I still can't get the bottle to warm properly. Sometimes the water will dry out before the milk even gets warm. Its just frustrating that I ended up using the microwave or stove to heat her bottle. There are alot of guessing work on how much water to use even though it came with a small cup to measure the water. The small cup just doesn't work since the machine will automatically shut off when the water container dries out but the milk is still cold. Waste of money..plan to sell it on ebay.
154988,1,"We have a 5 month old and a 3 year old. The good things about this stroller are that because it is narrow it fits anywhere. It's not any heavier than our Gracco travel system single stroller, but not light by any means. It holds our Gracco carseat fine, and it manuevers fine with both kids on it. It has a small storage basket under toddler seat which holds a few small items.The not so great things about this stroller are, there is no cup/item holder. We purchased the Joovy Parent Organizer for about $25 and I'm glad. It can hold a bottle of water and my wallet. The stroller is very long when it's folded up, we have a Tahoe and it just fits the width of the back, if we had anything smaller than a Tahoe it would not fit in the trunk. When my toddler sits on the seat our baby kicks him in the head, this will be fixed once the baby moves out of the carrier but it does make my toddler not want to sit unless he really has to. I would definitely recommend it over a double stroller, especially if you have a younger child like mine that wants to sit, then stand then walk all within a 5 minute period. Just be sure it fits in your car."
116035,0,Pretty good for the price the quality of the basket its allright the only thing i didnt like about this moses is that the handle doesnt stay up but besides that i like it because is pretty huge and very comfortable for my lil man...the delivery service was excellent thank you amazon!!
170531,0,"This is a great car seat for my daughter, but it is a nightmare to carry between cars, or worse through an airport. It is very heavy, large, and lacks any logical handle. The seat appears comfortable even on long drives, but I wish it would recline further for trips when I know (hope) my child will be sleeping most of the ride."
115303,1,"I love this gate so much, I bought two. It's great for larger doorways, because you can add extension gates to it. You don't need any hardware to put this in, and installation is pretty self-explanatory. My toddler constantly tries to push and pull at the gate to gain access to other rooms, but it holds very well to the walls just by tension. Highly recommend."
122331,1,"I absolutely love, love, LOVE this baby food mill. When I first ordered it, I didn't even research any others and it was just a really quick buy, but, I am so glad I have it. First of all, it is BPA free. It makes enough fresh baby food for probably 4 servings, so that I can serve my baby the fresh food for the current meal and then freeze 3 containers as well. It isn't very loud when in use, it is easy to clean, it is small enough to just leave out on the counter, and it grinds everything I've put into it so far (pasta, veggies, fruit). I haven't tried chicken yet but I'm sure it will work just fine. It is one of the mills that Dr. Sears recommends too. I hope this helps!"
10596,1,"A friend recommended I register for these although she knew I was planning to use disposable diapers. I accidentally registered for the diapers with the absorbent centerfold, and fortunately, received these. They are large - 27""x 27"" square and are essential for baby care. I still use them every day and my son is almost a year old. I used them to line his cradle and changing-table when he was first born and going through many diapers a day. They work great as burp cloths, and are superb for wiping up other food messes. Additionally, I found they work as a light blanket during the summer months. Extremely durable, fold-up rather small for travel, and launder well. 101 uses, I love them!"
88724,0,"I have always used Swaddlers/Cruisers for my son, but this time tried Baby Dry on my new born baby girl. Disappointing. She has blow out on the sides and up the back every day. I am sick of changing clothes and sending extra sets to day care. I just ordered Swaddlers again, knowing that they always did a great job. I will then go to Cruisers which work phenomenally with the bigger, active infants. These are just ok diapers. I love Pampers, but ""Baby Dry"" just does not keep MY baby dry."
177704,1,"I used this pump for 14 months after going back to work, even though I work in a hospital and had access to a &quot;double&quot; electric pump.It was so comfortable, fast and effecient, I recommend it to any new mom. You truly can use it anywhere! I am also a flight nurse and occasionally would need to pump on the way to a call. I could stick the Isis pump under my shirt and jacket and no one else on the (very small) airplane would be the wiser. In less than 10 minutes, I would tuck everything away in the little lunch bag, wash my hands with hand sanitizer and back to work.I credit this pump with helping me nurse my daughter for as long as I did, while working full time in a demanding job."
51842,1,"I bought this stroller after much research and deliberation. It is comfortable for my [...]as well as my [...]daughter. It handles wonderfully. It folds pretty well too. The front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature. I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it. I have used this for both walking, shopping and jogging and think it is perfect! From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days. I am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase. I love this stroller!!"
145140,1,"I highly recommend this Jumperoo for any little one. I love to research products before purchase as well as read others reviews. Not only did our FP Rainforest jumperoo have great reviews it's the best invention out there for LO's to be entertained. The main thing I love about the jumper is that it also grows with your LO as it has three levels of height adjustment that are easy to adjust. The jumper offers only two songs but other than that my LO loves to play with the bright colored toys. The seat rotates at a 360 degree angle making it easy for my LO to play with all the toys. We purchased this when my LO was about 4 1/2-5 months old and at first he couldn't touch the ground but after placing a small box he was on his way to jumping land. Now he is almost 8 months and still loves to be in it. He is usually in his jumper for about 10-15min tops, which allows me time to do other things around the house. This jumper is great for girls or boys the colors are eye catching and the best part is that it's easy to fold and take along anywhere. Great purchase!"
52595,1,"My Husband and I both fell in love with this swing the first time we saw it and thought it was such a great idea! I was a nanny for about a year before we had our baby and I also worked with children at a daycare on a part time basis for several years. The children at the daycare loved the swing and so does my daughter! Yes, you do have to be careful not to hit their head on the swing, but come on!!! That isn't all that hard to avoid. You just can't yank them out in a hurry. And it is worth the extra trouble for the amount of time that you get free while baby is entertained! Out daughter is 5 months old and she still sits in it for a long time while i get stuff done."
153144,0,"For the price, I wish I liked it better...but I have to admit, I don't =( The biggest problem for me is the straps. They twist so easily and its really difficult to twist back, I don't understand it. Its very annoying when you are pressed for time and you discover the straps are twisted. You end up wasting a lot of time untwisting. It is a heavy, bulky seat but I was already aware of that when I purchased it. My daughter is now 20lbs and with the weight of the seat, I struggle to carry her in the seat. In fact, I avoid it at all cost because I feel like i'm going to fall over every time.The material is soft and easy to clean. She does get very hot in it though. The base/car seat combination is simple and easy to use. I struggle getting the car seat to easily latch to my Peg Perego Pliko P3 stroller. I really do like the simple designs and colors of the car seat, I hate the way Graco car seats look.They are plenty of other car seats that are comparable in safety standards and are cheaper and easier to use. If I had to do it all over again, I would of never bought this travel system. Normally you get what you pay for but with this, I feel slightly cheated =("
41253,1,These diapers fit my son well and he rarely leaks or blows out of them.
1445,0,"I like pampers, as first time mom i tried several brands but this and huggies were the only ones that worked for me, the only bad thing is that when she poops it leaks if she is not changed right away, but i don't mind dealing w a leak or two for as long as my baby bottom is not getting a rash. The other brands did not have the same quality and will not absorbe the wetness as pampers did."
143453,2,"I thought I would love this after reading the other reviews. I didn't really care for the smell, but it wasn't offensive, so I figured I could handle it since it was all natural. But my baby broke out when I bathed her with it. It wasn't a huge allergic reaction or anything, but looked like slight irritation. I switched to another brand and it went away. I was really disappointed that this didn't work out for me. I had such high hopes for it."
170869,2,"It's very cheap scratchy material and it bled all over, even with a color sheet. I would say don't buy. I ended up making mine from my own material."
32709,1,"I love this carrier! I agree with some reviewers that it's hard to do chores, etc. with the baby strapped on. But, I didn't buy it for that. It's main advantage is that you can carry your baby but not have to hold onto him. My husband loves the carrier and my son loves to hang on dad and look around when we go to the mall, zoo, etc. This way he can see up on our level. This is especially nice in stores without a lot of room to move around in. I frequent antique shops and they usually are old houses with stairs that have been converted into shops. I can'wear' my son on the front of me and look around at ease. It's relatively comfortable (especially for Dad) and my baby stays happier longer in this than in a stroller. It's a lifesaver!"
145317,1,"I highly recommend this jumper! I bought the jumperoo for my grandson for Christmas. He loves it! The bottom doesn't unlock or come about as I have read in other reviews. Maybe that has been fixed. He just turned 5 months old. For the first couple of days he just rocked himself back and forth sidways in it, and still liked it. Now he is jumping alot! He doesn't play too much with the toys on it yet. I'm sure he will as he makes time to discover them. He does look up at the hanging toys and will sometimes try to reach for them. Right now he is just happy to jump! His feet look so cute when he is jumping, all of us were laughing so hard! We have as much fun with it as he does."
47066,1,"I just got this stroller and I really like it. I have a double jogging stroller that I love for outdoor use, but when it comes to shopping or doctor's appointments or whatever, it is just too big. The Joovy is perfect. It moves around so easily and is really compact for a double stroller. My older son loves having the option to sit or stand and my younger one loves the front seat. We did take it on a walk outside and it's not my favorite to push over uneven ground, but the boys both seemed comfortable. Also, I noticed that I kicked the standing platform slightly, which was a little frustrating. Anyway, neither of these things were a problem for me inside, which is primarily where I will be using this stroller. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase."
101936,2,"Just like another reviewer commented, this teether smelled so bad like chemicals I threw it away. Terrible!!! It honestly scared me. Don't buy!!!!!"
62782,1,"We have had ours for 2 1/2 years, and it's still going strong. No complaints."
51381,1,These are wonderful diapers. Super trim and I love pocket diapers. Mine have been through at least a hundred washings at this point and they still look new.
136200,1,"After reading the complementing reviews online but, never seeing it in the store, I asked for it for my son for Christmas. I wasn't sure if he was going to be able to enjoy it right away since the box says 4-12 months and you never know if they are exaggerating. Well they weren't and my son loves it. He likes to spin around in the chair, chew on whatever he can, and lean on the book that makes noise and talks. He is able to entertain himself for 10-15 minutes while I am able to get things done, knowing he is in a safe place. This is one of the more expensive models but it is worth it and a must buy!"
77881,2,"My husband and I searched for something convenient to carry our sons Britax Marathon carseat. We purchased this item because it had wheels on the bottom of it and thought it would be convenient and easy to carry on and off the plane. Number 1: Do not try to roll it down the airline aisles. The aisles are not wide enough for your carseat! We had to carry the carseat anyway. So much for the wheels. The wheels came in handy rolling it through the airport only. Number 2: By the end of our trip (we had only used this item twice) there were large tears on the bottom of it from being rolled through two airports. The only reason why I feel it was a good buy was because it got us thru one trip. If you plan to buy this for one trip only then I would recommend it (but not strongly) If you plan to use this item trip after trip, then look for another way to tote your carseat."
49134,1,"Bought this for my grandson. My daughter uses it everywhere. We took it camping, had two toddlers in there, never had to wrorry about them getting out. It is nice and strong and you can add to it. It is a little heavy to move by yourself."
92916,1,This Portable Cot has been wonderful! We purchased it for the holidays when we would be visiting friends and family. My daughter is two and does not fit in a pack and play comfortably. She could not sleep on an air mattress or the floor because many of them have hardwood floors. To keep her warm we opted for something off the floor and we found this. It is so easy to put up and take down and it stores nicely. This is the greatest thing we could have bought for the holiday travels.
21454,1,I bought this because my son seems to have sensitive skin. He has had no reactions to this lotion. The super sensitive has no fragrance which is nice if you have sensitive skin.
101667,2,I couldnt belive it when I saw this monitor I thought it was purfect until I got it hom then threw away the recipt (big mistake) and the box (trash day too.) This Monitor is the worst monitor I have ever seen. Sure the set up is ok and it is versible but all night it makes this anoying clicking noise. The reception is horrible! When my phone rings it goes crazy! (Click...Click....Click)This thing Has kept me up every night since I have owned it. I do not recomend spending the amount of money on this monotor. I'm going to buy a 20.00 dollor one today!
153510,1,My son loved the awesome colors of Sesame Street fizzy tub colors. Ill be buying more! He wanted to play in the tube even longer.
79263,2,"I hated this diaper cream. I like the other items in the CA Baby line, so naturally thought I would love the diaper rash cream. My son had his first sensitive rash-y spot, and I applied this after briefly looking at the ingredients. Zinc oxide (like Desitin), but also lavender oil. Sounded a little irritating, but I put it on anyway....you should have heard the scream my son let out. I could barely wipe it off fast enough - and the area was redder than ever (it was a very sensitive spot). He cried and cried (angry, painful sobs) until I applied regular Desitin - not a peep. I threw it out immediately - couldn't believe the reaction he got from it."
129675,2,"I bought these because I wanted very badly to breastfeed my daughter but we were having latch-on problems. I was told that nipple shields could be helpful for this.I went with the Avent because overall, I am super impressed with their products. I only use their bottles and pacifiers and have been a happy customer in the past.I don't really recommend these specific nipple shields. I can't get them to stay in place and they are really akward. My daughter dislikes using them and I can't get her to nurse with these.If you are in the market for a nipple shield, go with the Medela brand ones. Those are much easier to use and less akward for baby."
7413,1,"We have really enjoyed this stroller, It is very easy to just snap in her carseat and go. It is easy to steer and folds up easy. I didn't get one of the travel systems so this has come in handy while my daughter is still in the car seat and not sitting up."
140652,1,"Our son gets mesmerized by this mobile. Even when the music stops he can't stop staring at the mobile. He would lay in there for such a long time if I would let him. He stretches him arms out to try and reach the animals, and has since he was about three months old. I know it's a bit pricy, and money doesn't come easy for us, but it is so worth the money. My only gripe is that it is not battery operated with a timer. That would make it perfect. But it's not, so we are completley happy with it."
168482,1,"We started using Pampers when our son was born becuase that is what the hospital used and they gave us several packages of them. We liked them and continued using them. We purchased them through Amazon Mom, becuase they were quite cheap compared to the store. Our son turned seven months and we decided to try other brands to try to save money. We tried Wal-Mart, Target and even Huggies. We did not have any leaks in any of the other three, but the Swaddlers just were softer, had more cushioning and felt like a better product so we went back to Pampers Swaddlers. I beleive they are the best diapers out there and we feel its worth paying the five to seven cents more per diaper for Pampers."
55461,2,"This bottle warmer was horrible. If you are formula-feeding, just use the microwave. Really. It takes so much less time, and all you have to do is shake the bottle really well to eliminate hotspots.This bottle warmer never heated bottles evenly. Sometimes they would be scalding hot, sometimes ice cold (and then you have to wait until it's completely cooled down before it will allow you to heat it again!). Not only that, but it always took a minimum of 5 minutes to heat the bottle. Meanwhile, my baby is screaming because he's hungry and wants that bottle!! The microwave only takes 30 seconds and it's the same temperature EVERY time.If you're heating expressed breastmilk I can see why someone would need a bottle warmer.Otherwise, what is the point??"
71947,1,"We started out using the Graco Snugride for our son. He is approaching the time when he is going to outgrow that car seat and we looked to Graco for the next appropriate car seat because we really like our current one and we know that Graco makes very safe car seats. This is a rear-facing car seat and is much larger then the Snugride. The car seat itself is really comfy looking. The seat is super soft and a lot more padded then the SnugRide. I bet my little guy will love this! I wish I had known about this car seat originally, because it can be used on newborns and has a higher weight/height/age threshhold that it can be used until. With the SnugRide, we could easily take the whole seat out of the car if our son fell asleep in it and take him in the house without disturbing him. Because this car seat is bigger and heavier, I forsee it staying in the car and taking our son out and either carrying him or using our umbrella/lightweight stroller to get out and about. Another small setback is that it comes with a different base to install in your car. No big deal, but if you've already bought an extra SnugRide base for a second car, you'll have to do it again for this car seat. If I had bought this car seat originally, I wouldn't have run into this small snag. Live and learn!"
70430,1,"I LIKE THIS SEAT! IT WILL LAST TILL MY SON IS OUT OF A CAR SEAT. IT IS HARD TO BUCKLE (WITH THE CARS SEAT BELT)WITH THE BOSTER SEAT STILL ATTACHED, BUT WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF IT WORKS JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. I HAVE NO COMPLANT EXCEPT THAT IT IS HARD TO BUCKLE IN THE CAR WITH THE CARS SEAT BELTS. I HAVEN'T TRIED THE TEATHER SYSTEM."
40244,1,"I have a new grandson and I am his Pampers Fairy. Try to send them to him as he needs them. Just enjoy helping out and know this is something he will defenitely use for awhile. The Diapers come even faster than the estiamted delivery date. Thanks, Amazon."
83772,0,"Our daughter asked for two of these for her daughter, so that's what we got. We thought they were a bit stiff and difficult to use, but perhaps they'll be better after being out of the box for a while. She liked them, and that's what counts. We did not like our experience with the manufacturer, Healthcheck systems, and would not buy anything from them again. Despite a shipping charge of nine dollars, they used a flimsy bag for shipping, and the boxes were crushed, not suitable for gifts."
131201,1,"I was amazed at how much more secure the seats are (they don't move at all!) than they were with seat belts. We got one to try it out and now we're buying two more so that our infant, toddler and preschooler all have them. They do take a little muscle to install, but it's a small price to pay for the extra safety. I also recommend that you get a seat protector because since the seat is fitted more firmly, it will more likely mar your car's seat unless there is a layer between the vehicle seat and the car seat."
172952,0,"From the picture and description I thought I would be getting the ""reach-in"" tubs of wipes. However when they came to my house they were the pop-up kind. That's NOT what I ordered... I was NOT HAPPY!!!"
60362,1,This tub may be big but it is worth the extra bulk. The molded reclining positioner is excellent and keeps baby from going anywhere. Now the other side gives our little one enough room to play and splash but still keeps her safe. It is luxury.
173065,1,"I bought this last year for my daughter when she switched to a dual-mode booster seat in hopes of providing additional protection for the car from the car seat. I had previously used several variations of a car seat protector but none offered the same type of stiffness as this one. It offers a little more protection than the softer ones. The bottom pad has a slight lip that curls up which I found has caught some crumbs from my daughter's snacking. With small children, crumbs are invitable but it was nice to see that the seat protector caught some of the crumbs too. My 9 month old son is still rear facing but using the softer seat protectors which flop down at his feet. If I had it all do over again, I would have purchased this from the beginning."
93501,1,Comfortable for little onesDid not leakAttaches to regular toiletWe never put batteries in it so didn't have to worry about having a problem using the regular toilet later on.
103523,1,"i love this seat. it holds a lot of weight and stores all i need for her bath and more. i keep her soaps, toys, towels, and other miscellanious bath items in here. would recommend it to everyone. also i love the two height settings"
183414,1,"My daughter and I ran all over town looking for just the right swing. We couldn't find anything in stock anywhere that was the right style, color, and price. We found and ordered this product online on a Sunday night and it arrived on Tuesday afternoon. The price was better than any we saw in the stores. We were thrilled and wish we wouldn't have wasted time looking in the stores. Thanks!"
40507,1,"We are using pampers cruisers for my son since 18 months. And he is 2 now. First six months we used pampers swaddlers. Then we switched to pampers cruisers. We tried huggies, pampers baby dry and kirkland (which are availalbe in costco for cheaper price) in the middle. But nothing matched pampers cruisers. whenever we used huggies or kirkland for my son he use to get diaper rash and he always felt unconfortable. So we decided not to go with any other brands other than pampers cruisers."
147487,1,"This bouncer does what it says it will...it bounces. No extra vibrations, no psychedelic colors, no silly cartoon characters. My little guy has been comfortable in it since he was a week old.The company sent the wrong color, but very good customer service. They offered to send out the black right away. The navy that I received is so dark, I had a hard time determining if it was the wrong color."
85380,1,"I accudentally reviewed the wrong pregnancy pillow earlier. THIS is the one I have! It is AMAZING! I am pregnant with twins and this pillow has saved my life. It is so comfy that my hubby, who works 3rd shift, crawls into it in the morning! Sleeps like a baby. I daydream about nightfall when I can crawl into my cozy little nest, so warm, comfy and hugged! I like that it will also double as a dual nursing pillow once the babies are born."
148905,1,"I love this pillow, it has helped my back pain and sleeping difficulties. I'm not pregnant but I locve this pillow."
19246,1,I registered for this item and was very glad that I did. I use it in my little boy's stroller and his swing. It's very cozy and supports his head and body well. Worth every penny!
13501,2,"I bought this crib rail cover thinking that it would be nice to be able to remove it for cleaning. But, like other reviewers have indicated, the 4 pieces of this crib rail cover can be TOO easily removed - by a baby. My 8 month old thought these were toys - he'd continually remove them and either toss them on the floor or sit and play with them in his crib. He'd then proceed to chew on the bare crib rail. So...while these are nice 'in theory', they're useless for the intended purpose. I've since purchased the Gummi crib rail cover and my little one enjoys chewing on that. Hopefully, it'll stay put for a good long while :)."
168796,1,"Love the fact that Pamper's decided to put the wet indicator on the 2's. Our daughter still wets her diaper quite frequently so it's nice not to have to open it to see if she has a wet diaper. Pamper's swaddlers and cruisers are the only diapers we have found that don't irritate our daughter's skin and are much softer than Huggies or other brands we've tried. We do occasionally have leaks, but less so than with other diapers as well."
5266,0,"I got this breastfeeding pillow because I'd be traveling a lot with my newborn and couldn't hold my baby due to problems with one arm.Pros:1) I felt really secure with the pillow strapped on. I could clip on the pillow, go to pick up my daughter, then start to feed her as I typed, ate dinner, whatever. I was working one-handed much of the time by default and still really enjoyed this pillow.2) It is reversible, so you can put the clip on whichever side is most convenient. 3) In reading other reviews, the clip fastener on Viva is a ton quieter than velcro would ever be.4) Loved the back support in chairs5) After my daughter started sitting up to eat, I could detach the backrest and prop her up in the pillow for feedings.Cons:1) developed a slow leak in the backrest after a few months. I could use the pillow without the backrest, but it wasn't as good. The leak was along a seam, making it near impossible to repair with duct tape. I tried an innertube repair patch, but those leaked too.2) it's a bit of a struggle to get the pillowcases on - I was being careful to prevent zipping the inflatable pillow into the zipper.3) it would be helpful to have a spare pillowcase to handle spitup, etc."
125834,0,I bought three boxes of these on a Friday special for $19 plus free shipping. They were so cheap I had to get them. I usually buy the P. Cruisers which I think are much better. The Huggies I bought tend to leak at night. The tabs also tear way to easy. My son rolls over and if you even tug at it a little it tears right off. They're made too cheap.
88107,1,"My mom bought this for us and it works so well.My son would lay on the mat forever and just look at the toys. As he got older, he would play with them. The hooks hold the toys on so you don't have to worry about them falling and hitting your child.The octopus was my son's favorite toy for the longest time. We would unhook it from the mat and attach it to his car seat or stroller whenever we would go somewhere.My son still plays it even though he is eight months old. My husband's three year old cousin recently came over and even she laid down and played in it.It is very easy to clean and fold up when you are done with it.I highly recommend it and there are so many add on's that you can buy to change out the toys that you don't ever have to worry about your child getting bored with this."
112198,1,"I've had great luck with Pamper diapers, they seem to fit my larger babies beter than the others. I've tried Luv's and I think we had blow outs almost every time, so just wasn't worth the hassel or worry. Huggies worked alright, but they seemed to fit smaller on my babies, so we would always have to go up a size. So for all you mothers out there that have the cutie chunky monkey babies, I would recommend these Pampers Cruisers or the newer Pamper Baby Dry with the elastic tabs (they have improved them with the new stretch and find they are almost as good as the Cruisers ( and a bit cheaper) They just seem to fit a smidge smaller than the Cruisers. My oldest baby (21 months) have even gone down a size in diapers by using the Pampers Cruisers ( we had been using the Huggies baby shapped because we got them at a good price at Sams' Club). Just watch the price on the Cruisers and Baby Dry's. Amazon has great prices with the plus of them delivering them to your house. We did however find the Pampers Cruisers and Pampers Baby Dry on sale at Kmart recently that ended up being cheaper; and then with a coupon-even better. So if you happen to find time, watch for the sales at the other stores, but otherwise Amazon has great prices, service and shipping- we've been completely happy with everything that we've purchased! Only giving them a 4 star because of the price otherwise it would be a 5!"
74391,1,"Well I think this is a great booster! I need a second one. I take care of kids at home too and have put 4-5 months old to 3 year olds in it and it's the best. So what if you have to take it apart to clean it? At least after that you know it's CLEAN!It might be hard to travel around with it, but I haven't had a problem. It's also dropped, but nothing broke, like one of the review said. It might get scratched, but so what? I've had it for 2 years now going strong and it's great. From using it on chairs to the floor, it comes apart, stores well, and I can even walk around with it to my neighbor closed up, with out the tray.It's an excellent chair and it's a excellent price too. If you want to go and get a ""higher quality"" one that reclines, has padding, - have fun cleaning the padding when the kids are older - just get a high chair then. How can you recline a booster on a chair?!"
180147,1,"This product gets just as much, if not more, milk as my Medela Pump 'n Style. I exclusively pump due to my son's pediatrician insisting he have bottles in the hospital, and going forward with that while I slept, although I refused when awake. My son is now too impatient to nurse, but I want him to have breastmilk, so I've been exclusively pumping for six months now. It's exhausting, and I've found that I like this manual pump a lot more than I like the Pump 'n Style.First of all, this gets the same amount of milk in the same amount of time. Even when double pumping with the Pump 'n Style, it takes about 30 minutes to get about 3-4 oz altogether. With the Harmony, I get just as much, if not more, in the same amount of time -- although I'm only pumping one breast at a time. My supply is also increasing because I use it more. The big electric pumps are a huge pain to get out, set up, and especially clean. I found that I dreaded pumping so much that I wasn't doing it as much as I should -- and I didn't have time for it! Having to sit there for half an hour every 2-3 hours is tedious to say the least. Then, if my son started crying, it was a huge pain to stop, turn it off, set it somewhere safe, get the bottles of milk to a table or the fridge so they wouldn't get knocked over, etc. With this, if he cries, I just set it down. No big deal.This is also a lot more convenient to take places, takes a few minutes to wash, and easy to dry. The Pump 'n Style needs to be really dry so the hoses won't suck up water and get moisture into the motor. You almost need two sets of parts so you can use one while one set is drying. Additionally, if you do take the Pump 'n Style somewhere, finding an outlet is a pain, then leaving the room at someone's house and having the loud thing on is pretty embarrassing. With the Harmony, I just take it to the bathroom, pump quietly for ten minutes, then I'm done.Really, I can't say enough about the convenience of this thing. But, that said, it does tire your forearm after a while. You get used to it and build muscle, though. I've never had any problems with suction or anything breaking. Great quality, sturdy product. I did buy the Lansinoh manual pump yesterday due to all the reviews and am interested to see if it yields more milk and if it's easier on my arm. I'll write a review on that after I use it."
29737,1,This is a great diaper bag. Has all the perfect pockets that you will need on the go. The material is study and easy to clean. Thanks for a great bag!!!
38914,2,"liked bather at first, but when began to mildew and we FOLLOWED MFR'S INSTRUCTIONS, completely ""pilled"" and filling clumped. our baby is allergic, so things need to be clean for him. MFR was not interested in hearing our concerns either."
26811,1,"It's much better than I imaged. I just received it today and put it on right away since my growing belly really start to hurt my back. It feels like magic. I can feel the support to my back. It works perfectly for me. I sit in front of a computer most of the day and it just feels the right support that I needed. Also it's perfect size! I imaged it would be uncomfortable but surprisingly, it's very comfortable to wear! I should've got it sooner! :)"
84932,1,"When my second child outgrew her infant carrier and moved into our convertible car seat I needed to find another car seat for my 3 year old son. I was not sold on putting him in a booster seat since he was still so young. But after 3 months of searching online and going to stores I found the B500 Booster and loved everything about it. It is sturdy and when the back is raised as he gets taller it is completely padded all the way down. He is safe and secure and he loves that he has a big boy seat. He never complains about being in the car and falls asleep easily. It is very easy to move from car to car for going with grandparents and fits anywhere, even in the back seat of a Mustang. The armrests flip up so you can buckle with no problem. I love this booster and would recomend it to anyone whose child is ready to move out of the convertible car seat."
84033,0,I want a set for 3-stage as shown in picture. But I got a set of 3 at one size.
168253,1,"Ten to fifteen years ago ""Pampers"" was missing the ""softness"" that ""Huggies"" could provide, they didn't ""hug"" nearly as well as ""Huggies"" at the time. Not anymore! Pampers Swaddlers are soft, and truly ""hug"" to the babies form. The diaper is ultra thin, not the same as they were years ago, and are super absorbent. The changing color strip helps to determine when the diaper needs changing-when sometimes just ""feeling"" the outside of the diaper does not help determine. I have been away from diapers for years and recently needed to ""choose"" a diaper, these by far are the best diapers out there today. It will not take a consumer long to try other brands and realize that ""Pampers"" are the way to go...well worth a few extra bucks to keep your baby dry, and leak proof!"
73529,2,"i thought it would be a great thing to have, i think it's useless. you need to change the diaper as needed not in certain amount of hours, especially poopy ones. also it's better to feed on demand. so this thing is left unused.plus mine just didn't work - the numbers were shown partially, so i could never figure out what number it was. it faded really quick."
159883,2,"After about 2 months of use, our gate has gone to the trash. I hardware-mounted mine at the top of our stairs and I encountered the same problem as others here have noted, with the plastic hinges splitting and of the unreliable pressure lock that ""pops"" open.So I went to the local Toys R Us for a different gate and while I was there, they had one on clearance because the locking mechanism had broken on it too - why they would try to sell it is beyond me. Anyway, since it was open I looked at the construction of the lock. It's all plastic, and it is a zig-zag channel with a locking piece that bites into one of the indents when the pressure lock is pushed in. Over time, the channel wears down and the locking piece can't get a good bite in the channel, hence the ""pop"" you hear when the lock begins to fail."
58475,1,I love this sterilizer. It is fast to sterilize and stores well.Just watch how quickly you remove it from the microwave. The steam can get out through the sides if your not carefull. Works great with my Avent small and large bottles.
142414,1,"I purchased these rails when my 19 month old daughter moved from her crib to a ""big girl"" twin sized bed. Although the instructions weren't SUPER easy to understand, assembly was completely doable and took me about 30 minutes from start to finish. The rails are very sturdy, fit very tightly to the mattress and have not torn/bent/etc like you see with many bedrails. I like to research and read reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.com, and I'm sure that many of you are the same way. I 100% recommend these rails!"
18985,2,"I have great nieces and nephews, who visit and I wanted something inexpensive to use for them to eat, instead of somebody holding her/him. I purchased this Booster Seat about 3 months ago, and had a chance to use it today.The seat is sturdy and the harness straps hold the booster securely to chair, but it is not worth the aggravation of dealing with this tray. I couldn't get it on, so had my husband try. He finally got it on, but we had to get it off. After we finally got it off, we looked at each other and said,""We weren't doing that again!""In a year it will serve as a booster, but they really could have come up with a better design that this!"
135460,1,"I bought this Graco monitor to replace a Fisher Price monitor that we had used with our first child. I was initially skeptical about how good it would work when I saw the low price, but I decided to try it anyway. It is absolutely fantastic! I can't say enough good things about it. The reception is consistently clear and static-free. The range is great. The receivers are easy to move around the house. I would definitely recommend this product."
54395,1,My son has loved this mobile since he was about 2 weeks old. He is now 3 months and it makes him chortle with glee. He can easily spend half an hour by himself watching it which has many days been the time I get to myself to shower. The moving parts do make a fair amount of noise but if it keeps him entertained I am happy. I would recommend it without reservation.
109996,2,"since 14 February, made ''the purchase of the product and the date the product has not reached its destination. I would like to know where I can not complain or where I can request the return of money or product."
86757,2,Spring completely wore out literally after one day of use. I still use it everyday at work but its a pain when the silver piece gets on the wrong side of things and my stuff falls.
89498,1,"It's a well recommended product. Therefore what I would like to comment is, based on my job I work late unplanned hours and it's very difficult for me to plan my shopping list. Having Amazon door to door service for this product is so convenient that it ease myself so much. You place the order and it's delivered to your door step on time."
17044,1,"I love this monitor!!I was so apprehensive about letting my daughter sleep in her own room for the first time. I just didn't want to let her out of my site.My husband talked me into putting her in her crib in her room and hooked up this monitor....OH JOY!!! There she was, and it has NIGHT VISION, TOO!! I was able to sleep peacefully (for a few hours at least), and if ever I wanted to turn over and look at her, there she was!! I could even hear her cooing in her sleep! Very comforting.This product is an A++ I would highly recommend buying this.**Has a little interference problem sometimes, but the good FAR outweighs the bad with this product!**"
97991,0,"Love the bottle. But my son sucked for 5 minutes before I realized he wasn't getting ANYTHING out of the stage 1 nipple. Even month's later, when I decided to give the nipple another shot, he BARELY got anything out. And the stage 2 nipple was still way too fast for him. I use Gerber nipples with this bottle, despite the fact that they leak a tiny bit (because Playtex designed this bottle to not support any other kind of nipple but their own). Playtex needs to get with the program and get a Stage 1 1/2 nipple, or something. I expected more from such a great name. But I still use the bottles because I invested the money in them. Now I'm just waiting for the day when he graduates to the stage 2 nipple...no more leaky substitute nipples."
77977,1,"We love this highchair. Its very comfortable, SUCH a beautiful design for boy or girl, and easy to wash. My only bad thing to say is that the dishwasher safe tray NEVER fits in the dishwasher..its huge and it doesn't fit right in any dishwasher so if you are looking for a highchair with a easy dishwasher safe tray, probably not the best one. But this chair makes up for it : )"
152992,1,"I literally installed these in under a minute. The tiny tot magnets took me half an hour and required a lot of drilling to exact dimensions and even that didn't work flawlessly.In short, this product is fantastic. Could not be happier."
37626,1,"This is the softest wipe that I have found on the market. After finally finding these, my son cries if I use anything else because they hurt his skin. These are not just for infants - any parent using a wipe for their young child should consider this to be their top choice."
88491,2,"This carrier is way too bulky and a complete pain to put on. I registered for it after reading some favorable reviews but wish I didn't. I am going to try another brand. If your baby is small you have to pull all the straps so much that you have tons of things dangling all over the place. It is hard to get her in and out of it without major disruption to her, and no matter how I adjust it the left shoulder continually slips for me. It is also too small in the waist adjustment for my husband who is a pretty big guy. I thought the Bjorn carriers were overpriced but I am going to try another brand. Very disappointed."
181682,1,"This is the simplest and yet the most amazing invention I have seen in the world of baby equipment!! You can't really know how good it is if you are a first-time parent who has never bathed a baby before. But if you have ever had the experience of trying to gently but firmly hold a tiny, slippery, flailing newborn with no neck control in the bath and then you have a chance to use the Daphne, you will know what I am talking about! It allows you to use both hands to bathe and soothe your baby, while the baby is cradled and secure. It works in the tub or a sink and can be used up to about 8 months, when baby is sitting steadily. I can't figure out why the Daphne hasn't caught on yet in America (apparently it is quite popular in Europe) but I put it on my list of absolute baby essentials!"
30613,1,I bought this tub for my friend for her new born baby and she really liked it. It was a good price and way cheaper than what Target wanted. Good buy.
107377,0,"Love the fact this pail can use regular garbage bags. However, diapers get stuck frequently and you then have to take off the lid to deal with it. Kind of a pain."
4217,1,I was given one for my newborn and wish I had this when my oldest was younger then 1 too. Super easy to use and a great keepsake
57193,2,"I BOUGHT THIS AFTER READING THE REVIEWS IN HOPES IT WOULD WORK FOR US AND KEEP THE SUN OUT OF MY DAUGHTER'S FACE. WELL I TRIED EVERYTHING TO KEEP IT ON MY WINDOW BUT GLUE IT!BUT WHAT MAKES IT REALLY BAD IS THAT IT FELL OFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND HIT MY BABY GIRL IN THE FACE! I WOULDN'T DARE BUY ANOTHER ONE, AND I ABSOLUTELY DON'T RECOMMEND!"
64528,0,"This would be a great little gate if it would fit tightly in my doorway. I am not sure if the little rubber screw knobs are defective or the holes in which they screw into are defective. They do not tighten up against the door jam enough for the gate to stay firmly in place. It is loose and gets knocked over. I have not contacted the seller about it however. Luckily, I have a little ""chicken"" dog who hasn't dared to jump up on it and knock it over. But sometimes people walking over don't lift their foot high enough and it falls down. Otherwise, it would be absolutely perfect for a small house dog to be contained in a room."
57699,2,"We bought this bed for our daughter even after reading the reviews about the problems other people had...we hoped for the best. Unfortunately, we encountered the same problems of poorly designed pieces that did not fit together the way the manufacturer intended. The right bed guard will not stay attached. I guess you get what you pay for! It is a cute bed but just not worth the trouble."
77855,1,"We really like this chair, it has a non-foo foo pattern, not to babyish, and is super easy to use. Our son loves sitting at the table with the family! It also works well on a kitchen bar."
112788,1,"Very nice suitcase, but really a lot smaller than I expected. It would be more of a &#34;show&#34; piece, than usable item"
17862,1,"I bought this for transitioning my son from my room to his crib in his room. I though something that would keep his attention in the dark would help him not focus on the fact that he was in different place. It may have hepled, because he has slept peacefully in his room since the first night, and he seems to really like it.The characters that dangle from the mobile are cute, and the light show projection is entertaining for the baby since it projects right onto the canopy, close to his face where he can actually focus on it as opposed to ceiling displays on other products. There's a seperate day and night setting, both playing music but with the added light show on the night setting. I have found that unless it's super bright in the room he can still see the light show durng the day, so I just always use that setting.One thing I really like is how migh above the mattress it hangs. My baby is currently almost 6 months old and is nowhere near being able to grab the characters. The music box part that fastens to the side of the crib, however, is well within his reach, he plays with it ALL the time! I like that I'll be able to keep that attached to the crib even after I take the mobile down.Some disadvantages...like other reviews stated, there is somewhat of a grinding sound that comes from the motor inside, however mine must not be as bad as some have described, because it isn't loud enough to drown out the music or anything. Really loud noises must be manufacturing flaws and I'd recommend sending it back (keep the box til you make a decision!).You pretty much need to be in direct line of sight with the mobile to use the remote. It's not that bad, but it's annoying for me because my room is directly across the hall, and I still have to get up and stand at his doorway to use it. No big deal...just kind of annoying.Many people have complained about battery life, but I think the problem is leaving the mobile on all day, draining the battery. There's an ""off"" position, and then night and day ""on"" positions. When the mobile stops playing after its 10-minute interval, it is still ""on"" as long as the switch is in either the day or night position. Get in the habit of pushing the switch over to ""off"" before going to bed or whenever you take the baby out of the crib, and not turing it on again until the next time you lay him down to use it. Makes a huge difference.One last thing that could be improved is the music...there are only 3 different songs and one ""nature sounds"" option, it'd be nice if there were more."
137482,1,"We already had purchased the ladybug version of the twilight collection and loved it. My kids (3 and 5) got bunk beds and could never agree on which color stars to have lit each night. I decided to get the turtle so they could each get one (and the one on the bottom bunk could see the stars clearly). The only difference between the turtle and the ladybug is the turtle has the colors green, blue, and amber (yellow). The ladybug has green, blue, and red. Both products are amazing and my kids can't sleep with out it. It is nice that is has a 45 minute shut off timer on it also to save battery life."
60348,2,"My 9 month old son loves bath time with the Fisher Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub. It's got anti-slip for infants and same goes for the toddler position. Only thing I did not like about the tub was that it's too shallow and my son is big for 9 month. (I'm guessing the depth has something to do with safety).My brother who just has his daughter said his Primo tub was too big so he wanted to switch.Pros..it's bigConsit's too big and waste a lot of water. over twice as much water as the FP whale tub. Which I would not mind if it was bit deeper so my son can get a better submersion but it's not any deeper than the FP whale tub.Main problem is that Flooring is too slippery so my son was startled everytime his bum slipped against the floor. He loves bath time with his Fisher Price Whale tub since he was an infant. Always smiles and never wanting to get but yesterday for the first time, I saw him startled and whining to get out of the tub. Never once saw my son slip on the Whale tub. In fact he would rotate and splash around while taking a bath without a problem. With Primo tub he stopped dead on his track, scared that he would slip.I supposed you can put a towel to offset the slipping problem but I think I'd rather look for another tub."
114939,1,This is great for taking to see the grandparents or visiting anyone else. Very light and portable and easy to attach to any chair. Also cleans up fast!
129732,1,"I ordered this for my almost 2 year daughter and it is gorgeous. Much better looking than in the picture.It is sturdy and putting it together was pretty easy. The hardest part was aligning the slats into the holes on both rails at the same time by myself. If I had waited and had somebody help it would've been a cinch. Otherwise it was super easy and didn't take long at all.The crib mattress fit perfectly, nice and snug. The weight limit is 50lbs but I have sat/lain on it and it held up fine although I wouldn't make a habit of it since I am 100lbs over the limit!I would definitely buy this bed again, it looks beautiful in her room."
157018,0,"This is a great entertainer, however, one should consider this: my son is 6 months old, and in the 95% for his height (28.5 inches). He is on the third and heightest height adjustment, and his toes are more than just touching. The warning lable says not to have your childs feet flat on the bottom. I worry that he may only get a couple months use out of this because he will be too tall.This has so many toys, which is great for them not to get bored, but my son seems to become overwhelmed and not able to focus on one toy. So if you child is average height, I wouldn't think twice about it purchasing it."
98695,1,"We have 4-yr-old twins and have used Britax Roundabouts in both our vehicles for over 3 years. We recently bought a Regent for our son, who had outgrown the old seat, since we wanted to keep him in a 5-point harness as long as possible. The Regent is an extremely comfortable, well-designed seat and is obviously big enough for years of use. Our son likes it and calls it his ""astronaut seat"". I would give it 5 stars, except that it's so big (compared to the Roundabout) that some cars will have trouble with it. We have it in a Volvo V70 wagon, where it fits but definitely needs all that space. In a small car the leg room could get tight, and the height of the seat could cause visibility problems for the driver. Measure before you buy. We have a Honda Civic also, and chose not to get a Regent for that car because of limited space. For the Civic we got a Britax Monarch booster. If you don't feel a strong need for the 5-point harness, the Monarch is probably more practical."
65453,1,This is a terrific baby cleanser for my baby's sensitive skin that isn't irritating and has no annoying scent.
71361,1,"Length:: 0:55 MinsAt about 10 weeks old I noticed that my daughter loved to kick. I began the search for an appropriate toy. After much research, I decided this was the one for us.Although we have only had it for just over a week, it is fantastic. From the very first time she played with it, she quickly figured out that if she kicked the ball then the bear would move and light up and music would play. It also has some hanging toys that hang by her arms that she sometimes tries to grab.It was easy to put together and seems very sturdy. It will also grow with her. When she is sitting up, there are chutes along the sides for balls to go down and the bears face lays flat and becomes a sitting toy.I included the video review so people could see what it does. When I was looking for this type of toy, I wanted to see it in action and the only place I found that was from the previous amazon reviewer, so thanks!If your baby loves to kick, then this is definitely the toy for them. Even if it only interests her for a couple of months, I will still be satisfied."
109523,0,"I think this is a great concept but I find it very hard to clean. Banana is almost impossible to get out. All the fibers of the banana get stuck in the seams and it is so hard to get out. I ended up cutting the extra mesh around the seam hoping it would help a little. I put them in the dishwasher, use a scrub brush, etc but there's always something left. And then it gets dried up in the mesh and flakes off but is still stuck in those darn seams! Maybe I just need to use firmer fruits and veggies and leave the banana for finger food.Kind of a hassle but baby loves it and I can give her a little ""appetizer"" while I am getting her meals ready."
145577,0,"Well I had a Fisher Price Deluxe Jumperoo and my daughter loved it. I got the bright idea to sell it and buy this version which looked so much cooler! I can tell you I don't think the design is built as well, the frame jiggles in as baby jumps (the Deluxe doesn't). The toys, while it seems there are many (10 total) are not that interactive...the two that hang are out of babies reach. The fabric seat isn't as cushioned as the deluxe. My biggest complaints though are the construction, compared to the Deluxe, it was harder to assemble, the fabric seat isn't as easy to get on and off for cleaning or as strongly held on the seat as the Deluxe, this seat has holes in the fabric used to ""snap"" it over plastic circles whereas the Deluxe has thick nylon tabs sewn to the fabric seat that hold this in place. It is also harder to adjust the height levels. I'll keep this but I am now in the process of trying to track down a used Deluxe to replace the one I sold. Hard to believe these were made by the same company."

Emptying this thing takes some getting used to, and the diapers can not be left in the Genie for more than a day or two because it stinks too much. The Diaper Champ is much neater and easier to use. Spend your money on the Champ instead."
151017,1,"We just assembled this last night and so far so good! It looks great in person - I love the sleigh look of it. It seems like good quality although we have not used it yet since baby is not here yet. The drawer seems sturdy and will come in handy. The only thing is the two shelves are made out of a semi-flimsy white material (not wood) but when you secure the shelves in the wood sides, they are very sturdy. Once you put items on the shelves you don't notice them either. I think most changing tables use the same materials for the bottom shelves.Also warning - do not buy a contoured changing pad with this! It comes with a thin, but perfect fit changing pad and strap. We bought the contoured changing pad thinking that would work but it's too high for the top (covers the nice scalloped design on the back) and you can't screw in the pad because of that scalloped thing. You need a changing table dresser or one that has no decorative piece on the top in order to fit a contoured pad."
170380,1,"So happy that I chose the Britax Marathon. It was defineatley worth the wait after all the research that I have compiled over the past month with other mothers. Their experiences with the Britax Marathon made me feel so secure with my purchase.If you are a parent whom is transitioning their little one(s) into a convertible. Then the Britax Marathon is the only seat you should consider. I am especially thrilled that the 5 point harness can handle the weight of a 65 lbs child and the maximum height of 49"". That means my little jack will be in his seat for quite some time........thats reassuring!I made my purchase online and after searching carefully. I purchased my seat at travelingtikes.com There prices are competitive and sold the seat to me for $209.99 including shipping.After recieving my seat I installed it in my car almost immediately. Even though the instructions were somewhat complicated to understand the seat did not budge once in place.Im a happy Britax customer. I hope this info will help other parents in there never ending search for the best seat ever made!"
64342,1,Product is exactly what I was looking for and is perfect for not only hiking but for getting through crowded festivals or train rides without having to navigate a stroller.
73332,1,"I got this with Baby #2. The reality is that you don't need it for your baby. You change them when they're wet. You feed them when they're hungry. They will let you know all of this. You will quickly be able to tell which breast you used last with a quick poke.However, it is priceless for raising a toddler. They need to eat three meals and two snacks a day (every three hours). They need to be reminded to sit on the potty every hour or two. They take two hour naps and you won't be able to remember whether she went down at 12 or at 1.There WILL come a day when you are laying on the floor with a 100.4 degree fever with your 18 month old bouncing off your belly trying to remember if you changed his diaper today and figuring out whether you need to feed him again yet - and he's not going to let you know if he's hungry.She will get sick and you will need to give her medication every four hours...or call the doctor back in a 1/2 hour if her fever goes down. Was that at 2:30 or at 3am??? And it's really fun for your kid to play with the buttons when they're on the potty - just flip lock switch so they don't reset everything.The itzbeen timer is foolproof to operate - it's easy to set the time and the alarms - I did it without the instruction manual, you just press and hold buttons. It's also easy to turn the alarms on and off - another press and hold, and the sound option is another switch on the side. The only drawback - it was a challenge to me to remove the battery cover and install the batteries. Not so much for my toddler. However, she's only done that once so it hasn't been a problem. A little duct tape would easily take care of the situation for a more persistent kid."
131363,1,Its perfect!! I dont know about the dye problem because my seats are black leather. But i love this! I would def recommend this product!
64762,1,"I breastfeed my 5 week old daughter so I am holding her a lot and needed somewhere to put her down occasionally but she craves movement. This is perfect for a 30 minute break but I would invest in recargable batteries. We had her in it for literally 10 minutes with the swing, lights, and music going and the music started slowing down."
15858,1,"This product is great at keeping my six month old warm, but it could be longer. It seems to bunch up at the bottom and I can't adjust it to make it fit smoothly. It has a nice flap that you can cover the baby's head with when it's cold out without having to cover it's whole body like some other products I've seen. Material inside is nice and soft and the outside is easy to wipe off."
38842,1,"Our son is 5 weeks old and I don't know what I would do without this! Coming home from the hospital, I was petrified to give him a bath. But this product saved me. It's soft and comfortable for him and keeps him warm. And it gives great support for me... no slipping! So much better than putting your baby in a plastic tub! I will buy this for all my friends having babies."
2420,1,"Hi,I'm a firsttime mom, have a 4 month old girl, have only used pampersdiapers because of there reputation. the first month swaddlers and after baby dry. She only gets breastmilk so her poops are fluid. I am very satisfied with these diapers. In the 4 months there have been a couple of ""poopleaks"" mostly up the back, and always when the diaper wasn't puton right or it had to be changed al ready and mostly when she was in laying in my arms(half reclined with a bent back) while eating..She is 7kg now and still has some of the size 2, so I change her after every feed( about every 3-4 hours)or if she had a poop. at night I sometimes skip a change if the diaper still has ""room"" left.when she was about 3 I could leave her in a diaper for the night, sometimes 9-12 hours stress without any problems, but as she got bigger I guess she pees more per time so I change more often. I think it will be better once I switch to size 3. There have been days that I left the diaper on too long and she poops and I look at the diaper thinking this will explode!!!... never happend...neather leaked!! that's way the 5 stars. I have seen what it can do.The diaper is really very very soft, has a very very faint babypowdersmell... I would wear it myself. She has never had a diaperrash.I'm very picky when deciding what to buy... I believe there is only 1 the best.. for my girl for now this is it. It may change once she poop get firmer... if my opinion changes I'll update you in a couple of months.As I buy the diapers at amazone.com and with save and subscribe.. I get a realy good bargain. about 30$ a box of 204 diapers size 3!!!!.good luck.Update:Now at 7 months, wearing the size 3,she's 8.5kg, I had a couple of urineleaks in the night. never had them before, it suddenly started. She would be in one diaper from bathtime(19.30) till mornig(~9am) without problems before, but recently started leaking badly. And a midnight diaperchange always wakes her up..so now I use a size 4+(7-18kg) specially for the night and the size 3 for daytime and it works like a charm. other then this...still perfect diapers to me."
60901,0,We never had any problem using this product.It's a good concept but then it works out to be expensive.If the price of the refills were not this much it would work out fine.
184222,1,This is a wonder for helping a newborn to sleep in longer segments. I give one to all my friends after my brother had such success with it and my nephew.
65466,1,"this Stelactiv cream gets rid of really bad diaper rashes...it's a little pricey, but worth it. I got a sample of it that ran out and had to buy more. A little does go a long way so you don't need to goop tons on when you do use it. It's in a soft metal container (not a concern, but figured I'd mention)."
21571,1,"My son, who is now 10 weeks old, has had this bouncer for about a month. He LOVES it. He's very comfortable in it, likes the bouncing and vibration, and is absolutely enthralled with the mobile. He recently started trying to touch and grab the little bear and the bee as well. This has been such a great investment. I love the look of it too, and the music is not annoying. I also like that all of the features work independantly of eachother. I can turn on the mobile, but not the sound, or turn on the vibration, but not the mobile. It's great all around."
4710,1,"Seventh generation diapers are by far the best diapers that I have ever used on my child. It is to bad that I did not know about these with my last three children. Ordering through amazon with scheduled shipments is the most cost effective way that I have found to purchase these diapers. Ordering is easy, and the delivery is very fast. I am very pleased with this product, and will continue to use this service, until my child is out of diapers."
124192,1,"I've tried virtually every wipe on the market for my four kids. This one is by far my favorite. Earth's Best wipes are too small (but otherwise good) and 7th Gen are too dry.The only reason I didn't give Tushies 5 stars is because the top comes off the tub every time I use the wipes.The wipes are a good size, have just the right amount of liquid to do the job, and of course - they're all natural. I just wish they sold refill packages instead of having to order all the plastic tubs each time!"
145331,1,"BEST Purchase ever made, Simply that!! My child LOVED this jumper, so I had to recommend it to so many of my friends who just had a child the same time as I. I found this product at an acquaintances house. I put my child in it to see if she would like it. She was a lil small at the time but there are adjustments to make for when they grow, and if the noise is to loud you can always have the music off, which was never an issue. But what I also liked about this jumper that others didn't have was, the back/neck support. That's what made me purchase this jumper. I found it very easy to clean, and would take off the cloth material and throw it in the washer. I would move this around while cleaning our place while the lil one was in it, before I knew it she was alseep. She would wear herself out, all the jumping, laughing/giggling & excitement all in one (she would ALWAYS fall asleep in it). Great toy, highly recommend, I think your lil one would Enjoy it as much as mine did."
47867,1,After purchasing a different gate and seeing this one at a friends house I knew we needed it. We have a bi-level home and it is perfect. It keeps our son safte during the day and we can leave it open when he is in bed and go up and down the stairs without a hassle. Best baby purchase yet!
178317,1,"My baby loved this the most out of all the 7 baby carriers I bought, but she outgrew it before she hit 22 pounds, like it said it went to. She started to get very squished in there before we hit that mark. She always wanted to be facing outward, and the Baby Bjorn is the only carrier that does that. It feels very secure, and the padding makes me feel that my baby is comfortable. It does start to hurt your back and shoulders because there isn't any support, but seeing as it doesn't carry a baby very heavy, it is OK for shorter trips. My baby fell asleep very easily in this carrier- every time I put her in it. It's extremely easy to buckle and unbuckle- I LOVE that feature. I just wish they made it for bigger babies!"
56785,2,"After reading reviews of multiple potty chairs, I was excited to get this one! Everyone raved about how unique the design was, and how easy it was to train a child. The actual potty seat insert is so difficult for my daughter to sit on, because of the design of the built in splash guard. The seat is not anchored to the chair in any way, so the entire seat can lift out (or be lifted in the case of a curious child). There are no arms, so my daughter is turning herself sideways to get comfortable and avoid the splash guard. Wouldn't recommend it!"
77558,1,"I've been using the swing since day one! My daughter likes it in swing mode vs cradle mode and I love that we have the choice if she changes her mind. It's very easy to change between modes, I can do it one handed. The music is great and really helps put her to sleep. I think the lavender color a little on the girly side but still plan to use it if we have a boy. The mobile is cute and the stars are a great effect at night although i think a little bright. My daughter tends to play with the mobile rather than have it lull her to sleep. The curtain easily detaches if your child is like mine and eventually started grabbing it. It is really cute though. The description says you need batteries but mine has the option of AC adapter or batteries. I've never used batteries since I don't really move it much.As a side note, i bought another papasan swing (the bumble bee one) at a thrift store for use at grandma's house. This one did not have an AC adapter and the swing ran fine in battery mode. We even put used batteries in and they still didn't die after 7 days of use. I love love love this swing! It's quiet, has many options, and very cute!"
144134,0,"Weve had the Svan for almost five years, used it for two kids from highchair with chair, to junior char.No doubt it is a great looking chair. It is very well made, after all these years it is still solid, the wood is perfect. My only complaint is the exposed screws on the seat and foot rest, as well as the divets in the wood to construct it. The are FOOD TRAPPERS and impossible to clean! Ive tried to go into the edges with toothpicks, knives, skewers, etc, its just impossible. And if you get a rice kripsie in there, forget it. A glob of tomatoe sauce, gross.So sure, you can clean it out, but you cant get it perfectly clean. The food cruds up. My chair still looks great, but this really bugs me that its not a solid piece of wood, at least in the seat and footrest area. Makes no sense. So honestly, we ended up using our cheaper Scandinavian chair more often. From that giant chain of stores that shall remain nameless.For this reason, I do not recommend this chair. I would have gotten rid of it years ago, but it was one of those ""have to have"" things while pregnant with my first child. And it was expensive, so I just never got rid of it"
166692,1,"it is a good diaper, because it is reasonable price, good quality, comfortable for baby, over all i can say good diaper."
56404,2,"Okay these things might work okay, but they are cheap cheap cheap. They broke apart pretty quickly offering no protection.So yeah, it may work. . .but then they break and you think to yourself ""yeah, that was a waste of money"""
155596,1,"Very light and easy to carry in my backpack. My little girl was in the midst of a city street party and there was nowhere to go...she didn't think twice about using the Potette. Only problem is that the absorbent pad wasn't absorbent enough. In future, we will carry one of our left over diapers to place in bottom of bag."
109917,1,"I've used the Dex Safe Sleeper for my four year old grandson--who is a handful. He slept well and remained in bed!The Safe Sleeper is attractive and safe--much appreciated!Sincerely,Carol Drollinger"
124296,2,"Unit falls off too easily and get stuck closed, we took it off for now."
184498,1,"I have used this seat extensively with my youngest daughter, now one, and have found it to be priceless at keeping her secure and safe from the yucky things one finds on shopping carts. I would highly recommend this to any new mom who prefers to use store shopping carts to keep their babies comfortable and safely seated."
128783,0,"my baby is 8 months old, he's having his milk with cereal on the bottle so i bouth the variable flow but it's really fast even on the number 1"
61067,1,"My husband begged me to get this! I said 'no way'. I had heard horror stories about how difficult it is to use, and that it doesn't really work. I also thought it was pretty gross to leave dirty, soiled diapers sitting in a room, even if the smell is masked. But he got it anyway. He ran out and got one when the baby was one week old.Now I am glad we have it. It really does work. It is a little tricky to figure out (I kept twisting the wrong part and cutting off each bag), but it is worth it. You can empty it as often as you wish, and you don't have to use it for the really nasty diapers. You can always run those out to the trash outside. It is pretty inexpensive for what it does!"
157882,2,"I followed the set-up instructions very closely and reviewed them several times before the twins actually arrived. We tried to use the movement sensor when the first twin came home from the hospital. The first night the movement sensor alarm went off randomly about once an hour. This sent me sprinting through the house in a panic (the first few times) to the nursery only to find a perfectly healthy alive and breathing infant. I adjusted the sensitivity with no improvement. Tried on the other twin once he came home and had the same results. Tried different pad/sensor placement, backing boards, without backing boards and still had false alarms.We gave up on the movement sensor. We still use the sound monitors because there are two receivers. They have so-so reception in our fairly small house but work well enough. The nicest feature is the circular antenna which makes it easier to stuff a monitor in a pocket while holding a baby. I honestly prefer the fisher-price monitor because the reception is crystal clear, even over greater distances and through many building materials."
174191,0,The overall performance is well but it uses batteries like crazy and the motor is relativly loud. I would recommend it because nobody can compete.
24083,0,"These breashshields were recommended to me by a lactation consultant. The inside diameter does fit better than the medium size the pump came with but I really need it to be smaller as too much tissue is still drawn in.The outer shield part is too small, it doesn't even cover the dark areola. Medela shields get smaller as the inside diameter goes down. If your breasts are large with small nipples none of the shields will be comfortable. The opposite is true as well from what I've read, if your breasts are small with large nipples the larger 'correct' size for you will not be comfortable.If medela would make shields the way bras are made, with two measurements, it would be great.They get three stars because it's good there are size options, some pumps don't have interchangeable shields so it's good medela offers this option to the women the various shield sizes will fit. They also work ok. I ordered the soft shields (in their only size, medium) to see if they will work better than these and be more comfortable."
37806,1,The items in this all-in-one set for the nursery appear to be well made! A huge plus are easy to grip handles for mom or dad to manipulate during bath time with a wiggly little person!
83750,1,lie back and try the DaVinci tool - my neck is getting better every day
65294,1,Don't skimp - this is definitely a must have on your BOB. Could be improved I think by the company but it certainly serves its purpose.
107858,1,Really essential if breast feeding... extremely easy to assemble and then take apart for easy cleaning. Definately something I would advise any new mom to get.
170638,1,my son is 10mths old. he is big for hi age 31 inches 25lbs. i bought this for him because he absolutely loves wheels and steering wheels. so it is absolutely as cute as it looks. my baby is a biy snug in it but he is just fine. he loves honking the horn and the big rearview mirrors that hace twirly things on them. it is reall cool that you can push the seat forward and it becomes a standing walker.cons-it will not roll on carpet at all. glad we have hardwood floors...it is a big snug for bigger babiesit is not really bouncy at all
84590,2,"Don't even waste your time. I bought the single pump, it stopped fully pumping because (I guess) I got water in the pump cleaning it. So, I bought the double pump, and it never worked! My baby is only 4 months and evenflo pumps have never been efficient."
68247,1,"Just perfect for a wet head. I have had these before and used them so much , that I wre them out. I really love them...Thank You"
154914,1,"I honestly cannot believe the first reviewer. The chair is made from high quality materials, the finish is very good, it is very easy to assemble and beats other similarly designed chair by a large margin in price.My son loves the chair, he loves the fact that he can get on and off of it without our help. We like the fact that this chair actually matches our kitchen furniture and doesn't look out of place like a lot of other high chairs. The chair is amazingly stable, which was my initial concern, we can actually use it as a step stool or ladder.As far as ""you get what you pay for"" as the first reviewer mentioned... I have no idea what that is all about.I actually went to the local store, after getting the Hippo chair and seeing the first review, to check how could the quality of that other, much more expensive chair be better. I couldn't see any difference, both are greatly designed and made products... except for the price. Which made a big difference to me.I didn't get a chance to find out how good the customer service is since everything went perfectly."
101500,1,"The seat is great. We have this one and an Eddie Bauer that we bought for double the price at Babies 'r us and I honestly can't tell the difference. The color is a nice slate blue (greyish) with a black ""trim"" and it looks great in a black car interior"
44491,1,"Got this sheet to us in my daughters pack n play, it is outstanding. It is very padded which is excellent considering most p&p's are not all that padded. it is great also to cover the plastic that most pads for p&p's are. I am so happy that I got this sheet my daughter slept fantastic when she had to use her p&p for sleeping."
26322,1,"When I was traveling alone with my baby, it allowed me to push a stroller, pull a suitcase, and carry the carseat at one time. If I can make one addition to the carrier, it would be to add another strap so that an adult can wear it like a backpack."
100200,1,"We used these for our older son and our now using them again. We feel like they have less of a &#34;pee&#34; smell than some of the other brands. (Sorry that is gross, but there is no other way to say it!) Good absorbency, soft, reliable."
70323,1,"We installed this gate. by measuring acuratly and put it into a STUD. It is 11 feet and is in a L position. I have had no problems with it. I did read the reviews and was leary. a friend of mine did not install hers correctly and it was just popping open. Instead of blaming her self she blamed the gate. We looked and saw that it was a 1/4 inch off of measurement and fixed, now it works. I know when things are not working properly i check my work over a few times and then I make a judgment on the product. I love the gate and it works in my situation."
184306,0,There are some great things about this product and not so great things. First the product was great for traveling as it folded up into a nice size. The night light was the perfect amount of light as it was bright enough to see while nursing but not to bright as to wake up my husband. The down side to this product is the size. My child out grew it by around 5 weeks as he grew just too long so we didn't get a lot of use out of it. The other down size is that we have a queen bed. It was very tight having this in the bed. We barely had room to move around and slept on our side because basically all the room we have.
61725,0,They are ok and get the job done...no leaks so far...the only complaint really is that they run pretty small in my humble opinion...a size 6 pampers or huggies is WAY BIGGER then Drypers size 6. I would say the size 6 dryper is roughly the same as a size 4 Pampers Cruiser.
116064,0,"Even though the dimensions are listed in the description these seem small and we can not use the hood at all, it will not go over our toddlers average sized head, I doubt it would fit most babes over 6 months old. We gave it 3 stars because 1. we can still use the body of the towel, 2. it is fairly thick (not like a thirsty adult towel) compared to hooded towels found at the ""Super Stores"" and 3. it is still putting organic next to skin."
87873,1,"We have twins and bought 2 different activity mats and this one was great. We were able to put different toys on the cross bars and change the visual keeping the babies interested. They learned very quickly how to reach and grasp at what they wanted and I was able to have them entertained (and learning about their world) for a short time without having to hold them continually. Having twins meant one had to be put down often in order to take care of a need with the other and this toy was a must for keeping them happy while doing that. While the colorful mats caught my interest, the babies loved this black, white, and red model the best. I used this until 9-10 months old when they started to &quot;toddle&quot; around."
106771,1,"Diaper champ has been absolutely wonderful. It prevents smell in the nursery and provides easy, sanitary disposal of diapers. It is a better value than diaper genie because we have been able to use our own regular kitchen trash bags, without having to purchase refills (as you need with the diaper genie). Several of my friends who have the diaper genie regret having bought it because the cost of the refills, and are envious of my diaper champ. It is a must have!"
82123,1,"My daughter just turned 2 (today) and recieved the Dream Castle bed a couple weeks ago from her grandparents as an early birthday gift. She loves it. From the time we started pulling parts out of the box, she was in awe. When my husband and dad were putting it together, she couldn't get enough. We told her it was her new bed and she kept saying ""I yike my new bed"" over and over! Now, anything pink and princess looking ""matche my new bed"" and she loves it. We put up a princess border and curtains to complete ""The Princess Zone"" and she's in heaven! Bedtime is just a little easier and even at her short 34 inches, she can climb right in - but she doesn't fall out at night. She had been sleeping on her mattress on the floor for the past 6 months. She decided that she hated her crib, but we didn't feel she was ready for this bed yet. The timing was perfect. She is old enough to understand some things and she knows and understands that she loves her new bed!"
136287,1,My 4mth old daughter is extremly active and her attention to toys is very short. I tested about 4 of these in the store by putting my daughter in them and watching her reaction. She loves this. She lite up in the store. We brought it home and I was able to cook a complete meal while she played. I haven't completed anything while she has been awake since the day I bought her home. Each time she plays with it she learns something new. I'm amazed each time she discoverys it does something new.
78689,1,"I chose to buy this product for a recent trip with my daughter. We wanted to gate-check her car seat but I didn't want to carry a 20+ pound Britax Boulevard through the airport.When my order arrived I was a bit disappointed. I didn't think there was any way the strap would work--it looked so small! However, it turned out to be perfect. It was very simple to use and I had no problem attaching my daughter's huge car seat to a 16"" wheeled suitcase. It was so easy to use that I had no problems detaching the seat to get through security and quickly reattaching the seat after we passed through.I think this is a great product for a casual traveler!"
177848,1,Just wanted a nice one for pictures - so I guess worth that. But for actual swaddling purposes found muslin ones at target stores which are 44x44 and you get 3/4 for the price of this + shipping!
81714,2,"I am a first time mom and registered for this monitor before reading the reviews. I liked the thought of having dual monitors. I still gave the benefit of the doubt and tested the monitors before our baby arrived in just a few weeks. Thank goodness we did. One of the parent monitors was broken. We even switched outlets and batteries to find out what the problem could be. But had no luck. Being 38 weeks pregnant and exhausted, the last thing I want to do is return this product in exchange for another brand. My suggestion to all the parents is to do the research before purchasing or registering."
37150,1,"My husband picked this out for his Daddy Diaper Bag. It's made from a material that will be super easy to clean, it's adjustable strap is great for putting it on the stroller, and the design is super cool. Came with a changing pad inside and lots of pockets!"
56398,1,They fit loosely on the knobs so they just spin when little hands are exploring. They open easily for me when I cook and I haven't had any issues with mine melting or breaking. Maybe Safety First has made some improvements since some of these reviews??? I've had mine for about a year with a (now) 2 and a 3 year old who are both very active and very curious. They give me those few extra moments to get to them and steer them away from the stove and back to where they are supposed to be without them being able to turn on the gas or having the stove light.
134239,0,"First off, I put wipe warmers in the same space as diaper pails - you really don't ""need"" them. However, if you decide you really want one, this is a good one to get.You definatley need to get ""pop up"" wipes, otherwise you'll have to open the unit every time you want to get a wipe out. We never had a problem with browning, and only added some tap water to the pad with every refill. When we refilled with a pack of Costco wipes, the warmer lid wouldn't stay completely closed since it was slightly more wipes than the unit could hold - hardly a flaw with the unit itself. We got around it by resting an object on the lid to keep it shut until some wipes were used up. It does a good job warming the wipes. The push button lid release is very handy and easy to operate with one hand - easier than the lids on some store bought wipe packages. The biggest benefit: the opening in the lid has little ""jaws"" that you can use to grab the edge of the next wipe. So you can always just pull 1 wipe out. Nothing more annoying than grabbing a wipe and ending up with 3 stuck together.Sadly to say it does not change the laws of physics and any wet wipe will still cool off if held in the air. So use the wipe and don't stand there holding it."
73017,2,"My daughter started potty training & within days she developed a dry scaly rash along the sides of her butt where contact was made with the seat. I stopped putting her on the 3-in-1 potty & started using a different potty seat & the rash went away within a day. I'm sure the design of the seat contributed to the skin irritation, since everytime she got off, you get see the red ring indent left from the ridge of the seat. So from my personal experience with the seat, I'd advise you to not buy it."
161612,0,I chose this product for my registry without reading any reviews. I immediately began using it with my newborn daughter and it worked great. I loved the idea of the plug because you can empty out all the water easily. The only bad part was that there were many cracks which were difficult to keep clean and dry which would cause to get moldy. I thought that was pretty disgusting. But I continued to keep using it until the bottom just all of a sudden cracked one day and I had to throw it out. Now I am pregnant again and am searching for a better tub for my baby.
132831,2,"After reading several online reviews, including the ones here, I opted for the Diaper Dekor. What a mistake. It was able to contain the smell of infant diapers well, however, now that my daughter is 5 months the Dekor does nothing to contain odors. In addition, the flap door on the inside completely broke off. We do not mishandle items and have always been gentle putting diapers in. I do not believe the plastic door should break in 5 months. I know many people love this item. I recently checked the claim of three odor seals and discovered the ""seals"" are simply 3 plastic doors that close on one another. There is one rubber seal however the trap doors do not completely seal. Do not waste your time and money as I must now find another diaper pail."
8718,1,"This is a great product for when your child refuses to sit in highchair or booster/traveling seat anymore. We purchased this and it is great! Sits the child right at table level same as mom and dad. We got it for our son who just turned two and wants to be independent. It's great. It's alot of money but worth the cost, especially if you plan to have more than 1 child. You won't be dissapointed!"
84265,0,"We bought this despite seeing other reviewers mention what a pain it is to get this to swing straight. Indeed, our swing had cockeyed ropes permanently riveted in position, cheaply and quickly done. My husband is a professional rigger by trade (""key grip"" in the film industry) and after spending quite a while adjusting all he could- the swing is still uneven and it swings at a diagonal angle. Back to amazon it goes. I'll look for the older models of this type of swing, back when they were well made."
1142,1,"My daughter started in Pampers at the hospital. Due to an overwhelming supply of Huggies at home, she started wearing Huggies. They leaked EVERY time! I promptly returned them all and bought Pampers Baby Dry - haven't had a problem since!"
132063,1,Got it for my roommate. He loves it. Very good quality and good for the price. Recommend for spider man fans
83492,1,"These changing pads are the best! They fold up into the diaper bag, are washable, and they fit perfectly in the Diaper Deck and Koala changing stations in most public places. We've even done emergency changes on the grass outside when facilities inside weren't available. The best thing about them is their flannel soft cover. It's comfortable for the baby. I've used these pads with all three of my kids. I wouldn't go out without one in my diaper bag."
67903,2,"Thankfully I got this second hand at a a great discount, but I still feel like it was a waste of money! The rounded bar support for the toys is not stable and falls over which I don't need to explain why that is such a poor design for infants. Save your money and pay extra for a product that is safe for your child."
92147,1,"I have to honestly say that I love this pillow. Anyone pregnant can tell how hard it is to sleep & get comfortable, but with this wedge I have slept a lot better. I actually purchased two, one for under my belly & the other one for my back. I use them both at the same time lying on my side...it provides great comfort while sleeping or just relaxing. If I am reading I also use them to lean on. I highly recommend this pillow & if you can get two, it's so worth every penny."
40269,1,"I was sad when my little girl outgrew the last size (size 2) available in Swaddlers and purchased both Huggies and Pampers for her. The Huggies leaked out of the inside leg seam every single time, so I tried Pampers - both Baby Dry and the Cruisers. Although neither leaked, the Cruisers seemed much easier for her to move around in and the fit is amazing.You can tell pampers has done their baby-research!! Thank you!"
154319,1,"I love this product, primarily because it is free of animal ingredients and they do not test on animals. Secondarily, it is a great product that I can use, and not worry about toxic chemicals or undesirable ingredients. I use them for everything, and we don't even have kids! We keep a box in the car, and they are great for cleaning up little accidents around the house, especially for our pets. I also get a great price from Amazon, as they can be a little pricey in the store. I truly love this product!"
45,1,"I purchased this product for a recent beach vacation. It was really nice to have a place for my 14mo old son to play when he got too hot in the sun. He did think it was fun to try to tip the tent over!! The only downside to this cabana is that you have to put it together like you would a camping tent, which means you have to insert the poles into the holes, etc. And with a toddler who likes to explore, this can take more time than you would like. Nonetheless, we are still very happy with this product and would recommend it highly. Last thing - one of the best features of this cabana is that folds and packs away very small so that it can fit on a suitcase for flying."
75900,2,Pros:stick very wellretain stickiness even after washinghide the nipples wellcons:even though it hides the nipples you can see the flower shape protrude over 2 layer of clothes. Will not recommend.
169304,1,"I've fostered many infants, preemies and normal size, and the *only* diaper that doesn't leak with any of them are Pampers Swaddlers. I've tried all the other major brands and generics (they're often donated free to foster parents), and they all leak. I much prefer to pay out-of-pocket for these. What I would've saved in cost from the donated diapers or lower-priced name brands and generics, I lost in time, detergent, water, and power from having to wash so many clothes that were leaked on during the day. Once a baby grows out of newborn and size 1, and maybe size 2, you can try the cheaper brands and generics. Until then, stick with the Swaddlers."
116043,0,"Ordered this for my son's new baby and it is a nice basket. The only thingI don't like is how the hood fits on but I see why it has to do that. Itjust doesn't look ""finished"" with it being on with velcro. It's a showergift for them, so I hope they like it!"
31184,0,"Hello,I have a capri quinny buzz stroller and I would like to buy a new seat cover but I can't find any. I was thinking in maybe buy the black one but I can't find a black hood to go qith it. Does anyone know where I can find them?Thank you so much"
119615,2,"Horrible - I can't believe Fisher Price actually markets this as a &quot;monitor.&quot; If all you are looking for is entertainment for your baby, then by all means, spend the money and buy this. If you are concerned about hearing your baby when he/she needs you, DO NOT BUY THIS. The noises and light show are nice, but if you can't hear the baby to know when to turn them on, what good is the monitor?? Just as the other reviews state, the &quot;clicking&quot; noise the receiver emits when it is on is incredibly irritating and drowns out any noises your baby may be making. To avoid interference and static, the receiver's volume has to be so low you can't hear what's going on in the nursery! We returned this and bought the Sony Baby Call monitor and it is PERFECT - NO static, NO background noise, NO interference. AND, it's cheaper!"
72417,1,"This safety strap was really easy to attach to our TV and it is really secure. If you are looking for a TV strap that doesn't require attaching your tv to the wall, get this!"
66880,1,"I bought extra accessories when I went back to work...and it was a life saver. I kept an extra set of supplies in a sealed plastic container and would just have to worry about taking the bag and milk home and back. The Micro Clean bags are great!!!! I even used them at home when I didn't have time to sterilize over a stove...Charlotte's mommy...Miami, FL"
66625,2,"To make a long story short- this $300 stroller is now an overpriced garage ornament.-The seats are way too hard to adjust (including the belts)-The front wheel has fallen off while walking 3 times and now has been ""husband rigged!""-The front wheel no longer turns- only stays in forward position.-The stroller no longer folds up to be transported.-The stroller is way too wide to maneuver anywhere except for an open field!-Sun shade? No- it barely covers the kids hairline.-Not easily washable*Just to be clear, we were super pumped when I first received it. Though it only lasted for about 3 months before the front wheel fell off the first time.I had done my research and based my purchase off of reviews from other parents on jogging strollers and felt that this stroller was the best rated compared to others in its comparable price range. Lets face it, I was not going to spend a mortgage payment on a double stroller! A Bob Revolution was out of the question and my husband would have given me dirty looks! And- to make another point, I have NEVER actually used the jogging stroller to ""JOG."" I can't imagine the pieces and parts it would be in if I attempted to run with it.I am very disappointed in general with the stroller. If I can offer any advice, I see used strollers on Craigslist all the time. Our jogger will be in the dumpster this spring, use it at your own risk!"
37174,1,"Don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, this ZOpid 2.4 Ghz Wireless Color Monitor with Sound, Motion Sensor & Night Vision is great! It would be extremely difficult to find a similarly sophisticated security system at this price anywhere, it would probably cost much more if you could find it.NOTE: The quality of ALL wireless transmission/receiving systems are dependent on their immediate wireless environment. That means whether or not you have a home WiFi network actively broadcasting through your home, or if your neighbor(s) have one or more WiFi networks active, or if your microwave is constantly in use, or you have multiple wireless phones broadcasting in tandem.ALL of these items factor into the quality of signals sent and received to your wireless 2.4 Ghz color monitor system. Also, COLOR video and sound signals require much more power and carrier waves to transmit, so that is another issue.With that said, this ZOpid system which I just installed is working as expected, event though I have my own WiFi network broadcasting in the immediate area (as do several more of my neighbors). The image quality is still strong and clean--once in a while it may pick up a stray microwave oven interference but overall the signal is very satisfactory. The trick is to keep the monitor as close as you can to the camera. You need to experiment with the location, angle and position of the unit, plus adjust the built-in antenna position to achieve optimal reception. This system is also picking up another (non-ZOpid) Swann Nighthawk 2.4 Ghz wireless color camera that I had already installed some distance away, and that signal is strong and clean as well. So you don't necessarily need to get the ZOpid branded additional cameras.You can choose to ""Arm"" each camera to switch onto the monitor upon activation of its motion sensor, or you can leave the camera on normal mode and manually view each channel. Another option is to ""Scan"" each channel automatically on the monitor in turn. Cameras can be ""Armed"" for motion sensing independently.This system also comes with a handy credit-card sized remote control for operation of the monitor to view all cameras from a short distance away. I also purchased the matching rechargeable battery for the monitor unit, which turns it into a portable security monitor, very cool! The camera can also be powered by a 9V battery via a supplied battery cable, so the whole camera/monitor system could be portable for use anywhere.Only minor quibbles would be the manufacturer's use of old-fashioned DIP switches to control the on/off funtion of the cameras underneath the monitor's chassis, plus having to remove the back of each camera to manually set the camera-number DIP switches there as well. Very inconvenient and hard to do if you are not accustomed to this type of switch, plus they are VERY tiny--I had to use a jeweler's screwdriver to physically move the switches up and down. Also, the documentation in the manual is a bit sparse and could be more clearly written. If not for these, would have rated five stars.So overall, four stars for this ZOpid unit rating, I am very happy with this purchase!"
26568,0,"This is a very beautiful bassinet but I think it's very expensive, does not rock automatically, and the music sounds cheap and distorted. My newborn son does not like the tunes and dislikes sleeping in this pricey Eddie Bauer Bassinet. He's been sleeping in our bed. It's too bad, cause it's such a nice piece of furniture but poorly manufactured. ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"""
90492,1,Cheaper than big stores and great value . Lightweight and keeps babies dry and causes less irritation to babies skin when compared to other brands
167270,0,"I do love this car seat. The only downsides so far is that it sits really high in our SUV. And it says that it is for kids 49 inches and below. Well, my son is only 37 inches tall and he only has about 4-5 inches to the top of this seat."
163822,1,"Fits securely to our small kitchen chair. Straps and buckles keep baby in chair safely and are easy to adjust. I like the height adjustment of the entire chair, but wish we could adjust the height of the tray (can't imagine other highchairs do this either). LOVE the Scatterbug pattern, it's adorable and not loud or offensive in our kitchen. We haven't used the reclining feature because it seems like an awkward position. Maybe when baby is ready to hold and drink her own bottle, this angle might be useful but I do not anticipate using it for any other reason. The only complaint I have is that the tray doesn't always attach to the arms easily. Often it needs a little wiggling to get it to click into place, at the same setting on both sides. It sometimes clicks crooked. I think the problem is that the arms are not very stable, so it's hard to get a good 'fit', I guess. It's especially difficult when using the button on the front of the tray. It's easier to get it to work properly using the side levers under the tray. Besides that, we really like this highchair."
73508,0,"I really hoped I'd love this product but I'm finding that it's only useful to track time between feedings. It's an awful lot of money to spend for just that purpose. If you really plan on micromanaging your baby's life and timing everything you will love this. Otherwise a pad and paper work just as well if you only want to track feeding time, like my husband and I do."
12682,0,"We have used the Listener off and on for 3 months. At 25 weeks we heard his heartbeat, and have heard him move whenever we have used it. In fact, my wife, when concerned that she hasn't felt him move in a while, puts it on her belly to make him move around. Which brings me to the reason for my rating title. A co-worker is also about 6 months along, and owns a listener as well. She and we both notice that the listener seems to irritate our babies, causing them to kick and punch at it. I talked with BebeSound's support, and they said their testing indicates the device is completely passive and emits no sounds or vibrations. The representative also stated that in the years they have marketed the product, he has heard nothing of the reaction our babies show to the device. I am concerned that whatever causes them to move may somehow harm him, and so we have ceased using it. I am trying to contact BebeSounds to obtain additional information. On the other hand, our OB says this at least indicates that the baby has good nervous system functions."
184532,1,"This item is great. Especially when your baby can not sit up yet but is out of the infant carrier. It helps hold the baby up in the shopping cart. Then after baby is a little older it is really good to keep them in the cart. It is quick and easy to put in (after a few practice tries). It is not bulky or ugly like some of those shopping cart covers. You can also use it in those resturant hi-chairs that are usually pretty gross. It has nice long ""arms"" that wrap around baby and has strong velcro. I have used mine for 3 kids and it has held up to machine washing and LOTS of use!"
152634,1,"I gave this item 4 stars because the manufacturer should have made this item in one piece. There is a bottom piece and a top piece that had to be lined up exactly with the bottom piece in order for the mural to look right. I found it difficult for only one person to apply. After going through the trouble of apply the bottom part evenly onto the wall, I had to go through even more trouble of lining up the top piece(Plus the fact that the material stretched which made it hard to line up). I think it would have been easier to go through the trouble of lining up one big piece. The quality is good, thick material."
132262,0,I ordered this at great expense to be delivered to the Uk. Although the item itself is of a good quality it s much smaller than I expected and suited to a table lamp not a ceiling light fitting as I thought.
182650,1,A good friend of mine has this stroller and did not purchase this product to go with it. It was very inconvenient for her not to have the cup holders so I decided to purchase the organizer with the stroller. I'm so glad I did it was worth the extra expense. The extra pockets are great and the water bottle holders expand and will hold larger bottles(one of my main concerns).
18175,1,"My daughter began playing with this toy at about 6 weeks. I play with my daughter often and most of her toys provide her with entertainment for a good period of time, and for a little while this one did too. However she seemed to grow bored of it sooner than I thought she would. I would wind up changing the toys around in an effort to hold her attention and if that didn't work, she'd roll over and peruse the mat for a bit but that wouldn't last long because she would get frustrated. I'm not sure why there is a picture of a rabbit by the way..it almost seems like an after-thought. I gave it four stars because there were plenty of times where she genuinely enjoyed this playmat, but it is unfortunate that she grew bored fairly quickly and frankly, the rabbit is useless."
157407,2,"This product is, as many other reviews pointed out, very complicated to put together (Fortunately my brother-in-law is a carpenter and so didn't have much trouble, but I couldn't have done it.) Unfortunately, the delivery took longer to arrive than I had expected and when we opened it to put it together discovered that one of the pieces was damaged (lower panel piece). The damage was not due to shipping since the piece was snuggly packed in the middle, so it was damaged before and packaged & shipped anyway. Since Amazon would not replace only the damaged part, and it took a really long time for the original order to arrive, and returning such a large, heavy item is difficult, and the baby's arrival is imminent, we did our best to fix the damage with glue (it wasn't a structural problem, just a piece of the front bottom was torn off). It looks terrible of course and we will probably have to replace this sooner than originally planned since the damage is on the bottom and could cause scratches or splinters when the baby is crawling. But, as they say, you get what you pay for -- a cheap, particle-board changing table."
16517,1,"Talk about the toxic chemicals leaching into baby formula from plastic bottles ! To be 100% safe, we chose the old, classic, EvenFlo glass bottles to protect our baby. These arrive with the slowest flow nipple. When baby is older, you can heat up a needle/hat pin to make a second hole, or buy a whole new set of nipples. I get a really good feeling seeing the glass come really clean in the dishwasher. (Plastic just gets more and more cloudy.)Amazon gives you lots of choices on how to purchase glass baby bottles. Before you order, consider the free shipping available on the 3 packs, compared to the cost of shipping on larger packages."
84867,0,"We were very excited to get this crate and have it for our labrador. We pulled it out of the box and started to assemble it only to discover that the holes where screws go through had the wicker wrapped through them! We would have had to cut the wicker and somehow glue it to keep it from unraveling in order to access the holes. Back to the store it goes.UPDATE: We decided to use wire on the defective holes to put the crate together rather than pay to ship it back and honestly, it is a really nice crate. It's pretty, sturdy and our lab like's it much more than the wood one (she was chewing it badly but after 5 nights in this one she hasn't touched it, I think she likes the open front better). The latch does seem a little weak but it's holding up so far. All in all, it looks nice, my dog likes it, so it got upped 2 stars."
15726,1,This has been a godsend. Our son was born in Sept. 2009 and we have had this on his carseat since October. We don't have to worry about trying to put him in a coat and hoping to god the straps fit over him. I walk with him daily (even when it's 20 degrees) in his stroller and when we get home he still toasty warm. This is a great product and I plan to buy the toddler version as well!
58817,1,"This is a wonderful product. At first I wasn't sure that I really needed a microwave sterilizer and figured I could just use the dishwasher or just boil bottles and nipples. I got this as a shower gift and LOVE it soo much!! In about 4 min and 7oz of water, I can sterilize abt 7-10 4 oz bottles and nipples (that's what my baby is drinking out of currently). I just wash my bottles and nipples and throw them in this thing and put them in the microwave. As long as it is sealed, the things stay sterlized!! It's great :) Definitely a must have for any busy mom!"
137262,1,"My husband and I bought this stroller and carseat combo over a year ago and have literally taken it around the world. It has been more than worth the money! The stroller is the perfect size for easy travel and the back reclines all the way for our daughter to sleep in. A feature We have been excited about many times! It is easy to open and close with 1 hand and fits easily in my tiny VW Jetta trunk. The sunshade is large, although it is slightly lopsided and I do kick the wheels at only 5'4"". This stroller is lightweight and easily portable for someone on the go! Would highly recommend it and have to all my friends already!"
181399,1,Love this car seat. It is a top rated car seat and Amazon offered the best deal. It was easy to install and the product's reputation is A++.
125130,1,"though it resembles a biba (pacifier) a little bit, it definitely isn't one. my poor daughter saw this and immediately put it in her mouth like a pacifier and it's just way too big for that. also, it doesn't chill well. but it's great for when she wants to chew on something all over (like the handle)."
68441,1,This blanket is very soft and the picture doesn't do the color justice. I ordered the Wasabi/Coccoa butter for a baby John Deere nursery and the colors are fabulous!
88685,2,We always bought members mark diapers (we were very happy with them) until we found out about amazon mom. So I thought pampers would be the best. Not so much. They're flimsy diapers. They were always showing his booty and always leaking.
108677,0,"We bought this mobile for our son due in 7 weeks. When we went to attach it to the crib, the &quot;mouth&quot; was not wide enough to fit the crib slats on our sons &quot;convertible birth -?&quot; crib. We will have to take this mobile back and purchase a different mobile."
164722,1,"Well, they work for us. The price under the Subscribe and Save makes it cheaper to have them delivered from Amazon than to buy them at my local Walmart."
3099,2,My baby hates this even though he loves being swaddled. Definitely the worst baby product I've purchased.
44914,1,Very easy to use. Extremely effective. Kept it to use it again someday !! Hands down the best pump ever ( have used others). Well worth the money !!!!
127975,1,One of the good things about this brush is that it can stand on its handle. That means you can avoid the bristles from touching the dirty kitchen counter or worse rolling to the floor.It is sturdier than their other bottle brush because there is no foam at the tip that can get detached. But it is the same reason why I prefer the other cheaper Munchkin product. The foam at the end helps to clean the bottom of the bottle much better. This one is all bristlesAlso the handle is almost at the middle which gets in the way when brushing the taller bottles. The handle scratches the mouth of the bottle.
66509,1,"When our preschooler got too big for her portacrib, we didn't know what to do about traveling. She wasn't ready to sleep in a bed by herself, and if she slept with us... she slept, but we didn't. The best thing about this bed is that my daughter would rather sleep in it than in bed with us. Yay! You can't put a price on that!"
94295,1,"When my daughter was born 6 years ago I had a close friend who always swore by these bottles. Anyway I never tried them then but decided to move my colicky 3 month old onto them from Dr Brown's as we are travelling overseas and the Dr Brown's leak as well as having too many pieces to clean making them a hassle to travel with. We really like them and think that they are great! I like it that they have an intermediate nipple between the newborn slow and fast flow. They have leaked once but as my husband pointed out, as with any o ring if there isn't some moisture to lubricate it when fitting the two pieces together it will leak. Also with heating it up without removing the ring it allows for pressure to build up around the o ring and therefore cause leakage that way. I am happy with them and will continue using them. We also love the Avent Steam Sterilizer, what bliss! Well worth the $70!"
154101,1,"These baby wipes are great - they are free of dyes, perfumes, and are bleach free. This is also a great value - these wipes end up costing less than what you would pay for regular wipes that are full of junk at a grocery store. I was a little apprehensive about buying a 12-pack at first, but now actually love it - I never run out!"
36268,1,"I sent this to my brother for the birth of his first baby. I ordered it based on the other reviews I read, and let me tell you, it was a smart move. Although I haven't actually seen it yet, he called me and couldn't say enough about how beautiful it was...he also told me ""I shouldn't have spent so much"" because it was so well crafted it was ""obviously expensive."" I feel totally comfortable recommending this product."
35176,1,My 6 month old got his first diaper rash and this helped heal it so quickly that it was markedly better within a day. I just didn't notice when I purchased this that they wasn't the all natural formula.
37698,0,"The item works fine as a placemat for the dinner table. For the price, I was assuming it was going to have a harder backing. I found same kind of flexible plastic ones at Target for 2.99."
24675,1,"I bought this gate for my 10 month old and our cats, when they come over. The cats can jump over it but my son stays safe. The gate worked wonderfully. Easy to use, stayed in place. After less than a week of the cats (weighing less than 10 lbs.) jumping over it (they would push off the top of the gate to get over) the plastic hinge broke. We had the gate for 5 months. It only has a 90-day warranty so now it's pretty useless. I would still say this is a great gate, just don't put repetitive pressure on the top because the plastic hinges can't handle much at all."
36380,1,This pillow has provided me with the support needed during my pregnancy. I bought it in my second trimester and I have used it almost every night. We call it my cocoon. The only downfall was not so much cuddle time with the hubby. With the Relaxin my hips didn't hurt nearly as much. This was the best purchase I have made since my pregnancy.
136061,1,"This monitor is by far the best baby item we have. I love that I can sleep at night, and the monitor will alert me if my son stops breathing. We have been using it for 4 months, and have had no false alarms. You just have to remember to turn it off when you pick up the baby! I did not have this monitor with my first child, and I sure wish that I had. It is a must have for any new mom who worries about sids, whether this is your first or your fifth baby. Well worth the added expense. Don't even mess around with other monitors, just get this one and get some sleep! By far the BEST ITEM I own for my baby."
54426,1,"When my daughter was in the NICU for two days post-birth, a baby in the crib near her had this toy. It worked perfectly, and my husband and I could see just how stimulating and varied the toy was. It jiggles, it wiggles, it plays 15 minutes each of different classical composers -- marvelous! We quickly went out and bought one for our own daughter. Alas, the one we brought home had a horrible, grinding squeak. We tried to WD40 it, but to no avail. Friends who also bought the same mobile had the same problem. We used it anyway -- the grinding squeak wasn't that loud, and our daughter loved to watch it go round and round. Now that she's older, we've snipped the stuffed animal portions off and she plays with them in her crib. Also, it is designed to become &quot;just&quot; a music box when children are too old for mobiles, and that is what it has become -- minus the squeak! I do highly recommend this toy so long as you don't mind having to possibly return one or two defective ones. As someone else noted -- the company's quality control could be a lot better."
125780,2,This pump does not work. It's suction is very low. It is hard to clean and takes an hour to get about 2 oz. of milk. I'm the father of the baby and I'm writing this because my wife is very upset with the pump. She hates it and now I will have to buy a new one. Thank you Avent for creating fake reviews to sell your pump. Very clever.
85171,1,"Love this pillow!! It really relieved most of the problems I was having sleeping while pregnant. It is a little hot to sleep in as other reviewers have said but if you have a fan, thermostat, or otherwise - that's adjustable. I'd recommend this to any of my prego friends who are having trouble sleeping!!"
9144,2,"I registered for this cd player but never even used it. Upon putting my crib together, we quickly realised it wouldn't work with our Baby Italia crib, the clip is not big enough.Be sure to try it in the store before you buy it."
52212,0,"I just got these for my almost three-year old who is growing out of her current overnight diapers. It seemed like from the product description and other reviews that these might fit her, and I liked the idea of them because they're ""like underwear"" meaning she would be able to put them on and off by herself. I just go them in the mail and they're huge. There's no way that my daughter can wear these to bed without leaking. She normally wears 3T clothes, and size 4/6 underwear. I got the small size of Goodnites. I think these were made for older children who have special needs, not toddler/preschoolers working on potty training."
7408,1,"I just put this together and it was not the easiest thing being 9 months preggo but I did get it. It takes forever to get that BT bar off (this is taken off if not using Baby Trend carseat), it took me forever to get it unscrewed but once I did I followed the directions for the Snug Ride (graco) and it was very easy to move the snap bar up to the number ""I"" position. I think it could lock a little better but if you strap the carseat down, it works fine. I even turned it over and the carseat stayed in place. I think this will be a very handy thing to have once baby is here. The travel system is little too much for me! Too heavy and takes up too much room. This is all you need till baby moves out of the infant carrier!Plus, it has drink holders, can't get better than that!"
34856,2,"I was extremely excited about this car seat and thrilled when my parents purchased it for us on the birth of our first child. When he started to our grow his infant seat from his travel system, I decided to break this car seat out for our second vehicle. My husband is deployed to Iraq so I had to install it myself, which is not a problem as I'm pretty handy. Well, TWO days later, un-answered emails to the manufacturer (Dorel Juvenile Group, Inc., http://www.djgusa.com/indexDJG.asp), visits to www.nhtsa.dot.gov (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), www.seatcheck.org to find someone to HELP me with the installation, and 3 phone calls to the California Highway Patrol and Orange County Sheriffs Departments told me this was not worth the investment. On the last phone call to the Sheriffs department I was able to talk to an exceptional Deputy who told me that the manufacturer, surprise, had made the LATCH strap too short, thus answering the mystery as to why I couldn't get one side to snap in. He indicated sometimes you could get an ADULT to sit in the seat and the weight would bring the seat down just enought to bring the strap close enough to the LATCH hook to snap on, but sometimes it's simply too short and you must use a lap belt (thus defeating the LATCH system purpose.) I am thoroughly disappointed in this car seat; besides the extremely difficult installation, and defective LATCH strap (manufactured too short) the instruction booklet included was so difficult to read I tried to figure it out visually WITHOUT the book.I would have spend more time talking to friends about their experiences and made a different purchase if I had to do it all over again. Buyer beware."
79818,1,I registered for this thinking that I could use it for overnight trips. I actually used it the first two weeks after I got home from the hospital. I had an unplanned c-section and the bassinet I got required me to get out of bed and stand up in order to pick up my baby. This snuggle nest was my saving grace. I didn't feel comfortable enough having my newborn sleep right next to me but I felt he was much safer being in the snuggle nest. I will still bring this with me for overnight trips since it is so light. I also love the little battery operated night light it comes with. I've attached it to my bassinet and turn it on for the occasional nightly feedings rather than fumbling around in the dark trying to put the bottle in my baby's mouth.
134912,0,"We installed this gate at the top of the stairs, and really liked it until it broke. The plastic ""hinges"" have cracked and broken. We are hoping to find replacement parts, since this is the only gate that we have found that fits in our stairway. We do not want to pay another $100 for a new gate. I would suggest that if you want to buy this gate, get it at a store that will sell you an extended warranty, so when/if it breaks they will replace the gate."
84449,1,This product is so Fantastic!! since I got it my daughter has been very happy!! she enjoys every day!! even you can use it to make them sleep.
65622,1,"I wasn't sure how these would fit my 16 month old girl who is really petite for her age (&lt;20 percentile for weight). Even though they are nowhere close to a snug fit on her, they have never come off. We used them in the beach and in the water during our vacation. They also work great for when she goes into our backyard because its very easy to get the dirt off of these. These work better than her slippers because of the additional cover for her feet."
149380,0,This is a nice assortment and nice products but very small quantities. There is not enough of each product to get a good idea of if you want to buy more or not.
172247,2,"This seat is the most terrible seat for a 7 month old. my parents bought this seat for my daughter thinking that because it was a safety first product, and the weight limit started at 5 & a half months of age or when a baby can sit on their own this should be fine, well it's not. If your baby is tall & slender your baby is more likely to slip right out of that seat regardless of whether or not there is a bar in the front of the seat. My daughter just arched her back for a second, the next thing I knew 2 of us were grabbing her arms & waist to keep her from slipping out of the tub. It is too big, it should probably be used for a toddler age child instead. Not a 7 month old, even if she or he can sit by themselves which my daughter can."
168649,1,"I couldn't believe how huge the size 1 diapers seemed on my baby when we transitioned to them from the newborn size. A friend of mine gave me a few of these size 1-2 and they fit perfect! you cannot get them in stores (except for maybe Sam's Club, if you're a member) so i was very happy to have found them on Amazon. If you are looking for a diaper that is in between the newborn and size 1--this is it!"
2777,1,"I purchased the regular Boppy first. I misunderstood the description and thought it had a removable cover which it doesn't. It is washable but you put the whole pillow in the washer/dryer. The directions say to dry it with a green tennis ball (strange). I decided to return it and get the Boppy Luxe which does have a removable cover. I like the fabric much better too. It is soft and warm whereas the regular Boppy material is more scratchy.Although I haven't used this product as much as I thought I would, when I have used it it's been great. It's good to remember to use it for those long, sleepy nursing sessions in the evenings. Keep a book by you...I've found I can nurse and read at the same during these long dozzy sessions. Since she's been 3 months old I have occassionally put her in it like a little seat and play with her. She likes this for short periods."
176038,0,Very nice album not anything super special. Very nice for a album nothing else to say really. Sucks the fabric will get dirty and can't be cleaned very easily.
134166,1,"Like other reviewers, I thought this was a frivolous item until my son was born and screamed whenever a cold wipe touched him. This has definitely made diaper changes more pleasant, but not necessarily effortless. It doesn't seem able to heat through an entire pack of wipes so each time we open it, we have to flip the stack over and use the wipe that was at the bottom and is warmest. Maybe putting less than a pack in at a time (like one reviewer suggested) would help. It does keep the wipes moist and there is no browning, as promised. No problems with water leakeage so far. Also, it holds a smaller refill pack, so we have to wait until it is completely empty before we put in a new pack."
2201,0,We used pampers almost exclusively when our son was born and they were great. Now that he is 1 I find that the sticker tabs come off too easily and he has too much pee for them. We have started using the Kirkland diapers from Costco and they are MUCH better...and cheaper!
85955,1,"We had other, more conventional monitors, but as my son co-sleeps with us, we wanted to be able to keep an eye on him if we couldn't be in the room with him, as he falls asleep before us. This monitor has freed up our lives, and we will never part with it. As a bonus, you can buy an extra camera through the manufacturer, and set it up in another room... that way you can use one channel for one room, and the other for another (like if you have two kids!). THe color feature isn't that great, but that isn't a big deal for me. Also, the night feature is excellent; it casts no ambient lighting in the room at all, but works perfectly. Buy this monitor!"
113902,1,"This is the very best chair for babies and toddlers, especially at Grandma's house. It is so easy now for my little ones to be part of the family sitting at the table. Very easy to clean and store. It replaces having a high chair. Wish I had this raising my children."
118156,1,I purchased this TV guard when our 18 month old continued to turn the tv on and off. It works wonderfully. It sets up in seconds and has prevented her from playing with the TV and believe me she tried everything. The remote control still works perfect with the guard in place. I just ordered 2 more for our other tv's.
81323,2,"This kit does have a lot of useful items, but they are not high quality and don't all work properly. For instance, the nasal aspirator was nearly impossible to squeeze rendering it useless. The nail clippers got rusty after being exposed to boiling water.The measuring spoon with the stopper was helpful in drop feeding my son for a couple of days.Overall, I'd rather spend a bit more and buy higher quality items individually."
56702,0,"I've discovered that our open-floor-plan house is a nightmare when a toddler is thrown in. I thought it was great that my desk is in our open loft and I'm motivated to keep it neat because it's impossible to close a door on it. Well, my toddler has discovered the joy of opening file cabinets and throwing all my files down the nearby steps. And what was I thinking when I bought a file cabinet and a desk without drawer locks on them?We had to have a lock that would keep the drawers closed since he can slip files and papers out through a little crack. So we bought this system. I can't comment on installation since my husband did it. He's pretty accomplished at this sort of stuff, but he definitely got very testy and mad at the instructions, so I'll hazard that it's no cakewalk. One file drawer was hopeless and still has no lock on it. That one has only a 1/2"" strip at the top above the files and it's just not big enough for mounting a lock.We do have locks installed on a set of file drawers and a desk cabinet. The one on the desk cabinet works. No one can open the door without the key. It can be hard to get the key to engage, though. But the file cabinet is a disappointment. I keep forgetting that I need a key and just pulling them open. And they open with just a slight hitch. My toddler is quite capable of pulling this hard. Due to the physics of drawers, it takes a much stronger device to hold a drawer closed than a cabinet.And the unlock bar? It does nothing, simply nothing. I've been trying all the locks with it in every position and I see no difference at all."
47556,1,"I originally wanted this when my daughter was born but didn't wanna shell out the money since we had a play n play. My son was born 7 weeks ago and he's been a very fussy baby, he does have a little reflux . I've tried every baby product under the it feels like to get him to sleep..the rock and play, swings, positioners. What worked the best was him in our bed, I loved it since he was close by and easy for me to breastfeed. Poor hubby slept on the edge of the bed..guess we were bed hogs lol anyways our bedroom is small and the pack n play is just too large. I happened to find this on clearance at babies r us for $60.xx yes you heard me lol so I couldn't pass it up. Let me tell you it's the best 60 I have ever spent. I love that my son can still sleep next to me and it's easy for breastfeeding. The mini is perfect for small bedrooms, I love the storage underneath it...I currently have the rock n play, bumbo, and some other random baby stuff shove in it lol. I read another post saying their baby almost suffocated, my son moves around a lot I find him in some random positions, he's not once had an issue in this. I don't think I would use it past 4 months though due to it being on the smaller side and it's not high enough for babies who are pulling up.Overall i would recommend this. Oh and It's a quick set up too took me less than 5 minutes to pop up. My only draw back is I wish it had 4 wheels so you could move it around. It comes with two that lock but I would have loved it with 4 just so it's easier to roll to rooms."
10959,0,It works out okay but if you have a toddler that like to get in the chair theirselves it not so great. We have the taller kitchen chairs and when our 2yr old would try to get on it it would slip right off the chair. It needs some kind of grippers on bottom.
111276,1,Purchased for a shower gift. I compared with same product in retail shops and this was less expensive. I would definitely purchase other baby/mother items from Amazon.
75551,1,Bought this changing table for my daughter. She loves it. She bought the matching 5-drawer dresser and loves it also. Good choice. Plenty of space.
56863,1,"I bought this to keep my dogs out of the kitchen and I love it! It's sturdy enough for my husky yet so simple to use. I didn't want to attach anything to my door jams so I didn't use the mounting cups that came with it, you don't need them. It took me 10 minutes, start to finish to install and I didn't need any tools. I like the fact that the gate swings both ways, closes behind me if I need it to and it can be set so that the gate stays open when I want to give the dogs free range. I wish that I would have bought one sooner."
174683,1,"My previous Medela Advanced Double Breast Pump was finally starting to go, so I purchased this travel backpack. I have to say that, even though this product is from 2004, I really like it. It pumps just as well as my newer pump did when it was working, and it gives me more control over the suction speed (something my other pump didn't do). I am so impressed, I wanted to leave a little review in case any of you are looking to buy this pump second-hand. Don't let its age fool you - it's a hard worker!"
173567,1,"We got this swing based on the good reviews and it has turned out to be a good purchase. Our 2 mo old son likes the swing. When he gets really fussy, putting him in the swing often calms him down and he'll fall to sleep in it. It's something we would recommend to other parents."
154831,2,I have four orange cheek finches and they are extremely messy eaters. This clean cup didn't do any good for them to eat with less mess. I found that the best way to avoid mess is to feed them at the bottom of the cage with seed guards. None of the clean cups I tried have been working for these particular small birds.
69941,2,"while the heart-shaped tube is awfully cute, the plastic base that it sits upon is really flimsy and cheaply made. the bottom (underneath) is made of basically cardboard, and it was already somewhat buckled when i took it out of the package--it doesn't even sit flat on a shelf. also, the piece of ""metal"" included that you can have monogrammed is not impressive, either. sorry to be negative, but i'm just being honest!"
177983,1,"This gym is perfect for my little girl. The motion activated singing and lighted dragonfly entertains her for hours. The mat works great for tummy time. She was resistant to tummy time until we got this mat, and then she was entertained by the different textures and colors on the mat and now she does tummy time very well, rolled over at 3 months. The colors on it are bright enough to draw her eye. Overall a lifesaver for me."
155282,1,"Our daughter Reagan loves this seat. She falls asleep everytime we put her in it. It has very comfortable foam padding. It is easy to take out and install and adjust the straps. I love the padded covers over the straps that keep them from cutting into her skin. Maybe a little pricey but I was told it is suppose to be the ""cadillac of car seats"". Britax also has some of the best safety reviews of any seat and you can't put a price on safety. Also it is a good way to start your little Bama fan off right."
166156,0,"This is a good diaper for the most part. I do like that they are thin so they don't take up much room in the diaper bag, nor do they make my child's rear end ""puffy"". I do, however, have an issue with them overnight. I suppose my baby is a heavy wetter compared to most, or at least I'm assuming, because she wakes up soaked every morning. I change right before I lay her down and that diaper is SO full and leaking. Very unhappy with that, but I don't know what else to do."
13867,1,These drop ins are great. They make filling the bottles and cleanup a lot easier. If the bottles they are made for were easier to push the air out I would be completely sold. In order to ease my guilt from the damage to the environment I just rinse them real quick and throw into the recyling bin. Overall these are a great product.
125001,2,My other children loved jumping in their jumper but this one stinks! It doesn't go anywhere. My son can only jump as high as his little legs push him - he doesn't even get off the ground. It's as if they are trying to make it too safe for babies. They've taken all the bounce out of it. Boring!
143970,1,Bought to use with the Dreambaby Retractable Gate. It works great and prevents the bannister from being damaged from screw holes.
174771,1,"I just recieved this product in the mail today and have yet to use it, but I love the look and size. I am using a dresser top as a changing table and have not been able to find a changing pad to fit it till I found this one, which fits perfectly! It seems very soft and safe for the baby with the round contouring all the way around the pad, and not just on the 2 sides. I am not sure how a regular changing pad cover will fit yet, but I am sure it won't be anything bad enough to change my mind about how awesome it is. I am sure my little guy will find it very comfortable when he gets here."
95536,1,I have looked at all the competing products and this one is by far the best. Great quality and it does exactly what it says! I concur with all of the other good reviews.
40512,1,This jumbo box of diapers is so convenient!! It gets shipped right to your door and the price is comparable to any store around. What's better than not having to lug a big box home from the store and knowing you have a good supply of diapers on hand?
163686,2,I thought this space saver seat was a great idea but I'm better off putting a chair away and buying a standard high chair. I've only used it for a week so far but im ready to burn it. the straps are annoying....the color is wayyyy off. It looked bright and cheery online but its more like 60's puke green. gross! forget about trying to put the tray on with one hand. I can't even get it on with two! maybe my chair is defective? I hate it. oh! one more thing....the cover is only air dry! ugh!update!-----------still hate it!!!!!!!!!!! wondering if i have an older model??? this chair actually had arms in the air....they wobble like mad when trying to put the tray on....such a pain. i went to babies r us to check out all of the other high chairs.....the one in the store doesnt have these annoying arms!!!!!!!!! ugh. time to make a phone call to fisher price about this chair.....the horrible baby monitor the battery eating crib toy and im sure theres more. im done with fisher price! DONE!!!!!!!
60473,1,I love this tub &amp; so does my daughter. Sofia has been having baths since she was 21 days old. Thank god for whoever designed the built in seat without one like this I would feel very unsafe giving my daughter a bath. Now she is 4 months old &amp; loves bath time to splash the water with her feet.The only problem I have is storing the tub. Its very large but good enough for baby to grow into using.
12150,1,"Throughout different stages of my pregnancy I have tried using body pillows, bed pillows, and even throw pillows to get comfortable. By the end of month 8 these were all too much pillow to support the weight of the baby- they ended up just putting strain on other parts of my body and not really providing the support I wanted for the baby. I bought this pillow on a whim and it is the BEST pregnancy accessory I have bought! It is small, which is why I like it. It fits nicely under my belly and depending on how close it is to my body it provides light to strong support. I am tall and near 180 lbs (month 9) and I do not think this is too small- it supports only what I need it to (the baby) and doesn't push the rest of my body into awkward positions. I highly recommend this!"
33615,1,"These are the best pullups for my heavy bedwetter. It is difficult to find these in size L-XL in my local brick & mortar stores, and this is a better deal anyway."
63051,0,"The item works as advertised. It arrived in a factory sealed package, but it is not made by Medela. Amazon should not list this item as ""BY MEDELA"""
114738,1,Bought this for when our grandson visited because our son and daughter in law had one. Easy to set up and adjust. Very secure and keeps child in place. Make sure there is a wall in back of chair because child can use his legs to push the table and push the chair over.
177083,1,We have a huge opening between our kitchen and living room and needed something to block it off. I did a lot of reasearch and was surprised to find that there are not a lot of products to fit such wide spaces. This gate however is perfect! We purchased this and one extension. Laid out flat/straight this would be long for our walkway but I feel it can be bent/configured to fit any space (not always attractive though!) The area to step through can be narrow at times but it is not a deal breaker. We originally purchased this from amazon.com but it arrived damaged. We found it a short time later at Buy Buy Baby (phew!). The gate is a extremely sturdy and seems to be not only kid proof but adult proof at times too! The only thing I don't like about this gate is that the white plastic handle to open the gate gets dirty/stained fairly quick.
76902,2,"This is my third child, and third swing. I have had a traditional swing, another cradle -n- swing, and this one. My favorite was the fisher price cradle -n- swing, but it was an older model ocean wonders that I don't think they sell any more. It was slightly different from their current ocean wonders model.1.) The Papasan cradle swing that we have swings WAY too fast. As my baby has grown her weight has slowed it down a bit, but even at 16 lbs, it still swings too fast.2.) Additionally the motor makes a clunk, clunk with every time it reaches the height of its swing (when it changes direction).3.) The automatic timer for the lights and butterflies turning goes off too fast.4.) The toy tray is difficult to remove and put on, but it has to be removed to put her in the swing. (I've pinched my fingers several times removing it.)5.) The seat does not incline enough for an older baby to be happy playing in it. She is 4 months old now and wants to sit up, and the seat is too reclined for her in its upright position.6.) The headrest pillow should be removable, not just adjustable. In any position, it has always seems to just push her head unnaturally forward, so I ended up just cutting it off.7.) Yes, it has several songs, but it always starts on the same songs, so she hears the first few songs a LOT more than she hears the last few.It is not a horrible swing, it's just that there are a LOT of swings out there in this price range. I am sure that you could find one that does not have some many annoying features. The worst of the flaws is that it swings way too fast, especially when she was first born (and she was almost 9 pounds)!"
20744,2,I used this product exactly as directed and it melted my tubing. What a nightmare. I immediately ordered replacement tubing to be shipped via overnight mail. Not happy.
49644,1,I bought this to make my full sized Superyard bigger. The super yard products are sturdy and easy to use. Excellent for small dogs and children (I've used them for both)
27727,1,"We bought this stroller over a year ago. The first one we got actually broke (the front wheel) but we sent it back and got the second one. I like this stroller because it is very easy to maneuver when the front wheel isn't locked. It doesn't go through some doorways at stores, etc. very easily, but it is a great general purpose stroller especially for walks. The price is good and this is an overall good stroller. It does fold up easily but it is a little difficult to put into our car's trunk, but it is a double stroller so I don't expect it to be too compact."
167565,1,"We love the Compass seat. First we got it for our son at 5 and every time he wasn't in the car, my 4-year old wanted to sit in it. We had her in the Marathon. But as she continues to grow, it was a great time to transition them both to the booster seat.We love the cup holders, arm rest, and fun colors for their preference. I like that it supports their back and neck more than some of the little square blocks we have seen.We are happy with it and I also like how it folds in half for easy carrying when needed."
173093,1,We bought this and another seat saver to do a comparison and this protector won. We needed it for a heavy carseat that we use for our granddaughter that is 3 years old. While this is a stiff product that is exactly what we were looking for. No permanent indents with this protector!! We have already recommended this to our son for his newest addition.
108066,2,"I purchased this pump in good faith,The way its described it sounds fenomenal.When i got it it doesnt work!!i thought that with the price etc it be good &amp; would function.NOPE what i wound up using which works excellently is the Hospital given FREE one!This pump has no pressure whatso ever BAD!also the return policyis non existent so you get stuck with THIS LEMON!"
89941,1,They keep the stuff where it needs to be if you know what I mean and that is what I was looking for...
151440,0,"We recently bought a puppy and needed 3 gates to keep the dog on the kitchen tile floor during its house training period. Circumstances resulted in my buying 3 different brands from Amazon. There were significant differences observed that will be interesting to both child and dog owners. Rather than naming the others here I will focus on the Dreambaby.Pros: Solid metal construction. Pretty easy to install, much like all similar brands. Twist a large knob in 4 places. Latch was easiest but not the most secure configuration out of 3 brands. Quite easy by simply lifting up on one end of the gate itself, but the strategic nose of a dog or a lucky maneuver by a child might allow it to escape. Also swings shut automatically. Has a lock to make it secure. Just don't forget to unlock and fall over the thing. Another brand was secure, but often took two hands to open latch. You had to put down anything you were carrying to wrestle with it. Still another brand was both easy and secure, and was my favorite.Cons: Quite adequate except a slight concern that it is so easy for adult humans that it might be opened by a little creature if not locked. I like it for our puppy and for the wide doorway it fits.Summary: Adequately made, easy to use, inexpensive, easy latch, good for small dog or child."
170777,2,"I PURCHASED THE BASSINET PACK 'N PLAY WITH FULL SIZE BASSINET AND EVEN THE MATTRESS SHEET THAT CAME WITH IT DID NOT FIT. IT WAS SHORT BY 2&quot; ON ALL SIDES. THE MEASUREMENTS TO THE BASSINET MATTRESS IS 29&quot; X 42&quot; AND THANK GOD I SEW BECAUSE I HAD TO MAKE MY OWN SHEETS WITH OLD SHEETS MY MOM AND I HAPPEN TO HAVE AROUND. I WISH I COULD HAVE JUST PURCHASED A FEW TO GET BY TO BEGIN WITH BUT HAD TO FIT THAT IN THE LAST WEEKS OF MY PREGNANCY.GREAT PRODUCT, TOO BAD THERE ARE NOT DIFFERENT SIZED OF SHEETS TO MATCH THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF BASSINET MATTRESSES IN DIFFERENT MODELS."
42215,0,"We've used 6 different carriers now: Baby Bjorn, ERGObaby, Moby, Beco Baby Gemini, Aprica side carrier, and S.P.O.C. (simple piece of cloth).We got our Moby as a hand-me-down in good condition. I had to look up a video on YouTube to learn how to use it. At first, I only had the Moby and the Baby Bjorn, so I would resort to the support of the Moby when the Bjorn would start hurting my back. The Moby is rather complicated, enough so that my husband doesn't use it at all. Right now, we aren't really using our Moby, as our son likes to face out, and we use our wonderful Beco Baby Carrier Gemini - Metro Black for that. I do plan to use my Moby at the Renaissance Fair, so I look less modern (as I would with my other carriers)."
122051,1,"The Snugli is a great quality product. My friend gave me a Baby Bjorn carrier, but I like this one much better. At first it seems like the straps are complicated, but after a couple uses it is simple to use. My husband and I can both adjust the carrier to fit our different sizes. The hip strap is one of the main features that make this carrier so much better than Bjorn. The hip strap (like a backpack) helps to distribute the weight and gets some of it off of your shoulders. I also like the fabric allot better than the Bjorn which quickly gets worn looking. My baby (a preemie, now 4 months) likes to ride in the carrier facing in, but loves riding in it facing out. This is a great buy."
92823,0,"The deliver speed is good but over packing. Online store need to think a green and environmental friendly for shipping.My friend love the little gym. After baby grow out of it, it can be use for lazy Susan for dinning table."
57345,1,second one i've bought for my little monkey on the way in April my daughter loves them and is looking forward to using them
63345,1,It is a good toy for babies. My 4 mounth old son like to play with it and it helps him with is balace. I'am very please with my purchase!
9243,1,"I love this potty. The only problem with it is that I only ordered one! I have twin boys who are 15 months, and after purchasing this potty, I realized I needed 2. I went and bought a different brand at a local store and did not like it. The splash guard made it uncomfortable for my boys to sit on and the seat was so small I didn't think they could go 1 and 2. I took it back and got a another brand and still was not happy. I will be purchasing at least one more. This potty is perfect for my boys!"
56776,1,"Easy to clean which is a very important function. I have twins and just bought ""another"" companies potty to keep in the car and I HATE IT! I wish now I bought 2 of these potties."
2988,2,"Unfortunately the bouncing mechanism is not strong enough to bounce the baby's entire body. When my 9 lb. baby was in there only her feet were bouncing. It did not create the same feeling that she gets when I bounce a ""regular"" bouncer with my foot. A huge disappointment! I returned it."
29082,1,"First off, I have to say that this is a fantastic running stroller once you get it up and running. I have had a swivel wheel running stroller before and it just didn't cut it when I really wanted to run. This stroller is no frills but plenty of space for my almost-two-year-old and storage space for me. The mistake I made was not reading the instructions carefully. I had read several reviews about alignment problems and blew them off as a just a few bad products. When my stroller arrived (very promptly I might add) I glanced at the instructions to get the gist and assembled my stroller and immediately took it for a run. This was a mistake, I immediately thought I had a huge alignment problem and gave myself an arm workout trying to steer it for 3 miles. When I got home I looked at the instructions again to see if there was a mistake I made and right there it said ""note if you have alignment problems simply unhook the quick release, adjust the wheel in the opposite direction and re-tighten."" Once I did that my stroller has been perfect for the last six months and I've been running 5x a week with it."
64624,2,"For the first three months of use, I agreed with all of the other reviews. But I am now returning this bag. It has ripped in two places and I have resorted to using an oversized purse in the meanwhile. Needless to say, I'm pretty ticked off. Parents have better things to do with their time than hunt down replacements for junk that doesn't work the way it should."
4559,1,"ITEM CAME JUST AS PICTURED, FAST SHIPPING AND GREAT QUALITY! LOOKS GREAT ON MY DAUGHTER'S DOOR...WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING TO FIND A GREAT QUALITY LETTERS FOR A GREAT PRICE!"
48834,1,"I really like the play yard and bought it with soft foam mats to create a 'baby jail'. However, it is a little more flexible than I expected and my little one pulls up on everything these days. Also, there was a piece of the fence that had broken at the joint and wasn't in the box, so it must have broken before boxing. That was rather disappointing. Otherwise, it's a good play yard and serves its purpose."
133367,1,"my son will only drink from wide-necked bottles. he's been using Avent and i also love Avent bottles. however, Avent bottles, more often than not, leak. since all Born Free bottles are BPA-free, they have a vent system, are wide-necked, plus they don't leak, I was convinced these are the bottles that will work for my son and i. and i'm right. my son can comfortably hold them since he was 6 months old and it's very easy to clean. i just love them! i have tons of Avent nipples so i've been using them for my Born Free bottles."
173470,1,"This swing is a god-send. I admit that I picked it because it looked so comfy and cute. I had no idea if my baby would like it when he arrived. Well, now I know - he loves it!! From day 1 he could sit in it because the seat is reclined. Many of my mommy friends found that the seats on their swings were too upright for their newborns. In the four months since, this has been used for many hours - in fact, when my son went through a phase where he wouldn't sleep for more than an hour at a time in his crib, I put him in the swing and slept on the couch next to him. Worked like a charm! He still loves to sit in the swing - he has no trouble looking around and gets so excited about the mirror above him that he starts giggling and kicking like crazy.One thing that I thought would be a problem - batteries - really hasn't been. I didn't have to change the batteries until he was 12 weeks old! They seemed to last longer in the beginning though most likely because my son weighed much less then than he does now.I've been selling all of my pregnant girlfriends on this swing - I couldn't recommend anything more!!"
18110,1,"My daughter is 3 months and can't get enough of this play mat! She laughs and coos at the lights and music and now she is starting to kick at the toys to get the music started. It is easy to wash, too, since she tends to sometimes spit up on it. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;"
120979,1,"A year ago, I bought my, then 1 year old, twins Kushies Classic. I love them. Now these diapers I got for my new son. The diapers are easy to use and clean. These diapers are as easy to put on a baby as the disposable kind. I keep the soiled diapers in a kitchen size garage pail. I wash the diapers every 2-3 days. Since there only Kushies in the load, sorting and folding is optional. Right from the dryer, I just dump my clean diapers in the container I keep them in. The ""extra"" laundry is not a problem."
7717,1,Last summer was the first time I tried John Varvatos! It is an excellent fragrance--liked the wooden fragrance and the rich leaves that make this cologne. It's a very masculine fragrance--every man should have it in his bathroom cabinet!
33403,0,"I got this gate so I could leave my door open to get some cool night air while cooking dinner and not have to worry about my cat escaping, but he can jump right over this!"
54757,1,"After reading some of the other negative reviews, I feel very lucky with our mobile. It hasn't broken on us once (knock on wood). Our baby loves watching her &quot;friends&quot; and listening to the music. I'll hate taking it off the crib when the time comes. We love the fact that the music part can stay on the crib because the music here is wonderful. Don't be discouraged by the other reviews. This is truly a great product and your baby will love it!"
167776,0,"These sheets are really thin, to the point that you can almost see through the navy blue one. However, that works well for us in the summer. I like that they have elastic pockets on the bottom, so they usually stay on the mattress, while being flat on the sides and top so the kids can still have a sheet over them on warm nights. They do get pilled when washed, especially with other items. If you was them with a blanket, expect pills. Overall, I like them just enough, but I have looked elsewhere for sturdier sheets for fall/winter. (Yes, they can be found, usually at a store with a bullseye.)"
179327,1,I don't have a baby but I gave the bottles to a friend to use and give me feedback. Her response was good and she told me the best feature is the Micro-Channel Vent Technology that keeps air at the back of the bottle rather than mixing it with the milk. She indicated the baby burped less and noticed there was no spit-up as there was using her other bottles. She also liked the form of the bottle because it seemed easier for the baby to hold.I noticed others said the air vents leaked and were messy. I asked her if she had any issues in this regard and she said she didn't.Playtex has always made a good product and it seems the bottles are certainly in that category.
79966,2,"I have to be vigilant when my 2-year-old uses the Thermos because if he places the cannister on its side, milk will come out of the straw. He also likes to turn it upside down, and milk comes out. I bought two of them only two weeks ago, and one broke today when it fell out of his bag. The cover cracked and the hinge broke off. As a result, the cap will not stay on now. I am looking for other alternatives. Glass is out of the question with my boys!"
145058,1,"My Son LOVES this Jumperoo and I love it a bit more! This was a good investment as my son hates his swing and is very energetic and alert. He is almost four months old now but has been using this since he was seven weeks. It took him a few minutes the first time but once he realized he could jump, he went wild. I also like that this product allows baby to turn around in his seat, so I don't have to position it a certain way. You will not regret this purchase."
164175,1,"I really like this item. I put in our stroller to stop my 6month old son's head from drooping when he sleeps. It also helps keep him supported when he's awake. Occasionally he droops out of it, but overall it works great. I especially like that we can leave it in the stroller even when it's folded."
32040,1,"This bassinet liner, skirt and hood are very cute! The outside material seems a little rough and the sewing on the bow could have been done better... However, I'm hoping a delicate wash and a little extra stitching on the bow will help. I was given an older bassinet and it fits this perfectly and is cute enough that I don't want to return it!"
24695,2,"We were excited to find a good gate that we could get shipped to us(military family overseas). Thing is, it broke within the first week! The spring inside busted so it would not stay locked. It worked for a while even with the broken spring. After a while tho, our dog and daughter both figured out how to open it. :P"
6240,1,"I returned my video monitor even though it seemed to work fine. I wanted this at first thinking I would need it with my child, but so far (in 6 months) I have not really needed the video component and so never set the monitor up. We have a small house, so I can hear her really well from just about anywhere in the house. I also leave her nursery room door open enough to be able to peek in - it is just not necessary to have the video monitor. I also realized that since I would primarily be using it at night, the room would be dark, and the monitor does not seem to work nearly as well in the dark, so it would not be that useful to me. I have heard it is an advantage if your child is a realy noisy sleeper and you are bothered by hearing the sleep noises - you can then just visually check on your child without having to wonder what the noises are. But, from my experience, even when she makes noises at night you learn to tell the difference between sleep and awake noises pretty fast, so I think an audio monitor (a 20-30.00 one) would be totally sufficient.Now that my infant is rolling over at night, I am actually a lot more worried about her breathing and getting her face trapped than I was when she was littler, so I am getting the AngelCare monitor that assesses breathing and sounds an alarm if they stop breathing. I plan to use that one with any future children as well when they are newborns. It is cheaper than the video monitor and comes with an audio component as well.I think it's nice to have a monitor but if you have your child close to you in your house (like when ours was a newborn we usually had her sleeping near us in various rooms), or have a small house, or have your child in your room with you at night (ours has slept in a port-a-crib for 6 months in our room), then a fancy video monitor is not really necessary. I'll post a review on the AngelCare monitor once we get that set up and working."
59438,1,"I love this diaper depot. Prior to purchase, I thought it might be a little cheap, but it's the exact opposite. It is well made with hard thick plastic. It holds the diaper warmer on top and the side bins are great for nic-nacs like diaper cream, nail clippers, brush, etc. It stores the diapers in the middle and has slots at the bottom where you can pull the diaper out from the left side or the middle of the depot. It frees up so much space from the changing table and keeps everything organized and accessible. We have a Graco Sarah changing table and it fits perfectly on the front. This was one of the best baby items we bought along with the Prince Lionheart premium diaper warmer."
26779,1,"Same lovely Bunnykins ,similar to the ones I started my six children with many years ago.The difficulty is that one cannot choose the pattern when ordering and thus we have received duplicates. Children and grown-ups alike both have fun with the different pictures on the plates,bowls and mugs......"
25248,0,"The leg extension kit does what it says, it makes your Arm's Reach taller. That being said, I was a little disappointed with the ""fit and finish"" if you will. The kit raises the co-sleeper incrementally, which is a nice feature, but as you stack the legs higher and higher, the legs get wobblier and wobblier due to about a quarter inch of play being added with each increment. Our bed height required the maximum length provided, so our co-sleeper is a little on the wiggly side now. Of course, there are the straps that reach to the other side of the mattress and you don't exactly move the thing around while the baby's in it, so if you need a little more height to match your mattress, they are a must have."
19210,1,"We (myself and the current baby) love this Snuzzler pad. It is easy to put in place on the stroller. Our baby girl was so lost in her stroller without it because she was so tiny as a newborn. She was crying and crying. But after placing this Snuzzler on the stroller, she appeared much more peaceful and content when we go on strolls (no crying for the most part now).I made the mistake though of washing these pads and not paying attention to the washing instructions. I put in for a cold machine wash on regular cycle instead of the delicate cycle that is on the label. Big mistake. The pads are now kind of warped with the padding bunched up and not evenly spaced. So if you wash the Snuzzler, just follow instructions carefully. Don't space out and put it in along with the baby's other regular wash clothes."
13887,1,"Love Playtex. I bought these thinking they would be slightly better than the flimsy store brand ones. These are very sturdy in fact. They even hold their shape with slightly hot formula inside (heat it up before the little bugger wakes up ;). Its very easy to warm formula or pumped milk in these cos u can just swirl it in some hot water. It heats up the milk considerably faster than a bottle.The only disappointment to me was that I never noticed the crumple down effect when using these. Where its supposed to be a vacuum and the baby's sucking just pulls the milk out and the dropin just crumples. In my experience, it just acted like a bottle and held its shape till the end of the feeding. And I did use the recommended Playtex nipples, nurser, etc. So I switched over to their vent-aire bottles and those I feel are even better. But as dropins go - these are very good."
164130,2,"I purchased this item in hopes that it would help my daughter with avoiding the flat spot on the back of her head. Well, it happened anyway despite using this device everywhere. Her pediatrician said that some babies are prone to getting the flat spot, no matter what preventative measures are taken. Amazon delivered it quickly though and the price could not be beat.This item is well made and can stand up to wear and tear and many washings. This was the only place that I could even find this thing. Babies R Us had a velvet version, but I don't think that material is baby spit-up friendly."
87425,1,The Premium design helps to prevent leaking when the bottle is shaken before serving. This system also allows you to store the bottles in the refriderator with the nipple which makes it quick and easy to prepare your bottles. They come out of the refridgerator and into our bottle warmer. (The one on this site that is 9.99)
103892,0,"The flanges that came with my pump were too small so i ordered these which were the next size up and they were a little too big but ok. Even with the handsfree bra, i still had to hold them close because of the extra space. so, it didnt fit me like i needed it to, but may be perfect for the next woman of course. Sturdy and easy to clean."
91986,0,"Used this pillow religiously between my 3rd and 6th months. It helped me get used to sleeping on my side. But the pillow's filler got very lumpy and malformed very quickly, I would have used it much longer if this were not the case. Would have expected something better quality from Boppy."
81515,2,We registered for this monitor thinking that it would be a higher quality since it was one of the more expensive. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! One receiver makes a &quot;clicking&quot; sound every 5 seconds and the other one shrieks. I just wish I had kept the box to return it!
66250,1,"My son not only has acid reflux, but he is also allergic to the milk protein. When I made the switch to bottles, I tried just about every kind on the market. FINALLY I found these bottles and they have worked wonderfully. I read a review on this site about the leaking and to run your finger around the base of the nipple when putting it into the bottle, and that was VERY helpful. I haven't had any leaking since then. My son doesn't swallow any air bubbles, and is eating well thanks to these bottles."
166076,2,The baby dry diapers left a rash on my baby. Not a diaper rash another kind of rash. I will never use these again.
115248,2,"Manufacturer information states this gate can be ""pressure or hardware mounted"". Well, the gate comes as pressure mounted. There is a notice in the package informing purchaser that to hardware mount you must purchase the hardware separately at their site. Also, the supposed hardware is only an edged circle that gets screwed into wall and then the pressure mounted circle gets pressure mounted into that. I thought I was purchasing a gate that could not be removed but that is not the case with this gate. If that's what you want, purchase a different gate. I'm returning mine."
48868,1,"THIS PRODUCT IS FAIRLY EASY TO UNFOLD, HOWEVER IT DOES TAKE A BIT OF MUSCLE! THE STRUCTURE IS QUITE STURDY AND LARGE ENOUGH FOR MY SEVEN-MONTH OLD GRANDSON TO CRAWL AROUND AND ENJOY HIS TOYS. I PURCHASED ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER (HIS MOM), AND IT HAS BEEN A GODSEND FOR HER, AS WELL."
83699,1,This product was an absolute lifesaver when my newborn baby refused to latch on to my nipples and i was a strongly determined breast-feeder. But due to him not latching on i was stuck pumping for him. This was introduced to me by a lactation consultant and in a matter of 2 minutes my baby was eating from the breast. Now 9 weeks later he has started to nurse from the bare breast. Highly recommend for those struggling with breast feeding. Lifesaver!!!
140107,1,We are really pleased with our pet gate. Very surprised at the weight and sturdiness of it. We do have a small dog and it is ideal for her.
13330,1,"This nursing stool drastically improved the usefulness of my old-fashioned rocking chair as a place to nurse my newborn. Prior to the stool my lap was slanted in a way that made it difficult to position baby and my back was leaned too far back to be useful. The stool converted my lap into a flat horizontal stretch that could support my baby and improved my posture so I didn't end my sessions with a backache. However, I also found it useful while nursing on the couch or other armchairs (same benefits) and my husband loves to use it when he is getting baby dressed after a bath as it helps him keep his lap horizontal as well. An added bonus is that it is incredibly easy to put together (5-10 minutes tops) and comes with it's own allen wrench tool."
114311,1,This is a great portable high chair that is simple to use and easy to clean. It is very self-explanatory to set up and easily adjusts in a lot of different ways. It also folds down nicely with a good handle to carry it around. My 12-month-old also loves just playing with it on the floor. Highly recommended!
142589,1,"I bought this after reading about it in a couple of baby product books and after hearing of this type of pillow from a lactation consultant. It is fabulous! I have the clasp kind, not the velcro, so noise has never been a problem. My baby was a ten-pounder, which could have made it hard on a new mom's arms and back. But My Brest Friend saved me from that. I've never had any problems. I put it on first, then pick up my daughter. It doesn't get in the way. If I need to do something in between breasts, I just twist it so the large part is in back. I also have a boppy that I got as a gift. I've tried it, too, and it really doesn't begin to compare to the My Brest Friend. I'd recommend this to anyone!"
147007,1,"I purchased this playspot because it was the least garish on the market, as well as the thickest. It is also the only product I saw safety rated for kids under three. We have a ceramic tile basement where my daughter plays and the mat keeps her safe and me worry free. I have no problems with the colors; they are true to what was represented. The mat comes with a nice bag where you can store unused squares. I have no problems with dirt or dust and I have pets who have not harmed the mat at all. The squares assemble, break down, and clean easily. My only compliant (and a minor one at that) is that I don't like that the circular spots come out of the squares. It is a bit of a pain when breaking down the mat. Skip hop obviously did it that way so that you can customize the look of the mat, as it says on the packaging, which is a neat option I just wish there was a way to do that, which required less pieces! All in all and excellent product and I am glad I purchased it."
106346,0,"We initially had no problems with this product... we were so happy to not be buying expensive trash bags. However, after our daughter started eating solid foods and the poop started to have a more powerful odor, the champ was easily KO'd. We still use the champ for wet diapers, but ended up buying the diaper genie for smelly ones... so we still get the benefit of cheap plastic bags for most of our diapers, but get the smell protection of the genie."
124207,0,"It does cover the stroller and keeps the rain out, more or less. But it came out the package with a four-inch rip on one of the seams. The quality/thickness of plastic is such that unless it's treated fairly carefully, it's going to be prone to more tears along the seams."
5430,1,"I can nurse in it , stuff it in the diaper bag and it looks great. The print side works great with jeans and I flip to solid to keep it from being to much with my patterned skirts My 17lbs 3mo loves it in there and Ive even held my 27lbs 2yo ( she wants what baby gets lol)"
126865,1,"As parents of eleven children we have gone through many brands of diapers, comparing them and trying to figure out which ones worked best for us. We conclude that Huggies are our favorite. We don't have troubles with leakage or diaper rash as we did with the other off brands. We highly recommend Huggies Snug and Dry."
178044,1,"Used these to attach our North States gates to wrought iron railings. Incredibly simple to install, very sturdy! Impossible to find in stores."
122529,1,"We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby's life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don't want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it's not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can't keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don't want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more 'traditional' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that's how I'm using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it's really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The 'detailed' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it's an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn."
63742,1,"We love this high chair, it is not too big and bulky, fits well in our kitchen and is easy to use and easy to clean. We recommend it to anyone looking fora moderately priced option."
147779,0,The base of this car seat has a metal levelling ball encased in plastic that rattles and rolls around while driving which is very annoying (more to the driver than the baby). We've taped a heavy duty magnetic in place to stop the noise.
105012,1,"I thought my 11 month old would be able to pull it off, but because there are so many spots that hold it on the hearth, she can't get it off. Now I'm not worried about her cracking her head into it as much. As a bonus, it wasn't even as expensive as most sets like this I've seen. It also doesn't look bad."
115205,1,"I do like this gate. BUT, it does not close automatically, just comes near to closing. So I have to manually close it and hear the ""click"" to be sure that it is safe. I thought that it would close behind me. It COULD be that I installed it improperly but I read the directions and followed them. It did close automatically for the first week.I also wish I had bought one that could stay open when I wanted it too. It is difficult to bring the laundry through the gate because I have to use one of my hands to open the gate and balance the laundry on my hip.That all being said, I bought his exact type of gate 8 years ago and it was great. I don't know if it is made differently now or not but it looks pretty much the same as that one. So I'm thinking it just isn't made as well. I would not buy it again but I don't dislike it enough to spend money on a different one."
130392,1,"this is truly the best swing ever, we bought it when my son was a few days old because he cried constantly. He absolutely loves looking at the fish and watching the lights and the music helps put him to sleep. He loves being able to swing in both directions. Yes it does take a few batteries, but it was well worth a little peace and quiet. THIS SWING IS A MUST HAVE!"
155239,1,It is totally comfortable and roomy. One of my favorite features is the velcro on the sides of the carseat and the straps....it holds the straps to the side while you get the kid settled in. I would definitely buy one again. Only negative is that it has no cup holder. Luckily there is room in the carseat next to my son for his cup.
89672,1,Bottom line I absolutely love the product from my child and think the price is great! Amazon does a great job shipping and it is one less thing I have to put in my cart at the grocery store. Buy diapers on Amazon one of the best things I have done as a mom.
36738,0,"This pillow worked great when my daughter was starting to sit around 5 months. I could set her in this and not worry too much about her bonking her head when she tipped over. It was also great for a baby lounger for a couple months before that. As far as nursing goes, it wasn't any more useful than a normal pillow. It is too soft and flat to provide much support, and since I'm on the plus size side, it never sat right around my waist either."
133037,1,"I love the Diaper Dekor. Our baby goes thru quite a few diapers and this product helps keep her room smelling fresh. I love how easy it is to pull out the bag and start a new one. We have been home for 4 weeks and have not needed a replacement bag yet so, they last a long time."
128169,1,"After using many strollers, I truly believe there will never be the ""perfect"" stroller. This one comes close. I have twins, and originally used the duoglider tandem. Good for newborns to infants, but it sure got HEAVY after my girls started to grow. It got so heavy, it made going out not even worth it. I purchased this Combi when my girls were about 15 months. It is SO lightweight. The size is good. I can get in and out of doors okay. If the doors are not electric, than you may have to rely on a good samaritan to open it for you. There are some cons: the basket underneath is not that big. Dont expect to go shopping with it. The buckles are a little flimsy. They come undone if you are not precise with fastening it. (In my opinion, for a stroller that cost so much, this should not be an issue). There is no stroller ""handle"" for me to put my purse. The straight bar across has no opening to put something on. The sunshades creep back up when you put them down. Its kind of annoying having to readjust every 20 seconds. But for all that, my key point is that this is simple to use and lightweight and folds up three-way for room in your car. And to me, the ease of use outweighs the cons."
26196,2,"My 3 month old son loved this toy! However, one of the bunnies stopped jumping within 3 days. I exchanged it for another one which broke in 2 days. How disappointing because he loved kicking them and watching them pop up! If someone could improve on this concept I'd buy it in a minute!"
116852,1,"My husband is almost always an XL but the vest's shoulders were too wide for him, and now I have to exchange for an L. The color is not as bright as I thought it would be, which is good. We haven't had the baby yet so haven't put it to use, but I took one star back b/c it seems a tad overpriced for what it is. The changing pad is nice, but that's really the only thing that distinguishes this vest from a non-DadGear vest."
135633,1,I am a mom to be and I wanted to decorate my baby's room with the Hello Kitty theme. It really made the room so beautiful and happy. I love the stickers and they are so easy to apply. Just love them
131598,1,"We love this toilet seat. We have had ours for a couple of years now. It has seen lots of use and lots of different toilets - airports, train stations, highway rest areas, homes, schools, etc. and it has fit and felt secure on every toilet. It has never pinched my kid, and doesn't seem like it could with the little flanges that fit over the hinges. One thing to remember (and remind others who help your kids to the toilet with it) is that the handles go to the front of the toilet seat. Seems obvious, but sometimes it confuses people."
86943,1,"I used these bottles with my first child and I will definitly use them with my son who is due in 11 weeks! If you are a on-the-go parent with regular bottles, you'll have to stop and look for a water fountain to rinse out the old milk residue or milk that your baby did not finish before you can fill the bottle again. Or you may take 3 or 4 bottles with you which takes up too much room in your diaper bag. With these bottles you just pop in a new liner. They are collapsable and you can store 5 or 10 liners inside the bottle for a space saver in the diaper bag. Cute designs too!TIP: Always have a plenty of straws on hand- WHY? Stir don't shake- Little if any air stays in the bottle and that means less squeezinG and a less fussy gassy baby!TIP: If you are military, look for these bottles in the Commisary, they are so much cheaper- about $2.35 per bottle and only 12.00 for the starter gift set plus no tax of course!!!"
132293,0,"Again, I thought I was buying the whole lamp, But the shade is nice, it should go with a really small stand as the shade to is small."
74743,1,"This was THE best blanket for a swaddle, especially for our squirmy guy! We purchased our first Miracle Blanket from the manufacturer's site, but Amazon gives a better deal and includes free shipping. This paired with the Happiest Baby on the Block DVD would make an excellent shower gift. We couldn't have survived without them!"
52049,1,"I bought this carrier because my son likes to face out, and the carrier that we had does not support that. Also, he was born on the smaller side, and Baby Bjorn carriers are made to carry babies as small as 8 lbs, so we could use it comfortably sooner. My only complaint is that the shoulder straps are not very padded, so as the baby gets heavier it gets a little harder on your shoulders (this is why I gave it only 4 stars).It was delivered in a timely manner and the product was new as stated."
11035,1,I have looked everywhere for a booster seat that was big enough for my son and didn't attach to the table or have a tray. This thing is perfect for him and I know it will last a long time. It is nice and comfy and he actually likes sitting at the table with us now.Buyers Beware you may receive a different color than pictured. I ordered mine thinking I was getting blue but received the green instead. This is perfectly fine but some buyers might not appreciate this.
39321,1,"April 26, 2011Just want to add, I still love this cups. After only couple days of having it, all the straws were flat on the top (bitting issue). I tried to do what other reviewer said, use a regular straw. It works! My son loves it better with the bendable straw, make it more comfy for him to drink. Again, it's not spill proof (it drips if you flip it) but he's over that issue.March 22, 2011I don't know why I always thought this is one of those cheap items that won't work. I couldn't be more wrong.My son is 2 years old. Though he able to drink from regular cup, I want something that I can just handed to him without having constantly alarmed he would spill something. He has a thermos straw cup but sometime he just didn't want that (I'm guessing he wants something light to hold). We also have couple those spill-proof straw cup but he hates them because it makes the liquid harder to suck.Couple months ago I got him a cute snowman cup on a local store. It's not spill-proof (there's a tiny hole on the top to make sipping easy) but as long as he didn't turn it upside down, everything is fine. He loves it, until I notice the bitting issues and to fix it, I cut the straw part that's ripped. Last week it reached to point that I couldn't do anything to safe it, so here we go with searching, browsing and reading all review.I read about this one (actually the one with cute designs) and went to local store to get it (I need it quick). Though I still have so much doubt in my mind, it was cheap, only $3 for 5 of them. Nothing can go wrong with that much of money. Went home and tried it..... Voila.... my son loooves them! And I love the fact I have many of them that I can fill each cup with different beverage. And to my surprise, he even drinked more than before.I tried turning it upside down, nothing spill. Could be also because it's new, I'm guessing by time we'll have problem with that but I can always get some more. I haven't had any issue with dropping, so I don't know yet. It's marked as BPA free, that's another plus point for me. I normally don't use dishwasher, this is just what I'm thinking, I don't think the lid is dishwasher safe. Also, there's no many parts to clean up and so easy to put it together. Like the other reviewer said, make sure you put the lid on first then the straw in to avoid liquid shooting up from the straw."
43005,1,"I don't know what I would do without my Moby Wrap. I started using it while still in the hospital so I could have skin-to-skin contact with my daughter without being constantly exposed. She loved it immediately, and she sleeps very soundly in it. Now that she's 3 weeks old, I credit the Moby Wrap for enabling me to get things done. I can tidy up the house because it keeps my hands free and her securely snuggled next to me. She'll easily sleep for four hours in the wrap. If we put her in her co-sleeper, we're lucky if she stays down for 45 minutes. I even use it at nighttime so we can sleep together without me having to worry about blankets smothering her or rolling on top of her. My only advice is to buy at least two. It's a challenge in our household to only have one wrap, because it has to be washed some time -- and I'm hesitant to be without it for any stretch of time."
2634,1,I have been using these diapers on my 6 week old son for a couple of weeks now an havent had any issues with them like some people say they have. They are thinner then the swaddler dry max but I think these do there job great. I have not had any leaks with these at all. But my son is a sleepy baby and just got out of the NICU so I change his diaper every 3 hours to help wake him up. I do prefer the swaddlers dry max as I think they are a nicer and thicker diaper but if your looking for value for money these are fine.
82066,1,super cute and fuctional.do wish the bag was a bit bigger but then again it could be me having too many things to carry.
182715,2,"I bought these because my son is obsessed with Toy Story and this package claimed they were.Unfortunately, the package came with Cars on the front and Cars diapers inside. I was more thanangry, I know its crazy to buy diapers based on the photo but we were having success with potty training.This was my most regretful purchase on Amazon to date!"
61406,1,"I have to say that I am very impressed with this monitor. I can't believe that for under $20 this monitor works awesome. My son uses a fan for white noise and I thought that was going to be a problem with the monitor. Yes, you can hear the fan, but it also picks up every noise that my son makes too...without static. We also live on a half acre lot and I was able to take the monitor to the end of the lot line to do some yard work and could still hear my baby with no problems. So, if you want a BASIC monitor, I would highly recommend this one. I would have given the rating 5 stars if the parent unit used a battery other than a 9V and had a shorter antenna. I had to go out and buy a battery specifically for the monitor and the antenna makes the monitor difficult to wear on a belt."
12685,2,"A real disappointment. We got our hopes up and tried for months to hear the heartbeat. Now 29 weeks, still nothing but horrible static and every creak of the movements of the cords and my hands! impossible to avoid! If im lucky, the only thing heard over the static is my digestive system. woo hoo! anyways, this thing picks up conversations of people in the next room as well as any TV or music playing in the house. Such a let down! and we're mad that we wasted our money."
25628,2,"These are very hard plastic, they do not bend, there is nothing ""soft"" about these items.I replaced my spring type door stops with these, three days later I put the springs back.When you bump your foot against the hard plastic, it hurts, the springs would just bend.When the baby steps on the hard plastic, it rips out of the wall, the springs would just bend.I just superglued the white caps on the springs."
3220,1,"My daughter is suprisingly a very light sleeper, and would get easily startled by the lightest sounds. She'd fling her arms and hit her face and wake herself up. When she was a newborn, I bought several of these SwaddleMe's, and they really worked for her during the first few months. Especially at night they kept her asleep for a long time. Not to mention they also kept her warm during the cold winter time. The cotton ones seem to be more comfortable. I also bought some fleece ones, but I was afraid it would get too hot for her, so I didn't use them as much. I washed them regularly, and they still hold together and in good shape. I am very satisfied with the purchase."
139253,1,"I bought this product for my 7 month old daughter. My son (2) has the Twilight turtle. We have always liked the turtle, but there were some flaws. For example, the yellow did not show up on the ceiling/walls no matter where it is placed in the room, and there is no off button. So it goes through batteries because my son is constantly turning it on at all times of the day. With this being said my son will not go to sleep without the turtle. We even take it on vacations. As mentioned I bought the lady bug for my daughter. I had planned on buying her the turtle, but when I saw the bug I couldn't resist. Cloud B has made some modifications since the turtle and they are for the better. The on button is also an off button. They removed the yellow and replaced it with a red, which is to be used as a nightlight....it does not project the stars. So far I do not have any complaints."
125194,2,"My three month old daughter is an early teether and I thought this product would be perfect for her as she is still too young to consciously use teething rings and other products of the like on her own. However, it is WAY too big to even get into her mouth and probably will be for some time; it's HUGE! This product seems great in theory, but they need to make age specific sizes or accurately advertise that the RaZ-berry is not designed for young teethers. Waste of money for me."
24721,1,"was a quick assembly. my doorway has a threshold so i didn't need the included ramp. took about 5 minutes to get it out of the box and in place in the doorway, including reading the instrucions. and then, since this was to keep my dog out of the kitchen and let the cats go where they want, i cut the center bar out with a sabre saw while the gate was in the doorway. of course i voided the warranty and i'm sure the manufacturer doesn't recommend doing that, but the gate didn't move at all while i was cutting. the modification took longer than assembling the gate in the first place and of course if you do this, wear gloves and eye protection. also, i adjusted it as tightly as possible before trying this. when you think you have it adjusted tightly, use the included square headed wrench to tighten it even more. not worth the risk not to"
59094,2,"What a useless gadget. You can accomplish the same bottle-warming task in the same - or less - time using hot tap water and bowl or large measuring cup. This bottle warmer doesn't even have a timer, so you still have to watch the clock while it's heating your bottle. Depending on your bottle size, it takes 4+ minutes to warm, and you have to stay on top of it... miss your timing by a little bit and you've got scorching hot milk on your hands. My bottle warmer found its way back to Target."
134846,1,"We bought this carseat for my 2nd son (who is 9 weeks old now) and love it except for a few things. The head stabilizer that comes with the seat is not sturdy enough to support a newborn's head so we had to buy another one to hold his head upright. My son was 7 lbs. at birth and not of an unusual newborn size so I'm not sure if it just did not have enough filling in it or what. Another thing Graco should consider is selling the seat as part of a ""travel system"" instead of only the stroller and seat seperate. (just a matter of convenience) Otherwise, like I said, we love the seat and the ease of the strap adjustment."
46519,1,"I have been in the search for a guard rail for the big boy platform bed that my 2 1/2 year old grandson has begun sleeping in at my home. - nap time and occasional overnights. I had purchased and ordered a few that stated for any type of bed including platform; they DID NOT fit properly for my platform bed. I ordered the Dex Baby Earths guard rail and it is wonderful. Fits securely and is constructed with safety in mind.. The only problem I did have was that the instructions were a bit confusing.. It was easier to look at the fully assembled picture on the box. But, overall. I am satisfied with this wonderful product. I would highly recommend it."
50891,1,"While this pillow looks ridiculous and takes up a significant amount of space in our bed, I wouldn't trade it for anything (except my husband). I have a history of back pain and was regularly going to a rheumatologist in hopes of correcting or at least reducing it. Pregnancy, of course, has amplified my back pain and in my second trimester, I started experiencing more discomfort, and was losing sleep. The first night I came home with this pillow, I immediately experienced relief and slept peacefully through the night. When I woke up the next morning, my usual back pain was significantly less, and it really made me feel great to start the day. Within a couple weeks of using it every night, even my ""normal pain"" was gone. I think I might even continue to use if after we have the baby! In any case, I highly recommend this product, especially to pregnant women- there is nothing more important than getting quality rest, and this pillow definitely helps you achieve that goal."
30243,1,"Our son takes to this sometimes and other times not, but it is helpful reminding me to remind him to use the potty. It definitely reignited his interest in the potty in general. The only warning is that this toy takes LOTS of batteries. Don't pull it out like I did and get the kid all excited about it unless you have batteries for both the potty and the monkey. This was not the solution, but it was a great tool."
8752,1,Our two year old absolutely loves this seat as does his mommy! It is made of a wonderfully soft material and it is so easy to keep clean. There are no hidden areas for food to hide in. The non stick bottome keeps the booster right where you want it! We take this booster everywhere and the travel bag makes it easy to do! Our son feels like a big boy and loves his new seat. We even take it into restaurants because his cooshie seat is so much nicer than the boosters the restaurant will offer!Awesome product worth the money!
25187,1,"my twins really like this chair. however, I think that the music is not necessary. I thought that I had ordered the one without the music. The music goes off at random times, this is a bit of a let down for the child if they hear the music when they haven't done anything on the seat.Otherwise, this is a good product. It's also great as a step stool."
69060,2,"I have been a loyal cutomer to pampers for the past 20 months and have almost always bought my pampers swaddlers and cruisers from here at Amazon because they always had the best deal in town. I have stuck with Amazon even though their prices slowly crept up from $26.99 a box to now $33.49 a box and without coupons. I did so because I was so appreciative of their free shipping offer to here in Hawaii which saved me the trek across the island to the only toysrus here in Hawaii. Thus, I was so excited to see on December 1st, 2005 that you had a pampers promotion going on. I immediately attempted to buy 4 cases until I realized that you no longer ship to Hawaii. I can't even pay Amazon to ship their pampers to me because they no longer ship outside of the continental United States! Amazon, you guys were among the first to recognize Hawaii as part of the U.S. and offer shipping prices or free shipping that was the same as the rest of the continental U.S. You held back, unlike many other companies, and didn't charge ridiculous prices to mail items to Hawaii. Please reconsider shipping to Hawaii again."
120907,1,"This gate is wonderful! We have 2, one between the living room and kitchen and another from the kitchen to the hallway. I could not wait for the second gate to come! We were chasing our daughter everywhere!! It is very secure and easy to open with one hand. Plus it looks nice compared to some of the other gates I have seen.I highly recommend this gate!!"
82008,2,"I used the Medela storage bags for my 1st son and never had an issue. I bought the Lansinoh bags for my 2nd because they were a better deal and held more milk. So far, 5 bags have had a leak out of a package of 50. I defrosted them in the fridge and would find milk all over the fridge because of a tiny leak in the bottom of the bag. I now defrost them in a small bowl just in case- hate to waste any liquid gold! I also splurged for some Medela bags and am using those instead of finishing off the Lansinoh bags. Save your money and buy Medela!"
40399,0,"After reading the reviews, I've decided to give pampers a try and was slightly disappointed. It worked well as far as keeping the baby leak-free from #1. However, did not work as well as the huggies when it comes to leak-free from #2. My baby often take #2 with big force, so for that reason, it often leak out. The only brand that will minimize leaking out from the back is huggies."
63999,1,"I found this in a lightning deal recently and thought what the heck, I will give it a shot! Been using it for a week now and it has done wonders!! Our baby now knows when we put this on, it is getting time for bed. We wrap her up in this and then give her nightime bottle and once she is finished she passes right out in this and has been sleeping between 7-8 hours everynight now! I definitely recommend this!!"
146835,1,My grand-nephew loved these. My niece says he stuck most of them on his bed and some on the walls. They are bright and easy to apply.
183313,2,"This unit did not seem sturdy at all. I did not like the Velcro (SP) main support system or the thin legs that stabilizes this bassinet. I do have a 70 lb yellow lab and I was somewhat scared that he was going to knock it over (even on the lowest setting). For petless parents, this bassinet would probably work. But I returned it for a Graco."
4228,1,"I have purchased this gift over and over. The price on Amazon is the best and this is the type of gift that the family (and child) will keep forever, long after the cute little clothing gifts have been used and given away. Everyone is absolutely thrilled to receive this unique present!"
50770,1,"I bought this pillow for my girl, she loves it. It was a good buy, I'm happy with it ....."
2070,0,It did it's job. The only con I saw was that it sometimes left a white residue on my daughter.
169791,2,"this bed rail cannot be attached to a regular bed. it was not made clear when purchased that it is some type of rail that has to be nailed in or screwed in. nothing was included with it to show you how to do it plus there was not anything to let you attach it.! very misleading, i returned it"
82666,1,"We just got this today and have already fallen in love with it. I had been using a white noise app on my phone, effective yet not deal... But this Sleep Sheep is awesome! My baby girl loves it. She is 3 weeks old and I am soo glad we got this item. She is sleeping to the sound of the ocean right now. And its very soothing to me as well. :D I definitely recommend."
74016,2,"I was so excited to find this stroller when I was pregnant with my 2nd child, but it's been such a pain to use, I've been looking for a replacement now that I'm expecting my third. The stroller was nearly impossible to maneuver on sidewalks--to the point that my mother injured her wrist while taking the boys for short walks around the neighborhood during a visit. It's so difficult, I've really only used it a few times in nearly 3 years. It actually makes me grumpy when I try to use it. I've heard that the newer Joovy models have made many improvments, but I would not recommend this particular one. Terrible."
31315,1,"This is a space saver. I've had mie for about two years. I was happy with it since I took it out of the box. I used it for breast pump parts, bottles, nipples, caps, bottle straws, teether..and etc. It's worth the money."
15018,2,"I initially bought these bottles for their popularity and clean look. Also I was happy to know that these would be the best bottles when transitioning my baby from breast to bottle. I regret buying these, for the amount of money spent on these I am sure I could have bought something a million times better. They leak like crazy (especially the disposables). I have to use 2 paper towels over the bib because the bib gets so soaked. I am very disapointed in these bottles."
123851,2,I bought this for my librarian sister. It smells NOTHING like books. It's very overwhelming and smells more like the perfume your great grandmother bathes in prior to a big shindig. I am so very disappointed!
119849,1,"This is the best bassinet on the market, hands down. My daughter is so comfortable in it and sleeps, well, like a baby. It is sturdy and well-built. I love that it rocks if you rotate the casters. I'm especially looking forward to using the toy box once my daughter gets a bit older. It's nice to get multiple uses out of one piece of furniture. Whoever thought of this is a total genius! I would highly recommend this for anyone's nursery."
175489,1,The instructions could be a little better. One side needs to be mounted centered and the other to one side.But once you have it mounted it works great. After a few days you will have the hang of it.I expecially like that you can take it off the brackets entirely and how solid it is when it is locked.
164234,1,Very good service. You should subscribe it too!It's convenient and fast. I never need to carry a heavy diaper box myself any more. It's delivered to your house and cheaper than the market price!!
3886,1,These nipples worked just as I had expected. I have had to start adding a bit of cereal to my son's bottles and the size of the holes are big enough to allow the added food through without me having to expand them.
37032,1,"We purchased this seat after researching many consumer reports. We plan to use it as a booster seat when our son weighs 40 pounds.I read reviews before purchase of those complaining of twisted straps. This has NEVER been an issue for us.We DO NOT have this problem. Yes, the seat is a little bigger/taller than you would expect, but big deal. If fits very well in our Chevy Tahoe and Ford crewcab. We bought it before our vacation. A 10 hour drive. (I thought this would be a good test to see how well it worked for us) Our son ( 4 yrs. old)never complained about it and it was comfortable for him to sleep in. He loves to raise and lower his own armrests. Perhaps a 2 year old isn't quite ready for a seat of this nature. This was a excellent buy with no regrets. And believe me, I am picky about my children's car seats."
181750,1,A great classic baby gift. We got this for some friends of ours (paired with a pewter baby rattle) and they loved them both. Highly recommend it.
87527,0,"I bought this stroller a couple of months ago to have it around the house and for short walks. It's good for the price paid, so, don't expect Boogaboo quality. But my baby likes it, she falls asleep in it, therefore it's probably comfy. I think the iPod DOC is a nice feature. The wheels are on the cheap side, but being conscious of the price, again, is not bad at all. A good alternative to the umbrella strollers, because this is good for little babies."
153780,2,I have to agree with all of the other reviews. I also want to add that the batteries run out very quickly on this item as well.
56575,1,"After reading reviews I was concerned they wouldn't fit, that they would be cumbersome/difficult to use, and that they would call more attention to the stove. No, No, and at first but then No. WE do have an older stove in our rental so perhaps that helps with the fit. They easily open and close for access to the knobs. Can do it one handed. They get warm as someone had mentioned but not hot. I haven't cooked past 400 degree F yet though. Little One thought they were cool at first but because I wasn't saying no and taking his hands away as I had been, he lost interest reasonable quickly! Good product for our family!"
121172,0,"Our daughter likes this chair enough - but she gets bored in it easily. She's also quickly outgrowing it at just under 4 months. It can support 25lbs, she's well under the weight, but I think she's getting too long for it.It was given to us before the baby was born - if I had a choice in the matter I would've gotten one of the bouncy seats that also vibrates, we had one for a visit to her grandparents' house, and liked it much better."
183642,1,"LOVED having the cover for my boppy! My baby was a drippy nurser at first, and it was great to have a layer protecting the boppy. It's also easy to slip off and on for washing."
110931,1,I have twin girls (2.5) who have been using these brushes (now as supplement to regular toothbrush) since 6 months of age. Very useful to make sure their teeth are clean as the girls chew them like they are gum with a handle. Teeth look great so I like the brush.
26455,0,"I am not sure the style is worth the inconvenienceFirst, let me start by saying I love the look of this bassinet - this was the reason I registered for it. The color of the wood and fabric allows it to fit in perfectly with all of my other furniture, and the size is perfect for us. I also love the storage space underneath.My main disappointment with the bassinet is how difficult it is to clean the main fabric piece (the part which covers the whole bassinet). My daughter sleeps with her face pressed against the side of the bassinet. She has acid reflux and often spits up while she sleeps, leaving stains on the side of the cover. In order to clean that piece you have to take apart the bassinet, including having to remove the batteries to get to one of the screws. I've learned to keep the screwdrivers in the bedroom. I originally tried cleaning it with stain remover without taking it off, however the bottom of the cover is a very thin mesh type material that rips very easily.I do agree that even in the locked position the basinet moves. My daughter is always against one side and the bassinet is always tilted. And, the music is not that great. These two drawbacks were not concerns of mine but after reading other reviews I did have to agree with what the other mothers stated.As I started out saying, I love the look but I really am not sure this bassinet is worth it."
107524,1,My son seems to love this he is 6 mths old and he likes to stand on his own. When we place him in here he loves to have fun...
120363,1,I purchased the Unisar AngelCare Baby Movement Sensor Monitor while visiting my new granddaughter and my daughter loves it. With all the scares of SID this monitor gives her such peace of mind when the baby is sleeping on her tummy which is wonderful for a new mom. The ticking noise takes a little getting used to but other then that I can't rave enough about how wonderful this product is. I just wish I had one when I had my children!!
149922,0,"Have really used this product. My daughter used it when she was younger, around a year old. It folds in and doesn't really hold stuff up so she can get to it."
137299,1,"My husband surprised me with this pillow for Christmas and I'm so grateful to him! I am in the 6th month of my 3rd pregnancy. I had the Snoogle pillow during my last pregnancy and although I liked it, It still left something to be desired that I have found with the All-Nighter. It's longer and provides more support in more places, whereas, the Snoogle pillow was either really good for my mid-section and lower body or really good for my head, neck and shoulders - not both at the same time. The All-Nighter is large enough for all of that and I feel wrapped up in comfort every night. It's really difficult to get out of bed in the mornings but not because I'm tired - I'm just so comfortable! I have found that each night, it takes me a little while to get everything just like I want it and I may even have to adjust it in the middle of the night when I get up to use the restroom (which, of course, happens at least once these days). But after minor adjustments, I sleep more soundly than I ever did, even when I wasn't pregnant. And when I wake up, I'm not sore but feel completely supported and well-positioned.I've read some of the other reviews and have to mention that no product will work for everyone. It's trial and error and this has worked so well for me. I would hate for someone to buy this product just because I say that, though. Or not to buy it because someone who is shorter than me didn't like it. I am 5'6"" and it's perfect for me.There are a few drawbacks that were the same with the Snoogle pillow. The pillowcase is fine when it's brand new. But once you wash it, a zillion little snags appear and it is rough to the touch from that point on. This is something Leachco should work on for all their pillowcases. Also, it is a bit difficult to get back on after washing but as long as you put it on exactly how it was in the first place, it will fit.Someone mentioned that it doesn't fold up or store well because of its size. My experience with body pillows, especially those for pregnancy, are all like this, but I'm sure there are pillows out there that store better. I won't have a problem storing it in my closet afterwards but I understand if you don't have a lot of storage space, this would be a problem.Overall, I recommend this product highly and Amazon has a great price on it. I looked at other pillows that were more expensive. Nothing about them persuaded me that they were better - just because it's more expensive does not mean it would be better for me. Likewise, just because this one is only $50 on this website and cheaper than other pillows is not the sole reason it doesn't work for some people. Everyone's body and needs during pregnancy are different."
163877,0,"This mobile is outrageously priced for what it is. My fault for not reviewing the product description thoroughly, however, it is constructed of nearly paper thin plastic and has a huge red ball hanging from the end of it. It hangs with a thin fishing line, and it lacks any type of mounting device. Pretty disappointed."
110904,0,My 7 month old is teething and really loves to chew on this however I make sure I am always watching because he sucks on the whole brush part and I am afraid he could choke on it. It really should have a larger handle to make it safer. This is definitely not a toy.
66325,0,"My son is using this potty chair as an actual chair. He like to sit on it and watch his cartoons. He was always crying and running away when we try to use it as an actual potty chair.I think it OK, just too heavy. I think this product overpriced. And watch is too loud. It feels like we have a bomb in a house, so we took battery off right away. I am only glad, that this potty chair is convertible to simple chair, so I haven't pay my money for nothing."
43155,1,Excellent product!Really makes travel with baby easy & manageable!I wish I had discovered this with my older children!
5405,1,I used to find these at Target and Walmart but can't find them anymore. Great way to extend the life of our sippy cups!
47155,1,"We have a 3 1/2 year old daughter and a 5 month old son. We had been holding off on getting a double stroller since our daughter prefers to walk and we were not excited about lugging around and jamming a larger stroller in our vehicle. Lately however, she had been getting tired and slowing us down or asking us to carry her so we looked for a lighter weight but sturdy sit/stand.We have not been disappointed! Others have complained about the lack of space on the back if the front seat is reclined and this is true but we did not really find it to be an issue. She can still stand comfortably and if you slide the back seat out she can sit there OK as well. The stroller is very light and easy to fold up - barely any heavier than our Graco Metrolite single stroller. It fit fine lengthwise in the back of our Murano leaving the entire right side free for groceries, etc.The only negatives for us are the following:- There is a basket underneath but it is not very big and the rear seat (where our daughter usually sits) needs to slide out of the way to access it. We had been placing our diaper bag under our metrolite but we cannot do this with the Joovy- You need to pop off the hood and tray before folding it down and the connections are a little stiff- There is an accessory attachment with cupholders but there is not much room in this and cupholders are small- There is an attachment for the car seat (that needs to be belted in/atttached each use) but it is awkward and the rear seat cannot be used with this in place"
104527,2,"I have an extremely intelligent, high strung 2 year old who could just jump right over the standard height gates, so I looked a long time before I decided to get these gates. I read all the reviews and they were all good so, I ordered them. They are good quality but my two year old can just open the gate right up. He runs right through them. If we tighten up the pressure to keep them shut, He just goes right over and loosens the pressure so he can get the gate open. He's recently taught our one year old daughter how to open it. So, needless to say, I am very disappointed with this Dream Baby swing through gate."
163912,1,I like that it hydrates well enough for summer as well as block and does not feel heavy on. Need to blot a little right after application as you might look a little shiny. Do not like that it comes in a jar...prefer squeeze out or pump container for a more sanitary feel.
154611,0,"Bought this because I can't find the Tushies wipes that I have used for the past three years, which are amazing in my opinion.These seem ok, they are moist and soft but they have a weird smell that I can't stand, so I am going to try other brands."
118005,1,"I'm quite pleased with this warmer. We bought three of them: one for upstairs, one for downstairs, and one for the car. We've had them for 18 months now, and we're quite pleased with them. We only use them in the cold months, when the coldness of unwarmed wipes seems to make my son dread diaper changes. And I can tell a marked difference in his emotional state surrounding diaper changes when the wipes are warm.I love that the warmers are small and portable, and I certainly wouldn't buy a bigger one. However, I ended up donating the one I bought for the car. It only heats when the car is running, of course, but I hadn't thought of that when I bought it. The car wipes were never warm when I needed them, so it didn't make sense for us to keep a warmer in the car. It was easier to warm them up by holding them in my hands or blowing on them.The only negative that I have for the warmer is that it is a little difficult to open with one hand (which is sometimes necessary). However, I think the same design that makes it difficult to open with one hand is the design that keeps the wipes wet and warm. The wipes stay moist without drying out. And the warmer does a good job of keeping the wipes warm. None of the wipes will be hot, but they'll be much warmer than what you can accomplish with your hands. The wipes will get much hotter if you toss a towel or something over the warmer, which I discovered by accident. I'm not comfortable advocating that as a safe thing to do, and I'm sure the manufacturer wouldn't recommend that either. But I figured I'd pass on the information just the same."
130454,1,"My son really enjoys his swing! He is 4 months old now and we've had it since he was born. He loves to watch the fish moving and the lights flashing. It keeps him occupied. He used to sleep in the swing quite frequently. He doesn't now because he'll only sleep in his crib. Now I put him in it with the tray and give him an extra toy and he's happy for a good 15 minutes or longer. This swing is very sturdy and the bright colors are very appealing. It has several sound settings, including lullabies, ocean sounds and trickling water which is relaxing, and I think my baby feels the same way.When my son was very little, like under 11 pounds or so, I thought the swing motion was a little too strong, but this was better after he got bigger. I only use the swing motion part of the time anyway. Also, this swing is BIG. Make sure you have plenty of room. It's also extremely unportable, so keep that in mind."
87528,2,At first I really liked this stroller because it's so light but after a few months the wheel in the front broke so that it gets stuck every few minutes and has to be turned back around by hand so now it's not usable.
66545,1,"I've loved this stroller for the past 2 seasons with my 2 kids (24 months apart.) Now that the third one has arrived, I've fully realized the greatness of this stroller. The baby and the 2 year old sit side by side and when my 4 year old gets tired of walking he sits on the footguard and rides too! Sure it isn't the most comfortable spot in the world and I bet Schwinn wouldn't recommend it, but it sure gets the job done. My biggest boy thinks it is cool up there and we've been all over Boston with all 3 kids at once. This functionality is worth it's weight in gold!"
132873,1,"This product is wonderful! I've used it for my two kids and will use it for the third! It definitely cuts down on the odor. The bags are a little pricey, but they last a while."
150617,2,"Perhaps we just have a lemon but we have had soo many issues with this already. Unfortunately, I made a poor decision in purchasing this just before Christmas thinking it was a true sale price and then with the cold weather and busy Christmas season, the 30 day return period had expired before we took it out of the box and realized it was rubbish. (My bad -- I did not realize it was a 30 day return period. I buy so many baby items that I mistakenly believed that the 365 day return period applied to this).Anyway, when my husband assembled it, he found the hand brake did not work. After contacting the company, they sent a replacement for him to install. It was to take 5 - 10 business days, but arrived on the quicker end of the estimate. Since it was still very cold, the wait wasn't really a problem. When received, he installed the new brake assembly and with the brake actually working, we were able to use it. Given that spring has only just arrived, we have taken this jogger out less than a half dozen times thus far. What was immediately apparent was the fact that the stroller has a serious alignment problem and veers sharply to the left. Since my husband was not with me he didn't realize the severity of the problem, although I complained that my right shoulder aches from trying to correct the stroller and keep it in a straight line. We continued to tweek this problem until this week, when my husband was on a walk with us and realized the extent of the problem and called the company again and was told how to ""fix"" the alignment of the front tire. However, in order to do so, the actual wheel itself had to be canted at about a 45 degree angle on the frame, and couldn't possibly run efficiently, although it kind of sort of made it go straighter. Then, we took it out for about 6 frustrating miles and realized the tires, which we had just inflated, had started to go flat which made it a really long 6 miles with deflating tires and the need to veer LEFT. So when he called AGAIN yesterday, he was told the company was sending new inner tubes for him to replace in all of the tires, and a new front wheel, because it may be bent. If that doesn't fix it, then they need to look at the frame itself. These will arrive in 5 - 10 business days. In the meantime, I am trying to train for a 12k run in 6 weeks so these delays are very frustrating. While the customer service may be good, I don't actually want a ""reconditioned"" jogger stroller because we have to rebuild it ourselves from replacement parts. I would actually like Pacific Cycle or Amazon to take back this piece of rubbish without charging me for return shipping since there have been enough major problems for this to be considered ""defective"". If you have to replace the brakes, the front wheel, and the inner tubes because the tires go flat, and possibly address an alignment problem with the frame itself, there isn't much else to the jogger, other than the seat pad and the seatbelt is there?I am giving it a 2 and not a 1, because without all of these defects, there are features that appealed to me that redeem it and would make it a decent stroller, including the adjustable handle height and the fact that it does have a hand brake as well as the kick-bar brake at the back.Update 6/10/11:Pacific Cycle eventually replaced the jogger stroller with a new one, after going through a process of emailing photos so they could verify the ""forks"" that hold the front wheel on were in fact not straight (causing the alignment problem), then having us destroy the stroller and email photos and then they sent a replacement. I pleaded for them to do this ASAP since the 12k run was only 3 weeks away. The replacement arrived 2 weeks later, on the Friday. We put it together and took it out the next morning, only to discover, IT VEERED TO THE RIGHT!!!!! The replacement was also damaged, with the console being very badly scratched which is not good for being new out of the box. So I called again when Pacific Cycle opened the next week and played phone tag, only to be told, sorry for the problem but if you want another replacement, you will have to send the stroller back to us first to be inspected because this doesn't usually happen (2 strollers with alignment problems). I had already decided that I did not want the piece of rubbish any longer and had to contact Amazon customer service who kindly made a one time exception and allowed me to return the defective stroller. I purchased a different stroller (Baby Jogger FIT) which arrived on the Friday, 2 days before the 12k and thank God it was a dream. We love this stroller and it made the 12k very enjoyable (and actually possible). I will say Pacific Cycle has great customer service if you have to deal with them."
111467,1,"Opened the box. Waiting for the baby to ""pop out"" of his Ma-Ma, before we can put it to use."
126623,1,They are good diapers in all the brands which tried for little 14 months old kid. No rashes or no complains from my kid.Good product!!!
129924,1,"if you have a baby, and multiple cars, you must have a second base for the car seat. amazon provided this at a much lower cost than at the stores around my house."
184393,1,"I loved this item! It allowed us to co-sleep without worry and the little light was great for finding the lost pacifier or when we needed to see to get baby out. It was great to just be able to reach over and comfort our baby during the night in between feedings - we all slept so much better that way! It probably could be a little longer, but we swaddled our baby so he got to stay in it about 3 months or so (at the end he would be in it diagonally). Having an extra sheet would be nice, but if we needed to, a flannel receiving blanket tucked around the pad nicely without being loose."
110483,0,"After having heard rave reviews about this product, I ran out and bought the starter set. My husband and I tried to install a lock inside one of our cabinets, but unfortunately the magnets do not work through our cabinets. We have custom wood cabinets that have a white finish baked onto them. As instructed, we drilled almost all the way through our cabinet, leaving 1/8 remaining. The magnets only work if we turn the lock to a certain angle, which would not allow the latch to work properly. FYI to those with similar cabinetry."
52860,1,"I had my daughter back in July, 14 weeks early... She wasn't due til October! She was a 26 weeker weighing in at 1 pound 15oz. We brought her home weighing in at 4lbs 5oz and on a heart monitor and oxygen. We were concerned about getting her a regular bouncer because there was no support. I researched for a bouncer that would be best for preemies. The Baby Papasan came up the winner. My daughter fell in love with it. It supported her in everyway and for her being so small that was the selling point. It supported her head and her back with ease. We also had to make sure she would be comfortable with her heart monitor on. She loves the vibration ( she has colic ) and it does shut off after 15 minutes. That is the only thing that could be improved. She is now 10lbs and still loves the bouncer. I would definately recommend this for preemies!!!"
157544,1,"We actually had the ""froggie"" wubbanub but this pacifier saved us a trillion times. Our daughter was premature and had trouble with the pacifier falling out of her mouth. After many nights waking up to simply replace the pacifier I found this product. The stuffed animal held the pacifier in place but is small enough to not overwhelm. It also made weaning easier - because once we put it away - my daughter had gotten so use to holding the stuffed animal we were able to replace it with a small beanie baby as a comfort. I HIGHLY recommend this product!"
38657,1,"I use the Safer Bather every night in our Euro Tub and together they are a wonderful pair...the best thing about this product is that enables you to bathe your child hands-free and also provides the utmost comfort for your child. It makes bath time so much fun and not stressful!! A few comments stated that they had trouble with mold, etc. This should not be a problem if you properly maintian ANY of your children's items. We hang ours to dry EVERY night in the shower after giving it a quick sqeeze to get the water out. Then, every weekend I put it in the wash with the whites (hot water and a little bleach on the extra rinse cycle)and I have not had ANY trouble what-so-ever with mold, and we use it every night. My son is now 6 months old and after being washed EVERY week since he was born, it remains in wonderful condition...I even put it in the dryer (on low) to make sure it gets completely dry every now and then, and it has kept its shape wonderfully. I HIGHLY recommend this product and give Leacho, Inc. a thumbs up and ""thank you"" for creating such a great product."
87938,1,This toy is wonderful way to start a very young baby on her way to learning to entertain herself and to focus on an object. It also assists her motor skills when she kicks a hanging toy and is then encouraged by the rattle to repeat the action there by giving her exercise and developing motor skills. It also gives mom a break for a few minutes of rest!
160267,2,"I got this because people who use the ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" system advocated this product. Boy was I disappointed. Happiest Baby recommends a tight, very tight swaddle, and this thing is in no way tight. While it may stay closed, it doesn't simulate the womb in the way a swaddle should. I found the hospital blankets work best (yes, I stole some)."
104012,1,"The Avent Isis IQ Duo pump is incredible!! I have been using it for 3 months & I love it! I can pump twice the amount of milk in less time than with my old (PIS Original) pump. It is very comfortable...much more than the old pump. It is also very quiet. I love being able to set the speed & suction levels to my comfort. I was worried that this pump would be too difficult to master. But with a little practice, assembly is quick & easy. I'm so thankful that I found this pump!!"
123890,1,"daughter loves it. its very comfy, and very secure , not a problem so far."
96263,1,I've tried Baby Bjorn and other brand slings and had no luck. I was a little hesitant to order this one since my son is now 10 months but I'm so glad I did. He sits so comfortably in it and it doesn't hurt my back at all. The only regret I have is that I didn't get one sooner.
167804,1,"This is the third stroller I've purchased for my 21 month old daughter. Before this one we had the Inglesina Espresso. I was really satisified with that one until the cloth and basket ripped. After searching for a while I decided to get the Chicco C5. It was so easy to put together. I loved the fact that it included a cup holder and rain cover, which the seller didn't disclose. It is very comfortable to use and the 5-point harness works with my daughter. The handles are comfortable and at a good height (I'm 5'6""). The handle to carry once the stroller is closed is very handy. Especially considering I live in Japan and have to close the stroller frequently at the train stations. I thought the stroller was orange, but it is actually red. It looks very nice, though. Besides the basket, it has a handy pocket in the back. It steers great in tight spaces and doesn't take a lot of space in the trunk, which used to be a deal with my previous stroller."
98396,1,"Bought this to help our 1st son transition from an infant tub to the big tub and it worked perfectly. We used it again with our second son. We just pulled it out of storage to use for our 3rd son and it had finally grown mildew, after hundreds of baths! We're so pleased with this product that I'm ordering a replacement for our 3rd son to use in the tub. We have very big, strong babies (our 3rd was 10lbs at birth) so washing them in the bathtub is much easier than trying to fit them into an infant tub. We used this product for several months until the boys were stable enough in a sitting position to bathe without it. It isn't a rigid support, the sides are like a floppy bean bag. It doesn't hold up the child, it acts like a pillow to lay the child on when they're very small and protects their heads from the bathtub floor when they're learning to sit . It's also small enough that there's room in the bath for another child when this is being used. Highly recommend it."
175091,1,"I bought this tub when my daughter was 8 months old, after she didn't want to lay back in the infant tub and she has loved it ever since! She used to get excited about the quacking but not so much anymore. I keep it inflated, use it every other day and have taken it on travel and have not had problems with it leaking but I do add some air every month or so. She is 14 months now and still comfortably fits in the tub but we will probably graduate to a larger inflatable soon."

167159,1,This car seat is expensive but very comfy. I purchased another car seat that is less expensive and regreted it because it is not as comfy. This car seat is worth it considering that you can use it for many years.
91588,2,"This item looks very good and I was going to order it until I looked at the description which says it measures 1"" by 1"" inch. this is obviously an error and needs to be corrected if it is going to sell. I would order it if I need the accurate dimensions."
14983,1,"With our first child, we tried several different types of bottles, but were soon using Advent exclusively. I personally hate the feel of plastic, but very much like the solid feel of the Advent bottles. There is nothing flimsy or cheap about this product."
130385,1,If you want to spend money on something it is this swing! Baby just loves it and you will get every dime worth! They love the motion and the comfort of this swing! It is also a life savor when you need to get some stuff around the house done just move it into the room with you! Get it!!!
86271,1,"Works extremely well, very clear picture even in night mode. Sound quality is top notch. Overall great product"
141464,1,"The toy is simple to assemble. Sound is a bit loud. Sturdy and good for ""pulling up to stand"" toddlers who can't walk independently yet--easy to push around! The telephone is a big hit, but is a loose part (the only one) that can get lost. It was a big hit. You could get it for a much smaller child because the activity board will lay flat, so a sturdy sitter could use it."
37642,1,"These wipes are terrific. They are the only wipes I can use without my son breaking out in a rash (I've tried different brands). Amazon's price is horrible. As a new mom, I first bought them here, and I was shocked to see them in stores for 1/3rd of the price. I learned my lesson. I emailed Amazon to complain, but I never received a response. So, I'd recommmend the wipes, but buy them elsewhere (Target, Kmart, BabiesRUs, etc.)."
7993,0,"This product came as described- Stretch cotton terry. If you are looking for a thick, durable, would last through 100 washes changing pad cover, this is not the one. It's very thin, looks and feels more like polyester than cotton, and stains are hard to get out :/. It is soft and fits our contour pad well, it just wasn't quite what I was wanting out of a cotton terry cover."
108297,1,"We have twin girls that are almost 2 months. Wubbanums have been a life saver. When one or both starts screaming, they are instantly soothed by the pacifier and because of the extra weight the stay in as opposed to other pacifiers that fall out followed by even great cries.Of all the things we have gotten so far wubbanubs has been the best!"
134400,0,"I purchased this from for my daughter. It's a great product, great idea. Warm wipes for your child, for those late night changes or to use all the time. That's what we do, we use it all the time. The problem I had with it, was the LID. It wouldn't close. It would pop open. We tried everything taped it shut, putting things on it and finally gave up. But, on the bright side, we had the warmer for 2 years. Holds up to one package of papers wipes. You just have to fill it with water. The extra pads are expensive 2 for about 10 dollars. But, you can was the pads. If you forget the water, the pad and wipes turn brown. I WOULD GIVE THIS 5 STARS, IF THE LATCH WORKED. Wouldn't have to waste one of two wipes (being dried). I would try another company, and maybe the latch works better."
114965,1,"I attached a 2"" x 4"" with long wood screws on my hinge side because my wall was of disparate material and size. No problem. Don't try and use drywall (wallboard) to drill into as that might be the cause of several frustrations mentioned above-you're dealing with a hinge that may get frequent use. Even if I had used the third section, I believe it would have been fine because I built a solid hinge side. Out of the box, the templates were off, which I made sure I proved to my wife and baby (after drilling from the template), who were viewing from the nearby steps. I cut from the dotted lines but I noticed the bottoms didn't match up evenly from the cutout. That may have been a printing error. I just re-drilled and used wood putty for visible holes. One thing they didn't mention is that if you're using only 2 of the panels (a & b-guess I had a C in mine), you should realign your template B about a 1/2"" because it will be offset from your panel B (won't go straight across). Don't know if that would have impacted the operation or not. Other than that, it worked out nice and secure-solid as a rock. Achieved wife approval on this one. Just take some time and pre-read the directions for possible adjustments for your situation."
56655,2,This did not work even one time to keep our 2 1/2 year old out of our side-by-side fridge. It popped right off. I wish it had worked. We even waited the full 24 hours for the glue/tape to dry.

67010,1,This giraffe baby bank is classy and darling. Can be used for either girl or boy baby gift. I plan to get this one engraved with my grandchild's name.

133250,1,"I LOVE THIS PUMP!!!!!!!!! After 3 months, 3 electric pumps, and 2 hand pumps, it was brought to my attn that I had a hospital grade pump at my job the whole time. I was comparing pumps on Amazon, and I noticed every pump was being compared to the symphony. After googling the symphony and seeing the picture, I saw that it looked like the pump at my job.Well I ordered the parts on Sunday, and they get here on Tuesday. On my first break, which is 20 minutes, I go to the security desk to get access to the lactation room. I work overnight, so I have to go through security. Even though I told them ahead of time I was coming, They still were 10 minutes late. I only had 10 minutes to pump. Normally I only get about 3-4(1 1/2 on each side) ounces in about 18 minutes. I was able to go over the 4oz(2 on each side) in 7 minutes, and still had time to clear the condensation from the tubes.Plus I don't have to take the pump apart and clean it after each pump. I work overnight, so I just put the parts in the freezer until the next pumping session. I am so happy. I get to actually enjoy my breaks, and lunches at work. I may even rent one from the hospital. I'm sooooooo happy!!!!!!!!!!!111"
158470,1,"I have one of those babies who doesn't like to sleep....so at 12 months I smartened up and ordered a sleep sack, which helped with 80% of our sleep issues. He stayed warm all night, and mommy and baby were happy. He is now 20 months old and wears one every night. A couple of weeks ago, I was putting him down for a nap, walked out of the room, and turned to find him in the hallway! He has learned how to climb out of the crib! I panicked at the thought of this child getting out of the crib in the middle of the night - or worse - entering into a toddler bed this early. I looked into crib tents and found that they can be deadly. Sooo, as I put him in his Sleep Sack that night, I realized that there is NO way he can get out of his crib while he's in it. My friends are now using them for the same reason - the perfect toddler straight jacket! ;) Kudos to HALO for a safe product that keeps my little guy out of harm's way while I get some much needed rest!"

145614,1,"We got this rainforest jumparoo for our 5 month daughter because she was starting to use her legs more. We really like it and so does our daughter. It was easy to assemble and I love the bright colors and toys for my daughter to play with. The music and lights make it even better! It has 3 different height adjustments which is great as she grows taller we will get more use out of it. The seat looks comfortable and the back is padded, my daughter seems to be very comfortable it in. This is great product!"

26536,0,"We hunted all over for this bassinet when I was pregnant and this seemed like the nicest one - sturdy and pretty. We have used it for almost 4 months (our son is moving into his crib this weekend). This bassinet definately looks nice and is sturdy and was easy to assemble. But, I would have expected better ""bells and whistles"" for the price. The music it plays is annoying and too loud even on the lowest volume, although my son seemed to find it entertaining, but it only once ever put him to sleep. The locks that keep it from rocking are stiff and very loud, so if we have it locked, we can't unlock it to start rocking him when he fusses without startling him awake. But, if we leave it unlocked, it swings very easily and bangs the wall when we try to lay him in it if we don't set him exactly in the middle, then he gets rolled against one side of the bassinet with his face smooshed into the side. Also, it does not have an automatic rocking function, which I really needed at 3am when he fussed unless he was rocking, and my arm was very tired from rocking the bassinet endlessly. If I did it over again, I would get a bassinet that is sturdy and has a motorized rocking feature, and not put such a premium on aesthetic appearance. Also, if you do decide to get this, search around the internet to compare prices - I found mine with MUCH cheaper shipping from an independent baby store out-of-state."
137638,1,"My son was so excited to get his twilight turtle. He received it for doing well in swimming lessons and just loves it. My only complaint is the amber is really not able to be seen well so we don't use it, but other than that it is really a neat idea."
146522,1,"The baby absolutely loves it! It's easy to assemble and easy to take from one room to another for me, but more importantly, my kiddo absolutely loves it and has since day one. There is so much to do, so much to play with, and so much to explore on this jumperoo. She's had it for a month and a half now and has not gotten tired of it. The longest she has stayed entertained (and happily so, with not even momentary bouts of frustration) in it so far has been an hour and a half. That's a lot of time I can use for other things. I am so glad we have this toy!"

I called evenflo to report my problem and the operator tried being helpful but all i was asked to do was check my instructions to be sure all my parts were there and call if i had any more problems (after telling her it's been weeks. I believe it was a supervisor who basically tied the hands of the operator but i wam affraid to put my 5 month old in the saucer at theis point and with a 2 year old and babysitting a 2 and 4 year old it's a necessity i can't do without and after paying $100 for it i am upset.

She can now enjoy a beverage and snack without getting crumbs all over the floor and seat below her carseat. The Seat Saver does a wonderful job containing ALL spills and can be removed and cleaned very easily. It is made of a hard rubber material and does not move around once your child's carseat is securely fastened. It also has a lower flap that sits low enough so that your toddlers muddy shoes will not scuff up the front edges of your vehicle's seats. I recommend this for ALL car seats in your vehicles
107542,2,"Amazon would not allow me to change the order minutes after I had placed this order. I could not correct mymistake and had to buy it even though I did not want to. Sure, I could return it, bit it was going to cost me the postages plus the $5.05 that Amazon charged for shipping .Amazon has NO customer service. Any othercompany, I can just call to cancel. But not Amazon. They take your money and run."
145421,1,"My daughter has been trying to ""stand"" since she was a few weeks old...She has always been an active baby, so it has been quite frustrating to entertain her at times. We could barely get anything done, as we were afraid that she would get into something and we didn't want her cooped up in her pack and play or her crib all day. When she was four months old she was trying to climb out of her swing, and so we were lost! She hated her bouncy seat, and she didn't really like being underneath her rainforest gym, although it was cute, it didn't interest her for very long. She has been ""mobile"" since she was about three months old, she would roll from place to place to get where she wanted to go. So we purchased an exersaucer and that entertained her for a little while, and we thought that was a lifesaver, that is until we found this jumper. I had wanted to get one since before she was born, but it was mere cuteness. The first time I put my baby in this jumper it paid for itself...It was an investment, but one that I would make again and again. She loves it, and cries when we try to take her out...lol. She has fallen asleep in it sooo many times, but it is just too cute to listen to her squeal with delight and we laugh until we cry at her...There are numerous videos sent to relatives of princess emmy in her froggy jumper...She loves to jump and she has a couple of more months left to go in it...This is by far the best purchase of baby equipment that I have made so far...You won't be disappointed in the quality of this product or the value for your baby!"
179324,0,"My baby is breastfed but I sometimes substitute a bottle (with breastmilk) to help with the transition for when I go back to work in another couple of weeks. Currently we are using theComotomo Natural Feel Baby Bottleand I've had no problems with her feeding. After reading all the glowing reviews for this bottle and the manufacturers claim that it helps to reduce colic, gas etc because of the unique angle of the bottle I decided to give it a try.I must say also that I was given the opportunity to review the smaller sizes before my baby was born and gave them to a friend of mine who had recently had a baby and her baby loved them, mine on the other hand hated these. She would push the nipple out of her mouth and cry. After a few tries I gave up trying and switched back to her Comotomos and I've had no problems. It may be that she's already accustomed to the feel of her regular bottles since the nipples are larger makes her think she's still on the breast since they fit against her chin and nose just the way its done when breastfeeding.Just because my baby was picky and did not like them does not mean that your baby will as well. Reviews are generally made up of personal experiences so mine can be significantly different than yours."
39878,2,"The idea is there... BUT the sounds just sound so fake! I tried to sleep to this last night and i wanted to throw it out the window. I don't expect my infant to like it. Horrible noises. The volume goes pretty loud for a quiet infants room, but when you turn it up the horrible fake noises sound even worse! This is going back tomorrow. I guess i will continue my search!"
117608,0,"As other posters have noted, you can only shorten this jumper so much. My baby is 7 months old and is small (25 inches). We've shortened the jumper as much as it can go and even tied a knot in it, but it is still way too long. She loves it, but she can't do much jumping in it. Instead of ""the jump-up,"" we call it the ""stand around and look cute."" We're going to get another one that we can shorten enough that she can actually jump in it. I wouldn't get this version, because even if you have a smaller baby, your baby will quickly grow out of this one."
127116,0,"These are fine as far as function, but I tried them after using Pampers for the first four months and they are stinky! My baby smells like urine constantly in these, and it's not just when she's wet. I just really dislike how they smell. Will not be repurchasing."
2704,1,I was not sure if this product would really work. After using this product for a little over a week it is incredible. It does everything it says and I will be purchasing all the scents very soon!
26506,1,"I fell in love with this bassinet the first time I saw it in the store. I'm having a baby girl and it is a perfect alternativ when you feel like you need something away from the Pink!!! I am only giving it 4 stars because you have to order the sheets from the manufacturer. The bassinet itself is a 5 star product, easy to assemble and still pretty sturdy even if you are not &quot;bob the builder.&quot; To order the sheets call 1 800 544 1108 and be ready to have the model/serial number ready that you can find on the box. This was the hardest part for me since I had thrown out the box. Order your sheets EARLY, they are on backorder right now and I am due in 2 weeks!!! I live on the west coast and 2 sheets only cost me $ 12.50 Even if you have to order sheets over the phone, this product is well worth the money."
117488,2,"The title sorta says it all.Everything else about this seat I really really enjoy! But the slip/loop mechanism that allows you to adjust for the height of the door and your baby's size doesn't hold... Sorta a big deal. I've had to get two large, strong clips to hold pressure on the loop-within-a-loop way the manufacture tells you to make an adjustment to stop it from slipping. I have followed the instructions to a T and in my opinion a big flaw that this doesn't do its job so thus the (2) star rating.But other than that issue and the fact it can be rectified by ""rig'n"" its not horrible."
148059,1,"Our newborn is now 7 weeks old and has been using this seat, day and night, from the first week of his life - he loves it! The vibration relaxes him and he falls to sleep as soon as we put him in it. He doesn't love the toy bar yet, but it is removable which is nice. The chair is magic and made our lives so much easier!"
27105,1,The cradle did just what it said it would do. The only thing I don't find comfortable is wearing under jeans. It's more comfortable to wear under stretch pants or under a dress.
169405,2,"I was very excited to receive the Armoire this past weekend. However, after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces. I called Strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue. The only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part. The rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3-4 weeks. With the baby coming in within a week or so, who has the time to wait. The product is what you pay for."
1529,2,"I CHANGED FROM HUGGIES TO PAMPERS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE BUT NOW I SEE THAT HUGGIES IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE. MY SON USED PAMPERS WHEN HE WAS BORN JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE BRAND THE HOSPITAL WAS USING, BUT I QUICKLY CHANGES TO HUGGIES AND WAS VERY PLEASED. THEN I DECIDED TO GIVE PAMPERS BABY DRY A TRY SINCE THE PRICE WAS CHEAPER AND I GOT MORE DIAPERS FOR MY MONEY. THEY RAVE ABOUT A BABY DRY SYSTEM THAT LAST 12HOURS.....NOT AT ALL. MY BABY LEAKS AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS. THE DIAPERS ARE EXTREMELY THIN. I STILL HAVE SOME HUGGIES LEFT OVER AND I HAVE TO USE THOSE FOR NIGHTIME BECAUSE IF I USE THE PAMPERS MY BABY WAKES UP CRYING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NITE ALL WET THROUGH HIS ONESIE, PJ'S AND CRIB SHEET!!! HORRIBLE DIAPER...NOW I'M STUCK WITH OVER 200 DIAPERS. I'M GOING BACK TO HUGGIES AS SOON AS I FINISH THIS PACK, UNFORTUNATELY WILL HAVE TO BUY HUGGIES OVERNITES MEANWHILE I FINISH THE PAMPERS."
152968,2,"got this to keep the kids out of the medicine cabinet, little did I know it locks the cabinet for good. I had to break the darn thing to get it off."
180496,1,"I really, really like this bag. It is big, has lots of compartments and even has a place to hang my keys so they don't get burried in the bag. The materail is easy to wip clean. The strap is adjustable and comfortable to wear. I wish the compartment on the side for a bottle/cup was bigger, getting a sippy cup out os next to impossible but other than that I really do like it."
115395,0,"we really liked this seat- very cute- my kids liked it... they wanted to use it!! That was a good thing. However, it slides off the seat easy and doesnt always stay in place. It seemed very dangerous always sliding out from under them as they sat down. we eneded up not being able to use it."
124807,0,"I was very excited when I saw this Electric pump for just $45 but you get what you pay for. It has great sucktion but the speed is extremely slow and very little milk gets into the bottle. Not because it can't suck but because it is totally sealed. Think of a straw that can hold water when you have your finger over one end - that is like this pump. With pumping your breast and the bottle totally seals off the valve and no milk drips through which makes the 3 way bottle adapter fill with milk and back up into the pump. As soon as you release your breast from sucktion to milk drips down into the bottle but really - how often do you want to do that? It must be a design flaw and I'm hoping they fix it. The 3-way bottle adapter is great though - it fits with our gerber, medela and advent bottles - not with our playtex one though. If you are looking for a pump I'd advise not to get this one - get a nice hand pump or spend a little more and get the medela electric."
119781,0,"I found the BebePod to have a very strong chemical smell. I couldn't stand the smell and couldn't image having a new baby around it, so I returned it. It reminded me of a foam workout mat I once owned that had this strong chemical smell for all the years I owned it (and hardly ever used because of of it).I purchased the Bumbo seat and found it to have almost no smell. They sell a tray attachment for it now too, so except for the toy the BebePod Plus comes with it does the same job for less money."
160944,1,"We gave this as a gift to a really good friend of ours and he absolutely loved it! In fact, I loved it so much that I'll be getting one for myself when the time comes for me to become a dad. Awesome product."
153651,1,"We registered for this high chair because it matched the pack n' play, travel crib, and swing. I am so glad we have this chair! Our daughter is only 3 1/2 months, but loves to be at table with us during dinner. It has a 3 or 5 point harness, reclines back and has a neck support pillow for little ones!Another plus: we have a small kitchen and since it pulles right up to the table, it doesn't take up much space!Also, it is very easy to assemble! It only took my husband 20 minutes to put it together and he didn't have any problems. Another great Graco product!"
167057,0,"My husband and I have been searching for carseats as we are due in October of this year. We wound up visiting the local Babies R Us to see the infant carseats in person and get a better idea of which we'd prefer.First, all infant carseats have to fit the minimum safety standards in the US. So all carseats are safe by themselves. When a baby gets injured in a car accident, however, almost always it's because the baby wasn't in the carseat properly or the carseat wasn't installed properly. So ease of *proper* installation is what makes or breaks a carseat, in my view.The Graco carseat has good features for its price, but the base is very difficult to install. First, to actually attach it to the LATCH, you hook the one side's anchor up and then hook the other side up. But only one side is adjustable, so you have to either tightly hold the base with your hand or knee to make sure that as you're tightening it, it's pulling through and properly tightening both sides (since you're only pulling from one). Yeah, I have no desire to struggle with that while holding a baby.After making sure the base is tight, which is a pain in and of itself, you have to make sure the base is level. The base's ""level"" system is in the *carseat* not the base. So you have to put the carseat in, see if the carseat's level is in the proper position, and if it isn't, take the carseat back out and readjust the base. That's a pretty stupid design.Evenflo had the same issues, except that the level was in the actual base, so you don't have to go through all those extra steps of putting the carseat on, taking it off and readjusting it, every time you need to reinstall the base.After testing several of the models and speaking with the manager (who was wonderful in showing us each), we have decided to go with the Chicco carseat/travel system. Chicco, unlike Graco or Evenflo, has two anchors for the LATCH system and then you pull up on both simultaneously through a center adjuster. Much much easier. And the level is in the base, eliminating all those extra steps.Because the carseat and base will be moving between my car, my husband's vehicles, plus grandparents, we wanted to go with something that was extremely easy to install *properly* by everybody every time. We'll spend the extra money for that."
51226,1,"Great gift to the Wife....She loves it. I would recommend to everyone, men and women! I wish I would have bought one for myself, matter of fact im going to get another one soon!"
70906,1,just like everyone else.. we like this rocker...our 3 year old seats in and our 1 year old can have fun in it as well...looks like a good gift to give and looks like it will last a life time around kids...P.S&#62; Fisher-Price CS is great.. so 5 star for that.--------------------If you fine my reviews helpful please mark it as so.. Thank you.
98178,0,"I like the stick itself for the quality of the wood and the simple design, however the ball-and-socket assembly design did not work for us. It did not align correctly to line up flat on the wall nor for the 2 pieces (upper and lower stick) to line up just right vertically. I also didn't like the 3/4-inch or so gap between the upper and lower pieces of the stick. But since we didn't have a better option, I modified this one by cutting a piece of similar wood to fill the gap and epoxy it into one solid stick, and then attached it to the wall using a hinge-like bracket (L-bracket would work too) at the top and bottom so it would hold securely to the wall instead of moving around."
27856,1,"This stroller is a life saver. I can actually enjoy shopping now with my 3 and 1 year old without them trying to climb out of the shopping cart. They are both strapped in and can lay back and nap or sit up and enjoy the ride.I wish it had some sort of cup holder for myself but the ride is exceptionally smoothe for the riders and myself. The only downfall, it is a little heavy and awkward lifting it into the back of my van, but what can you expect for a double stroller. All in all I would highly recommend this stroller to anyone."
122960,0,"I purchased this set in Sept 2012. The rack is great for organizing pumped milk in the fridge, but it seems that they've changed the bottles: mine have white caps, not pink, and they don't screw onto my Ameda Purely Yours pump (many reviews here state that they do fit onto this and other pumps). This makes it a hassle to pump, because I have to transfer milk between bottles. I also find that the milkfat sticks to the insides of these bottles more than it does in my Ameda bottles -- not matter how hard I shake the bottle, there's still some stuff stuck on the insides. Annoying. I ended up buying these:Ameda 4 Pack Breast Milk Storage Bottles, 4 Ounce."
81527,2,"We have had a terrible time with our monitors. They pick up every bit of static! They also reset themselves every time we pick up or hang up the phone! They are NOT worth the price. After 6 months of suffering, I'm going to buy a new one tomorrow."
107422,2,"First let me say I LOVE having a video monitor - I'd swear that's why my kids are such good sleepers. I had the other Summer Infant Video Monitor (non-scanning) for a good 2 years before the receivor stopped working, so when I had my recent baby, I decided to try this model. It's only been out for 6 months apparently and they just haven't gotten it right quite yet. The picture quality is fantastic, but I am now on my third one and they are starting to break faster and faster. First of all, it is on a 2.4 Ghz frequency so if you have a wireless internet router in your house, this can't go near it. Also, be careful of wireless phones that may be on the same frequency.The first monitor just went black after 3 months - no picture on the screen, even though I had audio. Second monitor took an hour for the picture to show up once you turned it on. I'm now trying a different model - going back to a less powerful Ghz.The only upside is that the company sent me new ones very quickly - the customer service has been great and I think they want to get it right. I would stick to their other models though."
42721,0,I bought this for my daughter after reading the reviews so i thought i would buy it. After learning how to do it i put my daughter in it. She hated it! And she is a baby that likes to be swaddled and have a secure close feeling but she did not like this at all she just fussed the whole time she was in it. Needless to say it felt like a waste of money for me but each child is different who's to say yours might like it.
131892,1,Very easy to tare before weighing your pet. It is low in height so it does not take a lot of space. The numbers are easy to read and you can switch from metric to pounds.
103744,2,The items may not be new as listed. Please read the fine print. Don't waste your money.
22155,2,"Let me start by saying that in general, I love Medela products. The Pump in Style breast pump, the bottles, even the nursing stool are all great products. These bags, however, are infuriatingly shoddy.The zipper seal is barely a seal at all...sometimes it works, but oftentimes the seals just don't seal. Because I am aware of this, I do my best to keep the filled bags upright, but that isn't always possible. Also, because breastmilk isn't homoginized, I like to shake it up before filling baby's bottle. If you shake these crappy bags, your milk will fly all over. Then comes the joy of filling the bottle...these bags drip like crazy and a good portion of the milk (that didn't already leak out of the ""seal"")spills on the counter. Medela recommends using a breast shield to fill your bottles. What?? If I use a used breast shield, the milk is then unsanitary. If I use a clean breast shield, I then have to clean and sterlize it again. I don't know of any breastfeeding mom who has time to clean and sterlize MORE pump parts than necessary.I wouldn't recommend these bags to my worst enemy."
18203,1,"I work as a professional nanny. My current employers have this gym, and it is a godsend! The baby (10 weeks) loves the music, colors and flashing lights on the star which can be attached anywhere you want on the gym. He adored it laying on his back, now I can move it onto a side support and he's happy watching it for some tummy time and I get a much needed break from carrying him around. It is soft and well constructed, good size for a baby who isn't very mobile yet and hangs toys in good locations for him to bat at. The only things that could improve are that it doesn't come with many toys (though we have other toys attached to it now) and that the star only has 2 or so songs which are short and repetitive. It also doesn't have an on and stay on setting, it must be pressed or moved to make the music come back on and baby gets fussy if his star is quiet! Overall I'd highly recommend this gym for babies that are not yet crawling."
10492,0,"We bought this because we lived in an apt. and needed something that wasn't bulky. The price was right at the time as well. Now that I will be using it for a second child, I am reconsidering the purchase. My first daughter was always frigid in the tub because the spongy stuff on the back got wet and cold. It doesn't really have any of the bells and whistles of the other tubs and no hammock for smaller newborns. My daughter didn't use it long before we gave up and I just bathed her with me. Spend the extra money and deal with the bulk."
17977,0,My daughter loves this mobile. She loves to watch the buggies spin and listen to the lullaby. However after you turn the crank it only spins and sings for about 2 mins. After witch my daughter gets mad and starts to cry and I have to go in and crank it again. It's very pretty and matches our decor but it sure could play a bit longer.
175775,1,"The baskets are very cute and practical, however, they are a tad bit flimsy. Babies 'R Us sells some that are MUCH sturdier and I would recommend those over these. However, for $9.99, still a pretty good deal and a nice way to store baby's diapers, toys, etc."
184500,1,"My little one weighed 18 pounds by the time she was 4 months old so as you could imagine it was hard to lug around the infant carrier everywhere I went. She was too little to just put in a grocery cart so I figured I would give this a try. It was a god-send. She loves sitting like a &quot;big girl&quot; and getting to see everything around her. Shopping is a whole lot easier now. Even though it is recommended for babies 6 months and older, I would recommend this to mothers who's babies can't quite sit up themselves too since it wraps around their tummys so well it keeps them upright."
166745,1,"We really like this stroller. It is light-weight, folds really compactly. The carrying case is wonderful - we recently flew and took this stroller. The basket below the seat is worthless because a bar runs right through it - i can't even fit my small purse in there. The wheels seem to stick a little or it doesn't turn well sometimes - something is not ultra smooth, but that really is not a big problem. I also didn't feel real good about taking it on unpaved paths. However, it looks great and folds/unfolds very easily. Overall it is a great stroller to have and I would recommend it to anyone. I'm glad we opted for the City Savvy LX with the extended height handles. If there is ever a stroller invented that covers everything - lightweight, folds to be very compact, lots of storage, comes with a travel bag, not $[...] - I would love to have it, but it seems like you really have to have more than 1 stroller these days."
70035,2,All I got from this monitor was static. I returned it and bought the monitor from Sony. The Sony monitor has been crystal clear!
114291,1,"We love this compact booster seat. It is so easy to clean, and you can take it with you anywhere you want to go. Very good product, especially for the money!"
104911,1,I love all Dr. Bronners soaps especially this one. It's great for sensitive and oily skin. It doesn't over dry your skin since it's made with oils and it dissolves the dirt as well the oil. All Dr. Bronners soaps will leave you feeling refreshed and clean. I LOVE THEM! Definitely will recommend this product.
156271,1,"Our kids love these. They are made out of a soft cloth-like material and contain a mild soap. They make it easy for the kids to wash themselves during their bath. They also like to use them to do puppet shows, etc. Because they are designed for single use, they are great to take on vacation trips."
38415,1,"My infant really did not like bath time in two of the popular tubs I tried. A friend insisted that I get this product. She was so adamant that she ran out and bought me one that same day. Boy, was she right! My baby loves bath time now. The pillow allows him to be safely submerged in the water, which he seems to like. The soft pillow provides a comfy cushion while I fumble around trying to get his back and bottom clean. It is totally portable and easy to store. My husband and I really love this product, and you cannot beat the price!"
113087,1,Kathe Kruse toys are great. My daughter loves the doll. It has a great clutching ring and must taste good because she seems to love holding it and chewing on it. Toy still looks new although a bit slimy. I bought a pink one as a gift. Great shower gift.
178712,1,"I have tried several carriers, including the Moby wrap, and this one is by far the best. I think I like it most for the ease of putting it on or taking off. I can do it one-handed in less than a minute, which is great when you have a fussy baby on your hands. My daughter enjoys the Bjorn too, and squeals with excitement when she sees me grab it to put on. It is the most comfortable on my back as well, and I can wear her for a very long time (she's about 17lbs. now.) without feeling much strain on my back. I think a Bjorn is a must-have for every busy mom (or dad)!"
67722,1,WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THIS TABLE. I SEARCHED LONG AND HARD FOR A CHANGING TABLE. THIS EXACTLY SUITED WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT. IT CAME IN JUST A FEW DAYS AND WAS VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. IT IS VERY STURDY AND IT HAS ALREADY BEEN PUT TO GOOD USE WITH TWINS.
63321,0,"bought for my one year old and he didnt care for it. but i used it as a foot massager! one night i sat on the couch, put my feet down on it and the water makes waves and stays pretty cold. plus it doesnt get your feet wet. but it ripped at the seams after 4 months so bye bye foot soothing mat :(."
144060,2,"At first I loved loved loved this pillow. It was comfty, perfect support.. it was wonderful. In less than a month it lost its shape, the filling inside the pillow became seperated and now my boppy is floppy. It was soooo not worth the $50+ i spent on this. I am extremely disappointed. Do not waste your money on this one.. go get another brand!"
50160,1,"I LOVE this gate! My daughters are 2 1/2 years old and they are not ready to go upstairs alone yet, this gate gives me peace of mind when I'm in the kitchen doing dishes. Because my doorways are crooked and uneven, my daughters have been able to take down wooden baby gates and plastic baby gates in 2 seconds flat. These gates are sturdy and they are high, my girls know they're not getting over these things and don't try. It's so nice to not have to fix the plastic gate 50 million times a day any longer!There are a couple of con's but regardless I am very happy with my purchase. I installed it myself, the installation went pretty smoothly, I only had to re-do it once, it took me about an hour. I have learned over the years to carefully read and absorb directions and pictures before beginning because many times all you have to do is miss one detail and you have to do it all over again with anything you're putting together. That's not fun, so I wanted to avoid it. Okay, so my doorway was wide enough to need the second panel, but the panel did not extend enough to be able to install the foot support that comes with it. That's okay with me because it's sturdy as is. I would rather have the foot support, but it can't be helped.After reading other reviews and having my own common sense/knowledge of installing anything heavy to a wall, I knew I would need to find a stud. Now, I have a stud finder but mine had dead batteries, so I just knocked on the wall to look for hollow spots. Turns out I got lucky and my entire door jam was solid on both sides. I've also read reviews about the length of the screws. The only screws that I think should be longer are the ones that come with the latches.I used the screws that came with the gate but plan on buying longer ones and screwing those in. I thought there would be some sort of way to easily open the gate to walk through it but there's not. I'm 5'3 and have to struggle to climb over it, I just barely make it. You can unscrew the spindle on the latch to get in and out, takes a little bit of time but I've had to do it for two of my older sons.Shipping was pretty fast, I ordered it on October 3rd and received it on October 5th! That was exciting! Over all I'm extremely happy with this gate and want one more."
147222,1,"Like many reviewers have already stated, this would be a 5+ star product only if Graco had included a way to easily pack the bassinet option. I don't think the changer is as big of an issue for me as we stopped using that early on and you can change a baby anywhere. The bassinet is wonderful and works until the baby is about 15 lbs. Our little one is almost 4 months and still under 14 lbs. and we use this pack and play often enough to keep it packed in the trunk of our car. I am going to sorely miss it once she hits the weight limit. We have been creative and place the bassinet in a medium sized duffle bag along with pack and play sheets, swaddle, toys and any other gear we may need on the road. It would be fantastic if Graco provided a zip up bag for the bassinet/changer to accompany the pack and play. Overall very happy and hope to use it for many years (and children) to come!"
79320,1,"I too would have loved to have purchased this from BRU, but after several empty trips to the store and the product still being out of stock and supposedly on the way by..., my husband went online directly to the Kids Line website and ordered everything. We love the room though with all our hearts."
98895,1,"Being and Amazon Mom and using the subscribe and save progeam is thebest deal on pampers I have found by far. These have been great with our little one, I would say though that the 'up to 12 hrs' hasn't been the case for us."
45152,0,"Well, we bought this gym because it is very cute and full of bright colors, the toy animals are very adorable, it plays music and has fleshing lights! And we really gave in to the advertisement of ""3 stages for child development."" Now, the only three stages we were able to identify were ""1) not interested 2) interested for about a month 3) not interested again"" :). I know I am being a bit sarcastic but really... Plus, once you put the baby in the gym, the toys are dangling way too close to baby's face,which makes a little baby (1-3 months) a bit confused. Our baby didn't know where to look and got tired very quickly of all this ""STUFF"" hanging around her. Now that she is older,the gym is more interesting to her but she is much more interested in toys of this kind that have fewer toys, toys that are smaller. I can say with certainty that if I didn't have a gift certificate to pay for it, $60 is too much for something like this. Getting a cheaper alternative with fewer and smaller toys would have been a better choice."
97290,0,"Reading people's 1 star reviews, I agree with their findings. But on the PLUS side, this was the perfect size for our newborn once she outgrew her wash pod. At around 20lbs now, it's still the perfect size and shape for her in our bathtub...and most importantly, our baby likes being bathed like this.But the main downside is that this is a GIANT SPONGE. It's not like a bath pillow that has a cloth part with a plastic inside, this thing is filled with (polyester, I think) cottonballs. So it soaks up a LOT of water, and then you have to wring it out afterward to keep it from getting moldy. If you're gentle with the wringing, it doesn't have to fall apart right away... but it will eventually fall apart, and it will get moldy no matter how much you wring it out and leave it to dry - so you need to wash it in bleach every now and then...But if you just need something for your newborn until she's able to sit up reliably in a medium sized baby tub - then this *might* just last long enough. But there's a good chance no. So far we've gotten two months use out of it, and it only has one hole where the cotton is sticking out... I expected a little more from this company."
111909,1,"We first bought one of these gates when we moved into our house ... strictly to keep the pets from upstairs. It is wonderful!! Now that we are expecting, we're registering for another to go at the top of the stairs.The only down-fall ... Husbands (or whomever installs the gate) NEED TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! My dear hubby did not read the instructions (that's when I realized just how much like my father he really is) and installed it on the base board. Instead of taking it down and moving it a few inches, he left it as is and rigged some blocks of wood to secure the other side."
66277,1,"I have this seat in the Osh Kosh Naturals pattern and am very pleased with it. The seat is nicely cushioned, and I love how the straps can expand for taking the baby out of the seat. You don't need to readjust the straps everytime to comfortably take the baby in and out of the seat. My 3 1/2 month old was quite happy with the seat when we put her in it to go from our house to Staten Island for Christmas in a nice amount of traffic. She was perfectly content for the whole trip up and back. I love that this seat is latch compatible (you have to buy the kit for this). Using the evenflo LATCH retrofit kit the seat fits perfectly in my car and won't even budge a fraction of an inch.I only have a few grips with this seat. I don't like how the straps are adjusted. I've been spoiled by the Graco infant carrier I have. I'd rather have a pull strap to adjust both of the straps at the same time. Instead I have to settle for the adjustor knobs which I find to be hard to use especially in the rear facing positon. I have a love hate relationship with the memory harness straps that expand. You pay for this convenience with an extra layer of shoulder strap. You have to be careful not to stick your baby's arm in between the two straps for the shoulders or else you'll probably harm your child. I don't like how the harness height adjustments are done without rethreading the belt. You can never remove the belt from the seat completely for cleaning.Overall, I think this is a pretty good seat. I purchased this one in lieu of the Britax roundabout b/c I could secure this with the LATCH kit. It's a decent seat, but its no Britax. This one is just buying time until they update the roundabout."
824,2,"I have five your old and when he was a baby I swore by these diapers and hated all other brands. With my second child now two I used them for him as well and sometime about a year+ ago they must have changed how they made them because he started developing a bad rash. I thought maybe it was a yeast infection or the diapers and took him to the doctor. The doctor said they make diapers pretty good now and didn't think that would be it and decided on a yeast infection. After giving him cream for it, it still didn't go away. I changed to a different brand of diapers in within days the rash was completely GONE!!! But I hated the ghetto diapers and switched back to Pampers. And within a couple days the rash was back. I realized it was in fact the diapers and threw the rest of the box away and switched to HUGGIES! I've never been happier. I had my 3rd baby 2 months ago and it's all about the HUGGIES. Don't waste your money on these terrible diapers. Not only do the Pampers leave rashes but the diapers when wet let the ""liquid"" :) leak threw. They are awful! I can't tell you enough. Stick to a different brand, and return any Pampers diapers you got as gifts for baby showers so you don't have to deal with an unhappy baby!"
158705,1,"The cotton Halo is perfect for warm summer nights. I've washed it (cold water) and dried it (very hot air) dozens of times, no problems whatsoever :)"
73997,0,"I just dont love it. It does steer pretty smoothly and the handle is very comfortable. Here are my criticisms: No cup holder for parent or toddler; the seat for the toddler slides back and forth; the toddler cannot sit comfortably with the car seat in place; the carseat attachment and tray are very difficult to take in and out; the toddler is not really that secure when standing, he/she can just turn around at anytime or jump off; when using it without the infant car seat, it just doesnt recline enough if your infant wants to nap."
5337,1,"I decided I needed a bag so we could check our our stroller when flying. We have a Maclaren Quest. Maclaren sells their own bag for a bit more money, so I decided to try this. It worked perfectly. We have used it for both domestic and international travel and it has held up well so far. The Quest fits in it with room to spare, so we are even able to throw toys and shoes in there to reduce some of the weight in our other bags - baby items like strollers and playpens don't count against you as pieces of baggage; defintely helpful in these days of airlines charging for extra bags! ;-)We haven't taken it through security with us so I can't comment on how easy or not easy it is to maneuver (we generally have our car seat with us and just roll our son through the airport in that, so we don't need the stroller until we get to our destination)."
11070,1,"My 3 year old loves it. It blends in with our furniture well, and easily wipes clean. It is also convenient to move from chair to chair. It's only drawback is price."
50345,1,She loves itI no longer get my ears worn out with how horrible it is to be pregnant and trying to sleep (I used to get this when I was trying to sleep too....)She's happy - My ears are happy - I'm happyJust buy it for gods sake...:) ladies we love you all really
124965,0,This jump up was what we expected. The instructions were easy to follow and it has a very sturdy spring and clamp. Our only advice would be for smaller babies. Our 5 month old is short and her mouth hits the front (which is a metal bar under the fabric). Our solution was to place a rolled up blanket in front of her.
92348,1,Johnsons in my opinion is the best. This is a great little gift set. I love all the products in it and so did the mother to be.
123549,1,"Purchased item to use outdoors in summer months. Initially looked at standard pack n play. This is bigger(it is a square not rectangle)and gives toddlers more room to play. It sets up easily, has a carry handle on the cover and isn't too heavy. It wipes down easily and I like that the bottom pad removes for cleaning. The children who have used it (9 mos-1 year+) seem to like the bright colors and toys attached to the mesh sides. The mesh sides allow for nice breezes in the summer. Very pleased with this purchase."
83120,1,"Dr. Sears books have proven to be the perfect compassionate parenting text. And his reccomendation for the sling carrier has made my baby a very happy one. It took me awhile to get the hang of it (2 weeks), but it's been worth it. My baby loves it, everyone comments on how happy and good she is, I take her everywhere, even to my medical school classes. This brand has the strap in an awkward spot, and does not come in varying sizes. So if you're not of average weight and height (5'5&quot;-5'9&quot;), I would not get this. Motherwear and One Hot Mama (both have websites) both sell versions that come in different sizes. Petite, Regular, Tall, and Large."
29220,1,"The Safe Step has helped with breastfeeding, potty training, helping kids reach the bathroom faucets, cooking with The Child, and for grown-ups who need an extra 6"" boost too. Even the dog uses one of these to comfortably look out the window without putting his paws up on the sill. Read my full review in the April 2010 archives of Raising An Omnivorous Child on Wordpress."
117619,2,"Our doorway is 82 inches tall and at its shortest setting this jumper hangs to the floor. Our baby is just barely big enough for it and it's already too long. There is no way to adjust it any shorter, but it can be extended about 18 inches longer. Who has doorways this tall?"
84842,1,"WE PURCHASED THIS FOR OUR 2 LITTLE GUYS. THE YOUNGEST IS ALWAYS CURIOUS, I WAS AFRAID HE WOULD TRY TO CHEW HIS WAY OUT. IF HE GETS MAD FOR BEING IN TO LONG, HE LIKES TO CHEW THINGS. HE HAS NOT TRIED TO CHEW ON THIS AT ALL. GREAT PRODUCT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. IT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND NOT AN EYE SORE LIKE SOME OF THEM CAN BE"
36050,2,"I got these cups for my 15 mo old son. I thought that they would be great, a nice cup to take with us when we go out that I would not mind if we lost. I bought two packs and opened them right up, wash them, and then handed one to my son while he was sitting at the table. Not even two seconds later he had pulled the cap off and dumped the cup. This would be a great idea if the lids screwed on like the other sippy cups. The lids are really easy to take off. I would not recommend this cup to anyone unless you want a cup that your kids can open and you want to sit right next to them when ever they use this cup. Me I would just rather give him a regular cup he can not make any more of a mess. I love the other take and toss items and am really disappointed in this one."
47585,0,"I bought this before our baby was born just because we could fit it with our bed. Luckily for our little queen bed its level was just at the right height for Mom to easily get to the child. For a normal King size bed with box spring this bassinet is wayyyy down.Also it is a pain to ""disassemble"". There are two joints in every horizontal ""pipe"". Although there are buttons that are supposed to make them loose. But typically one joint would get loose but other won't. I was relocating and I decided to took this bassinet with me for the baby during our stay in the hotel. It was a real struggle to get it to ""disassemble"".You can get cheaper ""pack n play"" that would be a lot more convenient than this."
96800,1,"I think this is a great sound machine. It has a timer on it, which we use every night. I particularly like the rain and wave sounds, which relax my son. We've had it hanging on my son's crib since he was born. He's now 16 months and still uses it. We just bought another one for our son who will be born in February. I like this one better than the giraffe version - of which we have the travel size. The sounds are much more soothing than the giraffe. The giraffe has more &#34;play&#34; sounds than &#34;sleep&#34; sounds."
165470,1,"This box has 246 diapers in it, and it's a VERY large box. It has 3 of the packs of diapers in it, and each pack as the Gifts for Grow points for moms that do that. I love Pampers, I've never had a leak or a spill over. :PFor the price, you can't beat this box!!"
28797,1,It has a smooth rocking motion and the rocking ottoman is nice too. The assembly instructions could have been a little better but I got it together no problem. We rock our baby to sleep in it every night and in the middle of the night when she wakes up for feeding. Its comfortable and relaxing.
59777,1,It is a great bath tub for my newborn! The side for the newborns in this tub makes them feel safe since the baby does not slips so easily. It also gives a good support for the head. You can actually enjoy to give a bath to your baby by focusing more in cleaning and playing with the baby than worring about finding a way to hold him to avoid him to drown. It really facilitates the bath for first time parents.
153517,0,"I have wanted one of these diaper bags since my first daughter was born, but never wanted to shell out the cash. I finally gave in when I wash shopping for the arrival on my second daughter.We have been using this bag for 2 months now, and while it is extremely cute and fashionable, there are a few things I would change.1. While the shiny plastic works well for the outside of the bag to be able to clean it easily, it does nothing for a struggling mom with her hands full. This diaper bag is always sticking to doors when I am struggling my way out of doctors offices, etc. It's just annoying.2. The bottle holder cooler only holds a bottle, not an ice pack or anything else, but I have another bottle holder cooler that holds a bottle ice pack, and paci.3. The changing pad should have velcro or snaps to keep it folded. The tie straps are such a pain when you have so many other things to accomplish on a bathroom trip with an infant and a toddler on a long shopping trip day or any other long getaway day.There are plenty of pockets on the inside, but it would be nice to have a few on the outside for convience items.If I had to buy another diaper bag, I would buy a better designed one who kept busy mommies in mind."
25687,1,"Our 6-month old son has torticollis on his right side and his physical therapist recommended this to help him keep his head straight while sleeping in his car seat, high chair, or swing...it works very well and is comfortable for him!"
176029,1,This stroller folds down nicely to fit in our Corolla trunk. The back reclines down enough to do diaper changes (so you don't have to use a dirty restroom). My friend had the Quest which doesn't recline all the way to do that. The sun shade is the best. It was perfect for my son at the beach since the back folds down I was able to put him in there at 12 lbs.Okay so the basket is small - travel light. It's not quite like an umbrella stroller. We might what to purchase a Volo later on. Buy last years model for cheap online
167634,1,"This is my second one: I'm purchasing another simply because the first works great but I need a spare for laundry.Pros:-pretty easy once you get the hang of the arm flaps-really tough for a wriggler to get out of compared to other wraps (I've tried snuggle me, halo, etc.)-one size fits all - most other brands only fit a certain size baby so you end up buying multiple sizes as they get bigger. My little guy is three months now and still plenty of room to grow.-three months of washing the first one and still looks pretty new-soft, comfy fabricCons:-a little pricey compared to other brands, but has worked for me from newborn-3 months and I anticipate a few more months of useBottom line: Worth it. Buy two if you can. You really need to pay attention to the instructions, though. Give a little wiggle-room in the arm flaps, but wrap the last part on TIGHT (that's probably why the poor reviews had a tough time)"
13944,2,These bottles leak and are a waist of time and money! I read instructions throughly and bottles still leaked after a week of use so I decided to purchase the original Platex bottles and I am now satisfied. Sometimes new isn't always better.
179929,1,"This is by far the best swaddling blanket-period. I have 4 of them and used them for two kids. My first was a real Houdini and could get out of EVERYTHING else- except for this. The material and stitching are excellent and have survived countless washings in boiling water. It really takes the fudge factor out of the swaddling and you can even get it on correctly in the middle of the night when you are have asleep. The only other one that seems this good is the Woombie but you have to buy multiple sizes of that one and as each is around $30, it's way more cost effective to get the Miracle Blanket- which you can use from newborn until pretty much when your baby doesn't need to be swaddled anymore."
167623,1,"This is the best swaddle blanket out there. We tried Kiddopotamus and it only worked until our son was about 2 months old. If I had to do it again I would've bought this right away. We purchased the Miracle Blanket when our son was 2 1/2 months old. I was a little nervous not knowing how long we'd be swaddling him. However, he is now 4 mos old and still swaddled at night and during most naps. He has been sleeping 7-9 hours, in a row, at night since we started using this blanket. I do think it makes a huge difference in their sleep when they can't startle themselves awake. This is our fifth child and I wish I would've started using this blanket much sooner :)"
1182,1,"When the ad said 12 hours of overnight leak protection, I am sure they are exaggerating. But for a baby's whole night's sleep, it has a three-layer leak protection and it doesn't wake up my baby in the middle of the night. Good thing, too, because it keeps the baby's skin dry."
122163,0,"This product seemed okay at first, but it is clearly made quite cheaply. The actual ""pillow"" is an air-filled plastic that is made in China. The pillow is sent with a hand pump that you need to use to inflate it. There is not enough pillow to let baby's entire body rest around your side for the football hold, and the back support is minimal. After using this product for one month, the pillow began to leak and deflate requiring us to get a new breastfeeding pillow. I have used the ""My Brest Friend"" previously and I am getting this item as a replacement. I wish that I had gotten it initially."
122128,1,I love this backpack- it is stylish and inexpensive but as useful as the $80 bjorn. My husband will even wear it! It has the 4 positions and unlocks easily on the side so you don't pull baby up and get him/her legs stuck.I couldn't be happier with it.
61918,1,"The best diaper ever. My son tried other brand and got diaper rash, but with pampers he is ok. Then since 1 year I put this pull ups diaper because he is too fussy and active while I am changing him. This is so easy and no rash."
154885,1,"Yes, this blanket is more expensive then most any other kind you will find. HOWEVER, there is no other like the Miracle Blanket. This is THE ONLY BLANKET FOR A LARGER 3 MONTH+ BABY. My baby girl is now 6 1/2 months old and can still use this blanket. I just omit putting her legs in the pouch now, but the same concept with swaddling her arms down is still the same. Most babies don't need, or don't want to be swaddled anymore after a few weeks for months, but my 6 1/2 month old 17lb baby still requires to be swaddled to sleep at night otherwise she still attacks her face with her hands and upsets herself. Without this blanket we would not have a baby who sleeps 9-10 hours at night. I would recommend this for any age under 8 months or so (since my baby is only 6 1/2) and for any babies who still pick at or grab at their faces when tired and won't go to sleep because of it. My doctor said if an older baby still wants to be swaddled to go to sleep then it's still okay to do so, just as long as you're not restricting their legs anymore beyond the age of 3 months. (Hence, why I don't put her legs in the pouch and just leave them hang out.) As a wroking mom, I'd never get any sleep at night if my baby wasn't swaddled and at a older age any other blanket just doesn't work, because the older the baby gets, the stronger she is and can break out of the cheaper blanket wraps."
51323,1,"While this is a simple product, it worked well, folded easy, and was easy to use. You can pretty much unfold it with one hand. I used this in public bathrooms and on beds and it did the job. The surface is easy to clean and wipe down. It went everywhere with us in our travel pack. I've see ones with pockets, but leave that for your bag."
77470,0,"Things which I like about this swing:- Cute design, color, fabric material, power plug-in feature, lighting optionThings which I don't like:- Weak motor (it seems OK now for my little girl, but will NOT be the same when she's older and heavier), the seat doesn't recline enough for the baby to actually sit up (she can hardly reach the toy bar), the butterflies are hung quite high and she can barely see them."
76120,1,These trays are good to freeze baby food. The lids doesnt really snug tight but atleast it covers the food while in freezer. Once frozen i run hot water at the bottom and keep it outside for 3-5 mins. The cubes come out fine whether solid or liquid food items. I transfer them to ziplock bags for further use.
151344,1,I love this mirror. It is very clear. It takes some adjusting at first and it will move a little over time. But I love it!
51003,0,"Im a stomach sleeper, so getting comfortable while pregnant is almost impossible. I got this pillow to see if I could train myself to sleep on my sides. Unfortunately, after about a month, I have tossed it out of the bed and went back to using several pillows. It is great to prop up on and sit elevated if you have heart burn. It is a VERY big pillow, and like most pregnant women, I have to get up numerous times a night and the pillow was always in the way. I am expecting twins and think it will serve as a great feeding pillow. Dont completely hate the pillow but it didnt help me sleep any better either!!!"
20194,1,"First off, this particular bottle set came with fast flow nipples. Slow flow nipples can be bought as an add-on item here, and I couldn't find slow flow nipples at any of my local stores. As far as I can see, there aren't medium flow nipples for this bottle. My baby had mild colic (unable to BF, so he's a formula baby) and after trying Avent, Evenflo and MAM, found that these bottom-venting bottles worked the best for reducing air bubbles in my baby. This is my third baby."
119964,1,"I got this and I LOVE it. We starting using it around 4 months. Baby loves it too. We take it with us when going to restaurants. It is so much better than leaving him in his car seat. We feed him his baby food in it too on our kitchen counter. If I had to do over again... I'd get one with a tray. It is not plastic, it is a firm foam rubber. It doesn't push into my son's tummy at all and I'm really glad I got it when I did."
114971,2,This is the worst gate out there! I called customer service three times and relayed my difficulty. NOTHING should be this hard. Both of the gates I purchased were malformed. UGH!
151726,1,"Purchased for my pregnant daughter. Don't know if it prevents stretch marks yet, but will re-admit statement after the baby is born. I was told that it feels great........and smells good too!"
51015,1,"I am a belly sleeper and I never sleep on my side. When I could no longer do that and had to start sleeping on mhy side, I had pain in my hips and my shoulders and I kept tossing and turning all night. My back was hurting. I would surround myself with pillows but nothing really worked. This pillow is the greatest - I do not care if it does not have the softest cover or that it takes up a lot of room (it is still less than 5 pillows I was using before). My hips/shoulders do not hurt anymore and I can actually sleep thru the night. I think I would like to keep it after I deliver as well. :-) I really do think it is a life saver."
101490,1,"Our 10 year old boy still struggles with bed wetting a couple of times a week. We got this 12 pack to take with us on vacation this summer since he will be sharing a bed with his brother in our vacation cabin. He's a stocky boy, weighs about 100 pounds and these fit him well. Not too tight not too loose. They seem to have a lot of stretching ability to them, so I could see them working for larger children or even smaller adults too.We tried the boxer version of these last year, and they worked fine, but the outer material on the boxer version is kind of ""crackly"" and makes noise when he moved around. If your child is a little embarrassed about wearing something like this, go for these briefs. They are much quieter and the child can easily forget that he's wearing them and not worry about other people noticing the crackling noise.While they don't necessarily look like diapers, they definitely don't look like underwear either, so don't plan on being able to fool a kid into thinking these are just a different kind of underwear. The material does have a print on it to help them look less like a diaper. Some are camouflage, and some have pictures of skateboards or bikes and various other boy related stuff. The sides do tear off easily for taking them off in the morning, and we haven't experiences any leaks. I think these could really hold a LOT of liquid.This price was quit a bit cheaper than buying them at the local store, and most of the other listings on amazon were for much larger quantities, but we only needed about a dozen of them to take on vacation with us so this packaged works out just fine."
109415,0,After 2 or 3 uses i usually toss out and replace because doesn't seem very sanitary. Other brands have the mesh as replaceable so seems like a better idea.
21265,1,"This is the greatest product. I love this body wash! I was startled when I found my daughter's old body wash on the Skin Deep website with a 5 hazard score. After doing some research I came across California Baby (which only has a 1 hazard score). Not only is it safe for my daughter, but it has a great smell and works really well. It is safe enough for my newborn as well. Although it is expensive, it is definitely worth it."
6132,1,I just love this carseat for my baby girl. It is easy to use and my little one doesn't fight me when she is in it like her other carseat. It is also not bulky so it fits in any car.
38995,1,"This is a great product. We use it almost daily on our walks and runs. It is great in the summer to keep the sun and bugs off of your baby and great in the winter to keep your little one a little sheltered from the cold wind. I guess my only negative about this product is when the shade is down, the baby can't really see out, but my little one doesn't seem to mind. I just put it down when she needs to be out of the sun, wind, etc and then lift it back up. You can affix this product in a couple of ways to your stroller, which is nice. We have an InStep Jogging Stroller and have not had an issue with the shade fitting on the stroller. We have been very happy with this product thus far."
176655,0,"I bought these bottles for its convenience but soon realised the wholes on the nipples are too small for the age recommended and on top of it, the vacuum created inside the liners make it so difficult for the baby to suck the formula out of it. My son was on these bottles since he was 3 months old and it took forever to finish a 4 ounce bottle.I increased the opening of the nipples and it got better, but once I changed to AVENT bottles...my baby was able to drink much more and more easily and put on 3 lbs in 2 weeks!I totaly recommend these bottles for trips or going out but Avent bottes are the best there is."
45068,1,"This will be our second gym play mat, her first playmat was a fisher & price one from wal-mart, the grandparents bought it for her, and she just didn't really show any interest in it, it was not brightly colored nor there was really any interesting toys on it for her to stare at, and the mirror was so small that she just didn't care much for it.Even though I didn't want to spend to much money, I asked around on some of the parenting chat forums I go to and also asked other mothers from playgroups and they all mentioned this gym playmat and said that they found this a good investment, and I thought what the hell, she will either like it or not and if she doesn't then I can always take it back and see if I can exchange it for something else.We both love this gymini, my little one stares and looks around and coo's and gaa's at the toys and stares at herself in the mirror lol, it is so cute. She has started grabbing on to the toys and kicking them, which I suppose is not bad for a 7wk old. So it turned out to be a not bad investment, eventualy she will grow out of it and I will have to buy another expansive toy, but if it helps with her development it is worth every penny."
102023,2,"this works okay about half the time, for me anyway. I use disposable bottles which this is supposed to be compatable with. It seems that the bottles are usually not warm enough or hot enough to really scald someone. I don't recommend this. I usually just warm water in a cup and warm the bottles that way. I feel bad that someone spent money on this for us."
38580,1,I first used this in my infant tub to bathe her. It held her nice and secure and kept her warm. Next I used it in my big bathtub until she was about 6 months old and then I went to the ring. In the tub it was wonderful b/c it held her out of the water and yet it was easy to rinse her off and I felt that she was safe and secure. A must.
88389,0,"We ordered this dresser for our baby's nursery. Luckily, he isn't due for a few months. One of the drawer pieces is defective and we'll need to request a replacement from the company. We went through this with the crib too (same company). The good news is that the company is very responsive and ships the replacement piece pretty quickly (and at no additional cost). Plan on 10 - 14 days. We are very pleased with the furniture and the savings. But, we're glad that we have plenty of time given the issues with broken or defective parts!"
35681,2,As a car seat technician this product and others like it make me cringe! To use one of these is to risk your child's life in a collision. Nothing should ever go below your child in a car seat and nothing should ever touch the harness but the child. Use blankets OVER your child not under them.
125285,1,"My baby loves to play with this. She isn't as fond of chewing it, as she is of holding it (since it's just the right size) and playing. I would buy this again."
19685,1,We got this because of all the reviews we read. We really like it and are very pleased with the results. Only issue is sometimes the milk comes out a little warmer then we prefer but by trial and error we have figured out what level to put the water at to get a bottle at the tempature we like.
21168,2,just bought it today - love the decor but the clamp is about 1/2 inch too small for our Simplicity Ellis convertable crib - so disappointing & frustating -we're off to BRUs to return it & find another one - ugh.....needs to be re-designed to make it more adjustable.
119753,1,"my gosh! i have to admit that i was a little nervous after reading the one bad review about this item, however, i am extremely pleased with my decision to order! its perfect - the pink is perfect - the bear is perfect - the little flowers and butterflies are perfect! - the pink is more of a dusty rose and its a beautiful addition to our daughter's natural colered crib! great quality, soft and fluffy, i just fell in love when i opened the box...its so girly and wonderful..."
157982,1,"some people are confused about how this thing works so briefly: you put this one and 1/2 foot by one foot rectangular flat thing under the baby's mattress and the sensor will ""tick"" with every breath or movement the baby makes. that way you know he/she is breathing. OR you can turn the ticking off and the alarm will sound if the baby doesnt move (or breathe) for 20 seconds or more. it will also transmit sounds like any monitor.so- the worst part about this monitor is the price, i'll grant you. but really how much is your peace of mind (and a few hours sleep) worth to you? if you look at the almost 100 dollar price compared to the cheapie 30 dollar monitors, i'm sure it will give you pause as it did me. but after using this monitor for 2 babies, i gladly would have paid four times the price for the chance to be able to sleep knowing this machine would let me know if my baby was in trouble. yes, it will go off if your baby scoots off of it but when that happens we would say great! at least we know its working! so just stop using the motion detector feature when your baby is old enuf to scoot, or when the risk of sids is extremely low-about a yr i think. EVERY time someone asks what is the one thing they need when the baby's coming i ALWAYS recc this. i could work for the company, that's how good it is.if you are paranoid or cautious or just plain nervous about having a newborn, GET THIS or you will never get to sleep!! how many times have you heard of a new mother getting up every two minutes to check on her baby to see if she is breathing? i'm so paranoid i'd even worry WITH this thing, worried that the power would go out! (but i believe there's a battery backup so i went to sleep finally!)GET IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!! i will come to your house and set it up for you myself its that good!!"
177628,1,"I bought this pump because I didn't want to spend [the money] on the Medula if I didn't have to. I have not been sorry. I'm able to express 5 to 6 ounces in less than 10 minutes. My son is 6 months old and I've never had any problems. The pump never hurts, it's easy and convenient and after you use it a few times putting it together is no problem. I work part-time and the Avent Isis has been great! I don't have to worry about proximity to an electrical outlet and it is very quiet. I also love all of Avent's bottles and sippy cups all of which can be used in conjuction with the Isis pump. I would highly recommend this pump to anyone."
82085,1,Really pretty and great for little ones who fall out of the bed. The sides act as rails.
110451,1,"I agree with other reviewers -- these locks are fantastic when installed, but you might pull your hair out during the installation! A few pointers:- Use an 18V+ cordless drill, these screws are extremely difficult to install into hardwood with a handheld driver- Use the drill stop, or better yet, borrow or buy a more robust stop. This is especially important when going into laminate, you can easily bulge the door if not careful. I found that I could back off a little bit on the hole depth and still have the magnet work. Try this first.- Be careful if your doors have varying thicknesses, the screws can find their way through the door as well- Pilot holes are a mustThis is an excellent product, but considerably less time was spent on the instruction design. If you don't understand them, stop and find someone who does, because you will damage your cabinet and you will regret it!"
50274,1,"I bought these strap covers:1. because my daughter's neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her Snugride, and2. because I could get them in PINK and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time!This product solved both problems. When I took them out of the packaging and realized how BIG they were I was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft. Luckily, she adapted easily to them and I think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat."
178260,1,"I initially used 4 oz bottles to store my breast milk in the freezer but after about 20 or so bottles, I realized I did not have enough space! This storage bag makes it easy to stock on milk without having to sacrifice freezer space. I was also able to find a freezer-safe plastic container which I use to stack the bags thereby eliminating the risk of accidentally tearing the plastic bag (which by the way is very thick). Now, I don't have to worry about not having enough supply despite going back to work!"
135187,2,"This item doesn't stay warm for more than 20 minutes! I bought it because of the good reviews, but then ended up going out and buying an electric wipes warmer."
10858,1,I love these pads! After reviewing many reviewers I decide to buy one and try it. It is so soft and absorbent! Mine has not pilled and has gone through many washings. I ended using it in my diaper bag since the changing places in public restrooms don't always appear clean. It fits so much better in my diaper bag than a bulky changing pad and my daughter likes better since not cold. I bought more of these and left one in her cosleeper for leaks and as a changing pad at night so no trips to nursery. Another was placed downstairs with wipes and diapers in a basket for quick changes on the couch and everyone loved using them.Great price and you will get your moneys worth out of them. They go anywhere and we left one at grandmas and one in the car for changing on the seat when not convenient to change elsewhere. Will use for next bundle of joy!
76299,0,"I thought this was such a great product and still have some hope for it...We tried it in the craddle from the day our boy came home from the hospital (now 4 weeks old) ... but had to discontinue using it as he kept sliding down the foam pad. I love the wedges on the sides, you can sort of prop him up but we learned that rolling a blanket and laying him propped on that (like they did in the hospital) works better. This way he is on his back but propped slightly on his side to prevent choking or spitting up on himself. I don't think this product will ever work for us, but I will try it again once our guy reaches the crib."
179173,1,"I gave these to my co-worker who has a two week old baby to try out. Although I don't have much to report yet, I will update this review with his input. Positives about this product is that each bottle has a differently colored lid, BPA free, claims to reduce gas/spit-up/colic/ear infections, and dishwasher safe. I'm specifically interested in how easy these are to clean, if they are prone to leaking, and do they indeed reduce gas.I believe the price on these is reasonable if the product does as it claims. Product packaging has information in both English and French. Other variants of this product exist such as one with a wider nipple and smaller bottles."
86073,2,We have owned this monitor for 19 months. It worked great until it just stopped showing video one day. For the price of this monitor you would think it would last past two years. Now with our second child just born I am buying my second monitor. Buyer beware!!!
38051,0,"This is a fine product for the price. The quilt is really cute and all accessories are holding up very well. However, the bumper doesn't tie at each corner, it does fall short at almost every side. The crib skirt is pretty flimzy and difficult to put on. But it's a pretty set and I think worth the low cost. Also, I wouldn't describe the blue as any variation of navy; it is much lighter, more like cornflower."
145939,1,MY SON LOVES THIS....HE BOUNCES ALL DAY LONG AND I GET SOME FREE TIME FOR MYSELF!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
16263,1,"I like this blanket, it is big, and folds nicely into a bag of a sort. It did smell horrible when I first opened it, but once I washed it, the smell was gone. It looks to be well constructed, and I like the material it is made of. I am giving it 4 stars because it is heavy, other than that, great!"
184375,1,"I found this and the boppy most useful in the early weeks.I couldn't imagine putting baby girl in the bassinet fresh outof the womb, so this worked perfectly until her legs got too long."
62260,1,"i love these and use them often, my 4yr old loves to wash herself like a big girl and can hold onto these very well to do so."
114564,1,"This seat is great. My baby has been using it since 5 months old and we have even moved the big bulky high chair out of the kitchen. This seat is super easy to clean, no hiding places for crumbs! Folds up just as easily as described. The tray is no hassle to deal with. I first opted for a cheaper Safety 1st seat that looked the same, but was not even close. After unsuccessfully trying to deal with that company to even get a tray that would actually attach to the seat I opted for this one and am so pleased!****UPDATE****My now 3-1/2 year old just stopped using this seat so I thought I would update my review. It's still a 5 star for sure! The only reason he has stopped using it is because we just purchased a new dining table and he can reach well without it. This was probably the best ""baby purchase"" I ever made. It still looks brand new after 3 years of use. Of course, we dropped using the tray a couple of years ago, but it slides nicely under the dining table and worked just as well as a booster without the tray. Awesome product and unlike most other products it was very much worth the price I paid for it!"
63912,1,"Easy way to tighlty swaddle baby. My newborn is so distracted by her own hands - she can't sleep more than twenty minutes without this. The fleece is very soft - but also kind of warm. It's nice for us because we just run the A/C at night and keep her bundled. The noise helps her sleep - and the wrap keeps her nice and warm.** update - now that my daughter is 4 months old and still requires swaddling we upgraded to a bigger size. She busts out of this swaddle constantly now (because of her age, not the new size) - however, she is 4 months old and that's a little old for swaddling :) So if you child is determined to suck on their hands... this won't stop them! Haha."
183250,1,"We bought this for our baby boy because space was extremely limited and I wanted the baby near me. I had read other reviews and decided to get it. Here's what we found:PROS: Pretty easy to put together, very cute and gender neutral, the fact that you can lift the top part and take it out was great for taking baby into another room; the storage basket was also a nice feature; bassinet could also be raised high enough to be close enough to my high bed (height will affect size of storage basket); the price was also affordable for us without being a hugh investment.CONS: The base is really wide, so the legs didn't fit under my bed to really have the bassinet right next to me; also, in a small space you can run into the legs fairly often. The changing table didn't get used because we already had one, but it looked kind of small. The bassinet is kind of small, so if you have a larger baby it will outgrow it real quick (my son was 7,12 at birth and we had to move him out in his 2nd month). If you have a smaller baby, you may want to swaddle them so their hands don't hit the sides and startle them. The mattress is fairly thin and it does sag in the middle which can be uncomfortable for baby, but if you add some support to it it's not too bad.NEUTRALS: My boy wasn't really interested in the little hanging toys, but they were cute. He was also never keen on the little music and sounds or the vibration, but they worked well. The cover could be replaced with any bassinet sheets as long as you weren't using the harness/straps.Overall, it was worth it to me to get this even though we used it for a short time."
96854,1,"We. Love. This. Sheep! :) There is nothing negative I can say about it! We live in an apartment, on the bottom level which means not only do we have neighbors to deal with above us, but also the children playing outside our windows were keeping my baby awake. This super soft sheep drowns out the background noise and since it has volume control I can turn it up as the neighbors get louder and down when it finally is quiet. No more accidental awakenings. I also love that it has the velcro strap so we can take it with us on car rides and in the stroller."
139981,1,I shopped around the internet for this specific item and could not find it any cheaper. The item also arrived very quickly after I ordered it.
160516,0,"Hi - In concept this is a great idea, but I want to make sure people know about certain limitations. Because of the placement of the securing straps, this sheet CANNOT be used on convertible cribs with a solid headboard. You must have slats on all 4 sides of the crib - or be handy with a needle and thread.Just want to make sure people know, as these sheets are expensive and I was very disappointed to learn that I am unable to use them."
87842,1,This is the only mat I bought and I didn't do a ton of research on them but my daughter likes this and it taught her to bat at the hanging objects. I used it for her at daycare so she wouldn't be on the floor. One of the toys makes music when you squeeze it too.
59541,2,"After we finally figured out the instructions for installation (the pictures were so tiny), we installed one correctly. Then, when we tried to install the second one, we found out that our doors aren't solid. The small magnet part fell all the way to the bottom. After 30 minutes of trying to extract the magnet from the door, we finally installed that, but the parts just didn't fit well together. This was more trouble than it was worth, and we purchased the old-fashioned ones. It was also much more expensive than the old-fashioned ones. Oh well, we probably would have lost the magnetic key in a few months anyway."
94172,1,"I actually have the Bumper Jumper, which is much better if you're using this in a standard doorway and you don't want marks on the wall or little hands to get pinched. The bumper provides a nice cushion for that.I was trying to decide between this and the Fisher Price Jumperoo, and it came down to the fact that I didn't want yet another thing taking up unnecessary space, as the Jumperoo seems to do. So, after bringing the Bumper Jumper home and realizing how much freedom she has, I was very happy with the purchase.I mean, not only does she get to jump, but she can spin around, looking from from room to the other. My baby absolutely loves this thing, and so do we...it's very entertaining to watch!"
77583,1,This swing was awesome up until she could sit up on her own (5 months old). We unfortunately waited until she was a couple of months old before we purchased it. That was our biggest mistake! The cradle position allows for it to hold newborns securely and without their necks slumping forward. The lighted mobile catches her attention and she would just follow the butterflies around. The music is soothing (has different settings and volume control). I would even hear the music in my head when the swing wasn't on becuase we played it so much. My baby girl did not like the cradle rocking motion (side to side) and it made her sick when we tried it out. The standard back and forth motion was the only way she enjoyed the swing. I hated the time when she started sitting up on her own because I knew the swing was out the door at that point. I almost forgot one of the best features! It works off either battery (which we never used) or plug into the wall. I couldn't imagine how many batteries we would have gone through as much as we used the swing.
148378,1,We have boy and girl twins who are 30 months old. The size of this little potty is perfect! Both of the twins are 35 inches tall. Our son is 30 lbs and our daughter is 26 lbs. We have had no problems with BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Little Potty. The price is a great value and the vivid colors are fun.
44061,0,so i have a 16 month daughter who bought this for since she really enjoys the bath and loves to stick her head near the faucet. i saw this product on ebay and similar sites but for way more. decided i would go ahead and buy it. its really cute but dosent stay on my faucet very well. we have a fairly new home and the faucets do not look that old so when the water comes out and pushes down on the product it soon falls off. it was a bit of a disappointment but i still just put it back on if it falls off. plus my 16 month old loves to play with it so it really does not serve a purpose in my house except for decoration and being cute. hope this helps!
86133,1,"""Hands down the best thing I received as a baby shower gift. No sound interception at all, excellent image even in pitch dark. You can even see your baby breathing the image is so good. It saved me during sleep training and helped keep me from needlessly entering his room and thus waking him.""Our baby is 13 months now and I have to add that this monitor is now helping us to know if he is sick when he cries out. We know that he has a different sounding cry when he is sick but you can actually see if he has gotten sick because the monitor shows a darkness in the area where he has gotten sick on the sheet. I can immediately run up knowing he needs me. Its also a lot of fun to watch him play when he wakes and waits for us to get him out. I think I'll be using this until he's 18! : )"
8595,2,I liked the 3-n-1 organizer however I am a strictly Avent mom and the bottles don't stay on or in.... I am taking mine back... they need to make the holder rings alittle different...
144272,1,We use these for our baby's diapers when we are out in public. It attaches easily to our bag and is stylish with the red.
175553,2,"I love Sleepsacks, but was disappointed in the swaddling feature of this.Pros:*Great fleece -- soft and thick and washes beautifully*No need for a blanket*Reverse zipper for easy diaper changes*Can use as a regular sleepsack when baby no longer needs to be swaddledCons:*The swaddle band sits too low across my son's chest, so he wiggles one or both arms free, defeating the swaddle*The arm holes are a bit too snug, so it's difficult to get my son into this if he's already asleep; I have other sleep sack-style sleeveless blanket sleepers that snap on the shoulder, which makes getting a sleeping baby settled far more easy*The Velcro strips are huge -- this would be okay if the swaddle band was high enough, but if you don't get this set right at first and you're baby is sleeping, the ripping sounds and strong tugging required wake him up*The reverse zipper is a pro, but also a con -- it can be difficult to hook up the zipper and not disturb a sleeping babyI have used the Kiddopotamus swaddlers, which are great and easy, but when my son outgrew the first size, I thought I would try the Sleepsack style because I could use it as a plain Sleepsack when he didn't need to be swaddled anymore. Because of the challenges with this, though, I will probably go ahead and order the larger size in the Kiddopotamus."
1443,1,"I have 2 aging cocker spaniels whose bladder control isn't as reliable as it used to be. Size 6 fits well. We use these on them during the day if they're alone at home, and at night while sleeping. Keeps them from using the kitchen floor as a bathroom."
63786,1,"Small but very cute! Good things come in small packages sometimes and definitely in this case. Very nice heavy expensive feel to them, without the heavy, expensive price. Nice addition to the nursery! Would be great if they offered these in a bigger form too."
55122,1,"Great stroller and fits our needs perfectly. My 19 month old can get in and out of the stroller by himself. And my Graco baby carseat fits wonderfully in the rear seat. I love that it's easy to fold down and to set back up. The storage compartment on the bottom is spacious and I use the ""mommy"" cup holder and storage everytime we go out for a walk."
99783,1,Pampers are the only diaper to use! I didn't notice a difference between Baby Dry and the Ultra Dry but just know that other brands (Huggies etc) don't even compare to the wetness protection.
53995,0,This is OK.. Its really hard to position and in a smaller car isnt really worth it. I would return it but I already threw away the thing it came in... It's good in a SUV or something like that so I use it in my mom's Blazer and it works good...
28902,2,I returned this after using in for a few days. It was clearly cheap and could be felt in the cheap microfiber which was very scratchy and the cheap foam underneath that held the impression of your butt and feet in the cusions. Not impressed. It's worth spending a little more for more comfort.
67294,0,"We used the previous model of this gate for several years until the release handle broke off. We were using it on a kitchen door to the outside to keep our dog outside while still being able to keep the door open for airflow, and to be able to see the dog. Now we need one to keep our toddler inside the house (when it's not time to be outside playing with the dog). I was very happy with the previous model, as it fit well in the door frame and the big, round pressure pads held the gate firmly in place. Also, the handle slid up and down easily and it was easy to get the gate in place, even with one hand.The newer model requires two hands to put in place, the handle is very hard to push down, and the pressure pads are much smaller. Unless you hold the gate in place, one pressure pad will invariably get left out. Finally, even though the gate is adjusted for maximum pressure, it's still easy for a dog or a child to push the thing over completely. So it does not breed confidence. On the plus side, we're able to close the door with the gate in place. I'd really prefer having the old style, but this will have to do for now.Update: I've been using this for about six months now, and the spring pressure has gotten weaker. I open and close it a few times a day (sometimes I just step over it), and at this point it's mostly just a visual barrier. The kid can push it over with little effort, and the dog will pull it down on occasion. If only my landlord would pay to install a screen door..."
24001,1,"I purchased this Halo Sleepsack for my daughter when she was about 3 months old to help her sleep longer and better in her crib. It did the trick! She felt secure, warm and comfortable and I noticed an immediate change in how long she slept. I like the fact that she can have her arms free and still be bundled in. Another benefit is not having to use blankets. I only wish I could have used it longer but the summer heat has kept me from using it. I am saving it for our next little one."
61734,0,These are a good price. However I don't think they hold just as much liquid as the Luvs that I had previously been using did.
124041,1,"I have been using this for my daughter with her Chicco Keyfit 30 infant car seat since she was a newborn. She is now almost 5 months old and 18 lbs, and we use it every time we go out of the house.PROS:LightweightEasy to open/closeFits into a small trunk or back seat easilyGoes down narrow store aislesTwo cup holders are a nice bonusHandle is high, which is nice for tall people like myself.CONS:Can only be used with an infant seat, so once infant is over 30lbs, it's not useable.Under-stroller basket is pretty small, and VERY awkward to get stuff out of without lifting the car seat up.Straps to help secure the infant seat get easily caught under the wheels or in the hinges between uses."
56474,1,These break often I am almost finished with my second set in a year. They break mostly cause u leave them open when cooking and when u open or close oven n forget to close them they snap in half. But they work well for there purpose and I have not found better.
94086,1,"I have had this warmer for about 3 years now and never had a problem with it. Yeah it may take longer to heat than other warmers ( 10-15 minutes tops with Avent Bottles, 4 and 9 oz.), but with a little bit of PATIENCE and have your baby on a FEEDING SCHEDULE then it works out just fine."
117784,1,"My daughter loves this bouncer! We take it everywhere we go...she loves it so much that she falls asleep in it & gets mad when you take her out! My nephew is one month younger than her (3 1/2 months) & weighs 6 pounds more than my daughter & he does not quite understand the concept yet of jumping--so he doesn't enjoy it as much, but my daughter jumps her little heart out & doesn't want to get out! We even take it from room to room for her!"
37143,0,"My overall impression of this gate is good, it's doing the job it been made for, my daughter can no longer escape from her room. But the gate could be improved in some points.Pros:-the gate is in metal and it's steady-nice simple design-automatic closingCons:-the ""click"" when the gate is closing is loud-not really pressure mounted, you've to use either the nail or stick the ""pads"" to fix the gate to the door-a little bit to small for a 34 inches door, and too large with the extension, we had to extend the screw almost entirely-automatic closing, a bit annoying at night especially, so I've prevent the door to close with a towel-hard to open with one hand, if you're carrying your baby it's hard to do it"
55391,2,"On the day my daughter and I were discharged from the hospital, my mom and dad took my car to have the car seat installed. They had been advised to go to the Police Station or the Fire Department to have this done. The officer who had been called to install the car seat advised them against using the carseat undermat. He stated it would cause the car seat to slide which of course would be unsafe. I was hoping to protect my seat with the carseat undermat, but my daughter's safety is my priority."
51935,0,"This Carrier is a good idea, well made, and easy to put on, but frankly i can't wear it for more than 5 minutes with my 3 and a half month old. Also when she faces out (she's looking around now and doen't want to face in anymore and has great head control) the material pinches her legs. I'd say if you don't have back problems it's great. I will say the mesh material washes well.The way it works is fantastic... face in the baby's head is cradled for when they are newborn, and face out the flap folds down to brace the shoulders. I just can't wear it. Grandma and Dad tried it too and they had the same problem. Back pain within 5 mins.I also tried the PeanutShell carrier and forget it, being lopsided (over the shoulder) my back lost it right away.I'm going to try Moby next... we shall see!"
166427,1,"We tried a few brands, we liked pampers the best. I did this through Amazon Mom (yes, I'm that secure in my masculinity) and it worked well having it on a 4-week delivery cycle. I could forget about having to buy diapers and they would just show up at the door...generally just in time."
15788,1,"I LOVE this - this has to be one of the best baby products for winter. I live in Texas, so wouldn't think I'd need this, but we've had a cold spell, and this thing is a dream. I bought for our upcoming winter trip to New York, but I'm so glad it arrived early. It's really cozy and I can go for a run or out on errands and my baby stays warm and toasty without overheating. It's super soft and snuggly. My baby is 7.5 months, but long for her age, so I went ahead and got the toddler size. It's a little long, but I look forward to using it for years to come."
177383,2,"We received this pump as a gift from our registry &amp; were very excited---until I used it. It is time consuming to use, cannot maintain suction &amp; use of it is almost enough to make me want to give up breast feeding entirely!Save your money &amp; invest in another pump!!"
144923,1,My son has loved his WubbaNub pacifiers since he was born. We do not leave home without one (or two) with us. He loves to hold on to the animals. I give these as gifts to all new moms!The frog is extra bright and colorful. Love it!
118009,1,"I have no idea how this thing works, but it does! I don't know what some of the negative reviewers are talking about...maybe they got a ""dud"", because I have never had a problem with mine. Although, once I dropped it and that set it off - so I did have to boil it again. I wouldn't say it is ""super sensitive"" though, since it was a pretty hard fall to the floor. Showing it off to friends one day, it was passed around and handled alot and it never set off the heating disk. Also, I don't know how people can say it is difficult to use...boiling water to re-activate it has never been that difficult for me.I didn't give it 5 stars because it is a little heavy to be carrying around in the diaper bag, and it does take a bit longer to heat up the Playtex Nurser bottles since it has to work through the plastic outer bottle before it can get to the milk in the liner (it helps to swirl it around a bit while it heats). All-in-all, I don't know what some people were expecting, but this bottle warmer was $9.99 well spent! When you see your baby is getting hungry - or better yet - know about what time they will want to eat, just click it and go!"
34051,2,Fit our Britax perfectly but did rip on way back from Hawaii. Maybe the multiple exchanges was too stressful for the bag.
58522,1,This is the best baby accessory you can get to help with the constant bottle sterilizing that you have to do. I don't know how I would get so much done without it. It is a great time saver.
98799,1,"i've been busy cleaning up wet & messy leaks and washing dirty undershirts & clothes for 8 months when my friend suggested that i switch from luvs to pampers. now that my baby NEVER leaks onto her clothes and i have no dirty undershirts to soak i regret not having known earlier that it wasnt my baby who's messy, it was the luvs that didn't suit her no matter what size i tried. pampers are definitely more expensive than luvs but they're so worth it!"
26008,0,"I just bought this highchair and it looks fabulous...it's black and white and very modern to match my house. HOWEVER, the tray doesnt come close to my son, who is 8 mos and he makes a HUGE mess. The tray is so far from his body, everything falls into his lap. It's just a little annoying for the price."
63784,0,"these are adorable letters, but don't miss that they are only a couple inches in size. i returned them because they sent his first letter w/o the other two, but nonetheless wanted letters that were the ""typical"" size you see in stores, about 6 inches."
101237,1,Great Absorbtion and really does the job.they are easy to put on and have never leaked. they are worth every penny.
22355,1,Love the way this folds. Did not even need instructions. Great price for this item. I would recommend this pack n play to everyone.
85926,1,"We had a simple fisher price sound monitor (Fisher-Price Sounds 'N Lights Monitor) which was really great with no static. But when our child would cry, make funny noises or other ""suspicious"" sounds, we didn't know if it was a pacifier issue, heat, blanket and always needed to investigate what it was, read, daddy or mommy needed to go check.So we decided that it would be nice to see our son when he cries,So we researched it online, and everyone seemed pretty positive, yet a few reviews were pretty negative. So we decided to take the ""plunge"" and bought it.Now, when our son complains, makes funny noises or we just want to see him sleep, we have the Summer Infant Day & Night.Here is the scoop......Pros:- Night vision is REALLY good - my wife and I love to observe our child at night when he is at peace - yet we are not waking him up.- Microphone is VERY sensitive, so you can hear your baby's breathing (for us, we have the camera (which has the microphone integrated into it) on a shelf above his head- The portability of the monitor is great- The size of the screen is great, not too small, not too big- The ""on/off"" button for the video is great especially at night - without it our whole bedroom would be lit up- The length of the cords from adapter to monitor and adapter to camera is greatCons:- Sometimes, the static from other neighborhood wifi devices or others seems to interfere - we are OK, but sometimes it seems that it picks up other devices' frequencies- the cord from the adapter to camera can easily come off - Summer should had a small latch that ensures the cord doesn't fall off so easily- The monitor's battery case is sealed with philips screws - that doesn't make sense for a baby monitor which is never going to be given to a baby therefore really doesn't need this extra security. If it was a fake monitor sure, add the screws but for an adult oriented product - it is unnecessary."
156286,1,I cannot imagine my daughter sleeping with out her wearable blanket. It keeps my 20 month old daughter comfortable and she sleeps through the night because she doesn't get cold.
111990,1,I bought this as a gift for a baby shower. Was a little worried about the stitching not being pink but on the red side but when I received the bag it was hot pink and so adorable! I love it. The zebra print looks fuzzy like a zebra then has the laminated material over it.
131736,1,I was happy with the size of the posters. They fit in greatly with the room decor. I would purchase these again.
113385,1,"This monitor is the best! I really love the fact that both units can be cordless, the baby unit is rechargable, the range is amazing, and it is so clear that you can easily hear the baby breathing! After four years and two kids (and some seriously hard wear and tear) we needed to replace ours and went with another brand because of some extra little features that sounded fun. I could not believe how horrible it was in comparison! (It was Safety 1st by the way.) I realized that the silly features some monitors offer are useless if overall the product DOESN'T WORK. Needless to say we are returning it and going with what we know is tried and true."
121143,0,"This infant seat has been useful, primarily to keep my newborn baby close by while I cook, clean, etc. For my son it has essentially served as a portable ""crib"" while he naps, or as a place for him to rest for 5-10 minutes at a time while he's awake. I do like that this seat offers an alternative to having him lie flat on his back...and it also offers a more relaxed body position for the baby compared to his regular car seat (where he is more upright). Unfortunately I was very disappointed to discover that the music & vibration do not calm, entertain, stimulate or otherwise appear to affect my baby at all! I thought the vibration mode would be more stimulating or bouncy, but it is SO subtle! Since this is my first baby - and my first vibrating infant seat - I don't know if all such seats offer the same (lack of) intensity, but if they do then I guess my baby is just immune to the ""magic"" vibrations (at least so far, and he is already 3+ months old)!"
58827,2,"I liked Avent Bottles, my daughter Liked them too! Then I found out about Bisphenol -A being used to make the Bottles. After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. Do your own research. I'm really surprised the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated."
58665,1,"I have gotten alot of use out of my sterilizer. It's nice that it only takes 4 minutes in an average microwave to get 4 bottles or one breast pump and 2 bottles sterilized. My only complaint is that the items stay wet and have to be dried off which means they're not sterile anymore, I think."
49140,1,"This item is rugged, can change shapes to fit in different size spaces and panels can be removed to change size."
155407,2,Very Flimsy and does not stand up when there is the lightest wind. It also blows away easily. They should include a stake for it but they don't.
100003,0,"I started my baby with the Pampers Swaddlers and was very happy, so as she grew, I purchased more Pampers. However, I have now made the move to Huggies. My little girl goes to the bathroom in large quantities and frequently. I found that the Pampers weren't as absorbent as the Huggies and didn't absorb fast enough. I also feel like the Huggies are made out of better quality materials. Less like a plastic pants. The Pampers are fine, better than Luvs, but I'm going to stick with Huggies for now."
39797,1,We bought this product for our newborn who is now 16 months old and loves it! She was a major crier and the only wayt to calm her down was the ocean sounds. It was amazing. It is nice when we travel because you can plug it in anywhere or put batteries in it. It is the best sound machine i have had in years!!!! My Wife and I have the monitor on so that we can just hear the waves. She has always slept throughout the night. I am thinking about getting it for our 4yr old. I hope this help:)
90378,1,"I've always used Pampers. I was impressed when I first bought them for my son and the diaper was wet, but he wasn't. Good product, am using them for my daughter."
110656,0,"Despite my best efforts, this does not sit flush with my bed. I bought the leg extender, so it is the correct height, but because I have a bed frame, there is about 2 inches between the cosleeper and the bed. Maybe it's just me, but I expected it to be flush with my bed so I could more easily get the baby in and out. This is a step up from the bassinet, but not as great as I expected."
126867,1,"Diapers work great for my son - never had any leaks, and amazon ""mom"" seems to have the best prices around."
161640,2,"When we first started using this tub we thought it was great, but our son is now 5 months old and we hate it. When we started placing it in the bathtub for baths because our son was splashing all around we had so many problems. The suction cups would stick so hard to the tub that it was impossible to move it away from the faucet without spliing the whole thing or the bottem becoming unsnappped which caused leaks. We removed the suction cups, but the tub still has a steady leak. It's hard enough to bath a slippery baby - don't choose this tub that causes even more trouble."
155648,2,"I guess I did not understand exactly what I was ordering. I thought this was a potty seat that hooked to any toilet, and I could take it anywhere and he could use it anywhere. This is not a rational purchase. This is like a port-a-potty... Who is going to let their child use the bathroom out in the complete open?"
158690,1,"A friend of mine introduced me to the sleep sak, and we love it! Much safer than a blanket, and very comfortable for our son. The zipper can get caught every now and then, but otherwise, a product we'll definately use for our next child."
59219,2,"I'm a new mom and I am a big believer in the Avent line of products. This bottle warmer, however, is not one of their more stellar efforts. The instructions say that once the bottle has reached the appropriate temperature (which the device is supposed to know, based on the amount of time for which you've set the dial), the warmer will maintain the warm temperature until such time that you're ready to use the bottle. Well, it does, in fact, warm the bottle, but the machine just keeps making the bottle hotter and hotter! I put a bottle into the warmer and got distracted by my little one for a few minutes. When I went back to get the bottle, so that I could feed him, I was shocked to discover that it was so scalding hot that I could barely touch it! Not only is this inconvenient, it could also be very dangerous! After only two uses, this warmer has a new home on the top shelf of my pantry, where it will likely sit until the end of time. Save yourself the money and just warm your bottles by putting them in a bowl of hot water. Much easier, less time-consuming, and cheaper!!"
14654,1,"I have been using the Avent bottle system for six months and have been completely satisfied. I introduced an Avent bottle to my daughter at four weeks old and she transitioned easily between breast and bottle. She is still breastfed in the morning and evenings but receives an Avent bottle at daycare and has never had a problem. I have never had a bottle leak of which other consumers have complained. I would recommend this system to any parent, especially those of part-time breastfed babies."
16704,1,"I was pretty determined that my son would skip the sippy cup and go straight to the straw and it was these cups that allowed for the transition! Other no-spill cups with straws have valves inside the straw that reduce the flow of liquid, which I found difficult for me to drink against, nevermind my 1 year old. He would get frustrated with these straws because he couldn't get anything out of them!These straws do not have the valve, but another plastic piece that reduces the liquid's flow. Plus, there are cute designs for both boys and girls!"
179612,2,"Short story: Avoid bringing a car seat on the plane if at all possible. This product works, but is still a near-complete waste.Long story:I recently traveled to Florida with my 20 month-old daughter. I decided to purchase her a seat on the plane. I thought it best that she sit in a car seat while on the plane since it's supposed to be the safest option. Since I was traveling alone, I needed a way to cart around her car seat throughout the trip. This product looked like the perfect fit.It worked as advertised. My Evenflo Triumph car seat attached according to the instructions. The TravelMate is sturdy and easy to maneuver. I did have a little trouble with attaching and detaching the wheels, but it wasn't so bad.Then, the problems began.-My child was very frighted by the incline while being carted around on the TravelMate. So, I just carried her and wheeled the seat behind me to the first flight. It worked very well in that regard and supported the weight of my checked luggage (40 pounds). I planned ahead so I just had one light back pack as carry on.-The car seat would not fit down the plane's aisle, nor would the travel mate. A flight attendant had to lug the thing forward for me. Very embarrassing. Once at our seats, I detached the Travelmate fairly easily and attempted to secure the car seat. Not only could I not tighten the lap belt enough to secure the car seat, once installed my daughter's feet hit the seat in front of her. The passenger in that seat immediately turned around and began complaining about being ""kicked."" My daughter was less than 3 feet tall but her legs were bowed. There really wasn't any way to keep her feet from hitting the seat. After a bit of struggling, I just gave up and placed her on my lap.- Getting off the plane was time-consuming and also required assistance from surly flight attendants. I rushed to my connecting flight and checked the car seat and TravelMate at the gate. My daughter stayed on my lap for the remaining flights, prompting the ""how old is your child?"" ""why is this seat next to you empty?"" and ""you know, you can bring a car seat onto the plane with you"" inquiries from the flight attendants. The latter of which received the reply: ""yes, I'm aware of that and tried it but it was an absolute nightmare."""
22907,1,"I was drawn in by the affordable price of $29 by the original manufacturer seller here on this site, but fell in love with the ease of use, quality, and gorgeous beauty of the fashionable fabric of this product. This a good ring sling for a beginning baby wearer! It is a hybrid sling with both some of the easier pouch sling qualities, but the adjustability of a ring sling. The partially closed tail makes it that you can't get the fabric twisted and tangled and makes it easy to thread. The sling edges is padded so the baby doesn't get red marks on his legs or head like the non-padded slings, but the padding is very light compared to other padded edged slings which normally are overwhelmingly thick and make you hot. The light padding actually goes through the rings unlike the padding of other padded slings which normally don't, making this sling as adjustable to as tightly small as you want to make it. Besides the light padding not being hot, the fabric was breathable for both the baby and me. Very important when you live in year long hot Florida like me."
112110,1,"After trying the store brands, regular pampers, luvs, and the others, I settled on the cruisers for my daughter. In the 18 months I've been using them for her, I can count on one hand the number that have leaked or come undone. They are that good. With diapers you really do get what you pay for. Every other one I tried leaked, wouldn't fasten well, you name it. I think these are especially good for more active children as they come a little up the back, so when she is crawling/playing around the top doesn't start to slide down. The cruisers really perform and you will make up for the extra cost in saved time cleaning up after the other brands."
83991,1,"We like to take our baby boy (13 months) dining with us and sit him in a high chair at the edge of our table. My wife got a cover for restaurant high chairs, which can be amazingly sticky, and she brings along Clorox disinfecting wipes for other things within easy reach. This is the flu season, after all, and this year it's the swine flu we're talking about. Well, we try to protect the little guy, but his hands just get all over the table and everything else within reach, and then head straight for his mouth, of course. This past week my wife added a Kiddopotamus Tiny Diner Place Mat to our protective devices. It fits on any strange tables we encounter and it works very well.It works well on the home table as well, but here the emphasis is different. At home it's protection for the table, rather than for the kid. In either case, it fastens down with small suction cups. The little boy can smear stuff all over it and we can easily peel the mat off and give it a washing. Real Handy. It even has a little trough on the table-edge side to catch inevitable spillage in that direction. We chose the blue, but the green would have been just as good. We're going to get a lot of use out of this nifty little accessory.Gary Peterson"
172400,1,"I bought this the other day for my 3 1/2 month old. She loved being able to sit up in the tub! She would grab toys as they floated by. It was still a bit big for her since she doesn't sit up that well by herself, but I just stuck a towel behind her and it worked perfectly. I think this will be great for the transition from infant bath tub to sitting up in the big tub."
35929,1,"This is my 3rd baby, my 2nd attempt at baby wearing. My son was 10lbs at birth and carrying him in a sling qucikly hurt my upper back. I used a heart2heart at a play group, but it was out if my price range. MIL bought me this wrap and I am so greatful. I can wear baby and push my 2 year old in an umbrella stroller. No buky double stroller! I'm able to do house work and tend to my other two. I can wear her for hours while shoping, and I have. A sling was painful after 10 minutes or so. I read s comment about no head support for tummy-to-tummy. What I do is take the piece over my shoulder, opposite of what her head is facing and pull it over. She's mostly covered, but still has her face out the breathe. I've had her in the wrap since she was a week old. That's when I got it. I found the easiest way to get her out from tummy-to-tummy when she's sleeping is slide my arm under the fabric and hold her body. With your other hand, slide the piece of fabric all the way off and then the other side. Voila! Lift baby up a little and she is out. As you can see, I'm a big fan of this wrap. I do find it can get a little hot in the house, but any carrier will. You have body heat right against you. I often wear it all day to avoid putting it on again. You just have to flatten the pieces holding the baby again. However, it is easy to put on. I got it after watching the video twice. It does drag on the floor when you put it on, but I like the other poster's suggestion of putting it on before you leave home. I find it rim enough to wear under my leather jacket, as I often do once DD is in her car seat when leaving a mall. Please, try this if want to wear your baby with the versatility of 5 different positions and without back pain as it's spread across both shoulders and the lower back."
39234,1,"I bought this pillow so I could match paint for the walls and other fabrics for the room without buying the bumper pads--it has a swatch of the floral, eyelet, sage green, and leopard print. It is a very pretty pillow!"
151958,1,"The Mommy's helper Slide-lok Bifold Door Lock gets the job done. I may order a couple more for other bi-fold doors. I was slightly disappointed that the ""handle"" was short and only on one side, but it definitly does what it is intended to do. In my oppinion, it's a good deal."
29282,1,"Nice and lightweight. It wasn't as tall as the one I had when my kids were little, but it was tall enough for my grandson to was his hands."
99255,1,"We tried Luvs, Huggies, and Pampers Swaddlers and we consistently had leaks during nap time as our little guy is a champion when it comes to making water. These baby dry diapers have cut down the leaks from several a day to maybe one every 3 or 4 days. Needless to say, we like them a lot!"
145748,1,"The Amazon price on this item is great and delivery was super fast. Overall, we've been very pleased with this jumperoo. It provides a lot of entertainment, he loves the music and the lights, and it is easy enough for a 5-month-old baby to jump in for a good 30 minutes at a time.Assembly is quick, though the seat cushion was a bit of a challenge. I had to ask my husband to help because it seems to require more effort than what I was willing to spare.The jumperoo is not very bulky, though just like any other similar toy, it does up quite some space in our room. I like the round base because it is easier to fit if you are looking to out it in a corner. It is also relatively lightweight (I am able to lift and move it with one hand while holding a 17-pound baby in my other hand) and easy to move (I like to take it to the kitchen while I am making dinner).I think the best thing about this jumperoo is the toys. My baby loves them all - from the ones up above and especially the little lizard rattle. I also like that the seat is cushy (in case your baby is like mine and jumps like crazy) and that the fabric can be removed to be washed (my son chews on his seat with great pleasure).All in all, a great purchase.And here's a video of my little guy using this jumperoo (in case you don't believe it's fun): [...]"
182369,1,"I registered for this and I didn't realize that it would be difficult to find covers for due to the depth created by the four sides, which is why it lost one star. After reading the reviews I registered and received theSummer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Tan/Green (Frog)cover another reviewer said fit and linked to. It did not fit, it tented quite a bit. So I ordered another cover a reviewer said fit,American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Minky Dot Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover, White Puff. These were a couple dollars cheaper than the Carter's version that other reviewers said fit despite the dimensions being the same as the Summer Pals cover. The American Baby fit much better but is by no means perfect, it still tents but not nearly as much and is made for pads an inch bigger in every dimension however the strap slots aren't in an ideal position. I was worried the tenting would cause the covers to rip or wear faster once the weight of the baby was on them or if they shrank after washing, or would come off mid change. If I hadn't thrown away the box I would have returned this one and purchased the 30"" version of the pad and I think the ""standard"" covers or the American Baby cover would have worked great. If you are handy with a sewing machine you may be able to make covers that fit perfectly by making them an inch bigger in the depth than the American Baby covers.As for the cover itself it is of regular changing pad quality, perhaps a bit more padding than cheaper models. It's vinyl so it is easy to disinfect with a mild bleach solution. I like that it has four sides with a good depth to help keep baby from rolling around on me while changing and trying to scoot off the end or top of the pad. It just feels more secure and protects the baby's head a bit more from accidents. Overall save yourself the frustration and buy the 30"" version you may have better luck finding covers and save some money."
91224,2,I put this monitor on my gift registry and it was the worst. It did work for all of two weeks than all you could hear was static no matter what I did it did not change.
101738,1,"I love the Chicco Liteway but we know with all umbrella strollers, there is limited basket space. This fits my needs perfect for the day at the zoo or any other trip that will last about half a day. The bag is small as other post have said but it fit a lot!I have the following in my bag:Front zipper pocket: Child size spoon and fork, 4 wet ones singles, kleenex, neosporan spray, and a small first first aid kitInside pocket: Two size 5 diapers, ziplock bag of wipes, arm and hammer diaper baggy, disposable changing pad, a pack of table toppers, neutrogena sunblock for body and the face sunblock, ace instant compress, a light weight wind jacket, and a change of clothes.I can now put this on the outside and put just our lunch box in the basket. I'm IN LOVE!"
176433,1,"I bought this pump 8 years ago! I have three kids that were all nursed for 12-15 months each. I would not trade it for anything. The only other thing that has lasted 3 kids is my Pack-N-Play. This pump has worked reliably and conviently. I had it in a ziplock bag in my purse. It is not the quietest thing, but it is SMALL. There has to be a trade off somewhere. Medela is a great brand and all the accessories are usuable with their other systems, if you choose otherwise. I gave it to a relative and she said it is still working great too. The quality is there."
159508,1,"My baby girl has severe reflux problems and needs to be in an inclined position for most of the time. So, she has been almost always in the bouncer whenever she is done with her feeds. Many-a-times this bouncer has prevented her from throwing-up, which she does when lying flat on a mattress or on the floor.Initially she did not like the bouncer and was crying a lot when placed in it. Later she started liking it and at some point, learnt to bounce it herself by kicking her legs. It is a great sight to see her bouncing herself and she does it for long periods of time. The hanging bees are clearly eye-catching for the baby, because she pulls them down in a few mins after being seated in the bouncer. She also pulls the music-handle quite often and entertains herself consistently. When she is fussy, I turn the soothing-vibrations on and it definitely helps her calm down.The fabric retains its bright colors even after many washes and the battery performance is amazing too. This bouncer has not given us any problem and works the same way since the day we received it. Overall, I'm very pleased that I got this bouncer as it has served its purpose admirably."
114992,1,"We have a large opening that regular baby gates wouldn't fit. I found this gate and my husband assured me that it would rip off the wall in a few short months. 4 years and 2 kids later we finally took it down ourselves!! I can't believe it lasted that long...I would have been happy if it just lasted through my first born's crawling months! It even lasted through the kids swinging from it, hanging on it, driving their tricycles into it, etc. Be sure to install it in a stud or using anchors. My husband used super long screws....not the ones it came with originally."
153943,1,"These wipes are well worth the extra money. We have been using these for our second child since learning about them. They are soft to the touch and not too soapy. Our first child had numerous diaper rashes that were irritated further by the more commercial big name brands. Since using these wipes we have had no ""burn"" feeling issues for either of our children. And the older child will tell you she wants these wipes only."
148992,0,"I was a decently big girl before I became pregnant, and I needed something with more support than a standard body pillow could provide anyway. After looking at several maternity pillows on Amazon.com, I decided on this one.At first, the pillow was fantastic! Although the seam was slightly irritating, as it has been mentioned in several other reviews, it didn't much bother me. I either wasn't very much bothered by it, or I used a flatter pillow to cover it up if it ever did become a problem. The first several nights, I slept very well. It supported me well and I was able to sleep through the night completely pain free, whereas I had had issues with horrible back pain waking me up after only a few hours' sleep previously. As time has gone by, the pillow is losing its shape. I feel it's much too soon for it to be flattening out like this. I have to use the flatter pillow over the seam more to support my head than to hide the seam now. Regardless, I still get a relatively comfortable rest from the pillow. I'm still able to go through a whole night with no back pain, even though it's lost its shape some, and I expect it to lose its shape even more as time passes. So, I still think it was a good investment and I'm glad I bought it."
147406,0,"I am a bit disappointed with this stroller, as it does not have a front wheel that swivels, thus making it difficult to turn. Otherwise, the stroller is very sturdy and provides a smooth ride. Just wish that making turns was a little bit easier."
122409,1,"There are about 30 large star items (like the big star & swirl you can see on the front of the box) + many, many small, medium, and large stars for constellations + 2 sheets of tiny stars for the milky way.Our astrophysicist-majoring son put these up for our elementary-age son with about 1/2 of the summer-sky constellations (which works out perfect for spacing as well as the number of stars in the package) and it was a great bonding time for them and a memory every night when the lights go out. There is a constellation map right in the package, so you'll have everything you need to do that.We have ""popcorn"" type CEILINGS and found that a hot glue gun is the ticket for getting the plastic stars to stick while the small stars on the adhesive sheets will stick just fine. The ticky-tack in the package worked well for the few stars we put on the WALLS in the corner of the room.Yes it takes some time to build this project, but it's one that will bring a lot of joy night after beautiful night.Bon Appetit!"
2932,2,"I was told by friends how WONDERFUL the Boppy was, and also registered for it due to the number of rave reviews. However, I took it to the hospital with me and found that it is not as versatile as expected. It didn't fit around my waist, causing a huge crease in the middle. A friend suggested and actually sent me a &quot;My Brest Friend&quot;, which I thought would sit in the closet but it actually turned out better. It has an adjustable velcro belt, so even Daddy (who is pretty big) can use it for bottle feedings. As suggested by others, you should really try them out before you spend the money."
96532,0,"I read the other reviews for this item and was really excited. I wanted a wooden highchair and the other reviews made it sound like just what I was looking for. I ordered online so that I wouldn't have to drive 30 miles to the nearest Babies R Us. When the chair arrived, I began assembly and discovered the backrest portion of the chair had a significant crack separating the different layers of wood. It was obviously damage that occurred during manufacturing and not during shipping. Good news is that Babies R Us allowed me to bring the chair to them (driving the 30 miles I had hoped to avoid driving) and did an exchange. Of course they didn't have the Ballard in stock and I ended up with the ""B is for Bear"" model of the same chair. Slightly annoying but not a big deal. When I got the new chair home, I found there was slight warping on the plastic tray table. Noticeable but doesn't impact use of the tray table (and not worth taking the SECOND chair back to the store for an exchange) but still a slight flaw that looks like it occurred during manufacturing.Overall chair is heavy, solid and sturdy. Assembly was really easy. My son is just getting the hang of holding his head up and the backrest is solid enough to give him the support he needs. The chair design integrates well with my dining room set. If I had to do it all over again, I would probably buy the same chair since I haven't seen many other wooden chairs in my price range. I would probably purchase at the store rather than online and would inspect the chair in the car before taking it home."
8239,1,This basket appears to be fairly well made. It is bigger than I expected. The literature that came with it is informative.
151361,1,I just installed it today and like so much more than the Brica mirror we had. It stays securely in the position you want and is easily adjustable.
88684,1,"These diapers are light yet absorb alot. I recomend these for price, quality and quanity. They however do not absorb all of my sons night pee.( I think he is a big night pee'er) I had to go a size up for his night diapers.Amazon makes buying these in large quanities so easy, you really do not have to look any where else for better deals. I have done all of my shopping, testing and comparing of diapers and these when bought on amazon auto pay and ship are thee best deal out there hands down!"
128336,2,"I found this for cheap at a local store, and decided to get it for home and travel. My twin girls (18 months) are a little weary of the toilet already, and I know if I tried to put them on this thing, it would ruin any progress we've made. It is totally flimsy, and unstable on our toilet (elongated seat). It does not cover the whole seat, and it doesn't attach to the toilet in any way. When I set it on the seat to fit it, it ended up falling in! Not only that, but it looks like it the hinges would pinch little thighs. I threw it in the trash and bought the baby bjorn potty seat-- it is so stable and comfortable for my girls. I would advise anyone to spend the extra $$ and get a decent potty seat, as this thing is a total waste of money!!!"
75654,0,"The oak color is an exact match to the crib and changing table. That was nice too see. It took over 3 hours to assemble (with 2 people) however it seems pretty sturdy. 2 main complaints... The drawers appear to be deep based on the picture. I was very disappointed when we assembled the drawers. The sides and backs of the drawers are about half the depth of the front wooden piece. They are very shallow. I suppose I can stack clothes carefully and hope to take advantage of the wasted space. I have no idea why they designed the drawers this way. Also, the top is narrow and would make a dangerous changing table. My baby could slip off the front.Time will tell how it holds up structurally."
170109,1,"We just bought this crib in cherry for my daughter. It really is a beautiful crib. The color is gorgeous, the size is perfect for her nursery, and I love that it will convert to a toddler bed when she gets older. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
25381,1,We have been using the standard child locks throughout our house but we had a few drawers where the countertop overhung too much and we couldn't get our fingers in between to unlock the drawer. These magnet locks work perfectly. I would like to put these throughout the house if they were cheaper. They work really well but its a good idea to order some extra magnet keys. My wife keeps losing them throughout our house and we get locked out of our drawers!
75735,0,"The dresser is badly made. The dimensions are the outer part. A changing pad will NOT fit on the top. It is only 29 inches wide even though it says 35in in the description. Box was beat up. There are clamp marks, scuffs, and poor craftmanship apparent all over the cabinet. I wish I had just bought something local instead of on Amazon. Other Sork Craft products are good. I don't understand what the deal is with the dresser. It keeps getting low marks."
61975,0,"Was supposed to receive shipment today and still have not received it. I enjoy receiving it in the mail, as this means I do not have to try and make a special trip 40 miles into town to pick up a big box, but it is inconvenient when I am told one day and it doesn't arrive until a day or 2 later. I end up needing to make a trip for a small supply to get us through."
115290,1,"This is the ONLY product that could contain our brittany puppy. We tried two different styles of the extra tall baby gates, one even had a clear insert instead of the grate and she still managed to get over it. This gate is on our kitchen door, it is attractive, very easy to get thru and our brittany does not attempt to climb or jump it. I highly recommend this product!"
158737,1,"I keep buying these in bigger and bigger sizes for my daughter. I am about to order her an extra large. She just turned 1 and is still in it for all naps and at night. I used the fleece one in the winter but now I stick with the 100% cotton. It is so soft and washes great (though it does shrink a little), and wears well also. To my daughter it is comfort object, almost a lovey. She just gathers up the material to her face and loves on it to get to sleep. She knows it is night-night time when I put this on her. I give them to everyone I know who is pregnant! I agree with other reviewers that say to just go straight for the small instead of newborn size.And to answer the reviewer that doesn't like the inverted zipper - I would think there are 2 reasons it is that way - first you can unzip it halfway for diaper changes without removing it, and second it makes it harder for baby to accidently(or on purpose) unzip herself. I think it is fine and have had no trouble zipping ""down"" even in the dark."
96643,1,"This is a necessary addition to our family. It is so nice to have a white noise function, so I don't have to say &#34;Shhhhh&#34; for hours and hours. The two first sounds are great for entertaining baby, the white noise helps calm baby, and the 'womb' sound is good once the baby is calm, and it helps baby fall asleep. It's also easy to attach to the crib or put on the stroller or take along in the car. I would recommend this to any new parent who'd like to give their voice a break and keep baby calm."
4366,1,I got this for my sister b/c she needed one for her joovy stroller and wanted the joovy one...this one was similar to the brand name one but way inexpensive. She said she actually liked it better than the real thing...more storage!!!
159081,1,"I bought this and a few other Boppy covers and this is by far my favorite. It's easy to wash, doesn't pill and is extremely soft. I would highly recommend it!"
49510,1,"I purchased this item to keep our new puppy in during the day when we are at work. It has been working out great. She has enough space to play at one end and I put down puppy pads at the other end, just in case she would have any accidents. I would recommend this product to any new dog owners.Also the purchase experience was wonderful. I ordered in through Amazon and within 3 days I had the product. Great Service!!!"
122145,1,"I originally wanted a Baby Bjorn carrier as every magazine claims that it is the best. While that may be, the price put it just out of reach for the amount of use I planned to get out of it. I looked for a similar carrier, not cutsy and easy to use and found this model.My husband and I can easily switch off using this carrier even though we need different strap settings. We can make the switch in a few seconds, loosen here, tighten there, and we are off.While we love and use our stroller alot, we have found that there are alot of places that stollers are not convenient and having a good carrier is a lifesaver. Examples- carriage ride in Charleston-no car seat, Maid of the Mist at Niagara, walking through crowded markets and fairs.If you don't want to give up the freedom of travel you had before becoming parents, get a good carrier. This one even becomes a backpack carrier. Young kids enjoy the improved view and you can be free from slavery to 8 tons of gear. This one also has a much higher weight limit than some others I looked at and even in the summer doesn't get as hot as I was prepared for. The childs weight is well ditributed so your back is not breaking either.The only advantage I see in the more expensive models is added style-a little more feminine but then my husband wouldn't use it. This model adjusts the same a baby bjorn to accomodate infants floppy heads and can be unfastened to release a sleeping baby into bed.So for a savings of at least $50 consider this model first."
61308,1,"About the complaint, of course is gonna stink if you pretend not to dispose it for days. I am pregnant for second time, I use it for my first baby and plan to use it with my second baby too. I clean it every night, and never have a problem. If you need it to avoid taking the diaper out for a few days, you wasting your time. But at least you wont have to go out to disposed the garbage every time you change your baby. Works for me and if you are neat enough, will work for you."
105009,0,"I decided to order this after reading all the mixed reviews. I followed directions installing it and let it sit for three days without touching it. Our ten month old daughter pulled it off as soon as we let her near it. Now it does it's job as long as we go along and push the entire strip down before she is playing near it; then it holds for awhile. We're not real impressed with the stickiness, or lack thereof (maybe it's the type of bricks we have), but do feel much safer having her play there once we've pushed it down again. I'm sure even this amount of stickiness will eventually wear off.Edited a few months later: It didn't take long for the foam pieces to lose ALL stickiness. We do still like having it there in case of a fall, though our daughter does love to run off with the pieces."
150234,0,"I cannot attest to the quality of this product because I returned it. It seemed of good quality and was very soft. However, the ""sage"" color is closer to lime. If your nursery colors are truly sage, then this very bright green will not fit in."
86678,1,The fabric doesn't stay well attached. Not top quality product but does the job nicely. Baby sleeps in it no prob. I like that the sun shade can be removed.
93922,1,"I love table toppers. We currently live in Asia and travel all over the world. We've used them in Japan, China and in the USA. Food gets spilled off plates, dumped on tables and plopped in little kids mouths. With table toppers we KNOW that the surface they are eating off isn't filled with germs.My daughters like to rip them off the table occasionally, but we found that the trick is to fasten the edge close to them over the edge of the table and wait to put them down until right before the food arrives, that way they are more focused on the food than the placemat."
86334,1,"I love this monitor! The picture is so good that I can even see my twins breathing on the monitor while they are sleeping. Sometimes I get a bit of static, but I just move the monitor a couple of inches and the problem is corrected. I have had this product for ten months and just yesterday the picture stopped working. I can still hear sound, but the picture is gone. I just called Summer and they are going to send me a replacement. Great customer service to back this product!"
148492,1,"This mirror was difficult to install, and yes, parts of the reflection are a little distorted, but the mirror serves its purpose. I can check on my son without having to turn around. No more than this thing costs, it does its job so I can't complain."
120404,1,"My husband and I did a lot of internet searching for a baby monitor. I wanted to go with a cheep one, but my husband insisted on this monitor. I AM SO GLAD HE DID!!!When our daughter began sleeping through the night, I did not need to worry. The motion sensor feature of the monitor showed me she was still breathing fine. The sound quality of the transmiter and reciver is excellent. I can hear everything in her room, including a ticking clock on the other side of the room :)There is no fuzz and no whines to be heard (except from baby).The extra $ is well worth it. It gave me peace of mind every night. My husband is telling me, ""I told you so.""If you can find some way to afford this monitor, GET IT!!!"
67062,0,The bowl is really nice and sturdy but the suction doesn't work very well. It does not stay put. But the suction piece comes off so it can just be used as a nice bowl.
35363,1,"I bought the Protect-a-Bub shade for my newly purchased jogging stroller. It is fantastic! The biggest issue I have with most strollers is the lack of shade provided to the child.This shades my daughter about 80% when I put it on. It is easy to use and folds out of the way it its own little pouch when not in use. It has ties to attach it to the stroller, which are handy and allow me to customize the way it fits on the stroller.There are a few drawbacks, like it does make folding the stroller difficult if you are out and about. Since my jogging stroller is so big, I do not end up folding it up much when I am out. My daughter is a toddler, so she can crawl in and out fairly easily with this on, but it could be troublesome if the child was small. Additionally, it is a little funny looking (looks like the stroller is wearing an old fashioned ladies hat).But the shade it gives her more then makes up for it! She never gets burned in the stroller. Additionally, we live close to multiple theme parks. This makes hot sunny days bearable for her in her stroller. She can sit or nap with ease and shaded from the hot sun. When the shade is not needed for the day, I untie it and pop it back into its little carry bag. Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for additional shade on their stroller."
13956,2,"We have used these bottles since my son was born. He is now 17 months old and he still uses them for his night time bottle. They do leak, and it is frustrating, but we have learned how to make them stop.....we push down hard while turning the cap and that seems to stop the leak. Hope that this advice helps, it has helped us."
32127,2,"I bought this carseat case...and I agree with most of the other posters regarding the same issues.Problem 1)I left the straps on the bag, they were ripped off, which yes left a huge rip in the side of the bagProblem 2)The carseat ONLY fits in ONE WAY AND ONE WAY ONLY, so if you can't figure it out using the 4 different positions, it can take a while, plus I think 2 people are needed to help hold it up, zip it, and clench it shutProblem 3)The zipper did break off, just kept unzipping so I had to break into the bag to get my carseat out. Thankfully it was when I was at home.My recommendation is...leave your carseat at home and get one from the firedepartment. They require a small deposit which you get back, and allow you not to lug your carseat around all over the place. Or get one from your rental agency, much less hassle than hauling this 20lb+ carseat around in its virtually useless ""carseat carry case""Other than using a Graco infant seat, this carseat won't ever see the underside of the plane belly..probably because I can't get the clips off the back of the carseat to begin with. And I dont even want to imagine what else will end up breaking or torn."
44442,1,I got this as a substitute for the crib rail since my son started swinging from the crib rail even though I had it set at the highest. SInce his is a convertible crib/toddler/day bed it made sense to get a guard rail and he absolutely loves it. I release it during the day so he has access to his bed even when it is not nap time so he can play with his toys. He uses the rail's frame to climb on the bed and overall I'm happy I got it.
174778,1,"My wife thought this would be useless - we can change the baby on the bed, etc... - and that the quality would be so bad that it wouldn't last. Well, she loves it now. Why? The pad is at the proper height when changing the baby on our chest of drawers and it is securely attached with the provided kit. We put the baby in there - he's a few weeks old - and tighten the belt so he is safe. Interestingly enough, as some others have mentioned, he loves the pad as a mattress and when he's being fussy, we put him in there and sleeps like a log, unlike in his bed. The pad is waterproof - I tried it! - and we found a nice cloth (arts and crafts shops) that we put on top. We haven't tried moving it in our bed, but that is something we might just do if the baby gets fussy at night. The raised 4 sides makes it very safe. We chose the 30"" because of the size of our furniture. We're big fans of this product now!"
160858,1,diaper dude is one of the best diaper bags ever!! i have it in the camo style and this bag holds everything!!..i recently purchased this one for my sister and she can't wait to use when her baby arrives ..christmas day!!! found it for such a great price on amazon too!!
122513,1,"Product arrived quickly and works as described. It was a bit of a pain to sit there and stick the small pieces everywhere. Then the stickers... Those were even worse.. I used tweezers and that made the stickers much easier to use.It comes with putty to stick the stars, honestly I did not think there was enough, so I used a hot glue gun.The glow does start to fade rather quickly but has a steady level it holds for about an hour. After that, they run out of light.Overall I recommend the product, they are pretty cool. It is something that is good for all audiences and no social pretense prevents these from being cool."
120710,1,"I don't use these for diapers, but I do use them for EVERYTHING else! My son has one at his side all day long!! He loves to snuggle into it!! Helps his fall asleep, they are soooo soft & cuddly, I want to sleep with them too!! They wash well also, they don't shrink, and I wash them 2-3 x's a week! Great for mopping up spills, spit up, drool. Wonderful product, highly recommended!"
163873,1,"I bought this pillow because I liked that it came in three parts with one big slipcover over the whole thing. After the first night of using it, I found that the center curved piece was too fluffy for me as a head pillow, but I easily took it out and just used my regular pillow instead. I tried using it with the slip cover on to hold the bolsters in place, but then I got tangled up in the part where the curved portion was supposed to be. So I just took the slipcover off completely (which was fine because it is a little scratchy in my opinion). The further along in my pregnancy that I've gotten, the more useful the pillow is. I'm able to cuddle up to one and use it to support my tummy and in between my legs and use the other bolster shoved tight behind my back (which has really helped my back pain). The curved portion was also great for massages. I used it to make a little nest for my belly so I could lie on my stomach and my husband could rub my back. Overall, I am very glad that I bought this pillow, even though I don't use it exactally like I thought I would. Just a word of caution: if you have a queen sized bed, with this pillow you are definately going to take up more than your half of it!"
19790,1,"My 6-month-old baby has been using these nipples since he was about 3 months old, and they are the only nipples he will take. They fit Playtex drop-ins or VentAire bottles. I breastfeed, and I've had no problem going between breast and bottle with these nipples. My baby much prefers the latex nipples over the silicon ones with the same shape.I gave this product 4 stars because of the eight nipples I purchased, one was faulty - very little liquid would come out."
165765,2,I would not recommend these diapers as they have a strong scent that irritate baby's skin even if not the sensitive type.
140820,1,"I breast and bottle fed my 10-month-old twin girls (8 months gestational) for their first 6 months, and now they are exclusively bottle fed formula. They used the slow and then medium flow nipples, but now they mostly use the Y-cut nipples because they can control the flow (and make it fast). The girls can be ravenously hungry in the mornings and the Y-cut allows them to feed quickly, but without ingesting tons of air.While the girls appreciate the speed at which they can consume their meal, I appreciate that the nipples don't drip a THING if there's no sucking action on them. So if the bottle happens to be tipped, NOTHING spills. In fact, I'm a little afraid to try my girls on the fast flow nipples because of the potential mess. The no-spillage bonus also comes in handy when one of the girls isn't at all interested in eating--she doesn't get a mouthful of formula which she can then spit (or raspberry) out all over the place.Downsides of the Y-cut compared with medium or fast flow:1) A baby needs to be reasonably hungry enough to make the effort to suck effectively. Sometimes one of my girls isn't super hungry (but still hungry enough to eat some if prompted--necessary when it's the last meal of the day), so I then use a medium flow with her so it's easy for her to drink even when she's tired (though if she's really not at all hungry, it can get messy).2) I've noticed that each leg (arm?) of the Y-cut's ""Y"" will lengthen over time, making the ""Y"" allow much more liquid through when sucked on. The damage could be caused by me flattening the tip when I'm pulling the nipple into the ring top--I'm not sure. Whatever the cause, once the cut is too big, when my girls suck on that nipple, they get way too much at once and end up spilling it out of their mouths. That's when I know the nipple needs to be tossed. So, the Y-cut nipple needs to be replaced more often than the medium or slow flows (we haven't tried fast flow yet).Note: We have never put cereal into a bottle, so have not tested this nipple's ability to handle cereal. When I first read the reviews complaining about it not working with cereal, I thought, ""How silly! You're not supposed to put cereal in a bottle!"" But then I noticed that it actually says on the packaging that it is for cereal! How unnecessary. It's way more useful NOT used with cereal."
101751,1,"This bag is terrific. It's very roomy and fits diapers/wipes/potty seat covers/placemats/hadwipes and more! I bought it for vacation and it held everything I needed and left my hands free! But when I wanted to take everything with me say into a restaurant, it pulls right off and has a handle for carrying. I am very happy with this purchase."
164290,1,"Exelente I love these diapers. They work well with my daughter. No leaks here! But I used to buy them on the Subscribe and Save program, and that's no longer available. Now the price at Amazon is just as high as anywhere else. I am upset that it's not a good deal anymore."
16933,1,"very strong, safe and easy to install, now i sleep with out worry , and in the morning is very easy to hide"
89263,0,"These diapers are ok. Comparing to swaddlers, these are just ok. The fit is not all that great and my baby gets red spots on her thighs, from the stretchy bands. And forget about the up to 12 hour protection at night cause after 4-6 hours she is all leaked through. I like that they are thin compared to other brands. but I would recomend the swaddlers."
184486,2,It doesn't really work well. Because it's velcro it tends to come apart under the seat when trying to adjust it...
179001,2,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this bottle before I wasted my money. These are terrible! I am definitely not saving them for my next child. The first few times we used them, my baby sucked on it forever and was getting almost nothing. We made all the nipple holes bigger, which helped some. However, while feeding we constantly have to loosen the top and bottom. I strongly DO NOT recommend these!"
81489,2,Just terrible. Would cut out every 10 to 15 seconds. Horrible static. Save money and get fisher price.
137391,1,This was a wonderful pillow. It is huge but that is the best part. It is also super fluffy. I think the case could be better.
16081,1,The color is pretty and the material for picnic or camping is just great. My family just enjoy it. The only drawback is the belt whcih can not be removed when in use.
86119,1,"It's a great election, good night shot, very good sound detection.I'm very happy with this product."
147504,0,"Our baby had to adjust to it... at first he didn't really like it. Now he can sleep in it, but we do have to rock him in it before he sleeps if he is not sleeping yet. His body does not naturally rock it back and forth (up and down). We are hoping that as he gets older (he is now just about 2 months) that he'll grow more used to it and rock it more. It is not a total waste though, he does sleep in it alot, mostly in the daytime. However, it's kind of bad because he gets so used to it he has a harder time sleeping in his bassinet. Hopefully the money that we paid will equal out if we keep using it. However, the bad thing is the playthings (those little teddy bears). We took them off and haven't put them on since, and now I can't figure out how to put it back on and have it stay. He did not like those teddy bears though."
153449,0,"I really like this stroller, but I feel like for [...] there's some features that really need improvement. Its got some great features - absolutely love the reverse handle. Love having baby face me. Couldn't be easier to switch her direction if the sun is too much on her. Love the colors and look. Weight is good. I've lifted it one handed out of my trunk. Opens one handed easily. Fits just fine in my car trunk (I have a nissan) and folded away in my hall closet. My baby seems to really enjoy the ride in it.Folding it up is very involved. Its a two hand fold. But you also have to first lower the seat, switch the hand back, adjust the wheels and THEN you can use to hands to collapse it.Steering is frustrating at times. I don't think it navitages well when turning around or making close turns. When the handle is in the reverse position, a slight incline or strong wind can make it start steering sideways. You have to kick the wheels back straight. I emailed the company to see if my wheelers are defective or this is a problem with the stroller in this position. Waiting to hear."
99453,0,I used to use pampers all the time and then switched a while ago. I thought I would go back and try them again and found that the size 5 diapers are smaller than other brands so I didn't even get through half the box before I had to order the next size up. Not sure why but now we are doing fine with size 6 but my daycare still uses 5 in other brands and they are fine on her...
92243,1,"This type of bottle I found very good from transfering from breast feeding to bottle feeding. I had received one for free after shopping at Motherhood Maturnity store and thought I would try it. My baby loved it and I instantly knew I needed to get more. She's been using them ever since and I've had no problem with them. No leaks and it works great to use them in a bottle warmer. I highly prefer these bottles to anyone, it's a great product!"
79833,1,"I love that the cushion is comfortable, easy to clean, and the color is wonderful, and my daughter loves to sit in it. Before we got the cushion she didn't like sitting in the chair at all now that's her favorite seat."
167510,1,"I have had great luck with this line of sippy cups. I love that they keep the milk cool so I don't have to constantly be keeping up with the cups. I haven't had major leakage problems, but I try and not run the rubber parts through the dishwasher. My favorite sippy's are munchkin snap and lock cups but since these keep the beverage cool these are the go to cups around my household."
43805,1,"I bought 2 of these to travel 3 weeks in Europe with my 2-year-old twins. They were the most utilized items since Europeans don't normally have high chairs for babies.The designer put a lot of thoughts into creating these booster seats. To inflate the seat, simply remove the plug from the cushion. To deflate, you sit on the cushion to ""squish"" all the air out. There are 2 sets of straps that tie to the back and bottom of the chair to keep the seat in place. A reviewer mentioned that her child ""wobbled"" in the seat. That just needs some manual adjustments to upright the seat and the child. The straps need to be tightened to keep the child and the sit in place.We were very pleased to have these seats with us. They were the last minute purchase and we couldn't be happier."
46161,2,"We really hoped to get a good stimulating mobile for our child, and this looked perfect. Upon un-packaging though, it became very clear that it was not a very well made toy. The cards are a flimsy plastic that has the tabs easily tear off. Two of the preset card pairs tore just straightening them into the T-shape. I am not willing to take a risk that the tabs may break off and become a choking hazard. IMHO it should cost about $10. We are disappointed and will be returning the mobile and looking for something that is better built."
99987,0,"I have used this from size2-3 for half a year. It has been pretty well for the baby until recently he reached 20 lbs. When he pooped, it seemed that the diaper can't hold it any more and we had to clean the clothes for a few times. we did not have a problem with our daughter who used 3 for a long time. But it seemed that this one is not a good match for baby boy. I am going to try size 4."
159146,0,"I used this seat with my baby for her first 10 weeks. During that time she loved it, kicking the pieces to start the music and watching the fish. However as soon as she got the ability to move just a little the seat became unsafe. The belt to keep the baby in is just too small to effectively prevent a child from falling. I would recommend looking for a seat with a more secure restraint system, I have seen them, but I don't know the brands."
140009,1,"I'd been looking for a low height gate that would contain our toy poodle, yet be of a height that would allow us to easily step over to pass from room to room. Not only does the gate function as required, it is rich looking and versatile. We leave the two overlapping pieces un-bolted so that we can easily pick up either side to use for blocking stairs or other door-ways. Since it stands on its own, it can easily be moved and does not mark the door jambs. Highly recommended."
171046,0,"This is a nice photo album for young toddlers, but the plastic sleeves are odd. It's hard to get the pictures into them and the photos stick them, so I'm not thrilled with this product. That being said, my 16 month old on can look through it, bend the pages, and basically cause little to no damage to the photos. He also cannot pull them out of the plastic sleeves, so I'm pleased with that part."
13320,1,When it comes to giving medicine this was a wonderful product. Mine came in one of my grooming sets and I used it religiously. For some odd reason my child would not spit out the medicine and I don't know if it was due to the size of it or what but it worked well for me. Glad to see it is now sold separately.
172693,0,"I was wooed by the shower gimmick and, as with almost every other poster, the shower component was initially very weak then broke within a few uses. At first I was going to return it but I decided to research other tubs and evaluate the tub portion separate from the shower. I realized that the tub component worked well for my child, he can sit up on his own so I use it without the sling and he loves to splash around in the water. Looking at other tubs the only comparable one seems to be the Eurobath, which costs the same. So, if you buy it for the tub portion alone it still seems like an ok buy. If you just think of the shower part as a free add-on that, if it doesn't work didn't cost you anything, than it's not a bad purchase but if you buy it expressly for the shower you will be disappointed. All in all the tub portion works well for me, my baby is happy in it so it is worth the money (twenty-five bucks)."
168162,1,We have been using swaddlers since his birth. We havent found any issues with it. The indicator has been a great help too. Larger the pack shorter trips to store and better it is.
16421,0,"I had to have these sheets to match my daughter's nursery.....they don't hold up in the wash and don't even try to put a mattress cover on the mattress with these sheets, as the sheets will rip in the corner. A better bet (and yes I wish someone would have told me) is the Gerber Knit sheets, they are not only a thousand times softer, but they actually fit with a mattress pad (and who wants to have only one thin layer of cotton between baby and mattress?) The Gerber sheets work much better, hold up longer and actually fit with a mattress pad. These Sea Life sheets are adorable and that is why I am not giving them one star but buyer beware.....they will rip in the corner, I felt like I was trying to wrestle with the crib every time I put one on."
165299,2,"I first tried these when my son was 4 weeks old. Pampers SWADDLERS are MUCH better. I bought a huge package of these and I wish I hadn't. First of all they always leak. My son will fill up one of these diapers in no time and he always leaks pee out the sides and up his back. Second, because they don't hold much liquid, his poops also spill out. They leak poop up his back and around his legs (and he does not have skinny legs. He was born 9 pounds.) The diapers aren't that soft either and they have caused my son to get diaper rash. I assume its due to the fact that they're not very absorbent and that they're not that soft. I absolutely hate these diapers. I usually like Pampers brand, but I have huggies and Luvs diapers that I like better than these. I plan to just send them to his daycare and let them deal with them and I'll use diapers I like better at home."
49109,0,"If you are using this type of play yard at your house as a permanent item to use for several months, the metal version is much more sturdy. We keep this plastic play yard at Grandma's house for our 17 month old twins, and it is okay as a temporary play yard. It has the advantage of being lighter than the metal one. You definitely need at least one extension panel set."
114503,1,"We ordered this as an emergency back-up once we realized that the wooden high chair we had was way too big for our son. This was the perfect choice - we didn't want a big high chair (we already have one, and just needed to bridge the time span until he can use it) and this little chair is ideal. It fits perfectly onto our kitchen chair, it's simple to clean, it's adjustable, and for being plastic isn't bad looking either. We definitely recommend this, on all counts - the perfect high chair!"
109740,2,The chart came all wrinkled because of the packaging and when I put it up it tore. Waste of money.
90877,0,this is our third child. We have been using Pampers diapers (same brand). These diapers are much lower quality compared to a few years ago.
162386,0,"the only thing i use in this is the nail clipers. i do like them alot though because they are easy to hold. i got everything else free from the hopital, so i guess the name hopital's choice does fit well. i would recomend you buy this after you have your baby it see if you really need it or not."
144956,0,"Looks great with the comforter set and my daughter loves it. The only problem (and a major one at that) is the motor only spins the mobile for a few short minutes. It would be nice if the music and mobile spun long enough for my daughter to fall asleep. Otherwise, she's only entertained as long as I stand there and keep winding it up."
130115,1,"We love this swing! Our little man crashes soooo nicely in this too. He takes his naps in it so well. I can't get him to nap in his crib for long, but it's okay. When he was real young and we would have some rough nights, we would bring the swing up to his room and he would sleep like a CHAMP-- one night when he was less then 2 months old he went like 6 hours straight in that... couldn't get that lucky with him in his crib!We really like being able to switch from a reclining seat to sitting upright and him being able to go side to side or front to back. It is also EASY to wash the covering of the seat. The lights and mobile are fun too!It is a great prodcut!"
74593,2,"The plastic is thin, flimsy and slides around on the table. Easy to get folds stuck in it. Picture scratches off very easily. Regret purchase."
98174,1,This was great easy to put together! Best Price I could find. I would recommend which I did was buy a thicker changing pad. I bought the summer infant contour pad and it was 13.00 and great!
20172,2,"We had all kinds of bottles in our house. We bought these to try and used it maybe 5 times total. Too many pieces, a pain to clean, and the nipple is SO SLOW FLOWING! This is not a ""middle of the night"" feeding friendly bottle .It took our son an additional 15 minutes to get this bottle down with the same amount of fluid in it as compared to the other bottles we had. We will NEVER use this bottle again. We threw them away!"
103550,2,"My 18 month old was able to unlatch the table and swing it. On one occasion she managed to pull it fully off. Also, since the height is not at all adjustable, she could not sit at the table.We returned it and found a better alternative."
154044,2,"While these may not have any added perfume or scent, the smell that results from the ingredients used is just terrible.The wipes are also smaller (coming from Earths Best) and I felt I was using double the amount on BMs compared to other brands I've tried.For the cost and lack of chemicals, I could have put up with all of the other cons listed if it weren't for the awful smell."
158364,2,"This product gives my daughter a rash every time she wears it so we stopped using it. She does NOT have sensitive skin, so this is not a common problem for us."
100848,1,I love Pampers Baby Dry. I've tried other brands but nothing compared. These are soft and hold up well for long periods of time (12 hours overnight). Highly reccomend!
157649,1,"I have a wood banister that spans my upper floor above the stairs. We attached this gate to the banister. The open end clips to the solid wall at the top of the stairs. We set the gate to open over the stairs so that if I wish to keep it open, I can tie the gate to the rail rather than having the gate create a blockade in the upstairs hallway. The only hazard to this is that if someone is coming up the stairs, they have to open the gate, then take a few steps back down the stairs in order to have room to get past the gate. Coming from the other direction is great, though. When my daughter grabs the gate rails and pulls herself up to standing, the gate is durable and stable. I feel comfortable knowing that she is safe near the stairs if I don't happen to be near her at the moment. I would recommend this gate again. (I got the black one and it looks great even though my railings/banister are wood and the walls are light cream)."
7373,1,This is my second one of these to buy for my son. It is his lovey and he sleeps with it. He loves the soft material and rubbing his fingers over the taggies while he is falling asleep.
88400,1,"These toilet seat covers are lined on the underside with a waterproof cover, and, they stick in place. So they don't slide off just as you are sitting down! :-)) I have a 4 year old granddaughter and we find the seat covers very useful for almost anywhere we go. When traveling, we use one of these seat covers on the hotel toilets...you know what they say about the way hotel rooms are cleaned."
122544,1,"The City Savvy is a great stroller for its category. It's lightweight, easy to maneuver, and fairly stylish. I routinely carry it and baby up two flights of stairs without difficulty. We've even been able to securely fit our Graco Snugride carseat front-facing into the stroller when baby was sleeping.However, there have been a few problems. The harness is hard to adjust with the child in it, and it doesn't adjust tightly enough for a small baby. The safety boot zipper broke the first time we used it. One of the brakes became stuck and rubbed on a wheel until we pushed it back in place. And after everyday use for a few weeks, the seat back began to slide down along the reclining mechanism cords. I plan to fix the latter problem by replacing the recline mechanism with a smaller diameter cord toggle. Despite all of these drawbacks, this stroller is still worth buying, if lightweight is on your priority feature list."
45511,1,"I got this one for my 2 weeks old boy, still didn't work well however it's 0-10 months, he didn't react at all. I tried it on another 6 month old boy, it was amazing, I can't wait for my boy to be 6 month."
95639,1,I could never get my 3 year old to pick up all of the stuffed animals in her room until we purchased this product. The hammock is a &#34;bed&#34; for her stuffed animals and she picks all of the animals up and puts them to bed. GREAT product.Good quality and includes mounting materials. Super easy to install.
18310,1,"We originally set this gym up for our son when we moved into our new house, and had nowhere to put him (he was 3 weeks old). As time went on, it just became convient to put him on the mat, close to us. It was really fun to watch him grow into all the toys! He started by just swinging his arms, and finally has learned to grab and interact with the toys! He loves the star in the middle. He could spend all day talking to that thing alone! He loves this gym so much that we take it everywhere we go. I highly suggest this gym for any baby! It is something that us or the baby couldn't live without!"
159551,1,My two month old really loves this bouncer. While I'm making dinner I sit her in the bouncer and she smiles and is so amazed. I don't know what I would do without it!!
42158,1,I love this hamper. It is so cute and perfect for my little boy's room.. The fact that the inside mesh bag lifts out means no bending to get all the clothes out or carrying the whole hamper to the laundry room. Great product!
13888,0,"After trying this product for one day, I realize that the baby definitely likes it more than the other ones. It's not much about the liners themselves but rather the shape of the nipple that came with the original box. Not having to wash the liners is great but I am going to stop using this because it's disposable. I would rather handwash the bottle than resorting to the convenience of the liners. Imagine all the plastic liners that you will have accumulated by the time your baby is 2!!! It's a waste."
7897,1,"This lotion is good for babies and works well for moisturizing. I read an article in the Boston Globe about how most name-brand baby products are actually filled with toxic chemicals including formaldehyde. I decided I wasn't going to expose my baby to these types of toxins, even if it was going to cost me a bit more. I checked the Environmental Working Group's skin deep website at [...] and was shocked to see that even products that advertise themselves as being wonderful and natural - like Aveeno - are filled with toxins that can alter hormone levels or lead to allergies.We'd been using Burt's Bees previously, and it isn't the worst, but this was much purer. I was sad to see that, because if you can't fully trust Burt's Bees to be super-good for you, what can you trust? I'll probably still use the Burt's on myself, but not on baby.Luckily, EMAB products really don't break the bank given how long they last, are pretty easy to find on Amazon (unlike many of the best options on the EWG site). I am a convert, and hope more people start using products like this and putting pressure on the big companies like Johnson and Johnson and Proctor and Gamble to shape up or ship out!"
21186,1,"I bought this for a friend's baby shower. I decided to place all my gifts in the medium size bin, it all fit wonderfully and the colors match her nursery decor. It looked beautiful along with the other gifts, and my friend has ordered more from this website for her daughter's nursery. The construction of this bin was well made, it took a few drops from me even before I brought it to the party. No tears to the cloth bin, the package it came in was sturdy, no shipping problems whatsoever. I highly recommend this product for a child's room or nursery. Beautiful!"
126864,1,"If I ever buy a different brand of diapers I regret it. Huggies are the ones I've had the least amount of blow-outs and leak-throughs with. Also,love getting diapers shipped to my door for just about the best price out there."
164306,1,We have tried a lot a different brands for our little girl. We had issues from rashes to UTI's from them. We tried these Pampers Baby Dry when she was just a couple months old and have been using them since. Great for wetness protection. We just recently upped the size to the 4 b/c our daughter is now 27 pounds.
130636,0,"over all a pretty well designed swing, but there is a reason its discontinued... not sure what that reason is, but i sent it back for this reason:IT ONLY RUNS ON BATTERIES...4 D'S...whose idea was that ???most other ones run on both, batteries and AC power...but not this onei loved the Aquarium design and could not find any other one that could compare, but we settled for Papasan version since its new design and does not need batteries..."
19252,0,"the support is a little bulky for the car seat. as my infant gets bigger, it is more difficult to get her comfortable in the seat. i feel she is cramped with the support."
100165,1,"We tried Huggies on our son and found that it caused him to break out in a rash. So, we switched back to Pampers and again have had no issues!"
8304,1,"I bought 3 of these sheets in Ecru and have been using them for almost a year. The color is what I expected and they are nice and soft. The best part is how easy it is to get these on the mattress. I really like how the sheet is constructed. There is a seam all along the sides of the mattress, so it really fits the mattress instead of having to stretch around to fit. I wish I had sheets like this for my bed!"
139753,2,"We received this chair as a gift and started using it when my son turned six months. He is now eight months and I am shopping for a better highchair. I didn't have any trouble putting it together and in the beginning it seemed fine. Now that my son is getting bigger and more mobile this chair is a safety hazard. He can turn completely around and possibly slip out the back. He has very chubby thighs, so I had to lower the seat to get him in and out easily but now he could slip backwards out of the chair. I can't take my eyes off him for a second while using this chair. Sometimes I stand him next to the chair and put the Cheerios on the seat for him to eat because that is safer than sitting him in the chair!The chair itself is falling apart after 2 months use. It's too low for our table and our baby sits with his nose at the edge of the table during meals. Since there is no tray food drips all over the chair and floor."
174738,2,"When I got this pump, I had been borrowing my sister's 7-year-old Medela Pump-in-Style. With her's, I would be able to get up to 11 oz in 30 minutes, and only got 3-4 oz in over an hour with this pump. I thought that maybe it was just because of the difference in the suction styles and that it would change, but after 10 or more days, there was still no change in the amount I was able to pump. I gave up and contacted Dr. Brown's about the issue. They told me that they would repair or replace the item, at my choice. They are sending me a brand new pump to return for my refund (minus a restocking fee from AJ Wholesale---boo!), and allowing me to keep the one I already have to regift to someone or to sell second-hand. I couldn't believe how great their customer service is! As for pumping, I have gone to the Medela Freestyle, which is worth every penny!"
163658,0,"With my first child I purchased a traditional high chair (Chicco brand). I didn't like how huge it was and how much space it took up in our small breakfast area. So with baby #2 I opted for the Space Saver in Mocha Butterfly. Baby #2 is now 8 months old and we use this high chair for most of our mealsPros:takes up less room than the traditional high chair (the footprint is only as large as your chair)can be pushed up to the table and used without the traycute designconverts to toddler seat (though we haven't used it this way yet)Fabric is washabletray fits in the dishwasherfabric pad clips into place and stays putConsfabric is NOT truly wipeable. With a messy self feeder I have to wash this pad daily and it requires line dryingunthreading and re-threading the straps through the holes is a pain (not impossible just annoying)chair pad is thin (and thus uncomfortable for baby) we have to use a folded towel to add extra paddingstraps are NOT easy to clean and are white (stain central)pad does not cover over the sides so food collects between cushion and chair every single timeholes/crevices/gaps on the inside of the armrests collect food and require a small head tooth brush to clean out (a washcloth can't get into the space well enough)armrests bump into the side of the table so we can't pull the seat in as close as we'd like (even when it's angled)The majority of my complaints would be solved with a change in the seat cushion. It if was plastic fabric, had more padding, and covered the chair over the sides it would be MUCH better. And if the armrests were removable....it'd be Perfect!!"
78143,1,"I did ALOT of research. I wanted something that reclined, 3 or 5 point harness, and easy to clean. I love that the seat is leatherette so clean up is a breeze. Not to many creases. The straps cn be a pain but not enough for me to tae anything off. It is kind of big but it does fold very flat (although I rarely fold it) it's light weight with wheels so easy to move. Get it."
18916,1,"I bought the Bundle Me Lite for the spring and fall months, but didn't really use it all that much. Unless you live in an area where the spring and fall months are cool for an extended period of time, I would just stick with the Original or Urban version. Here I guess the weather goes straight from Summer to Winter!I own the Original Bundle me and bought this new Urban bundle me for my cousin's baby. The Original Bundle Me seems to be warmer with the faux sheepskin on the inside instead of the micro-fleece on the inside of the Urban version. The faux sheepskin seems to be cozier for baby, too. When it is super cold outside, you have to add your own blankets inside any version of the BundleMe, but having the BundleMe definitely helps keep the blankets where you put them.One aspect of the Urban version that I liked better is that the nylon exterior of the Urban picks up less ""debris"" than the fleece exterior of the Original. The fleece seems to attract hair, dirt, etc. The nylon Urban is also rain/water resistant. The Original fleece one never seemed to get wet even though it doesn't make the claim that it is water resistant.The whole line of BundleMe products is an AMAZING god-send if you have ever had to put a baby into a coat or snowsuit and then tried to put the car seat straps around them. I can't tell you which one will suit your needs more, just trying to help make your selection process more successful!! Whichever one you choose will definitely make your life SOOO much easier!This is a link to the Bundle Me Original that I own:JJ Cole Original Bundleme Graphite"
51948,0,"I've had this for 6 months. It is fairly comfortable if it is adjusted perfectly, it is horrible if it is not. I find myself constantly making adjustments to it as baby gets bigger. My baby never fell asleep in it like he did the sling. I'm not sure I will use it anymore, now that I can use my sling in a hip carry position."
76426,1,"Have used this in the bassinet since we came home from the hospital 4 weeks ago and our baby seems to like it. We put a cloth diaper in the middle of it to catch any accidents. He does slide down sometimes but it doesn't make me nervous when he is between the wedges. We probably won't use it in the crib though. I definitely recommend this to parents with SIDS fears, reflux babies, or parents who just think their baby looks more comfortable."
110435,1,"As with everything about being a parent, locks are more complicated than you'd have thought (or would like!):SCREW-MOUNTED MAGNETIC LOCKS: The Safety 1st Tot-Lok Locks can be difficult to install, especially on drawers, but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure. Still, most people may want to try the adhesive locks (see below) first, to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly.Pros:+ Very nice & secure once installed, especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed.+ Works vertically or horizontally ... that is, on the side of a door or the top.+ Can easily be switched to hold the lock open, for when no children are aroundCons:- Complicated to install, especially in some situations. So you might not get around to installing them, given all the other demands on your time.- Requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part, plus some small holes to attach- May require some new tools - a collar lock, to keep from drilling through the door; and a right angle chuck for tight spacesIf you plan to be in your home for a while, and want a finished, secure set of locks, the Tot Loks may be a good choice.One note, if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs.ADHESIVE MOUNT MAGNETIC LOCKS: The KidCo Adhesive Mount Magnet Locks will only work in some spots, but it's still a good lock to try first, for a lot of people, because it works well (in the right situations) and is easy to install. Buy some and see how they work on your cabinets. Once you've tried a few, it's a lot easier to see where'll they'll work or won't work.Pros:+ Quick to install, after a few minutes of figuring it out+ No drilling required, so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetsCons:- Only installs horizontally (along the top edge of a door or drawer), given the way they use gravity to lock.We just use the adhesive mount, no additional screws, for some furniture we didn't want to drill holes into. They seem to be strong enough so far, especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while - if it won't open, they lose interest. I don't know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling.HOOK LOCKS: The advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type (like theMommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock) is that the hooks have a lot more play (they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock). So a child can bang them back and forth - they might not open the door or drawer, but they will make a racket. Maybe OK in some situations, but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors.SLIDE LOCKS: Slide locks (such as theAmerican Red Cross Cabinet Safety Slide Lock) are very quick and easy to install, if they fit. But they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock, so if they are within reach they aren't much of a barrier to older kids. And even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors. However, they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel.FLEX LOCKS: Flex locks (like the Safety First Cabinet Flex-Lock (see reviews) orCabinet Flex-Lock 2-Pack) are strong and easy to install, and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure (unlike the magnetic locks, which are designed to be out of sight). So you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink; or use them when you travel. And as a bonus, they are so secure that even some adults can't open them! ;-) (They do take two hands to open.) Not attractive, but they do the job if you keep them tightened."
69753,0,"This chair is big, and takes a lot of space. Dfficult to assemble. One of the tie down tabs that holds the seat cover down was damaged, so it does not keep the cover in place. The tray popped off with just a little pressure from the top. Glad my grand daughter was strapped in!"
122991,0,"These bottles and storage system are useful and fulfill the purpose of keeping everything straight and organized. However, 4 oz in these bottles is not the same as 4 oz. in my Dr. Brown bottles or even in my Ameda pumping bottles. I don't know if the marks on the bottles are just estimated numbers or what, but it gets frustrating when I think I have enough milk in the mother's milkmate bottle to make full eating bottle for my baby and then have to go and use some of the freshly pumped milk. FYI - they do fit perfectly on my Ameda Purely Yours pump."
145076,1,I love the jumperoo and I wish I bought this earlier. My son started using the jumperoo when he was 5 1/2 months old. He had great neck/ head support by 2 months. He would have love the jumperoo at 4 months or maybe earlier since he love to stand and tried to walk with support at 3 months. My son is 10 months now and he is outgrowing it but he still enjoys the toys on the jumperoo. Great toy and an amazing bargain.

28604,1,"I bought this glider and ottoman to match the furniture for my babies nursery. It looks great and was very easy to put together. The only problem I have is the seat cushion is not very comfortable. The cushion on the back of the glider is very comfortable and I am hoping with use that the seat cushion will soften up a bit. Other than that, I love it."
115682,1,"I bought this product because I needed a new stroller smaller and lighter than my PegPerego P3 stroller. This stroller was the solution. It is a great product, for an excellent price, is very nice, very light (even my wife agreed) and its design is very modern and cool, the color is excellent, and my baby sits very good in there.I recomend it 100%"
74097,2,"This is a great concept for an innovative stroller. I love that my [...] old can fit in the same stroller with out dragging out the double stroller. However, after using this stroller for 3 months, I returned it. There are several design flaws that were driving me crazy. First off, the front footrest was horrible. It has a flip-up design that does not allow my son's legs to rest on anything when it was in the down position. The footrest had to either be up at all times or my child's feet would flop over because there is no room for them. In addition, the front seat is very shallow and my son needed to be belted at all times or he would slide right out. Also, the tray is very difficult to remove and the stroller didn't break-down with ease (it was stuck opened several occasions). So, therefore I returned it and found another brand (same style) with out any of the flaws."
89185,2,"These diapers are great for pee (never leaks), but terrible for poop (frequently leaks). We've been using these for the past 2 months (my daughter is now 4 .5 months, average size). She is breastfed so her poop is really runny. Even if I literally run to change her as soon as I hear her poop, it still regularly squeezes up and out all over her back and clothes. Most days she messes her clothes at least once. I'm going to try something else because this is just ridiculous (and gross!)."
125002,2,"The good thing is that, except for the spring, the jumper is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the spring is THE most important part and it is not good. It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it. We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl."
126269,1,I cannot find these diapers for this good price at any other place.
13609,2,This dressing table is advertised for babies age 0-3 years. The shelves are made of a thin composite rather than wood. When you open the box and read the directions for assembly you will find in large letters &quot;Maximum Weight 20 lbs&quot;. This weight restriction means that most one year olds will be too heavy for the table. I suggest buying something stronger that you can use for a longer time.
177694,1,"When I was exploring the world of breast pumps by reading every review I could find and talking to anyone who has pumped within the last 3 years I came to the conclusion that the Isis Back-To-Work pump was the one for me. I am an active person who likes to camp, hike and mountain bike so I am not always in a position to find an electric outlet. I am also someone who will not use an item that is uncomfortable or inconvenient. The Isis Back-To-Work set comes with everything you need to pump away from home and get your baby's precious food supply back home safe and unspoiled. I also find the pump to be painless and easy to use. For me this was a wise purchase."
2702,0,"Based on the other review, I was very excited to try this product despite the cost. (Our diaper champ has been in use for two years now and we have to light candles to mask the odor of some diapers.) The spray has a pleasant odor, but it's power just doesn't last - and you have to use quite a lot of sprays on the offending diaper."
136383,1,"This exersaucer is the best that I have found so far. Not only does it keep my baby entertained it also has features that doubles as a car toy and when they get older the attachments can be used as everyday toys. The price is a little much but for the quality of the merchandise, it is a""BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!!"""
15455,1,"This bouncer is just what I was looking for. I wanted a bouncer that I could easily carry from one room to the other, which is possible thanks to convenient handles, it is very confortable, the back seat and the foot rest are reclining. On top of that the material used is very perspirant, the baby is nerver wet despite hot weather. Very easy to clean, the seat unscracth and goes into the washing machine. It is also a very light item.The only negative thing I would mention is the system that allows you to recline the seat, it seems to me a bit fragile, but up to now I haven't had any issues with it anayway.Very good product."
103545,2,"I bought this seat for my 11 month old son and I am taking it back before I even put him in it. While trying to put it together the back and seat of the chair fell out several times despite having them secured in the slots provided. I can only imagine how it would hold up with my 21 lb. son in it, let alone the 50 lb. weight limit that it claims. Also because of where the chair straps are positioned, it did not attatch securely to our kitchen chair because only the lower part of the seat was attatched to the chair and the top was allowed to move. My husband and I both tried securing the straps at tight as we could get them and there was still enough give that the seat could be wiggled off the side of the chair."
153833,1,If I use any other wipe on my daughter she gets a really red behind and/or rash. These wipes are the best for sensitive skin!
136512,1,"As with most DIY furniture, having an electric screwdriver, a rubber mallet and a hammer handy makes the assembly process a lot easier. However, it still took most of the afternoon for one person to complete. Quality is good overall, but the rear support boards (which you can't see anyway) were challenging to attach b/c they weren't cut evenly and the door hangs just slightly askew. However, it looks nice and has crisp, clean lines. Arrived undamaged with all the hardware."
159152,2,"I registered for this when I had my son. The metal base broke at the bend from the floor base. I returned it and exchanged it for a new one. 2 years later i had a daughter, put together the replacemnt. she is about 6 mths old, 12 lbs and the replacement broke in the same spot?! and just from my daughter rocking it herself, kicking her feet. Be careful."
37431,1,"My son spits up quite a bit so I use this after feedings to gently remove any milk residue from his mouth and especially his neck area where, if left too long, things can get stinky. This is also great after changing poopy diapers. A couple swipes of this on a cotton round removes remaining residue that you didn't even know was left on your baby. It leaves your baby clean, fresh, and yummy smelling in between baths."
169471,1,"My wife bought me this bag and I love it. It's great that it doesn't look like most diaper bags. The camo pattern is great. The zippers are strong and well assembled. There is plenty of room for everything you need, but it's not so big that it feels cumbersome. I highly recommend this bag."
174879,2,"This product is NOT organic! Why? Because it is NOT made of 100% organic materials! This company appraently wanted to jump on the $$$ ORGANIC BANDWAGON $$$ but didn't particularly care whether their product adhered to organic labeling standards.Note to organic consumers: always read the product description and, when in doubt, ask questions!

In the case of this mattress pad, I have to assume the latter, since they labeled their product as ""Organic Cotton Waterproof Crib Mattress Pad,"" when it is clearly not! Yes, the cotton may be 100% organic, but the mattress pad, as a whole is not, as there's no such thing as an organic petro-chemical polyurethane membrane.There are many in the organic bedding industry who would call this mattress pad toxic!This type of misleading product description really irriates me. Particularly so, when the product is being peddled for babies. The issue of toxic vs. non-toxic bedding for children is a serious one, and I think this company should be driven out of town on a rail for trying to pull this polyurethane membrane over the eyes of new parents, who simply endeavor to buy organic (non-toxic) bedding for their baby.For a true 100% organic mattress pad, you'll have to pay double or triple the cost of this pad. It will be made of organic cotton fabric AND organic cotton batting, with zero non-organic components. For an organic waterproof pad, the only choice is one made with organic wool. There are many reputable companies on the internet that offer genuinely organic bedding products for babies and children. The Priva Snoozy people are not among them."
91944,2,"well, I tried and thought it was too big. It does not get soft and the bigger end stays too tough so I found it quiet uncomfortable. I am actually returning it. I am at the beginning of my 6th and I weigh 119 pounds. Maybe I am just not heavy enough ?? but still."
159651,1,"I didn't have this bouncer in the first few weeks, but once I purchased it, I don't know what I did without it! It is so nice to be able to put the baby down in something and have your hands free. Whenever baby is fussy and doesn't necessarily want to be held, I can put him in this, and he calms right down. I don't always use the entertainment bar, but when I do, he loves it! He likes to watch the bubbles and listen to the music/waves/etc. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that sometime the bubbles will stop working and I have to smack the bar to get it going again. Other than that, I have not had any problems with it. We have had several diaper blow-outs and spit-ups on this, but the material washes up like a dream--does not shrink at all. I would recommend this to any parent!"
156545,2,We bought this swing to soothe our daughter when she got her first ear infection at 5 months. We wish we had kept the box and the receipt b/c she doesn't much care for it. There's not a lot of support and it's barely strong enough to swing her and she's only 17lbs. She now sticks her leg out to stop the swing while it's in motion which is very dangerous. I wouldn't recommend this swing. It's sitting in her nursery collecting dust.
99843,1,"All we use on our children is Pampers. Yes they may cost a little more, but you save money because you don't have to change diapers as often. I would rather spend a little more & know that even though my son or daughter has a wet diaper, they are not going to get a rash if I wait 2 minutes to change them. Peace of mind is priceless, especially when it comes to my kids."
20532,1,"My grandchild adores this jumper! It was worth every penny. After a little while in this, she sleeps like a lamb!"
87745,1,"I was worried about spending the money on this play mat, but I definitely don't regret it! My son was about 3 weeks when I got this, and he enjoyed looking at the toys and black and white shapes the first time he laid on it. Now he's 9 weeks and he loves to swat at the toys dangling above him. I also attached some of his favorite toys, which gives him even more things to occupy himself with. The arches also come in handy as a sort of barrier when the dogs are running around him. I would recommend this to anyone!"
79908,1,"Keeps the bottle cold-ish for about two hours. Good for short trips, you don't have to worry about ice packs. Nice and slim."
127539,1,"We bought this crib for our 5 month old son. Up until this point he had been sleeping in a pack 'n play in our room d/t lack of space in our apartment. Now we live in a house so he has his own room and needed a crib. The crib is beautiful...we chose the espresso finish. I was a little nervous to purchase a crib made of pine because of all of the reviews saying it scratched so easily but there are very few hard wood cribs out there...unless you want to pay an arm & a leg for one, which we didn't:). Anyway, my husband & I are both tall...6' & 6' 2"" so we don't have the issue that some mentioned about scratching the side rail with a belt buckle or anything. I plan to look into getting some fleece covers for the rails when the little guy starts to get teeth so that we can try to keep the wood in good shape."
172884,1,Just what I thought they'd be like. Arrived early. Couldn't find these individually sold anywhere. They work great with the kanteens!
53113,1,"This is a great bank and my daughter (4 yrs) loved that she could put her name on it. Only two complaints: the slots on the top of the bank that you drop money into are a little big (probably so you can fit in folded dollar bills), but so much so that coins can fall out if the bank is tipped over. The second complaint is that the marker does not work to write on the space provided on the top of the columns (save/give/spend)."
160068,1,Our 10 week old daughter had not slept for three days. We had called the doctor and searched on the internet for suggestions to get her to sleep and keep us from going insane. I read a suggestion that colicky babies liked to be swaddled and remembered that we had a Swaddleme in the closet. It was so easy to put her in and she has slept well for the past three nights. I am so thankful for this product!!!
101832,1,Dont know what we would have done without this. Small enough you can get it through the doors. Big enough baby can entertain herself for long periods of time. Super cute pattern. Bassinet feature was great when visiting friends when baby was small.
172256,1,"I have no problem giving my son a bath using this tub seat. I've been using it since he was 7 months old. It keeps him from slipping under the water. Just be sure that your baby can sit up on his own. Otherwise, you'll need one hand to prop the baby up and your other hand to wash the baby. Overall, I would say this is a good find!"
77767,1,"I purchased this sheepskin pelt for my newborn grandaughter and she loves it. Excellent quality, beautiful and of course very comfy."
176247,1,Make great burp cloths. They are thick &amp; absorbant.
46405,2,"If you are strong, and don't mind using muscle when trying to pry open one of the panels of this thing, the safe play yard does its job. However, like too many safety products that are made without much thought to who will actually be using them (i.e., mothers who are often sleep deprived...bless their souls), this product has a seriuos design flaw: it has no lock/unlock mechanism. What you need is brute strenght to pry the panel up and out, and when the baby is safely in the yard, you need to, again, lift and pry it back into place. Not the most user friendly design I've seen. Summer Infant has another product that does have a door, which we subsequently purchased."
61033,0,"It's not that the diaper genie is bad. It does what it says it will--control odor in your baby's room. However, after using it for a little over 4 months, we have found that it is a pain in several ways: 1. It is EXPENSIVE to buy the refills. If we did it again, we would get a diaper disposal system that uses regular trash bags or the plastic grocery bags. 2. The refills are difficult to change. We've even had trouble with a piece on the top that turns the bag to twist it, breaking. It's really easy to break something or not put the pieces back in the right way. 3. It fills up pretty fast. And you almost never have time to unload it when this happens. We started off loving this contraption and singing the praises that you've heard from so many, but have since found ourselves grumbling about it more and more. We'll probably stick with it for a while because we've got it, but if you are considering buying a diaper disposal system, I'd probably go for another one."
113026,1,My son loves his growth chart and looking at the pictures of himself. I really like that this is a plastic chart so it can be transported and preserved really easily. It also has lots of extra footballs in case you make a mistake. Cute.
17506,0,"We purchased this chair when my daughter was five months old. She seems quite comfortable in it, however we have 3 major problems with it:1.) The tray is much to high for her to be able to eat off of it. (It's in the closet for now until she grows).2.) The five point harness is way to big for her and it literally hangs off of her and she ends up grabbing the straps and biting and sucking on them like a teether (Gross and really unsafe). The harness's lack of support causes a slouching issue as well.3.) Finally, the cleaning issue is a hassle as others have written. I haven't had it long enough for it to clump up, but I can tell already that it will be a challenge to keep clean.Overall, I think my daughter is more comfortable in this chair than other models, but I'm not sure that I would have bought it had I known all of the practicality drawbacks."
53707,1,"I don't understand all of the reviews concerning the table lip! The chair has two folding mechanisms for this exact reason. While it hasn't fit on EVERY table that I've tried (one being at a Texas BBQ restaurant with bigger than life tables that looked like tree trunks), it has fit on a good 90% of tables at restaurants we've visited. And we eat out a lot. I can schlep the kiddo to a cafe and hook him up to the bar with no problem. He's not in the way, and doesn't cramp my style :PThough I guess I could say this about any portable high chair, this product is a lifesaver at weddings and events that normally don't cater to babies. It allows for the baby to be included at the table, and when eating out, allows us to keep baby inside of a booth seat instead of at the end where the waiters serve your food.When I first purchased this, my son was sitting a little low. This was EASILY remedied by having him sit on a small pillow tucked in the chair. After that, he was a happy camper. He is now big enough to use this chair with no pillow.The reason for only 4 stars is because of the bit of trouble I have actually folding it back. I found the silver collapse buttons on the frame to be very small, and it hurt my thumbs to push in. Since the chair is not so big, I've opted to just never fold it in. I simply slide it in the back of my car completely assembled. No biggie. I've carried purses bigger than this chair.Maybe I just don't know any better. This is the only hook-on chair that I have had the pleasure of knowing. But it seems to do the trick, and we continue to use it graciously. I would buy one again."
104824,1,"I purchased the Radian 80 Supercool for my 7 mth son, he quickly outgrew his infant carseat being 6mths and 21 lbs. I did alot of research an came down to the britax, combi turnaround and radian 80. After realizing the combi turnaround only went to 22lbs rear facing I purchased the Britax at babiesrus thinking it would be easier then having to order radian online. Big mistake that carseat is so big an clunky it took up most of my back seat and i have a jeep and when i thought about how much traveling we do i couldnt imagine lugging around that big ol thing. I quickly ordered the radian 80 this carseat is great, really slender and great for traveling i also purchased the carry bag which allowed me to strap it on like a backpack at the airport, Love this carseat couldnt say enough good things."
42453,1,"This carrier is so comfortable. Reminds me of being pregnant when i use it and my two month old enjoys it. Unfortunately, i can only use this during cooler weather otherwise me and the baby will be sweating. Also, i tend to put the wrap on at home when i'm going out to do errands. It's much easier than putting it on in the car or parking lot."
102725,1,"If you will ever be traveling without your spouse, you need this! It makes life easier! For the price, it is cheaper than getting an extra seat where you travel the most, such as the grandparents. It allows us to travel anywhere and we will always have our seat that we picked out based on safety, etc. Plus it keeps the little one contained in the airport! I gate check it all and of course am last to exit the plane, but that is what most do with kiddos anyways! I was worried about the plastic strap, but it has held strong for many trips so far.TSA Rant.The only annoying thing is that TSA doesn't understand these are 2 seperate pieces attached by a strap. They just throw our stuff around bc I'm trying to hold a toddler. ANNOYS me SOOOOO much that they don't treat our stuff with more respect. I had to reconnect it a few times after going through security but had no one to hold my toddler...the TSA woman said it was against policy....I gave them a piece of my mind at that point. So, remind TSA to be gentle with it! Also, file complaints about TSA and airports that are not family friendly. It is ridiculous!"
29710,0,I love everything about this bag except the moldy smell that comes from the changing pad. Anyone else experience this? I exchanged the first bag that was given to me at my baby shower after I opened the closet and the closet had taken on the mold smell. I tried airing it out. Replacement bag also had the same smell. I exchanged the bag last night for a different brand and noticed the other Eddie Bauer Diaper bags on the shelf had the same smell. Could be my pregnancy has made me too sensitive to the smell.
7153,1,Pampers diapers are very good. Both my son and daughter use this product and we love them. Good absorbance. We never had diaper rash problem. The diapers are high in the waist line and therefore don't cause leakings especially for boys. And cruisers are good for active toddlers. I always buy from Amazon no matter it's a couple of dollars more or less than in the store--it's delivered fast to your door (I sometimes order when I only have one day's supply left and the next day I got it). I give it 5 stars for both the product and the experience of shopping with amazon.com.
45976,0,I bought this for my twin boys who are now 6 months. They love to look at it and grab it (when I dangle it by hand). I like the pictures and the fact i can alternate the pictures. The only downfall is that it doesnt spin. I wish it would spin that way it would keep them entertained longer. They would stare at it and lose interest until i spin it and they would look again. I wish i would of invested into a different mobile that spins on its own.
138952,1,I thought that it wouldn't work as well as it does. I was pleasantly surprised! My son loves turning it on at night!
161210,2,"I hate this tub. Flat out- I hate it!!! My daughter loved to kick and splash in bath time and she constantly kicked the blue bar, which had to hurt! It isn't very deep, so she froze. Ours leaked slowly, so Daddy invented ""speed bathing."" Not very much fun. By the time she was done, there was barely any water left. And once she was about 3 months old (and she was not a big baby!) we had to retire it because it was simply not a comfortable fit.We bought the Primo Eurobath, which was so much better. The sling on this bath tub was nice, that is the only star it gets. Other than that, forget it, it isn't worth it!"
117731,2,"This is a fun jumper, but it is too long. Even when I adjusted it to the shortest level possible, my daughter's legs were too low. It's like she's almost sitting on the ground. Our doors are standard, and my daughter is under 20lbs. so I don't know why it hangs so low. It would be a lot more fun for her if she sat up higher and was able to jump with the tips of her toes."
180180,1,"I have had five breast pumps both electric and manual. Some have been given to me as baby shower gifts, but most don't seem to satisfy my need. I decided to buy a Medela Harmony, and now rarely use the others I own. It's just perfect -- gentle, quiet, and fast at expressing milk. Earlier I was so concerned that I would never ever have enough milk supply for my baby. But now with Medela Harmony the supply is abundant!"
109742,2,"The design is thoughtless - if you want to put it on the wall to accurately measure height, you have to cut off the bottom ""Zone"" portion."
127409,1,"Although our baby haven't arrive yet, her crib is all set up and waiting for her arrival. We wanted a sleigh style crib so that we can use the headboards for her bed as she gets older. After reading tons of reviews from different makers, we settled on the DeVinci Kalani Convertible Crib. Although the main reason was because it was cheaper ($250) than the other brands, it also looked nicer than the other brands. I like the fact that it converts to a full size bed vs. twin size as with some of the other brands. Assembling it is not difficult at all. I did it myself in about 1 hour (it helps to lay all the parts out and then follow the instructions). The assembled crib is very sturdy. We got the MDB twilight mattress for our crib which fits perfectly. Overall we are very happy with this crib. As for the form and function of the crib, we'll have to wait for our little one to arrive. To be continue....."
73133,1,"I have a one year old and the Floppy seat goes everywhere with us . To the grocery store , out to resturants and even to Home Depot with my husband . Our daughter loves the softness of the Floppy seat and loves to relax while we shop. I would highly recommed the Floppy seat to anyone who is thinking about buying it . Also just think those grocery carts and high chairs in resturants are filled with germs . Kara , Syracuse, NY"
127608,1,"I received the cherry cradle today and am very pleased! It was purchased off of my registry and arrived quickly. I assembled it in less than a half an hour and found it to be very easy. It didn't scratch during assembly and the instructions were very straight forward. I also have a DaVinci Crib in the same color and they are a perfect match. I am looking forward to using it with our son when he is born. The only downfall is the pad that comes with it. The people who purchased the cradle didn't realize that it came with a pad and bought a seperate one and I am glad. I wouldn't have used the pad that came with it, it's way too thin and flimsy. Other than that, very happy with the product."
85773,2,The safer grip did not meet out expectations and it was returned. It became loose so one could never be certain that it was safe to grab. We eventually installed safety bars in our shower that were attached by screws to the studs behind the tiles.
146760,1,"Overall this is a really cute scrapbook to use as your child's baby book, however the manufacturer really should reevaluate it's quality control measures.I ordered a second copy of this item because the first one I received had some major flaws. The ribbon near the bottom of the cover in both books I received was folded over & was stitched down crooked (one book was far less severe than the other). The metal plate that holds the book title was also mounted crooked. Also, the pink color was extremely different on both books (one was cotton candy pink, the other was baby pink). I decided to keep the one that was just a little screwed up because I like the concept so much, but I will be replacing the ribbon & attempting to re-mount the metal plate.I guess I just wish that this manufacturer realized that people use their books to hold their child's most precious memories, and they expect everything to look perfect. Disappointing, but not a deal breaker in my case!"
109840,1,"I am aware this bed rail is more for a child but I bought this bed rail for my husband who has Alzheimers and is extremely frail and only 87 pounds. It is made well and my husband can't hurt himself on it because it is made up of fabric and mesh. For his size , it gives him the protection he needs to prevent him from moving/sliding off the bed and I can sleep better because I am more relaxed knowing my husband is safer."
77863,2,"I was excited to try these because I liked the idea of getting my son something that let him put his legs together. I am tired of seeing him so bowlegged due to the diapers. And since I like the other Huggies styles, I was very enthused. Until I went through 5 diapers, everyone of which leaked. Leaking of urine was the biggest problem but after a BM came out the legs, I gave up. I tried everything possible to make these work, but they leak. Maybe in the smaller sizes, but size 5 on a 22 month old definitely did NOT work. Also, my son is in 50% percentile for height and weight, so skinny legs were not the problem.No more Natural Fit/HugFlex for us!"
44125,1,"I bought this because the tub spout is corroded and it makes the water go backwards, dripping on the tub lever. The water now goes forward, by putting it on a slight angle."
83498,1,"I bought this for the bigger size and because it is hard to find. I had one of this size from a friend and the only difference between that one and this one is the backing - this one is more flannel like only both sides whereas the one from my friend is a little more ""slick""."
90100,2,"These diapers are terrible. I have been using the Pampers Cruisers and those work well. I thought I would try the Baby Dry for overnight. Every night my baby wets right through these. I have to change his entire outfit during the night, which really wakes him up and makes it difficult for him to go back to sleep. Sometimes I have to change him twice. I will not be buying these again."
88315,0,"I love the color, but just like the bag. I thought it would be bigger. It holds my stuff, but doesn't open very wide. And it only holds the bare minimum... not much room for toys or more than 2 bottles... it's not an ALL day or overnight bag. But it does the job I suppose. If you only need to take the bare minimum then it's fine otherwise go for something bigger!"
159239,2,"We have not had ANY luck with Fisher-Price products. When this P.O.S. worked for about 6 short weeks though, it was a good product. Ours broke without warning, and now the aquarium part does not work at all. We get music, sound effects, and the blinking lights, but no bubbles and fish/starfish movement. It really sucks to see (and hear) the dissapointment on our baby's face as the aquarium suddenly stopped working! Also, our other bouncer, a Fisher-Price 'Flutter & Chime' bouncer, has this plastic bird that vibrates excessively and makes a loud, annoying noise. It is not affixed properly to the product to begin with. We also were dissapointed in the Fisher-Price 'Aquarium Cradle Swing', since the swing goes much too fast, even on the slowest setting. All in all, 3 different products by Fisher-Price, and all fell short in expectations and useability. Bottom line- look elsewhere for a better quality bouncer. Clearly, Fisher-Price quality is not too good on many of their seemingly shoddy products.UPDATE: 1/2/2006 After taking this thing apart, and fixing the loose connections inside, I have been using this the past few weeks, and yesterday, my 13 pound, 4.5 month old daughter managed to thrust her head over the side of this bouncer, and she hit the floor! Despite tightening the straps to the correct length! Folks, even if you are there supervising your infant, they can thrust themselves off the sides and get hurt. All it takes is a second. This is a FLAWED and DANGEROUS product! There should be some sort of side-guards or higher side bolsters in order to keep infants from falling off the side. I was lucky in this case, since my infant apparently did not get hurt. I am throwing this product out immediately, and destroying it so nobody else gets their hands on it. It's that potentially dangerous! Just read every other review here. So many others have mentioned the same shortcoming. This product should be taken off the market immediately!"
176318,1,"What a great product!!!! I discovered this breastpump 8 years ago with my son. I used it regularly, with ease. I used it again for my 5 year-old daughter. This was my primary method of pumping after returning to work full-time. I considered the Pump-in-Style, but knew I'd be pumping in my car due to lack of privacy (I travel for work and have no predetermined place to pump). I'm preparing to return to work again--my third child is now 5 months old. My pump works as it did new 8 years ago. I further want to mention that two of my friends have also ""borrowed"" my pump with their children. To date, this pump has been used for 6 babies. I think I've gotten my money's worth!!! I have opted to use mine with batteries. The pump does go through batteries quickly. I've just learned to always have spare batteries with me."
80324,1,I got this mattress to go with the Delta Riley mini-crib and it fits perfectly...it is a little higher than what i expected but at least I can adjust the level of the crib railing to adjust to it but my son sleeps so soundly at night now.
61534,1,"At first glance this product looks very cheap - very light plastic. But after using it for several months now I'm impressed by the clarity of sound I get with this little thing. I can hear every little rustle my baby makes, clearer than if she were right next to me.The only problem we had was when there was line-of-sight between the receiver and transmitter (from the bedroom down the hall to the living room) we would get static feedback whenever the bedroom door was opened - probably because of house sensitive this thing is. Once we moved the receiver we no longer have any problem at all."
150302,1,Great product for the price. The fabric is incredibly soft. Washing is easy and it fit the contoured changing pad nicely. Just wish it was made in the USA.
17206,2,"This Monitor is our 2nd picture Monitor. Compared to our previous (broken) monitor, the picture itself is perfectly clear during the night & day. However the static is constant no matter what room we move the monitor to. As long as the volume is on the lowest setting, it reduces the static tremendously. Then we can just barely hear baby, sometimes not at all. We must rely on the flashing red lights to tell whether or not our baby is crying. This monitor would be better for a playroom instead of a baby room."
125715,1,"This is a great baby book! Goes beyond expectation!! Bought my granddaughter, & sister-in-law each this book!! Wonderful, & again, very fast delivery!!"
170948,1,"Excellent product, although the range isn't what it's claimed. We live in a 2-story concrete house. Reception fades if the distance from the base exceed over 20 feet. However, there is in interference whatsoever. I highly recommend it if you're in an apartment."
126338,1,These diapers are a great deal when you sign up for subscribe and save and sign up for amazon mom! Cheaper than any store. Love me a good deal!
175784,2,This border did not go on well and did not stick once we got it up. We have used York borders in the past and they work much better!!!
109819,1,Well worth the money! I love the feature that toggles the guard rail to the opposite side of the bed so that it can't be pulled or pushed off the bed. This product exceeded my expectations. I'm very pleased.
120048,1,"Our baby had some problems with gas when she was very small, even though she was nursing. When she took a bottle, we started using these and we did notice a difference. I can imagine that they're not quite as convenient when mixing formula, since it says all over the instructions not to shake liquid in the bottles."
103616,1,"I have been very happy with this product. I use it with a Medela In Style Pump and it seems to work more efficiently, getting (more?) milk out much faster than the standard breastshields. As for the complaints from those who have experienced pain, there is a simple solution - just use lanolin. Having read these complaints before my first use I used lanolin from the get go and never had any problems. I tried one time to skip it and ouch, I figured out really fast what people were complaining about. But when I put on a little ointment before pumping there is no discomfort at all. I wish I would have given these a shot months ago..."
7088,2,"Who designed the shape of Pamper diapers? I feel it is the worst shape for a diaper. Its tab is far blow waist position , which induces my son leaking poos from back and leaking pees from sides. To avoid leaking, I have to tightly package him, which induce red inprint on his legs. I bought Huggies diapers and Especially for Baby diapers for my son. He seems comfortable in them. Most important, no leaking happens any more! My son weight only 15 lbs."
184172,1,This has saved me so much frustration from having to put stuff ontop of my strollers and from having to use one hand to stand up a stroller while I load stuff in my trunk with teh other hand
19076,1,"Love this print! This print is like a moss green, but it's not too bright. It's fun, refreshing with the touch of flowers. my son loves to sit on my hip and this sling is perfect for that purpose.I can pop him in and out very quickly. This is one of three I own. I love them all depending on what my mood is or what I'm wearing."
139539,1,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she opened it early. She loves it!! Its a great product but the amber color doesn't show well.
95557,1,"It doesn't look very big at first, but it holds a lot of stuffed animals! This is a great product!"
179634,0,"The concept is a good idea but in reality there are faults to this product. It attaches to the car seat and stays attached as long as you are rolling the product, as soon as you lift it to place it in a car, or up stairs, it comes off the wheels. It needs additional attachments to hold the carseat onto the travelmate. As many travels know the airport only want quick, they don't like waiting for you to reattach your wheels to the carseat after it goes through security. Fellow travelers don't want to wait while you reattach the carset to the wheels after it comes off the transport bus. So I would not buy this again unless they fix these faults."
124548,1,"This toy was recommended to me by a few children I used to nanny for and their mother...who also happens to be a pediatrician. My son, who is now 6 months, LOVES them! We stack them up and then he cautiously - and sometimes brutally - knocks them down with such delight. He also likes to practice holding them like ""big people"" cups, knocks them together as a musical instrument, and enjoys playing with them in the bath - all great for practicing his motor skills. They are colorful and durable, simple and classic. They also have numbers on them, so as he grows we can talk about the numbers and colors. What fun! A perfect little gift for little ones - and small enough when all stacked together to fit easily inside a diaper bag for travel. LOVE these!"
34089,0,"So this was a GREAT idea, until I had to take it through security. It doesn't fit in the xray machine, so I had to remove the seat from the bag, while holding my one year old and all of our stuff. NOT easy. It's also a HUGE pain in the butt to get down the aisle of the airplane. If you are planning to fly with your carseat? Don't use it. The padding is great for keeping the carseat safe when checking bags, but TERRIBLE for allowing it to fit in tight spaces."
56377,1,"These don't leak, are easy to clean, and the perfect size for meals. I had the bigger gerber sippies but my Dr thinks my kids are drinking too much and gaining weight. perfect portion control."
14353,2,"No matter what the reasons are, it leaks! and it is very frustrating."
152342,1,"We have a very modern home, and all the other solutions out there for stuffed animal containment just didn't jive with our decor. When we came across this for our 3yr old's room, we knew it was perfect. He LOVES it and we do too. Excellent idea, and very good quality. Just be warned, your child will probably want to dive off their bed onto it once it's full."
48917,1,"We purchased this item for our 10 month old as she had been attempting to climb out of her playpen. We really like the size of the pen and most importantly, our daughter seems really happy in it. She is able to 'push' it a little, but not enough for us to be concerned with."
88840,1,"I love these diapers. They fit my son perfectly and we rarely have accidents leak through. I especially love ""subscribe and save"" which is a much cheaper, way more convenient way to get diapers. Would recommend the diapers and the ""subscribe and save"" program to anyone!"
4555,1,"ITEM CAME JUST AS PICTURED, FAST SHIPPING AND GREAT QUALITY! LOOKS GREAT ON MY DAUGHTER'S DOOR...WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING TO FIND A GREAT QUALITY LETTERS FOR A GREAT PRICE!"
69085,1,"I love it. No tax, no shipping, no shopping in a store. Thank you amazon! Thank you Pampers. I somehow got my last shipment the next day!!!"
95567,1,Works excellent. Holds a lot of stuffed animals. I tried using command strips to save holes in the walls but they did not work. But i did fill it to the max with stuffed animals. Ended up with holes in the walls.
162372,2,"This kit is so-so. The nasal bulb is too pointy to stick up my son's nose. The one from the hospital is much better. I haven't used any of the other products because all meds come with their own droppers. The clippers are ok, but I have a hard time adjusting to the size of the handle."
173573,1,"This is a excellent product with a lot of options. It was easy to assemble and is of good quality. My son loves his swing and cries when I take him out of it. He even sleeps in his swing, with it off ofcourse. I would not recommend swinging without supervision. The only downfall is it drains the batteries rather quickly. I recommend that you get some rechargeable batteries to use in this swing. Also, it only operates on 4 D cell batteries, and does not have a power pack."
50505,0,"The first few nights of using the Leachco Snoogle were very restless. The stuffing felt too firm on my head and neck. Due to the shape of the pillow, if you try to move it to another position (in my case, the coiled position for sitting to a side lying position), be careful. The top of the pillow uncoiled, knocking down the contents of my nightstand. Due to hip pains, I cannot stay on one side very long, so swapping the pillow back and forth throughout the night can get a bit frustrating (for you and your partner). On a positive note, this pillow feels great tucked under my belly and between my knees for support. After it has been broken in a bit, it's not as firm on my head and neck."
13984,1,"We have to admit that after 3 weeks of our son crying after feeding time even though we burped him and burped him he still had GAS!!!! We tried the Playtex Brand. We tried the Johnson's Brand. He still got gas after feeding. I did some research and figured that the Avent system just might work. He took to it without fussing and low and behold NO GAS!!!! Of course there was the ususal burping, but afterward no crying and no gas. Thanks Avent! To those out there who say they get the dribble when feeding, I say: It's not the bottle on the bum. It's the bum on the bottle. You're feeding him wrong. To those who have problems with the formula coming out too slow or not at all, I say: Hello, have you ever heard of using a sterilized needle to clean it out? Nipples do get clogged you know. It's not the manufactures fault that you aren't keeping it clean. Remeber to sterilize both the bottle and the nipple. You need both working properly for a happy healthy baby."
80598,1,"Great deal! My daughter loves them. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it needs reclosable sides for when your in public places and it's a hassle to remove all the clothing and shoes to put on a pull up. Otherwise, they do the job and are cute."
5600,1,"I LOVE THIS ITEM,MY SON IS 2 YEARS OLD SO HE IS SOME WHAT ACTIVE IN THE BATHTUB SO THING GET WET SO THE ARM REST HELPES YOU FROM SLIPPING IN,THE KNEELER HELPES ALOT AND THE BEST THING IS THE POCKETS, JUST PUT THE BABY BATH AND SHAMPOO IN THERE AND YOU NEVER EVER NEED TO TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM YOUR CHILD.I LOVE THIS,IT IS A MUST HAVE!!!"
99016,1,when you subscribe! I recently subscribed to this product and it really does make a difference in price! I recommend if you've got little Pamper babies to just go ahead and subscribe to this product :) I saved a bit even with my first shipment! HAPPY mommy!
103646,0,"I pump a lot and I'm of two minds about this breast shield. On the one hand, I get much more milk when I pump using the Soft Fit shields than the regular ones. It's noticeably more. On the other hand, these babies hurt! It's supposed to ""massage"" your breast, but it seems much more like the shield is clinging to your skin. It compresses the breast hard and is especially painful for me when I'm taking them off, because they definitely stick to the skin surface. However, when I need to pump lots, I love that these are fast and efficient. And for me, pumping is about the end result, not the process, so I use these pretty often. When it gets a little bit too much and I start getting sore after pumping, I switch back to the Personal Fit shields for a little while."
147124,1,My daughter loves her spoons. She starts wanting to feed herself around 11month. At that time she is just holding this spoon and I would feed her using another one. Now she is 20month she is feeding herself using this spoon. Spoon size is perfect for her little hand and it's small so she can put the whole spoonful in her mouth. I love it becuase it's disher washer safe.
528,1,"The product is great, and Amazon service is exceptional.Pampers are great for my boys. Worked on my first son too. We are pampers fans."
52348,1,"This item was shipped very quickly by amazon as usual. The corner cushions were a little larger than I expected, but I liked this fact to do more cushion. I have a chest that has four corners with metal caps that if a child were to fall and hit would cause serious injury. After I put the cushions on, I now feel completely at ease about letting children play around the chest.The only con was the tape was a little tricky to apply. You will get through it though."
157721,1,"This mobile is GREAT! It will strap on to my daughter's car seat and her baby papasan, giving her entertainment that is often much needed so I can cook, etc. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that you have to wind it up pretty often and it just plays the same song over and over (How much is that doggie in the window)"
30169,0,Great concept. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the fabric. It feels more like something I'd buy at Target or Wal-Mart.
56878,1,"We bought this gate to keep our two dogs separate from our African Grey parrot. We were looking for a gate that was easy to maneuver and could take a great deal of traffic. North States Supergate fills our needs completely. We love how easy it is to open and close and especially love how it has a stay open feature. It was simple to install, by myself, in less than 15 min. I love it and when needed, will replace another gate (an Evenflo) that we have in the house with this very same model because it is so much easier to use."
168202,1,"When I was pregnant, I had 2 different mothers of boys tell me that Pampers Swaddlers were the best and it was not worth it to try any other - so I didn't. I didn't want to risk buying a big box of other diapers just to find they weren't as good. They are great diapers and the only leaks I've ever experienced was from the newborn Swaddlers when he was very close to the upper end of the pound limit. I started using the size 2 on my son when he was 11 lbs 8 oz and although it was not as snug as they should be around his legs, they've never leaked. Yes, they are more expensive than other brands, but I'd rather pay more than deal with leaks."
10741,1,"I use this for drying bottle parts, baby spoons, etc... (nothing too large) and it works great. It takes up very little space on the counter, unlike a regular dish rack and it also come with a double ended bottle brush which fits into it's own spot on the rack for storing. The only thing i don't like about this is that the &quot;arms&quot; that hold the bottles up fold down too easily. (they can be folded down to accomodate different sized items in the rack, but tend to fall over if the item is too heavy). But even with that minor problem, I'm extremely glad I bought it since it's helped to clean up the clutter of drying bottle parts on my counter top."
168880,1,"Pamper's almost never let us down. If we had a diaper blow out only because I put it on wrong. I would recommend Pampers to my friends. Well, at least it is perfectly working for us!"
175415,1,"This is a gorgeous crib set! It is exactly what we were wanting for our new son's room. If you are TIRED of the usual primary colors for boys - red, yellow, blue - then you will definitely love this set."
119738,1,"This bath tub is perfect for me and my son. I had initially bought a tub with a hammock that ""grew"" with your child, but this was much better for me. He was getting cold in the other bath because the hammock part only suspended him over the water. The best feature of this tub is the container used to rinse, it's huge! In the other tub, you only got a tiny scoop and it was hard to get in between the hammock and bath to get some water for rinsing, this one has much more room. Also this is so easy to clean and the little bit of foam is just enough cushion to make it comfortable. The thermometer was really helpful in the beginning, (being a nervous new mom, worried about the temperature) but I don't use it much now. You really don't need a fancy bath with all the bits and pieces, this simple one does the job really well!"
170610,0,"My son, 61/2 month, stuck his right hand inside the handle; he cried and we found out that his hand is between the car and it right handle. So, we have to break the handle to take out his hand. We love the product very much, if the handle is easy to replace, it will be better."
84759,1,This does work. It keeps my 3 year old from getting out. But locking and unlocking the door can be a hassle. And I think after a while he will figure out how to take it off the knob anyway. Worth the price and would recommend but like a lot of these things not perfect. Since he was going outside by himself the extra hassle with these is worth it though. His safety is our biggest priority.
109928,1,Sturdy and soft and keeps my son warm. He knows it's night time when he puts on the scak.
152265,1,"We love this product! We received this as a gift and laughed about it but now my son can hardly sleep without it. The controls that you set go for 10 minutes then auto shut-off. There is a button to allow it to restart using the last used settings when baby cries. I love that feature because it means I don't have to disturb him and it often lulls him back to sleep quickly. It has room for improvement, though. This thing eats batteries like crazy! It takes 4C's for the vibration unit and 4AA's for the control unit. I highly recommend getting rechargable batteries - two sets of each so one can be charging while the other is working. The battery compartment is also rather difficult to access on the control unit, as it is inside the curve where it hooks on the crib rail. The product states that it transmits up to 15 feet but really only goes about 3 or 4 feet at the most. Some monitor frequencies interfere, too, but that's easily fixed by moving the monitor or switching the frequency. Overall, I'm very pleased with it, though."
139361,1,My daughter loves her constellation light. She carries it everywhere with her. It came so fast in the mail and i was very impressed. This light is fun and really awesome in a dark room and my little girl shows it off to everybody!
24484,0,"It was not stated that this is not for the use of top of stairs. That was what I wanted it for, and it wasnt until I started reading the directions, that I found that out. [...]"
127575,2,"The crib is solid enough and fairly easy to install, however, the front rail is fixed so low that it is impossible to slide anything underneath to store it. For example, we have another crib that we store boxes of diapers and wipes underneath. Look at the clearance on the lower front frame, you can't slide anything more than like 5 inches underneath..."
65594,1,"Beautiful colors! Great quality! It's a nice change from what's in style right now, and the price is great on amazon."
168381,2,"I really wanted these to work, as our hospital uses these diapers. We tried them at home with both of our young sons. However, we would find them waking up frequently screaming and crying. It took a while to figure out that the problem was the diaper. Peeing into these diapers was waking them up. Once we changed diaper brands, the screaming immediately stopped.I write this not so much to complain about Pampers as to advise new parents to consider that a possible source of their very young child's crying and interrupted sleep could be the particular type of diaper the baby wears. Every child is different. I am still on quest to find a reliable diaper for baby #2. We've tried at least 10 brands, and every one has issues. However, Pampers is the only one to provoke screaming.I give Pampers one star for the very helpful wetness indicator and one star because the overall quality seems decent. They just don't work for us. Good luck in your quest to find a diaper that suits your needs. If you are unsure, try a small pack first."
136922,1,"Very pleased with the Infantino Happy Hula shopping cart cover. It is large enough to cover the entire sitting area and sides of big carts at Sam's Club, Wal-Mart, etc. and is a snap to arrange on the cart. My daughter puts everything in her mouth and with the cover on she is able to sit comfortably without my worrying about germs from the cart. However, I have learned that the leg openings are a bit too big and my baby can and does drop things through there, like her pacifer or one of the detachable toys. Overall, I think this is a great buy!"
22848,1,My child loves to be in this sling! The first time I put him in he fell asleep within a minute. What a lifesaver!
40982,1,"Tried alot of cheaper diapers before settling on Pampers. Thought the price was high but it turns out they are worth it! No leaks, comfortable fit, very little pilling onto baby's bum."
81380,1,"I bought this stroller 2 Years back and it is still working, it is very light and comfortable, would recommond this to others."
110671,1,"Imagine placing a play yard next to your bed. That is how large this is! I dont know why I was expecting something smaller since I know it could be used as a play yard as well as a co-sleeper. But anyways, I was suprised at the size. Otherwise, it did not take long to put together it is a very simple design. I think we will get alot of use out of it!"
131949,0,"This is great in concept and seemed to work fine...we have a small home and were looking to use space efficiently. However, we did not get a chance to really test it out since it turned out our baby HATED the carseat!"
15394,1,"I am a mother of twins who have sensitive skin. My cousin gave us a bottle of this last year and we absolutely love it. It is great for their sensitive skin and it smells soooo good! I really like it much better than Aveno's baby wash! This soap lathers up so much better than Aveno but also dissipates in the tub water so it doesn't get too sudsy. A little goes a long way. I even have all my girlfriends with twins hooked on it now too! We all love it and am really glad that Amazon carries it! Try it, you won't be disappointed!Mamma to Kaia and Kolby, 10 months"
19783,1,"The yellow nipples are MUCH, much softer and more boob-like. We tried every bottle out there, even the ""hippy"" brands designed to be more breast-like. The drop ins with the YELLOW (only the yellow!) nipples do the trick."
87816,1,My daughter loves this. She is 2 months old and everyday in the afternoon we play with this. She gets so excited when I put her on the matt. She is learning to touch the toys in front of her and she smiles at &quot;the other baby&quot; in the mirror. Smiply wonderful!
169564,0,"I bought this bag after reading so many great reviews. It is a quality bag and hooks up great to our chicco stroller. My reason for writing this review is to let people know that it is not very big. It looks deceiving. Of course you could read the dimensions but it is hard to picture sometimes without just seeing it. My daughter was born 14 weeks early and so we have many doctor appts. We live 3 hours from the hospital and have to pack for an 8 hour day. I take 2 changes of clothes, three bottles, formula (just enough for 3 bottles), 3 bibs, 2 burp cloths, 5 diapers and small travel pack of wipes and it barely fits. I know it seems like a lot but it compacts down pretty easily. It has a lot of great pockets on the outside but when you put stuff in them it bulks up and takes up the room on the inside. The pockets are great for seperating your stuff but not for extra space. It is a great bag for both mom and dad and good for going to a friends house for a couple hours but i just can't see doing much more than that with this bag. Sad because it is a quality made bag. It just isn't efficient with its space."
13901,2,"These bottles were great when we were only giving small amounts of formula to supplement nursing. We never had problems with nipple confusion and the flow was perfect. We were only putting one or two ounces in a bottle, so if it did leak it wasn't a big deal. Now that we are using 100% formula they are a pain. There is nothing more enjoyable then being soaked in formula at 3 in the morning. There are things you can do to help/prevent leaking, but who wants to fuss that much with a bottle when they have a crying hungry baby. Especially if you are trying to hold a baby and make a bottle at the same time. We recently purchased some ventaire bottles and they have been great. There also appears to be a decrease in how much our daughter spits up and gas fussiness. The opening is smaller, so it is harder to mix in the bottle. I found it works great to make a days worth of formula in a separate container and then pour into the bottles. Shaking formula in the bottle creates a ton of air bubbles, so we have found spit-up/gas problems were reduced by mixing separately with a spoon anyways. Unfortuanetly there is no perfect bottle for those that choose or have to bottle feed."
41929,1,"This is the only type of sippy that my son will drink from. I love that it's an innexpensive cup, but also durable. He tosses it around like a typical one year old but it never leaks! The valve can possibly be dislodged with some hard knocks, but it's only happened to us once so far."
142925,0,"We really like this gate. we have 2 kids who will be 2 and 4 pretty soon and after having several kitchen disasters I went and purchased this gate.It is easy to install, looks nice (the cream color blends in well) the only reason I give it 3 stars is that the child lock spring worsk without pushing both red buttons. It is suposed to remain locked and only be able to be opened if you squeese the red buttons on both sides and pull back on the lock. Well the lock can be pulled back w/o the buttons being pushed.But it is a heavy spring and would not be easy for a kid to just pull back anyway. It's nice and tall also."
112572,0,"Pampers are by far the best diapers that we have used and are certainly worth 5 stars. The reason I gave them only 3 is because of the price. I can get them at Babies R Us or BJ's Wholesale Club for the exact same price. Why would I pay the additional price of the shipping and buy them from Amazon. I have come to expect the best prices from Amazon, however that is not the case in this situation. I am truly disappointed that Amazon does not have a better price."
127511,0,"I agree with other reviewers- this is a very nice crib but boy does it scratch easily (we bought cherry). It had some scratches already when we bought it, and then got some more after assembly- once when my cat jumped up on it, and another when my husband tried to rub the cat scratch, and scratched it some more with his fingernail. All in all, it's cosmetic, but it's a disappointment as the scratches are on the front center of the rail (and we don't even have a baby yet).Another reviewer suggested contacting the manufacturer about scratches, and I did that- they offered to sell me a touch up pen for about $11. GEESH. The least they could do was provide that free of charge!all in all, It looks OK from a distance and is very sturdy so baby will sleep well,but I'm disappointed by the scratching and the customer service."
50063,1,"I couldn't wait for this item to return to the stores. My mother thought I was nuts because I kept searching online and baby retail stores for the improved item. When I saw it in a particular store, I grabbed it, made sure it said improved, and purchased it! I love this item!!! I am the type of person who hate strollers, especially heavy ones so my first carrier purchase was the baby bjorn carrier. My son was born in the fall and I didn't get much use of it. The last time I used it was when he was 5 months (15 lbs)and it was approved for up to 20 lbs. I thought my back was going to cave in. Joey, now 8 months loves the hip hammock and I do too. You have to make sure the straps are tightly fitted around your waist and shoulder, otherwise you will experience a little shoulder pressure. However, unlike the leading front carriers, the baby's weight is distributed on the hip which is the best way to carry such weight.The reason why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because after adjusting the straps, they hang long and get in the way. I fix this problem by attaching an adhesive velcro on the back side of each strap to keep them secure. Other than that, I am so happy I was able to purchase and make use of this product, Joey and I absolutely LOVE IT!"
33329,1,"These definitely keep my sore nipples from chafing or sticking to my bra. They look funny thru my shirt, kinda like a pointy Madonna bra, but who cares when you're in agony from cracked nipples? My only complaint is that I wish I could wear them all the time. The directions say to not wear longer than 40 minutes at a time since they put pressure on your milk ducts. But, I'll take whatever relief I can get!"
87236,0,"I loved these bottles when my daughter was a newborn, they're super convenient and easy to keep clean. The nipples are a perfect shape to help your baby maintain the correct latch when switching between bottle and breast. The problem came about as my daughter got older: the 8 oz liners don't hold 8 oz of water and the appropriate amount of powdered formula. If you don't use ready-to-feed formula or a liquid concentrate, or if you don't want to make all of your formula in a separate container and transfer it in when it's feeding time, these may not be the bottles for you. When I contacted customer service about it I was told that I should ""mix in a seperate container and then add the leftovers in after my baby clears some space."" This from a woman who's obviously never tried to take a bottle from a hungry baby."
57003,1,"I received the gate today & had it installed in less than 15 minutes or so. Other revievers of this gate have mentioned that it looked bent when they received theirs. Mine looked bent too, buty there is a label on the package saying that it will look this way until installed. I guess the original packaging did not mention that fact and several people returned their gates and complained here about them.It takes a couple of minutes to get the gate mounting just right and for getting the latch mechanism to work smoothly, but really no big deal at all. I did not use the screws to mount the 4 mounting cups yet to the door jambs, but I will tomorrow. The pressure fit into the jamb is pretty secure by itself, but I will put the screws in, and it should only take about 5 minutes or so to do that.This gate is well made and should last a long time from the way it looks. It does have some plastic parts, but I think they should be OK; time will tell.I saw pretty much the same gate at ""the"" major pet supply store, and it was selling at almost twice the price as on Amazon. And Prime shipping is great too."
175533,1,"I had bought some gates from Menards to gate off my kitchen during the day for my pets while I am at work. I bought the wooden scissor gates at almost $30.00 a piece, and with my three dogs, they lasted 3 days. I purchased these heavy duty gates at a very good price (2 for the price of one at M) and they are still going strong after 3 weeks. Very easy to assemble. You are able to take down with little ease when not in use. Great product."
122997,1,"I knew I would be pumping when I went back to work, but ended up needing to pump way before that, as my little one had a really hard time nursing at first. This product is GREAT! It fits directly onto my Medela Pump-in-Style and the bottles are BPA-free and thin enough that the milk warms quickly in them. The system comes with plugs, but I only used them on the bottles I put in the freezer. The lids are fine for preventing leaks as long as you screw them on tightly. You can feed straight from the bottle, which is really nice (use a standard nipple and collar - Evenflo's standard nipple is what we use), or you can pour it into a larger bottle if your little one eats more than 4 oz. at a time. (We like the nipple/venting system on the Born Free bottlesBorn Free 5oz. Wide Neck- Twin Pack, so we pour into those bottles at home, but take a regular nipple and collar with us when we go out.) I wish you could buy lids and labels separately, but not a huge deal. I recommend this to any breastfeeding mother who thinks they might want to pump. FANTASTIC product!"
56853,0,"I've used this high chair for about 8 months; my son is now almost 1 year 2 months old. I bought it because I liked the idea of natural wood rather than plastic because of environmental reasons, and because I reasoned a wooden chair would ultimately last years longer than a metal-and-plastic one. (The tray assembly, by the way, is all plastic, as is most of the frameword that the tray snaps onto. Everything else, is solid wood, doesn't look like particleboard.)The chair is extremely easy to assemble -- just four large bolt-like screws. But, every few months the bolts loosen, and one or another falls out onto the floor. (Yes, they're swallow-able, and fairly large too, so it's a hazard that absolutely should not be. Deserves a recall, if you ask my opinion.) Periodically, I must go around tightening the bolts. I should note there is one bolt that is most prone to loosening & falling out, so maybe there is a fluke manufacturing problem with that one bolt. But the other bolts loosen a bit, too.About 4 months ago, my baby began to cry whenever placed in the chair, and make his legs go straight & rigid to prevent us from getting him into the chair. Took some time to figure out he didn't dislike being fed... rather, the chair is too hard for him. So I folded a towel up, slipped it under the seat cover, up the back, draped it over the headrest part of the chair, and in one day the rigid-legs syndrome stopped, and the baby seemed happy with the chair. (And, some other strange behavior disappeared too -- such as a rocking head-banging that might have been a sign of discomfort, or might just be some normal eccentric baby behavior.) It was clear to me, that the wood of the chair was too firm or its lack of sculpturing was uncomfortable for the baby.Laying down that towel isn't easy, since the seat fits so snugly under the bar that goes between his legs, that it's difficult to stuff a towel under there in addition.I found the straps, intended to hold the baby in place, to be absolutely worthless. Somehow, it was nearly impossible to get them positioned properly so they went around his waist (just the physical arrangement of the straps.) Fortunately, the seat without the straps seems to hold the baby securely enough that we never felt he was in danger of falling out, even when he leans way over to watch what happens to the food he drops onto the floor (one of his favorite activities.)Other than the above, I've found the chair to be just fine. It doesn't tip at all; the seat cover material is fairly easy to clean (a few stains haven't come out, most do.) The thin inner tray snaps off easily for cleaning (unlike other commentors', my baby doesn't snap the lid off himself, and it attaches tightly enough that I don't think he ever will.) The entire tray assemble latches on/off easily enough that it's never a problem.So it's a pity this chair, which seems environmentally friendly, turns out to be uncomfortable, and drops its bolts in an alarming manner."
141853,1,Seems to work well. My baby can pull it up with his teeth in spots but we just adhere it right back. Maybe a bit stronger tape.
22235,1,"I bought this for my 4 month old and wish I'd bought it sooner. The bassinet part is great, just the right height. The toys are way too high for her to reach but otherwise it's great."
89105,0,"seemed like everytime we went and tried to pull out a wipe, we ended up getting two or three. Honestly the wipes just seemed thicker than what we would need."
16527,1,"These burp cloths are absolutely gorgeous. I received this item at my baby shower, after putting it on my registry, thinking it was overpriced and never thinking anyone would pay this money. Well I received two bibs and a set of burp cloths and I can't wait to use them. The material is so soft and a beautiful shade of pink. Perfect for that little princess. I'm going to buy some myself."
94089,1,It takes about 5 mins to heat but that's what the directions tell you. It works great and it's cheap. I would recommend this item.
56790,2,"I am insane when it comes to researching products for my toddler and knew all the pros and cons of this potty chair. However, I love the Baby Bjorn line and have never been disappointed before, so I bought this one even after ready several negative reviews. I really wanted a simple chair for my 2 year old daughter. Well, she loved the idea of it too, but was frustrated by the shield on the bucket (as apparently most girls are). She kept trying to turn the bucket around so the shield would be out of the way, but it doesn't fit that way. The chair does slide around as well, but we fixed that by positioning it in the corner. After 2 days of trying, she just couldn't overlook how uncomfortable the chair was. She's an average sized two year old, but it still was a tight fit. We returned the chair and, after much deliberation and testing, purchased the Graco soft seat potty chair. I do not like the Graco brand usually, but so far that chair is doing the trick."
172564,2,"I just gave my 2 1/2 month old his first bath in this thing, It was a nightmare. The hose that attaches to the pump is way too long causing kinks that stop the water. Then the hose itself pumps out such an inadequate pressure of water. I mean I am not looking for a fire hose, But, I would like something that will get the soap out of his hair. He doesn't fit in the tub in the ""newborn"" position, and he was too reclined for stage 3 and he HATED it. It takes up a silly amount of space. it takes SIX AA batteries.The bath sling actually has ""swimming with the fishies"" written on it among other things.I would never recommend this to anyone."
143995,1,We got this because we didn't want to make holes in the nice wood banister at the top of our staircase. It works great. We will buy another for the bottom of the stairs.
162792,1,"After we use the snack trap a few times, I noticed dirt can go into it and the food is not kept fresh because there is an opening on the lid. I tried ordering a cover lid for these, but their website was not processing my credit card. I called AND emailed the company more than once and no one responded back to me. What kind of business are they in when they only listen to their voice mails once a week? And what is the point of a ""snack trap"" when it doesn't really trap the food in? And it doesn't keep the food fresh but make them stale. I don't like to just throw the snack trap containers into the diaper bag without putting a plastic over it. Anyway, have changed over to the Munchkin brand. They are cleaner and BPA Free. At least, someone from that company answers their phone like within 2 rings. Anyway, we tossed these out and I gave my family and friends the Munchkin brand."
18142,1,"My daughter got this for her ""shower"" and she absolutely loved it. She would lie mesmerized by the musical star and also loved playing with, reaching for, grabbing, and eventually even taking off all the things that hang from the various loops. It's got great colors and shapes and overall is just terrific. This is a great great item - one of the best we've found.At about 7-8 months, the thrill wore off. Now she crawls over/through it and moves on.: )"
10686,2,This rack worked great when our daughter used the Playtex Ventaire bottles but it totally stunk when she was using teh Avent and Dr. Brown's wide neck bottels. They were jsut too wide to fit in the rack. Add the collars and nipples were all too big to fit in the compartment. We really had problems when we had all teh pieces of the Dr. Brown's to deal with too. We tried a couple other drying racks too...Prince Lionheart and Munchkins...but we never found one that really worked for us. Most times we just washed them and laid them on a towel on the counter to dry
54218,1,I like this product very much except for one thing. You are unable to play music only or run the mobile only. It would be nice to not have to have both music and mobile going at once.
90866,0,"I love pampers but these diapers are just not that great. We seemed to have a lot of blow outs with these. They just do not seem to be made as nice as their other diapers. In my opinion it is worth spending the few extra dollars and getting the pampers swaddlers! They just seem to fit a so much better, hold more baby surprises:), and have the wetness indicator which as an exhausted new mom is a really nice thing to have!"
147912,0,"I was so excited about this item that I preordered it. I love the rainforest theme and was disappointed that it hadn't come out earlier so that this could have been the theme for all of my daughter's baby gear (she is almost 5 months).We got the bouncer a week ago and I can't begin to say how disappointed I was. It isn't nearly as long as the picture suggests and the toys on the toy bar come down way too low. It is almost to the point where she can't play with them because they hit her legs - not to mention the rings that are suppose to attach to the bottom of the monkey - there is no room to attach them. My daughter is only 13 pounds and this is suppose to be good up to a 25 lb baby. I can't imagine if she was any bigger. And the rings come off way too easily anyways - my daughter has them both off within seconds (I attach them to the monkey's ears).On the plus side, my daughter is very interested with everything and loves to watch and listen to everything that is happening and she loves the toys on the toy bar. But unless I got a defective model it was just very poorly constructed."
94570,2,"I, just as the other new moms thought that the Avent bottles were suppose to be really good. Well, let me tell you that they are not. If you don't put the cover on ""just right"" they will leak. I can go just about a whole feeding without it leaking and then right at the end it will leak. I would not recommend these bottles."
184632,1,We received these knit crib sheets as a shower gift. They are so stretchy and easy to put on a crib mattress. I put a waterproof crib pad under it. I even layer another waterproof pad and a second sheet for faster bed changes should an accident occur.
10971,1,"We just bought this in orange, three years after buying the lime green one. We have never had any trouble with this booster, and I love them because they are easy to clean, don't slip, fit on most chairs and are easy to take with us if needed. They are lightweight but very stable. When they get dirty I put it in the sink and scrub it with a sponge and dish soap. My daughter is now 5 and a little on the short side, so she still uses it. My son is 2.5 and is getting his own now that he is outgrowing the high chair."
132955,2,"One would be better served to use a tall cardboard box and long plastic bag, than to invest in the over-priced DIAPER DEKER XL. The left side of the double-door push-lid does not function; it is continually open, which does not help odor control. What else is this expensive thing supposed to do? Reviews were outstanding, but it came with no instructions. Intuitive? Turn the only dial, and nothing happens. The bag is not twisted at the top of the last deposit, to further trap in the odor. I cannot return because the THREE-DAYlimit is over! I'm not a machine, nor on a time-table. Most returns are do-able within 30 days, which is satisfactory. I am very, very sorry that I went through the expense of getting this to 'help' my husband with PD. Think twice about laying out hard-earned money for the Diaper Deker. If you bought one, KEEP THE BOX!!!"
7793,1,My little granddaughter seems to be picky about which bottle nipple she will use. These VenAire Advanced Wide Natural shaped silicone nipples are her preference. We have tried a lot of them and find these work the best.
70302,2,"This gate took my husband and I almost 2 hours to install. Then once you make 8 holes in your walls, you find out it is the most difficult gate to open, and the latch is a piece of garbage. The most frustrating part is that after you finally install it and realize you hate it and you have put so much time and energy into it - not to mention its now attached to your walls - - you don't want to return it and start over...."
37678,0,"I bought this booster seat about 7 months ago. It has served us pretty well, we use it almost constantly and it's still fully functional.What I like about it:1. It's portable-I would rather my kiddo eat on this at restaurants than sit on those nasty sticky highchairs. Plus she's little for her age so she fits in this thing better than restaurant highchairs.2. You can easily get the tray off and throw it in the dishwasher. We have been using it as a plate because baby throws actual plates. This way she gets to self feed and we don't get flying plates during dinner.3. Extremely easy to clean-we have a fabric covered high chair and this thing. I can get this booster cleaned off in seconds whereas the highchair requires disassembly and a trip for the cover through the washer.4. It was CHEAP! I really didn't want to spend 30 or 40 bucks on a booster seat and the price of this one was perfect.What I don't like:1. It was not immediately obvious how to put the safety straps on the thing. The picture and crummy instructions were not helpful.2. You gotta WATCH little fingers with the swinging tray. I accidentally smashed my baby's fingers when locking the tray one time. I think this could happen with anything where you have a tray that you attach to something, but another time when the tray was not locked closed, baby started swinging it open and shut and smashed her other finger in the hinge where the tray is set into the seat.3. The back has popped off of it a couple of times. Didn't hurt anybody but it was annoying.So you can see why I am on the fence. We are using it daily and it's still fully functional, but we have had some incidences...I think it would be a good product for someone who is aware going in that they need to watch the fingers at all times! The fact that baby got hurt in it and the crummy assembly instructions is why I am taking away two stars."
91863,1,"I must say it did it's job well. I still use it with my son and we have had it for several months now. It folds up nicely and comes with a little plastic zip lock type bag and I just keep it in that. I am able to let my son sit on it on even the oval/big seat you find in the public restrooms. You place it on the front part and then it just kinda hangs over the middle. I think the handles in the front are a bit useless but that is a cosmetic flaw in my mind. I will say that you need to watch your LO closely just to make sure they are on there right and if you have a wiggly one to make sure they don't fall. I would Definitely recommend this to a friend and buy it again if I had to. It is a lot sturdier then some of the others I've seen! Oh and BTW My son is over 3 and 40lbs and it does hold him, he has never fallen on this thing!"
62371,1,I Love the JJ Cole Bundleme. My baby looks very comfortable when i put her in it to go out. it is so soft & it keeps my baby very warm & protected.
36149,0,"I ordered this sling for me and my grand daughter. She is 4 months old and large for her age. This sling did not fit well for us. It seemed like the &#34;Pocket&#34; was too deep for her and scrunched her legs up, when we tried it with her legs out I thought it put too much pressure on her legs.Over all, it didn't fit my body type well, and she seemed frustrated and uncomfortable in it. She loves the Moby, I was just looking for something simpler. This doesn't seem to be it.It probably will work well for someone who isn't as busty as I am. The fabric quality is good, light and seems like it would be easy to clean."
137781,1,This is a great little product that serves as both a nite light and a teaching tool. Both our daughter and grandson are delighted.
15472,1,"Works great keeping my 13 month old contained. We have a big play room and after 15 minutes after installing He doesn't even mess with it any more. Other reviewers complained of children figuring out the gate latch. I can't see a child under 2.5 doing it. The hinges could be made of a stronger material than plastic, but I haven't had a problem in it's first 3 months."
157201,1,"I decided not to invest in this pump, as my doctor advised me that a cheap one would work just as well. I purchased a $40 single pump and used it for the first 3 months. At that point, I borrowed the ""pump in style"" from a friend and could not believe the difference. I have been using it now for 6 months and cannot begin to calculate the amount of time saved by using this pump. Make sure you're going to stick with nursing for a while first, then purchase it if you can!!"
99758,1,Love the Pampers Baby Dry! Definately keeps our little one's bottom nice and dry! They are very soft and very obsorbant! Will buy these again and again! Love Pampers!
81834,0,"I bought this pump when I had my second child. I used it only at work 2-3 times or less 5 days a week for about six months. And for my third child for 1 month before it lost all suction power. It was great for the first week I used it on the suction end of things but day by day got less and less suction. It never expressed milk for me unless I was either massaging my breasts or using hand expression technics while pumping. It took alot of time to get even 2 oz of milk because the motor starts to wear out very soon after the first use which disappointed me. I didnt expect it to last forever, but atleast a year of fulltime use would be nice. It may be good for occasional use, but I wouldnt recommend it for everyday use."
23272,1,"This product has worked great for me. I had 2 of these with my daughter and now only have 1, but am looking to buy another.I am a hyperlactator--product lots of milk. I have plenty to store and am building up quite a frozen supply by using the ""Milk Savers"" product since I leak a lot from one breast while feeding with the other.Anyhow, I also do NOT freeze my milk in this storage unit. I put my milk into Lansinoh bags, freeze them laying down flat on a shelf in my freezer and once frozen I transfer to this unit.It holds lots of bags when frozen completely flat. Plus they thaw so much quicker this way. The most I've frozen per bag is 5 ounces though.If you run out of space with this product, like I did, simply take off the lid and use it as a storage tray! This will double the amount of bags you can neatly organize in your freezer.A great product. I wish it weren't so pricey though. I need another Amazon $10 coupon. : )"
20185,2,"My mother purchased these bottles for me for my 1 week old son, and I have already moved on to a different bottle. The size is fine, and I like that it's wider and not as tall, but the whole deal with unscrewing the bottom to make the formula come out was just too much hassle. What's worse is that I didn't realize I had to do that at first, and my poor baby was sucking on the bottle forever and not getting anything out! Once I realized that I had to unscrew the bottom to make the vaccuum work, I had to tighten the bottom to set it down and then try and loosen it again with one hand while feeding. Once I turned the bottle too loose, and formula came out way too fast and my son almost choked. Not the worst bottles, but not my personal favorite."
79805,1,"I got this snuggle nest just before our son was born thinking it might come in handy. Well, it is fabulous! It keeps him ""protected"" within solid walls while still allowing him to be close enough to sense and smell us. It also keeps life easy for me when he wakes in the middle of the night to nurse or get a diaper change. I don't have to wait for him to cry loud enough to wake me from another room. I hear him fuss and 'bam', I'm awake. Also, the DVD that came with the item is FANTASTIC! The Happiest Baby on the Block, ROCKS! Definately a must see for any new parent whether having your first or 10th (alright well maybe not 10th as by then you are some kind of child rearing god & goddess). It is amazing to see the techniques described actually work when applied to my own baby.I will say if you have a small bed (ie., anything smaller than queen or extended queen) you will probably be cramped pretty bad with the snuggle nest placed in the middle."
150134,1,"I was so excited to order this seat, i loved the britax companion and was sure i would love this one too. I ordered the All star blue shown as a gorgeous aqua blue and was really disappointed in the actual color of it. Its really gray in color and nothing like the picture they have on their site. which was the main reason i picked this print. but thats the only negative thing my son LOVES this seat its really comfy and he loves falling asleep in it definitely not like store brand ones. the comfort and safety provided definitely makes it worth the price.So basically love the seat Hate the color of the true all star blue (the should call it gray)"
137153,1,the snugglewool bassinet pad was the only size pad that would fit my odd-sized changing table which came with a paper-thin vinyl cushion. My baby LOVED being put on this pad from birth. We use a bassinet sheet over it - I now want one for the crib. It is so comfy!
55464,2,"I was looking forward to using this, but it did not function as I had hoped. Following the instructions on how much water to use based on the size of the bottle, the first bottle I tried still came out cold. I then increased the amount of water to put in, and the bottle came out hot, but the formula was still cold. Then it says you have to wait 10 minutes to use it again! I am going to return it and stick with the microwave. Shaking the formula afterwards gets rid of any fears of &quot;hot spots&quot; in the bottle that the baby might feel."
110555,1,"We love this compact changing do-it-all kit. It's got a travel wipes box, 2 mesh pockets, one for the wipes, one for 2-3 diapers. It rolls/folds up and then velcros closed. VERY HANDY! it also has a strap that you can velcro onto your purse handle, stroller, whatever. We lost ours and I'm purchasing a new one because I just can't live without it! ha ha"
116385,2,"This gate was made about 2 inches out of square, it would not close or latch, and would not fit properly in a doorway. At first I thought it had been damaged during shipping, but it was just made improperly. I would not recommend this product. I saw where someone else had this problem too, and I thought I would take a chance, since I liked the color and style, but no luck."
142784,0,"The quality of the valance is nice, for the price its good. The Max color is listed as 82"" though, and in reality its only 53"". We had to wind up ordering two to fit our window."
27219,2,"I didn't mind what I received. It was a wooden letter. I just don't know why a different ornament is pictured. I wanted to return them since I bought a bunch for my daughter and other relatives for Christmas but it was less than 2 dollars, i figured what the heck. Put the right picture of the product you are selling please!"
141565,2,I bought this toy based on the reviews about how great it was for pre-walkers and how the wheels didnt move as quickly as other walkers. I didn't find this to be the case. It was way to fast for my 10 month old who is not quite walking on his own. We even tried to rig it up to slow the wheels down and it was so light even without the wheels moving it was just sliding across our laminate flooring. The only place he was able to use it without me holding onto it was out in the grass. The music and lights on it are completely overwhelming for a baby. Each button plays a little song or music and hitting another button just interrupts that and starts a new song. And we wonder why so many kids have problems focusing and paying attention?! I ended up forking out the money for a wooden style one with an adjustable brake and a little seat and he loves that one!
74006,2,"Eight years ago, when our oldest was 5 and our second-born was 1, we bought the original Sit and Stand Deluxe. At the time, we thought the world of it -- the baby could sit up or recline in the front, while our kindergartner could stand and see everything as we strolled, and could sit when he grew tired.We now have a 3 year old with a baby due in two months, and we knew we would need another double-style stroller (our original Sit and Stand was garage-sale fodder years ago). At Babies R Us I immediately headed to the Stand On Tandem Stroller, remembering how well this worked for our oldest two. We learned very quickly that it does NOT work for an active toddler/preschooler. Among the problems:1. The front seat does not fully recline; it only partially reclines. The baby would have to be able to sit comfortably before being able to use the stroller.2. The adapter that supposedly accepts all infant car seats did not accept either the Evenflo infant seat or the Graco SnugRide infant seat that we tried at the store. The sales associate also could not get the SnugRide to lock onto the stroller.3. When the front seat is in the reclined position, the back of the seat takes up all the room in the rear where the older child would be sitting.4. When the front seat is in the reclined position, it is virtually impossible to access the storage basket beneath the seat.5. When an older child is seated, the storage basket is inaccessible.6. If your older child is tired, there is nowhere for him or her to sit comfortably or supported -- just the narrow little bench.7. With our 3 year old seated on the bench and nothing in the front where a baby would sit, this stroller did not steer very easily. With our 3 year old seated in the front, this stroller still did not steer very easily.8. The standing platform with handgrips does work well, but let's face it. Two to three year olds get tired or bored of being in the same position very quickly, and then they either have to sit on the bench (provided the front seat is not reclined) or they have to be carried or they must walk. We tried to convince our 3 year old to go for a ride standing up, and he lasted all of 3 minutes before he started fidgeting and letting go of the handholds, creating a safety issue. The standing platform should work well for a preschooler/older child, but forget it for the 2- to 3-year-old set.9. A minor detail, but there is no storage stray or cupholder for the parent.Yes, it is very lightweight and folds compactly when compared to other double strollers, but the negatives far outweigh the positives. We went with the Graco Duoglider instead, and strongly recommend to any parents considering this stroller that they go to a Babies R Us store and actually try it out before purchasing it."
57982,0,"Pros:1. night lamp2. warms bottle!3. auto-off feature4. cooler to keep bottles cool when not in use5. can also be used as facial spa!cons:1. can't predict how warm the bottle is. sometimes it over-does the job2. though has the auto-off feature, never got to that stage. always had to remove the bottle because it was getting too hot.3. short cord4. large size"
89351,1,"I got this because there is a deal. Before I bought this, review said this is a little harder than sensitive one. But that depends. My baby love it! I will continue to use it."
63880,2,"I recently purchased this item as a gift for my sister who has a new baby.However, the item that was sent to her was NOT the Kiddopotamus brand swaddle blanket!!A similar item of a different brand was sent to her. She decided to keep it, however, this is completely unacceptable. An online retailer cannot simply just ship a different item - albeit a similar one - instead of what was ordered!!I am irate about this. She wanted the Kiddopotamus one, I wanted to get her a gift. Instead, because some incompetent Amazon employee decided a different item would be just as good, this gift-giving experience was a fail. I explained to my sister that Amazon returns are easy but since she's the go-along, get-along type she won't be doing a return, even though she was visibly disappointed when she opened the package and saw it was not the Kiddopotamus blanket.If you want the Kiddopotamus swaddle blanket, go buy it in a store. Don't order it here because who knows what you'll actually end up getting.Furthermore, I will never order a gift from Amazon again. They have lost any and all future gift-related business from me, and I'd advise you to do the same if you actually care about having the right gift sent, rather than playing gift roulette with Amazon."
87850,1,"We received the Gymini as a Baby Shower gift and our daughter loved it! It is obviously a little overwhelming until they are about 2 months old but she learned to roll over by trying to touch and lick the colorful blanket underneath. She spent many hours playing and observing everything it had to offer. It is wonderful to wash, just take off the side bars (locks in with snaps) and throw in the wash, hang dry. It was wonderful! Once she learned how to roll over we stopped using the mat but she still loves the toys it comes with. Great gift idea!"
167107,1,"This is a nice seat, but the cover is scratchy and hot. It also shows every bit of spit up terribly. I like the Gracopedic foam because it is more plush than the standard snugrides. However, in the summer, I would have preferred a cotton cover for softness."
133011,2,"My husband and I received the Diaper Dekor about 7-1/2 months ago as a baby shower gift and absolutely loved it. At first. It really is incredibly easy to use, refill, and empty. Also, a lot of people complain about the 'expensive' refills but let me stress that the refills last a VERY long time. Our daughter is just under 8 months old and we have only gone through 2 boxes of refills, which (at $22/refill box) equates out to about 18 cents/day ($5.50/month). As far as keeping out odors, as far as we knew it worked great, but we have a breastfed baby, so that's not saying much since her poopy diapers really didn't smell badly to begin with. We've been able to get away with only emptying it out once a week with no problem. However, a few weeks ago, the problems started. As our daughter has steadily been increasing her solid food intake her diapers have obviously been getting smellier. As a result, we've noticed that the Diaper Dekor doesn't actually hold in smells as well as we originally thought. However, the odor still wasn't too bad so we were still pretty happy with it. But then today, the trapdoor that you drop the diapers through broke! Now one of the trapdoors is just hanging open and is not keeping in the odor at all and the whole nursery smells like poopy diaper. So, basically now all we have is a very expensive trash can. We just went out and bought the Neat diaper disposal system, and hopefully that will work better. Given the cost of this thing, we were quite disappointed that it didn't even last for 8 months.The other thing that concerns me that other parents have pointed out is this: is the Diaper Dekor TOO easy to use? The top part that you drop the diapers into and the main bottom door through which you access the bag of diapers to empty out or refill are way too easy for an older baby or toddler to figure out how to open (and many of them have). Not only can they open the thing and play with the diapers and plastic bags, but they can EASILY play with the cutter on the side of the door. Although the cutter is narrow enough to where I can't fit my finger in it, my baby probably could if she got the door open.Perhaps other Diaper Dekors are built much stronger than this one; perhaps ours was a manufacturing fluke. However, reading through some of these reviews, I know ours is not the only one where the door(s) have broken. I think the manufacturer needs to beef up the quality of their construction as well as come to a better compromise between safety and convenience before I would consider getting one of these again."
103560,2,I purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so. I have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units. The sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem. Weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that.I would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them.
23167,1,"I like this product a lot, but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process... the product vibrates great, the colors are attractive to her, and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab. However, its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment. Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better. But overall I really like it."
123916,0,"I loved the idea of this product, but, it was not all that helpful. it was hard to get the tee pee on. keeping it on never happened either, again, very cute though. I would get the little bag to wash them in if I was buying it again."
130649,2,This swing is not worth the money. It is quiet and I like what it does but.... my baby is only 7 weeks old and we got it 1 month ago when she was 3 weeks and we are on the 3rd set of batteries already. The music quit working after 1 week. And the mobile works only when it wants to. We had a fisher price cradle swing bought at toys-r-us for our boys. With our first child I only had to change the battries 2 times in a year. Yes I used it for him when he was 14 months old it worked great. But this swing I was not happy with at all. But the swing does still swing. But it eats battries like there is no tomorrow.
106738,1,"We got a diaper champ with our first child (now 2.5) just by fluke. We didn't know what kind of pail to get and this one just ended up being what we received. It was an absolute WONDERFUL diaper pail.I'll admit, over time it became less effective at blocking odor. Best I can tell (I'm no designer) there is a foam layer that blocks odors from escaping - over time that foam apparently breaks down. But thats just life - nothing is guaranteed to last forever! Anyhow - when ours stopped trapping odors (after 1.5 years of use) we decided to simply purchase a new pail.Our local store only sold the Diaper Genie so we figured we'd give it a try. HORRIBLE mistake. It was a nuisance to use and expensive to purchase the special bags. By now we were using size 3 or 4 diapers and they had to be ""smooshed"" into such a small size to fit in the genie, I actually ended up getting baby 'mess' on myself and the genie more than once. After about 2 weeks of messing with that stupid contraption I returned it to Wal-Mart (no questions asked, thankfully) and promptly started a search for, and purchased, a new diaper champ.We're expecting twins next week, and so I registered at Babies R Us for TWO diaper champs - and luckily received them both as gifts!! Will they need replacing after a year or so? Probably - but the money saved by not buying special trash bags will more than pay for a whole new pail when the time comes, and in the meantime, the convenience of a diaper pail that works, and works simply, is more than I can ask for."
35734,1,Bought this for someone's registry but wish I had one myself for my baby - it is so warm and cuddly. I have the bugaboo so use the footmuff for the same purpose.
150978,0,"I got this armoire for significantly less on ebay, it was easy to put together (I did it by myself in an hour or so at 6 months pregnant) and none of the pieces were damaged. However I'm not sure what Storkcraft considers ""hard wood"", the armoire scratched very easily (you could scratch the wood with your fingernail) when I put it together. Otherwise it is a very nice piece of furniture, I would not have thought it worth the $300-$400 price range some websites have it listed at because the wood is so soft (it seems to be pine). I did end up taking out one of the shelves and installing a clothes rod, and adding a few hooks inside the doors for extra storage."
7131,1,"Great price on diapers and delivered so incredibly fast! I've ordered our diapers twice from Amazon and both times, I received them the next day! Top that off with free delivery, and you just can't beat it!"
170084,0,"Not a bad crib in general, but my major complaint is in putting it together. Every bolt and screw has a hex head. This is such a pain and only using the included hex wrench is a pain. Do yourself a favor and buy a hex set from your hardware store, it will be a little easier. I don't know why they wouldn't just make them with a phillips head. After some frustration, it went together and feels solid."
96871,1,"We love the Sleep Sheep! White noise helped my older child fall asleep, but it was annoying lugging around a fan or air purifier with us. When my second was born, someone gave us the Sleep Sheep and it was the perfect solution - soft, portable, loud enough, with lots of soothing sounds. I also like how it attached to a carseat or crib or bouncy seat.My one complaint is that it has a timer for automatic shut off at 25 or 45 minutes, but there;s no option for it to just stay on - my daughter still sometimes wakes up when sleep sheep turns off and we have to sneak into her room to turn it back on again so she'll go back to sleep. I would give this product 1,000 stars if it would stay on all night!"
148858,1,"Don't let the seam reviews stop you from buying this pillow. I bought this for my wife and she loves it! She had this to say about it. &#34;I'm 22 weeks pregnant and have had a hard time sleeping through the night for the last month. My husband bought this for my for Christmas but decided to give it to me early after a particularly long night. This pillow is great. It fits my body nearly perfect and has allowed me to get comfortable. Which has translated into more rest and sleeping through the night again! (for now).&#34;&#34;I noticed the seam at first but it has not bothered me at all. I sleep on my side with the open end of the pillow at my feet. I have just the basic cover on it and really have not had any problem with the seam.&#34;&#34;Don't let the seam reviews scare you away from buy it, if you need a good body pillow this is a good one!&#34;"
173836,0,"I would recommend this swing, but be aware what you might be getting yourself in for. First off, my son loves this swing. It is the only thing he'll sleep in. And even though the animals on the mobile face out so that he sees only their feet, he seems to like the mobile. He also likes looking at himself in the mirror. Well, like many other reviewers, the mobile and music quit working within a matter of weeks of owning this swing. I was very upset, as the only way I get to take a shower is to put my son in his swing and turn on the mobile and the music. We bought a crib music/motion toy and attached it to the cloth pocket that hangs between the swing legs. It's nice and he likes it, but it is not the same. My electrician husband has looked at the inner workings of the swing and said it is a piece of junk and not worth anywhere near the price of the swing. But, my son loves it and will sleep in nothing else, so what do you do? We are going to try contacting Fisher-Price and requesting a replacement motor. If that doesn't work, back to the store the swing goes.As far as the loud ratcheting sound some have complained of, I found that if you separate the legs as FAR apart as they will go, this will take care of that horrible ratcheting sound.I have had no problems with the swing slowing down as my son got bigger. For reference, my son is 10 weeks old and 14lbs. As of now, the swing is still swinging away; just no mobile or music.So, buy this swing if you need something motion-based for your child to sleep in, just be prepared to call Fisher-Price for a replacement motor when the mobile and music stops working, and know that you are shelling out MUCH more money than this swing is worth. Oh, and keep the box and the receipt...you'll need them to take the swing back to the store for an exchange."
44925,1,"I love this pump! I did get mine on ebay...and bought all new shields, collection containers, and tubes, and also disinfected the entire pump when it arrived. I got it almost $100 cheaper that way! It is a wonderful pump and I cannot imagine being a breastfeeding mother without it...even if I were staying home! It's so quick and efficient and no hand pump is going to match that! It has a battery pack and I also have the car adapter so that I can pump wherever we are! It has a nice appearance so that it doesn't scream ""BREAST PUMP!"" I suggest ANYONE who is going to breastfeed their child...get this pump! You will not be sorry that you spent the money!"
50627,1,"I am always been a stomach sleeper, so pregnancy sleep was an even bigger struggle than normal. I bought this pillow early on and couldn't sleep without it. My belly rested very nicely on the pillow and placing the rest of the pillow between my legs helped position my body more comfortably. My husband didn't love how much space it took up in the bed, though he would try to steal it on occasion. Near the end of the pregnancy, it became harder to get in and out of bed with the pillow in the way, but I just kept the open side facing out, which made it a little easier. I also found it comfortable to use either side as the pillow, so could easily switch from my right to left side while sleeping without (always) waking up. Definitely recommend this pillow!"
177290,1,I bought this hoping that my boys would sleep in their bed and now they do. It is very soft just like our bed. I would not recommend it for a newborn though.
102353,1,This Mobile is great! My son absolutely loves watching it rotate and the leaves going up and down! I definitely recommend!
29883,0,I was unable to find additional bottles for this product. The pump is not sturdy I don't think it will last a year.
109276,1,I started using this when my daughter was 6 months old. I put bananas and other pieces of fruit in it and she loved it. The only problem is is that it is really hard to clean. The pieces of fruit get stuck in the mesh very easily.
34313,1,"My granddaughters love this stroller,of course I had to purchase it on line ELSEWHEREbecause Amazon.com FAILED in every way to get itto me...they totally botched the sale and deliveryto me in every way possible and customer servicerepeatedly asked if I was satisfied and I wouldtell them that I was very unhappy and they nevereven tried to fix or correct the problem and justkept asking me id I was happy with the service andas they are doing now asking me to write a reviewon the stroller that I never received!!! They donteven have a CLUE...and have lost one of their best customers...!!!"
42386,0,"overall I like it. It is taking lots of practice to get the wrap to the right tightness and security for me and the baby. He has fallen asleep in it a couple of times, but as a paranoid mother I am constantly worried that he will overheat or stop breathing. So I don't keep him in it for long. I think it will come in handy when we travel in the airport."
16659,2,"Ihave a 4 month old baby who weighs 18 lbs. and is 27 1/2 inches long. He has outgrown the Graco car seat I had for him, and I am not ready to give up the ""bucket"", since I am constantly hefting him around while I take my 4 year old daughter to school, dance, etc. etc. etc.I bought this system because the KeyFit carseat can carry a child up to 30"", and I needed a new stroller anyway since our old one was smushed by the garage door coming down (no child in it, luckily). The only other car seat for tall babies is the Graco SafeSeat, which I also bought, for comparison purposes.The car seat is very nice, a bit heavier than the Graco SafeSeat. The Chicco car seat can carry a baby up to 22lbs. and 30"", the Graco can carry one up to 30 lbs. and 30"", although I don't know how you can carry a kid in that seat once he weighs 30 lbs.The stroller is great - it has nice height adjustable handles, a parent console, a kid snack tray, big basket, looks cute (no plaid here!) and nicely padded. It also steers very nicely. The major drawback is that the top of the seat back tips up when you recline the seat, I suppose to make a nice enclosed place for an infant to rest, but it only gives you 14"" from the bottom of the seat back to where it tips up. My son's head (he is only 4 months) was right up against that part, so I don't think he will be able to fit in there for very long.I put my 4 year old daughter in it and she was really, really uncomfortable, even when the seat was upright. She looked like Alice in wonderland, spilling over the sides of the stroller.Since maybe its not fair to judge a stroller based on a 4 year old in it, I borrowed my friend's 2 year old daughter who is very petite, and even she looked to be at full capacity. When the seat was fully reclined, he head rested on the top of the lip and she said it hurt - not a good way to have a child take a nap. Even partially reclined, the seat back starts to tip. I am going to return the stroller, because of this.I ended up buying the Zippy Ingelsina stoller and keeping the Graco car seat, and I think it will be a much better fit for my baby as he continues to grow."
75893,0,"this was purchased for a upscale dog bed to match my sheepskin rugs, and it is much more yellow, and not as plush. disappointed, but happy with amazon and their options.i kept the item, but ordered a replacement anyway.it was my error, not theirs. the animals seem to like it, and they don't notice the color anyway~"
101929,1,"I bought this for my 5 1/2 month old when she started cutting her first tooth a few weeks ago. This is her favorite teether, next to her avent teether ring. She loves to chew on it and touch it and it is alot easier to chew on in my opinion than the traditional teething rings, I also think its easier for babies to hold since there are so many spikes to grip on the ball. The spikes sort of remind me of pacifiers that are meant for babies to chew on. Overall great product, one bad thing would be that you cant thoroughly clean it. I used a alcohol swab to sanitize it and wiped it down with a wet cloth and let it air dry before giving it to my baby for the first time just to make sure it was clean."
79106,2,"As the other reviewer stated, the seal appears to be faulty on this, and it stopped working almost straight away. I have seen many other bad reviews of this product as well."
57119,1,"This Easy Close Supergate works great. I did not have a need for the included extensions in my bedroom doorway. Installation was a breeze. I use it constantly every day to keep dogs both in and out of my room. The best feature is the automatic closure. I walk in the room with my hands full and to have the gate swing closed behind me is prefect. It does make minimal metal on metal sound when closing but it's nothing annoying. At night, I close it with my hand to prevent noise from waking the room mate and I've never had any complaints from her. I don't use the lock function so I cannot comment but it seems very easy to use, just a twist and its locked."
59122,0,This is a good warmer and works great with Avent bottles. The only problem with this warmer is it doesn't have an on/off switch or auto shut off. For the price that feature should have been standard.
130430,1,My mother in law bought me this swing because my baby was very fussy everyday and he fights to go to sleep sometimes. This swing rocks him to sleep right away. It is perfect for daytime naps and gives me a chance to get things done around the house while he is safely sleeping. He loves the water sounds. It relaxes him right away! I highly recommend this swing. It is very cute and I know the color changing lights and mobile are going to be very entertaining when he gets a little older.
31880,1,"Great for the price. I have the Bolero, which is the stripped down version of the Generations seat. Because the top slats for the harness are higher than most seats, this is great for a taller child or a child with a long torso. A child outgrows their harness when their shoulders are above where the straps come out of the back of the seat, so with higher slats this will keep your child harnessed (safer!) longer. My 4 year old loves the cup holder, it's a little flimsy but we never spill... she just likes having something to put in it. The harness is easy to buckle and has adjusters on the side to make every trip a perfect fit. This seat grows with your child and turns into a belt positioning booster when she outgrows the harness. Has more side impact protection than some similar seats, although if you use the pillow (which is really pointless) your child's head will still droop forward.The only thing I do not like about this seat is that the harness is only usable to 40 lbs, while some seats (like Britax) can keep your child harnessed longer. Since a harness is safer for EVERYONE that is something of a drawback, but it's still a good seat for a lower weight child, a low income budget, or a back-up seat."
8618,1,"I bought a green cooshie booster about 3 years ago when my daughter was about 1 1/2 and no longer wanted the high chair. It gave her just the right height for sitting at the adult table. Then I purchased a blue one about 1 year ago for my son when he was just past 1 year old. They both worked great and the best is that 3 years later the green one still looks like new, as is the blue one 1 year later. My daughter is now 4 1/2 and still sits in it every day - and the blue one still works great for my son who is now 2. Even the tote bags are still sturdy for when we take take the boosters to grandma's house. They are very easy to keep clean and light enough for the kids to carry.We changed our table and chairs recently and the boosters work well with our new wooden chairs. Great product and I highly recommend purchasing these. No longer just a fad item, cooshie boosters now in my list of toddler necessities, and I've added them to my list of Good Gifts for Toddlers!"
83608,2,"I bought this rail 2 weeks ago for one of my two year old twin boys. After finally getting it put together, I had quite a bit of trouble figuring out exactly how it fit onto the bed. About a half hour later I positioned it onto the mattress, and pushed down on the rail till it ""locked"" into position. This worked fine for about 3 days, until the pressure from the rail caused the mattress to indent. After each passing day, the mattress grooved in more, and I had to apply more pressure to the rail to keep it ""locked"" in place. Needless to say, this rail went back to the store because I didn't want to ruin my mattress... Unless I terribly misunderstood the directions, this rail is not worth the time or money!!!"
33906,0,"I also own the Medela Pump-in-Style, and wanted a smaller, quieter, more portable pump to travel with. The Harmony pump worked great - the let-down feature is especially helpful for me. Often I found that the Harmony expressed more milk than the electric pump. However, after just 3 months of ""occasional"" use, the pump suddenly stopped working. The part that connects the handle to the rest of the pump has become loose, and there is very little suction now. I tried going to the Medela website to get a customer service number to call, but could only find email contact info. The price isn't bad, so I suppose I can just get a new one, but I would have liked to use the pump for longer than 3 months..."
32284,0,"This pink cover truly is beautiful and very soft. But the fabric is too thin. I received a hand-me-down animal-printed Boppy Pillow and wanted to make it match my little girl's room. This certainly matches, but you can still see the animal print through the cover. I'm going to keep it, but I sure wish it didn't look so tacky!If you plan to use this cover, make sure you have a solid white Boppy pillow underneath."
75158,1,This is the cutest little gift. I sent this to a friend that is a Military Wife. She loved the Camo!
130152,1,"Our baby LOVES this swing. I originally bought it for my sister's baby, but we loved it so much we got one for our baby. All the features are great and having both the standard swing and cradle swing are great. The only problem is that I spend all day at work with the music stuck in my head!"
141512,2,"I purchased this walker for my son and it never worked right from the beginning. The sound on it was really muffled and he couldn't hear it. Within 2 weeks the toys on it quit working altogether. My sister-in-law also bought this walker and she did not have the same sound problem with hers, so I thought maybe I just got a bad one. However after a month or so all of her toys also quit playing sound! New batteries did not help. My son did have a lot of fun pushing it around, but I could have bought a cheaper one if that was all that it was going to be good for."
6653,1,"I'm not the type to be loyal to a particular brand but must say that Pampers Cruisers are the ONLY diapers I will buy for my son and any future kids I have. I've used other brands and they haven't even come close. The other Pampers diaper (Baby Dri), both lines of Huggies, Luvs and the Walmart brand simply don't absorb the way these do. My one complaint is that the weight listed on the box has never applied to my son--he's always needed a size larger than the box says he should need."
16944,0,a bit of a production to use when you always have to put it together.I can imagine it's fine for a home bed that doesn't require moving it.
116191,1,Perfect for every parent whose ever tried to feed a toddler at a fast food restaurant. No more wrapping paper or trays used as food-filled catapults. The Table Topper allows baby to eat off the table without the food actually touching the table. These thin plastic sheets store easily in a diaper bag and adhere right to the table top. When you're done just peel off and throw out the mess.
73890,1,"This was the best baby gift I received! Starting from the first day in the hospital I was able to learn our baby's routine! My baby is now four weeks old and I still walk around with the itzbeen. I've learned that she is on a three hour schedule. So when I've ""zeroed"" all the buttons I can go out for errands with her and have confidence that she will be set. I attach it to her crib at night and use it as a nightlight. It is the perfect brightness. I can see everything but it isn't enough to disturb her if she isn't really awake yet. The slide button for nursing is a life saver in the middle of the night when I can barely remember my name let alone the last side I nursed on. I'll be buying this for all my pregnant friends in the future!"
5457,1,It's bigger than I thought (that's what she said) and it's keeping my car clean from my husband's bad habits of stuffing receipts and bags in the car door slots. Although the only problem is without trash in it the Velcro on the bottom doesn't stick very well to the car floor but on the whole it's very helpful.
33215,1,"FYI - Only gates manufactured prior to September 2001 were recalled due to faulty hinge mechanisms. There have been no recalls on this model of Evenflo gates since then. I've only owned this gate for a short time, but so far I love it. It's extremely sturdy, well-made and looks beautiful!"
123187,0,"Overall, it's great, lots of room, fun toys, BUT...How the heck are you supposed to wash it? The person who designed this obviously does NOT have babies or they would have known to make it easy to clean. You can't take off the nasty pad cover and wash it b/c there is no zipper or velcro or anything, it's sewn on there good. I had slice it down the middle on the back and glue velcro to it, just so I can wash it. I don't feed my baby or give him anything that can spill in there b/c it's just too hard to clean. Also I've had to replace the foam mat b/c it does get dirty. Also the railing is hard to clean. Babies chew and put their mouths all over the edges when they can and the only way I've found to clean it is with soap and sponges and even then it doesn't clean well. I would have rated this better if the bottom mat was washable, I am NOT going to buy a replacement pad for this b/c it was expensive enough all ready!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!"
69841,1,"These diapers are just as good as Pampers. In fact, I think both Pampers and Luvs are made by P&G, so they are probably made in the same factories! The price is great."
2622,0,"This is the 3rd different package of Pampers diapers (size 5 twice and now size 6) the diapers opens and causes a mess of white fluffy material spread on my baby's body and of the floor. Difficult to clean, but no rash (I have seen some other reviewers mentioning rash on their babies).This did not happen previously when I used Pampers to my other 2 boys (9-11 years ago), so I think it has to do the factory and the diapers now are not sealed right."
13767,2,"This is an attractive cover, but oddly, it's way too hard to get on the pad it's designed for. The first time it was difficult to put on, but looked ok. After repeated washings, it's getting worse and is bending my changing pad. the ends are all smushed down. What a bummer."
47219,1,"We have five children from nine years down to one. We purchased this product because of it's ease of use and ultralight weight. Any one of our children can ride in the rear seat making it an enjoyable experience where ever we go. The front seat allows our one year old to sit high, making him feel like he is always part of the group. The basket has been great at holding anything we need. I especially loved the hidden feature on the upper part of the bar. The wide black band that goes across the top is actually storage compartment with two drink holders, a zipper compartment for small things like hotel keys or cell phones, and the center of the band can hold a wallet that is well tucked and hidden. I was pleasantly surprised by this stroller. Strangers have approached me asking and I tell them great things. We ordered the ""Sunset."" My only worry is that we won't be able to keep it clean, although, cookie messes have wiped right off so far."
62861,2,"This is a fine product. But it's also a silly one. Once upon a time, the Diaper Genie's approach was the best idea out there -- a better mousetrap, no question. But the Diaper Champ is simply a better design...because it's simpler.The basics have been brought in several reviews here: diapers stink, you can't change that. These devices are just ways to store and eventually throw them out with minimal odor. Both devices do a decent job of that. But the Diaper Genie requires expensive, proprietary refills to do so.Simple is better. Get a Diaper Champ: any bag works & the flip-lever design is really really easy to use."
120812,1,"I bought this gate only to keep our dogs out of the hallway that leads to the bedrooms. There are sort of 3 levels of security you can achieve with this gate. For me, I wanted my 2 year of to be able to use it easily so I taped the bottom peg so it won't catch. That way he only had to deal w sliding the top lever open. Now, we've had it for so long that my dogs just trust that they're not coming through, so i recently taped the top peg too. It's just a free swinging gate. I can always take the tape off & make access more difficult if i need to."
78912,1,"Here's the situation:Family of 6 (with 16-month old twins). Moving with the military from Hawaii to the Midwest. 12 checked bags, and 8 carry-on bags. I promise you, these straps made all the difference. Our concerns went from ""how can we manage this"", to, ""all we have to do is make it from the curb to the departure gate.""Our car seats (Britax Marathon) are, by far, the largest and heaviest carseats that I have every seen, but the straps held up fantastically.It was a bit of a hassle having to disconnect the straps to get through the screening station, but we were well practiced by the time that event came up. My husband unhooked everything, and I waited on the other side of the detector machines for the items to come out. Re-connecting the seats was a breeze, and we were on our way."
83804,1,"My son is going on 2 and has several allergies with this place mat I have no fear about what has been left on the table before us!! I know no matter how much of a mess he makes it is on his own personal mat...he can eat on it, he can make a mess on it with out any problems. It fits very easily in the diaper bag and cleans up in a snap!!! NO more fears about yucky germs either...I know it is clean because I cleaned it!!! A must have for any mother with a child of vertually any age."
9834,1,"I purchased this potty chair for my 2 year old daughter. It arrived today, upon opening the box and setting the potty on the floor, my daughter was so excited she sat down and went potty in it within just a few minutes. She loves it. Arrived in excelent condition and is very sturdy. My daughter has no problems getting on and off of it by herself without the risk of it tipping over. The removable bowl is great, it's so easy to clean. She loves to just sit on it. Excelent product and I would recomend it to everyone who has a little one getting ready for the next step in becoming a big boy/girl."
176457,2,"After using the Medela Symphony pump, I was fairly disappointed with this one. It's super slow and very loud, I can't get much milk pumped out with it. If I had known better, I would have bought the Swing pump instead... I imagine that a hand-held pump might be better than this one too. I should've done better research before buying this."
170812,1,"Fits our pack n play extra mattress that we bought, a little snug and buckles but once baby sleeps on it once after washing it conforms perfectly. Love the color but it has faded just after a few washes."
45380,1,"The product is well made. The product seems fun. Most of the toys something special about them.The elephant has a pull cord that makes it vibrate.The monkey is a rattle.The parrot's wings are made of crinkle paper. (Makes noise when you fold/grab it.)The rattle is just a rattleThe giraffe is also a rattle.Also, about safety:The elephant no longer has the plastic bottom people complained about.Also, the mirror is not glass.There are various things to grab on the floor mat. And if you push on hidden buttons near the flower, music starts. (This can be turned off.)Nothing obviously bad about the product to me."
160499,1,"this product is wonderful, especially for little boys. My son went through 3 potty seats/toliets before we got this one. the lip on the front is great for little boys. we found a lot of potty seats/toliets are not ment for little boys. but this one is perfect."
100437,1,These diapers are very good. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the tabs that easily breaks.
38260,2,"I was very dissapointed in this product and returned it. It is flimsy and if a decently sized child ever actually got ahold of it while it was attached it would probably break right off. The stuffed toys were all slightly ""off"" looking and were not of a very good quality, and if I had screwed the attachment on firm enough to actually keep it upright it would have chewed the finish right off the crib (as it is it left a mark I had to paint over). If you HAVE to have your team, it's really the only thing out there on the market, be prepared it is NOT worth it unless you are die hard and don't care about the quality."
64938,0,"We used to be big fans of Chicco products for our son, not any more. This product is OK, we had problems using it to begin with.It wont easily fold and we live in an apartment building. I called the chicco customer service for help, left a message and waited and waited and waited. E-mailed and to my surprise, the so called ""customer-service"" manager made it look like they had donated this product to me and were done with it. Really i was flabbergasted at her response. I have had same ( though no so extereme) responses from Chicco customer service in the past as well. So folks, be cautioned once you get that product out of the store, dont expect any help or even any response from Chicco if you come across come problems. You are on your own and THEY SIMPLY DON'T CARE."
120244,0,"I agree with some of the other users, you can find a cheaper solution. However, the wipes do not smell and work well in getting everything clean. I travel and am running around trying to keep up my milk supply so this works for everything that I need."
111473,1,"I ordered these for my 45 lb. dog. They were a tight fit so I don't believe the weight limits on the package are correct. I would order an XL, instead. Otherwise, they're pretty easy to use (even with a wiggly dog) and don't come off terribly easily."
164331,2,"We have been using Pampers Cruisers, I got these by mistake. These are not anywhere near as good as the Cruisers."
139562,1,"My two under-five grandchildren have gone nut-so over the Twilight Turtle, fighting over who's gonna have it in their bedroom at night. It has been most beneficial for my four year old grandaughter who doesn't like to go to sleep in the dark."
65490,1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE the cosleeper. After a c-section it made access to my daughter easy,and was great for nursing. At 5 months we are still using it. I also bought the crib tent to keep our cats out. Invaluable."
182659,2,"The only place I can safely sit my son in my car is in the center of the backseat; unfortunately, there is no headrest there. I bought this mirror because it was the only one in the store that offered ""multiple attachments."" Well, the illustrated instructions were not helpful at all so I had to get creative and rig it up somehow. It is now poorly attached (a potential safety hazard) to the backseat and it will not stay at the angle that I need it to be in order to see my son."
172711,1,"I found it was not great with my son lying down in it. The little thing he laid down on left a red mark on his back, and there was no room left for the shower attachment which does actually work and is quite cute. However, I think once he can sit up, this tub will be perfectly sized, so I have saved it for a few months and am still using the newborn tub I had until then."
108867,2,"We received this activity tray as a gift and thought it would be great. We have found it to be of little value. The phone receiver is so short that my son can barely pick it off the tray. You can't hold it up to mimic talking on the phone. The four buttons at the top push down but that's it. No squeak, no buzz, nothing to make my son want to play with it. Same goes for some of the other &quot;activities&quot;. I called Peg Perego to complain about the design and they told me there was nothing they could do to help me. Save your money."
14609,0,"The Avent bottles were recommended to me by my cousin. She did warn me about the leaking problem with these bottles. Even when I think I have the cap on correctly, the formula leaks out of the bottle soaking my daughter. Several times, while in my bottle bag, the formula has seeped out leaving me with an empty bottle and a pool of formula in my bag.......very frustrating and messy!!! On a happier note, I am also currently using the microwave sterilizer and bottle warmer put out by Avent and I'm quite satisfied with both products."
142603,0,"After having my third c-section baby in three years, I tried this pillow (in a different fabric) - but didn't get it until my infant was three months old. I like the pocket on the side of it - that's great; however, I found overall it was a little too bulky for my taste. Because I work from home, I'm often sitting in an office chair when I nurse and this pillow was much too bulky for that. On the sofa, and in the bed - I think this pillow would be great. When I was at the computer, I used my Boppy (which I've had since my first was a newborn). Had I never tried a Boppy, I think I would've really liked this pillow. I also think this pillow would be wonderful for c-section moms -- anything to keep the baby off that incision!"
178078,2,"I really didnt like it. I think it is way too thin and the material quality its poor. The graphics are nice, tough. Ok if you plan to change the mat every week or so."
51550,1,"Our baby was not a very good sleeper as a newborn. In fact, at first she did not sleep at all. It was frustrating, and I know my baby is not the only non-sleeper out there. We LOVED our kiddopotamus swaddler. Even us newbie parents did not have a tough time figuring it out, and if our daughter was crying, the swaddler comforted her in no time. The best part was: she slept!"
152074,2,"What a pain to put up! Why would they split the poster in half and then fold to ship? It would have been worth my $20 if it came in as one piece and rolled in a tube.Our mural came in a terrible, terrible state, to the point where we almost ditched it. It took a lot of patience to undo the creases (zig zag creases from top to bottom not from folding). Lining up on the wall was impossible; bottom half of poster was too wide. We had it sliced to get it to fit correctly. It didn't stick for a week and finally we found it on the floor, stuck together. It took two people to pull apart and as last resort, we used wall paper glue. Hope this is it!All in all, the happiness it brought to our 18 month old son's face was worth all the hassle."
135390,1,"I have been through a few monitors over the last 10 years. This one works well, but one unit has a slight hum to it, which may just be my house. I would rec this monitor to a friend."
72837,0,This was good the first few weeks we had it up but then it grew very weak and was unable to support toys. Colors also faded very quickly... was good while it worked but wouldnt purchase again.
151884,1,"I'd been worried for a while about how to keep our toddler out of the folding closet doors in her room. I read about some not-so-good locks online, but I decided to try these based on the positive reviews. Never would I have thought a small piece of plastic would work so well, but it does! I bought four of these locks to keep our two, 2-door closets secured. They slide easily for adult access, but our daughter cannot get to anything in the closet. Great product!"
54477,1,"I purchased this mobile because of the music and the colorful design. I was a little hesitant at first because I didn't want to dish out the money for a product my daughter would only use for five months. Now I am glad I made this purchase. It is the one baby item I have not returned. Although my 2 week old has a difficult time focusing on the colorful animals, she loves the music. It seems to calm her down when she is getting cranky. I had a little problem with the way the mobile was rotating and instead of exchanging the mobile, I called the company and was completely suprised at how quick they were to please me as a customer. Without any questions, they sent me a new part with the animals. They have a lifetime guarantee on all their products. Now, most of her developmental toys are made by them. This mobile is worth every penny."
61448,1,I use this to monitor my elderly sister - if she needs help at night all she needs to do is call my name...I can also hear her breathing (if it is regular or distressed)
72734,1,"This powder smells way better in my opinion than regular talcum baby powder, its long lasting as well. Id recommend it to anyone!"
3882,1,"Our 10-month-old daughter has guided us in thoroughly baby-proofing the house, but until we purchased these we could not figure out what to do with the plants short of removing them all together. Several large palm trees provided all kinds of fun for her as daily she would remove the rocks that lie over the dirt and then dig in, spilling and trying to eat the dirt underneath. Other smaller plants were the same except that with her growing strength she could pull them all the way over, providing plenty of dirt and rocks to play with all over the carpet!These simple nets proved to be exactly what we needed. Installing them on the larger pots was a bit tricky even with two people, and best done when the pot is really dry. We were impressed at how large they stretched, and how well the tops rebounded. My only complaint is that they are not at all tight around the stalks of the plants so they definitely need securing with safety pins or stitching, which I think should be included along with some quick instructions. They do also make watering a bit trickier as some of the water tends to run off the mesh, especially if it is poured too fast. But other than that they are wonderful, very strong when tugged on by little hands, and so far keep in all rocks and dirt if plants are tipped over.Though we were able to cut them up a little more than the packages specify, I would recommend purchasing the proper sizes and following the guidelines for using the larges as one, mediums as two, etc. and not trying to get too cheap and just chop up the bigger ones. They work best if they cover the entire container on glazed ceramic pots, and at least 2/3 of the way down on terracotta: the rough surface kind of grabs and holds them in place, allowing them to be shorter and still work. Overall we are so happy we found these, they have permitted us to end the redecorating aka baby-proofing the house without removing one of our favorite features. My husband even thinks the plants are kind of 'sexy' now too, since they basically are all wearing black fishnets :-)"
72092,1,"I bought this as a gift for my friend. The only negative is that it says that it is a bank and I thought that meant the Pikachu itself was the bank with a little slot on top. However, this is not the case. You can only put a tiny amount of change in it because the slot is on the base of the bank. The Pikachu is just TOO CUTE."
8762,0,"Between the two of us my sister and I have purchased 4 of these. We both have wood chairs and haven't had any problems with the finish. However, the material seems to dry out a bit and eventually the sides will fall off in large chunks (happened with all of ours). They're still functional but not real attractive. They are definitely the most comfortable boosters for the kids we have found. Not very durable, however the missing sides don't seem to bother the kids any."
151386,1,"There is nothing spectacular about this product; however, it does exactly what it's supposed to do, and that's saying a lot considering that most products today don't live up to their claims."
159804,0,"This item was received as a baby shower gift and by the time my son was 3 months old, the seat pad had started to fade. We had used the bouncer a total of two months and only washed it one time. I was very disappointed to see this product wear so quickly. My mom has a bouncer from Summer Infant that is excellent. Three boys and 10+ years later and her bouncer looks brand new!I called Fisher-Price this morning and they are willing to send a replacement pad. I will update this review at a later time to comment on the length of time it took to receive the replacement materials. Overall concept is wonderful, but durability was a disappointment.In addendum to the above, Fisher-Price wasted no time sending me the replacement pad. The replacement was delivered in a matter of days. Customer service was on the ball!"
37054,0,"We bought this booster for my 2 1/2 yr old because we wanted to give his Britax carseat to our newborn. We did so much research to ensure we were buying a safe, comfortable booster for my son that he could grow into over the next several yrs. Any roadtrip over an hour, our son begins to get uncomfortable &amp; complains of the neckstraps digging into his neck. His head bobs forward when he falls asleep and usually wakes up crying because he is so twisted in the seat. My son is 40&quot; tall and 38 lbs, quite large for a 2 1/2 yr old and he still &quot;swims&quot; in this booster. Because of the design, his knees are higher than his waist, and that seems to cause discomfort too. His legs cannot hang down over the seat (&amp; he is very tall for his age!) and it causes them to be scruntched behind my driver seat. I drive a Volvo wagon w/ plenty of room in the backseat - this should not be an issue and it is. On top of that, the manufacturer's instructions indicate that based on our sons size, he is ready for the regular seatbelt instead of the 5 point harness. This is even more uncomfortable for him &amp; doesn't seem to restrain him properly. Overall, we're very disappointed in its comfortability. I really wish we could use the Britax again. THAT is the best carseat ever made!"
68615,1,"I really like this product line. It wears well under make-up-- I use a light face powder.Be aware that you need to rub-in fairly well as the titanium dioxide makes this white (like good sunblocks should).I have naturally dry skin so this isn't too oily or greasy for me. It doesn't feel heavy at all.I've also used the SPF 30, which does have a heavier texture and feel, but for hot/bright summer months it is worth avoiding the risks of skin cancer!"
94258,1,"We loved Avent bottles for our daughter who is now 2. The leaking drove me nuts until i realized you can prevent it just by wiping down the rim of the bottle before you screw on the nipple. i think that if a little water gets in there, it makes an air pocket so milk leaks through. just wiping them down to make sure they are dry and of course screwing on the nipple cap tightly will prevent leaking. these bottles are terrific."
145293,1,"I bought this jumper for my grandson when he was 4 1/2 months old b/c his dad loved the doorway model when he was a baby. After a short learning curve for the jumping aspect of the toy, he absolutely loves it!!! He likes the toys that are attached- I wasn't sure about the firefly b/c it just hangs over the side, but he goes for Flora Firefly every time he's in the Jumparoo. He will jump and jump to keep the music playing (you can set the music to play when he jumps or all the time or not at all) and is absolutely thrilled with the results as evidenced by the ear-splitting grin on his face. This is definitely a must-buy. I move it from room to room while I clean up or cook dinner or even eat lunch (yes, you can even have a hot meal courtesy of the Jumparoo!). We have the Rainforest mobile and he likes to see his Rainforest Friends here as well. The only drawback to the Jumparoo is the height adjustment. Even at the number 1 setting, we have to place a small pillow or folded blanket underneath in order for his toes to touch the floor as recommended because he's not the tallest monkey on the percentile charts. But I would definitely recommend getting this toy for your baby-they can just sit in the Jumparoo and watch the world or have some great jumping time to exercise those leg muscles that they'll soon be using to run around the jungle-5 Stars in my book!"
88064,1,"I haven't had a chance to hang these up yet, but I'll assume they'll look just as cute as the picture. All coordinates to the bedding seemed reasonably priced. So I bought everything that matched. Before getting on Amazon, I couldn't find any nursery stuff with dragonflies on it."
203,2,"So I bought these diapers because I have used the Swaddlers before with success. My daughter is 9 weeks old, 10 pounds and uses size 1. For anyone that has not used Swaddlers, the difference between the two is clearly the quality as the diaper is much thinner, almost paper thin. Upon the first use of this diaper, I noticed that after a 2 hour nap, my daughter's onesie was was wet. I gave the diaper another chance, and had exactly the same issue. I would not recommend this diaper as I believe the whole purpose of a diaper is to keep the baby dry."
63656,1,"I purchased this shopping cart cover after looking through many different ones. I was going to buy the one that had the toys on it but the reviews said that it didn't stay on the cart very well. So I went with this one and I am very happy with that choice. It has loops that you can attach toys to. Also it has two side pockets on the inside. It covers all of the areas in the cart that the baby would be able to touch. I can easily put it in a cart and hold my 6 month old daughter at the same time. The pattern is for girls or boys and I plan to keep it around for the next baby. The only thing is that the belt that comes with it is loose so you have to be careful not to loose it. I always snap it back on to the piece when I take it off of the cart. Thanks to a previous review that I read for the heads up. : It also washes up nicely in the washing machine. Whenever I go out she is the only baby around with a shopping cart cover. I just feel like she is more comfortable with having it instead of being in a bare cart, not to mention GERMS!"
162402,0,"This was given to me as a shower gift. It got lost under mountains of baby stuff, but I eventually found it while trying to pack for baby first trip. Since then, its been a staple in her diaper bag. I like that it has its own zip up case, so things don't get lost. I wouldn't recommend if for everday use b/c of some of the same complaints as other reviewers (medicine stopper, awkward thermometer). But I have had to use it on occassion while my baby and I were away from home and our everyday supplies and it really came in handy."
174226,1,"my daughter who is now 2 months, has this swing and she is so content in it, and i never been happier, she actually sits in this swing while i clean my house .. and i dont hear a sound from her. i had got another swing, just a regualar swing and she would cry everytime i put her in it. I recommend this swing for anyone who has a fussy baby (like mine)"
139553,1,"We have the Twilight Turtle and we bought this one as a present for our friend. I like this one even better than the Turtle since it has the on/off button not just the switch. Plus it has an additional moon shape that the Turtle does not have. We love the Turtle in our house and turn it on every night. But, this one is a perfect gift too."
58411,0,"I gave this product 3 stars because it does its job, but isn't necessary. When you first get the bottles and pacifiers, boil them. After that (my pediatrician agrees) just pop them in the dishwasher. Save the extra step. This, the bottle warmer and wipe warmer were a waste of money. I will defidently smarten up for the next one. Save your time and money."
16702,1,"These are great cups despite what the other reviewers have stated. We use it for water only, and she has a separate straw cup (Playtex) for her milk. These are very leak-proof and easy to clean. Took her only a couple times before she got the hang of using this cup. The straw size is big, so a lot of water comes through, but she's able to control it now that she's older. Definitely cannot live without these."
86414,1,"My husband tells everyone, even single people without children, to get a hand held video monitor when they have their first kid. I think he loves it so much because he knows it has lessened (not eliminated) my new-mother worrying.I love the monitor as well. We both STRONGLY encourage a video monitor over a sound only one. Babies make lots of noises when they sleep. There are times he cries out and we look in on him with the monitor and he's happily asleep. I can't imagine all the times we would have interrupted his sleep if it weren't for this monitor. Now that I'm a more calmed mother I actually only have the volume on when I'm in the shower. Other than that I turn the volume down and just listen for noise coming through his nursery wall. When I hear it I go to the monitor and ""peek"" in to see what is happening. Often times I can tell by his body movement that he will go right back to sleep if just left alone. And he does.This was possibly the best gift we received (it was on our amazone wish list). A couple of my friends went in on it together. I'll never forget their kindness. This is worth it's weight in gold, especially if you don't plan on co-sleeping. I was terrified by the idea of sharing my bed with my baby. This monitor gives you the same level of reassurance with the security of a safe crib. Love Love Love it. Our little guy has been a great sleeper from the start and I know this monitor is partially to thank for that.Don't hang it directly above the crib and keep the cord out of reach. Follow all the safety guidelines and you'll love it too."
114185,1,My new granddaughter came to visit family for the first time at 8 months old and this was a perfect booster chair for her. We could take it with us and always had a secure seat for her. Probably not what you'd want as your one and only little chair but certainly works great at &#34;Grandma's House&#34; ... easy to clean and attached securely to almost any chair. Highly recommend!
73496,1,"The Itzbeen has kept me sane since my little boy was born in October. I LOVE IT! I use it to keep track of the last diaper change, last feeding, and which side I last fed on. I have used the wildcard timer once to keep track of when to give my little guy breathing treatments (thanks to a really bad cold!). I agree with some of the other reviewers that it's not that necessary for diaper changes. If a baby is dirty, change him. But I still like to use it for that. It's just nice to know when the last time I did it or my husband did it. Mostly the Itzbeen is great for keeping track of feedings! Before I had my little guy I could tell you that there were 3 hours between 9am and 12pm. But once my little guy arrived and I was sleep deprived (still am) I had no idea how to tell time or know how long it had been since the last time I fed him. The Itzbeen is also great because my husband can look at it and tell if the baby is crying because he is hungry or just because he wants to. The alarm on the timer is great too. In the first month or so after birth the baby needed to eat every 3 hours even if he was asleep. I would set the timer so I wouldn't sleep through a feeding if the baby didn't wake up (didn't happen often but did on occasion). I have recommended this item to several friends and they have all fallen in love with it. I would highly recommend it to any first time moms and any mom who is breastfeeding. This is a great product."
86029,1,"We just bought this to leave at my mother's house. We've had one (of this exact model) for nearly three years now. We've used it EVERY DAY for nap and bedtime for nearly 3 years - with NO PROBLEMS. It's really super reception. I LOVE that the volume is a dial that you can adjust very precisely. Many other monitors are ""digital"" and you get to click up and down between 4 choices of volume - I hate that.We do get some interference - and what I mean is that someone nearby uses the same one, so we have to use Channel B and that family must be on Channel A. We don't actually leave it turned on at night - I only flip it on if I hear him and want to see what he's up to.I can walk to the neighbor's house and still see the image - but the sound gets static. Doesn't matter - I don't need the volume if I can see the image.The monitor is overall the #1 thing I've purchased/used since my son was born. I plan on continuing to use it after he's out of the crib in a bed in his room - just to keep an eye on what's he's up to once he has more freedom!"
58447,1,"This sterilizer is VERY simple to use. You just pour in the amount of water according to your microwave wattage for the amount of time. Recommended over the more expensive, non-microwave models."
143488,0,"First off, I love this company and what they stand for. I use many of their products.Second, I have used this particular product for over a year as a body wash for myself and as a bath wash for my kids. I never used it on my kids' hair because it is not tear-free (used Lafe's instead).That said, I have been trying to find more natural shampoos for myself when it dawned on me that I have this great product sitting in my bathroom already - why not use it?!? So I did. And now I'm sad.After a few days, my hair felt like a greasy pile of straw and looked like a rat's nest. I normally have very soft, very straight hair. Instead, it feels like it's loaded with product (which I pretty much never use). I almost have that ""right off the beach"" saltwater look, but not in a good way.I stopped using it for a week and it went back to normal. I just tried it again and this time, after just one use, it reverted right back to the gross, dirty-looking, dull state. Without any prompting, my sister-in-law even commented that my hair didn't look as shiny as it usually does (I can't imagine what she *really* wanted to say!).I'm actually only here on Amazon now because I came to look at reviews to see if this is a common problem. I saw one other person comment about it but it appears that no one else uses it on their own hair. Well, heed my warning: don't try it. You'll be sorry.Oh well. I'll continue using this as a body wash, but it's not going anywhere near my head again!"
93037,1,We are approaching our one year anniversary of owning two of these cots for our two young children. The cots are holding up very well. We have taken them tent camping numerous times and have hauled them to the grandparent's house. In addition to the ease of providing a comfortable place for our little ones to sleep they make a great extra bed during sleepovers.The cots fold up small and easily store under a toddler bed or a twin size bed. They take up less room then a folding camp chair in your vehicle. They are durable and have with stood hours of sleeping and many additional hours of being a place for our son to sit and play during rain storms while camping. We are rating with five stars.
124414,1,We went through 3 different types of toilet locks before finding one we liked. This one is easy for adults to open (which is great when you have guests over) and simple to install.
144555,1,"These bags are great! I do not personally feel as though they have a strong smell as I read in some of the bad reviews. They are great at home and out-and-about. At home just throw the soiled diaper in the bag, tie-up and throw in regular trash... no smell! i use the bags for both wet and poopy diapers as we do not fill our trash can quickly and if I don't use the bag for both it begins to smell. When running errands they are great for soiled clothes, tie-up the soiled onesie in the sack and it prevents your diaper bag from smelling!"
68368,0,"3 problems:1. The nipple tears off if he baby is teeting or chews it. The milk comes too fast because of this and also spills out.2. If the bottle is dropped on hard floor, the lid comes off.3. You got to turn just once to close the lid. So if it is even a bit loose and the baby plays with it a bit, there is a chance that the lid comes off.I regularly have the above problems but I still keep using it. The manufacturer should sell the nipples seperately too."
150683,0,"Once completed, this chest is very nice, however, I did not expect to have to assemble this as much as was required.This was basically a bunch of boards that are cut to size with holes for screws."
145719,1,"My son was colicky as an infant and cried most of the time. At four months old, we put him into this jumper (the recommended age is 6 months). He instantly loved the jumper, and was able to use it at a young age because of the great head support it provides. Other jumpers do not have the high back. His neck and leg muscles developed quickly, and by 6 months, he was a jumping pro! This jumper was the only thing my son enjoyed, and he LOVED it! It is made well and the toys kept him amused for long periods of time. I definitely recommend this product - it was the absolute best item we ever bought."
152004,1,"I love how portable this potty is! Our son learned to use the potty a few weeks ago. We quickly realized we needed something for when we're out and about and don't have time to find the nearest bathroom (diapers and pull-ups were out of the question). This was the perfect solution! It comes with a great carrying case. We use the scented pet waste bags (17""x7"") that have the straps. The bags that come with the potty are good but a little large. I feel awful throwing such a big bag away when the pet waste bags are just right! We tried it out for the first time last week when we went to the zoo. We found a nice clean walkway off to the side, pulled the potty out of its case and voila! No lines, no mess...and above all...no accidents! Thank you, Fisher-Price, for making the perfect potty for us families on-the-go!"
176170,1,I use these with the 12 oz Klean Kanteen bottles for my sons - this protects their skin from getting too cold.
94135,1,"My twin sons just turned 8 months old and they really love thier jumpsters!These jumpsters are cheap (alot cheaper than an exersaucer would have been) and we found out our boys like them MUCH better than exersaucers. Putting them together was simple, just snapping everything together. I love how easy it is to attatch to a doorframe (even with two in a large doorway), just open the clamp, and than let it hang over the molding. Its very sturdy (even my 3 year old daughter could hang from it, which she does when she thinks no ones looking!). Its easy to take off also, and it stores so easily in a closet or in our car. Jumping in it takes little effort on the boys part, they have been able to do it since they could hold their heads upright. Its easy to adjust to different hieghts also, and I never thought it could adjust to any lenght AT ALL! My sons could jump all day and night if they wanted (seriously) but I only let them jump for up to 45 minutes. Having this for an active baby lets them sleep MUCH better and less restlessly. I also love that theres no toys, but we can easily attatch link-a-doos or something to it.I LOVE the doorbouncer, theres no question that the boys (and my 3 year old daughter!) love it much, much more!"
136453,2,"We bought this item a month ago and we waited to put it together, and we were certainly disappointed. You must be very careful putting this thing together since it is mostly particle board with fiber board drawer bottoms and backing. It has a screw and cam assembly mechanism, which makes it easy to put together but the cams are not high quality and can be warped if you turn them too far. The nicest part of the pieces is the solid pine tops and drawer fronts, but if you have worked with pine, you probably know it is not the best wood, although the finish is nice. So be careful putting the drawer pulls on, if you're using a drill low torque and go slow or yours will end up like ours - loose and very wobbly. The last complaint is the missing piece - and an important one at that. (We were missing the front cross brace.) If you are looking for a low budget table for the short term and don't care about quality then this table might be for you.... for us though had we not trashed the box before assembly - this would have been returned."
170892,0,"Although the sheet feels ok to the touch and is very easy to get on and off, the &quot;fitted&quot; claim isn't so. It bunches and wrinkles. Not a very tight fit at all. I have even tried washing and drying at a high heat to shrink it, but to no avail.I am dissappointed that Graco makes these for their product and it is still a poor fit."
73484,1,This product is top notch. It is husband-proof (I dropped it pretty good shortly after we got it). It has many different functions and is extremely easy to use (useful for the 3am nursing sessions).I can't recommend this any higher!
108270,0,"What would I do without my Hotsling? My 9 week old baby has loved the closeness of being in the sling from the very beginning. When she fusses, this is the only sure way to get her calm and sleeping. With her cuddled up close to me in the sling, I can get work done around the house, go shopping or take a walk. My baby isn't comfortable in the Baby Bjorn yet, so the sling is an absolute lifesaver.There are two drawbacks of this sling:1. It is not comfortable to wear for long periods of time. After an hour or so, my back is starting to hurt.2. It is not adjustable, so my husband can't use it. It seems ridiculous to have to buy another $40 sling for him.Next time, I might try an adjustable sling so that my husband and I can both use it."
170699,0,"Is an okay product, but I am not sure that I would recommend the product to others."
22518,1,I just purchased this pack N play for $60.00 overall the quality is great. Color is bright and will work for a boy or girl. Very satisfied with this purchase.
10135,1,"my son tried the peter potty pop top and the pee guard on that is not very good for a boy. this trainer seat is awesome, my son has no problem with it. the seat adjusts to fit all different sized toilets and the guard is nice and high. easy to clean as well."
66214,1,"My little fella was born a few weeks early and didn't want to bottle feed. Needless to say I spent a lot of time looking for a good bottle and think I tried them all.After a couple of weeks of watching him turn his nose up at Advent, Playtext and the rest I happened upon Dr. Brown's. It is still the only bottle he will touch. It is rare in this day and age to come a crossed truly wonderful products that are worth swearing by but Dr. Browns are worth the $s. If your child is finicky and/or has gas problems give these a try.Thanks,Brett"
27102,1,"This product is good and easy to wear under clothes. I do notice some difference wearing this whenever I go on longer walks and around the office all day. The sizing is definitely off, I am 150lbs in the third trimester and comfortably fit into the medium on the tightest setting. When I get really close to the end I can see myself putting on the second setting if it got too tight.UPDATE:I'm towards the end of my third trimester now and I still occasionally wear the belt, though to be honest my stomach is so huge I'm not sure that anything could help at this point."
27007,1,I tried other belts and they were uncomfortable. This one is great because it is slimmer and has hooks instead of velcro that sticks to your cloth and underwear.I weight 160 lbs and 23 weeks along; size Med fits perfectly.
72463,1,"I tried everything to get my britax frontier tight, I have other carseats and had no issue with them, but the bottom of the seat is flat and kept slipping on leather so I tried it and it work great no more movement."
60581,0,"After reading reviews of the Eurobath, I was anxious to get one before my baby was born. When he was ready for his first real bath (3 wks old), we found that the surface of this tub was too hard for him,he felt uncomfortable, and too large (he was about 8 pounds and 21 inches at the time). A good feature is the &quot;infant seat&quot; which keeps him well positioned so both your hands are free to wash baby. But this is probably going to be better for our baby when he's a little bigger."
21847,0,I have a 13 month old child. This seat was excellent for the taxi ride (20-30mins) to/from the airport. I would not use it for long trips in my car b/c it didn't ever feel tight enough for long enough where a bump on the road or a wiggling little boy couldn't get it dangerously loose. It might have just been my kind of car b/c it seemed tighter in the taxi. You can't use it on the plane either. I was happy that it was small and portable. It fit in the front pocket of my suitcase. I'll definitely take it to NYC with me for short taxi rides there. I am amazed that it passes all the safety regulations for a legitimate car seat!
116626,1,I just got this item and haven't used it yet but it seems to be very sturdy and good quality. It is very large and what I expected. I love the colors and material.
132411,0,"We got this wipes warmer a day into life with baby #1, and it does the job(hence, 3 stars). However, my sister has used the Prince Lionheart line of warmers, and of course I thought warmers were all about the same regardless of brand. Not so - this one feels much more cheaply made than the PL warmers (which are priced similarly or less than Munchkin). More concerning, the cord and plug gets hot when it's plugged in for any amount of time. Now, the manual says not to HAVE it plugged in for long periods (or something to that effect) but what is the point of a wipes warmer if you have to turn it on, wait for it to warm the wipes and THEN change the crying baby half an hour later? Anyhow, we got it because we were desperate and it was on the store shelf when we needed it, but NEXT time, I'm getting a Prince Lionheart wipes warmer."
28960,0,"This is a super comfortable and sturdy chair, and I really wanted to give it five stars, but the fabric with the espresso wood is not beige. It is is very very white. Also, if you plan on breastfeeding with a Boppy pillow in this chair, think again. The Boppy pillow won't fit around you in the chair unless you are super skinny. Other than that, it is a good rocker, especially for the price. It is just not as functional as I had hoped."
16827,2,"This bed rail is the perfect size but it won't stay put. The ""L"" shaped hooks it uses to grab the other side of the mattress flop over and as soon as one or both of the do, the bed rail pulls away from the mattress. I tried everything including less (or more) tension on the straps and nothing worked.The hide away feature is a joke. The bed rail gets caught up in the sheet. I hate to return items but the bed rail went back. My rating: Amazon ten, bed rails zero."
144293,1,My son loves this seat. We have 3 different Britax models and this one is by far his favorite. It's very comfortable and he loves the color!
175579,2,"This product should be recalled. It's sold based on the premise of reducing SIDS by using it as a blanket.My husband and I were horrified to check on our child in the middle of the night (our movement monitor even beeped to say he had stopped breathing) and see all this material bunched up around his face!!! I was angry, and felt guilty for trusting the claims of this product. (I just saw that another reviewer said the same thing on the cream-colored version of this same product).I loved the idea of this combo sleepsack/swaddle. However, it is easy for a child to work his/her fingers out at the bottom of the swaddle arms - at least it is for our child. If your child can break out of other swaddles (which most of my friends kids can) then DO NOT USE THE SWADDLE PART OF THIS BLANKET!How does is get messed up? I put our child in the sleepsack/swaddle a second time so I could watch (supervised) how the material ended up bunched up. Even with a tight swaddle, and the swaddle arms velcro'd as low as they will go on the back of the sleepsack... if the child bends their legs up at all, their fingers can start to feel the bottom of the swaddle arms. Then, the baby can work their fingers and arms out from the bottom. The result is that the swaddle part bunches up around their neck and face (even with the little tab in the back secured).RECOMMENDATIONS:Halo should add velcro and/or snaps on the front of the swaddle arms to attach it to the sleepsack to keep it in place.Use the ""Swaddle Me"" blankets instead for a safer swaddle option. There is less material, and the baby's legs actually pull down on the swaddle, so it keeps any loose material away from baby's face if the baby manages to break out. (With this HALO sleepsack/swaddle, the baby's legs don't help pull down on the swaddle arms)."
73655,2,"I bought this timer for my newborn baby to record feedings/sleeping. I've used it for 1 week, but today it fell from my rocking chair to the floor and now the screen is completly cracked and the timers do not work. My chair seat is about 18 inches from the floor.It's a great idea, timing your feeding and sleeping, but buy a different brand or download an app on your phone. This product is cheaply made and not durable through standard usage."
170397,2,"My toddler son can easily reach down, lift the Velcro fabric patch, lift the metal release clamp and loosen the straps on his car seat. This happened the first time when I was driving in the HOV lanes during morning rush hour. It was quite a shock, and created a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, I did not have an accident, as my child would surely have been seriously injured.We own the Wizard car seat, but the Britax Boulevard (the replacement for the Wizard) and the Marathon seats all use this faulty shoulder strap system. Many other parents of toddlers have reported the same problem with these seats, and there is at least one other specific complaint re the Marathon on this comment page.We are loyal owners of Britax car seats (we own one Roundabout and two Wizard car seats), but I am appalled with the design of this strapping system and outraged by Britax's response to my complaint.Britax first denied this was a design flaw and informed me that I need to teach my son the meaning of the word ""no"". Then they told me that I should use a safety pin to secure the fabric cover. Other parents posting on BabiesRUs and Babycenter.com have reported this same response to their complaints.I also filed a written complaint with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) and with BabiesRUs. Since Britax is not voluntarily responding to this dangerous situation, parents must take action. Take a look at the placement of the metal clamp on the Blvd., Marathon or Wizard seats. If you have had a problem with your child pulling up the clamp and loosening the straps, or if you just agree that this situation is dangerous, first file a complaint with the NHTSA at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/, then post your comments on this web site. Of note, the NHTSA ratings give all three seats the top A rating for ""ease of use"" for securing the child. I agree the seats are easy to use; however, they are so easy to use they are DANGEROUS."
30890,0,"This was a very useful car seat-combination-stroller. The problem I have with it is that the seat belt straps cross over the child's chest for securing the seat into the car and airplane seat. My two-year old, surprisingly, did not raise objections to this, but I imagine that could become a big problem. Also, the airplane seat belt straps just barely were long enough to strap in the seat. In addition, sometimes the mechanism that brings out the wheels and retracts them stuck. This was very inconvenient in the security line for the airport. On the plus side, the stroller moved very smoothly."
137540,1,We love our turtle!! We use it every night for our twin babies. We ened up buying a second one for our 3 year old also. Its great because you can just pack it up and take it with you which is easier than taking a mobile. They love to lay in their beds and just stare at the stars. Another good thing is its no too bright. But the best part is the fact that you can pack it and take it on trips..well worth it..a must have
53073,0,"I've had this bag for 9 months now, and think that it's an OK item. There are a few things that I like about it, and a few that I don't.What I like: it has a magnet, so you don't have to zip it. It's a great plus for me, because I oftentimes have to use it with just one hand available.It has a lot of room inside and many compartments. It came with a changing pad, although it's pretty big and takes up a lot of space. I also like that the bag has an insulated compartment for bottles. The strap is pretty wide, and the bag stays on your shoulder.what I don't like: the zippers break so easily! I mean, they still work, but the part that you hold on to, when zipping or opening the bag, comes off. I had one of them come off as soon as I received the bag, and took it out of the box. An insulated compartment for baby's bottles is too small. I could barely fit my 4 oz Avent bottles in there. And now, then I'm using bigger bottles, they don't fit in there at all."
63812,1,"It has everything I have been looking for. 5pt harness, ratcheting canopy (that stays put unlike the ellipsa I had- that thing was a joke), large basket (basket does not spring down but is still accessible when seat is reclined), parent and child trays (parent tray has covered compartment and child tray has nice deep snack area w/cupholders), one hand fold, stands when folded (yeah! No dirty, scratched or torn parts), linked rear brakes (so you only have to push one side and BOTH wheels lock), wheel suspension with front wheel lock for rough terrain, seat lays completely flat and footrest comes up to enclose seat to make carriage, height adjustable handlebar (which goes high enough for my 6'2"" husband!), nice soft breathable material (it is still quite warm here in FL), footrest, and has lightweight aluminum frame. I bought mine in the Sahara pattern (see cust. pics I uploaded) along with the keyfit carseat which I also love (and reviewed). The only thing I can say even remotely in a negative direction is it does take a bit of trying to get the one hand fold thing down. It folds by squeezing a button and at the same time lifting a handle- not real hard but can be a bit tricky at first. Aside from that in the few weeks we have had it in use I can say I don't have anything to complain about. The car seat clips on easily, the canopy covers completely and the ride is smooth. I do have to mention that while it is considered lightweight it is not THE most lightweight you can get- so whoever is looking for the most lightweight/compact this is not it. It is a great stroller and I do recommend it along with the chicco keyfit carseat."
74718,1,The hanger is not very heavy duty (received broken) I was able to use just a childs sizes hanger and it fit really well. The overall look is great and holds a lot of diapers. I am very pleased for the price I paid for this item
77162,1,This is perfect. It has lights and sounds that keep my little one entertained. I love how you can plug it in so you don't have to worry about batteries.
71835,2,"Pros:-Large, easily accessible basket.-Large cup/snack holder.-Long handle keeps you from kicking the stroller wheels as you walk.Cons:-Most car seats *do not* snap onto the frame including some that are supposedly compatible according to the manual (including my Graco SnugRide, which did not fit).-The only thing left to secure the carseat to the frame is a belt that snaps across the middle of the carseat. If you run into something, the car seat flips upward, pivoting on the strap.I took this to Babies R Us and tried it with all the infant seats, but could not find one that actually snapped onto the cross bar of this stroller frame (tried Evenflo, Combi, Graco SafeSeat). I was disappointed because I do like the design of the stroller and would have kept it if I could find a compatible carseat. I ended up returning this and getting a Graco SnugRider stroller frame instead - not as nice but at least my Graco seat sanps onto it securely."
103428,2,"This gate works very well initially but the knobs will freeze, rendering it useless. I used it for about a year and a half before this occurred. I think the life of a gate should last much longer than that."
164631,0,I don't know if my baby is tiny or I am using the wrong size but these diapers sag on the bottom end and have a strong odor. My baby developed a rash couple of times while using these. It might be due to food but I am not getting these again.
83092,2,"I was really excited for these tupperware dishes to arrive and when they finally did, I realized that the lids were too small and you couldn't close the plates. Obviously, they were defected. Amazon was very helpful though and sent me a return address slip so I wouldn't have to pay for the actual return, but still, what a pain! I just wanted to use these plates."
32209,0,"I purchased this hoping it would save me time preparing Thanksgiving dinner. I had hoped it would be able to rice potatoes and remove the peels...not so. While the mill is strong and sturdy, the blade did not fit closely enough to really remove peels. It did however work nicely sifting flour. I hope it does a better job making applesauce.Additionally, it was pretty heavy and it was difficult to find a bowl to fit it.I should have believed the reviews I read, but it just looks so great...next time I shall just buy a potato ricer."
89879,1,"I really think pampers baby dry are really good and so are huggies, but you know what? I am sticking with the pampers baby dry because you get more diapers and its really the same as Huggies.I am a mother of my fourth child now and believe me I even made mistakes putting on the diaper on my newborn son as well because its been awhile.I find if you change the baby as often as you should and put them on correctly you will find really no different beside the bulkyness of huggies.I like the fact that Pampers baby dry sells larger cases of diapers, I don't run out as quickly.I would stay away from store brand diapers all together because there not made well."
103913,0,"I am very pro breastfeeding and nursed both my kids for 15-20 mos. This pump worked fine while it worked, but generally speaking, I really don't like to pump. I have used both the medela and the isis duo. The medela bag design is much better. This square bag is like carrying around a suitcase. Very annoying when you also have to cart around a laptop. The plus to the avent bag design is that it holds the filled bottles upright inside their cooler packs which helps minimize leakage.I am writing this review because of the lack of longevity in the product. The motor on my pump (purchsed in 2007) has failed twice. The first time was under warrenty and Phillips Avent sent a new motor. The replacement motor has now failed, and because it is no longer under warrently Phillips Avent refuses to do anything. They will not even allow the purchase of a new motor. If I want another functioning breast pump, I have to buy the whole thing over again and they would not offer a discount. For a $300 (this is how much it was when I first purchased it as it was new to the market) pump to not even last through 2 babies with moderate use, I have to say, I would never purchase Avent again. I pumped maybe 9 times per week for maybe 12 mos total on the replacement motor. That could even be a high estimate. I have not researched numbers, but I would guess that is moderate use at best. I have known Medelas to last through several moms (yes i know you are not supposed to share and if these companies cared at all about moms and babies, they would make pumps more affordable so that we didn't have to share). The Avent motor seems to simply not be designed to last. I would recommend medela over the avent purely based on the fact that medela pumps seem to last. I am very annoyed to have to buy a whole new pump if i have a 3rd baby. I begged Phillips Avent to work with me on getting a new pump motor and they simply wouldn't."
138194,1,This is the best night ever created! Awesome in a room 3 different colors and it is bright. It also has a cool feature that shuts itself off after 45 minutes. The bad thing is its not a plug in so it might go through batteries fairly quickly but worth it for how neat it really is.
183268,0,"This looked like a great product for the price. I'm not going to list the things I do like about it, because nothing special comes to mind and the manufacturer's description talks about it enough. My baby isn't even born yet, but I don't think I'd buy this again, for the following reasons:1. I opened the box and could find NO instructions. I finally gave up searching -- the only place they could be was something I couldn't figure out how to open without instructions -- and found some on their website instead. The first vague step told you to open push some tabs to open the carrier portion, which I finally found, and sure enough, the instructions had been locked inside the folded carrier, which I never would've figured out how to open without instructions. SERIOUSLY FRUSTRATING!2. The remaining instructions were a bit less vague, though a few steps did make me wish I had about six hands. I did manage to complete it without calling for my boyfriend's help, though.3. The pictures and instructions claim that there is a pocket for diaper-changing accessories. Mine has no such pocket. Not a huge deal for me, but still -- NOT as advertised.4. By far my biggest issue with this thing is the wheels. First, because of the rocking feature, it is built with the bars making the whole thing MUCH wider than it would be otherwise, and even though my apartment has *wider* doors than normal, it's still a pain to move around because there are a lot of turns, some of them more than 90 degrees. This is complicated by the fact that the wheels are crappy plastic and don't turn well in the first place; by the fact that it's easy to accidentally lock the wheels so they don't turn at all (though it's sometimes hard to tell if they're locked anyway because the wheels turn so poorly in the first place); and by the fact that only two of the wheels are casters -- the others are fixed and do not swivel. So basically, the wheels are completely worthless, and in order to move it around, I have to shove/drag/lift the whole thing. I suspect this will get old fast, but I'm not sure what else I can do.Overall, this item is far less mobile than I'd hoped. I probably should have returned it immediately."
26878,1,It helps a lot to support your tummy but when you are in the final months it is not so good because you feel a lot of pressure in your lower tummy
176813,2,"So we thought the features like the cooling and heating would be great, nowhere did it say it would not work with glass bottles until we opened it. Then for Breast Milk you basically have to heat it twice so the 5 min turns into 20 min (5 plus 10 for cool down plus another 5) This was a great disappointment and I am happily packing it up for return."
60081,1,"had this and loved this for more than three years through two kids, until the plug broke. i was disappointed, but did not like any of the other tubs i saw in stores so i ordered another one for our third baby. then i noticed, on the attached flier, Primo's contact info. so i emailed them to ask if they had replacement plugs, and they did! only $2 including shipping. so now i've got two that are both still like new."

132559,0,"Dries out the wipes faster but otherwise nice. I would not say that you have to have it, it's more of a nice to have."
102755,2,"It does keep in some odors, but is definitely not ""odorless!"" (Notice the product name is ""Odor-Less""). Many parents will be fooled by the name, like I was. I was looking for an inexpensive pail that would take plain trash bags, but I do not think this has saved me that much money. The first pail we bought wouldn't stay closed, so we had to take it back to the store. The one we have now works OK, but it is easy for my daughter to open (as well as all her little friends), and the compartment for the deodorizing disk comes off easily as well. (I found one of her friends sucking on it!) The disk also does a poor job of deodorizing--we definitely need something else to replace it. As it states above, it takes an average of 18-24 diapers, and if you have a bigger child, that number falls. I have two in diapers, and this fills up in a day or so. That is very inconvenient for me--I live in an apartment and have to traipse out to the dumpster. I usually end up smashing as many diapers as I can in to the pail, which then further compromises the design that's supposed to keep out the smell. I think this is poorly designed anyway--the deodorizing disk compartment and the doors the diaper falls through take up a lot of space. It's also kind of a pain to put the bag in the way they tell you to. All in all, it's better than using a plain garbage can, but look around for a better diaper pail, unless you can't afford them. By the way, I have been very disappointed with most, if not all, the products I've bought from Safety 1st (...)"
60162,1,"I works great as it has 2 sides. Start on one when she was a newborn, but then as she got older, she moved to the other side. About 2 months into it realized that the plug actually suctions to the side on the tub, so the water flows easily. It is bulky though, so you need to have space in the bathroom to store it and to use it. The Primo sign fell of within a couple of months."
158161,0,"We bought this changing table for two reasons: (a) it matched our cribs in both color and style; and (b) it was weight-rated high enough that we planned to use it to change both our infant and our two-year-old. While it's great looking and has been a huge help with storage, we have been completely unable to change the toddler on it. The first time we set him on the changing area, the metal bars holding the top shelf up began to bend with his weight, and at 30 pounds, he was easily ten pounds under what it stated it could hold. Disappointed that we couldn't use it for that - now we have a changing area on the floor of their room AND a changing table - but it looks great and has been a lifesaver for diaper storage and beyond. Highly recommended, but not for children over 20-25 lbs."
79198,1,"We've been using this on our four year old since she was about 1 or so, and I wish we'd started sooner, it's extremely gentle on her skin and mine also. The money you save on creams and such to treat skin irritations will pay for the product. I also love their bubble baths, you will never have another yeast infection again because of a bubble bath...we're expecting number 2 in three months and I am taking a small bottle of the Super Sensitive Body Wash to the hospital for their first bath! =0)"
39726,1,"This product serves it's purpose but I recommend the HoMedics Sound Spa for $12 at Target Stores!! There are several sounds (ie, rain, ocean, heartbeat, summer night, river, etc.) and the volume goes from really low to quite loud. There's also a timer on it too."
52963,0,"I love this chair, my 11 week old daughter loves it too, but today while she was sitting in it, I noticed it cut the back of her heel in two places, it was caused by kicking the motor. So please take caution when your child gets a little older and starts to kick. Otherwise I love the chair it is the best for a gassy baby."
25185,2,"The music goes off all the time...often waking us up in the middle of the night. Sometimes it's just 1 royal tune and sometimes it goes on playing tune after tune for who knows how long. And like another reviewer said...you can't turn it off, you just have to take the thing apart. This also makes it really ineffective as a reward for the child b/c it will play music for my daughter without her doing anything in it. So, she's getting rewarded for sitting there and not forming the reward association with doing something in the potty. She's also fearful of the big toilet, so taking the removable seat off and using the base as a step stool right now is not an option."
172140,1,"This tub is pretty solid even though it's also very light. It's well designed to be comfortable for the baby. The first 10 or so times my daughter got a bath she cried, but now she loves loves it! My wife usually puts her in and then pours water over her instead of dunking her in the water. That method works good because then you can rinse the baby off and there won't be too much water in the tub when you do that. 5 stars, I cant imagine giving my baby a bath without it!"
176574,1,"I have tried these for the first time with my fourth child. I wish I would have used this system for all my children. I have used all kinds of bottles from the old glass bottles to Vent-air to Avent...many types with my first 3 children. I decided to give these a try considering I was tired of scrubbing bottles. My little girl switched to these very easily from the breast, it helped tremendously with her colic by cutting down on gas (switching from regular formula to soy helped to, plus I had to start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding)plus they are so easy to clean and manage. I have had no leak problems like I did with Avent...Vent-air #1 nipple would collapse plus my son would have projectile spit-up after feedings when I tried to switch him to the #2 nipples (awful system)...absolutely no problems with the original Playtex bottles. My only minor complaint is trying to fit my fingers in the bottle to collapse the liner to rid of air...very hard if you do not have tiny hands. We bought the easy-feed bottles with the lift in the bottom to aid in releasing air...alittle easier. Store brand liners work just as well as brand name liners...I have seen no difference except in price. Target brand is very good. I would recommend these bottles to everyone!"
4591,1,"This bag is great for moms and dads. Comfortable to wear, easy to use and holds quite a bit. As a first-time parent, I really appreciate the ease of use with this bag."
109857,1,Easy to install. Stays in place. Folds down. Does what we wanted it to do. Here's the funny bit...we're using it to keep an elderly dog from falling out of bed. Certainly cheaper than the VET bills.
161147,1,"This cute kit has everything you need, except the nasal aspirator. Everything works well. It's great for travel and the little carrying case is large enough to throw in a bulb syringe and a thermometer."
161967,2,"I just dont know what to say about this tub. No matter how many times I read the instruction,the thing kept leaking!!! The only way to use it without making a mess was to use it in the tub. There goes my back,right after having my baby!"
27714,1,"This item ships with tires deflated, so don't expect to use it without a trip to get air! The brakes were a little stiff, but WD-40 did the trick. That understood, AWESOME, per my daughter. The twins like it, too.It's a bit wide, but that adds stability, a trade-off.Instructions feature photos from the single model, a little confusing."
55938,0,"It's small and efficient. HINT: when in doubt, take the bottle out, shake the contents and assess temp. if still cold put back in if not go ahead and use... It's cheaper than warming up bottles by running tapwater and less cumbersome than using the microwave to heat water to then heat up bottle... although it needs some tweaking (or more precise add-watter guidelines) I'd buy it again."
146069,1,My grandson is now 9 months old. This has been the best baby gear buy for him to date. He still uses it everyday and it has been worth much more than the cost in the enjoyment he has received from this item.
178894,1,"I am the mom of four children. Our last baby is now 18 months and I can't count how many different strollers I have. The umbrella stroller that I have owned for the past 3 kids was great. I got it at a swapmeet and it met my needs. But it has gotten trashed and I was in need for a new one since we would be traveling a lot with the whole family this summer. I did a lot of research online and ran around to many baby superstores to try out different stollers. I actually bought two others before I finally decided to see what the chicco stroller had to offer. I am so happy with my decsion. I feel like it was the best for me. Other stollers were not so wide and my feet would kick the wheels when I would push them. The chicco is wide enough that this dosen't happen. Also the handle bars are long. I am 5'7"" and it is very comfortable for me. It steers very smooth and I love that is has a basket underneath. It folds up very easy and takes up as much room as a standard umbrella stroller would. The cost is more than a standard one, But it is worth it. I feel very good about my decsion."
71857,1,I have had this stroller for about 5 years now. It is so light weight and easy to maneuver. As a mom of 4 kids those features come in handy.
19479,0,"I bought these for my son as his first sippy cup (around 8 months). He had trouble in part because when you screwed the lid on, the mouthpiece never centered when holding it by the handles. First I thought he wasn't getting the hang of cup drinking, then I switched to a handle free sippy and problem solved! I brought these out again after a few months practice and he uses them just fine (at 1 year old)."
101666,2,"I thought this monitor set would solve all our problems -- ability to listen to 2 children and have receivers in different rooms. Yes, it does that but there is a lot of static and the receiver had to be turned up too high in order to hear the kids. The scanning feature was a big disappointment -- probably the biggest disappointment with this unit. The scanning feature allows you to listed to each monitor for a few seconds each. Problem is, if you are only using 2 of the 3 units then you will hear unit 1, unit 2 and then static for the unit not being used. That is very annoying. It should only scan units currently in use -- or at least not deliver static for the unit not used.In short, this unit offers more than is delivered."
55959,2,"I bought this warmer thinking it's more convenient than warming milk with hot water, but actually it is not...the amount of water needed is little therefore it has to be very precise to get to the temperature you want! It takes longer to fill the correct amount of water than needed. Also you have to wait 10 minutes to try again, if a bottle is not warm enough, you have to use something else anyway! The instructions state that the unit needs 10 minutes to cool down if you need to use it again, but it may actually take longer than that...I would prefer to use hot water than using this warmer."
54998,1,"Love, love, love this potty seat, and I don't love many products, so I really mean it. it's the perfect shape, conforms to any toilet (so far), is easy to clean, doesn't slip and slide around like other potty seats I've had, and was an instant hit. I bought one for my coworker and one for my sister and they both love it. This is a wonderful product. I can't say it enough!"
168429,1,"Size 2s are accurately sized + work well for dryness + holding everything in. Keeps our baby happy, which keeps us happy."
155359,0,"Product provides protection, but not if it does not stay on the corner of the table. The tape strips provided do not hold the corners up, so they are constantly falling off the table corners. Also, the double sided tape was very hard to peal from it's backing. I suppose I can go to the hardware store and buy new tape, but I shouldn't have to, the tape it comes with SHOULD have been enough to do the job, but it wasn't. But they are so worth using, that I probably will go buy better tape."
26376,1,"I LOVE that you can plug this into an outlet and not worry about batteries! My newborn really likes the swinging motion. My only complaints are that I don't like the removeable tray that you have to take off to put baby in the swing and I think the swing is too fast, even on the lowest setting. Otherwise, I like the controls, I like how the mobile can be pushed behind the swing and the swing is very quiet. I've had Graco swings before and I like this better. And, did I mention that I love the plug?"
44551,1,"I, too, think that the price that Amazon is selling these smaller packs of diapers are way more expensive than say, Target and every other grocery store known to man.Looks like they are overpricing items to help pay for their overhead fees by offering the grocery shopping online. Who knows.But I do know this... I will NEVER buy diapers here... or majority of everything else, for that matter, in their online grocery store. It's way too expensive, especially now during a recession.. and we are all falling on hard times ourselves.I think that if Amazon.com wants to remain in business, they should lower their prices across the board."
170932,0,"bought this on the recommendation of a friend, but somewhat disappointed. the selling point is that it's quiet. the downside is, you have to listen much more carefully than with other (less expensive) monitors. we put the monitor on a table the is directly ajacent to our bassinet. if you are working in the kithchen or the garage and have it on max volume and max sensitivity, you can't hear the baby until he starts to scream at the top of his lungs.all in all it's a decent monitor and is much better looking than most monitors, but i think i'm going to use it for my older baby. we'll use our old monitor for the newborn so we can hear him better."
159889,1,This product works great! I have an old house and I was looking for a gate that would stay locked in on my uneven walls.... this did exactly that!
159875,0,"I purchased this gate because I really wanted a pressure mounted gate to use at the bottom of the stairs but I had read some reviews about pressure mounted gates sometimes failing so I figured with this gate we at least had the option to hardware mount if needed.When installing, we encountered a few problems. First, we have a narrow stairway with a baseboard on one side and a railing on the other side. We found that, although the gate is supposed to automatically adjust to acommodate baseboards, it just wasn't as secure unless we tilted it a little. It did fit nice and snug if we lifted it off the baseboard. But then it was hitting the top of the railing on the other side of the wall. We finally got it to just the right positioning to get a nice secure fit while pressure mounted. But each time we fit the gate in place it takes some finagling to fit it in just right.Which brings me to my next problem. The other major downside to this gate is that it is really designed to be more of a barrier than a gate. And I guess this is my fault for not fully researching before buying (which is why I'm writing this review, to help prepare others) but when I think of a gate, I think of something that will swing or slide open. And this gate does have that feature - but only when hardware mounted. When pressure mounted,this is more of a temporary wall than a gate. If you plan on using the pressure mounting, then you will have to completely remove the gate each time you want to go through it. Our stairs are high traffic areas. It was a total pain to physically remove and replace the gate every time we wanted to go up or down (especially while holding a baby). After just an hour in place, family members were ""jumping"" the gates to use the stairs. Not what I'd envisioned.So, now we're looking at hardware mounting it. I will update this review if we have any new problems with that, but I'm hoping it will solve our problems.I did rate the gate 3 stars because it does exactly what it says it does and seems to be constructed with high quality materials. My only advice is to make sure you know what you're getting before buying."
79430,1,"Buy these, don't even think about it if you're potty training a toddler. They're so much softer, easier for them to use, and get them so much cleaner than just regular toilet paper. Plus, they're not soaking wet like many other, but just the right amount of moisture for little ones. I've bought many of these and we're so happy with them that I will continue to buy them. Thanks for a great idea!"
15830,0,"I would not recommend this for the Chicco Keyfit car seat. The fit is so poor that it looks terrible and because of the bad fit I don't expect our newborn to be able to wear it for the whole winter before he outgrows it. I am very disappointed because I love this product, it is so warm and cozy, both the interior and exterior fabrics are perfect. We have the toddler version we use on our stroller for big sister and it keeps her warm and dry even in rainstorms. But this one just does not fit our car seat, Chicco Keyfit."
162467,2,I purchased this item 1 month ago and my son is 1 month old and it collapsed into the sink with my son in it. do not buy this product.
25224,1,"I put the extensions on the co-sleeper to raise it up since our bed is on the taller side. Perfect. Before ordering, I also did some comparison shopping and found this site to be the least expensive and I believe I received free shipping. Always a bonus!"
153894,0,"I appreciate that these wipes are much more sensitive for my little guy who's prone to rashes, but other reviewers are right when they say these items have a funky smell to them. In my opinion, Earth's Best wipes are just as healthy and ecofriendly and they don't make me gag when I open the package, so I'll be using EB from now on."
119369,1,"I used it starting from my hospital stay and was very pleased with it. I was comfortable, the baby was comfortable. I gave birth in France where this product is not sold, so lots of nurses were at first surprised to see me use it. However, all of them commented at how much more correctly shaped it was compared to local pillows which are kind of U shaped very soft, deformable pillows. I used it for the first 2-3 months (I prefer to nurse her lying next to her)."
59160,1,"This warmer is great. It beats warming the bottle in a cup of water for 15 min. People complain about it not having a timer and auto shut-off. I use mine in the kitchen next to my microwave. When I put the bottle in the warmer I simply set the timer on my microwave to 5 min. No burnt bottles here. Don't listen to the negative reviews. It is a simple, high quality warmer."
138539,1,My daughter loves this. It provides the perfect amount of light and stays on for enough time to allow her to fall asleep. Highly recommend.
164248,0,"Unlike the ones we got at the hospital and Babies 'R Us, these didn't have the wetness indicator--the yellow line that turns blue when the baby pees--which was a disappointment. I think the Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers size 1 still has it (at least according to the amazon description http://www.amazon.com/Pampers-Swaddlers-Sensitive-Diapers-180-Count/dp/B001651192/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=hpc&qid;=1284753490&sr;=1-1.)Also, it says N fits up to 10 lbs., but as size 1 is for 8lbs-14 lbs, may be better to stock up on those. Our girl is 8lbs and the N size already seems a bit snug on her."
62400,1,"I bought this for my 12 month old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. She loves looking at the pictures of mommy, daddy, wolfgang (our dog) and her grandparents. It has helped to teach her who is who (especially the grandparents she doesn't get to see too often) and how to say some words. She takes such pride in turning to the page and pointing to whomever we ask her to show us. When we go out she likes to take it with us and show it to people we meet. She loves it and so do we!"
118357,2,"I bought the 6m+ version of these sippy cups as my daughter has used Avent bottles with great success. My major problem with these cups is that they are so incredibly hard to get any liquid through that my daughter couldn't drink from them!We tried several times over the course of a couple months (she was 6 months when we started them) with no success. When I tried the cup to see if she was just giving up on it because it was new, *I* had a hard time getting the liquid out!So, while I think the rest of the cup is designed well, the handles are easy to grab, the bright colors catch her eye, I through the sippy lid to the back of the drawer. We now use the colored cup part more as an indicator that it does not contain milk, and have started using a Playtex sippy with great success.It's definitely spill proof, but unless your kid is a master of sucking, this very well could be sip-proof as well."
161290,2,"Leaky, leaky tub. The only way my husband and I could use it is by placing this tub in our own tub which is very uncomfortable as we have to bend down during the whole bath time. Put it on the counter and it will leak all over your bathroom floor.But now that our baby is older(since he was about 10 months old), he loves to play while sitting in it with the ramp in place. It is also easier to wash him now that he does not slip and slide all over the place. Without the ramp, this bath tub is worthless."
172090,1,"We used this tub for our newborn, until he was old enough start pulling himself up to standing, around 8 months old. At that point, we ditched the infant tub and put him in the regular tub with some toys.We liked this infant tub because it fit nicely in the big tub OR on top of the kitchen sink. The newborn sling was only useful for those first few baths, until the umbilical cord fell off.I don't think I'd use this for an older infant or a toddler, as it's easy for them to stand up in it because of the sloped bottom, which puts their feet below the level of their butt, and they could lose their balance or tip over the tub. (Obviously supervision is always a must during baths.)"
137067,1,"I wish I'd known about these a long time ago!!These are so easy to install: Pull off the adhesive back to the Velcro strip and adhere that strip to the sides or bottom/top of your window sills at designated amounts that you may safely want your window open. Then stick the wedge with Velcro on the back onto the Velcro on the window and when you open your window, voila! The wedge ""locks"" itself onto the connecting Velcro! Very simple and very effective!! It is easy to take off the wedges from the Velcro on the window -just pull off, then you can open your window wider."
105835,1,The Diaper Champ saves us from wrapping individual dirty diapers in plastic bags to prevent smelling up the room.
120057,1,"These bottles are real nice and do exactly what they say they do , BUT they are a pain to clean, and you can't warm the bottle with the insert and at 4am this can be a pain. Overall though they are worth the few minor pains."
137723,1,"I've wanted the Twilight Turtle for my son's room since he was born, my Mom recently ordered it for him because we're getting ready to have one of his kidneys removed and the hospital is a very scary place for my 18 month old son. This turtle creates such a calming atmosphere for him that we have absolutely no worries about the upcoming stay! Have 0 of the mentioned problems in the negative reviews, everything with it has been perfect. It should be common sense to not allow any child under 3 to actually PLAY with it, overall GREAT product, considering ordering the Ladybug as a baby shower gift for a friend!"
112778,1,"I am buying CozyMe pillows for all of my friends who are new mothers. It is a great product and the perfect gift at baby showers. And it comes in so many different patterns, you'll definitely find one to fit your friends' style."
16986,2,"I bought this to have my baby girl's things more organized and I tried to put it in the back of the door- didnt fit. I see the picture now and instead of back of the door- I am going to see if I put it in a rod!Post review-4/21/2006I stuck 2 nails on it and forget the hooks it comes with- I hung it right on the nail and it fit- I stuffed the pockets and by sticking the 2 nails - it worked for me - so I might just go and buy another one because it sure did lessen some of that cluster I felt I had- put her socks, bibs hair accessories, Her cd's and tapes... I might just put another one for her lotions, onesies, and other things I have an abundance of....Thank YOU!!!!!! Now I give it (with the hooking it up on nails) 4 stars ****"
19740,1,"I wish I would have purchased this bottle warmer from the very beginning. I purchased the Avent Bottle Warmer because I was using Avent Bottles but I recently had to switch bottles and had to purchase a bottle warmer to accommodate those bottles. Little did I know, this bottle warmer works well with Avent bottles as well. The only very small problem is that the numbers on the measuring cups rub off after a week or so which makes it hard to fill them with the correct amout of water for your size bottles. I guess I will have to guestimate at this point."
67081,1,"Great chest - love how much stuff can go in it. It was shipped very well, timely and not bad to assemble.I have had this product for about a month and a half and its sort of coming apart on me....the lid on the one side came off. We were able to use liquid nail to keep it in place...so far so good. It was openend maybe 2 times a week since assembled...and we have to open it for our daughter because its so heavy. Not sure why it detached.All in all, its a great product...very attractive too."
47543,1,"I used this co-sleeper for both of my sons and it held up beautifully - so well, in fact that our friends' newborn girl is now having a go! As said by the other reviewers, it is very easy to pop up, attach and fold away. It is also the best set-up for night feedings and attachment-sleeping. All three babies have enjoyed sleeping in it, and the beauty of the natural style is that it goes with just about any adult decor (no trying to coordinate your duvet to teddy bears and rainbows) without being uncuddly and is completely ungendered. The various pockets and cubbies are perfect for keeping diapering supplies handy and hidden. As for being cumbersome in the bedroom, I found that it helps to put it as close to the head of the bed as possible (if you can, do without a nightstand for the duration) and then your legs are clear for getting in and out. Also, it makes looking over at each other that much easier."
125100,0,"This chair could have been more awesome. The cushions are fine, although I see what people mean about the ""cheap"" fabric; they definitely don't seem built to last. We had problems with the arms, too. The holes in the arms weren't drilled properly, and it was very difficult to get the arms to secure tightly to the back of the chair; in fact, we had to settle for getting them to a point where they weren't actively sliding around. There's still a half-inch gap. The cushions mostly cover it up, but all in all, it's not what we were hoping for. Taking it apart to return it would be impossible by this point (I think we stripped the bolts on the arms trying to tighten them, as well as utterly destroying the allen key that came with the chair) so we're considering keeping it in a room other than the nursery - somewhere where it won't be used so often - and getting another, higher quality one."
71321,1,"We bought this based on other good reviews. I have not been disappointed. My son used it as an infant. My only modification was to use a rolled up towel on each side of him to keep him from falling to the side. This was my saving tool for getting a shower for many months. I would put my son in it right outside the shower so I could talk to him. He was happy to play with the toys. Now as he is getting older (almost 2 years old), he still likes it. I no longer use the toy bar, but he sits in it to relax and watch a show on PBS."
113866,1,"after the original peg perego highchair I had got so dirty w food in all the crevices that wasn't possible to clean up, i didn't want to spend another $300 on peg perego. most other highchairs cost around $150, so then i looked into booster seats instead. i figured why not try this since it is so cheap by comparison. it works beautifully! i strap it to my regular leather bottom dining room chair and made his height adjustable on the booster seat levels so that he is the right fit for my comfort feeding him. what a bargain! and the best part is there are no crevices for food to get stuck. i just wipe it down with a lysol wipe and rinse in the sink."
70328,1,"I have used this gate for 9 months with no major problems. Has a wide opening gate. Easy to remove when not needed (just pull up and out). Like any hard mount gates, you should get longer, better screws for installing. I saw the problem with the foot sliding even on my carpet as it merely ""floats"" under the gate. Solved this by measuring where the base might lift the gate just a bit and screwing in place to the gate - no slipping! Even with our toddler standing on bottom rail and bouncing on it. You should be handy for this one and it will serve you well. Best wide gate for the price."
25986,2,"Lets be honest about something - babies are messy. They're dirty, especially when they are eating. Food gets everywhere. Strained peas go in the hair. Prunes end up, well, I can't really say where. The problem with this high chair is there are too many cracks and crevices into which little ones can deposit their unwanted dinnertime treats. After one meal, the chair is absolutely filthy and disgusting. Then, once you finally get your child unstrapped, stripped, bathed, rediapered and put to bed, you have to go back to the kitchen and face an unholy, god-awful mess that takes forever to clean, because you have to take the entire chair apart and use toothpicks to pick the strained peaches out. This is the second Peg Perego high chair we had. We didn't want this one again, but a now-disowned relative gave it to us as a baby warming gift. Trust me, buy something else."
150396,1,"My mother actually ordered a different design (Mark) from a different site- Google her name and you will find the websites that sell her baskets (plus a whole lot of variety). Because there is nothing else out there like Wendy Anne Moses baskets, I have to say- thank you to her! The fabric is good quality, mine is machine washable, and she includes a mosquito net and extra mattress sheet. I don't have experience with other baskets, but this is more sturdy than I though it would be. The site we used to purchase the basket had a special on the basket stand- Wendy Anne's stand which rocks side to side (which is more natural for babies)- not front to back.The item was shipped directly from Wendy Anne, which I should say could have been packaged a lot better (thank God no damage) and shipped faster- the only reason for not giving this item 5 stars. No packing slip, no instructions, no packaging for the stand. The customer service with the retail/online storefront was fabulous.I would order again in a heart beat, but also with a prayer that the stand ship without damage."
141041,1,"This product is such a reasonable price compared to many different ones I looked at. I know my son will not be eating baby food for a long time so I did not want to spend a lot of money on something. When I received this product it is exactly what I though it would be. The carrying case is great because I can pack it up and bring it to Grandma's or wherever I am going. Assembly was super easy, just follow instructions/pictures( It doesn't take a genius). It puree's everything I have cooked just fine. It has a bunch of little holes so the food comes out like spaghetti. I just cook whatever I'm giving him (sweet potatoes, squash, carrots are a few of the things I have done) put the amount I want in it, assemble, then puree. Once its done I add some fresh breast milk to make it the thin consistency he needs. Which is also great because as he can tolerate more solid foods I can just add less milk till he doesn't need any at all and I can just puree it. I did a lot of research and looked at others reviews and I must say this is the perfect product for anyone getting ready to begin giving their little ones food for the first time. I have really been happy with this product and hope other can enjoy it as well."
2867,0,"The boppy was an excellent idea in theory, but it just didn't work for me. It raised my son up a little too high (I'm tall too!) to be comfortable. It was hard to get this around my waist and get situated while holding a crying infant at the same time. In addition, it was wide enough that I didn't fit down in certain chairs with this thing around me. When I wasn't breastfeeding, I didn't find it all that useful for play like it is recommended. I just wish that I hadn't spend the money on it."
134870,0,"My son is ready for the bigger car seat and is only 5 months. Best to get the infant/toddler car seat right off the bat-wish I had! Yes, it is very heavy too."
138305,1,"The Cloud b products really are fantastic. My children love their Twilight Turtle, and he often sleeps with them (so much for stars on the ceiling). The automatic turn-off after 45 minutes is great, the soft feet are great, the lights are bright and the children can change the color easily with the touch of a button. It's true that you can't see the constellations unless it's up on a dresser and in the middle of the room, but my children don't care, they just like the stars. If the lights start to dim (generally one or two of the colors dim or stop working), 95% of the time it's just because the (3 AAA) batteries need to be changed (no, I'm not a genius, I did actually think the bulbs were going out at one point and tried to access them...nope, just needed to change the batteries). After that, good as new! We've had ours for three years, and it's still going strong! Great gift for newborns through toddlers."
20791,1,"These work very well, they are quick and easy. Only downfall is your items turn colors but I don't believe it affects the function of the item. I'd recommend them to a friend!"
35943,0,this carrier is not so great. I bought it for the versatile carrying positon but is stuck in the front carrier position only. The wrap is way to long when you take it off so i cut a few inches off mine. I can never do the back carrying postion I want to do because my husband don't know how to put the baby on. When wearing it even in the winter I was very hot. Then my 10 month old was as well. its okay i would rather have something else.
110057,2,"I did a lot of research before purchasing this seat for my 1 year-old who outgrew his safe seat step 1. The seat is big and bulky which is what I expected from reading the reviews. The issues I had with the seat is that the even though I pulled and tugged to tighten the straps they would not tighten enough for my liking safety wise. Then because the straps would not tighten enough the chest clip kept sliding down and the straps would be slipping off of his shoulder. I am disappointed because the safe seat step 1 was awesome no complaints at all. I liked how easy the cover could come off for cleaning purposes. I loved the recline and how easy it was to install, but the clip that you use behind the seat to ensure that the seat belt stayed where placed would not lay down flat it kept popping up which defeats the purpose of making the seat belt stays nice and snug. So long story made short, because it would not safely secure my son I returned it and purchased a Graco Nautilis which can go to 100lbs and change into a booster, he loves it he is so much more comfortable in it and fell asleep in it on his first ride, he also can reach his cup holder and his secret compartments as well. It is more expensive but worth it because it converts into a booster and hopefully will be his last car seat."
158246,2,"I bought this sling when I was still pregnant. After my son was born I tried putting him in it but he just didn't seem secure, so i threw it in the back of the closet. When he turned one, I dug it out again, thinking it would work well as a hip carrier,but it is even worse for this! I had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful. First of all, the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone, it is very painful with a heavier baby. I took him out of it and will never touch the thing again."
102263,2,"I recently bought the double snap n go, intending to use Graco Snugride Car Seats wtih it. I haven't bought the car seats yet, but I brought the Snap N Go to Babies R Us to try them out. The front seat ""locked in"" fairly securely, but the rear one would not lock in. I called Baby Trend customer service, and the response was that only the Baby Trend car seats are designed to lock in. That makes no sense to me - why would they say that Graco car seats fit in if they don't??I've read many reviews from people, and some people talked about the same problem, some people say they fixed the problem, and some people say their Gracos fit great! Please respond if you can shed any light onto this matter."
100791,2,"I have used a wide variety of diapers (Huggies, Earth's Best, Target) and these by far are the poorest quality. They have a low threshold as far as how much liquid it can hold before they start to leak. My daughter wakes up completely wet whenever she is wearing Pampers, but not when she's wearing another brand. In addition, the tape on these diapers is not great, so the diaper often comes undone by itself, which can create quite a mess at an inopportune time."
99936,1,I had cruisers for my son until I saw the new 'flex' in baby dry...Have no problems till date...I compared once the cruiser and the flex baby dry side by side.. There wasn't any obvious difference..So I have been continuing with Babydry.And it's cheaper than Cruisers :)Amazon is great.. I just plan a little ahead and order online..
95460,1,This is awesome! I would have gladly paid 2 or 3 times the asking price! It's very big and sturdy and was easy to install. We have probably 40-50 stuffed animals in this thing. It's SO awesome having a place to neatly store the dolls while not in use. High recommend.
69645,2,Mom's and Dad's do not buy this pack and play. I opened the package excited to set this up and right away I noticed how cheap it was. Then the worst part the middle brack was longer than the ones on either side of it... so the pack and play was not level and rocked. Sooooo unsafe. I called the company and they told me to call Amazon and return it. I'm so mad about this. The worst part was trying to put it back in the box. DO NOT BUY THIS!
142616,1,"A lactation consultant recommended this pillow to me and it was one of the best investments we've made! I have a boppy, too, and the MBF was a little more expensive, but in the first weeks of nursing...well worth it! It fits around any size waist and I loved that I could walk around with the pillow in place when necessary! We used the MBF exclusively for at least the first month. Then when we became a little more coordinated we were able to use the boppy as well.JUST DON'T dry the cover in the dryer! Yikes! It is hard to find a replacement cover and when you do they are nearly as expensive as buying another pillow. But that was my own fault!It is nice having this pillow and the boppy. We didn't use the boppy much at first, but now one is our upstairs/stay at home pillow and the other is the downstairs/take along in the car pillow!"
172055,1,I can't tell you how awesome this tub has been for my newborn. The hammock feature is terrific for the first few months and when you are sponge bathing. I am going to be giving this to all I know who are having children.This is about an important to me as having a boppie pillow!!
61919,1,"I started out using Huggies Pull ups with my 2 year old son but they are stiff and scratchy against his skin and he won't keep them on, They run really small also, I bought a 2-3T and they hardly covered his bottom. I moved to Pampers easy ups and He loves them, They are so soft and comfortable and although I wish they had the Velcro sides, I haven't had a problem with them tearing on us, It does make diaper changes easier though, So I am going to keep asking Pampers to add them. I did go to a larger size to prevent from Night time leaks. Huggies always leaked and the lining always felt wet in the morning."
127600,2,"Positives, cradle is easy to put together and it gets the job done for the baby to fall asleep.. Negatives it is very flemsey when I would rock the cradle I realized the screws on the bottom of the legs were always coming Loose causing it to be flemsey and I had to tighten it all the time. I ended buying nuts to put on the bottom 4 screws so it wouldn't get loose and stay tighten, so far so good it's still a little flemsy but it's way better then how I had it before. I would of thought it be way better for the price i paid for it but oh well, like I said gets the job done."
96605,2,"My husband brought this home for me as I suddenly needed a pump due to a medical need to pump and dump for a day or two. I was very grateful, but soon discovered that it made me very sore. And, it didn't seem to pull much out. My hands tired quickly (I used to have a Medela hand pump and it wasn't any where near as tiring as this one is.) As I still had my Pump 'n Style, but had thrown away all the pieces since I didn't think I needed them, I found the replacement parts at a medical supply store and used that instead (Incidently, the replacement parts only cost about a dollar more than the pump did at Target, though if I'd had to have purchased a new Medela, it would have been twice as much). While even the Pump 'n Style didn't help me pump much more than this one, it was so much more comfortable and less tiring. So, for the money, if you really only need this for a short time, it might work, but if you'll need it longer, I really recommend avoiding this one unless you really don't have a choice."
151428,1,"I purchased this gate and got it the very next day. I just love it. it has the swinging door that allows you to walk through it, while after you go through it, it closes, it locks sturdy enough to stay secure, so that even the most energetic child can't get through it, even with the most shaking power of the door part. I have a two year old grandson who can't even challenge this one, and he is all over the place. He tries so hard to shake it open and he cant do it no matter how hard he tries.I bought this for a larger hallway opening where you can get to other rooms and the steps from there, and I sure don't want him to get to the steps and have an accident from a fall, this keeps him out of those areas just perfectly. The metal construction is very durable and perfect for different size openings and will certainly last a long time. I recommend this one for anyone who has small children, this is a keeper and won't fall apart easily. Well worth every penny spent. will purchase more in the future."
35920,2,"I bought this product when my daughter was about one month old because she was too small for the tradtional carriers. It looked really great in the pictures, but when you put it on it just squeezes you in all the wrong places. My main complaint though was that my baby didn't take to it as much as I would have hoped and I might have tried harder to get her used to it, but the darn thing was so time consuming and complicated to put on that it just didn't seem worth it. My advice to parents looking for a great baby carrier is to get a tradtional cloth sling. I found mine online for less money, it's easy to use, just as versatile as this product and my daughter loves it. I carry her in it everywhere I go."

55031,0,"At first I thought this was a great seat. It's cute, it matches my daughter's bathroom, and it fit my toilet perfectly. I would raise the seat and put it directly on my toilet so it wouldn't be too high for her. It was very stable and wouldn't move around at all. Once I realized my daughter was ready for full potty training, we started to use the seat constantly. She did a great job going to the potty in the beginning. She wouldn't complain or anything - she'd RUN to the bathroom for potty time! Soon however, I noticed she was uncomfortable and cried whenever it was potty time. I tried different things to get her to go, like painting her finger and toe nails, reading to her, singing, giving her little pieces of a Hershey's bar (her favorite) as a reward - nothing worked. She didn't like pottying anymore. On the third day of her potty training, I noticed two red ""carpet-like"" burns on the inside of her thighs. Well no wonder! I think the problem was a combination of two things; she's petite (25 months old, 24"" tall & 24 lbs.) and the way she sat on the seat. I think the width of the duck's head might've had something to do with it too. Whatever the reason, the seat quickly lost its appeal. I replaced it with a Munchin Deluxe Potty seat and that did the trick. My daughter is back to pottying - comfortably!This seat is really cute, has some pretty great ratings, and both kids & parents seem to like it. It just didn't work for us and I thought I should share that problem with other parents. In my opinion, this seat isn't made for petite toddlers!"
99676,0,"Still the great diapers we've grown to expect from Pampers, but I wish there was some way of knowing whether or not the diapers possessed the wetness detector strip. I'm neither used to nor fond of the squeeze test, so I much prefer the visual (in addition to the inevitable vocal) signs."
136530,1,Product was delievered in perfect condition with all pieces. The only issue we had was the door on the tower didn't seem to align well at first but now it opens and closes easily after using it several times. It looks beautiful. Great price! I would recommend to a friend.
135726,1,"I am so glad I tried these bottles! I didn't really think they would make a differece but they did. My 5 week old son would squirm and spit up after a feeding. When he wasn't sleeping, he would be fussing. I tried playtex and avent and assumed he would just have to outgrow his gassiness. So I was pleasantly surprised to find out Dr. Brown's worked just as they claimed to. My son eats calmly now and doesn't spit up. He seems much more comfortable and I'm very pleased!"
102419,1,"I purchased this mobile because of the reviews and because it looked bright and colorful online. I was hesitant at first because my daughters bedding is pink/brown and not a rainforest theme, however, she absolutely loves it. The moving leaves and colorful animals really draw her eyes to the unit and she will sit there and study it for seemingly forever. The music is pretty standard - classical, and it features a rainforest-like sound of crickets and frogs, birds, etc. The only feature I was disappointed in was the light. I was under the impression that the light on the main unit that attaches to the crib was more dramatic. It is just a bulb that shines light through the base. Not much to look at so my daughter really only cares about it during the day when she can actually see it. Otherwise at night, it's good for the music and rainforest sound.Anyhow, I still think this is a great mobile and would recommend it to all. Oh, and it comes with a remote activator so you can turn it on while in bed or at the nursery door! It is a nice feature."
108423,2,"I had originally written a great review for this potty seat. On first getting it, it seemed brilliant. My son loves it, but that's no surprise, it has Lightning McQueen on it..why wouldn't he love it. I loved it as it caught his pee...but here we are a few months after the initial purchase and it stinks.I clean the seat dry after every use, however the pee gets in the plastic lining of the seat and as my son has gotten heavier his weight pushes the cushioned piece down and allows some of his pee to go between the cushioned piece and the seat base. This means that you would have to take the seat apart and wash it off after every use. It's just not a practical seat.I will be looking for a better seat, as this one is unhygienic. It's unfortunate, as it seems to be the only seat that has the higher front piece suitable for little boys."

166869,1,"I love this wearable blanket. It's very soft and warm, and not static as acrylic is. I wish they made them in bigger sizes, I can't find anything like it anymore."
55013,1,"I really like this toilet ring and my son does too. not only is it cute, but it is very stable and seems to be comfortable for him. He can put it in place easily by himself, it does not slip, slide or pinch his skin and it catches any dribbles and drips. I would recommend this product."
120042,2,"My child is now 2 months old and I have been pumping breastmilk since her birth in order to build up a supply. Not only are the bags difficult to pour the milk into, they leak upon defrosting. Today was the first day that I defrosted a frozen bag of milk and soon found that it was leaking in the fridge from the seam at the bottom of the bag. I am very disappointed as I have worked hard every day in order to pump milk. I read similar reviews regarding the leaking but figured it couldn't happen with every bag, however sadly I am wrong. I wish I had used Lansinoh as their bags are thicker, more durable and priced the same as Gerber."
15352,1,We love this pillow. My daugter is 2 months old and she naps on it. It fits inside her pack and play and she lays on it for a nice long nap. It keeps her from rolling over. It also fits on the couch in between me and my husband so we can enjoy together.
2636,0,I used to use pampers all the time and then switched a while ago. I thought I would go back and try them again and found that the size 5 diapers are smaller than other brands so I didn't even get through half the box before I had to order the next size up. Not sure why but now we are doing fine with size 6 but my daycare still uses 5 in other brands and they are fine on her...
95298,0,"We bought the Sounds &amp; Lights monitor 2 yrs. ago and have been so pleased with it. We bought another set recently for our upcoming 2nd baby, and did not find that the quality has been new and improved as they claim. The units felt so lightweight and not sturdy compared to our old set. While it seemed to work fine during the day, it had a loud buzz at night when I plugged it in beside my bed, even at the very lowest volume setting. Also, the old set could take batteries in the transmitter as well as the receiver - we found this handy as we clipped the transmitter to the bassinet so it was right with the baby when we wheeled him from room to room around the house. I returned this one and found one that we liked better by Evenflo Constant Care 1500. It also takes batteries in both the transmitter &amp; receiver and is very quiet, even with the volume turned up all the way."
119984,1,"I would like to state right from the start that I've probably used this product for about 20 years (or more!) I've always loved using powder after a bath or a shower because it's a good way to stay cooler when you get out. After it was discovered that talc might be a contributing factor to cervical cancer, I decided to go with corn starch type baby powder, and have used this ever since. One thing I would like to say, in addition to what I've already stated, is that you probably could never get this large of a size anywhere else - in a store, or another website, not to mention, it is delivered right to your door. This is a HUGE consideration for me, because I'm physically disabled; don't drive, and don't get around nearly as well as I used to. And the fragrance is delicious!Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder Calming Lavender And Chamomile -- 22 oz"
125264,0,"I TRIED TO GIVE THIS FIRST TO MY TEETHING BABY BOY WHEN HE WAS 3 MONTHS OLD, HE STARTED TEETHING EARLY, BUT IT WAS SOO HUGE FOR HIS LITTLE MOUTH. SO, I TRIED IT AGAIN AT 6 MONTHS AND STILL NO GO. SO NOW HE CHEWS ON SOPHIE THE GIRAFFE AND LOVES HER. I WILL TRY IT AGAIN WHEN HIS MOUTH IS A LITTLE LARGER."
20435,0,"The main problem I have with this product is the fact that my son slumps all the way over when he falls asleep. It's the most frustrating thing because it doesn't make me feel okay that he's safe in the seat. I've tried making sure the seat belt is locked to hold him but he still falls right over and I constantly have to reach back and push him up. Also, the cup holders are not that deep to prevent cups from falling out. Also complains about his bottom hurting and he's not sitting on anything except the seat."
83642,1,My daughter was small when she was born and we had trouble latching on. The nurse went and got a nipple shield and an hour later she was eating away. I have been using this since she was born almost two months ago and I have yet to notice any decrease in my milk supply. Highly recommend this product if you have trouble latching on. Don't give up it takes time. Also this product is very thin so the baby can still smell your milk and you still feel everything that you would without using one.
74317,1,As a first time mother I have found this monitor to be perfect. I love every feature about it! I love having two receivers - one for beside the bed and one for downstairs (it keeps you from dragging a monitor around w/ you!). The fact that you can plug it in and use batteries is also really nice for when you need to go outside. This monitor bearly needs to have the volume turned on and you can hear EVERYTHING! I think if someone had problems w/ static it must be where they live. I haven't had one problem with monitor and would recommend it to everyone!!
39064,1,Cushion fits the chair nicely. Has velcro straps to keep it firmly in place. Even with wiggly bottoms like my son. Easy off easy on for easy cleaning! Toss in washing machine when needed. Great item.
159748,1,"..............A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR BABIES.....................Me and my wife are very impressed with this fisherprice kick n play bouncer. We introduced this to our 2 month old babyand gradually it became one of his favourite pal to spend time with. Ours was a blue cover with the same pattern.Some of its great features, we felt:1. Babies learn to kick earlier and seem to get their daily excercise due to this.2. Excellent vibration just as in a car to soothe the baby to sleep.3. Its sounds and lights are just rite to occupy babies attention most of the time n thus helping moms to finish up their jobs.4. The toys are unreachable initially, when the baby is not moving his hands much, but gradually as the baby gets growing he will try to reach for it which will make him althemore curious to touch the toys with his hands as well as legs. :))5. Safety belt is awesome. Always belt him.6. Easy on assembling as well as disassembling. Washable cover - a boon!7. Great to take-along on any vacation. Light on travel too."
101623,2,"I tried two of these monitors, hoping that the first was just a bad item, however when the second did the same thing, ToysRUs took it back. The box is a nightmare to get the thing out first of all, and they want you to return it in the box. The monitor clicks, and we did try this all over the house. We even unplugged our cordless phones and computers to see if that was the problem which it was not. It also jumps off channel, and leaves a horrible static sound. I did like the rechargable battery concept, the walkie talkie concept, and the ability to monitor three rooms, however it is just not worth the headaches. I did exchange this for the Sony which is amazing, as per other reviewers."
145480,1,"This rainforest jumperoo is fantastic, and great. We purchased it for our 5 month old grandson and he just loves it. He does not want to get out of it , he just jumps and giggles while in this wonderful toy . He loves trying to reach for the birds and toys and the music makes him laugh.This toy is so great."
125434,1,Great product for teethers. My baby liked the color and that she can put in her mouth and chew on it.
16685,2,"My son really likes this cup, but I found out it is made of polycarbonate plastic, which is known to be toxic. So I threw it out and bought the larger flip n' sip cups, which are made of safe polypropylene plastic. My only comlaint is that they don't have handles and are a little big. If only Nuby made a PP version of the 2 handled sip n' flip!"
8057,1,"I have tried many different creams and concoctions on my sensitive girl's bottom. Once I found this product I never looked back. The healing is very fast! It may be pricy but one 10 oz. tub lasts a really long time, even with multiple uses per day.I highly recommend this to anyone whose baby has sensitive skin and a lot of rashes."
92191,1,"Penaten Baby Powder is purr-fect! Just like all of the other Penaten products. It is no wonder that they have been around for over 100 years. Quality lasts and lasts! The powder feels like silk, and has a most gentle and ethereal scent. I like it!!! So there!!!"
117527,0,"Out of the box, the Graco Bumper Jumper hangs too low to the floor for my 6 month old baby. In order to adjust it for my little one's toes to be touching the ground, the manual instructs you to make a weird cumbersome loop that elevates it higher. However this loop doesn't remain secure and it slowly slips down to a lower, undesirable position. I'm not very happy with this product."
4551,1,"ITEM CAME JUST AS PICTURED, FAST SHIPPING AND GREAT QUALITY! LOOKS GREAT ON MY DAUGHTER'S DOOR...WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING TO FIND A GREAT QUALITY LETTERS FOR A GREAT PRICE!"
73729,1,I have now given this to three different new moms. Each one has found this to be the greatest item that they never knew existed. Buy it! You'll love it!
86158,1,After returning the Safety 1st one for poor reception and nothing but problems for $200. We decided to pick this one up due to it's good reviews here. We are very pleased with our purchase. Product works as advertised!!
24837,1,"I have a puggle and boxer, and neither one can jump this gate or accidentally open it. It's the best gate I've ever owned- and I've gone through a LOT of gates!! It is so easy to install- did it myself and I'm not usually good at putting things together. Easy!! Great when I'm taking groceries in the house and don't have an extra hand to fiddle with one of those tricky gate locks. LOVE IT!!! It doesn't leave ""marks"" on the trim or ""damage"" the walls... some reviewers must be over-tightening their gates if they're having that much trouble. It also has NEVER shifted out of place- ever... and I've had it in a high traffic area (where it's used over and over throughout the day)for nearly 3 months. Great gate- worth the money!"
9049,2,"Ignoring the multitude of negative reviews on Amazon, I purchased this for our child. This CD player is a complete waste of money. First, the sound is so low at maximum volume that it is audible only in the very quietest of times. No screaming baby is going to be even touched by its effect - which defeats the major purpose of calming a baby. Second, the player is so designed that if you have a sleeper other than a crib with slats, the sound will be completely muffled, worsening its already low volume. Third, the system of hooking the player onto the crib rail is iffy at best. A small knock and it will fall off, either onto the infant or the floor. Fourthly, the unit visibly and tangibly vibrates when playing a cd. It is flabbergasting that a reputed company like ""The First Years"" could market such a disappointment. This CD player is going back to Amazon, even though I will have to pay for S&H both ways."
39815,0,"People buy these types of products mainly to assist with sleeping. Recently my HomeMedics sound machine died and I went on Amazon to find another one. I found a plethura of these devices in all price ranges. I finally decided on this product as the price was right, and it had the sounds I wanted.Overall, it does what it is supposed to do. There are even 4 'mix' tones so that you can have 'Rain' playing, and add in bird sounds, thunder, etc. That's a nice touch.On the flip side, the unit's volume is too low. Even at the top setting you can still hear ambient noise around you. The other unit I had was so loud on the higher volumes that I never turned it all the way up. This one I put on Max all the time, and even then it's about half the volume of the HomeMedics unit I had.It's a decent machine, probably more suited to background noise in a less then hectic enviroment, or perhaps for a child. For those that need it to provide a sound zone to sleep in, it is flawed."
111038,1,"I love the color and pattern of this nursing cover, it is not as eye catching as others on the market. The adjustable strap and bending wire at the top works nicely. The only problem I find is that the sides cannot be well covered. I would be nice if the cover could be wider, and perhaps designed to wrap around the sides."
129788,1,"We bought this bed after a lot of toddler bed research. My husband wasn't going to put our daughter in just any bed, so we spent many hours researching different brands and styles. This is the one we chose and we are so glad we did. It went together so easily! Its very sturdy and looks great! Our daughter is so excited with her new ""big girl bed""! I would recommend it to anyone."
125917,1,"This size is a great value. The 1-2 size is perfect for my 2 month old that is around 12lbs. We have used Pampers and Huggies and like them both. Huggies are a little bulkier, but do a great job keeping him dry."
119489,2,"This product was a big disappointment. The static is so bad that we can barely hear our son crying and to get the lights to even go to the second level he has to be crying histerically. Also, you basically have to have the monitor in the bed with him so he can see the projection on the ceiling. The only good thing I have found about this product is that you can turn the music on without going in the room, but when you do turn the music on you really cannot hear your child at all. I would highly recommend going with another product."
170266,1,"We got this crib because our daughters room was too cold this winter and she had to sleep upstairs with me instead of in her own room (which is fine because she isn't even 1 yet). We didn't want to move her BIG crib upstairs, so we decided to order a mini crib. This DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!! I would recommend this to anyone for a second crib or even if they have s small living space. It is a great quality and baby has enjoyed it immensely. We did order a separate mattress for it because the one it comes with is more like a pad then a mattress. Also, being a mini crib, you will probably need to buy mini crib sheets and bumper off of Amazon (they aren't available at my local stores). Can't go wrong with purchasing this item!!"
173531,2,"The swing is great - if you only plan on using it for one child. It worked really well for our first and was considered a lifesaver at many points. After he outgrew it, the swing was put in our storage room for about a year. When we got it out for a second child, it was a let down. The ""mobile"" part of the swing works fine, as well as the music. It does not, however, actually swing. Isn't that the reason you buy a swing? I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone planning on using it for multiple children."
156738,1,"We bought the Ultrasaucer for Matthew when he was 5 months (he's going on 7 now) and I have to say he LOVES it. The support in the bucket chair is great. He loves to chew on pretty much every part especially the orange zig zaggy thing. He bangs on the horns to hear the music. The only thing I was concerned about was the castle. I read a review where someones son hurt there head on it. So far I haven't had a problem but being a new mom, I do take it off occasionally."
152622,1,"This Gund giraffe Comfy Cozy is a wonderful gift for a child. It is soft & so huggable - I want to carry it around!It can be a little blanket for a baby to lay on, or, like for my 1 year old, a lovie to carry around & take to bed.I highly recommend this sweet giraffe for any infant or little child, you can't miss with this gift!"
119716,0,"This is not a monitor I would recommend. It is so unclear, all I hear is static and a clicking noise the whole time it is on. When I actually do hear my baby it's not clear at all, I can't tell if she's crying or if she coughed or what. I do like the light show and the music it plays. That is a really nice feature but I bought it for a monitor not for a toy. I am going to bring it back tomorrow and buy a different brand."
23796,1,With my first child her swaddling always came undone when she was carried or being passed around to friends and family. Later she kicked off her blankets when in her crib. My 2nd daughter is currently 4 months old. I got lots of use out of it when she was a newborn for swaddling and have brought it out again now that she has started rolling over and kicking her blankets off. It was really the onlt blanket I used to cover/wrap her. She is average length and it still fits her but is getting small at the armholes. I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice if it were slightly larger so it could be used longer. I will definitely purchase the next size.I have read the other review that mentioned the swaddler wrap getting bunched up around the neck and face. This never happened when we used it and I can't imagine how it happened to them. I always wrapped my daughters arms accross her chest because she liked to suck her fingers. Perhaps wrapping the arms down too far caused this?
150668,1,"I am so happy with this purchase! The price was reasonable and it's a surprisingly nice piece. The color is exactly what i expected, it's sturdy, and the drawers slide nicely. My husband put it together though, so I can't really comment on that aspect. Really glad we ordered this!"
178801,1,I bought this for my 4th granddaughter who turns 3 months old this May 6th. Both my two daughters have two babies each. They are all breast fed babies who love to cuddle close to mom. My daughters believe hugging their babies all the time make them happy children when they grow up. I believe it too. Both of my daughters had tried the other brand of carrier but found out this is the best and the easiest to use baby carrier. I use it too when I was babysitting them and it is the best invention ever made for grandmothers too.
155365,0,"These corner cushions are cheap, so don't expect much. They'll do the job for now, but I'm sure I'll be replacing them soon enough. The 2 sided tape that comes with is a major PAIN [..]to peel apart, and the foam corner is actually two pieces glued together, with glue smeared all over the inside. Not worth the hassle, I recommend a better product."
59981,0,"We bought this because of all the positive reviews, but clearly we should have spent more time looking at the less than stellar reviews. I just opened this and it's a behemoth. On what planet can you hang this on the back of a door? If you have ANY STORAGE space issues at all, this is not the tub for you. You couldn't hang this anywhere in your living space without it being on the way somehow. It's very deep so I just can't see how you could put it behind a door (except perhaps a door to a basement). We've to return it because there is just no room in our condo to store it."
146829,1,"These ""stickers"" are fantastic. They stick to the wall, even our weird, textured walls, and peel right off when you are ready to take them down or move them around... without leaving any sort of residue behind.We have used these ""stickers"" as potty training bribes, chore rewards and treasure box prizes. They're great. My boys (three and five) love them. They especially like that they get to decorate their own space. We let them decorate the walls around the head of their beds.Whenever the boys have friends over, one of the first things they show their guests are their ""stickers."" They are very proud of them.I bought every set I could find on Amazon. Star Wars, all the superheroes, the Toy Story series and I'm sure there are a few more in there. Half the fun is watching the boys pick out the sticker they want. We're running low on stickers... I hope more characters pop up soon."
67725,1,Product is just adorable. What a great idea. We are not having a cake at my daugther's baby shower (just a waste of food) so this will take the place of a real cake.
147846,1,"This stroller cover is great! We have a Safety 1st stroller and it fits perfectly. Since it has a zipper on it, it should be able to fit almost any stroller you have. We are very pleased with this product and would recommend it ."
137616,2,"This is a great idea...a gorgeous, cute toy WHEN IT WORKS...The first one we got for my Granddaughter for Christmas worked for approximately 30 minutes....and died...the second...did not work AT ALL...MAJOR disappointment for all, especially after seeing what it COULD do if it worked decently...don't waste your time, your money , or your child's anticipation on this DUD of a toy/light!"
155887,1,"You can get it nice and cold in the freezer and it's got lots of places for them to hold and bite. My only wish is that the fingers weren't spaced so evenly as our daughter would need to put two fingers in at once. She didn't mind, but it didn't look all the comfortable."
44695,2,"IF you read the ingredients you'll notice there are pthalates and paraben and dangerous artificial colors!!! HOW DO THEY GET AWAY WITH CALLING THEMSELVES ORGANIC?! Amazon should be ashamed of themselves, supporting such a falsely advertised product! I would NOT use this on myself, but especially on my kids. TERRIBLE."
171387,2,i read the reviews on this and I disagree with most people.. i think the tub looks very uncomfortable and I have to hold onto my baby with one hand while I wash him cause he is always scooting around and he slides easily. i think for when they are younger the cheap sponge ones are easier to use. and by the time they can sit up.. just put them in the actual tub.
16398,1,"This blanket works great on wet grass or damp beach and is so so convenient. It's one of the best baby items I bought! Folds super easy, cleans up wonderfully -- highly recommend it for moms on the go! I keep this in my car and am always picnic-ready :)"
95007,0,I started pumping in earnest everyday for since January when i returned to work. The pump works well however the condensation in the tube which sounded like an exception in the instructions happened from the first and every pumping session since and it is a real hassle to dry out. i dont even bother to try to dry it anymore. And milk gets sucked into the tube occasionally for no reason. That is a real hassle to clean and it wets the battery compartment. Those are design flaws Medela should work on. Other than that it pumps fast enough (15 mins per breast excluding stimulation phase)and is painless.
21096,2,"I have a 4 month old and have tired numerous diapers. Ive tried Pampers Swaddlers, Pampers Baby-Dry, Huggies UltraTrim....NONE of which I recommend and most especially Huggies Supreme. Many of my daughters clothes have been stained due to the lack of absorbtion of ""#2"". The diaper is very deceiving. It seems like it fits nicely but on the back side of the diaper the ""absorbant strip ends leaving a gap for the poop to leak thru and then even worse leak up and out!!! The poop used to get all over my daughter's back!! I would literally have to JUMP out of bed when I heard her making poop and lift her up so that it would get all over the crib. Then when I would change her I found that her poop didn't absord anywhere in the diaper. It was just a puddle of poop. Sorry for being so graphic but I want you all to get the picture so you don't waste your money! The smae thing happened with the Huggies Ultratrim....BIG WASTE OF $$$!!!!! I have finally fould the best diaper EVER....Pampers Cruisers! They can get a little pricey but they are SO TOTALLY worth it when you think of how much you spend on those cute outfits and bedding. The absorbtion is GREAT, unlike any other!!"
10052,2,"Not impressed and am returning tomorrow. The little wings you have to dial out barely hold the seat in place. Maybe it works for older toilets or german toilets...but not mine. If the little wings came down more, then it would hook under the lip of the seat. But this will be returned. Got it at babies r us and I will just look for a permanent seat that won't fly off while my kid is getting on or off of it."
9554,1,"This is a great potty chair. I had a Safety 1st potty chair/step stool combo chair that didn't work out because my son likes to dump the potty by himself and in order to do that he had to lift the chair apart and then pull out the bowl. It was always messy. This chair is wonderful in that the bowl fits nicely on top of the seat so he just lifts it straight up and out and is able to dump it easily. With the Safety 1st model and others, there are lots of spots and crevices under the bowl where the spills get caught. This Bjorn potty chair is simply constructed so it is easy to clean."
149523,1,"don't leak, don't overfill, don't slip off.We tried others - discounters and nationals - this is baby 3 and we use what works."
115426,0,"My daughter loves the seat because it's Dora, and it works OK. Doesn't fit on our toilet well. It slips and moves around."
39154,2,"We purchased this based on the positive reviews; however, we were surprised when we ended up with a hole after it's third flight. I don't know how much traveling people are doing with this, but after less than a year and 7 flights, I don't think we'll be able to use it again. It's ripping on a seam and the fabric is sporting several little holes."
21593,1,"We bought this bouncer after having the ocean aquariums bouncer. It has a nice deep seat, and a nice size strap on piece in the front (the ocean aquarium's is too short and too small). It bounces better than our other bouncer; the metal frame it sits on is designed the opposite way of other bouncers, therefore, i think, giving it a better bounce when the baby moves. As for the features, I originally thought all of the extra attachments were unnecessary. But my baby loves them! She loves the bee rattle, and loves the overhead mirror/mobile! One drawback. There is no padding down by the frame where the babies kick their feet, so they are kicking on the hard metal frame. So I stuffed it with some padding. But this bouncer was made with a lot of thought, and it shows. Now if they could only make a collapsible one like this with a 25lb weight limit or higher..."
181619,1,"This bag is great for running errands. Now that my daughter is 6 mos old, I don't need the very large diaper bag I originally received as a shower gift. This one holds an extra change of clothes, diapers and wipes, a few toys, my keys, wallet and cell phone and a changing pad. It fits comfortably when worn and also fits nicely across the bars of my stroller. I haven't had any trouble with it ripping, but I don't try to overstuff it either. All in all well worth the money I paid for it."
153419,2,"I hate this stroller. I researched strollers forever and KNEW this was the stroller for me. What I didn't realize (as a first time parent) was how huge it was and how much that would impact my daily life. If I was only using this stroller for going on bike paths and hiking trails, it might be great, but for getting around in day-to-day life, it is awful. The back two wheels are so wide that there are literally stores that I cannot walk through. The storage underneath is a little lacking, but that didn't bother me so much. I also had a wobble in the stroller that bothered me a lot. I wrote to the customer service department and they told me how to tighten a nut under the front tire and that they hoped that would fix the problem. I'll give it a try and see if that works, but if I had known what I was doing in the first place, I would never have gotten this stroller. :( Live and learn..."
120435,1,"Absolutely love this product. I can finally sleep at night without worrying if the baby has stopped breathing. My four month old will only sleep on his stomache, and this has been a life saver for us!!!"
70403,1,"I have used Huggies for all 3 of my kids. They are my favorite brand, and trust me, I've tried them all. They are the best value &amp; have the best fit. I think Pampers run smaller. I have never had a leakage problem with Huggies unless I forgot to change for several hours! Yes, they do leak the gel -- IF you forget! No gel leakage if diaper is changed regularly. They are not the nicest diapers as far as being &quot;clothlike,&quot; but those diapers are much more expensive, of course. For your money, these are the best."
105143,1,"We love this diaper pail. When I was looking for a diaper pail before my daughter was born, I know that I didn't want a diaper genie - hard to use, need two hands, and expensive refills. The diaper champ seemed like the perfect solution and so far it works like, well a ""champ"". No smells, easy one-handed use and uses your standard tall kitchen garbage bags. It also holds quite a few diapers - at least 20 #2 diapers. Granted we haven't started solid foods yet, so I'm not sure about the smell factor there, but what diaper pail really truly eliminates every odor? I highly recommend this product and two friends who are having babies in the next few months have registered for it on my advice."
45004,1,"My 5 month old boys love their Gymnis. They grab at the toys, love looking in the mirror, love the lights and music. It's a great toy! It folds in half and tucks away nicely. Machine washable, too."
49836,0,"I originally bought this because my refrigerator door wouldn't stay closed (crappy apartment, cheap fridge) and we were constantly ruining food because of it. Install was simple (with the exception that I put the latch on a little further back than I would have preferred and now we really have to push the door closed really hard for it to latch - be careful with that one!), and it's working great. I've had it on for about a month now and it shows no sign of falling off (as some other reviewers said) - it is SOLID. It takes a little while to get used to, but any door latch would.Update 4/19/12 - the adhesive isn't so great, and the arm broke. Not that great... but if you don't mind changing it every 4-6 months then it's fine!"
151429,1,I have bought several gates and they were a hassle to install. This gate was so easy and works great.It shipped real fast and I am thrilled with my new gate.
22292,1,I didn't want my daughter to have to pack up every time my Grandon came over and this pack and play with the firm mattress added was perfect. Easy up and down and to travel with.
92954,1,We took this to the beach and my grandson loved it. It was his bed during the vacation. Now it is his rest and watch a movie bed. He can put it up and take it down himself. I wish it was a little bigger so he could use it a few more years (he's five) but he has a younger brother and it will get lots more use.
67021,1,This piggy bank is very cute but also very small. Perfect decoration though for a Winnie the Pooh room
87219,1,The one thing that I would say this bottle has an advantage over the Avent bottles is warming breastmilk - (because you are not supposed to microwave breastmilk because it loses a lot of nutrients). All you have to do is pour the milk in the bottle and cap it and stick it in a cup of hot tap water. The milk warm in minutes! My son does great with this bottle when I'm away and can't nurse him (although to him there is nothing like the real thing).
68404,1,This is just too cute for words! We've gotten so many compliments on how cute our nursery is!
105157,1,"I did a lot of research into all of the products we purchased for our baby, reading opinions, talking to friends with children, etc. I feel like we made a great choice with this diaper pail. What I like the most is the fact you can use any bag you want. I purchased a roll of vanilla scented bags at Target and I have barely made a dent in them. (My daughter is 3 1/2 months old). I also had a problem with the diaper tabs getting caught in the shoot and clogging things up. Once I realized the problem I just made sure to wrap up the diapers and secure them shut with the tabs, problem solved. I have not had any problems with odor. We are feeding with formula so we definitely have some ripe diapers, but once they are in the pail the odor is contained. We change the bag every 2-3 days (which seems reasonable to me) and with each change I Lysol out the inside of the pail. No odor problems at all. I think the pail is easy to use and I have had no problems opening the pail to change the bags. After using other brands at friends' homes I feel this pail is easier, and more importantly, cheaper to use."
30535,1,"This was a gift for my son (3rd child). He loves it, it gives great support for a squirmy baby, and I LOVE the pillow head rest. The middle of the tub is raised for them to sit on in a reclined position, it works best when you release the foot end of the mesh hammock. It comes with 2 scoops, perfect for rinsing baby's hair and chest and a soft plastic arched connector to attach the scoops to (or teethers and such) for baby to play with. Also good for attaching the scoops if you air your tub out standing up. My son is pretty big (15 lbs at 2 months) so I don't think he'll be able to use it for very long. The only flat part of the tub for sitting up and bathing is very small. There aren't very many pics posted of babies sitting up in the tub, probably for that very reason. That would be my only complaint (-1 star), but he's got siblings, so as soon as he sits up he'll be bathing in the ""big"" tub with them anyway."
11714,1,"I purchased this tub while I was visiting relatives for the holidays. We had the big bulky plastic tub at home and I didn't want to bring it. Unfortunatley, my 11 month old daughter wasn't yet ready for the &quot;Big Tub&quot; and we ran into a crisis. I was torn on what to get. There are so many tubs out there. We bought this one because it can deflate. I knew we could carry it back home with us when we went. It turned out to be wonderfull!! She's not scared. It's cushioned for comfort. It even has a high back so you can lean them back and rinse their hair. It is just too easy. I came home and threw the other one away."
140533,1,Swing was received within 2 days of ordering. Love the free shipping. Assembly not too difficult. Quality product and my grandson loves it. Thank you Amazon.com.
4274,1,"We purchased this product for our Bugaboo stroller after reading the good reviews. The product fits quite well, it isn't as loose as what other reviewers say it is. I like that it has a small pocket, where I put my cell phone, then a zipped pocket for my wallet. The cup holders are tiled, so you can't put a full cup of coffee in there, it may spill, but anything bottled wil be fine. I like that it doesn't stick out, so when we fold the stroller it's easy."
125926,1,"I haven't had any problems with these diapers. My daughter is much more sensitive to Pampers, Luvs, or generic brands which can sometimes lead to more rash/redness. After the newborn stage, Huggies Snug & Dry are definitely preferred in my house!"
109443,1,A little expensive for such a low tech thingy but it works. easy to clean as well. won't have to worry about baby chocking any more
140524,0,"Make sure that you receive a completely unopened package if you buy this. If you do not report your concerns within 7 days then the seller will deny any responsibility when it comes to broken/defective products. You need to open this swing up IMMEDIATELY when you receive it because those 7 days start when it arrives, not when it is opened.Do you notice that the engine grinds loudly? Send it back. It will break within a month.Do you notice that one of the ends has been taped back together? Send it back. Most likely the previous person Amazon sent it to opened it and heard it grinding loudly. It will break within a month.Unopened box and quiet motor? Keep it, this is a good swing! While not a substitute for a good nap or a strong set of arms, this swing can give me 10-15 minutes of quiet time in order to write an email, do the dishes, or get dinner in the oven. My little 6 week old seems to really enjoy the fact that the chair rotates 360 degrees; offering a change of views and a change of swinging (front/back vs. side to side) without me having to physically pick the entire thing up and move it around. Keep the sun out of his eyes.I can see myself easily giving this product a 1 star on account of a defective motor, the vendor, and how the product arrived, but trying to remain objective about the direct usefulness of this product (when it is working), I feel like it rates at about a 3 or a 3.5 on the ""keep him occupied and comfortable while I do other things"" scale."
137926,1,I purchased this for my mentally challenged adult nephew when he was recovering from surgery. He loved it. I haven't seen it but I heard it was a hit.
140717,1,"Keeps the pups in the back when I 'm driving, easy to install, easy to see through. Great price. I would highly recommend."
150412,1,"I have 2 hampers that I loved, one serves me over 20 years and another one over 10 years. This go back to good old days when things make very sturdy, even it does cost a bit, but for the time I had them, that was worth it. They still standing nicely, but over the years color does fade a little, so I have been search replacements. But all those newer ones all gone to other households, I did not want to keep them, just not up to my standard.I saw this one last year from other website, I almost order it, but even with discount when I get two, the cost just way too high. I was very happy when I found this at Amazon, I don't even have to order 2 or more, the price already much lower (plus free shipping). I just got the blue one today, it was just what I expected- ""Sturdy"", not the mention Cute! I am so happy with it, I order a pink one right away. Since this is for baby, the size is smaller then your regular size hampers. My intention is for spare one or future gift, just in case they are out of stocks. My search continues, but now I can take my time.8/2010I did not have luck with my Pink one. The first one came was damaged, even the hamper was sturdy (top and bottom), but the frame made of heavy paper board, it was bend badly in large area. I had to returned it and 2nd one was loss in transit, I had to contact Amazon to send me another replacement. The 3rd one came, but looks a returned item, vinyl interior bag been used. I had no more energy to deal with it anymore, contacted Amazon and received a small comp. for not return it. So far I have not find a better item at this price range, I do not know I should try again, but this one is going to one of my friend's house for sure. I am not going to keep it."
145358,1,"My 5 month old absolutely loves this. Definitely worth the money. I wish Fisher Price would make a rainforest walker. Easy to assemble, easy to keep clean and loads of fun. You will not be disappointed."
53281,1,"Even though at the time my little girl was 2 months, Its at the stage where she wants to play and stand up now! I loved the product the 1st time I went looking for items to scan, for my showers. The product works best when she asleep because, all babies want someone to rock them right! So I put her in while she's asleep and she sleeps peacefully while I clean up. I would refer this product to any new mom!"
129878,1,I can pick-up my grand baby with ease. No changing the base out of one car to another. Price was fair too.
70204,1,This diaper stacker coordinates with the Dream Hug Love collection. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It is a beautiful addition to baby's room. We definitely recommend it.
156538,1,This swing was one of the best baby gifts i recieved! my son has been able to use it since he was about 3 weeks old...he fall asleep in it and everything. I also agree the music kinda stinks but he loves it lol & falls asleep to it so i guess I can't complain! The toys are great & OF COURSE interchangable! They can never get bored w/that! the only slight downside is once your baby starts getting heavier it doesn't swing as fast but it's still great...
31709,1,"I always have this brush on hand. The sponge part lasts a bit longer than other brands, and I like the fact that it stands up so wsell to dry."
42144,1,"At first I registered for the &quot;typical&quot; ugly baby hamper, then I saw this one on-line and switched my choice right away! It is really stylish and practical. I like that I can remove the mesh to carry to the washing machine. I also like that it holds a lot of clothes. The mesh is washable when necessary to avoid smells. The only thing I am not satisfied with is that the feet are a bit crooked and I can't straighten them out."
141141,1,My 9 month twins like to play with the front panel of this toy but I have to lean it up against something to keep it from rolling. It rolls away from them and they fall over. This toy would be much better if it had brakes.
156592,2,"I bought this swing because my 3 month old son is in love with the Ocean Aquarium Cradle Swing, which he sleeps in for 4-6 hours at a time. So, I thought I should get a portable swing to take along with me to grandmas house. Well, as soon as I put him in there, the seat tipped all the way back and he nearly slid out head first. The belt is too loose and the speed of the swing drove him nuts. It was shaking him, not swinging him. The music is obnoxious and stringy, not soothing. I havent had any problems with any other products except this one. I was hesitating to rate this, but it was that bad. Im going to exchange it for the Aquarium take along swing and see if it is as wonderful as the larger cradle swing."
130178,2,"Well, when we first purchased this swing, we loved it and so did the baby. Yes, it was a bit powerful for a newborn, but our son seemed to like the intensity. Yes, it was noisy, but I learned to live with that and yes, it was ugly, but since it did receive good reviews we bought it anyway. The swing eats batteries like crazy and after 6 weeks it stopped swinging all together and my son is only 13 1/2 pounds. So, we called Fisher Price and their customer service was fantastic, we received a new motor in less then a week. My husband installed the new motor two nights ago and as of this mornig the swing isn't working AGAIN.The idea of this swing is great, but I would never recommend it. Also, I agree with some of the other reviews, PLEASE make an AC adapter for these items!!!!***Update. Apparently, it was just the fastest setting that wasn't working on the second motor. We have been much happier with this swing since receiving the new motor. I still think there are some things that could be improved, but overall it's better then average."
178298,1,"This bag is a great combination of functionality and cuteness. It holds everything I need for everyday trips to the store, or even day trips to places like the aquarium. The messenger style makes it super easy to carry, especially with baby on your hip. It also attaches to your stroller, so you do not have to struggle with trying to get it in and out of your stroller basket. The colors are great as they go well with my black stroller, but have the right touches of pink for my little princess. And since the bag is not overly girly, my husband doesn't mind carrying it, either. Overall, this a great bag for everyday use, even when doubling as my purse. But it will not fit your baby's entire room, as it is not one of those monstrous diaper bags, which I also love. My last one was just too big, so I always ended up bringing way too much stuff just because it would fit. This bag forces me to narrow it down, but with all of the compartments, there is enough room for everything that baby and I need."
38307,1,I love this safer bather. It is soft on baby's back and keeps her in place. I've not had a problem with it starting to smell like mildew. I just wring it out after every bath and hang it up to dry. Now that she's older (7 months) she doesn't sit still any more but I will use it with next baby.
117865,1,"Ordered this table for my 3 yo (and her little sister to use with her when she is older). She loves it and goes straight to it for projects and activities. Love the storage bin in the middle and I change it's contents periodically.I added removable place mats so it is easier to clean when she colors or uses play-doh. It is durable and great for what we were looking for.Yes-it took a while to put together, but that should be expected."
91429,0,I've had these monitors since my daughter was born in April '04 and they worked great till we moved about 3 weeks ago. We now live 5 miles away from a very busy international airport and right in the flight line.... whenever a plane passes ove all i get is static... however once the plane has passed everything is fine... But I will invest in new ones for this next baby
159067,2,"We have been looking for a multi-room monitor for a long time and when we saw this one I really thought it was going to be perfect. Unfortunately, one of the receivers was not working from the start. Then it was having major issues of staying in range. This seemed odd since I was just down the hallway trying to test it out. My advice....don't bother with this one!"
33694,1,"I love this gate. I bought it three years ago to block the opening on my front porch to keep the dog from running down the stairs. I live in SW Florida, and the gate has been in direct sunlight and salty weather since I got it and it still works great, no problems or falling apart... it's lasting longer than some of our decking. It's easy to open, even with on hand, but tricky enough to fool the baby. price is good compared to other gates."
39952,2,"I like the sounds this product makes. I just wish it went louder. We use these in our younger two children's rooms. We use it so we don't have to tip toe throughout the rest of the house when they are asleep. However, they are not loud enough to drown out our sounds. Our son is a heavy sleeper so it's fine for him, but our daughter is a light sleeper and this is not loud enough for her room."
44892,1,"I did not have to buy this pump, as I borrowed it from my sister-in-law. It is pretty expensive, but in my opinion it is an item worth the price if you work full time and want to keep breastfeeding going. I did not give it 5 stars because I think it could be much better if it wasn't such a hassle to set up. There should be a way to make the clean up and set up easier. Nevertheless, I believe the motor is powerful enough for constant use and it keeps the supply pretty well. I also like the convenience of Medela freezer bottles that you can purchase and use to pump directly into them."
174079,1,my baby is very fussy. I put him in the swing at 6 weeks and it has been a lifesaver. It works best if i put him in it before he starts to cry. My mother has the graco in her house and his head tilts to the side. This swing is very comfortable for him without all those tacky colors of the fisher price. It has been a lifesaver for us and it is easy to put together compared to the graco.
167752,0,"I got the stroller and initially loved it. I am glad I didn't review the stroller when I first received it.Initially, I noticed that the child's cup holder would not stay on. It was annoying to constantly have to pick up the piece and put it back. Well, it did eventually latch well, and when that happened, it snapped off while being transported in the trunk of my car.When I bought the stroller, I thought that the 5 point harness would be best for my little escape artist, but my child is skinny and the straps don't latch high enough to keep her from sliding her arms out and standing up in the stroller if I take my eyes off her for even a moment.On the upside: The stroller does look nice and is lightweight. It is able to make it through standard doors without issue and I had no problems maneuvering through a renaissance festival.I am editing this to say that I did email the company about my problem with the cup holder snapping off the side. They were very quick to respond to the issue and did provide me with replacement parts."
45936,2,"Rating based on daughter's scale: 5-star = ""Yea, Mommy!"", 1-star = ""Rather lick the breathable crib bumper""We got this as a replacement for an existing mobile that is too low. My daughter was very interested while I assembled this, but after I took my hands off of it, she gave me a look I didn't expect to see for another 13 years.After thinking about the brain development books and gender preferences, I dug all of the face-like images out. My daughter was again interested as I assembled everything. This time, she gave all the images a glance before rolling over and checking out the patternless crib bumper instead."
106744,1,I have to say that I really love this diaper pail. It is very easy to use. All you do is flip the handle and you are done. You don't have to buy refill bags for this diaper pail. I just use small trash bags that I already have. I also use cloth diapers and this pail works wonderfully for that. I have never noticed any odor that I've noticed with other pails. I recommend this product to all my friends who are expecting.
125985,2,"these diapers are more expensive than pampers with way less in the box and i haveno idea why that is, pampers are much better and these dont even have tabs on the sides where the velcro sticks so that the velcro tab doesnt rub against the babys skin and irritate it, i think that its insane to charge so much more for these diapers than pampers or luvs even because they are both far superior to these,i would not reccommend these to anyone."
99559,1,This is a nice box to purchase wouldn't have needed to buy diapers for 2 months but my son out grew this size before we ran out we had to order the next size up:)
50667,1,"Despite having a terrible name (both company name - Leachco?! and product name - Snoogle -?!), this item works as advertised. During the latter stages of my wife's pregnancy, she was not able to sleep comfortably. She tried using multiple pillows, but everytime she moved at night, she had to reshuffle all the pillows again. Thankfully, a fried of ours told her about the Snoogle, and we decided to try it out. Lo and behold, after the first night of using it, she was back to sleeping comfortably again. Well, I suppose as comfortable as possible when you are 8 months pregnant ;) Highly recommended for all pregnant ladies."
138016,1,"Pros:Nice night light3 color options (altho 1 doens't work)Has a timer so you don't have to worry about shutting off laterLooks cuteCons:The red light, does not reflect very well and you can't really see it at all on a ceiling or wallsThe constellation of ""stars"" are not really stars, they are triangles"
105989,1,"I bought this diaper pail for two reasons. The first reason is because this brand was used when I worked at a daycare. I figured if it can keep smelly diapers contained from 20 children, it can surely keep my son's room smelling good. The second reason I bought it is because I could use regular trash bags instead of having to buy the expensive Diaper Genie bags.My son is 4 months old now and this was one of the best purchases ever made. It's easy to use with only one hand and it keeps the nasty smell in the pail and out of the room. I buy cheap store-brand garbage bags and I am able to fill the diaper pail all the way and it still doesn't smell. I absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone."
161995,1,"We started bathing our daughter in this bath tub after her cord fell of at 18 days old. It was very nicely sized and fit right on our counter over our bathroom sink. This feature also allowed us to pull the plug after use and drain it right into the sink. The mesh covered ""baby holder"" that is placed into the bath for baby to lay on could be a little different. We found it hard to put enough water in to cover more than her backside, but still little enough to not be splashing over the side or onto her head. I thought it should be a little more contoured to her head. One turn of her head and water was getting right into her ears, and we only had it less than half full! Otherwise, she has grown well with it, now sitting up with the green part as a holder. I do reccomend this product!!!"
9742,1,"My older son would ONLY use this potty, which we had borrowed from a friend whose son was older. We moved and gave it back to them, as they had another younger boy and needed it. It is SO GOOD for boys especially, b/c the splash guard is HIGH and pee doesn't wiz everywhere. Also, it is SO SIMPLE to clean (just two parts) from an adult perspective. So, I bought this for my younger son (now 2.5 yrs and potty training) BUT, my younger son isn't really that into it. He sort of likes the other (cheaper and actually more annoying & more messy) potty. So, long story short, it's a good potty, especially for boys, but every kid is different and (as my older son says, &#34;Mom, kids like what they like...&#34;) each has their own opinion (especially 2 yr olds!), so you never know if this will be &#34;the one&#34; they want to use and get trained on! GOOD LUCK with potty training!"
105138,1,I BOUGHT 3 DIFFERENT ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE. THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN BAG ITS USER FRIENDLY AND IT KEEPS THE SMELL OUT.
119485,2,"Do NOT buy this monitor. It's noisy, it keeps you up at night more so than your baby! The light show is great but $50 is expensive for just a light show... spend your money on something else for baby and get a cheaper monitor!!!"
118392,1,"I purchased this bath seat for my second child (we had given away our previous infant bath tub). This is far superior to the other infant tubs I've used. It fits into our small plastic bath tub from IKEA. With other tubs I worried a lot about the baby slipping, and it was always stressful to hold the baby with one hand while washing her. Not so with this seat. She's 2 months old, and has always loved taking baths in this seat. And I can let her spend a little more time in the tub, since I am less worried about her slipping or hand fatigue on my part."
37131,1,"We got this gate for our front door which leads to a couple of steps. Now that our daughter is crawling/cruising and almost walking and with summer temperatures rising we wanted to be able to let her explore the house safely and be able to keep the door open.The gate is easy to install and fits very tightly in our door frame (so much so that we didn't have to screw in the cups to make it a permanent gate. The standard gate extension that is included with the gate will make it work for pretty much any door frame so you only need to order an additional extension if your door or opening is extra wide.The bars are close enough your baby can't go through but still leaves you with a view.We love the auto-close features, very handy when coming in/out with both your arms full.The downsides:1) you have to watch your step when using it so as to not trip over the floor bar2) you'll have to show everyone how to use it, the opening mechanism is easy to operate once you know how it works and kids will never figure it out, but it will take an adult some time too if you dont show them.I would recommend this gate, well worth the price."
52376,0,"This backpack was a great addition to our diaper bag choices, however it did rip inside one of the pockets with only a couple of uses."
45880,0,"I guess I missed the part on the product description where music in NOT mentioned. I just assumed a crib mobile would play music. Visually, it's exactly what I wanted but realizing that there is no music was a big let down. I will keep it though, and I will find music to attach to it or a separate toy to attach to the crib. It would be nice if the mobile did spin. I'll make it work."
104843,1,"This bookshelf was easy to put together, looks just like the image displayed, and seems pretty durable. My husband and I loved the painted (and raised) designs on the sides so much that we decided to set it up in our living room rather than inside her jungle/safari themed nursery! Currently we have about 15 smaller board books, 12 midsize books, and 9 large books inside the canvas shelves... and it is almost full. We also placed a couple of books horizontally below the bottom shelf. While the smaller books are a little challenging to see from the front, you can definitely see both the midsize and larger books well.My only piece of advice for anyone looking to purchase this shelf is to take a good look at the measurements! We of course wish it was a tad larger, but also like that it is a smaller shelf that will be easy for toddlers to access what they want to read. We ended up just storing some of our daughters more advanced books in one of those organizers that hangs behind her bedroom door."
3815,1,"Both of my boys have used this playmat and have loved it! I prefer it to the larger ones simply for that fact that it fulfills its purpose without taking up too much space. Both of my kids have loved the detachable parrot. I love that two of the toys can be moved to different locations. The head support doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose once baby can move around. It has kept both of my children entertained and held up extremely well. I have washed the playmat, and removable toys many times, and they still look brand new."
96952,1,"This item is everything that it is advertised to be. The sound is great, the product is very soft, and I would recommend it to anyone."
8322,2,"Warning -- this product has totally changed. We bought 2 sets from Amazon 2 years ago; the OLD ones are 5 stars. Now, the product is 1 star. After the first washing, they are too small to fit on the crib mattress. I stretched them as much as I could, and the wimpy elastic still could not hold the sheets on the mattress. Sheets that won't stay on the mattress are unusable -- thus the 1 star rating. Note, we washed and dried the sheets on medium heat, the same settings that the old product never shrank after 50+ washings. The new product is totally defective and we are returning it."
44847,1,"I bought this because it came highly recomended from other moms. It does the job since I was able to exclusively breastfeed for about 4 months after I returned to work, after the 4 months, my supply went down, but I don't think the pump had anything to do with that. I have heard that the Medela Pump In Style Advanced Backpack - Black is faster and easier to carry, so if you can swing it, get this one instead. I also haveMedela Harmony Manual Breastpumpfor home since I keep the pump in style at work"
36320,1,"The bags are so practical, pretty, fashionable, excellent for both mom and dad, all products inside are reachable, the diaper bag inside is a great addition. Love it!"
51831,1,"I absolutely love this stroller! It's pricey like most all jogging strollers, but so worth the money. Took my husband less than 5 minutes to put it together. You have to put air in the tires, only thing that takes a little extra time. We live on a bumpy drive...yet this stroller glides over everything so smoothly! I have the navy blue one, great for my son. It has a compartment on the bottom for the diaper bag, 2 cup holders for mom or dad, and cup and snack holders for baby. The seat reclines to fit baby's size and development. So glad I bought this stroller!"
55097,1,"You can't please everyone because there is no stroller that meets every need. So far, for our first four months with our twins, we've been happy. We like how it coordinates with our other Graco items and that our Snugride car seats snap right in with ease. The stroller itself maneuvers easily. It has gotten a bit banged up like in the plastic tray areas, but we've gotten used to any heaviness. It opens and shuts with one touch and so far has been stable and sturdy with our twins in their car seats."
84504,1,"This swing is very well made, has a tray across the front which is secure & can have a toy or a glass placed on it. It is the cutest toddler swing I have seen...bright red with a yellow tray. My great grandson swings in it every day. I would greatly recommend buying this swing."
37839,1,"It's been awhile since the last review so I thought I'd share my opinion. While some hospitals may (did) give you some of the items in the kit, it's not a guarantee that they will and there's nothing wrong with having a backup. I actually have 2 of these kits, one for the house and one for the diaper bag."
74599,1,"I am very pleased with this walker, we are not having any problems....their is a very tiny button under the driving wheel that must be turned off after use ...if left on for long periods of time, the battery will die as expected."
62825,2,"I liked the smell of the diaper gene or the odor the bags let off. Covers up odors really well.Basically it works like this:One long continuous bag that gets twisted around each diaper to lock in odor and make dumping a breeze, bag gets cut and drops into the container below, now your ready for the next diaper. Not that easy.First of all it's not easy to turn the knob for a smaller petite mother. Talk about a wrist workout. Then the cutter hardly worked causing the dirty diaper and most of the bag to come back out once you try and open it again. And if you get it to cut correctly you have to actually reach in and tie the bag again for the next diaper. I might be crazy but I never saw that on the box. Then when you do get the hang of it and more and more diapers go in, you have to empty it. And boy this little container doesn't hold that much. As much as newborns and larger babies poop you would think Playtex would have made it much larger and taller.Overall I was disappointed. I tossed more diapers in the trash then I did in the gene. It fills up really fast and doesn't work like it says. I had to retie the bag after each turn.More of a workout than a convenience.Would I buy it again. NoAm I glad I got it. Sort of. I didn't pay for it."
65523,1,"We didn't want to sell our Pontiac Vibe even though we were needing to fit three children in the back seat. We seemed to have made it with a Radian 65, Fisher Price Safe Voyage Booster and this Combi Connection. The base is both narrow and tall, so the other seats sit well with it."
154309,1,These are the only commercially available wipes that do not give my daughter a rash or cause redness. These are the only commercial wipes that I will use. I love them
183007,0,"This gets the job done, but one of the hinges on the lid already broke off. I've only been using it for 3 weeks. I don't really NEED the lid so it's ok, but it's a bummer that it broke so quickly."
94809,1,"These have proven to be the most useful item I've received since having my baby in September. I use them for wiping up spit up, during bath time, for cleaning up ""accidents"" mid-diaper change, for cleaning her face, and so many other things. They are incredibly soft, come in a nice size (15/pack), and wash/wear very well."
52854,0,"I have to say, just looking at the Baby Papasan makes you feel cozy and I couldn't wait to get one in my house. My son spent most of his time (even sleeping) in his bouncy seat and we thought that the Papasan would be more comfortable and secure for him for the long stretches he spent in it. He is not an off-the-charts baby in height or weight but at only 2 months (when I bought this) his legs were already hanging over the bottom edges by a couple of inches - it seems like the placement of the safety belt and the pitch of the seat are off. I didn't feel comfortable having him in it for more than a few weeks after I bought it (HE didn't even look comfortable)and Fisher Price says the weight limit is 25 lbs!! I would have taken it back had I not already thrown out the box."
49207,1,"I bought this play yard to corral my two young granddaughters. I can use it as a pen or I can secure it to other items to make barriers or a bigger ""yard."" I took it to the beach last weekend so the babies would be safe and easy to take care of. We put a sheet over 2/3 of it for shade. We had many many compliments on our ingenuity. We were asked where we purchased the Play Yard. We told them Amazon.com. But no matter where you purchase this item, you will find it well worth every penny. I purchased the two panel extension to give the two girls a little more room when they are together. My kids loved mine so much they bought their own for their homes. Great sturdy product."
6264,1,"I have twins and this has been one of the most helpful products we have gotten. The picture on the monitor is very clear and if one of the twins makes a noise not only can you hear it, but there are also lights on top of the monitor to indicate the noise level as well. This product is a little expensive, however it is well worth the money!! Trust me, I can be negative on a lot of products, but this is not one of them. You will not be disappointed if you buy this product."
46482,2,"I recently bought this and recieved it today in the mail. Their service was very fast, but the produst just wasn't what I had expected. It looks very faded and the fairy's aren't very cute at all. (The fairy's hands on the blanket look like a male body part.)I do not recomend this product, the pictures are wayyyyy cuter than it really is. (sorry)"
71269,1,I bought this as a Christmas Present for my 8 month old son. He loves it! It is very cute and easy to move from room to room. I wish I would of bought it sooner. I definately recommend it.
11705,1,"We bought this tub in 1997 when our first daughter was only six weeks old and used it on the bathroom counter (between the sinks) to lower her into shallow water and bathe her. When she was able to sit up on her own, we started using it in the regular tub. I can't say enough good things about this product. It's easy, convenient and environmentally conscious in that it uses a LOT less water than a regular bath. We actually bought a second, and used it for travel. Now we're expecting again and just ordered a new Snug Tub."
76148,2,"I was excited to get these so I could freeze breast milk and homemade baby food by one ounce cubes so I wouldn't have to waste or defrost milk I didn't need. But I swear, even though it reads that the cube sizes are 1 ounce each, I can only get 3/4 ounce in each...which is disappointing because now I will have to use 2 to cubes to get 1.5 ounces and so on and it's just inconvenient. Make sure they are on a flat surface when freezing because the lid does not make it so the liquid stays in their own cube, would be nice if it did. And it's kinda hard to get the frozen milk or food out once frozen. :/ not sure I would recommend this to anyone sadly."
177840,1,"We have two favorite swaddle blankets in our house. This one is my husband's favorite because it is so soft and holds a swaddle very well. When I first saw these, I thought ""what a gimmick. We know how to swaddle a baby and know that you can use many types of blankets to do so."" True, but this one is perfectly suited in size and material and it's very pretty - nice for those snuggly newborn photos. (I slightly prefer theJJ Cole Swaddle Blanket - Blue Stripebecause it feels more substantial and cozy and our baby clearly loves the satin binding and the feel of the blanket material. It is also very attractive and coordinates with the JJ Cole's wonderful burp cloths, which are the absolute best. I am glad we have both.)"
180276,2,"I bought the pump because I had read the reviews on this product and got the impression that it was one of the best manual pumps. That might be true, but my experience was dissapointing. The pump did not suction hard enough to produce milk. I tried several times through out the day and the pump did not suction out enough milk. Needless to say the pump is sitting in the closet."
106619,1,"The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning. I remember reading a good review about the Diaper Champ and deciding to get it.Honestly, it does a great job. It does contain the odor to inside the Champ. I have never noticed a smell in the room, even when it is full. I have to admit, however, that when you open that bad boy up to empty it, it's pretty funky, but what do you expect?If you wrap up your diapers good and empty it before it gets so full that you can't squeeze another diaper into it, you will really be happy. It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags. We use the scented bags, which we think helps a lot.Overall, we are very pleased with the Diaper Champ and would recommend it highly! (Only reason I rated it 4out of 5 stars is - nothing's perfect, I have a hard time giving out 5 to anything!)"
34521,1,"Unlike what some others have said, this diaper pail TOTALLY hides the odor. I have gone long periods of time w/o emptying it and one would never know because there is no smell. I love that it uses regular kitchen bags - if you use the cinch kind you can cinch it up before removing it and never have to smell anything. The compartment to put deodoriser in is a great bonus - but you really don't even need to use it. This is inexpensive and does the job really well."
134771,2,These knee pads are well made and padded but the straps are not stretchy enough or long enough so it will leave purple marks on your baby and cut off their blood supply! My son was 6 months old when I got these and he is not chubby at all just a normal breast fed baby with normal chubby legs and these will only work if your baby is SUPER skinny. If they change the straps on these it would be a good product.
95465,1,My sister had one of these when we were growing up so when I had kids I knew I had to have it because it would keep all my son's pointless stuffed animals up out of the way. Its just like the one my sister had but I guess I never realized how super stretchy this thing was. I installed it and it looked good but when I put the stuffed animals on it it stretched way down so I had to move it up which caused there to be more holes put in the wall. It still wasnt right and was hanging down on the dresser and I didnt want anymore holes on the wall so I just moved the dresser. Would of given it 5 stars if it wasnt so darn stretchy.
90650,2,"In the past year, I've come to appreciate and only purchase the Pampers brand for my growing daughter's needs. After reaching 15 months of age, however, the diaper wasn't able to keep hold up to overnight use and I started using a nighttime diaper from a different manufacturer. As grandmothers and others watch the baby, they don't know which diaper to use at which time, so I've completely switched from Pampers to another more sturdy brand that doesn't leak and doesn't cause wet mornings."
76585,0,"This kit is mostly bandages, there sure are a lot of them. The ointments and topical lotions are the exact same size and shape so they're very difficult to find, especially in a first-aid situation, and after the kit has been banging around the back of the car for a while. You actually have to look at each one and read if it's the burn ointment, bee sting stuff, or whatever. They should be color coordinated or at least written in big letters BURN OINTMENT or INSECT BITE on them. You can probably make your own kit with better ingredients for cheaper but for a simple kit to keep in your car for skinned knees and cut fingers it's ok."
40996,1,"i have a very active wiggly 12 month old girl, and i have never had a problem with leakage or anything. the only other diapers i like as much are huggies supremes but i find that the tabs rip off those... i highly suggest these for baby's comfort as well as leakproof-ness....."
20189,2,"Don't remember how we got these bottles, but I'm pretty sure we got them free with some promotion. Now I know why. They do not have good flow through the nipples, which makes feedings last forever. The bottoms are also designed poorly and leak everywhere."
129929,1,"We have 3 of them and have no complaints. I keep one in my car, one in my husbands, and have another for travel. It's super easy to snap the carrier onto it, and very easy to install in any car. I just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old, and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars. I could use the latch, or just use the seatbelt for older cars. I was worried that I would need my husband's help with the installation, but I was fine on my own just reading the directions. I recommend this for everyone!"
42436,0,"There aren't many newborn carriers out there, so we made sure to have a Moby for the first couple months. To be honest, we used it maybe 5 times. There is A LOT of fabric to tie and I could never seem to get it tight enough. It is comfortable fabric and does seem to distribute weight well, so I will give it that. Perhaps if we were more patient and practiced wrapping it a lot we would have used it more. However, what we did use was a Lillebaby Carrier which has an adjustment on the waist band to make the crotch size smaller (no clumsy inserts like Ergo). We use an Ergo now that our daughter is big enough but I'm not sure how we would have survived the first 3 months without Lillebaby. I'd recommend it over Moby any day."
19502,1,"My baby just loves this collection from birth. She smiles everytime she looks at the animals and has started cooing at them. The bright colors make the room lively. Overall, would buy from Lambs and Ivy again."
20205,1,"I have used Playtex bottles for all my children. Now on baby number three, I was excited to get the new and improved Playtex bottles. I love the wide because they are easier for my baby girl to grab hold of and learn to hold her own bottle.What I love about this new style is how very little to no air is sucked in. All my kids had problems with gas bubbles as babies and these bottle really helped stop this problem. This meant a better nights sleep for them and me.I also love that Playtex uses bottle liners. Easy cleaning, allows for breastfeeding moms to store milk and many other advantages you'll find as you use them.Highly recommend these bottle to everyone. Also a great gift for a new mommy to be."
101147,1,Pampers seem to be one of the few diapers my daughter doesn't have any leakage problems with AND that doesn't cause her diaper rashes. I stick with a brand I know works.
94065,1,this is our 2nd buy of this product. it's great for babies/toddlers wholike to throw their bottles or drop things while on their stroller or at the table.
49236,1,"Excellent! I needed some sort of barrier to set up outside to prevent our dogs from going from the front yard through a 7' passage to the side yard. Needed to be weatherproof and easily moved to the side when not needed. This is ideal. I only required 4 of the panels to span the opening, leaving me two to use elsewhere. This may not be the intention of this product but it suits this purpose perfectly. Very lightweight and easy to handle."
94975,2,"I bought this pump a few months ago after the birth of my third child who is exclusively breastfed. After research I purchased the product in the expectation that it was manufactured from an experienced brand, was expensive and would assist in my maintaining breastfeeding after my return to work when baby was only 8 weeks. I found the instructions limited i.e it did not even provide guidance on expressing milk and how to maximise milk production for women starting to express. I started to use the pump when baby was over five weeks. Very little milk was expressed after over one hour. THe pump was not adaptable and uncomfortable to use. Depsite pumping no milk came out. This continued even weeks after purchase that I had to hand pump in order to fill a bottle for baby. I felt so disappointed since the hard work in establishing breat feeding could be lost by the uselessness of this pump. I would have requested my money back from Medela since I feel that this product is a misrepresentation and I do not recommend it for working mothers because although I work I do require it for occasional pumping since in the morning and night I am able to nurse my baby. Rubbish and stressful."
106611,1,I love the diaper champ!!! It's easy to use and clean. And it's odorless!!
70738,0,"I registered for this bouncer for my second child because I wanted something we could long after he started sitting up; in that aspect is great. My older son (18 months older) sits in just fine, but he is still too short and his feet dangle. Both my boys love the toys in the toy bar. My little guy doesn't like the vibrations but that has nothing to do with the bouncer. We have tried other bouncer vibrations and he doesn't like them.Pros: Can be used longer than 5 months (sitting up)It's cheap, well compare to other bouncers that you could only use up to the point the baby is sitting up.Cons: It is a little bulky for traveling. You can't fold it.The blue bar on the bottom snaps out, no matter how hard I snapped back into place.The cow on the toy bar faces the wrong directionI would recommend it. It cheap and lightweight both my boys like the toys and you can use much longer than conventional bouncers. It's not perfect but what is?The blue bar snapping out on occasion is the reason I gave it four stars out of five. I am going to contact fisher price soon."
116939,1,My 3 months old baby absolutely loves to be in this tub. The way its made its made for her to be able to sit up comfortably while I can easily wash her. It has to be comfortable for her to be all smiles when it comes to bath time
136673,1,My daughter loved playing with this. It kept her entertained. It's very soothing.
55827,1,"Me encanto este producto, no solo por la rapidez con que calienta los teteros, sino la temperatura apropiada. Solo es tantear segun las instrucciones la cantidad de agua necesaria segun la cantidad de leche y el tama&ntilde;o de la botella. Lo recomiendo totalmente."
59831,1,"I have used this tub since my son's first bath. He is now 22 months old and weighs over 30 lbs and we are still using it. He makes this large tub look small these days. I know our days of using this are numbered.When he was an infant, I used this tub with one of those terrycloth tub liners that keeps warm. I never had problems with him sliding. Once he was able to sit up on his own I used the other side of the tub. But when it came time to wash his hair, I'd twirl him around and lay him back on the reclining side and wash his hair without getting any water on his face. Maybe your baby wouldn't care about water in his face, but mine always seemed quite bothered by it until just recently.Think about when you take a bath, don't you like to recline and relax? Well, my son likes to recline, too. I still have him lay back when I wash his hair and he always looks forward to it. He can't do it in the regular bathtub without slipping down.I highly recommend this bathtub! You won't be sorry. It's still in such great condition that I'll use it with my next baby, too!"
37875,0,"Most of the products in this kit work well. However, the nasal aspirator is horrible. The tip is very thick and difficult to get into the nostril. The bulb is very stiff and difficult to squeeze. This particular item in the kit is useless."
149716,0,Received the high chair and the box was missing all the hardware (screws and brackets) to assemble it. Called Kidkraft hotline and requested replacement parts. Replacement hardware came one week after call and high chair was very easy to assemble in 10 minutes. High chair is cute and seems well made.
152886,1,"I just bought this for my daughter who is 6 months old and she loves it! Her toes just reach the floor, but it doesn't seem to matter (plus, she's growing everyday). She loves the lights and sounds and could not be more thrilled to be able to sit and play all by herself. The toys fold away so she can play with blocks and things on the tray. My husband and I are so happy we got it for her."
79491,1,"I buy these for my daughter. I was introduced to them when i had my son, and i loved them. They don't leak and they are very soft. My daughter has extremely sensitive skin, and one brand of generic diapers actually gave her a rash. These are great- no problems with her sensitive skin and they come in the large economy pack which helps my budget."
74204,1,"The Joovy Caboose is light enough that my wife can push it with both of our kids (3 and 5-years old) onboard without breaking her back, and slim enough that it fits into our car trunk with room to spare.The front seat is comfortable and partially reclines, while the full harness allows you to go without the tray, if desired. The back seat slides to offer access to the smallish basket underneath, and is padded enough for comfortable sitting or kneeling, while the standing platform easily accomodates our son's size 12s with room to grow. The dual canopy is easy to remove and provides adequate shading from the sun on both sides, depending on the time of day.The only flaws, really, are the front tray, which is extremely difficult to remove, and the lack of a tray/cup holder up top for parents. Other than those relatively minor nits, this is an excellent stroller."
100898,1,"Among the Pampers Swaddlers, Costco Kirkland, and Huggies Snug and dry, this is so far the best and I am 100% satisfied and don't even want to try other brands. It is the softest one, even better than Pampers Swaddlers. It smells good but I think a little bit too strong. Use it for my baby day and night. Don't even to buy the night diapers. It is pretty dry even after the whole night."
81658,2,"I received this monitor as a gift and was very disappointed. For the price you would think its the best. The clarity is good you can hear everything that goes on in the room but When the batteries get a little weak and you walk by the monitor it is loud static that travels into the babies room and woke her up on several occassions. Even plugged in it made a loud static noise when the electric went off for 2 seconds which again woke my daughter up. I finally packed the thing away and bought the safety first safe glow 2 receiver monitor. So far so good. Do not buy that product, it doesnt give you peace of mind."
174766,1,"Does the job it is intended to do... What we like about this particular product is that it has ""4-sided walls"" where most other products only have 3."
176408,1,This breast pump is easy to use. I use it occasionally when I need relief when my son is full but my breasts are not empty or when I know that I need to leave milk for a sitter. I use it with the Playtex breast milk storage system. I love both products! I like the fact that you can adjust the suction to fit your comfort level. It is easy to clean as well.
22215,1,"I purchased this for my great nephew, as he travels to his Grammy's alot. It's perfect size for travel, although his Grammy leaves it up for each time he comes to visit, making it a convenient size to tuck in a corner out of the way. The bassinett part snaps to the top of the rails, making it very sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Great Quality product for a Very Reasonable price."
141425,1,Great toy with a volume control and multiple settings. The front toy section detaches from toy and can be played with while sitting.
28087,1,"These are by far the best wipes I have ever tried, and I think I've tried almost every brand and type. The scent is the very best part -- it doesn't smell like a diaper wipe, but has a very refreshing and clean smell. They are also very strong and work well to clean the worst dirty bottoms as well as stickiness from face and hands."
175144,0,"I ordered this for my 6 month old son, and first of all I want to say that he loves it! The only thing thas was wrong with it is that is must have gotten too hot during shipping and the toys inside were stuck on the plastic, and i had to peal them off. When I did that some of the paint came off and was still on the plastic, but all you have to do to get it off is rub on it a little bit, then it comes right off. But in all my son really does like it, and it seemes to be tough enough even for him! I would sugest this for people, but i would sugest that you get it before 6 months, i do not think he will have a lot of time to play on it...i wish i would have gotten sooner!"
38209,2,"Our 2 month old, 12 pound son hates to be confined. He hated this swing. The main problem was that he sunk into the seat - it looked so uncomfortable!!! He couldn't move his arms or legs and he cried when we put him in it. But if you have a baby that likes to be swaddled and kept confined - this may be the swing for you."
138259,1,"Possibly my kids' most favorite gift we've ever gotten them thus far (and our kids have quite the variety of toys). We bought this for our boys for Christmas and they LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!! My youngest (who is 2 yrs old) won't go to sleep or even take a nap without his turtle on. I was sure they'd like it when we ordered it for them, but I had no idea what a hit it'd be. Yeah, the gold light is hard to see but it's no big issue...and not a deal breaker by any means. Great for kids of all ages - heck, even fun for adults. I wish I'd had one when I was a kid!"
123065,2,"I bought this potty because I thought it was SOOOO cute, looking like a real toilet with the toilet paper roll and everything! I still think it's cute, but just like many other reviewers say, all the music and talking and sounds are WAY too distracting to be able to actually learn potty training. And, like other reviewers say, the sensor is NOT accurate, so it's always saying the child went potty when they didn't. Very confusing for a child who's trying to learn to really ""go"" in the potty.We're currently potty training our daughter, and we have three training potties -- this one, an older one that has a soft seat, and one that fits into the ring of the big toilet -- and this potty is the last one my daughter will pick when it's ""potty time."" When we first got it she had a blast with it, using it as a toy and nothing more. Now that the newness has worn off, she shows very little interest in it.If I had it to do over, I would have given her this potty without the batteries in it and without her even knowing it had the capability to make all the sounds.Here's a suggestion: Don't put in the batteries until your child has mastered potty training. Then, as a reward for his/her accomplishment, put batteries in and show your child what the potty can do. With the training part out of the way, the sounds won't be such a distraction anymore."
109355,1,"We discovered that we can drop a single ice cube from our ice maker in one of these and it's perfect for teething! Sure, it gets him a little wet as he sucks on the ice cube but it's just water. I have tried these with bananas and, to me, it was more mess than it was worth."
127319,2,"This crib was great at first. Then at three month my baby started to roll. I tried putting the bumpers in, but they would not fit, so we were going to try to fix it. I put my son in the crib while I went to the bathroom and when I came back out his leg was stuck in between the wooden slates up to his thigh. I could not pull his leg out, so we tried pulling the slates apart trying to bend the wood to shimmy his leg out, but it did not work and he was screaming in pain and panic. To finally get him out we had to pull one of the wooden slates until it actually broke off in order for us to get his leg out. Fortunatly for us he was not actually harmed any any way. We have not put him back in this crib. The slates should not be wide enough for a little baby's limbs to get stuck and then the end slates be so wide that the bumbers do not fit. This is an unsafe crib."
19816,0,"Maybe it's just my wily 14-month-old grandson, but nimble toddler fingers can muscle the bowl off the highchair tray. I think the bowl is great, but he thinks it's a challenge. I'll continue to use it and hope he gets bored with the game, as it is a great way for him to feed himself."
107753,1,"If you don't put this thing together right, it won't work. Read the instructions very carefully. Once you figure out how all the pieces fit together, it's super easy and quick to assemble. It's manual, so you have to have patience for it to create some pressure. This thing saved my life. At first I wasn't getting pressure, and I was just using it to get my nipple to poke out so that my baby could latch on easily. Then, pressure started to build, and milk was flowing out like a fountain. Once I got the hang of it, it was great. It doesn't hurt, it's small and easy to carry around. The only thing I hated were the 4 oz bottles it came with. They leaked and came with too many pieces (bottle, neck and top). But I don't see those in the picture here, so maybe Avent did away with that. I discovered that regular avent bottles can attach to the pump as well, so that was good."
2298,0,"I ordered these after my daughter came home from daycare wearing a pampers diaper, and I loved it. Unfortunaltey, this was not the diaper she came home in. These are plastic and are not worth the money. With the exception of the cute prints, they are exactly like luvs, but a lot more expensive. I like LUVS, but thats not what I wanted/paid for. Also, the diaper I loved so much was actually a pampers cruiser. Which I did end up ordering the next time around. they are like swaddlers...soft, more cloth like."
139746,1,"Other reviews comment on the screws being stripped easily and ours would have been too except I noticed the allen wrench they provided was too small and thus slipping and we had a set with one that fit much better and made it easy to manage the screws. I'd say don't worry about the pads, they just get dirty anyway and we don't use them. The quality of the platforms isn't the best but is good enough. We love the chair."
33856,1,i bought this for a gift for someone who was surprised by the sex of their baby. room looks amazing for boy or girl.
70671,0,"pros: metal rocker legs rock very well which i great for us parents who type amazon reviews w/ one hand while rocking a baby in said chair w/ other hand, or even w/ a foot!cons: i can see the rocker being too effective once baby is bigger and pitching himself forward as some parents have mentioned. Also, toy bar is clumsy to remove when taking baby in and out of chair or getting out of way when baby prefers to watch the world instead of toys. also, not very portable when taking to grandma's house.verdict: get the other fisher price newborn to toddler rocker chair."
139965,1,I have two dachshunds that I want to keep out of the formal dining room and formal living room but I have a wide area to block off so most gates wouldn't work. This one does and it's easy to step over or move to get to these rooms or the front door. I like that I can just fold it up and put it in my closet if I have guests and don't want it there. I had purchased a metal gate previously that had a door opening through it but people always managed to knock it down and it was a pain to put back together so I gave up on it. It also damaged my wall. This one looks great and I would highly recommend it to people with small dogs. I only wish I had purchased it sooner.
45656,1,"Despite a *very few* negative reviews, I went with my gut and ordered this as there are SO MANY awesome reviews. I am so happy I did! My baby is only 5 weeks old but he seemed to be bored and need more stimulation. I thought he was too young but I ordered this play mat and he LOVES it! Not all babies are the same and some may not take to it right away, but they eventually will for sure. I really like how the toys can hang low. And you can change their position and add your own toys if you want. The mirror pivots so you can change the direction it points. Also, there are little play items that make different noises/fabrics to enhance the babies sensory awareness. LOVE IT! You will not be disappointed in it. Choose this one. Trust me!"
40675,1,"Snugger fitting than Target brand, Seventh Generation, and Huggies. Not one accident. Thick and absorbant. No chafing. Great elastic waistband and tabs stick firmly. Faint, but pleasant, scent. No complaints at all from our little girl. Yes, it costs a bit more, but absolutely well worth it."
175783,2,So disappointing. I should have listened to the previous review that it is not good quality because it isn't. It is actually about to come down. It un-peels from the wall continuously.
149031,1,I waited till I was 30 weeks pregnant to buy this pillow. I really thought I could just use the pillows I had at home to use for sleeping on my sides and for my backache. OH but I am SOOOOO VERY glad i bought this pillow. The first time I used it I fell asleep within 10 minutes. It was great;)I sleep through the night now without any backaches and I only get up is to use the bathroom.
120072,0,"I have no time to clean these tiny little parts! Then it's easy to lose the microscopic bottle brush. It's also annoying b/c it tells you not to shake, but stir the formula. Well, when you have a screaming baby the last thing you want to do is stir a bottle. I was using them here and there if baby was still hungry after breastfeeding. I guess the only good thing about them is they forced me to continue breastfeeding b/c I didn't want to deal with cleaning and assembly all the time. They do work to prevent gas though."
128788,1,"brand new as stated, great nipples baby girlloves them. . . . . . . . . . . ."
20530,1,grandchild loves the lights and music. only 5 months old and just a peanut but can still bounce and play well in it. with own stand you can take or put it anywhere. great price.
91733,2,"We have a peg perego and this rain cover fits it fine. Although I would agree with the other reviewer that it would be much better if it were longer and came down more in the front. But my biggest complaint is that our cover cracked. Apparently, when it's really cold the plastic gets really hard -- when we had a number of below zero days this past week the cover cracked and now is totally useless to us."
77173,1,"This swing was awesome for the short amount of time my daughter fit in it. Unfortunately I waited a bit too long to make this purchase and by the time I received it she only was able to use it for about a month before she grew out of it. It is also very bulky, which was a bit cumbersome in my apartment, but well worth it to give my arms a break from holding her. There were a couple of weeks there where she would only sleep in the swing! The mobile was great, the ability to go side to side or front to back was a huge plus. If you're planning on getting it, just be aware that it will only last those first couple of months."
169403,0,"I got this armoire for significantly less on ebay, it was easy to put together (I did it by myself in an hour or so at 6 months pregnant) and none of the pieces were damaged. However I'm not sure what Storkcraft considers ""hard wood"", the armoire scratched very easily (you could scratch the wood with your fingernail) when I put it together. Otherwise it is a very nice piece of furniture, I would not have thought it worth the $300-$400 price range some websites have it listed at because the wood is so soft (it seems to be pine). I did end up taking out one of the shelves and installing a clothes rod, and adding a few hooks inside the doors for extra storage."
114556,0,"This was great but now that my daughters inside arms are pinched it's going to be someone else's. I loved it at first but the last four times (no matter how careful we are) catches her skin. She's quick, as are most young kids so just be very careful. Other than the pain it causes it's great and I really liked it. I'm sad to be getting rid of it but the pain and tears is too much I want her to like eating not be terrified of her seat."
30555,0,"My baby liked this alot at first but, as others noted, he quickly was too big for this product. We ended up removing the sling very early and just using the tub. It worked great for when he could sit with just a little assistance. As he got bigger he sat in the deeper end just fine, but we soon just started bathing him in the tub by the time he was 7 months because the tub is easy to squirm out of for very mobile kids!"
8864,1,"I love these. I haven't had to take them off the table so I can't speak to the residue part, but these are snug and protective."
107990,1,"I own 3 pumps - this is the best manual pump. Great when you have to travel and do not have descrete electric outlets handy.Does not have the suction power of my ac pump, but gets the job done.Only downfall are some of the parts are too small to put in dishwasher - easy to loose."
127785,2,"I've just bought 2.4GHz ultra-range monitor and for my surprise after I installed following de instructions it just wouldn't work without very loud interference. I've tried to use in a different house, several blocks away, and the problem remained.I've tried to turned off all the electronic equipment (even the TV) at my house and the interference wouldn't go away. It's a shamed that an expensive baby monitor like this would have basic problem just like a cheap and low quality model."
20146,1,"The vent in the bottom of the bottle makes it very easy for baby to extract milk. The flow is fast and furious which is good if your baby has trouble feeding from non-vented bottles. However, the high flow can overflow the capacity of my baby's mouth (&lt; 2mo old) which leads to messiness.Other drawbacks are that occasionally the vent holes leak. There are also many different parts that need to be disassembled for cleaning.I have both the ""wide"" and ""standard"" versions and there isn't any difference when it comes to feeding. The nipples are basically the same and my baby has no preference. I prefer the wide version because it is shorter (&lt;7"") which makes it easier to fit into wall cabinets.As far as reducing gas, I haven't noticed any difference between these bottles andThe First Years Breastflow Bottlewhich I also use. I typically prefer The First Years bottle because of the slower flow. However, this may not be a problem once my baby gets bigger.Overall, this is a fine baby bottle despite the minor drawbacks."
14040,0,I was happy to read that other mothers have had problems with this bottle leaking and it wasn't just me doing something incorrectly. I recieved 2 Avent bottles as a free promotion and decided to try them. When they don't leak - I like the bottle very much. Sometimes I can get through a feed without a leak and sometimes I can't. I've kept the bottles as spares.
92097,1,"My pregnant wife uses a standard pillow as her ""wedge"". We have a queen size bed and between her extra 'size' and the extra pillow between us there wasn't much room on the bed left for me. I got her this small pillow that takes up almost no extra room, and I slept well thereafter! Enough said."
154529,2,"These wipes smell terrible and gave my baby a terrible rash. It took awhile before I realized these were the cause and now I know for sure. DO NOT use them on their face or arms or anything except to wipe their bottom, or your baby could be covered in a rash, that is if your baby has sensitive skin. I am now going to try tushies wipes and hope for better luck. Unfortunately I bought a case of them and hopefully will find someone that can use them."
42547,1,"I was worried about getting this carrier- I have a large chest and am plus sized. I was worried that it would be uncomfortable or not fit. I love my Moby!I bought my Moby in Navy Blue and it was great for carrying my young son.Positives:- my son had colic and this was excellent for him- felt secure when tied CORRECTLY- more attractive than other carriers in my opinion- many sites (even youtube) that teach you how to tie it correctly- put it on at home under my coat, and then just slipped child into it- no messing around putting it onNegatives:-whew it got hot in that Moby, it is not for the summer (or pick one of their more breathable models- I stopped using it around 6 months. I know others use it longer, but my baby was far too wiggly and bouncy (it was like having a washing machine attached to your chest haha!)I highly recommend a Moby- but I also highly recommend learning how to use ANY baby carrier correctly. Your baby should be in a hug hold, not a horizontal hold. You should be able to kiss the top of your baby's head when they are in the carrier. You should never cover the child's face in the carrier. Remember to wear your baby safely!"
83505,1,Ive had this for 2 years now..and my 3 year old uses it to get lift to jump in bed.its very sturdy (his 46 pounds are not shaking it) the only complain i have is with the mesh its ripped in some places coz my kid likes to stick fingers in them. I dont like that i have to leave it all the time..coz i dont want to go to the trouble of taking it of. but it looks cute with the decor..and is really really sturdy!!!
70587,2,"I bought this for my daughter who is 1 month old. The moment I put her on it, I knew, she would not be comfortable.I think, this rocker is designed for kids 1 year and above but certainly not for infants."
35468,1,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift, and we love it. I just put her in the shopping cart seat for the 1st time last week, and sure enough her mouth went right for the handle. Luckily I had the Floppy Seat cover on it. She is 7 months old and loves the bright colors and the toys we hook onto the loops. It also fits over a wide variety of public highchairs as well."
81059,1,My daughter is 2 1/2 yrs old and potty training has not been easy for me. My daughter gets nervous when she isn't around &#34;her&#34; potty so having this seat has been very helpful! My daughter knows of it as &#34;her potty seat&#34; She uses it when we are out in public at grocery stores and at other peoples houses that dont have children! It has helped me in the training process so much! I read all the reviews before I bought it and some said it collapses easy but as long as you push it towards the back so there weight is supported it will not collapse. It is a great product and greatly priced! I would highly recommend!!
107276,1,"I love the convenience of not having to buy special bags. I got my Diaper Champ as a hand-me-down from a relative, and it still works great. There is no diaper odor in our nursery. When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!).If you don't clean things, they don't smell clean. This isn't rocket science.The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I don't like the opening mechanism on the front. But I can't think of any way they could've done it differently that would be as effective."
91645,1,"we just recently purchased this for our 6 week old son, and he ABSOLUTELY loves it, he just stares and stares and if i set him on his boppy underneath it, he can kick at the toys. it is GREAT"
151849,1,We received an old bassinet from a friend for our new baby. The pad is smaller than some of the new ones so this sheet worked perfectly for us.
39026,1,"We have at least 6 of this kind of wrap and find they work well for our sons. You have to be careful to make sure the diaper is all inside the wrap, but otherwise we have had no leakage problems with these.If they pee a lot at one time, the edges will get wet and you will have to wash it(I have found most are this way). The snaps are great for after children have discovered how to open the snap and velcro type. These are also easier to wash; no velcro sticking together in the wash. These tend to run a bit small. If you need advice on cloth diapering, an Oregon company called Babyworks is very helpful; their catalog has lots of info."
30576,2,"Loved this at first using the sling with my newborn. Up until he weighed too much for the sling(10 1/2 lbs). The ""bump"" in the bottom of the tub proved to be a huge problem. It is supposed to support them after they outgrow the sling but it sits them too high up and his head would bob back & forth. We soon retired the tub soon after we bought it. Very unsatisfied with this purchase. He now happily takes his bath on a big towel in regular tub with couple inches of water. Splashes and kicks to his delight. Wish I could have saved the money buying this fisher price tub."
10040,1,We bought this in conjunction with the step stool for our son (now 4yrs) when he was potty training. He is a big boy and is potty trained but STILL uses this seat on the toilet to keep from falling in. He also still uses the stool! Worth every penny!
132917,2,"I registered for this item back and receiveed it when my son was born in January, 2006. About 2 1/2 months later, the spring on one side of the insert broke and when I tossed in a diaper, the trap door didn't spring back closed. I contacted the company, and after about 2 weeks of emails and phone calls, I received an email back advising me that they had a problem with a batch of them and would send me out another insert. Well...after another 3 months or so, I once again find myself with the same problem. I don't even use it that frequently (maybe 3x a day) because my son is in daycare full time. I have once again contacted the company but I am very annoyed that I have had the same problem twice within 6 months. At this point, I will hopefully receive another insert but I would not be too quick to rush out and purchase this product again."
85434,1,My husband purchased this for me when I was 4 months pregnant and just beginning to have trouble sleeping because the bed pillows weren't working anymore. The first night I slept the whole night through I didn't have to worry about the pillows falling off the bed. It is alittle big so if you have a Queen size or larger bed you should be ok.
23271,1,"I just got it, and put my previously frozen in lansinoh bags breastmilk in it. The bags were a little too wide, but lots still fit in it, and now they're organized! This was the only system I could find and the quality seems decent."
44746,1,"This carseat is AMAZING! We have had this carseat for over a year and a half and it is sooooo great, our 5yr old loves it and she will be in it until she is 6yrs old, which we love.Yes the carseat is heavy but thats part of what I love about it. Also the price is really fantastic, Britax seats I think are ridiculously expensive, yes they are safe but not everyone can afford it so this seat is a perfect option."
41856,1,"Nice quality mattress--very thick; good enough to use as baby's ""real"" crib; not just for grandma's house."
40073,1,"When my now 5-year-old daughter was an infant, I was having a particularly difficult night when I decided on something of a whim to try plugging my own white noise machine in her room and turning it on for her. Lo and behold, she quieted down and went right to sleep.Ever since that night, I have sworn by sound machines for infants and I frequently buy them for friends and family as baby gifts. I've purchased several models and have that aforementioned model that my daughter still uses. It can be difficult to find a machine that makes a good variety of sounds but that doesn't cost a fortune or have extra, unnecessary bells and whistles (such as being attached to a radio). Because of this, I was very pleased to find this model.I've noticed that some other reviewers think the machine is too quiet but I don't find this to be a problem. It isn't possibly to blast the sounds but then I prefer to just use them as background noise anyway. If you're looking for something that will totally mask other sounds in your house (the TV, the vacuum cleaner), then this probably isn't the model for you. If, however, you just want something to provide some nice white noise for your little one, I would recommend this unit.One of the features that I particularly like is that this machine gives you the option to combine two sounds to give it a slightly different effect. I found that the rain and thunder combination is particularly nice. The thunder is a fairly gentle rumble, not a loud crash, so as contradictory as it may sound, it is soothing.Overall, this is a nice, simple product that suits its purpose well."
68886,1,"I love this diapers, baby is very comfortable in it. And I love amazon free super saving shipping (they promise to delivet in 5-10 days, but it takes only 2-3 days!!!), the last package I got next day after ordering!!! Thanks amazon.com for great service!"
49679,2,"The gate was easy to install and looks fine, if a little chitzy. BUT, the latch is near impossible to do one handed, and really hard to do with two. You certainly can't do it with the light off. Sort of a drag when you have to go through it in the middle of the night. THe top and bottom each only clicks into the eye part of hook and eye set. I don't think it's that sturdy. I wouldn't recommend this gate if you have to go through it often. Lots of them are much easier."
98628,1,Had this car seat for almost a year now for our 2 year old. The great thing about it is that she will be able to use this for years and years to come. Seems very comfortable in it. We will be purchasing another for our son
146227,1,"I bought this for my daughter, 3-4 months old, and off the bat she loves it. Now 4 months, and with a pillow under her, she jumps and smiles for at least 15 min at a time. She is also grabbing at everything and spinning the lizard wheel!"
117126,1,"I bought this bag for my husband to use when he takes my daughter out without me- cause my bag is rather girly. He's a tall guy, and this bag fits him very well. It has enough room for all of my daughter's items. My husband really likes this bag."
145508,0,"This is a great product which worked well for my baby (now 9 months old) until he was about 7 months old. By 7 months old he was too tall to sit in the jumperoo without his feet being planted on the floor while bending his knees. I used other similar products which worked well for my child at 7 months. My boy is tall for his age, but the other products would have lasted longer."
3442,1,"I recommend this item if you wash your pump parts in a dishwasher or a sink with a disposal. These are the smallest pieces of the Medela Harmony manual breast pump, and can be easily lost. I received two valves and two membranes in the manufacturer-original packaging as pictured."
28439,0,"This chair is certainly comfortable and price wise it's great! The only thing that bothers me is that when you glide and you are leaning with your back on it too, it makes a clicking sound with every glide. From experience most gliders do that , I was hoping this one didn't. Otherwise it's a good glider."
153677,1,Nicw quality. The brown is a light brown though. It looked darker in the picture.
15028,1,"I nursed and bottle fed my son at the same time for about 2 months and he had no nipple confusion with the Avent nipples. He would not take Playtex or Gerber nipples after getting used to Avent, though. I guess it all depends on your baby. We used Avent 9oz and 4oz bottles exclusively throughout his first year and they all worked great. As others have said, just don't overtighten the top to avoid leakage. These bottles fit in our First Years bottle warmer with no problems. The only caveat is they are a little pricey."
96239,1,I love this bag it has lots of differnt compartment to store your stuff and its own changing pad. It has lots of room inside. It also doesnt get dirty. I love this bag!!
160251,1,I bought this on a whim and did not realise its advantages at the time - but it is great! The diaper compartment velcroes open so you can keep the top of the baby swaddled and warm while you change him - Jack loves that. The 'Teddy Tabs' - bear-shaped velcro tabs - are adorable - we get so many complements on it. Jack wiggles out of normal blankets. Swaddling is recommended by SIDS organisations and to calm babies. I often use this as a first layer and a couple of blankets wrapped around him when I'm carrying him in inclement weather (as the blankets inevitably loosen). Definitely recommended.
75856,1,I used the original Avent with my son 5 years ago. I now use them the tempo and love them. The best is my husband finds them so easy.
18344,1,"We registered for this and received it as a shower gift. My daughter loved the musical star from the moment I laid her on the mat. Unfortunately, the motion sensor did not work. I called the manufacturer, and they sent me a new one. The customer service rep was very helpful. The new star works great, and now that my daughter is almost 6 months old, she still loves it. She does roll into the gym bars now that she is more mobile, but she still loves swatting at the toys. She has discovered how to pull hard enough so extra links will come off into her hands, and seems to smile as if she's proud of herself. I can't compare this to other gyms, but so far this has served its purpose. Once they start rolling all over, the size of the mat will not be significant."
26285,0,"The bag is great. It fit our seat with no problem. However, on our return trip, the main strap attachment broke. They are made of thin plastic and apparently cannot take a lot of handling. It may have been the 3 time I lifted the seat. Although, there is no telling what happened in the baggage area. With that said, it was still frustrating pulling the seat through the airport by the strap instead of pulling it over my shoulder."
75299,1,"I checked many pumps online and thought this would be a good compromise. Didn't want the stress of manual, but couldn't afford Medala. Having used Medala at the hospital _ my daughter ended up in NICU for a week - I have to say, I didn't give up any quality. The pump is small and light to take around, has good suction and tons of settings so you can get a rhythm that's right for you. You also don't have to clean the tubes as they don't touch the milk - and you can use batteries if you like - though I never tried this way. My daughter is now 9 months old and I'd recommend this pump to anyone. Lansinoh bags are pretty good too - except I found a couple of the newer lavender ones had holes. Now i check them before i fill them by blowing a little air inside and making sure all sides are sealed."
23057,2,"I liked the product, but as the supplier sent just one (I ordered 2) I face a problem. It doesn't cover the whole wall. I checked the internet site of toysRUS but they do not sell it on internet. So it is an unpleasent situation."
4735,1,"These are great diapers. No harmful chlorine. And, they work great. No leaks, even overnight when super full. Fit well too. They do run a little small but I experienced that with other brands too."
86767,0,seriously its good in theory and looks durable but the second I took it out of the packaging I already had problems with the latch of the hook. It doesn't connect very smoothly so I sometimes have to struggle with putting bags on it. I will still continue to use it I guess but it's not the life saver I thought it was going to be
101220,1,"The product is great, and Amazon service is exceptional. Love doing on line shoping. Deliver on time, just before we ran out of last batch."
51004,1,Bought it for expecting Mom and she seems to be satisfied with it. She uses it for sleeping and resting as she gets bigger.
5916,0,"So these covers work great -- my intrepid toddler can't get them to budge, and has ignored all of the outlets since she discovered that it's futile to try. That being said, we can't plug in anything to the outlets that are covered with these plates, because the plugs won't stay in place (the little cover that makes sure baby is safe also makes sure that the plugs move a wee bit out of the socket, so nothing works). That being said, it definitely does its job of making outlets babysafe. They're also parent-and-grandparent-safe too!"
39356,1,"So happy I use these for my baby, secure, easy, practical, simple, I love these, I'll be getting more soon : )you can't go wrong with these. get them."
44727,1,"We were just involved in a car accident this afternoon where someone ran a stop sign and we hit them. We had the Raidian65 car seat for my 14 month old son and I am online buying another Radian65 car seat. Although all the adults are extremely sore, my 14 month old son seems perfectly fine. We had him rear-facing and he was frightened but not injured and doesn't even seem sore.We had an Eddie Bauer car seat originally and did not like the way the seat fit in our Trailblazer. I did some research and saw that the Radian 65 was one of the top-rated car seats according to Consumer Reports, as well as more narrow than the Britax car seats. We tried it out and were very happy with the seat.Unfortunately I have the experience to say that this seat will definitely help keep your child protected if there is ever the need. Plus, it is narrow so you have room for passengers and more car seats if necessary. I would definitely recommend this seat to anyone!"
147475,1,"This seat is a bit more expensive than most other bouncer seats but it's well worth it. The beauty of its seat is definitely its simplicity. I was looking for an alternative to all of the super bright colors, vibrating, dancing, slicing and dicing bouncers.The pros:- Firm, stable base and hardware unlike lots of bouncers with plastic pieces that seem a little flimsy.- This seat reacts to even small movements of the baby so even the youngest can bounce!- Due to the base, the bounce is even and not shaky or erratic at all.- The seat can be used much longer than most bouncer seats.- The seat can be adjusted to three different heights.The cons:- It is a little more expensive than Fisher Price and other bouncers, but again it's worth it!- Adjusting the seat requires you to take the baby out because of the way the base snaps. There have been times when the baby's fallen asleep in it and I wanted to recline without possibility waking him."
96709,1,"We love the sleep sheep, it is super soft. My daughter was not falling asleep without being held I got this for her for christmas and she started sleeping much better. We like the rain and the waves, the whales sound a little erie but I have always thought that of whale songs. And the heartbeat sounds just like when we rented an ultrasound machine to listen to her heartbeat in utero."
58396,1,"I had used another brand of diapers and ended up changing sheets every morning because of the serious leaking. It was awful, so I switched to these and love them. Definitely no leaking whatsoever, so I will be using pampers from now on."
51545,1,"LOVE this product. my son had never slept better--until he grew out of it. things have never been the same since. the cotton flannel is definately better than the cotton knit because it doesn't stretch. the knit is too stretchy and he was able to wiggle out of it. the cotton flannel didn't come in a bigger size when he was using it, maybe they'll have one now. he actually grew out of it in length before width. he ended up ripping the hole on the bottom even bigger and by morning he would have a foot sticking out from the bottom, which, of course i thought was cute. never tried the fleece, he was a very hot baby. i contacted kiddopatamus about that problem and they were very helpful, great customer service."
75968,1,"Pretty good, fully satisfied, the product was what I expected, I received exactly what I expected, i highly recommend, like I Said Just Great!"
33791,1,"THE ITEM WAS EVERY THING THE PICTURE SHOWED IT TO BEVERY HAPPY WITH THE BADGER BASKET ELITE OVAL BABY BASSINET,CHERRY WITH WHITE EYELET."
118935,0,I received this item. The side of it is scratched. I do not have time to return it and get a new one before my grandson comes to visit. It appears to be a sturdy product but am disappointed that the veneer is scratched.
64346,1,"Went on my first hike with this backpack over the weekend. My daughter loves this and she is 14 months old. The problem was not with her. The problem was with the shoulder straps. I am a muscular guy and the shoulder straps went over my neck muscles and within 45 minutes my neck was in some fairly bad pain.The hip straps were also not far enough down, so they rest more around the very lower portion of my rib cage than my hips, which also did not help the should strap location.I really like this bag and I think if you are more lean than I am then it will work out well. I have very broad shoulders and I keep in shape so it did not work for me. Again, my daughter loved this and if it had fit me well, this would be a 5 out of 5."
86721,1,"I bought something almost identical from Home Depot for $2.99. Just sold as simple versatile hook. The wording on the foam part just says something generic, not ""The Mommy Hook"". It works great for hanging things off the stroller handle bar!Mommies beware though, I've learned that many things can simply be rebranded / marketed as ""baby-fied"" items, and all of a sudden you're paying twice as much.That said, this is an awesome product when used as a stroller hanger."
146694,1,Ot's really good bub realy like it so handy but not suitable for reflux baby. My baby loved it but he vomit everytime he in it. Even when few hours after feed. Not using it for a while. Such a waste as he will grow out of it :(
140183,1,"My twin boys were born at 38 wks. and were large for their age, so we used this stroller since they were 2 mo. and on. We have had NO problems with this stroller, and for the money, it's great. My boys are now 2+ years old and we still love this stroller. Granted- we only use it for outside walks, and we don't have to walk through doorways (with any double stroller that is difficult!)- but we love the storage underneath, the double cup holder/storage place for mom, and the price! If you are looking for a stroller for the daily stroll, this works great. I bought it because I didn't want to have to use my ""indoor"" stroller (Maclaren Twin Traveler) for outside activities. So far, I love the amount of stroller I have received for the price."
39208,1,"Please ignore the reviews about this being ugly and drab. I went and bought it at BRU and it is sooo cute. It's soft and plush and is perfect if you looking for something feminine, but not girly. A great buy!!"
146832,1,My son loves these decals in his bedroom.. When they came in the mail he wanted to put the up right away and he has loved his spiderman room ever since
41391,1,We've tried a lot of diapers over the 16 month life of our son and Pampers (starting with the swaddlers) have always been the best at stopping leaks. We really like the Cruisers as well. It has always been a good fit and worth the slightly higher cost. Ordering them from Amazon was simple and the box arrived quickly.
112371,2,"Initially I was excited to find the ""jumbo"" box of pampers available online - I live in Manhattan and can't easily make it to a Costco/Sam's/BJs/Price Club. However, the price on this item isn't as good of a deal as when they first started offering it. In fact, I get a bettter price ""per diaper"" using our local online grocer. Do the math before you buy!"
83885,1,"After seeing many friends with this mat, we finally bought one. We use it at our kitchen table instead of using it for travel. Our son loves it, too. It's easy to clean and doesn't stain! We are giving it as a gift to all of our friends who have new babies. We will be buying another one ourselves when our daughter is old enough to feed herself."
57490,1,"This was a gift for my sister's new baby. He loves it! She loves it! It's a little more expensive than similar models, but the gentle vibration and music are wonderful. Worth the extra $$."
111479,0,"We have a 27 pound male pug who is determined to mark the baseboards in our living room. Then our large male dog, who isn't normally a marker, is tempted to leave his two cents, and it starts to get ridiculous...I have tried various kinds of washable wraps and washable diapers, but the pug is always able to get them off by walking back and forth under a table or chair. Nothing stayed on him for more than 5 minutes, and certainly not overnight.I was hoping to find a product that would allow him to be with our family instead of spending the night in a crate and/or being penned in the kitchen while we're gone. I originally bought this product in the medium size, based on the sizing chart on the package. The medium wouldn't even go around his waist, but the diaper seemed OK otherwise, so I ordered large.My observations about the large diapers: they do fit around his waist, which is approximately 22 inches. (Didn't get a whole lot of cooperation while measuring.)The repositionable tabs make it easier to get the things on and then adjust the fit, but they also make the diaper more likely to come off when the dog is active. I'm guessing a lot of incontinent dogs are probably older and not as active, but our dog runs, jumps, plays, and moves around quite a bit so he is able to work them off if he really tries. One other thing about the repositional tabs: it does help a lot if you have a dog who still goes outside, because you can easily remove it to let Doggie out, then reuse the same diaper until it's soiled.The actual fit of the diaper isn't quite ideal. If you have a dog who poops in the house, you're ""covered"" so to speak. But for pee, the diaper just barely covers the ""source of the problem."" I wish they extended just a little more in the belly area because it is possible for our dog to get completely untucked, and then the diaper is pointless.Well, maybe not completely pointless. I have noticed that our dog is less likely to attempt to mark something when he has the diaper on. Still, I wish there were a bit more protection in one area!"
132713,2,"I loved my Diaper Dekor for the first six months while my son was exclusively breastfed. But once we started solids, it didn't seem to work at all. Now I have to either put dirty daipers in a plastic bag before putting them in the pail, or throw them away somewhere else. I still like the ease of the system, but a trashcan with a lid would be just as easy and work just as well.Also, my 13 month old son can take things out and throw things into the Diaper Dekor by himself. That's great for him to feel like he is helping after his diaper is changed, but it means I can't leave the thing out, which makes it pretty inconvienient to use. Other models I've seen don't have that problem, so in the end, I wish I'd gone with something else."
3809,1,"Simple, nice sized, and not hard at all to put together. I received this two days after ordering, far before the delivery date! Bought as a Christmas present for my four month old brother and he absolutely loves it! He is just filled with smiles and giggles :) it's a pleasant interactive toy"
149115,1,"I purchased this pillow at 4 months pregnant and have been using it for the last month. It seems to help my back feel better and helps prevent me from rolling on my back during sleep. It is a little difficult to roll from one side to another and to get out of bed to use the bathroom, but is managable. My husband is a little jealous of the room it takes up in the bed, but has adjusted to it. I think this pillow will become more valuable the larger my belly gets."
23400,2,"I got this for my shower, and I finally get to use it and it doesnt even work. The green light never turned on or the fan. The batteries were brand new, so that wasnt the problem. I haven't even used it and it's broken! I have no receipt or packaging to return it and now I have to suffer with a broken pail. First years....what the heck?"
55042,2,"There have recently been several deaths lately due to these. This is a highly dangerous, unsafe type of carrier. There are MANY other types that are safe and beneficial out there--check out BabyWearing sites for more info or check out the ones I mentioned above.

130302,1,"We got this swing as a gift and we love it. I wanted one of those travel swings, but I am so glad we got this one instead. My daughter loves the different ocean sounds and loves to look at and talk to the fish. I also love how you can switch from the cradle motion to the back and forth. My daughter loves for me to change it once in a while. My daughter had colic for the first couple months and this was the only place she would sleep. If not for this swing, I don't think I would ever get anything done around the house!!"
98156,2,"this item is good looking, and go perfectly with the crib, however the color on the photo is absolutely diferentthe color of the honey oak look alamost like natural color."
127395,1,I gave it as a gift to my grand daughter and her parents put it together. It looks and feels very good and solid. My grand daughter looves it!
80937,1,"This is a great shopping cart cover. I purchased it after trying one of those loose ones that cover the cart. My 7 month old frequently falls asleep in the cart, and while our old one covered the cart to protect him from germs, it did nothing to cushion his sweet head from the hard metal. This one is so easy to put in the cart, and has fit all of the carts I've tried so far. It helps my little one stay upright, and has nice soft pillows for when he decides to doze off. It also has straps for toys and pockets for storage (great for tucking in my coupon holder and keys!). It was definitely worth the money and I am so happy I bought it. It also works great in restaurant highchairs too!"
31688,2,"Within two months of normal use, this bottle brush started to fall apart ... it began with the sponge. Small parts were breaking apart during each use. Within another month's time, I noticed that the wire began to twist out of shape, seemingly loosening during each subsequent use. It finally broke rendering the entire brush useless. I will not be purchasing again, especially after reading similar reviews."
1726,1,"Have not had any issue with Pampers, Amazon has a v good price on pampers diapers especially with AmazonMOM along with the subscription program."
87106,1,I have really used this sunshade this summer. If fits really well with both the single stroller and the jog stroller that I own. It comes on and off easily and doesn't interfer with anything. It provided both sun protection and wind protection (when pulled all the way down) so I ended up using it on cooler days also. The SPF is also a bonus as you don't realize how much sun can be directed at the little one even with a regular shade.
144423,1,Great. The best ones on the market. Much better than the off brands. I have tried them all.
170753,0,"I bought this sheet for ourGraco Pack 'n Play Playard with Bassinet, Tango in the TongoThe sheet was surprisingly thin, as others have commented. The sheet even after washing did not soften much. We have preferred to use standard crib sheets, even though they do come un-tucked. My son only uses theGraco Pack 'n Play Playard with Bassinet, Tango in the Tongowhen he has to stay with relatives or we go out of town, maybe 20 to 30 times a year.I would look for something with a little more quality if you are wanting something to fit perfectly."
93188,1,"I bought this child cot for my 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter to sleep on when she comes to visit. I love it. She never did sleep real good from birth but, she sleeps real good on it. I have to watch out or the dog wants to sleep on it also. Good buy."
39187,1,"I found the bedding online before it was available in the stores and was so excited! Then after it became available and saw what people were saying I was bummed, but went and looked at it anyways and cant understand what they were talking about! It isnt the least bit wrinkled or rough, its smooth and soft. I am very happy with my decision and cant wait to put my little girl in her new crib! The only downfall is the price, its way to expensive but like someone else said the coupon definatley helped. Also a little frustrated with how the release dates keep moving up."
100750,1,"our second brand try and they work so much better. no leaks, well, almost no. and my daughter loves the Elmo"
181438,1,"We agonized over the decision to purchase this car seat as the price tag was hefty and really really stretched our budget. Let me just say that after owning it for a few days, I am more than pleased with the purchase. If you are on the fence with this car seat, like we were, I say ""go for it"" you won't have any regrets.We purchased two of these seats. Once for our infant son (for when he outgrows our stroller/car seat combo), and one for my 30 month old son. My son previously had the Eddie Bauer 3-1, which at the time seemed like a good purchase. We needed an extra seat for the inlaws, so we ""upgraded"" to the Britax. Even my husband noticed that we get what we paid for. The Britax fits much more solid in the car (even though we used latch with the Eddie Bauer, it wasn't as secure)...it also is significantly more comfortable for our son. The seat sits higher, which makes the ride more enjoyable, and there is a lot of cushion in the seat. The straps seem more secure and are much easier to adjust based on your child's clothing. Another plus, is that it seems a little narrower (although still very roomy), so the backseat of our Passat Wagon is less crowded than with the Eddie Bauer. I also appreciate that the cover is removable and washable...may car seats are spot clean only, which isn't great when you have a toddler.The biggest point that sold us on the seat, was that after your child hits the 40 pound mark, most seats can no longer be used as a 5-point harness system...this seat is an exception and lasts until 65 pounds. In the end, we are hoping this is the safest way to go.So, hopefully this review will help you with your decision...everything for baby seems so expensive, but this is one purchase you won't regret."
34904,0,"I received this car seat as a shower gift but did not begin using it until my daughter grew out of her infant carrier. She was not yet big enough to face forward, so I used it in the reverse position as recommended for her weight and height and was not at all happy. It sat too upright, took up way too much space, and the straps were next to impossible to adjust because they were pressed up against the back of the seat of my car. I was going to return it but no longer had the box and they would not take it back. When she was big enough to face forward, I gave it another try and loved it. I have had no problems since. Occasionally the straps do twist, but this happens with many car seats and is easily fixed. I only gave it three stars because I don't think it is the best car seat for an infant, but it is great for a toddler."
30861,2,"I have a few issues with this piece of equipment. I bought it to carry our baby's Playtex bottle with us when we needed to travel. The first complaint I have about it is that on the second time I went to use it, the zipper snapped right off. Now, it only has one zipper- verses some products that give you the double zipper for convenience or in case one breaks. So that left me coming up with a quick fix before running out the door. The second thing that left much to be desired was the fact that the ice packs are sewn in, which means you have to put the whole cooler in the freezer. This means you either have to put it in a plastic bag to keep outside germs away from your freezer, or you have to clean it off before putting it next to the frozen food. This product fell way below my expectations- especially for Playtex brand. I would not recommend this for anyone."
138776,1,This is awesome for soothing a kid to sleep and it shuts of automatically. I have two kids and they both have one in their rooms and I have no more problems getting them to sleep.
101688,1,"When we had our second child, we set up a separate monitor in each room. There was some interference, but it was manageable. When we had our third (their ages now are 2,3 & 4), we were forced to put one monitor in the hallway to cover two rooms (with closed doors) - This has been a (barely workable) method for a year now. Then we found out about the Home Connection Monitor, considered the price, read the reviews and finally bought it. THANK YOU SAFETY 1ST!!! You can read the other reviews for the particulars, but I'll just say that we have the receivers two floors below the monitors with little or no interference, the scan feature works great and the bright lights don't bother us. This system is just what we needed."
93340,1,"We love these blankets and so does our daughter. They are soft, lightweight, extra-large and perfect for swaddling. Our daughter is 4 months old and 14 lbs...we are still swaddling her. She loves it and it wouldn't be possible without these blankets. We double them up to keep her extra tight and she sleeps like ""baby"" :)."
26952,1,"what a terrific belly bra!! i wore it walking around at the carnival and i was able to out walk my husband!here are some things i discovered:-normally, if i walk or stand for 20 to 30 minutes my back will ache the rest of the day and i have to take a warm bath to alleviate the pain... but not this time! after wearing the belly bra to the carnival, the only things that ache were my legs and feet. the next morning, i felt NO BACKACHE!! just sore legs and feet! this shows me the band really helps!-it will be hard to sit when the band is on: i have to recline back if i'm wearing it and want to sit, but it's not unbearable, just a bit discomfort because the band is firm and it can dig into your skin.-once the band is on, i ""felt"" lighter, i have better posture and move quite quickly too!-if you wear the band and it's too tight but the next hook up is too large, i say, wait until your belly gets bigger... don't try to squeeze into it! it will be very uncomfortable for you and your baby.-i am about 110lb. i ordered a size small and i'm using the smallest hook setting, it fits snugly. but i think in a few weeks, i probably cannot wear it at the smallest setting nor the medium hook setting until my belly gets bigger to fit the medium hook setting (this is because the hooks are about 3 1/4 inches a part).-it's very hard to use the bathroom when this thing is on, so it's a bit inconvenient having to take it on and off to got to the potty room, especially when i have to drink tons of liquid and baby can be resting on my bladder.-one last thing, after wearing this band and walking around for about 1 to 2 hours, my body started to warm up, and when i warmed up, the band felt tighter and at that point, i didn't feel comfortable wearing it anymore, so i had to take it off.this product is great, the only thing i would ask is for the company to provide more hook settings and have them closer together, similar to the bustier hooks.Prenatal Cradle Mini Cradle is created in U.S.A."
159171,1,"This bouncer was one of the first ""toys"" that my daughter played with. She loved sitting in it and sometimes when she was little it kept her sleeping. A few comments on getting the bar into the holes - sometimes it is very difficult b/c the fabric isn't cut correctly. I don't know if this product will make it for baby #2 because the latch is warn out now. Also - the inside of the fish portion had some sort of condensation after awhile (it was always kept inside?). All in all the bouncer was good for babies but I don't know if I would waste money on the Fischer Price Aquarium line..."
2625,0,"I bought these for my daughter when she was 6 months old so I could skip the night diaper change. Its pretty soggy in the morning, and if I wake up enough through the night, I will change her."
124417,0,"Does the job keeping the lid closed. Easy to operate. Only dislike is that the top clamp is not flush (no pun intended) with the seat lid like it shows in the product image. There is about a one inch space between the clamp and lid so there is room for little fingers to lift seat and to insert between toilet rim, seat and lid, and that's just gross to me. Maybe there are toilet seats that are thicker. The manufacturer should include a pad to insert if you have that space problem because I don't know what to use."
41277,2,"Normally the diapers are great. However, over the past year and from multiple stores - including 4 boxes we just bought on Amazon - we have had issues with the Economy Pack (or whatever it's called). At least half, if not more, of the diapers are defective and my children wake up in the morning with the little absorbing beads all loose, the diaper split open, and a big giant mess. Not to mention a real pain to clean up. We still use these Cruisers, but we buy them in the smaller packs, not this Economy Pack."
110151,1,"The *best* part about these is that milk NEVER collects in the tubing when I use these with the Pump In Style Advanced. When I use the two-piece ones, I always end up cleaning the tubing, which is a total pain. Saving myself that headache makes these totally worth it. As long as you rinse them well, I don't see how they are more difficult to clean than the two-piece ones."
181521,0,Nice gate and great idea but my 6 lb 5 month old yorkie still managed to jump it. 2 minutes and she was out!
5513,0,"Cute and colorful. The Backyardigan pictures did fade off after so many washes, but cups are sturdy and spill proof."
121797,0,"I no longer have my first boppy (purchased 12+ years ago) so when my newest baby was born, I made sure to get another one. But I don't like the new iteration as well as the old. The pillow is now softer and doesn't provide such good support. It doesn't fit as well around me, either, though perhaps that's because my own shape has changed. It's nice to be able to change slipcovers, but if I recall correctly, you could buy aftermarket slipcovers for the original boppy (and I just used a burp cloth draped over the top). I find that regular pillows are about as helpful as this boppy (i.e., somewhat helpful but not extremely helpful), and my back really misses the old one."
150534,1,Fits the 18 X 36 mattress that we also purchased for our old cradle. I was glad to find a waterproof pad along with the mattress and sheet.
24263,0,"This high chair is easily put together, very washable, and gets the job done. However, my son is big in the rump and the seat seems to be a little shallow. He may have difficulty fitting in it as he gets older as he is only 8 months old now."
98659,1,"Of any 5-point harness seats I could have purchased for my 3.5 year old daughter I feel I got the best one. I drive a *small* Jetta (2000) and it is a very tight fit, but I don't know any other seat for her weight range (over 40 lbs.) would have been any smaller. It is a little difficult to install as the width of the seatbelt/seat is more narrow than it should be, but it is still secure. My daughter seems very comfortable in it as she's been falling asleep more frequently on our half hour drive every morning than she had in her old seat. This was an upgrade for us from a smaller Britax model."
158952,2,"I got this set as a shower gift and was quite impressed at first. Then when the colic set in, I started to use these bottles. All they did was leak like crazy on to my sons face. It made no difference with the colic. I really do not like these bottles, they are a pain to clean and I always find them leaking all over my diaper bag too. Save your money.. Ventaire works better! Atleast for me."
2865,2,"I put this on my baby registry pretty much because everyone else I know did. I thought it was one of those items that I just HAD to have, kind of like, diapers, wipes, and boppy. But it has been sitting in the corner for a while now. The first week he came home from the hospital I used it a couple of times but it quickly became more of a pain than a help to breastfeeding. One reason for this is that it's just too bulky. When I put it around me and then my son on top of it he would be almost too high to feed. So it only really worked when he was very tiny. We've used it a couple times more recently to help him sit up but he doesn't seem very happy in it and with all the other things we have for him to sit in, the bouncer, swing and gym, this just isn't very exciting for him. I can definitely see where some people might find this helpful for breastfeeding but I'd borrow one or get it second hand and try it out before spending the money on this one. For us it was definitely a waste of $35 but on the plus side, if anyone asks, we have a boppy! :)"
10943,1,I was a little scared of ordering these since u really dont get to choice wht colo but i chanced it and got some really cute ones that i have never seen in stores so i was pretty happy!
160373,0,"Purchased this at Walmart for $12. I was under the impression that it fit more securely such as clipped on at the handles. It just rests in the hole of the toilet seat and slides around a bit. When lifting my daughter off of the seat, her legs stick to it, it goes up with her and then falls back onto the toilet. She isn't scared too much by that since it is lightweight, but I would think that to be terrifying for a 23 month old just starting to use a big, scary toilet.It seems comfortable enough and my daughter was willing to sit on it for about 5 minutes straight on the first try. Since she loves Dora so much, she really liked this potty seat, however, I can see that being a problem: I may find the potty seat in random places throughout the house since she'll want to play with it! Something I hadn't thought of!Being as lightweight as it is, it's easy for myself or even my daughter (once she learns how) to put it on the toilet very easily.I really do not want a separate potty seat to have to clean so was looking for something like this.Overall, serves its purpose for the low price I paid for it.In hindsight, I would have just payed double this price for the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer (29.99 with free shipping here on amazon.com!) that adjusts to fit ALL toilet seats snugly. The reviews were raving on that one!Good luck fellow potty trainers!"
146925,0,"I got this when my son first started sitting and pulling himself up. We had it on the carpet, in his play-pen area. This product is great looking and I love the fact that it is baby-friendly. My son tried chewing on a few pieces, but couldn't even get a little bit off even with all his teeth. However, he quickly learned that he can pull up each piece and found it fun to throw them all about. It is easy to wipe clean. I would recommend it for harder floors, but if you have carpet, save your money. He just turned a year, and I have already packed it away."
60911,2,"This started out fine but did not contain the stink later on. Husband hated the refills and was more trouble than it was worth. We disliked the specialized refills, the whole process of emptying the Genie and that fact that our son's room smelled horrible. I'm thinking of buying the Diaper Champ since it uses the plastic grocery bags."
145278,1,"We bought the Rainforest Jumperoo for our daughter when she was about 2 months old. It arrived quickly and was very easy to put together. We've had it for a little over a month now and she continues to love it! I like that the music can be set to play constantly or just whenever she moves. She isn't to the point of trying to play with the toys yet but there's plenty for her to do once she gets starts to. For now she's perfectly content to bounce or sway and turn herself in circles (and there have been times when she just sits there ""talking"" to the animals on the console). The only thing I would change would be to add another notch on the straps so that it could be lowered and her feet could touch the ground. Our daughter is about 23"" long and her toes can barley touch the floor. We put a pillow under fer feet and it fixes the problem though. Overall, this is a great product and I would recomend it for any baby who loves to bounce!"
72022,0,"The stroller has a great look and the attached bag is super; however, I have a few safety concerns. I've used this stroller twice and both times it spontaneously folded up - with my son in the seat. I have contacted Britax about this issue and will be sending it to them for repair. If I were doing it again, I'd hold off a year on this purchase until Britax works out the ""bugs."""
157327,0,"The changing table is sturdy when assembled and looks very nice. The instructions are a bit baffling and it is easy to overlook a small piece since each step lists a certain hardware pieces in all pieces rather than assembling it in sections. The parts were all labeled well but there are more unfinished edges than I expected, particular the top of the back of the drawer, which isn't often seen but I would have expected to be finished.This loses a star because the drawer slides are plastic and seem like they will be trouble in the future, and another star for the square-holed screws used to attach the drawer fronts. I found the square holed screws VERY difficult to get tightened properly. They say you can use a regular philips-head screwdriver for these but despite trying various sized screwdrivers I stripped the screws badly during assembly.The substitution of normal screws and metal drawer slides would make this a 5 star purchase."
173386,1,"Our son is 4 1/2 months old now and has used this swing at least once a day since we brought him home from the hospital (usually more). As far as I'm concerned, this is by far the best purchase we made.This swing is great for a newborn with the reclining position and the puffy head rest (that you can adjust upward or downward as baby grows). The slowest speed was a little too fast for the first couple of weeks, but it is EASILY remedied by draping a receiving blanket across the baby's lap so it hangs over the sides a little...it provides some drag to slow the swing down a little. (If you read the instruction manual, it also suggests this.)During months 2 and 3, our son had colic and, sometimes, this was the only thing that could get him to calm down. It was a complete sanity saver...and we have 2 other friends that have also found this swing to be indispensible!He still takes at least one of his naps in the swing. It's also great just to give him a little 'down time' from all his other brightly colored toys that can become a bit overstimulating. He sits and just babbles/coos at himself in the mirror. The removable toy tray is great...he's just started using it in the last month or so. It was nice to be able to remove it and store it in his toy box until he was ready for it. The simplicity of the tray helps him relax. We have so many other toys with 'exciting' things on them that this gives him just enough to touch and tug at as he's relaxing.Definitely worth every penny we paid!"
126114,2,"This an update of a previous review. At first the Huggies helped to eliminate our baby's rash and we signed up for subscribe and save service. The last few boxes, however, have been a real disappointment. When you first open the diaper it seems the leg bands are stuck to the diaper (more so than any other diaper, including previous Huggies) and the strip inside the diaper seems off-center. The real dissapointment, though, is how much they leak even though diaper is fresh and nearly empty. We have had problems with the last 5 boxes (size 3) with leaks around waist and around legs, both in the daytime while playing and at night. We do not recommend these diapers and will be switching brands. After trying Pampers and Luvs we were surprised that Luvs did not leak and did not give him a rash and we will continue to use them."
110254,1,"Very pleased overall. Husband hates the noise but I don't mind it much. The oil or lubricant that allows the seat to glide smoothly seems to be the source, sounds like rubbing a plastic bag with lots of tiny ""pops""Seat is plush and supportive, about the size of an airline seat but without the neighbors! Happy that the seat locks in position (5 choices I think). Just as happy with my feet on the floor, although I have long legs.Motion sickness was unexpected! This has been a problem for me during the whole pregnancy (never before ) and this chair does make me queasy sometimes.Assembly was delayed and tricky because the seat board is not labeled top/bottom or left/right. Felt like a genius when the third try worked: all other orientations fail! Cushions are a breeze."
93525,0,When we first brought this toilet home my son Jordan was eager to learn how to use a potty at the age of two. When he first used this toilet there didnt seem to be a problem. BUt then little brother Gabon couldnt stand to be left out even though he was one so he started using the potty too. It seemed that when we doubled the users the toilet began to leak and created a big mess. Thank goodness the particular bathroom the potty was in was tile and not carpet!
46579,1,This was very quick and easy to put together with simple and intuitive illustrated instructions. The product itself is sturdy and a good price. We have a deep mattress and there's still enough coverage so my infant won't roll out of bed. Very happy with this product!
34881,1,"Well, after reading hundreds of reviews all over the Internet, many of them negative, I decided to purchase this car seat from a supplier with a good return policy. I read the manual, followed the instructions on adjusting eveything to fit my daughter, and installed it into my Jeep Cherokee Sport (with a very small back seat!). I was really worried it wouldn't fit, that the assembly/installation process would be confusing and difficult (based on numerous reviews), and that my daughter wouldn't fit into it properly. Turns out that if you follow the instructions, and have a good attitude, it's all actually a bit of fun. I had to remove the infant head support for my very tall 7 month old, but that was simple and straightforward, and adjusting the belt buckle between her legs was a breeze. Installation was easy, just like the directions said; I did have to use a rolled up towel to get it properly level, but getting it safely secured was no problem. I think the most difficult part was yanking on the seat belt to get it tight enough! And all my worries about it not fitting in the back seat were for naught: it's installed in the middle back, and both my long-legged husband and I have room to put our front seats all the way back and even recline a little. So to all you people reading these horrible reviews, either they didn't read and follow the very simple and illustrated instructions, or they just didn't have a clue. Buy the seat: it's a great fit for my daughter, and it's a great fit for my car, and I'm looking forward to using it for the next 5-6 years!"
56804,0,"I purchased this seat after my daughter did not show an interest in inserts. I liked it because of it's simple design, easily removed basin, and it appeared to be easy to clean. However, I was not happy with this purchase. First, since the splash guard is not removable, that makes it uncomfortable for use with girls. Then, as any Mom who is potty training knows, you have the little one sitting on the seat for quite some time. Since this seat is so small and hard, it made it very uncomfortable for her and therefore she did not want to use it. Finally, the fact that the basin is easily removable, make that TOO easily removable. My dauther would yank it out in a split second and cause a huge mess. However, I think this could make a great seat to carry in your car for emergencies. I put a plastic bag around the basin, put the basin in the seat and it's neat and great for use when stuck in traffic, ""I HAVE TO GO NOW!"" or when the public restroom is NOT something you'd like your child to use."
136335,1,My 6 month old loves her new toy..It was easy to put together and good quality...My daughter loves it..
146094,1,"I bought this for my kid and he hates it, but I recognize that is a function of my kid and not of the product. It seems like a really neat toy to me and I would think I'd enjoy it if I were a kid. Still, know your child, parents. If they're not into flashy lights & music, jumping, etc., this may be as much of a waste of money for you.My one concern is that the music doesn't seem to play when you think it would. Ours doesn't always play when he jumps or when he bats at certain toys. It seems random and that doesn't seem conducive to anything."
78479,1,I purchased this adorable bedding set for my nieces first baby. It is absolutely beautiful and very delicate for a baby girls nursery. It is much prettier in person. It was everything I expected it to be and more.
114668,1,"Well we bought one of these about 8 months ago and LOVED IT! We decided to take it over to the grand parents and there it stayed! lol We've bought another one for our home because we liked it so much. We don't even use the strap to hold him in unless the front tray is removed. Our son is pretty laid back though and not much of a squirmer. lolOne word of warning... The off white removable tray WILL stain with red sauces like spaghetti sauce, so I recommend removing it and using the brown main tray if that's an issue for you. It will stain the brown as well, but it's not as noticeable. Both will become more and more faint over time if you don't reintroduce more red sauces. Honestly, it's not an issue to worry about IMO.Well made, safe and looks good!"
129320,0,Well-made. Vividly colorful and shiny. The center part is a rattle. But our 4 months old boy only shows moderate interest in it. He likes Oball more.
39423,1,"I love Halo SleepSacks and won't buy anything else. They are safe and give my child the feel of sleeping with a blanket covering them, but without the worry. These are a must buy for any new mom's out there!"
99417,0,We have bought these diapers so many times and we did not have problem before. But there were a lot of diapers were leaking this time. Amazon sent us a replacement. Thanks to Amazon
108047,0,"I HAD TROUBLE AT FIRST PUMPING WITH THIS PUMP. I REALLY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING IT. I USED IT WITH MY FIRST BABY. THE DIRECTIONS SAID IT WAS DISHWASHER SAFE, BUT WHEN I WENT TO LEND IT TO A FRIEND, I NOTICED WHERE THE VAVLE IS WAS CRACKED LIKE IT HAD ROTTED. I AM NOW LOOKING FOR A MORE EFFIECENT PUMP, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I STAY AT HOME I REALLY DON'T NEED TO BOND WITH MY PUMP, I WOULD RATHER SPEND MY TIME BONDING WITH MY SON AND NEW BABY."
182482,1,I was very pleased with the time it took to arrive and love the planets and wall products. All are now on display in my classroom. Thanks very much
39049,1,"We love the Svan chair (see my review posted under its listing), and we love this cushion! I got the Sage color and it really looks much better in person (fortunately). It fits the chair very snugly, feels soft and nice, and looks classy. Plus, I've found it very easy to clean. So far, I've just wiped it down, but it's machine washable in case we ever have a messy incident. But the most important reviewer is my 7-month-old -- he loves it and smiles every time we strap him in. If you get the chair, spring for the cushion. You won't regret it."
181609,1,"This hamper seems to be an excellent product. It is well made and sturdy, and has a great cotton liner. The transaction was very easy and the product appeared a few days after the order was placed. Great value and great deal all around."
133863,1,"This is a great potty seat especially for a boy. The splash guard infront is designed well. The splash guard on Baby Bjorn seat does the trick without being too high. I tried the Elmo Soft Potty Seat but the splash guard was too high and it was difficult for my son to get over it and sit down without hitting his private part. The other great thing about the Baby Bjorn seat is that it's adjustable, very sturdy and it doesn't wiggle back and forth on the toilet. I highly recommend this toilet trainer seat!"
172154,1,"My son is going to be 4 months old soon and he is VERY small but very active. I registered for this tub because its cheaper, and much smaller than the other famous Euro Tub. I love this tub and do not regret my purchase. My son fits well in it and it fits securly in my double sink, making it much more comfortable for me to bathe him. I dont think that the tub ""grips"" so well but I just put one of those cheep baby towels under him. There is a space for his shampoos and soaps so I dont have to get the counter as wet. My son loves being in it and i dont expect him to outgrow it until around a year old! I also like that the water actually covers him and hes not soo cold (hes a winter baby). I drains really easily, but we always leave it upside-down on a separate dishrack and store it in the bottom of a sink. I dont see how anyone could find this too big, all infant tubs are and the folding ones really dont work. I love this tub and it makes bathtime fun for me and my very lively son."
116893,1,"I love this first years tub! i spent a lot of time looking at reviews on different tubs and i am glad that i decided on this one! it makes bath time very easy and fun. I loved the sling part when my daughter was tiny and now that she sits up on the toddler side, she loves it! Best baby bath ive seen and used!"
109540,1,"We thought it was gross to use as a food feeder, but kept it in the cupboard anyway. When our son started teething, it took us a few months to figure out that he wanted to crunch on ice. Voila! This was the perfect thing to let him crunch ice to help those gums. Then he recently fell and busted his lip and it was the only way I could keep the swelling down. It washes well in the dishwasher and we have not replaced a bag after ~3 months of use, although we only use it for ice, not food."
176032,2,"I gave this stroller and the company 1 star because they don't have an option to give them 0 stars.We purchased this stroller from an on line source. The good news is we received it within 48 hours. The bad news is that it had a seriously warped rear wheel so we weren't able to use it without shaking our babies head violently. We visited the service center which was 1 1/2 hour ride by car. Not only did we receive the wrong replacement wheel, but it was also warped. I have gone on line and actually tried to purchase the correct replacement wheel, but for now we are waiting. We have owned the stroller for a month now and it is still just sitting collecting dust.Take my advice, skip Maclaren.RR in USA"
66780,0,I have the single BOB with the handlebar console and love it! It's as useful as the stroller itself. But the handlebar console for the duallie BOB does not fit well.It sits half way up the handle bar which gives it a flimsy fit. Either the console material needs to be longer so that it can fit snugly against the stroller part of the handlebar or the velcro straps need to be longer to give the user the option of placing it wherever on the handlebars it is wanted. Seems like a lazy design by BOB. Definitely disappointed but still use it like crazy.
161792,2,"Great idea, unfortunately the &quot;leakproof&quot; description is inaccurate. If you use it in the tub, fine. If you use it on your counter, get ready for a flood. Very disappointing-this product is heading back to Babies R Us!"
109315,2,"I'm in agreement with the other reviewers that these are way too difficult to clean. There are banana bits that seem impossible to dislodge from the seam and around the ring! I also just read a review that this product hasn't even been fully tested to meet requirements for California Prop 65, which alerts consumers to potentially harmful products. Yes, Munchkin claims the product is BPA-free, but there are other unhealthy additives in plastics. Combine that threat with the fact that some of the other parents who have noticed the possibility of ingesting small threads from the mesh and it's just NOT WORTH THE RISK!"
154552,2,"When I first did subscribe and save for these, the price was around 20 then 25 now over 30. Cheaper on other sites now. Serious disappointment amazon."
14741,1,"I also had problems with the bottles leaking out from under the rings. Just like the other reviewer, I screwed them on as tight as I could. I went to the avent website and looked at the FAQ's. They say that the problem is that you're not supposed to tighten them too hard. That makes the base of the nipple wrinkle and lets formula leak out. You're just supposed to tighten them lightly. After I read this, I tried it their way and have not had a single one leak on me since."
97790,1,For my sisters baby shower she got about 20 of these bottles for her little boy. I don't now what she would do without them. Austin will not take any other kind of bottle. These bottles are great because the baby dosn't have to stop eating to let air into the bottle because of the vent and less bubbles get to the baby's tummy because the air doesn't mix with the formula.
136737,1,"we bought this toy for our baby and he LOVES it. The only problem we have is it went through the brand new batteries in FOUR DAYS!!!! He only used it at night, so it was not used THAT much. My husband and I even go to sleep with the story and music, and our baby will turn it on at night and go back to sleep by himself, so is a plus there also. The story and music are great and very soothing so I can't say I would not have bought it even if I knew about the batteries, but I would surly buy the cheaper batteries because it will not matter as far as how long the toy will work and it is not as hard on your wallet. My choice was to buy cheap batteries every time I went to the store and stock up.(Our local Wal-Mart sells a 4 pack of batteries for $.97 so try there for a good price) It is worth it to me because my son loves this so much. Hope this helps."
57949,0,"This bottle warmer was easy to use. I used one water container for a small bottle and 2 for teh larger bottles. The bottles were usually perfectly warm for the baby. However, I didn't start using this warmer until August when I finished breast feeding and it died this week. So I only got about 6 months of use from it. [...]"
37604,1,"i've only tried 5 different brands of wipes since my daughter was born, and the pampers sensitive wipes are the only ones that don't give her a diaper rash. if you find a good product stick with it! we were given a package of huggies brand wipes and i started using those, and as soon as we started using the huggies wipes her diaper rash came back.i wanted to look online for good prices on these wipes and both EBAY and amazon are too expensive. walmart does sell these wipes for much cheaper. its roughly 20 dollars for 840 wipes at walmart.hope this helps!"
24292,1,"The sheet fit perfectly. Make sure you do not put it in the dryer or it may shrink. I believe it says that it's dryer friendly, but do not take that chance."
36085,1,"I won't bore you with details that I'm sure will be obvious to everyone looking at this product, but I will tell you things about these cups (and related products in the ""Take & Toss"" product line) that parents especially will want to know.First and foremost: YES, THESE CUPS SEAL! You can fill a cup with milk or water or whatever, put a lid on it, turn it upside-down and it WILL NOT LEAK. You can even give it a fair amount of shaking before the lid threatens to come loose. In the four years or so that I've been using these cups, I've only ever seen the lid come off (from shaking) twice. The tightness of the lids can be a blessing or a problem for parents; it will prevent smaller (weaker) children from opening the lid, which may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your viewpoint. My now-four-year-old daughter can easily open them and she has been able to do so for at least the past year.YES, the cups are dishwasher-safe. However, I've found that washing them by hand keeps the cups in better condition than washing in the dishwasher. They tend to remain shinier for longer periods of time if you hand wash. Also, if you put a cup in the dishwasher and something else happens to rest upon it, there's a decent chance that the cup will (slightly) deform from the heat and pressure.The cups are pretty vividly colored. Some of the pictures on Amazon make them look almost pastel in color. They aren't. The colors are very primary and rich.The cups are very sturdy and will not collapse. I've rested perhaps 30 lbs on top of a cup (with lid) and it did not crush or otherwise deform.Added bonus: The ""Take & Toss"" line includes several different sized cups. Most of them share the same lids, so you can easily interchange the lids with one another. That was particularly nice to discover."
72462,0,My only complaint is that it stuck to the leather of my car and has been pretty difficult to remove. I would suggest putting a small blanket under it so it wont stick to the leather seats!
108414,1,"Great price, the padding in the seat does stay a bit indented after use but eventually pops back up. Really easy to clean."
114423,1,"I love this seat. If I had it to do over, I would have purchased this alone and no high chair! The seat is portable, easy to clean (love the ability to put trays in the dishwasher), and sturdy. We've used the seat on all kinds of chairs- restaurant, kitchen, dining room, outdoor. My daughter loved the seat so much if we left it on the floor, she used to sit in it, close the straps and sit (and then ask to get out and then climb back in). She now sits in it at the table without the tray to eat meals. I've compared this seat to other similar types of portable seats - I like this one the best for ease of portability, size (it's compact, but comfortable for a toddler), and cleanliness. The tray with insert is a little small, but not really a major drawback. It's also a good option for keeping at Grandma and Grandpa's house for visits (and can be easily tucked away when not in use)."
59169,0,"I like my express warmer, its small, uses less counter space, and it is convenient to use. However, I agree that its a nuisance not having an on/off switch -- with a forgetful hubby (and Ive done it too), we've left it on all day/night. Also, it is hard to tell how long to heat a bottle, and we've had to cool down bottles in the sink. Its a good product, but not great."
28254,1,"I was anxious to get this product, thinking it came with the ottoman too? Nothing in the description to say any different and the picture even shows an ottoman. Once I got it, I emailed the supplier and asked about it. They could do nothing for me. I was a bit disappointed in that. Buyer beware.But, the chair itself is great! Very comfortable. Good cushioning on the seat and back and sides. No creaking. Color on both the wood and cushions are great! Very happy. Now I just have to see if I can order the ottoman to go with it...bummer."
48839,1,"Arrived on-time and it is very good for my 12 months old. I am using it arround the 60In TV, it works very well and stable enough for my 12 months."
46244,1,"sturdy construction and works well for our 11-month old. When I am with her, we are usually out exploring the house together, but this is a good place fo her to play when I need to cook or wash dishes. with the extensions, this play yard is large enough for her to play in our living room. I don't think it is big enough without them."
142554,1,"My mother in law bought this little walker years ago...I have it now and I have no idea how many children enjoyed it before us. But, it is still in great shape, held up wonderfully. We call it our book wagon and our daughter proudly pushes her books all over the place. Great great quality."
10764,1,"I use the pump-in-style advanced breastpump, and I really like that these bottles screw right into the pump assembly. I like having many bottles on hand so that I don't need to wash them every day. I don't freeze my milk in these (I use Gerber bags), but they're great for temporary storage until pouring into the feeding bottles. I use Avent bottles as my baby seems to like the shape and flow of the newborn nipples (these nipples seem too fast-flowing)."
171214,1,My Sister used this tub when she was in her apartment.. they bearly used it... its gently used and well they liked it in there apartment but he out grew it to quicky! its a good buy if you have a small house/apartment!! we liked it for the first few time he got a bath...once he out grew the tub he was placed in the big boy bath tub and he loves it!! and he loves to splash water every where and there's no one to keep him in this toddler tub its a great buy... and we loved it at the beginning of his bath times!!
26313,1,"This is a great, sturdy bag that holds our car seat as well as enough room for a few more things. I would highly recommend this bag if you're taking your car seat on the plane to be gate-checked. This way it stays clean, any toys on the seat stay on the seat, and it's just easier to handle. My husband says it's a little bit bulky and kinda uncomfy to have on your back, but it's much better than trying to carry it in your hands along with everything else."
131174,0,"I chose to add this carrier to my registry based on price and it looked comfortable. Once I get my son into it, he does enjoy it but it is very difficult to get him in and out of it. I feel comfortable once he is in there but it a major process to get him situated and I have put his legs in the arm holes more than once--- you would think that wouldn't happen but it does. If you are on a budget, this carrier will work but again you may find it is work to get baby in and out."
92979,1,"I got this as a fold away sleep option for when my 2 yr old niece sleeps over. Straight out of the box its ready to go! I got a bit curious as to how sturdy it actualy was (it says up to 75lbs) well it held all 244lbs of me no problem!! Mine has the strap not the bar through the center and it wasnt a problem at all! I tossed a little extra padding on just to make it even better and she loves it!! Toddler bedding fits it nicely too which is nice because I dont really like the sheet thing that came with it. Over all, great buy!!"
27903,0,"I THOUGH, GREAT, ALL IN ONE PACKAGE..... BUT THE STICKERS AND CHARTS, ETC DON'T DO A THING FOR MY DAUGHTER.... AND YOU NEED LOTS OF PANTS, ONLY A FEW ""REWARDS"" ANYHOW!"
54949,0,"This is a sturdy little chair. However, it was poorly packaged with some uncovered wood pieces thrown loosely in the box. Some of the wood was unevenly stained with whitish blotching and some burn-like lines on some pieces. It assembled easily. I'll have to repair the blotching for it to be presentable."
55241,1,I went through a few different popular styles before landing on this. I actually would never have bought it because I am cheap...I had it on my Amazon wish list and my husband saw it and bought it. What a wonderful gift to myself to not have to help them up or empty a 'filled' container afterward!! It has been in our main bathroom for almost 3 years; through 3 kids and many guests. It still looks new and has no signs of wear-cosmetic or structural. I scrub it every few months in the tub. It is going on Craigslist now as they are all big enough to get to the toilet without it. Helps the timid ones feel safe and the independent ones seem easier to train if they can go alone. Awesome for letting the boys stand. Also provides foot stability for learning to wipe. Great American made product! A bit of a hassle for big adults (my 6-5 300# husband used another toilet rather than take a side off)but still well worth it.
96781,1,"We love Sleep Sheep - have had ours for over 2 years now and it's still working with no problems, despite my son being old enough to un-strap it from his bed and play with it pretty roughly, including taking the sound box out and throwing it fairly often. My only complaint is that I wish the sound recordings were a bit longer; for example, the ""whale song"" clip is only about 6 seconds long, so you hear the same two whales make the same two calls every 6 seconds for 23 or 45 minutes, which gets old really fast. We typically have it set on the ocean waves, though, so it's not a huge issue. Overall, this is a great product."
82016,2,"While I was pumping and storing breast milk I really liked the bags. They were easy to fill, had the double zipper, and seemed durable. They also stood up well in my First Years storage container for the freezer. HOWEVER, now that I am starting to defrost the breast milk I worked so hard to pump and store, I am finding one in three (33%) bags leaks. The leaks seem to always happen on the bottom seam - the seam that was designed to allow the bags to stand up as you fill them. I now defrost the bags UPSIDE DOWN in a glass bowl. I have to wait until they are fully thawed in the fridge, because I can't run water over the ones that have leaks (blow outs really!). I sure wish they were more durable. :-( I have over 100 bags left frozen. Had I read the reviews on Babies R Us before buying them, I would have bought the more expensive Medela bags. I would not rec. these bags."
114906,1,"This booster seat has been working well for us, and it folds up nice in the car for traveling. As far as boosters go, it is on the smaller side so our son won't be able to use it as long as we had hoped. At one year of age, he is 28 pounds (your average 2-3 year old) and doesn't have a whole lot more room to grow. But for now, we love it and hope to get as much out of it as we can."
47208,1,I researched and studied many different strollers once we had our second child. I wanted a stroller that wasn't hard to push around stores or bulky. My 2 1/2 year old is very mobile and loves to be able to sit or stand. The attachment for the baby carrier was very easy to use. Now the baby is out of the carrier she sits well in the seat. My children are always wanting to see what is going on so the seat not reclining back is not a big deal. It goes back enough so the baby can sleep just like she does in a car seat. The stroller folds up very easily. I have even been able to fold it up and put it in the car when holding the baby - not easily but able to if you have to! This stroller is great for our family. Hope it works well for yours also!
126257,1,"Huggies Snug and Dry are what we have been using with our daughter since her birth. I loved the product and loved the sales I could find on them. Sadly, however, they have changed the product. It now has a blue liner and the outside design is different - more pictures and color. I don't like the way they fit as well as the previous batch. I don't know if I got a bad color batch, but the pictures on the outside of the diaper would transfer to her onesie! Usually the ink would wash out of the onesie, but I don't like that the ink transfers that easily.I must say that even though I don't like the product change, Huggies customer service is very good. I called them about this and they sent me some replacement coupons. I am now using Huggies Little Movers and so far we like them . . . although they are slightly more expensive."
145751,1,I can't think of anything bad to say about this product. It was easy to put together and I like the fact that it can be for a boy or a girl. My son loves it and plays in it all the time. I only wish I bought it sooner:)
33582,2,"This gate is very difficult to handle. I cannot get it to spread apart without turning it on its side and putting my foot on it and pulling up on it toward my chin. I don't find that the memory feature works in the longer positions. I wish I had never purchased it. This also does not work with our baseboards. I know that this is a problem with any gate of this style, but something to consider prior to purchase."
131582,2,"Seems like a good idea, but it doesn't quite fit on many public toilet seats. It does fold up, but is still a bit bulky in the diaper bag since I cart around stuff for a baby as well. Great idea, but not quite right."
77949,2,"Latches were very affordable, however, some have broken after installation, or become damaged closing doors. Others seem to fail when door is opened, while others work fine."
30430,1,"I wasn't sure if I wanted this bath tub after reading some of the reviews, but I got it as a shower gift.I am so happy that I did! My son was not a small baby at birth, so we didn't have issues with his size. He lies on the hammock and doesn't float at all. It's nice cause I have my hands free to wash him while he lies in it. He's 3 months old now.I put in in our bathtub and sit on the side of the tub while I wash him. That way, I can open the drain on the baby's tub when it's time to get out. To keep him warm I keep a washcloth on his chest while I bathe him. He loves his bath!!When he's bigger, I'll probably just wash him in our kitchen sink, but for now, this bath rocks!"
27895,2,"This is the biggest rip off ever! All it is, is a flimsy piece of cloth sewn into a rectangular sack with a velcro closure. It's like a project made by a middle school home economics student. I'm going to use it, because it does serve a purpose, but had I known what it would look like, I would have made this myself. This is worth about $3 tops."
107299,2,"When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills. While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags, that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired. My son's room smelled very badly, even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience. Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine. Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around."
149920,0,"I was really excited about this tray, until I put it in action. It lays on my son's legs and he fusses and tries to push it off -- he fights with it until I eventually give up and take it off. I would send it back, but it's too much of a hassle. It's now laying around collecting dust, and I'm hoping to try again when my son is older so I get my money's worth. To be honest, it is way overpriced! I'd pay no more than $10 for it if I could! Totally useless! Oh well, you live and learn."
88632,1,Pampers is such a trusted name & we love how soft & how perfect these diapers fit our daughter. Amazon usually has the lowest prices on both the internet & those sold in stores!
52956,1,"We were blessed with a very fussy baby who would only sleep when he was being held! Out of desperation, I sent my husband to the store specifically to purchase this chair (we already had the swing). This was the first place my little crankster would finally take a decent nap! He loved the chair, it just cuddled him and made him feel safe. He is four months now and 16 pounds, but he still fits in the chair (he is a big boy!) as long as he is fastened. It is like his own little laz-y-boy chair for watching his Baby Einstein videos. We put the chair right on the coffee table and put in Baby Bach and he is engrossed for at least 30 minutes -- and busy moms and dads know how much you can get accomplished in 30 minutes! I highly recommend this chair -- especially for all those ""chest sleeper"" parents out there!"
122524,0,"Had I seen the box I wouldn't have purchased this at this price. Included are 5 large stars, 45 small stars, 104 mini stars (which are TINY), 100 micro stars (VERY, VERY tiny), 20 astros, & 460 tiny glow-in-the-dark dot stickers. Many of the stars are just outline shapes which are kind of hard to put up. They also have a small amount of putty that can be used for about 20 stars at the most & a star map (a little booklet). The product iteslf is fine, but I was expecting more plastic stars, and I was expecting them to be the small stars rather than the mini & micro ones. The product is durable and my boys love the stars up in their bedroom. I'd say this is worth $10 rather than the $19 I paid for it."
88542,1,"We have tried several other brands of diapers and found that Pampers work the best! They always hold together and rarely leak. Plus, after joining Amazon Mom you can't beat the price. I would reccommend this product without any hesitation."
128282,1,We bought this seat to take with us in case our little boy needed to use the potty in public. If you install it properly (with the front edge slightly over the edge of the toilet seat) it doesn't seem to have any problems. My son has been using this for 5 months when we are out and about and has had none of the problems mentioned from other reviewers. It does bow slightly but not enough to have him fall in (he weighs 32lbs). I like that the parts that touch the toilet seat all fold together reducing the need to clean/sanitize it right there in the public loo with a toddler at your feet.
5112,1,These are fabulous diapers. I've tried other name-brands and bargin diapers. I keep coming back to Seventh Generation Diapers. No nasty odors. No leaks. My baby does not get diaper rashes like he did with other diapers.
9521,1,"i love this potty. baby bjorn makes great products. the quality is fantastic. this will last all of my children's potty training years. my son was 8 1/2 months old when i got it. i put him on it immediately. he really liked it. i want to make potty training fun and introduce it early to make it familiar. i have not put it in the bathroom yet, just in his bedroom. oh, and it matches the colors in his bedroom. i like the fact that the white bowl can come out to dump in toilet, rather than just a one piece potty. he has not really USED it, so i cannot comment on the actual functionality. but i am looking forward to potty training with this potty."
37466,1,I use this pretty much daily to quickly freshen up baby's neck area from where milk sometimes falls. It smells great and doesn't leave a greasy residue. Perfect to freshen baby up.
98617,1,We read numerous reviews before purchasing this car seat and were concerned about the size of this seat. I already own the Britax Mooflage Marathon and had it in my Saturn Outlook but decided to put the Regent in my car and the Marathon in my husbands Volkswagen Jetta! The Regent is a very large seat and probably not the best for a compact vehicle. My 2 year old son loves his new seat but the only complaint I have is that now my little one can't see out of the window but when he gets bigger I am sure it will be fine. Seat is very sturdy and the material is soft! I highly recommend this seat and give it five stars!!!!!!!!!!
118627,1,"I love this product and am so glad I added it to my registry. My daughter is now 5 months old and I have gradually used each item. The digital thermometer works great and it's compact. Also, this case includes a gum massager and as the mother of a teething baby, I'll tell you she loves it when I massage her gums. There are two teething toys as well that we've used and the nail clippers are AWESOME!I would highly recommend this item."
21950,2,"First off, yes this product is priced low so one shouldn't expect great things. But this product is borderline worthless. Very, very soft woods (even on the top surface!), flimsy construction (wood was splitting left and right when I was assembling the unit), and it takes a few hours to assemble. My advice would be to spend the money on a dresser from IKEA. You'll get better quality at about the same, or even lower, price."
66658,1,"My new stroller arrived today, so I decided to give it a spin this evening with my 2 year old. My husband was getting my 5 month old to sleep, so she wasn't in there for this trip.Things I like so far:- There's a strap on the bottom bar that attaches to your wrist in case the stroller starts running away.- The top bar is adjustable, so I was able to make it the perfect height for me. I'm only about 5'5"", though, so I'm not sure how well it would work for taller people.- The stroller is lightweight for a double stroller - much more so than my tandem stroller.Things I'm not crazy about:- The bottom storage basket is pretty much unusable. It is very flat and the lip in the back is not very tall. In other words, don't put anything in there that you don't want to roll out on the side of the road.- The seat backs are not very tall. My 2 year old is pretty big (about 35 pounds), and I can't really imagine him being able to fit in this stroller for many more years. Some reviewers said their 5 year olds fit in there. I don't think that will be the case here.- The seatbelts are also fairly small. I don't know if I did something wrong, but I was having trouble getting it adjusted large enough to fit him.- The child cup holders and pockets are not very convenient. I think I will eventually get one of the cup holders that clip on.Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase, although I wish I would have waited 2 more days to order because the price went down to $180 (I paid $200) for 2 or 3 days. I ordered from Generation Orange, which I wasn't wild about, but that's for another review."
11341,1,"maybe because this is my first baby and i have nothing to compare the monitor to, but it works brilliantly for me. i have it in my home office all day in the plug, and on batteries all night, every night and i change the batteries once a month. the ""humming"" which i guess people are referring to as static is not bad at all (for me). i thought it was just background hum from a little insect destroyer i have, amplified a little (which i'm sure it is still). i think this product is just fine."
37468,1,I've been using this product for both my boys ever since they were babies. This product is perfect because it smells nice and it picks up dirt on my kids so easily. I use it when I don't have access to a wash cloth and water.
48026,0,"I like the stick itself for the quality of the wood and the simple design, however the ball-and-socket assembly design did not work for us. It did not align correctly to line up flat on the wall nor for the 2 pieces (upper and lower stick) to line up just right vertically. I also didn't like the 3/4-inch or so gap between the upper and lower pieces of the stick. But since we didn't have a better option, I modified this one by cutting a piece of similar wood to fill the gap and epoxy it into one solid stick, and then attached it to the wall using a hinge-like bracket (L-bracket would work too) at the top and bottom so it would hold securely to the wall instead of moving around."
84144,2,"I was excited to find a changing pad cover for $10, but I will be returning this item. The material is SO THIN! It's a tad small for a standard size, contoured changing pad so it comes up a bit on the sides which looks very ugly. The purple is a dull lavender, I was hoping it would be a little more vibrant in color. The color I could overlook, but it's so thin and small that there's no point in having it. With a coupon I can get a yard of nice minky fabric in the color I want for less than $10 and make my own nice thick minky dot changing pad cover. Even if you're not handy with sewing though, it's worth it to spend a little more and get something worth having. Don't waste your time or money on this item."
97946,1,"I purchased this (the older version) for my nephew 4 yrs ago a worked like charm. There is not much to be said, but how great this bottles are. Many people complain about having to clean a lot (they have 6 parts or so), which I totally find better than most bottles because this way I am 100% sure that my baby is feeding on something clean and sterilized completely and never do I have the doubt that something might have stayed on areas where a sponge or brush cannot reach.Like I said I used the older version which I think are slightly better than the ""advanced"" version, not only because they were a little easier to put together but because of their vibrant colors. I however, used to sterilize both the nipples and the discs (of both old and advanced version of this bottle) on a microwave proof dish with some water for around 3 minutes and never did I have any problem with leaks or anything.So what can I say, the baby never EVER had any gas or colic, he slept all night in a row since he was around 3 weeks old, and never did I heard him cry because he was uncomfortable on his belly. So with my new nephew coming in less than 2 weeks I have already stacked up with ventaires and ortho-pros, I highly recommend this product ."
181423,1,"didn't believe that this was worth the money and couldn't imagine that it would be more comfortable for my son then an infant seat....but this seat lives up to expectations and is VERY comfortable for my son. He sleeps and plays in this without ever fussing. I don't like these rubber pieces that are on the straps, because they get in the way, but I think they keep the straps from being tangled....they don't bother my son, just the parents as we put him in the seat."
157373,0,"This is a cute changing table but SO many parts, screws, etc. It took forever to assemble. Now I just need to find baskets to fit in the 3 little openings which are about 10x10x18&#34;."
102450,0,"I just got this ""musical"" mobile for my son, it was a gift...(cant complain about that)because it complemented my rainforest theme....but its pretty low on volume, it s not the batteries cause they re brand new..i guess the volume only goes that high..the room has to be completely quiet to barely be able to hear the tunes....i thought it would do more like blink a light but no, all it does is flap the leaves really slow as it sloooooooooowly circles around the little critters...even the ""light"" is barely visible..anyway..i think it could have been better. Overall i give it a 3 star cause its ok, not worth the 35 dollars, 15-20 dollars might have been more appropiate."
24562,0,"A couple of my friends had recommended this gate to us so I thought we'd give it a shot since I really needed something sturdy at the stairs. Problem #1 with this gate is that it does not extend to the width that most staircases are so you'll need to get two extensions per gate. Since we bought two gates, we had to get four extensions so we ended up spending more money than we intended to. Then the vendor CrazyforBabies send them to us without any protection so one of them was cracked and damaged. Problem #2 is that if your child is heavy enough, he/she can open the gates by themselves. My daughter was 2 and weighted about 25lbs when she first opened the gate. My friend told me that she has the same problem with her 3 year old son. Problem #3 is that if you close the gate too quickly, the latches doesn't catch on and the door will swing toward you. Scary thought if your child is there because the corner of the gate can do some serious injury. But other than these problems, it's okay. I had other gates before and it was much worst."
141380,1,"It's a good little walker. It definitely helped with the transition from walking to crawling. The songs get pretty annoying after a while and it occasionally turns itself on in the middle of the night, which is a little creepy. But, my daughter loves it, so it's worth it."
8931,2,"The bag seems good. The problem is that I have received the wrong one twice and had to send it back both times. Amazon appears to have the orange bags stocked where they should have the red ones and becasue they don't seem to pay attention when packing; they put a sticker on the orange bag that says it's red and ship it out. Only time I've gotten really poor service from Amazon, but this has been really poor."
129946,1,"SOOOOOO nice to just drop the carseat into the base and be done with it! Especially when trying to get a 3-yr old into a car seat also. The base in each car is sooooo convenient. Easily enough installed, especially since you only have to do it once in each car!!"
56111,1,"I installed two other brands of safety gates and was thoroughly frustrated with them...one in particular required both hands to operate (meaning I had to set down everything I was carrying to operate the gate), yet my young child figured out how to defeat it easily!Finally I tried the Kidco Safeway and...it just works. Easy for an adult to get through, tough for a kid to defeat, easy to install, all metal, sturdy, and low profile.At one point we moved and I lost an essential piece of hardware for the gate. I called Kidco, they shipped it quickly and at no charge. How rare is that? Kudos to this company."
92466,0,"We purchased this mattress to fit in our 15X33 cradle. The mattress arrived quickly but without any sanitary plastic wrapping. The mattress was an inch shorter than the advertised dimensions. The return process was not very difficult. We were asked to email aBaby and request permission to return the item, which they gave within a few days. After that we were asked to provide a tracking number before our refund could be processed. We found a 15X33 mattress easily from a local vendor that fit perfectly."
179900,1,"Like other reviewers, we have found the miracle blanket to be the best swaddle for our little Houdinis, especially for bigger and older babies. When our baby was an infant, we could easily swaddle her with a normal receiving blanket, but it only took a month or so before she could break free of that and the Halo Sleep Sack velcro swaddle as well, leaving unsafe, loose cloth in the crib. By really securing her arms by her side, this swaddle stays on securely and snugly. She is now 4 months old and still sleeps long and well in this swaddle.Also, a bit of cloth tape to secure the end works well too."
165728,1,"I've always had concerns about leakage during the night time. Pampers baby dry completely resolved this matter. No leakage, no odors, and soft linings~!"
148023,0,"Just bought this bouncer and put it togather. The seat seems soft and well padded which I like, and over all looks super cute. Only problem is the sound bar plays music but none of the moving parts are working. Called fisher price, they were really nice and are sending me a new sound bar. Hopefully this will fix the problem, since baby is not here yet this is not a huge problem for me. Just hope it works!"
152036,1,"I almost didn't buy it because of how much more it costed compared to other pottys, but I'm sure glad that I did! The bag that comes with it is nice, but I have 2 year old twins...so I needed to be able to carry two extra sets of clothes, so I carried the potty in a backpack. I have a boy and a girl and they both love to use their ""to-go"" potty. We always use the handicap stalls, so that we have more room...it's so nice to let them go to the bathroom in public restrooms without worring about all the germs. So to sum it up, my twins and I are VERY satisfied with our purchase."
183112,2,"I got this bag as a gift for my shower, I was very excited. It was perfect and fit everything I needed. well in a matter of last two weeks the left strap riped from the bag. I am left handed and use that side more often. I know have a 8 inch rip in the bag and it is useless. I am very disapointed, because baby tread got great rating on everything else."
148409,0,"i like that this potty is tiny. my daughter's in the 50% for height, and 10% for weight as an 18-month old. it fits her perfectly and will for a while to come. she ends up in a ""squat"" position that is perfect and healthy for having bowel movements.the only thing i don't like about this potty is that it slips around like crazy on the wood floors in our bathroom, making it difficult for her to get really good at positioning herself before sitting down. so now we always put it down on the bath mat and that fixes that problem.there is a potty sold at IKEA for like $4 and it is the same design only slightly larger and it has a no-skid bottom. wish i had bought that one instead, except i don't like supporting IKEA.don't think this tiny potty would work for a boy--pee might splash everywhere as it is not deep. i don't know, never tried it with a boy."
165841,1,"Our grandson lives across the country from us. Your Subscribe and Save feature has worked well, he never runs out ofdiapers, we get an excellent price and my son and his wife think of us everyday.Thanks Amazon!"
79301,1,"We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics. They are all terrific. We're using the fleece at night in the winter, the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall. I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets!"
61954,1,"The purpose for buying these was to transition our son from diapers to underwear. Now at 3yrs old he has successfully transitioned out of pull-ups for good. So I'd say it was a success.Once the concept of using the potty occurred to him, he used these only at night and nap-time. So one package lasted us a long time.They functioned as well as I expected them to. Bowel movements aren't all that hard to change in them since all you do is tear the Easy-Up off at the seams. No problem. Not like you're going to reuse it anyway!They are a cheaper and acceptable alternative to Pull-ups and I will soon be buying the pink version to get my daughter potty-trained."
64743,1,"This is a nice assortment of toys for baby, but some are better than others. My son absolutely LOVES the circle rattle -- it is one of his favorites. We take it with us everywhere. He likes the fish too. It has both rubbery and fabric textures, is easy for him to hold, and has a rattle. He loves to chew on it. He doesn't like the butterfly as much -- the open wing is a little too small and angled for him to grab easily. The phone is okay, but he doesn't find it as interesting and it is too hard for him to enjoy as a teether. The clown face mirror thing is nice for interactive play with the mirror side, but he doesn't usually pick it up to play with on his own, and the squeaker is hard to manipulate."
121934,0,"This stroller is great, when it's unfolded. However, it is difficult to fold up with both baby seats attached. Once it is folded up, it becomes an extremely cumbersome piece of equipment to lift, carry, and move around. Purchase this stroller if you have a big vehicle or are not planning to do much travel with it. When the stroller is being used for its intended purpose, its amazing. It handles well and has many options, just hope you don't need to take it anywhere you can't push it."
104402,1,Item is solid with good construction. The gate is tall enough that I won't have to worry about my daughter trying to open it. I just wished I purchased this one prior to wasting money on the the wood and plastic ones that don't hold up well and can splinter and break easily.
171380,1,"We love this bathtub. Our 2-month old daughter loves bathtime and this tub works great. The sling was great when we were sponge bathing her until her cord fell off, but now we use the newborn side and we have no complaints. The non-slip backing keeps her in place and the storage bin keeps her baby shampoo and body wash within easy reach. The color-changing drain plug is a nice feature as well. Love it!"
70369,1,"The picture doesn't due this adorable set justice. Soooooo much cuter when held in hand. Well made, the materials used work perfectly together.Shipping, as usual, within days."
65738,1,"The first time my baby saw this he was squealing in delight! He LOVES this mobile.I didn't find it hard to put together. It attached fine to our crib rail, with a large screw like device that you have to tighten a lot for it to stay put. But afterward it didn't seem like it was going anywhere. you have to take it off the crib to change the batteries. The light show is cute but to see it you have to have ""regular"" height ceilings(which we do)the fish are bright and cute, good for a baby to see easily. music is cute, and light show is cute.After using it for about a month, it started making a loud clunking sound that I don't know how to fix. I know it is from the mobile turning. It's a shame because it is cute and my baby loves it."
144982,0,They did the job okay but were not as absorbent as they could be. My home made ones are softer and absorb more than these.
143818,1,"I really love the Richell Wood Freestanding Pet Gate. I like that it is free standing and therefore does not mark up the walls and it looks nice - it isn't an eyesore. The only thing I don't like about it is that in order to adjust the width you need to get out the screw driver, but I can live with that. It is a little pricey, but it is good quality and it looks so much better than those crappy plastic gates. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a gate. In fact, I am considering buying another one."
159371,0,I was given the seat as a gift for my daughter. It was a real life saver until she started to get a lot of movement. We she got to where she could move even the smallest amount she would fall over the side and be stuck hanging up side down from her wiast. My Sister also had the same problem with my nephew in the exact same seat. So don't leave your child unattended in this seat not even for a split second.
32543,1,"Hearthgate shipped on time without problems. Installation went reasonably smooth, after drilling the masonry to attach the wall mounts. Once everything was up I was able to adjust to our situation very easily (removing one section allowed for a perfect fit). Our new woodstove insert can blast away and we have no worries that our 17 month boy will be in harms way with this gate system."
137908,0,"I bought this for...me!I wanted it in the bedroom on the nights that hubby had to work--I loved the idea of stars on my ceiling.However, it simply isn't bright enough. I tried it on the floor, on the bed, on top of the tv. I'm really disappointed with it. If I hold it up nearer to the ceiling, it is quite nice--but only with the blue light on. I can't see the stars with the amber or green lights on."
170335,1,I absolutely love this car seat!! It is great. My daughter sits up high and has lots of room. The seat cover is very soft. The covers on the seat belt protect her neck from getting rubbed. The car seat is eay to install and very easy to put hook her in and out of it. It is the best car seat we have ever purchased and we have owned several-we have two children. I definitely recommend this convertible car seat! I tell all my friends who are expecting to spend a little bit more and it will save you in the end from buying seats for each stage as your baby grows. I know my daughter will be using this seat for many years to come. You definitely get what you pay for-It is worth every penny!!!!
59412,1,"I received this for my baby shower and it was one of the most useful things I've owned. It conveniently holds what I need and no need to go looking for baskets or drawers for the needed items. Now that my baby walks, she can even pull out the diaper herself or have my other little one get the things I need. It hooked up so nicely to my dresser with changing top. This was heaven sent and would definitely recommend. :-) Just wish it was a more durable material although I haven't had problems or cracks in it."
81352,1,"I have this stroller/infant seat to create the travel system and I absolutely love it. It's lightweight and with the push of one button, it collapses and it's so light you can lift it into the trunk with one hand! This stoller is most certainly worth every penny and then some, as it's priced nicely."
168424,1,"This is by far the best disposable diapers we have tried. It is amazing the amount of liquid they can absorb; our infant has never cried because of a wet diaper. They seem pretty comfortable and have not caused an incident of any rash. The indicator strip is a little helpful if you need a visual indication of a wet diaper, but we haven't had to depend on it yet. In terms of functionality, I wouldn't look for another diaper."
166010,1,I was a little woried after reading reviewers say the diapers were not the same as the ones in the store.
76619,1,I bought this for my 3 month old grandson. Although he just got it; I had to say it is an excellent mat toy for babies at an exceptional price. His face lights up and he tries to get to the lights when it sounds off. My 2 and half year old grandson thinks it is cool too. So we let him touch the toys that stand up so he can help make noise for the baby. I am happy I decided to take a chance and buy this. thank you Mickieps It came on time with no hassles
180526,1,"This bag is huge and carries everything for a baby. Here's my list:In the 3 small pockets in front - 3 bibs, 5 small washcloths, 5 of those just-add-water napkins, my phone, a pen and car keys.In the bag - 5 diapers, 2 musical toys, a whole package of wipes, nursing wrap, my wallet, a blanket, changing pad it came with and a full bottle of hand sanitizer (not the little travel size) and 2 spare onesies.There is another pouch inside where I keep ointment and nursing pads.In the back of the bag, there's a pouch area where I keep a plastic bag and some ziploc bags to put dirty diapers in if there's no trash around.The strap even has a pocket where you're supposed to keep your cell phone. That's the ONLY complaint I have about this product; it's a very narrow pocket and a phone the size of an iPhone will not fit there. It would be a very convenient place for the phone too. So I keep lip balm in there instead.My husband and I take this everywhere we go and if I'm carrying it, it acts as my purse also. We're both very happy with this product and the dragon image is just too cute!"
59152,0,It's nice that it's small and doesn't use a lot counterspace. I wish it was more accurate on the settings. You really have to play around with it to know what temperature setting suits you best. Bottle sometimes comes out still cold or too warm.
95549,1,I ordered two of these hammocks and was surprised on how quickly they arrived. Hammock is definitely jumbo -- both kids' stuffed animals fit and there is still room. Definitely recommend this product.
28077,0,"I agree with other reviewers that you can't store very much in these but I liked to use them to store the fresh milk while it was freezing. Then when the container got full I would move the milk into gallon storage bags organized by date. Any way you look at it milk takes up alot of freezer space, this was just a good spot for me to put my freshest milk for freezing."
8166,1,I absolutely love the blanket. It's soft and large. I plan to get another one.
95953,1,"After doing lot of research and reading through many reviews, I brought this for my wife (5 months into pregnancy). She absolutely loves it and is now able to sleep through the night comfortably. I would highly recommend this."
116369,2,"The gate really does look nice. That's about it, though. The quality is very poor and the hinges are made of very cheap and flimsy black plastic. Because of this, it's easy to open the gate and not realize the bottom portion is still ""locked in"". This is because the plastic hinges are so flimsy that the gate door can kind of ""twist"" so that the top portion moves outward a good distance while the bottom portion is still closed. Also, the description isn't very clear (nor are the details on the box) about the extensions. The gate's advertised maximum width of 40.5"" includes the extensions.If you want a similar design with a far better build quality, get the First Years Hands Free Gate instead."
41467,1,"I always use pampers cruisers for my daughter. Normally I can find the large (>100) package in local stores like Target / Costco. However they seems to disappear since 2 months ago - Target only had small packs, and Costco started to sell its own brand. So I switch to Amazon."
138801,1,Got this for my son and he loves it! Can't sleep without it. It's bright and the batteries last for quite some time for being used every single day.
48182,0,"I purchased these wipes because they were cheap and showed the cotton symbol on the box...I received them and I now understand why they're so cheap. There's not a whole lot of wetness to them and they're kind of thin and stretchy. I prefer my baby wipes to not be translucent and have some substance to them. I like to be able to use one wipe at a time, not doubling up on the wipes to avoid getting feces or urine on my hands. On the up side, they do have a nice lavender scent, they are soft, and the box is refillable. I would suggest using these to clean up messes on hands, faces and wet diapers...not for use on poopy bottoms."
3346,0,"Instead of these, buy SoftShells. TheraShells look under the shirt kind of funny, they don't feel as good as SoftShells either. On the other hand, except the look, there is not much to complain, they do the job well enough."
97928,1,I can't believe everyone is having such problems with these bottles! I love them...they take all the bubbles out of the formula. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND them. I have not had one problem with them.
138543,1,"I purchased this for my 16 month old twin boys and they love it! When we put them to bed, they point up at the ceiling and wait for mommy to put on the stars! The turtle lights up the whole ceiling and down the sides of the walls alittle bit, and this is a large bedroom! I think I just might get one for my bedroom!"
153749,2,"I recieved the monitor has a gift. I used it when I was at my parents house, because the babys room is on the other side of the house. I kept hearing other peoples conversations and I thought that was normal. Then I started hearing ticking sounds, then one moring I woke up and it wasn't working. Luckly the baby was looking at her mobile just laying there. Then I would hear strange sounds coming from both ends. This is my first time using thos product and my baby is seven months old. I am very upset about this monitor........"
139155,1,This is my 3 year old's favorite x mas present . My nephew got the other brand and this one is better all around .
15888,1,I debated between this bundle me and the original but decided to spend the extra money on this one. I'm glad I did as my baby was born in January and this is warm and has a nice thickness to it without being too bulky.
76598,2,"I noticed that most of the reviews on here are from people who purchased this as a gift for an expectant mom. As an expectant mom myself and someone who just received this as a baby shower gift, I have to say that I am not impressed. The bottle itself is big and from afar looks cute. If looked at up close, everything in the bottle looks cheap. Once you open the bottle, everything feels like cheap lightweight plastic and some pieces have sharp edges. There is no way I would EVER give this as a gift let alone use any of this stuff on my own child or someone else's child. Please do yourself a favor when spending money on someone when looking for a baby shower gift 1. stick to the baby registry if the mom has one 2. just because this bottle has a lot of ""goodies"" (toddler cups that are small, bottles, bottle brush, brush for hair, rattles, etc.) inside doesn't mean it is good quality. Put together your own gift basket with a few good quality items that you yourself would like to receive. This bottle is really just a waste of your money as no mom is actually going to use or keep this item. And for what some people pay for this thing (as I have seen it sold else where up to $50) you can do so much better in the gift department. This is going in the trash!"
107205,2,"My daughter was completely breastfed until 6 months of age, during which time the Diaper Champ worked reasonably well. As advertised, it was convenient to use regular trash bags, and no problem to operate and empty it. My one complaint during that time was that sometimes, no matter how hard you try to seal a diaper with the tapes, it may not keep everything in (especially before babies go on solids), and the diapers would leave...ahem...&quot;skid marks&quot; down the sides of the chute (sorry). That was not pleasant, but we could deal with that.Then, my daughter started solids, and the Diaper Champ quickly lost its appeal. Yes, we emptied the pail when it was necessary. Yes, we emptied it outside. Yes, we aired out the pail outside and Lysol'ed the inside each time before putting in a new bag. But as long as the dirty diapers were in there, my daughter's room stank. We finally ditched the thing and got a Diaper Genie. Yes, the refills are not that cheap, but they are easy to find, and I don't find the &quot;deodorized&quot; smell of the plastic film offensive at all. It's much better than the alternative with the Diaper Champ (which my husband and I started calling the &quot;Diaper Chump&quot;)."
172394,0,"This tub has it's pros and cons. Actually I think the cons outweigh the pros.First, it's a bit difficult to ""snap"" on to the tub. Also, no matter how long and how hard I try to ""drain"" the water out of it, it still has some water left it it. Not fun when you go to grab to use it and old water drips out. But the worst thing about it is, it's impossible for you to wash the baby's bottom. After each bath, I still have to take her out of it and wash the rest of her body that I can't get to when she's sitting in it.Otherwise, she does sit good in it and seems to enjoy being in it(despite the red marks she gets along her chest from leaning over to splash the water)If I could find something better, I am going to get it instead. But for now I will have to do with this one."
27413,2,This was sold together with a crib sheet and a Baby Bjorn but it's almost too small. Mattress would only go flat after lots of pressure was applied. Crib sheet is even smaller. Fortunately it will be used by a one year old who is large enough to flatten it but it would have been unsafe for immediate use by an infant.
92313,0,"The only paci my daughter would take at all is the Soothie. So when the bottles came out I bought some. She loves the bottles and in general I think they are great. They do not leak, at least have not for me. The problem I have is somehow when she is drinking the nipple collapses inside the bottle and she winds up wearing all of the formula in it. The nipple is snuggly in place and the ring is as tight as I can get it. I do not understand why this is happening, I have never had any problems like this with other bottles."
149970,1,this product is not too bad. was hoping for something a bit sturdier but I understand the safety issues in case of a crash. it is a good table that works when travelling.
46806,1,"This letter adds a whimsical touch to any room. It looks better on a shelf than on the wall, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. It would be a good book end, not to hold the books up though because it doesn't have a lot a weight to it, just for looks."
96909,1,"We put this on our registry after seeing recommendations and reviews online. Sure enough, it's been very helpful in getting our newborn to sleep. It offers soothing sound that functions as white noise, too, so that he stays asleep. We're not tiptoeing around, mind you, but just appreciate that steady sonic wallpaper..... I imagine it wouldn't work for everyone, but we've found it to be great. 45 minute setting is about right, though I wish you could just burn up batteries and keep it on continuously..."
63083,0,"Many people have posted that Medela provides tubing for free. I called the customer service number and that was not the case. I paid $10 for two tubes. I even mentioned that I had been told the tubes are provided for free, but the representative said that's not the case. Anyway, I need extra tubing, so I paid for it."
153487,0,"I bought this for my 3 year old grandson, and he loves it, however, I admit I am very disappointed with the product. I wish I had looked around more before purchasing them. It comes 24 tablets to a container, and we had to use two tablets to make the water have more color, and I only filled our average tub with less than 1/2 tub of water. It was very translucent with only tablet, not really a noticeable color, so we added another tablet to have more color.Last week while out shopping with my daughter at a specialty toy store, we saw another similar child's bath color product, it was priced at $7.99. It contained 30 tablets, with no shipping costs. By the time I had paid for the shipping on my bath product it was close to $11.00, so the value for quantity and quality really shrinks. I have since seen this same product at Babies R Us, their price is $7.99, a much better value.Then I discovered another source to buy the color tablets, because my grandson does like them, and he did have fun with them, so I want to buy more, but will not buy this small 24 tablet package ever again.YOUR BEST DEAL IS RIGHT HERE AT AMAZON!!!!I went to the Beauty section, and also Toys and Games, and found a BIGGER Sesame Street container, it has 100 tablets!!!!!! for the price of $13.15 This is a much better deal. I have it on order, and am sure my grandson will have long lasting fun making colors, even if we have to use two, it will last much longer with 100 tablets!Here is the actual name for the bigger package, go to either Beauty, or Toys and Games, enter search for ""Sesame Street Fizzy Tub Color Tablets - 10.4 oz. by Sesame Street""Honestly, I feel quite disappointed that Amazon does not cross list products side by side to compare them. I always read the reviews on products before I buy them, so I was aware of the other '3 star' reviews.I hope this is helpful for others who might purchase this....don't buy this smaller version, get the bigger one, it is a better value for your money, even with Shipping & Handling. You will have many, many happy baths with big smiles..."
176143,0,"The delivery was prompt and I like the product, but I was ordering this for the pop-up box in the photo which showed some flamingos and I received a little princess box. I suppose you can't escape the Disney machine, but I ordered these for my son who is not into princesses (yet). I think the description should mention that you get whatever you get for the box design."
26262,1,"We've used ours several times for airline travel. I appreciated it the MOST when I travelled by myself with my 2 year old. Not only did it hold her Britax Roundabout perfectly, but it had TONS of room for all the extra toys & goodies I brought along for the plane ride. I was able to carry it on my shoulders, along with my backpack, and push my toddler in her stroller. In line, I easily dragged the bag on the floor. Very, very durable!"
34320,0,I like this lotion generally. It has a good smell and works great for preventing diaper rash however it does not work too well for treating it.
112392,1,"Huggies just did not make the grade. For our child's bottom, Pampers Cruisers have been a perfect fit- - we as parents and our child have no complaints - - and buying them from Amazon has been a delight.We usually buy two cases at a time -- being shipped right to our door can not be beat. This is a bulky item to transport and just carrying it upstairs is a delight."
99677,1,"No complaints here! My son can wear these for 12 hours overnight, and the (very full!) diaper doesn't leak. These diapers have a print of a Muppet on the back, and when my son is crawling you can see two little Muppet eyes peaking over the back of his shorts. Pretty cute."
25691,2,I bought these when my son was a month old to keep his head straight while in the car seat to help with an issue with his neck muscles. It worked until his head grew large enough that we had to spread the Velcro. When we did that he started getting an irritation on the back of his head. I saved them for when he is older. he is now 8 month old and I can not find the proper configuration for them to be comfortable.
168278,1,"Great product and so happy that I am able to buy them and get such a great price, I do the subscribe and save and get a huge amount for a fraction more than a tiny box in the stores."
137485,1,"I bought this for my daughter because we moved into a new house and she was scared sleeping. This ladybug works awesome, it lights up the whole room in either (pink, green, or blue stars) and shuts off after about 45 mins on its own. She didn't sleep for a while the first night because she was too busy playing with it, but now she wont go go bed without it. Worth every penny. I just wish that it played some music as well, but other then that its a great night light for kids."
108463,0,"My son loves anything Cars or Trains, so when he recently started showing some interest in the toilet, I thought it might be time to get a kiddie size seat in preparation. I ordered this Cars seat because of the Cars theme, of course, the inexpensive price, and because it had overall good reviews. It was easy to assemble, but when I put it on our oval-shaped toilet seat, it is apparent that it is not going to stay in place as it slides way back on the seat. We also have a round toilet seat upstairs and it still slides about two-inches backward and forward on that seat. I think that is going to deter my son from using it, but so far he is not actually interested enough in the toilet to try sitting on it. I am not sure if we are going to be able to use it when he is ready, so I am pretty disappointed. Also, I accidentally ordered TWO of the damn things, so now I will be stuck with two seats I cannot use which kind of kills the point of purchasing an inexpensive seat. Oh well, lesson learned!"
2822,1,"I recieved a boppy for my second child and I wish that I would have had it to nurse my first child. It is wonderful to nurse with; it puts you and the baby in a great position. Not only that, but the whole family has found a use for it. My 13 month old son lays in it and my husband uses it as a pillow for the floor. We love it and would recommend it to everyone. If you can only splurg on one item, this is it!"
94498,2,"Do NOT buy these bottles!! Save yourself from a lot of stress & frustration!! Our Avent bottles leaked all the time & our daughter had a lot of gas. I called Avent customer service to find out how I could get my money back & they were extremely rude to me. I very politely explained my problem with the bottles & the customer service representative immediately got a rude tone with me and said ""There is nothing I can do for you - we do not give refunds. The problem is not with our bottles - you just are not using them properly."""
111997,1,"I love this diaper bag. It is a large bag with plenty of pockets, so you can carry everything that you may possibly need. It is also cute and easy to clean. I would recommend this bag or any other Kalencom bag to anyone."
179580,1,"I purchased the travelmate to fly to Europe alone with my 18 months old daughter. As I had booked a seat on the plane for her, I figured this was my best option. Walking around the airport with my daughter in it was no problem at all. However, getting the car seat out of the travelmate and watching my daughter at the same time as we got to our seats in the plane was another story. It's not as easy as it seems especially when in a stressful situation and if you have not practiced much beforehand. A stewardess ended up helping me and we were all set. So my point is if you are alone with your child, practice really well attaching and unlocking the car seat before your trip. Better yet, travel with another adult if you can.On a final note, my daughter ended up spending the night on my lap in the plane, and not in her carseat!"
96933,1,"This product was perfect for what we needed. It's quality and does the trick. Out of the four sounds, I prefer only two, (waves and rain). Still I would recommend this product. Besides it soothes our newborn, it helps me sleep as well."
174014,1,"When I first brought my daughter home from the hospital I expected that she would like this swing because it looks so cozy and comfortable. I was wrong. She didnt like her swing, bouncer or bassinet. She only wanted to be held, so I obliged. After two weeks I attempted to put her in this swing again. At that point she could see better and became instantly mesmerized. I assumed she was watching the birds that swirl and spin above her, but my boyfriend has pointed out that there is a large circular mirror in the middle of the birds and we believe our daughter may just be watching herself! Either way she will sit quietly in her swing or fall asleep staring at herself and allow me some time to cook or clean. This swing is amazing and the colors are very neutral. They blend nicely into the living room. It also looks very soft and comfortable."
6281,2,"We bought this monitor after our old Safety 1st Monitor finally died after 2 years. The old monitor was great, so we figured a new Safety 1st Monitor should be even better, right? Wrong! The picture was absolutely horrible. We took the unit back to Babies R Us a week later and got our money back. If anyone could recommend a GOOD monitor - please let me know!!!"
56162,1,"It took a little time for my husband to install the gate with the installation kits, but once up, this is a great gate. I feel such a relief not to worry about our baby falling down the stairs."
28937,0,"This glider assembled easily and works great. Seems very solid, as though it could last 20 years. But it isn't very comfortable for long sits, and the back doesn't recline. Of course it doesn't claim to recline, but if I was doing it over I would spend a bit extra for one that reclines and has a little more padding or spring under the backside."
95600,1,The hammock stretches to a large size and seems very sturdy. It working great for adding vertical storage space while not taking up room I would otherwise be using.
7242,1,"This is a great bed for a toddler. It's easy to assemble, it's light, solid, and it looks great! We've had a DaVinci crib before this bed, and that was also a very good purchase. Recommended"
125445,1,"this is the best teether ever, it is kinda big, but it's not a pacifire, it's a teether, my babygirl just love's it and i think it really sooths her achy gum's. we have our's in pink, i do recommend this product, it's worth every penny."
108548,2,"This is a very cute seat... it was easily assembled and worked as we had hoped, potty training progressed. The guard made it a little difficult for my son to get onto the seat himself, but the handles are genius! My biggest problem w/this seat, is that because the cushion fits into the seat base and the guard fits into the base & it all clicks together... unfortunately this leads to urine getting where you don't expect it to and before you know it... you're sniffing around your bathroom like a bloodhound. And we wiped this down pretty much every time it was used... but to have to unassemble it and wash each component after each use... is a bit much to have to do. It's really disgusting actually."
75213,1,"Picking the right breast pump is a hard decision because you can't take it for a test drive, it can't be returned and it's not cheap. So I did a lot of research before purchasing this pump. All in all I am very happy with my decision.I have been pumping 2 - 3 times per day while at work for 6 months. Many reviews criticized that this pump did not come with a carrying case. I actually preferred this, so I could pick out a bag of my choice. I also like that it is not built into a big bulky bag. I purchased a lunchbox that fits perfectly and is discrete. Since it was made to be a lunchbox, it is insulated and perfect for transporting milk at the end of the day.Recently right in the middle of using the breast pump, it stopped working. The pump continued to make noise, even though it sounded slightly different, however there was no suction. I called Lansinoh and with no hassles they gave me a return authorization. I mailed back the parts using priority mail on a Tuesday. I received a brand new pump on Friday of the same week. I received GREAT customer service. My only complaint is they made me return all original parts. As these used parts can't be reused, they will just end up in a landfill. I don't understand why I couldn't keep the extra flanges, bottles, power adapter etc."
178125,1,Excellent product. Just need to buy baskets for storage. Highly recommend. Beautiful wood color - matches furniture very well.
4660,1,"We've been using 7th Gen diapers for years now, and the recent changes to the diapers are great improvements. Will continue to use them till all kids are potty trained."
166097,1,"Great deal on diapers. I was worried about potential leaks but I haven't noticed them happening any more often than the store brand diapers we usually get. Potential leaks at night have been avoided because we layer a cloth diaper over the disposable, and honestly very often the cloth is still dry by morning. Generally if he has too much to drink before bed or if he sleeps an extra long time. Either way, love the value and these do just as well as other diapers we've bought, so I'm satisfied!"
181733,1,"I love my Maya wrap sling. It took me a while to get the hang of it but it was worth it. My baby is ten months old and we still use it when I don't feel like bringing along the stroller or when he feels like being close to me. He can even fall asleep in it when we're out and about. Definitely a great item to have in your car for unexpected outings and for travel. It's compact, easy to clean, and safe to use. Watch the video provided for all the different uses. Look for a subtle print as it should coordinate with what you usually wear."
159853,1,"Our key requirement in a travel stroller was one that we could take as carry on luggage as our airport does not support gate check of strollers. This does fit fit that requirement. Further, it was the cheapest of the carry-on size strollers that we found. And it maneuvers quite ok even over uneven ground. Best is backwards due to its nice big rear wheels. One handed pushing is possible just not for very long. So, overall, we're happy.Things we'd like to improve: the fold is a rather tricky to get used to. But you do eventually figure out how to stay relatively clean during folding. We'd like the ability to raise the handle. We'd also like the ability to easily store the rain cover somewhere on the stroller even when folded. And the carry bag is cheap, cheap, cheap quality. It tore the first time it was used."
121405,1,This is by far the best walker I have found for the cost. I have looked at several. It is easy to assemble. Can be lowered for little legs. The babies at my house love the tray and the attached toys. So far three relatives have ordered this same item!
86494,1,"Our baby was a very loud sleeper when she was younger and this saved us many many trips to her crib. For us, its better than having her in our room because we didn't have to switch on a light to check on her! The battery life is very fair, we keep the receiver plugged in every night and we never have a problem with the battery dying during the day for naps or in the evening when we're around the house. We can go as far as the neighbors house and still get good reception. The only drawback I can see is what others have mentioned, there are only two channels. My neighbors had family visiting a few months back and told us that their monitor picked up our nursery. Kind of strange, but I'm not so paranoid as to believe that criminals are spending $150+ to watch sleeping babies. But maybe I'm wrong. I just know that we love this monitor!"
96730,1,"Perfect for comforting baby at sleep time, and as he or she gets older,other functions graduate too.So soft and adorable, a perfect future favorite lovey. Perfect shower gift,perfect must haves for new moms. Sounds really work to soothe baby."
161155,1,"This is an ideal gift if you don't know the sex of the baby and don't just want to buy clothes.All pieces of this kit are made toughly, (although the zipper of our one was broken) and are still in use now our baby is one year old. The brush and comb are just right for baby soft hair, and the sturdy grips mean that baby can have a go at brushing his own hair if he feels like it. The nail clippers work well as long as your baby is not too wriggly (tip: wait till he falls asleep!) and the scissors seem about as safe as you can make a tool designed for cutting.The emery boards are a bit of a mystery - why would you want to file a baby's nails. No doubt there will be parents who have an answer for this though. The toothbrush is a good first brush for a baby, being quite soft it helps him get used to the idea of having it in his mouth.A good quality product and a useful gift."
84124,2,"I loved the look, the feel, everything about this chain until this weekend. I bought at christmas for my son, he is now 4.5 months (2 months later) and teething, puts everything in his mouth and sucks on everything. Well the wetness caused the wood to crack on three beads, I noticed it in time, a small bit of pressure with my fingers and was able to break all three beads into pieces. I am so glad this didn't happen when my son was playing with it, easy to choke on these pieces. If you use this item makes sure to check often for cracks!"
306,1,"I love these. They are less expensive than the other Pampers and they are softer and work very well. I used the Pampers Swaddlers when my son was smaller than size 2 and after that I switched to these. He is 26 month old now and he is 23 pounds and he is using size 5. He is on 3 percentile weight and I do not go with the weight chart for these diapers as in that case I have to use size 4. You will know when to switch to upper size, when it gets full over night or it leaks # 2. I guess soon I have to switch to size 6 as it is almost exploding in the morning. I used costco brand and Huggies, but I did not like them. With the subscribe and save the price of these are better than the other brands."
163385,1,I order this high chair for baby shower gifts. I also ordered them for my greatgrandkids and they are absolutely great. They make tending too and feeding so easy and they provide a safe place for the baby.
162623,1,"I personally like this tub. The only time it leaks is when it is too full and it leaks through the hinges. Yes, he looks a little uncomfortable because he is outgrowing it, but it works. It needs to be a little longer. He loves the water, so bathing him is easy. I never put the tub in the sink, I put it in our big tub, which works really well. I love the fact that it folds up, makes for easy storage. I also really like the cut out by the feet to hold shampoo and baby bath bottles."
153642,1,"The sage green color and the little toile print is so pretty and very appropriate for both girls and boys. I like the fact that the cover is washable, soft, and comfortable. It is not made of a typical plastic that will eventually crack, peel and become unsightly. I have six grandchildren in all shapes and sizes, and the Graco,Harmony highchair is easily adjustable and can be folded and stored away between visits. It is strong, safe, and reliable. I am confident that my grandchildren are secure when they are buckled into this quality highchair."
68560,0,"I like this item, but was unset when I had it all together only to find out that one of the snaps that hold the storage basket was missing. When you reach that point practically the whole thing is already together. Very disappointed but will keep it to avoid extra charges."
74675,2,i ended up buying a different one... it's cheap and it was shipped fast... but it's not all that great
22474,1,Very easy to put up and take down for visits from the grandkids. Love this product!
151846,2,This might have fit better on a larger cradle but it was WAY too big for my regular sized bassinet. I kept it because I loved the print and it was super soft but had to really tuck it in good because of how big it was.
40189,2,"I didn't find that these are worth the extra money that you pay. After wearing these for 2 days, my daughter developed a pretty nasty diaper rash. After about a week and a half of not clearing up, I decided to put her back in some Huggies. Her rash cleared up within 2 more days. That is not why I am giving them such low marks though. EVERY morning, my daughter would be drenched from the Cruisers leaking! We didn't and still don't have that problem with the Huggies. I will save myself grief and money and stick with the good old Huggies."
22375,1,"We really like this Pack N' Play, and use this as our baby's primary bed, rather than purchasing a separate crib. We did add a separate mattress from IKEA. Easy to pack up and set up, my only complaint is that the included base does dip a lot after extended use. It's not a problem with a very firm mattress, but now that we use a slightly softer one, I flip the base every time I change the sheets to keep the middle from sagging."
30706,2,"this item as come very close to being thrown out the window in our house! The range is quite poor and is constantly beeping when it loses a signal, range varies due to walls and/or doors and not neccessarily distance. Battery life poor which leads to more incessant beeping....beep, beep, beep. I've heard more beeping from this unit than I've heard my baby making noise. The belt clip is useless also, constantly falling off. Very irritating device."
17768,1,"I have had an adjustable sling before that I never liked. I found the Peanut Shell with this baby (Mary Ann) and have been using it since her birth 7 weeks ago. I absolutely love this sling and would recommend it to anyone! Oh, did I mention that Mary Ann is our 10th baby? :o)Blessings,Lori"
139581,1,"We have an awesome little girl who just turned 4, and my husband and I thought she would like this. She has Autism, and isn't easy to buy for! She LOVES this! It is amazing how well it projects stars and the moon onto her ceiling, I had no idea it would be as amazing as it is. Even her 8 year old brother loves this thing, and her dad and I like it too. =) The colors are bright and vivid. Beautiful! If you are thinking about getting this, stop thinking and just do it! =) Your little one will LOVE it!"
123723,1,"This playpen is another great item from Graco. Fun colors for infants that will catch their attention. It has enough room for babies to play into. Each sides has colors for eye coordination and activities that they can explore once inside the playard. Another plus thing is the sturdiness and can be easily transported from my house going to grandma's and so fort. The bag is really helpful when carrying it. At first, my daughter feels awkward while inside, (cause she might feel that she's alone), but gets used to it and enjoys it now every single day. Now, I can leave her there, seeing her through the mesh without worrying that she might fall or get dirty stuff. If you are looking for a playpen that is useful for a long time, you can't go wrong in buying this. Thanks Graco and of course, Amazon! Great!"
142995,0,"After not using a wipe warmer for the first couple of weeks and getting to listen to the blood curdling scream emitted every time the too-cold wipe hit the infant's bottom, I now consider this thing a &quot;must have.&quot;That being said, the top on this puppy is NOT designed well. It often will not close all the way resulting in crispy wipes and it is attached to the warmer body by two miniscule plastic pips that break easily, rendering the whole thing a lot harder to use.I'd pass on this one."
135067,1,"This extractor is great for a VARIETY of uses. It's great for it's intended purpose, such as bug bites, bee stings, etc., but it is also great for getting out splinters, glass slivers, blackheads, etc. It has an incredibly strong suction capability. Yet, is not painful, and does not leave a mark."
107174,2,"We registered for this item because of the convience of the trash bags. We are now finally giving up on this item and purchasing the diaper genie. We changed the bags several times a week, bleached the pail regularly and used the odor control disks. Nothing works! On top of this, the foam seal came unglued and twisted making it usless and of course even more odorful. When you end up taking each of the diapers outside to the trash as they come, the point of having a diaper pail is diminished greatly and I would rather spend the money on the special bags. Needless to say, it was a waste of money since we are now going to by the other brand anyway."
149482,1,"Pros: Best value goes to Pampers Baby-dry. If you are patient enough, Pampers and Huggies are alternating their sales at amazon pretty much every other month. They sure beat everywhere else, including Costco, even with coupon. Think about the hassle of collecting coupons and the funny looking of store checker, and getting only a jumbo or mega that lasts 2 weeks if you are lucky. Also, Pampers is slightly cheaper than Huggies, yet larger.Cons: Workmanship inferior to Huggies, but still quality stuff; Often scented so baby might be allergic."
88832,1,"Great diapers. Our child has worn this brand since birth and we have not had any issues with leaks or any other problems. He's now 1 and they are still the best out there. In addition, the savings offered when using Subscribe and Save are fantastic."
161718,1,"We bought this tub after using one of the other baby tubs. Our friend had this tub and said it was terrific. I really didn't belive her. However, after using it I love it! My son is so happy when he gets his bath. He is 4 months old and can kick his feet in it without a problem. He can't sit up on his own yet so I still use the sling with a yellow teddy bear sponge to help support him from slipping. I expanded the tub and it is a great size for my tall baby. It drains really well also! I don't have any problems with leaks. You have to make sure that you latch the parts together properly so it doesn't leak. It says that in the directions! Overall I am very happy with this tub!"
79540,0,"Feel and learns are very expensive and I have yet to find out why. My son has no problem peeing in these. He does not seem to ""feel"" anything and does not have any urge to be changed. We went with a cheaper brand this time and they work exactly the same.. so what am I paying for besides the Pampers name?"
164676,0,"I used to buy pampers from Amazon through the subscribe and save program with free shipping. Amazon switched to Huggies in their subscribe save program and dumped the free shipping. The 252 count of size 1 baby dry is $42.99 at Amazon and $32.99 at Babies-R-Us. Plus Babies-R-Us gives me coupons every month for $10 off when you buy 2 boxes, or $7 off when I buy one box and a box of wipes. I still use Amazon for other things, but not for diapers!!"
181160,1,I have used this play mat with both of my kids. My son LOVED it and my daughter loves it too. I bought another play mat but we both weren't satisfied so i dug this one out of the basement. Three yrs later and it still works the same.
41644,1,"I read all the reviews and originally selected another brand monitor with all the bells &amp; whistles that was supposed to be the best one, but it was awful! There was so much feedback it would wake up the baby. My husband bought this one because he thought it was &quot;low-tech&quot; and a little more conventional. He was right! The sound is great, no problems hearing the baby in the room with the air conditioner going. We also use the receiver alone as a static maker and it puts our baby to sleep when he is in his carseat."
94609,0,We returned the Avent bottles and bought more Playtex VentAire bottles instead. Isaiah is 3 mo's old and he has used Stage 2 nipples from birth. He enjoys drinking from the Playtex VentAire much more than Avent or other brands. We believe it is because Playtex's venting allows him to suck without encountering increasing resistance and needing to break his seal for the bottle to backfill with air. The Avent do seem like they would look newer longer but looks aren't everything.
58924,1,"This product has been a life saver. No more burnt nipples &amp; bottles! I have been using this product for 9 months and it is GREAT! The only thing is that I can't find a cleaning agent for it. It says to clean with &quot;Citric Acid&quot; I can't find it anywhere. For anyone who is thinking about buying this product, BUY IT!"
42137,1,"Bought this seat when my son was 1 yr old but not heavy enough to be turned around facing front (20 lbs.). He was long and leggy so I needed something bigger than what I had (something that came with a stroller).Used the Latch and tether until he exceeded the weight limit for latch (42 lbs. according to the manual)(now using seat belt/tether as directed). Still using this seat- my son is 7 and a half. We love the harness, it protects him better! He sits higher so he can see out. The seat cover comes off and is completely washable. During the time we've had this there was a recall on the strap between the legs that tightens the shoulder straps and we received it in the mail with complete and easy to follow directions to fix.Read the manual and register your product.This is the Mercedes (*TM) of car seats! Exceeds US and European safety standards!At the time this was a bit of an extravagant purchase but well worth it!! It has lasted us this long!Everything that touches your child is removable-and washable. It's a bit complicated getting it all back together. If you aren't comfortable- take the cover off and put it in the shower and hose it off....straps and all. Soap and water the juice/food/yuck stains.Really! Bought this April 2003 and still using it (one child)! It's pristine!"
11033,1,"Exactly as the description says as well as the other reviews. Extremely happy with my purchase and will order another for my next child. The green color is good since I know other products had problems with their colors and it is exactly like the picture. Soft, light and my daughter uses it as a play seat and fits perfectly at the table. Nice and small with just the right height."
603,1,"This is the best diaper on the market for the money. Period. We need to use the Huggies overnights while he sleeps, but other than that, this is the perfect diaper. Pleasant smell, cute characters, tabs work great! Hopefully P&G doesn't mess with these like they've messed with so many of their other products lately."
160423,1,"We are very happy with this item, It has helped with potty training, and Everything came on time. My son loves Blues Clues, so this was a great surprise for him!"
98958,0,"These diapers are average at doing their job. On my baby, they're not the best fit. They're quite wide between the legs, which is a bit awkward even for my 4 month old who likes to stand, but the bulk between the legs makes it a bit difficult. Also, I prefer the elastic give on the tabs of the Pampers Swaddlers diapers; the stretch makes a better fit up around the waist. These Baby-Dry diapers seem to suffer from ""escape leakage"" up and out the back side quite frequently, and the baby gets changed a minimum of 12 times a day."
176967,0,"Great item but is hard on batteries (4 AA). An AC adapter would be a great accessory if it can be made safe for the baby. I read where someone couldn't find out how to change the batteries - for others in the same situation - remove unit from crib, place fingers under back part Grasp the back with your palm. Press hard on the center with your fingers while pulling dowmward. It is difficult but does come off allowing you to get to the battery compartment."
114469,1,"I bought this for my 11 month old. I chose this one because it can travel and also for the cover on the feeding tray! My hubby is a germafobe and the cover on the tray is just a great idea. It's easy to open and fold up. Now my child can sit closer to us when we eat out and have her own table to slap happy hands on. The only down side is no cushions, but then it wouldn't travel well. I also will use this to go to friends, perfect for holiday get togethers!"
135485,1,"I originally bought a much fancier baby monitor that quit working rather quickly. I did my research the next time around and got this one. It is very clear, no static and has a good range. I love that all three units can be plugged in and you're not having to spend a fortune on batteries. I bought this in 2009 and now- at the end of 2012- it is still going strong. I highly recommend this baby monitor!"
142892,1,I just got this gate today and I'm glad I bought it. It was so easy to put up! I have put up three other gates around the house and this is by far the easiest to install. It took me longer to get it out of the box than to install. It is very sturdy and my 18 moth old son can not pull it down. He was able to pull down the previous pressure mounted gate.I gave it four stars instead of five because it is a little bit of a pain to close. Instead of just clicking closed like most other gates you have to hold the buttons to make sure it locks. A minor inconvience. All in all it is a nice sturdy gate that is easy to install.
4311,1,"I needed something to keep keys, drinks, cell phone, etc. This does the job, without looking cheep. I saw some reviews that said theirs was navy- but mine is all black, and matches quite nicely with my Phil and Teds E3. It's velcrow is very sturdy, and I walk A LOT, and it's never even budged. Happy I bought it:)"
166969,1,"It's the perfect size. Appears much smaller than it is. Also comes in a really nice box. Is displayed nicely to give as a gift. I purchased it on sale and I'm waiting for another sale so I can purchase more, even though the regular price is still worth it."
139673,1,"We received the ladybug as a gift when our daughter was born and I absolutely love it. It's really neat and I'm sure our daughter will enjoy it well past her baby years. I know when I was a kid I loved sticking those glow in the dark stars on my ceiling, so I would have loved something like this!"
3730,1,"This diaper bag is great, has a lot of room to put all sorts of things inside it. It's big enough to put all my personal items plus the babies things. I chose this pattern so my husband could carry it without feeling like he was carrying a woman's purse."
77856,0,"I bought this chair in Italy, therefore there are no instructions that I can read. I was told that the fabric is not removeable because of safety reasons, so am wondering how others are removing it. I have tried everything and cannot get it off, making this chair a pain to use with my 1 year old.Other than the cleanliness I do love this chair. Living in Italy these chairs are a necessity because you will very rarely find a restaurant with a high chair. Also my daughter loves sitting at the table with us versus 3 feet away in her high chair."
20688,1,"I bought this when my daughter was about 5 months old because we don't have doors that can take the other kind of jumpers. We live in an apartment and I badly wanted a jumper but I just didn't see how we could get one without the doorways being okay. I did research on this and went out and bought it from Wal-Mart the next day. I put it together and the next morning when my daughter woke up I put her in it and it became an instant favorite. She loved it!! She has been an average size baby and was able to actually use this up until she was a year. We are now expecting again and I can't wait to be able to use this with our new little one. This is a great product, seems pricey but so worth the money!!"
78376,2,"Purchased this for my 23 month old daughter and do not like it because the tray is not adjustable so the food falls on my daughter's lap and inside the seat (tray doesn't sit close enough), the tray surface is way too small so stuff is easily knocked off, and the door to the storage compartment on seat back will not stay latched and keeps coming open. I do like the retractable straps, but that's about it."
40630,2,"Like other reviewers, my son also had a terrible rash after we switched from Swaddlers to Cruisers. Our pediatrician had no idea what it was and prescribed an anti-fungal ointment and a hydrocortisone lotion. After more than a week using both, the rash just continued to get worse. We bought a package of Pampers Baby Dry just to see if a different diaper helped, and the rash cleared up within two days. I didn't really believe that it was the Cruisers diapers causing the rash since the Swaddlers and Baby Dry were fine (all Pampers brand), but when we tried using the Cruisers on him again a few weeks later (we had a ton left over) the rash came back after just a day. I did a quick search online and found lots of people have this problem. If you use these diapers, watch carefully for a rash and change to a different line of diapers right away if you see it and save your baby the pain and discomfort!"
127562,0,"well,very quick shipping so that was nice!love the color,no where for my son to get fingers and toes stuck in,solid,doesnt move when hes jumping around.my only complaint is that its was getting scratches and dents all over when i was trying to put it together...frustrating.:/"
13895,0,I had recieved a set of these bottles as a baby shower gift. One thing I did like about them was that the wide bottle made shaking up the formula very easy. The problem was with the nipples. We contstantly were having problems with the nipples pushing up and into the bottle causing the whole thing to spill onto our daughter. I have spoken with a friend who also tried these bottles and she and her husband had the same problem with the nipples. I have since switched bottle brands and now use the Playtex nursers and have had no problems at all with them.
143355,0,"Not what I was looking for. My wife and I wanted something to clean our kid's straws. I saw some lady on amazon mention these as a good option so we picked up a set. I was very disappointed in the quality. I know this was not its intended use and its only a few bucks but I still wish it was a little more sturdy. Anyway, I found something else that I'm a lot happier with. If you want something for your straws get the Sippy Stuff straw brush. If you don't mind switching brushes every now and then get these. They come four in a pack."
91795,1,"My son, has ditched the high chair for this booster seat. He turns two years old this month and is able to get in and out of the booster seat himself. I think he loves his new found freedom. This is also perfect because now when we eat together, he feels part of the family as he is on the same level. I would highly recommend this item, absolutely no regrets. It was simple to assemble, is durable and easy to clean. Excellent!"
156227,0,"We got this swing as a gift. As a newborn my daughter freaked out in it, but around 5 months old started to like it. Now I can put her in it when she doesn't want to settle down for a nap and she falls asleep in it. The straps are a little tricky because they're 5 pieces that you have to clip together, unlike a car seat where there are only 3.Although it's rated to 30 pounds, height is really a limiting factor. My baby is only 6 months old and already the shoulder straps are really pulling to get them latched in, and she's only 17 pounds. I started just doing the waist belt, but have to keep a very close eye to make sure she doesn't flip out if she starts to squirm. They need to make the shoulder straps longer or else add additional holes to loop them through for a taller child."
51302,1,"My Aunt Karen sent my Snoogle as a surprise. Her daughter loved it during her pregnancy so she thought I would love it too. I have scoliosis and it really gave me a good night sleep, which I had been lacking and didn't know it.Yep - the cover is a bit scratchy but I just threw a pillow case over the head part. Hey it gives my back support I can stand a lower thread count!!"
147231,2,"Had I written this review before this past weekend I would have given this pack-n-play 5 stars. We have had one of these for a little over 2 years and were completely happy with it until now. This past weekend a small plastic piece in the folding mechanism on the bottom of the play yard failed. GRACO is unable or unwilling to sell a replacement part and they have said there is nothing they can do. The customer service rep (contacted via email) was pleasant enough and gave us a rebate form which is good for $40. I don't know if we will spend almost $200 (again) for a ""premium play yard"" that wont last."
148193,2,"This worked great for a couple months. Then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise. The gears must be slipping. My poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move, then gets scared at the loud clicking/popping noise and starts crying. Really sad."
78760,1,This product worked really well and wasn't too hard to put together even when I was traveling by myself with my daughter. The only problem was when I had to get off the plane. It was more difficult to get it together in a narrow aisle with flight attendants hurrying you. I liked how it worked and my daughter appreciated the ride but I would only use it on flights without layovers now.
7211,1,"I am very happy with this bed. I bought them for my twins, and they like them as well. They are cute and the description given by the manufacturer is very accurate. I would buy these beds again."
178952,1,"This product was one of the most useful things I bought for myself after the birth of my daughter. It was an absolute lifesaver when I just needed to run from the car into the store, church or anywhere. I could still carry a bag of groceries and unlock my car door while carrying my baby. And it was WAY less strain on my back and shoulders. Everywhere I went people were asking me about it and where I got it. Seriously, why they aren't sold everywhere is a mystery to me. It's the best."
26884,2,"I guess it'd be fine if you're only at 4 or 5 months, but beyond that, it's too narrow and provides no support."
88974,0,"I do love pampers diapers. I was a little disappointed in the baby dry vs the swaddlers. The swaddlers are definitely softer and just fit my babies better. I wish the swaddlers went up in the next size. I will say that these baby dry do work well but they are a tiny bit smaller than the swaddlers in the back. I had a hard time finishing the box b/c of them being smaller. I purchased the next size up the next time and they fit great. I am use to them now and like them. If I had a choice over these and the swaddlers, I would def pick the swaddlers for the softness."
66698,0,"We purchased this jogger, as the reviews we read were pretty good - and we wanted the option to swivel or lock the front wheel. Plus Schwinn was a long-standing, reliable U.S company. Apparently not any longer. This jogger was made in China, and it shows. The front wheel shook violently when we used it unlocked (in swivel position). While locked, it worked quite well. The front tire air nozzle is hard to access. You need just the right type of air pump or compressor. We had to borrow one from a friend. The disks you push in to adjust the handle have already gotten stuck. We were told to ship the stroller back, if we wanted to have it checked and serviced. Well, nothing a punch and hammer could not get undone...this time. Storage stinks. The tray for the ""driver"" needs a compartment with a lid. The zipper and pouch storage behind and underneath the seat are down and out of the way. You have to stop, bend and reach to access anything down low. You need to accessorize, which adds to the cost. For instance, the clips on the shoulder straps are at head height for our son. If he falls asleep and leans to one side or the other, his head rests on the clips. So, we bought shoulder pads. The bar across the top of the seat will eventually be an issue as he gets taller, so we bought the seat snuggler. Shop around."
13633,2,"I thought that this was a cute, old fashioned changing table when I purchased this product. The reason this changing table is inexpensive is becaue it is CHEAP and poorly made. Unfortunately when putting it together several of the pieces cracked and split. We had to order new pieces. When the replacement pieces came they were different from the original ones and required different hardware. The hardware was not sent with the new pieces so we had to go out and buy what we needed from a hardware store. When it was finally completed it was not very sturdy so I am going out to look for a new changing table. This was a very poor purchasing decision. I reccommend spending a little more and getting something that won't fall apart!"
26173,1,"The second I laid eyes on this stroller, I fell in love! It is a beautiful stroller. You can see and feel the excellent quality of the stroller. It is super light weight and to use the matching car seat, is as simple as 1-2-3! The stroller folds very compactly as opposed to other big strollers. The weight is what sealed the deal. It is VERY light weight! Very impressed with the stroller! The price wasn't even an issue when I realized the superb quality of the stroller!"
96404,0,"I actually ended up with a different patterned Hotsling because the one I ordered kept arriving one size too small. This was due to a problem with the packaging, not the product. I love the look of my Hotsling, but I have found it really hard to use with my six-week old. She just ends up scrunched in a little ball and I would worry that she can't breathe well except for the fact that she is screaming her head off. So far I am back to using my Baby Bjorn, but I have hopes that once she gets a little more body control I will be able to use the Hotsling more. Oh, the sateen material is also fairly slippery so you really have to make sure the sling is positioned correctly and secure over your shoulder."
156634,2,"We registered for this swing because of its price and because we hoped it would take up less space than the full-size versions. After trying to use it with our son we found it was never a good fit.As a newborn, the swing seat was in too much of an upright position causing his head to slump down.As he grew bigger the toys didn't keep his interest. Actually the toy ""arm"" was very loose and would easily swing forward and cause the toys to hit him in the face. The seat position never really seemed to be a comfortable fit for his size.Overall it seemed to be a lower quality and I wished we would have just gotten one of the larger versions. I heard so many moms recommend swings to keep a fussy baby happy. This one just didn't to the trick for our little guy."
75964,1,"I've been looking for something to keep me ""modest"" when wearing tank tops and camis and these do the trick. They are amazing. Just keep them out of the way of your dog; mine has eaten two of them!"
139844,0,"My wife and I bought this product based on the reviews we read. Our 7 month old dtr really loves this walker. Our dtr was facinated with the rocket and the star and after playing with the star for less than a day, the end point of the star came out of the foam making the end point very dangerous. We immediately took out the star and contacted graco. They stated that there was no recall of the item and all they could do is to replace the tray. I was hoping for them to do something. Anyways this is good walker but just watch out for the star."
161914,2,"I registered for this tub, because I thought it would be useful for my babies for a long time. I tried using the sling while they were a few weeks old and my babies would slide down the sling and it was cold because air can circulate behind the sling. It is very difficult to snap together every time, so I did not benefit from the fact that it can be more compact. I would highly recommend buying an infant tub that has a built in support and then buying a bigger tub later. If I could return this tub I would."
108162,1,I love this pump! I have 3 daughters who are all breast fed babies. My first one I used was horrible. I had to stretch my arms enough to pump with that one. My second one I bought the Isis from the reviews it received. It was great. I am always on the go and can not be bother to finding a place to plug in or to remember buying batteries. This is the easiest pump to squeeze . I just have to apply very little pressure for my milk to express. It is comfortable without the tugging or soreness. I kept it long enough for my third daughter to arrive and it is still going strong. I highly recommend Isis Pump to everyone. Also their storage cups are great too. They stack up and you can attach them to the pump and store them immediately.
121128,0,I purchased this seat based on the rave reviews here on Amazon. I had a 2 month old that wanted to be held ALL the time and slept for only short increments. I thought this seat sounded like a lifesaver! I was dying to receive it!I put it together as fast as possible and put my daughter in it. And nothing. It's helped not one bit.I should have gotten a bouncy seat as that would have been more useful.The music is too loud and you can't adjust the volume. I really can't say anything great about it.We have now had it 2 months and I don't believe it is more than ordinary.I hope it might work for you as it has for other reviewers~ but I am one disappointed mom!
162375,2,"I like the idea of this small kit, perfect for the diaper bag, but the case is made very cheap. Zipper comes unzipped from both directions and will not zip back up. Also, I do not like the nose syrenge, it will not suction from my baby's nose at all. I have not used the other products yet, so I cannot fairly report on those."
2160,1,"I've been buying these diapers since my 1.5 year old was born. I briefly tried Luvs and Huggies and have found that these are so much better, softer, less leakage. Plus it's a great value."
182156,1,These really do a great job of keeping the wipes warm and moist. I'm very happy with this product.
41088,1,"I've tried Huggies supreme and regular Pampers. I had problems with my son leaking while wearing Pampers at a VERY early age (0-2 months). Then my wife and I (we) switched to Huggies supreme. The held back leakage better, but still would occasionally and when a Huggies would be left on over some time (ie extended outings or though the night) they left all those absorbant crystals on my son. I think I tried Cruisers out of default because it was the only one available in his size one time. We loved them ever since. No crystals, even when the diaper is SATURATED...none! We do get the occasional leak, but not like before.If you're having trouble with your current diaper, give these a try. You and your little one will not regret it. Worst case, just switch back to your old ones. Good luck."
103716,0,These can be used to clean anything baby related but keep in mind that you will not be able to reach all areas of pump accessories just using a wipe.
13216,1,"I ordered one to see if it would work or not. It works in our 4 runner but not enuf rm in our ford ranger. We install our car seats correctly but the problem is my husband and I aren't heavy enuf, even with all of our weight in the car seat, to get our seats tight enuf--the officer even watched us. And it is even worst if there is only one of us to install the car seat! It sure is a great help to us!"
100195,1,pampers are the only diapers I will recommend. They are soft and non-irritating to my baby's skin. My baby has not experienced any rashes and is able to sleep through the night thanks to their super absorbancy!
77754,1,"I was skeptical about these wipes at first, but when I started using them when my son was potty training, I was hooked. Now, about two years later, we are still using them. I have a daycare and all the kids use them to make sure they get nice and clean when they are done on the potty. When we run out, my son cries because the toilet paper hurts his butt (we don't use the cheap stuff either). The scent is nice, and has the perfect amount of moisture to get the job done without feeling yucky.We also love Kandoo's hand soap, body wash, and shampoo. What a great way to teach kids personal hygiene!!"
156846,1,"I GOT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON, AND IT IS HIS FAVORITE TOY. HE IS NOW 5 1/2 MONTHS OLD, AND IT KEEPS HIM BUSY FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR. HIS PARENTS LOVE IT."
157088,1,"My twin girls take turns playing with this toy and loves to sit in it. We bought it at 4 months of age and they are now 10 months. They bounce quite a bit in it and enjoy chewing on the flag and frog. It is not stable enough for them to pull up on when outside of the toy, which they sometimes try to do if it is in the room and they are not in it. There is no volume control on the musical toys, but it is quiet, overall. It collapses quite easily and the toys can be taken off and/or moved around."
92291,1,"My granddaughter was 6 weeks premature and at 4 lbs , she had no problem with the soothie bottle , the pacifer she loves , the bottles are easy to clean and love that the cap snaps on the bottom of the bottle while feeding , like the little cups to hold the powder formual .Haven't had a problem with the bottles leaking . Love the ones with the designs of Winnie-the-Pooh on them , wish they came in the 3 bottle set , also wish you could buy the little snack( formula ) containers seperately not just in the large sets . Would recommend for any baby ."
130206,1,"This is a must have item. We had two swings. One, a Baby Einstein, given to us and although we were grateful, she hated it. The second one, we purchased, was this swing and it has served us every stage of my one-year olds infant life.As a newborn, my daughter didn't like swinging but would fall asleep if swinging sideways. Something about the side-to-side movement on a newborn's head was comforting to her rather than the back and forth motion of a traditional swing. The first few months she slept in this swing, sometimes overnight. You know when sometimes that is necessary because you need a decent night's sleep. The lights and white noise provided a distraction during very trying colicky times. I love the variety of settings and combinations that give the parent control. The ""reset"" button to allow for continued use without clicking any buttons is a wonderful feature.This swing grew with her over the following months. As she learned new developmental movements like sitting up and rolling over, she much preferred to practice than go to sleep. We would put her in the swing and she would go out like a light and then we would transfer her to her crib where she would get a great nap. This allowed her to learn when naptime was and encouraged her to give in to the feeling of sleep.Around 8 months she began to crawl and would scream like crazy if I had to stick her in her crib when somebody came to the door or I had to run to the restroom and didn't want to leave her unattended. The swing was the ideal place for her to go. She enjoyed swinging by this stage. It was also nice to be able to feed her a simple snack like puffs or cheerios and not have her be sitting in her high chair or the floor.Now that she's a crawler/walker, we still use the swing. She loves pulling up on it and likes the fact that it is not stable like a table. She uses it to practice her balance. She still plays with the spinning toys on the tray. And she STILL is swinging in it. She's a tiny one-year old, 18lbs. Most children this age have surpassed the weight limit. Thankfully she has not because she's going through a transitional period where she is re-figuring out her nap schedule. When all else fails, we can put her in the swing with a bottle of soy milk (we're beginning to wean) and she falls right asleep!Yes, it uses 4-D Sized batteries but you need power to run something so technologically advanced. Our batteries would last us around two weeks. Sometimes a little longer. We just bought them in large packs from Costco. Totally worth it as we used this swing daily.Thank you Fisher-Price for this wonderful, wonderful product!"
103461,1,"I love the cord shortener, the power strip cover, the simple outlet covers, and the door knob locks. I thought the other stuff was crap, but I guess it still makes for a good set to start off with."
122312,0,The food mill is easy storage and takes less space. The only thing is that the lid sometimes gets stuck and you have to prop it with a knife
10772,2,"The bottle quality isn't great for the price. Dr. Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style. So you can pump and use, just as you would with these bottles. If you use regular bottles, the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in. Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.99 to pour into other brands of bottles. I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey, when I use up all of those, I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles."
70065,0,"I am sorry to say that we found a similar problem that others here have mentioned. After about 8 months of use, the monitor crackles and you can no longer hear the baby. It happens worst of all when you are trying to adjust the volume. Obviously, if you can't hear the baby, and the monitor is nothing but crackles (I'm not talking about your run-of-the-mill static, I am talking about deafening crackling!) it's worthless. Quite a shame, because I really, really loved this monitor for the first 8 months or so. The good things were: it's small, you can stick it in your pocket, it had an INCREDIBLE range compared to the Sony I bought to replace it, and I loved the rechargeable battery. The negatives were: It did NOT have a warning when the battery was running low, so it would just stop picking up the baby sounds without my knowing. Also, even if you DID want to risk buying it, they no longer make the rechargeable battery.As I mentioned, I bought a Sony to replace it, and I can't say I like it nearly as much as I liked this one in the beginning (it's clunky and has a range of about 2 feet!) but who wants to buy a monitor that's gonna start screeching and crackling after 6-8 months of use?!?!? I"
25273,1,"I bought this stroller a month ago and since then I have been using it every day with my 4 and my 2 and a half year old boys. It's practical, easy to close, easy to open, lightweight, it fits everywhere, it went all through New York and Disney and two plane trips and it is still intact.The cup holder is no use, I took it off as it kept falling, but I don't think it's such an important item. And of course it has no basket people! It's a practical stroller which meets all the expectations for what it was made! And the price is unbeatable!I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. Plus a thumbs up to Amazon.com which sent my order 24 hours later, even though I had chosen standard shipping! 24 hours after my purchase I had the stroller at home!!!!!!"
123029,2,"The seat is fun to play with, but that is also the problem. My son was so distracted with the features and songs he NEVER sat still long enough to go to the bathroom."
148343,0,it is really small which is good and bad. it is not really comfortable for my toddler to sit on becasue her legs are way too long but it is great to carry in the car for emergencies.
97100,1,"Updated Review (After emailing the company with my woes of their product they shipped me a replacement soundbox that worked from ""day 1"" and has worked for over a year now). So, if you have any issues, contact them with your problem and they should help you fix it w/ a replacement soundbox or something like it. ***My original review is listed here ----> I received this Cloud B Giraffe as a Baby Shower Gift. When I opened the present, the sound worked. When I got it home and attempted to show my husband, the sound was no longer working. I figured old batteries and changed them, still didn't work. I really liked the idea, so I bought one of my own from Amazon.com, figuring I just got a defective product. I order a new one. Worked fine in the packaging. Same exact thing happened. Changed the batteries. Still didn't work. I even took the apparatus apart thinking there might be a loose connection. No loose connection. The thing is just really poorly made. I am so disappointed! All in all I got the sound to come on twice with the first one, and 3 times with the second one."
180456,1,Great bag. Comfortable to wear and easy to use. Lots of extra features are really useful.
130813,0,"I bought this swing b/c of its rave reviews. My daughter LOVES it. She will even just sit in it and look at the fish and the lights and ""talk""/""sing"" w/ the music even when it is not actually swinging. The swing also does a good job calming her down. It's easy to take down if you need to transport it. All that being said, it scares me. It seems to rock a little fast, so my husband and I won't use it past the first swinging setting. As it swings, the legs wobble and alternate coming off of the floor. It doesn't jump or anything, but it moves enough to draw attention to it. This swing is better than a number of others that we looked at, but I can't say that I would buy it again."
108323,2,"I recently bought a 6 pack of these nipples. I thought this would be a great product. I loved the teething nubs, the vari-flo and the non-drip design. I have used these on several different bottles, every type I own, and nothing comes out at all. My baby sucked for 30 minutes and he had not gotten anything! I tried making sure that the hole was open, etc. but no matter what, they do not work. I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased these at a Wal-Mart store, but I did not keep the package, so I cannot return them. This was a big waste of money! I used a lot of Luv N Care products with my other two children. I trusted this name and thought that I would really like these nipples. It is a great product idea, but there is a major problem with this product design. Don't waste your money."
99847,2,"Leaks at my kid's belly (especially during his sleep or nap), which is totally unacceptable.Pampers Swaddlers, Huggies, and even Costco's Kirkland Signature don't have this issue. This diaper is good for daytime only. We bought Huggies for night time or naps.Very disappointing."
48034,0,"I like the stick itself for the quality of the wood and the simple design, however the ball-and-socket assembly design did not work for us. It did not align correctly to line up flat on the wall nor for the 2 pieces (upper and lower stick) to line up just right vertically. I also didn't like the 3/4-inch or so gap between the upper and lower pieces of the stick. But since we didn't have a better option, I modified this one by cutting a piece of similar wood to fill the gap and epoxy it into one solid stick, and then attached it to the wall using a hinge-like bracket (L-bracket would work too) at the top and bottom so it would hold securely to the wall instead of moving around."
118062,1,"I LOVE this bottle warmer! What a godsend! My husband sent me to Babies R Us to buy a better insulated container for our daughter's bottles and bought this (though, admittedly, I was VERY skeptical). It works exactly the way it has been described, and I have had no problems whatsoever in getting it to reliquify or warm up again. This is great if you are a busy mom, out running errands for the day, or just going to the park or mall for a couple hours to get some exercise.I'm going to buy another as a spare and this will definitely be a gift I will give to every new mom to be."
103361,2,"I thought that the gate was very easy to install and worked great for the first 1.5 years. One evening I went to open gate and heard the ""crunch"" noise. The handle was frozen. Normally I'd take the handle apart to try to repair, but as other reviews point out, it is riveted so it cannot be opened. I was going to buy another gate so could use the same mounting hardware and latch, but with a new born, I don't want to be doing this again in another year."
112321,1,"I have 2 babies under the age of 3, and I can attest to the quality of this product. Cruisers are the only diapers worth buying, and I have both a boy and a girl. No matter what, buy Pampers Cruisers."
92423,1,"I also had a problem with this product not working... at first. I pushed the wrong button first (I selected on, then the bottle size). After unplugging and replugging it back in, selecting the bottle size first, then pushing the on button, it worked like a charm. It took 20 minutes to heat the bottle, but it was cold from the fridge and it had 11 oz of formula in it. 20 minutes almost got it TOO warm. I use standard Avent bottles.This is my first portable bottle warmer, and I LOVE IT!"
147253,1,"Hey gang. My wife purchased the original PnP when we starting baby-ifying the house. When we got it down stairs we realized pretty quickly that it was going to stick out like a sore thumb. (Tradidtional baby-stuff colors, bright blue, pink, etc.) Deciding that we didnt want our den to look like romper room (like the rest of the house) we chose this one. Its perfect, its still fun and it is just as functional as any of the other PnP's. If fact, with the soothing sounds package and the mobile, it might even be more so.Hope this helps."
119880,2,I have another basket similar to this one that I purchased from someplace else and the difference in quality is like night and day. This basket is very cheaply made and I am afraid that it will not last very long. It looks fine and fits a decent amount of clothes (I use it as a dirty clothes hamper). I am currently using it but the quality definitely only warrants 1 star.
97552,1,"I own a really nice stroller/carseat combo. The baby liked it at first but seems to get claustrophobic in the carseat.Once she got to be big enough, 8lbs, she loved using the Bjorn. If you have a snuggle loving baby, its a great investment.We enjoy walks together and its great for shopping. ""Baby wearing"" is great for baby's development and so nice for bonding.One of my most favorite baby products!My only complaint/suggestion for Bjorn is that its a little hard to manage when its not in use. Kindof like spaghetti with all the straps. The need to sell it with a nice little bag to keep it clean and tucked away when its not is use. I find myself trying to cram it in the diaper bag or under the stroller but all the straps keep popping out. Maybe I should just use a dedicated bag for it."
46071,1,"We have this hanging above the crib at baby's daycare and even though he's been there about 4 months now, it still mesmerizes him when we drop him off in the mornings. We switch pictures very occasionally, and twirl it a little as we leave and that seems to be enough. The plastic link chain is adjustable and the arch is higher than the other baby mobiles at the daycare (mostly symphony in motions, which we have at home but he gets tired of very quickly) so I love the proximity to baby's face. However, the cards are hooked to each other very poorly and the ones facing baby will not lay flat. He can still see them, but it bugs me. Also, if we aren't careful when we lean down to give him a kiss, we always end up knocking off a card or two, since they are lightly balanced on little plastic hook-things. This is a bit annoying. Still, the cards are light and will not hurt baby when they fall and the benefits of this toy far far outweigh the little annoyances."
167109,0,"I bought this car seat for our 4th baby born in June, and have used it daily since then. The base is fixed in a Nissan Quest 2004 to the secure base clips - very good fixing and easy to install so i was impressed with that 5 stars. The car seat fits in and can be removed well, a easy to used release button/lever. The let down if you like was the actual car seat. There is very little padding around the baby, and my daughter has never seemed that comfortable in it. The 5 point harness cant be tightened/loosened whilst in place - it has to be done from behind the seat which is a big nightmare!otherwise deserved 3*"
1633,2,These diapers have been a huge disappointment! They claim to be Baby Dry but they don't keep anything dry. We've only been using them for a few days and every day we've had to change outfits because of wet diapers. The diaper doesn't even seem to absorb anything. As far as night protection? There's no way it offers 12 hours of protection. Maybe one or two and that's if you're willing to change the sheets.I'm going back to Luvs.
110837,0,"I ordered this product a month or two ago, and I can't really tell if it's working because my baby doesn't like to chew on it nearly as much as I thought he would. I give it to him on the changing table when he's flopping around, and it does seem to keep his interest for a little while, but he chews on the non-bristle end as much as the bristles. In terms of actually cleaning his teeth (he's 11 months and has 7 teeth) I have no idea how effective it is. I still wipe his teeth off with a washcloth before bed, but I guess letting him chew on this toothbrush can't hurt."
62625,2,The Diaper Genie worked well for the first year of our son's life but lately (he is 16 months now) it has been really stinking. I washed it out and sprayed it with Lysol and it still stinks. I have stopped using it and am looking at other brands to use for our second baby- due in a month. The Wall Street Journal just ran a review of diaper disposal systems and they really liked the Diaper Dekor Plus.
163380,0,"This chair is great for smaller infants/toddlers. It is top heavy though once the tray is installed. One major downfall is you need to air dry the padding. The second downfall is the arms are not removable. We cannot fit this high chair under our table, therefore, my 10mo sits about 1ft away from the table. The third downfall - a huge tray that is supposedly dishwasher safe. Well, the tray doesn't fit our dishwasher. Finally, there is a huge gap between the butt saddle and the padding. I'm constantly smashed up finding foods underneath the padding."
85405,0,"I was hoping for significant hip pain relief after reading the other reviews, and while I did have some relief the first night, that unfortunately did not continue. I still use the pillow to provide a ""base"" for the mound of pillows that I'm currently using to prop myself up and to the side (sounds as strange as it looks!). I think I just needed much more cushion and support than this pillow provides on its own. It is pretty long and wide, but the stuffing isn't very thick."
141885,2,"After following the instructions to the letter, the adhesive did not hold the product in place. So it had to be replaced and thrown away. A total waste of money and time."
13131,2,"Hi-We bought the Mighty Tite belt tightener for our infant seat. We thought we were doing a good thing by adding security to the infant seat. When our son grew into a toddler seat, we unbuckled the seat belt and removed the Mighty Tite. To our surprise, it had begun to damage our seat belt, and completely defeating its purpose! We were advised by our city police to remove the Mighty Tite and NOT use it. They said a locking clip is just as effective, and not going to ruin our seatbelt. Think about your child's safety and risk before you decide to buy it."
156298,1,"I have been using sleep sacks since my baby was 3 months old. He is now 19 months old but uses 3t cloths, do the extra large was a blessing. I could not be without it. Its very soft and the baby stays covered the whole night!! Must buy, worth every penny."
31591,0,"We have been using this rack for 2 months to dry 8 glass bottles that we sterilize (by boiling) every day. The rack does a good job at holding all the bottles, caps and nipples for drying. However, the stems that hold the bottles up are getting quite bent and I'm concerned that one or more will snap soon."
104798,1,Bought this for our grandson and was really surprised how easily it went into our car. But then we took it on a plane/rental car trip and it was a hit. We loved the way it folds up and it's width makes it easy for two people to sit on either side of the seat. It's going to Norway in the fall!Happy Grandma
56545,2,Bought these knob covers about 2 months back. Easy to install and does make it difficult for my 2 year old to turn the knobs.Hinges on two of these covers have already broken with the constant opening and closing several times a day over two months. I am looking at the alternatives to replace this already.
29688,1,"This diaper bag is sturdy, roomy, and functional. I don't use the changing pad (would be better if it detatched) and instead use the disposable Huggies changing pads. My only problem is that this bag doesn't fit very well in my stroller basket (and I have a full size stroller), so I usually end up carrying it or hanging it over the stroller's handles. Otherwise, it works just fine and my husband doesn't mind carrying it around, either!"
91892,1,"This mobile is great! As soon as he could make out the beetles, my son would cheer up instantly and respond when placed underneath the mobile over his crib. The mobile was entertaining enough that I could run to go to the bathroom or to flip a load of laundry without hearing him cry during those first couple of months. The greatest thing about the mobile is that the beetles are attached to the nylon strings by magnets, so if pulled on a very safe toy detaches. This means that he can take the beetles with him and have more use for the toy beyond just a mobile. We love it!! It is very bright and colorful."
77508,2,"My baby loves, loves, loves this swing. We love it because it swings two ways. If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way.Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out... Twice! We purchased the first swing in December 06. In February the motor went out and we had to get another one. Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN!We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him. All he ever does is swing.Someone talked about this item not being sturdy. It doesn't feel sturdy but it is. It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing. We've never had any problems with it breaking down. We only have motor issues.At $159 the motor should not go out. I'd stay away from it.If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that. That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it."
92245,0,"I only rate this product with 3 stars, because my son tried them but didn't like them. The bottles are very nice. The kit is great. A friend told me about these bottles and used them when weening her son from the breast to the bottle. I was having a rough time with my son, going from breast to bottle, so I tried these. He would not take them. He loves the evenflo classic bottle and nipple. The nipples are very small and that's what he likes. Hey, you never know till you try! For those babies who love the Breastflow kit, I'm sure it's the best kit. My son and I had to use something eles that worked for us. Good luck!"
147464,1,Very well made seat....it is designed so that even the littlest baby can sit in it. My 8 week old is just learning to hit the colorful bears. It also fits perfectly within my home as it just looks better than many of the others. My only complaint is the expense.
78669,1,"This is the coolest thing ever! It's really easy to put on your carry on luggage. The only hassle, of course, is security. It's a great thing to have when I have to travel alone with the baby and just don't have enough hands to carry everything! I highly recommend it!"
117093,1,"This is the best diaper bag I've seen, I've had a carter's one that was WAY too small, then I bought a larger bag and it still wasn't good enough, the best thing about this one is the pockets, the main issue I've had with other bags was that I have to dig in and get everything out to find anything, with this one, I have the pampers and wipes in one pocket, the food pouches and spoon in another with the bibs, and my sun glassed with my cell phone in one, and in the back a change of clothes for the baby, and inside his toys and my sutff, and I use the cell phone pocket for the nad sanitizer as I have an iPhone and it won't fit. It's wonderful, and my husband LOVES carrying it, it looks masculine enough, and can be easily carried without getting int he way while juggling the baby or car seat or anything else."
83972,2,This thing would not stay suctioned to the table. Period. Took it back the very same day.
5512,0,"as in title, I bought this because of my kid likes these prints but it leaks which is not very good for a sippy cup."
135609,1,"This is a good booster seat for the price range and is nice and sturdy. It is small enough to take on the plane and use easily in the rental car. However, booster seats with the back and neck support and (especially the Britix)are by far the safest for every day use."
183321,1,"I ordered this bassinet under Amazon's free shipping. 3 days later it arrived on my doorstep:) Assembly took me a little over an hour, but considering my ample pregnant belly and inability to move well that really isn't bad. I did have to reference the instructions a few times to answer some questions, but other than that putting it together was a snap. The only part that I had trouble with was finding the buttons to put the handle to the bassinet down. I searched for quite a while because I'd expected them to be somewhere on the handle and the instructions were not clear. As it turns out they are located on the edge of the bassinet just inside the handle on both sides. They are covered by fabric that is pinned down so you can't see them, but if you run your hand along the top edge you will be able to feel them.While I have not used this product yet, I am very happy with it so far."
162674,2,"We bought this tub since we have limited space, but it was so uncomfortable for our baby that is was a waste of money. When he was under 3 months, he would slip around despite the non-slip padding. Now he is 5 months and is too big almost, and he is not a &quot;big&quot; baby (about 14 lbs). Plus there is no room for any splashing around or toys. It's also difficult to wash his backside. If you fill it up too much water leaks out the sides where it hinges. Now I just get in the regular tub with him."
17949,1,"My toddler is 33.5 in and it takes him a little bit to scooch back enough so that he's completely in, but he's figuring it out. I think if it were a little narrower (or him a little taller) it would be easier. I think the splash guard may be a little too low for when he actually does it (we are still in the initial stages)--but then again, he may not appreciate running into the guard whenever he tries to sit in it. So we'll see."
20074,1,"effective, washable baby feeding bottles. I gave this item to a friend who recently become a mother, and she really enjoyed this product. Definite recommend."
176666,1,"I knew from the beginning that I would be using these bottles. What I love is the convenience. No bottle washing, just toss out the liner and wash the nipple. It's especially nice when you're out and about or a long trip and cannot necessarily wash a bottle after use. What's nice about this starter kit is that it comes with 5 different nipples of varying flows and types (latex and silicone) that I was able to try without having to purchase separately (this is good because of my complaint below).I also like the Playtex one step storage system that you can use with these bottles (refer to my review on Playtex one step storage kits: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSCK6EN7AYRA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm). With the pump adapter that comes in the storage kits, you can pump directly into the liners.I do have a few complaints about these bottles, though:!) As I mentioned, it's nice that it came with all the different nipples because finding the best one to use with my baby was a chore and a half (refer to my reviews on the Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow latex, Playtex NaturaLatch slow flow silicone, and Playtex NaturaLatch Orthodontic Medium Flow).2) The clear liners make it difficult to see the exact amount that is in the liner if you are pumping directly into the liner, but you learn to estimate more or less. When you're breastfeeding you have no clue the exact amount the baby is getting anyways. If you're really anal, just pump into a regular bottle and transfer to drop-in liner.3) Although convenient, the disposable liners do create a lot of waste. This would be my biggest complaint.Overall, happy with product because of the convenience."
156444,1,"Our son is autistic and not fully trained at night yet. These keep the bed dry when he has an accident! They pull up like real undies which is nice, because he doesn't like anything with tabs like diapers have."
37609,2,"I have nothing but bad things to say about this product. The wipes rip easily, it doesn't clean effectively and it feels too thin and slippery.I expected a lot better from Pampers."
1823,0,"These diapers smell kinda plastic!!! But besides that the diapers function very, very well and has an incredible price. This is great since I just had triplets. Economy pack highly recommended for those with many kids!!!!!!!!!!!"
126411,1,"When my baby was a newborn, the huggies didn't work very well. He always had leaks up the back, so I used the Pampers Cruisers. Now that he's gotten a little rounder, they've been fine. Any leaks we've had have been the kind of poo blowout that no diaper could hope to contain. I've never been lucky using the Luvs with him because they don't have any stretch at the top, so they'd kind of scoot their way down and let things escape from the top."
44171,1,"The Boon Flo Water Deflector was worth what I paid for. It does the job that I needed it to do ( whoever put in our tub's faucet put it in the wrong spot and the water would go of to the sides of the tub,making a mess with every use) So, the water deflector helps with that problem. I did learn that I have to spray it with bleach cleaner after each use, otherwise mildew ends up growing..and it's really not as hard to clean as other people are saying."
119912,1,"I have owned a Cosco and Graco car seat. I finally broke down and purchased this one from all of the glowing reviews. Even after reading the top safety and parent reviews - I didn't know if it was worth the money. I just received it today and I now know why it is top rated!First - the latch system is the easiest I've ever seen. It's wonderful! It's also the tightest I've ever made a car seat. Mine always wiggled back and forth and that's with all my weight in the seat and pulling with all my might. This is the first time it never moved. YEAH! It's so easy, it won't be an issue switching this inbetween vehicles if needed. I don't dread it anymore.Second - it is easy to take off the seat cover and clean it. You can even replace it if you need to. It's also SO SOFT.Third - I love the little velcro strips on the side that keep the straps so they aren't under your little one.My child's review - well, I'd have to go wake her up..she's asleep in it.CON- No cupholder.Roundabout vs. Marathon - I debated between the two and decided that my child wouldn't want to be in the Marathon when she hits 65lbs. I'm pretty sure this seat will last until she is almost 6 and then it will be time for a booster seat. If you have tall children, you may want to consider the Marathan.You'll probably want to search the net for the best price. You might be surprised at what you can find."
147558,1,"I am an avid fan of JJ Cole products. Everything they do is top quality. I started with the Baby Bundleme. I have tried other items as well. The JJ Cole Baby Hat is soft and comfortable. You will love it. It's a perfect gift. If you want a high quality item, get this one!"
8821,1,"This is a very stable and comfortable booster seat. Our problem was that, somehow, it dissolved the finish on the wooden chair it was placed upon. Make sure you put some kind of barrier between the seat itself and a wooden finish. I suspect that there was some moisture between the seat and the chair. The damage over time was severe."
48965,1,"Overall this product is very good. I bought two sets, allowing a very large play pen, at a total cost after shipping of only 99.50$ That is a good price point compared to the competition. There has only been one major complaint I have with the product. They do not provide a door. Okay, not much of a problem really, however there are times and places that having a door would really be useful."
184337,0,"This was good until she outgrew it, which happened quickly. Like other reviewers said, it's only 24"" long so if you have a tall baby, s/he will outgrow it quickly. The support at the bottom is not removable so it won't grow with your baby or accommodate very tall babies. My only other piece of advice is to use a sleep positioner if you have a squirmer. If you look at the 4th picture over, one submitted by a consumer, you'll see the baby slipping out the side. This happens to our daughter, too, which is unsafe. I'm going to order the Snuggle Nest now."
1429,1,"They were good until my baby outgrew them and then they leaked. So, we are now moving on up to 4!"
73138,1,"This is the gift I order for everyone I know that is a first-time parent. Whoever invented it is a genius! My sister does not leave the house without this for my 2-year old nephew. It's a soft cushiony nest against hard metal seats in shopping carts and a nice way to secure him in the sometimes less than secure high chairs of restaurants. Plus, it serves as a drool catcher as well as a barrier between him and other children's drool/germs. And when they get home, it goes straight in the washer. It's nice to give a new set of parents something that they can use for more than a few months and maybe even with their next child. Definitely worth the price!"
78771,1,"We did a significant amount of research on travel options prior to purchasing this product and this one by a long shot, was the best value.I can't believe this product is not more widely known or carried in stores.We just returned from international travel. The t-strap fit snugly on our roll-on and our 18 mo. old daughter was totally comfortable (even slept!) while we strolled her through the airport. My husband and I are pretty efficient travelers, so we loved the fact that this product kills 2 birds with one stone - no extra bulky stroller needed and it allowed us to bring her convertible car seat to keep her safe throughout the entire trip. The strap is very simple to use and one of the best features was that we didn't need to take my daughter out to move down the aisle in the plane! Also, not that big of a hassle to go from door-car-security checkpoint-plane-car, as the strap just connects at 3 points to your luggage. We also received a number of comments from passers by who thought this was a great idea."
168590,1,"This is the best diaper I have used, it fits my baby perfectly she is comfortable and there are no blow-outs. I will keep buying this brand."
1946,1,Pampers are great for keeping Your baby dry and happy! Also the best price I have found.
90741,1,"I have used Pampers Baby Dry for years. They are thin, soft, and the hold a lot! I highly recommend!!"
87783,1,We bought this play mat because of the red/white/black scheme. The colors and stripes/polk-a-dots stimulate our daughter so much more than any other. We use a colorful one at our mother-in-laws and I can tell she likes this one better. We position the mirror toy to hang up above her and she starts cooing and kicking when looking at it. Great toy!
21133,1,"I live in the desert where the temperatures are extreme, which is drying to the skin. My son has dry patches on his arms, and legs, which is easily treated with baby lotion. I noticed his dry patches fad quicker with this formula than with Johnson's Original Baby Lotion. I'm not sure why that is, but maybe it's because I like the fragrance, so I'm more inclined to use it. In the morning, I can detect the smell, but only slightly. That said, the fragrance of the Bedtime Lotion is strong. It's so strong in fact that I'm not sure I would use it on a newborn. That may sound weird... but when my son was an infant, I bathed him in the morning. The Bedtime Lotion might be a bit overwhelming as an all day scent.When shopping, I was a bit disappointed when first cracking the lid of Bedtime Lotion. I couldn't whiff the calming fragrance, because Johnson's now seals their lotions. Actually, they warn buyers not to use if the seal is broken. Obviously, this precaution is good for buyers, but I see a downside to this as well. Shoppers already familiar with Johnson's Bedtime products know that they contain lavender, and chamomile, so the seal is a safeguard. The remaining sector must read the description to discover this important fact because they can't smell the product before purchasing. Many might put the lotion back on the shelf if they were able to smell it first. Johnson's doesn't specify the lavender, and chamomile in the ingredients, only in the blurb. Why is this important? Well, the ingredients have been known to cause problems in people with asthma, and allergies.In addition, I wish Johnson's would re-design their lotion bottles to duplicate their Softwash product where the lid is placed on the bottom. The lid on the Bedtime Lotion is placed at the top making it difficult to get out the remaining squeezes. Overall, I'm very pleased with this product as an evening lotion, because the fragrance fades overnight; however, I probably wouldn't use this lotion in the morning, as the scent is a bit strong."

152260,1,"Of all the bath visors we have tried, their have been several, this is by far the finest. The only complaint have is that is doesnt come in a Pelican, only a Duck and a Crab. Why not a Pelican? Surely a Pelican would be fun for young children and enjoyable for parents as well. Why, when I was a wee one I preffered Pelicans to any other birds. I think their large mouths are an example of perfection. Or maybe even a Hermit Crab? The creators of this product may have been sharp in some ways but creativity and broad mindedness was not one of them. If someone were to come across a Pelican visor or a Hermit Crab visor be sure to post back, I'd really be much more inclined to smile while bathing my child if I had a friendly Pelican or Hermit Crab staring up at me."
33041,1,"This is a great product for sore nipples. It also helped with my flattened nipples when my milk first came in and I was experiencing engorgement. The only downfall is that if you are a heavy leaker (as I am) the inserts will not absorb all the milk and will spill as soon as you bend over. I had to stop using them because of this. But the short amount of time I was able to use them allowed my nipples to heal, and I don't really need them anymore."
35062,2,"We recieved this car seat as a gift. We were initially very pleased because it is amazingly stylish for baby gear. The problems arrived when our little man did. He HATES it! The head/body support made him extremely uncomfortable- he would cry immediately upon being placed in it. We removed that. But he still cries as soon as the straps are fastened- something about them is very uncomfortable. We've tried loosening them, but there is not enough strap material to keep him safely fastened (it slips when there is too little). He's not that big a baby, but after only 3 months, we're going to have to buy a new seat! Also, the seat is enormous and difficult to carry compared with others. I don't recommend this seat at all!"
153428,0,"Boy was I hoping this would be the Magic Stroller to get me through my baby's infancy and beyond. My goal was to find that one perfect stroller and laugh all the way to the bank while all the other mommys were buying 2 or 3 strollers and I could get by with the one. I tried and I failed. Turns out there is no perfect stroller! While I love a lot of the features of the Bumbleride Flyer, it is just way too heavy to be the ideal everyday/travel stroller.Pros: Love that the handles adjust, so baby can face you or face the world. Love, love, love that! I got the Ruby color and it's just a gorgeous, deep red. I often find myself wishing they made that color in a nail polish, lipstick or car paint! It's such a stunning shade. The seat reclines to an almost 180 degree position and can be done with one hand (my baby loves sleeping in this stroller). Once closed, it can stand upright on its own (the foot rest acts as the base). Also has an adapter for a car seat (accommodates almost every brand).Cons: Wheels can get stuck sometimes when you're strolling around town. They just get a little hard to push all of a sudden when you're going over a bump or turning a corner. Also does not close with one hand and can be quite cumbersome to open. The cup holder is flimsy and merely attaches to a bolt on the side of the stroller. I already lost the first one within days of acquiring the stroller and had to buy a replacement. BIGGEST CON: Again, like I said before, this sucker is heavy! So maybe it's not as heavy as some of the others out there (i.e. the jogger types), but when you're lugging it around by yourself, you're not thinking, ""well, at least it's not the heaviest stroller around""! At 19 lbs, it's a behemoth.In reality, I live in a big, walking city where we rarely drive - so for the most part, this stroller works pretty well for us. I just avoid anywhere with lots of stairs, or public transportation as there is no way I could manage it by myself. I tried lifting it (with my baby still in it) up a couple stairs, and it was a back-breaker!Neutral: The basket is fine (is sturdy and can hold quite a few things), but probably not the best on the market. The handle adjusts to a few different positions (and is quite spongy and comfortable). But I neither love it nor hate it.So now here I am, shopping for another lightweight stroller now that my baby is 8 months old and we're planning to travel a bit more this summer.In hindsight (and hopefully advice for you), I should have bought the Bumbleride Flite and shelled out the extra dough for the matching Carrycot. That way I could have the baby facing me (in the cot) for his first few months and then transitioned to the stroller itself once my little guy got older. Live and learn."
52010,1,"This is the best carrier on the market, in my opinion. I tried to avoid buying one because of the higher cost, but I ended up buying two terrible carriers that total what I just spent on this one, and I could have saved myself a lot of trouble and money. Most carriers don't have permanent adjusting for easy re-use like this one, and my babies both hated the other carriers and have no problem with this one. Don't waste your money on cheaper versions, it's not worth it. Good for both tiny infants and older babies. LOVE IT."
38039,1,"The plus of this set is that the bumper is very plush and the height is also good on that and the minor minus is also the bumper, the corners of the bumper do not exactly fit to the corners of the crib for us to tie the threads. The quilt and the crib skirt are also good and durable."
117038,0,"i was excited about how cool this looked for myself and my boyfriend to carry around. it was a good hunk of change so we only wanted to have to get the one bag. which meant it would need to be the perfect size. its not. (bummer). so we're sending it back. it has a small pocket in the middle for keeping bottles away from other stuff which is nice but no other separators inside, just an annoying little flap that should of been a separator i think. stoller clips and plenty of small pockets for little things, toys, binkys...just not enough room for the big stuff you'll need to lug with an infant, like loads of diapers, big wipe bin, blankets, clothes and maybe a pump + bottles. no way. a toddler bag for sure. if its good to have two size bags this would be perfect for the small bag, but im not spending $50 when i still have to buy a bigger bag. it looks cool, if you have the money to spend. just not for us and our new baby with lots of stuff."
177099,1,"We bought this gate along with 2 extentions a few weeks ago, it was very easy to install and looks very nice.However our 5 year old could open the gate the first day it was installed. So I would say that it works GREAT for smaller children but not for older ones."
66637,1,"We love it. It is easy to push around. The kids seem to be comfortable (I did put a small towel under the seats so the kids can sit at a more upright position.) Easy to close and open. It takes up a lot of space in the van but it is expected. We have enjoy it very much. For the price we paid for, it is a great stroller."
106954,1,The diaper champ is much more user friendly than other diaper disposal systems. I found not having to run out to the store to get 'special' refill bags very nice. One suggestion is to purchase garbage bags with deodorant. I find for my 1 year old I change the bags once a week with no problem.
159647,1,"My daughter enjoyed this bouncer until she was 8 months old! Used every day! She could even fall asleep in it. The music is very soothing. And she liked to watch the fish and bubbles. She didn't particularly like the vibration aspect. She didn't kick the toys, but she liked to take them off and chew on them as teethers. Easy clean. She also had the cradle swing and crib aquarium, both of which are necessities."
147992,1,"We have had this bouncer for our 5 month old since before he was born, but just started using it this weekend. The colors are bright and captivating. He likes this bouncer much better than the other one he has. He squeals and laughs in delight and is excited about bouncing up and down. The toys do hang low. He is 16 lb and the toys are almost touching his lap. I have not noticed any clicking noises yet. Overall I am happy with this bouncer."
121245,1,"After much searching and trying to decide what to do for our upcoming baby girl, my husband and I absolutely fell in love when we saw this bassinet. We knew our little one just had to have it and the price was unbeatable! I couldn't wait for it to arrive! As soon as it did, my Mom and I tore into it and put it together. I asssembled it by myself, since I couldn't wait for my husband to get home, and it only took my about 30 minutes. It was very easy. It is even more beautiful in person than the picture online. I love, love, love it and I can't wait to put my baby girl in it when she arrives."
104918,1,"I will always love Dr. Bronner's soaps. Very refreshing and does exactly what it says it does. The almond is my favorite, and it lasts a very long time!"
67751,0,"This was a gift for my daughter who just had her baby. She is very pleased with it - it is easy to fold up and light enough for her to move into another room. Since she is breast feeding, she loves the convenience of being able to just reach over and pick up the baby in the middle of the night. I wish there was a co-sleeper when my daughters were born. Sometimes you just come to the party too late!!! It is a great product."
78177,1,"Amazon delivered this chair fast. It is sturdy and comfortable, simple to set up and fold. But be sure to fastenthe belts for your kid, otherwise it would be dangerous if the child stands up and leans forward. We like thedouble tray feature, easy to clean. It can last a couple of years for a child before it out-grows the size of thechair."
173492,0,I do like this swing and my son likes to swing in it BUT the swing speeds are crazy. The transition from the slowest speed to the next speed is a lot and when my son was very small it almost looked like he was going to be thrown out of the swing it was going so fast. It is comfortable for him to be in and he often falls asleep in it but too bad about the swing speeds because otherwise my rating would have been a 5.
74249,1,"With a 2 1/2 year old and a one month old, this stroller has been great as far as functionality. The snap on car seat part, I really have no complaints, its easy, sturdy, and love that it can later be used as a regular stroller seat for my little one. My 2 year old loves to sit on his little bench or stand and buckle himself in.The only things I wish were different are the storage space and the weight of the item. I was really surprised at just how heavy this thing is, I mean compared to other double strollers I'm sure it is not that bad but its definitely not easy to carry. Also, I wish that the storage space below the seat was a bit larger. With 2 children my diaper bag is a bit on the larger side and I can barely squeeze it in there on some some days.Other than that the product has been very useful and I'm really happy I ordered it. I did extensive research n double strollers when I was pregnant with my second child and I'm really happy I picked this one. Besides you cant beat the price, no way was I going to pay 500-1,000 for a double stroller."
97327,2,"I bought this pump months before my son was born because I could not afford to pay almost $300 for the Medella. I had a manual Medella pump when my daughter was born and did not want to go manual again.When I returned home from giving birth to my son, he stopped latching on well, so I pulled out my new electric pump and went to work. It was great. I could adjust the suction, and my breasts were healing from my son's poor nursing. I was even getting out 5-6oz of milk from each breast. The whole process took about 20-30 minutes.After 2 months of constant use, 4 times a day, one day last week the suction would not work. The motor was running but no suction. I took all the washable parts off again and put them back on 6 times, before it started working again. But then it also pulled some milk down the hose, luckly it did not go into the motor.Now when I use it, the suction is not as strong or as efficient. It now takes an hour or more to pump the same amount of milk I had been getting. And it still doesn't have anough suction to completly empty my breasts. When I finish pumping I have to express the remaining milk maually.I am going to call the company, I really hope they make this right."
165570,1,We were using Swaddlers at all times and tried the Baby Dry to see if there was a difference and found the Baby Dry diapers to be wonderful.The price is typically cheaper and you get more diapers than Swaddlers.Big thumbs up!
145770,1,"When I first got this for my daughter she seemed to like it. Then she learned that she could turn all the way around and get crazy jumping from side to side. The music settings are great, there's two and the faster she jumps the different sounds it makes also the longer she jumps the music changes. She seems very comfortable in it and it adjusts to three different heights. The hanging animals detach so she can play with them when she's not in it. The toy otions are varied so she doesn't get bored with them. I have had this jumper for months now and she doesn't always want to bounce in it, but when she does she has fun. So no complaints here, but I only gave it four stars because after those months she gets bored with it. It's not an every day thing, more like a once in a while kind of fun."
139515,1,"Very cute! Our 2-year old daughter loves it and uses it every night. Some of the reviews I read mentioned that the stars were not always visible, but we are able to see the stars from her bed."
64072,0,The gum on the border does not stick very well - it kept falling down initially .But overall very easy to apply .My son loves his room.
135730,1,"These 8 oz bottles are fantastic. Yes, you will still need to burp your baby, but they will burp easily and fast without any stomach aches. I originally bought the 4oz bottles, but quickly ran to the store for the 8 ounce bottles because it does not take more than 6 wks before you are feeding more than 4 ounces. Refrigerate what baby does not finish and don't worry about fixing so many bottles."
168011,1,"These worked great for our twins (1 boy, 1 girl). She was only 4 pounds 0 ounces when she was discharged from the hospital. He was close to 5 pounds. The best part was they were delivered right to the front door so we didn't even have to go out to the store."
55790,0,"I received this for my shower having picked it out and now I'm kinda sorry I did. It often overheats or underheats the bottles. You measure out the water for the warmer and when you get one perfect bottle you try the same amount of water the next time and it is no good. I use the Playtex nurser bottles and they heat quickly. I've also used other bottles including Avent which take a long time to heat and either bottle I can't get it right. I have to agree with fcwalsh, I too heat my bottles using hot tap water and a container. When the bottle is too cold you can't use the warmer again for 10 minutes and my little guy can't wait that long."
24157,2,"I purchased the Combi Savona hoping it would be my all-in-one stroller - light weight for travel, small to fit in my trunk, universal for use with any car seat, and fully reclining, so it can be used from newborn to 40lbs. The Combi is all these things. HOWEVER, the flimsy back of the stroller cannot be locked into position and the padding is attached with velcro. Even when strapped in snuggly using the 5-point harness (and several frustrating adjustment straps), my 22lb 6 month old can pull himself forward by the snack tray, pulling the cushion and the seat back forward. This causes my son to slide around in the seat. The Combi is unsafe as a stand-alone stroller. And, Combi will not return my calls for a refund (poor customer service)."
12800,2,"I finally found the heartbeat after about a month of trying, and it is EXTREMELY faint. A stethoscope would do better. For $49 at the store, I am extremely disappointed. Spend the extra money and get a doppler."
165957,1,The Pampers Baby Dry are the BEST diapers we've found. No more leaks in the middle of the night makes for one happy baby!
28672,0,"The good: looks nice, price is good, StorkCraft service is good.The bad: manufacturing defects, thin seat foam, not good for the backThe original chair arrived from Amazon with a subtle defect: one of the screw holes in the chair base had no metal insert (which provides the threading). Not having one of four screws in place is a no go. First I tried to repack the thing into the box and return to Amazon. No way. After several hours, I just couldn't figure out how to pack everything back into the damn box!So I called StorkCraft. Within about 2 minutes of the call, the rep. understood the issue (sounded like they expected this), and offered to send a replacement. The replacement chair base (it's the biggest part in the whole package) arrived in about a week. Now, I am not kidding you - that one also had EXACTLY the same problem. So I called them back, and again, they politely agreed to send another one. This time I told them to inspect the part before shipping it. The lady said she'll make a note so that the checking happens. (seems like quality assurance is a new concept for them). Third time lucky though, and then I could put it all together in 15 minutes. But we had gone 2 weeks without the chair, but luckily our baby didn't arrive too early.After about 2 weeks of use, a really bad creaking started. Upon inspection, it turned out that one of the 5 or so springs that form the seat of the chair had come off. It took a while for me to put it back in place. It seems to be fine now, but I don't trust it anymore. It's held in place just by tension - and if it could come off once, I expect it to happen again.So, the bottom line is, be ready for quality issues. And this rocker is not going to last very long."
100609,1,"Great diapers. At first glance they look flimsy and thin but these diapers are superior to all other bulky diapers. These diapers don't leak! They can absorb a great amount of liquid. Also, when the child is wearing them, it almost looks like they're not wearing a diaper at all. They're form fitting and thin."
43213,1,"i originally got a full stroller, but soon realised i needed something simple and lightweight for those times when my husband wasn't with me to carry the stroller up and down the new york subway stairs. one of my girlfriends recommended this to me because it was easy to attach the car seat on, easy to remove, and i'm able to carry it with the carseat attached while going down the stairs. the bottom storage has a good amount of space. my only issue was the cupholder becauase my coffee kept spilling over during strolls with my baby."
56857,0,"We bought the seat because it blended with our kitchen and looked great. However, in terms of function, we did not like it at all and ended up buying another high chair that had the ability to adjust to different heights, be able to recline (so that our baby could hold her own bottle which is difficult for an 8 month old sitting totally upright). Another gripe was that it did not support our 8 month old very well and the other one had side supports that helped baby sit upright.This seat is fine for the 12 month month old and up. It was a pain to clean and the seat tended to feel sticky after washing. The tray is a cinch to remove by the 18 month old too - we learned that the hard way."
103435,1,"I use this gate to block the hallway that leads to our bedrooms. I run a home daycare for babies 0-24 months and the bedrooms are my family's private space. They are off limits to daycare children. My husband is very handy and was able to put the gate up without any trouble. It took about 20 to 30 minutes and the gate's size is adjustable with four screws that hold the two pieces of the gate together. It's easy enough to open for my 5 year old to get to his room. Yet the turning mechanism is hard enough that none of the toddlers can open it. I like the loud click because I can tell if my children remembered to close the gate or not without having to go look everytime they go in or out of the hall. My husband prefers this gate to our hands- free gate that we have in the kitchen because you can open it the full width of the hall as opposed to only having a small center swinging door in the gate like hands-free gate. Since I use the gate Monday-Friday during daycare hours, I would suggest installing a clip to keep the gate against the wall when you want to keep it open. Other than that it's a great gate."
110354,1,"We installed Tot Loks on all our ""critical"" drawers and cabinets (knives, utensils, tools, etc.) and cheaper push-down style locks on other drawers and cabinets. The Tot Loks are far more secure and much easier to use, and there's little chance you'll pinch a finger like with the push-down locks.The two disadvantages to this system are the expense and the fact that you can't open anything if you lose the key (unless you have access to a powerful rare-earth magnet). The expense for the base system is justifiable; almost anything is cheaper than a trip to the emergency room with a badly cut or poisoned toddler. But Safety1st's management apparently figured out that the way to really make money on this product is to jack up the price on the one part of the system that isn't securely screwed to your cabinets. I guess they figured that if you can't open anything in your kitchen, you'll be willing to pay a hefty price for a replacement ""key"".Luckily, they've dropped the price on the replacement keys (at least it's cheaper than a key plus two locks), so I'm rating this as a 4 because it really is an excellent system."
139190,1,"Length:: 0:36 MinsWe have three boys, 4-2-0 and we've own two of the Constellation turtles. Our boys won't sleep without them. The batteries last a long time and they are very durable [insert pretending the turtle is a ball here]. Provides just enough light and has a 45 minute timer that shuts off. We travel with them and will continue to use the. We love them."
152654,1,I bought this for my son's room and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to put on the wall. I removed and repositioned several times while positioning where I wanted it without damanging the newly painted wall.I would definately recommend this product for anyone who wants an failsafe way to add a little decoration to a room.
63078,0,"Just like the other posters, I ordered new tubes for FREE from Medela. Thank goodness I read the reviews here because I was just about to order them and pay when I didn't need to. I also asked about ordering valves and membranes because I need those too, and they come with the tubes!!!"
126561,1,"After working in an infant room for 2 years, I can honestly say that these diapers hold up better than any other style or brand. I have used them now for 14 months on my little boy and they have been AMAZING!"
35409,1,Received quickly. Loved it...a gift for the birth of my first grandbaby and ALL were pleased and amused with this item! A hoot!
182970,2,"It had a horrible smell. Does not stick well , and leaves residue behind. Luckily I was able to remove the residue without ruining anything. Don't Buy"
166650,1,Love pampers baby dry! My baby had leaks and blow out with other brands but not with Baby Dry and didn't get the rash cause by the dry max.
92219,0,"Reading the glowing reviews, I wonder how long people have been using these. First let me say this is the only bottle we've ever tried, and our baby drinks all the time-- no problems. At first, the bottles work great, but after some time, they begin to fall apart. This is particularly evident if you are boiling the bottles, or dishwashing on high heat (our baby had thrush, so we had to do this). The double nipple system begins to fall apart, dissolve, large holes start appearing in the inner (blue) nipple. The two nipples and plastic bottle also begin to deform. All this leads to incessant leaking. The bottles seem to last about a month in heavy use. Designed obsolescence? Sure seems like it."
148074,1,"I can summarize this chair in one word: Godsent! I got this when my son was one month old, and I wish that I had it from the get-go. It did not take us long to realize that he did not like swinging motions, but rather being lightly vibrated while being held. He takes great naps in his chair! The only downfall is that the chair is rather shallow, so it was necessary to buy a body support pillow so that he does not flop over when he falls asleep."
10637,1,Fits all bottles (including DR. Brown's) and compartments are great for smaller items such as nipples and bottle caps. Not too big and doesn't take up too much space. Highly recommend.
151082,2,"I registered for a sling to be more discreet while breastfeeding in public. I registered for this sling because it is the only one Babies R Us carried. After 7 weeks of trying to use this I took it back. My daughter screamed hysterically every time I put her in it. I watched the instruction video three times thinking I was doing something wrong. I gave it 2 stars because it does look like you could use it with an older baby better.Even in the video it does not make breastfeeding more discreet it just makes allows you not to hold the baby (again shown with an older baby). I returned this and bought a soft carrier. Although it does not allow for breastfeeding, she absolutely loves it and it is very easy to use, with a lot less material than this. Save time and try a different sling or carrier!"
154978,1,This was an awesome purchase. Especially if you have a newborn and a toddler. It really helps the toddler feel included and helps make the transition a lot easier. This stroller helped motivate me to get out and shop knowing that I would not have to chase my toddler through the mall.
63433,2,FIRST FIVE LA warns about all walker and similar toy because there is so many babies and children that comes to the hospital ever year with broken bones an other injuries after fall out of this kinds of toys. i know that it is attention but please stay away from this types of toys the are dangerous.
36996,0,"I bought this car seat because Consumer Reports gave it a high rating for safety which of course was my 1st concern. I also bought it because it was supposed to change for the needs of your child once they got older. (yeah right!) There are a few factors that parents need to be aware of.1. First of all, the base, it's so big! It allows for little leg room for your child so either they are crossing their legs or you are dealing with their non-stop kicking of the back seat. The base needs to be removed!2. The cup holders are only good for the person sitting next to the car seat because there is no way my kid can reach it.3. The straps are not twist proof because within a short time period they became all twisted up and it's a pain to try to get them straightened out again.4. The head rest I think was more of an annoyance for my daughter more than anything else because it is placed to high up. Needless to say I had to end up taking it out because it served no purpose anyways.5. The straps are not child proof, my daughter could ease her shoulders and arms out of them leaving only her bottom half to be strapped in. No matter how many times we tightened the straps, they were still not secure around her.6. Finally, when my daughter would fall asleep, she would slump forward because the chair makes them sit up straight adding no support for her. I am constantly having to push her head back up because it can't be comfortable to sleep like that.To sum things up, if you want to make sure your kid is securley strapped in, this doesn't seem to be the chair to do the job. The chair does not live up to all it standards and frankly I was not too impressed with it. Since buying this chair I have had to buy another booster chair for my daughter. I bought the Eddie Bauer Blue Glacier Booster Car Seat and have felt much better about my purchase. My daughter is securely strapped in, and when she falls asleep, there is enough of a recline in the chair that she is not slumped forward. I would suggest buying an infant car seat and then switch to a booster seat later down the road. Many changes need to be places on the chair and if they could be met then this chair would be perfect."
161051,1,We received the product promptly. It was exactly as it looks in the pic. I thought it was of very good quality for the price. It hasn't faded or shrunk with washing which is one thing that concerned me because the colors are bright. I would recommend this product.
21920,1,"This product is absolutely fantastic. Until we got this item for our 2 1/2 year old, meals could get pretty exciting in an instant. But now, meals are much more predictable since our little angel can no longer launch his bowls across the room. The lid stays on nice and tight, and the suction base really holds firm. The rubberized handles make it easy for mom and dad to get hold of as well. I am sure that my mother wouold have killed for this bowl when I was a kid."
150207,1,"bright colors, keeps baby's attention and cools them off wonderfully!!! Weather here is in the 90's plus and my baby stays dry and cool! WOuld recommend this to anyone!"
131107,2,"This are usefull pads for the changing table, but once I washed them they were all cover with fuzz balls."
74160,2,"I got this item thinking that it was the best thing on the market. while it can be nice for short jaunts, it is not a good choice for long days at the zoo or other amusement park. the basket area is too small, we wound up having to tie things to the sides to keep them on. If the baby carrier is in the front, the child in back sits awkwardly. So we set the baby carrier on the back (somehow), but this was an unsafe way (thank goodness the cart didn't get away from us, and you can't use the canopy if the baby carrier is in the front. Additionally, I don't like that there isn't a real seat for the child in back. Again, this is a great stroller for short trips, but when your two year old gets tired...they are not going to be able to sit comfortbly in the jump seat. I am going to shelve this stroller and purchase a sit and stand deluxe. The baskets are bigger, there is the second seat option for the child in back, and I think overall...a better stroller."
102164,2,"This is a metal frame with fabric draped over it and tightened. The stitching is not perfect, it is actually pretty flawed, but it will work (unless you pull a string, then the seam splits). The sizing listed online is for the base, but these boxes are actually trapezoids that are wider at the top than bottom so if your measurement is close - beware it may not fit. There is a piece of cardboard covered in fabric in the bottom - don't get it wet! Spot treat with water and hand soap to clean other areas."
23051,2,"We thought the colors were gender neutral, we painted the ceiling blue, the walls yellow, both a shade darker than the border and all white furniture and figured we would add pink Pooh accesories if girl, blue if boy. ALAS, it took my husband 4 trys to get this border up. Following the directions didn't help, then spray adhesive and then finally roll on wall paper glue. Buy 1-2 extra rolls, you are going to need them. For the price we paid you would think it would go on easier. My husband only had 1 week vacation to get the room done and the majority of it was spent running to Home Depot and pasting on the border. If we had to choose again we would not get this border. It wasn't worth our time."
100629,1,"These fit my son really well and never leaked until he hit about 24 lbs. Around that point they started getting a bit tight and leaking at night sometimes (he sleeps 10+ hrs, so they're on him a LONG time, plus we live in the desert so he's allowed all the water he wants during the summer). We just switched him up to the size 4's, and no more issues. These are the first size of diaper that I found he grew out of before getting closer to the upper weight limit. All in all, happy with the diapers. They are lightly scented, which I generally try and avoid, but not outright perfume-smelly like some other brands of diapers we tried after he was born."
55299,0,"I ordered two of these thinking I would need one for each breast. However, two sets are included in the package, so you'll only need to order one for a double pump."
111418,1,"This is plug cover works great for us. Keeps our son out of harms way and actually looks more attractive than seeing the plug. We painted it so it would match our wall color, and to cover up the Safety 1st logo."
138034,1,When my kids were smaller and shared the same room we got them the Twilight Turtle Nightlight. When it came time to seperate them I bought the ladybug to make the transition easier so they could each have their own nightlight. I have never had any problems with either one. I have had the turtle for years now and all the parts and lights still work. I also love that it has an automatic shut off so the batteries don't die but that the timer is 45 minutes long so it stays on until they fall asleep. Very easy to use. No assembly. A must have for your kids room.
102957,0,"The pail is OK. It's nice to use regular trash bags. The twist and seal feature does not work. Sometimes the lid does not pop up unless you push the button a certain way which is frustrating in the middle of the night and my daughter is crying. I'm pretty laid back, but that really irritates me for some reason. The smell is only noticeable when opened unless there is a really poopy diaper in there. We change the bag every two days or so. Since we've heard the more expensive, fancy diaper systems are no better, we think this one works pretty well and we do not believe there can ever be such a thing as an &amp;quot;odorless&amp;quot; diaper pail. I like another reviewer's idea of wrapping diapers in a plastic shopping bag before placing them in the bin."
63031,1,"My pump had lost most of its suction and was making a funny gravely noise when I turned it up high. The woman on the phone at Medela customer service was so friendly. She walked me through some trouble shooting to see if we could fix the problem. When nothing changed, without my even asking, she told me they were sending me a brand new pump tonight! I don't even have to send the old one back. I was in shock. I had recieved it as a gift at my shower and they didn't even ask for proof of purchase. I am so thrilled with this company."
66598,2,"We purchased this stroller and it was not good. Before we finished asembling it we found that a part came broken. The same day we got it, we returned it. I am serious. I'm very picky, but this is a rip off. We were so excited to have this stroller, too good to be true. my husband and i spent months trying to decide, yet still we choose a bad one.(what i liked) Big sun shade, Rain Guard.(what i did'nt like) At the back of the sun visor big gap,so if it rains your child will be soaking wet from behind, no hand brake,tether has no adjustment, they sew it together, the bar for the legs will definetly stop blood flow in your kids legs. The material for the sun shade was really, really cheap."
113316,2,"Although my 8 month old son seemed to enjoy this pacifier we had to stop using it because he can fit the _entire_ pacifier (nipple, shield, handle and all) into his mouth which cuased him to gag and choke. I know a lot of families who love this brand, but watch your child to make sure this pacifier is an appropriate choice for you. We have switched to a brand with a larger shield."
22663,1,Folds up and packs compact with little effort. Sturdy construction. The enclosed pad works great too. Not much more I can say.
88924,2,its very bad diaper from Pampers.. It wont keep dry more than 2 hours.. during night i have to change my kids diaper 3 times.. thats being very worst thing.i bought new diaper for my kid.. i stop using this diaper.. i am totally unhappy with this pamper product.
32244,1,Got the Foley Foodmill as a gift for my daughter. We have had food mills for many years but this one is superior. The stainless product is easier to clean and easier to use than the older models. Very pleased with my purchase. Deliverytime was within a few days--another plus for this transaction.
153993,1,"Buying seven generation products is a great choise not onlt because of their quality but because of their support for the enviroment. In our age that is a very important resposibility, even if what you do is little IT STILL COUNTS !!!!"
104644,0,"There is no clear description in how the product function. I was expecting that it does other thing which this is not.What I need is actually a beeping alarm WHEN my daughter is away from me for certain feet. So I know where she is and that she is already more than the ""allowed"" range. So I can locate her right away and pay instant attention to her when she is totally out of my range.However this product function as it said CHILD LOCATOR. So basically if you are standing in the grocery store and suddenly your child dissappear, then you press this button like a car alarm to locate the child.So basically if your child is already running or disappear too far enough basically this alarm will be useless.I give 3 stars because it is as it said ""Child locator"" however I give 3 stars also because it does not give a proper description as how the device works. It is beeping loud enough that it can be even annoying if you are in a subtle environment (like restaurant) but good enough if you are in the theme park or anywhere that is noisy.If you know any device that I am looking for (automatic beeping when out of certain range). Please let me know! =)"
165132,0,"We have been using the Pampers baby dry diapers for a week now. As far as performance we are pleased. We are not experiencing any leaks and they fit our baby well. However, before I ordered them I kept wondering what was the difference between the baby dry vs. the swaddlers. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that the baby dry does not have the colored line to indicate when the diaper is wet. This feature is a huge plus when you are a new parent."
148609,1,I am pregnant with Twins and nighttime was gettting rough! This pillow is like a slice of Heaven!!! Plus it will work great as a twin nursing pillow when the babies are born! My husband works 3rd shift and when I get out of my pillow he gets in! He loves it. It is just so comfy!
40253,1,"Overall, this is a good product. The drawback I found so far is that the fastening tabs can be hard and sharp. Sometimes they can cut a mark on baby's belly."
175164,2,My daughter never played with this... ever. Although my ferrets were fasinated by it!!
31054,1,"The only drawback to this item is that the basket is small for 2 kids, however, that was in the reveiws and we expected this problem and thats why I still gave it 5 stars.Highly recomended."
110630,2,"The design of this cosleeper is ideal for anybody who wants to cosleep and is afraid of crushing the child, does not have room in the bed, or wants a system that will make it easy to ""wean"" the kid off the bed in small steps.The problem is the implementation is so cheap and shoddy, it is not worth it.The structure is rickety at best--and this without using those wobbly leg extensions other people have complained about. The cosleeper is too low for my bed as well, so I have to break my back and arms to get the kid out at night. I won't risk making the cosleeper even MORE rickety by using those cheap plastic extensions.What is with the metal bars? the metal bar on the side that you can collapse is low enough that the kid can eventually bang his head on it--and it is barely covered with the thin fabric with which you cover the entire structure to keep it together.The mattress IS very hard, as other people commented. My problem with it is not that it is so hard but that its waterproof cover is so unpleasant and squeaky even with the sheet on that my child hates being on it. Cannot blame him. I have put more than one sheet on the mattress so it does not make that nasty plastic sound or has that plastic feel.And yes, the ridiculous sheet that comes with it! It is so scratchy you could sand your house with it. But that is not the worst--it does shrink so badly when you wash it that it won't fit on the mattress--it will squish the mattress both at the head and the foot of the bed leaving gaps of over one inch at each end. THis is ridiculous and unsafe and so easy to fix.All in all, it is clear that this brand, in spite of charging a hefty amount for Ikea quality stuff (bunch of metal poles and fabric with velcro, is all you're buying) does not hesitate to save an extra cent by giving you scratcy shrinky sheets that will make the crib unsafe for your child.As I said, great idea, terrible implementation. Get something else if you find it."
148349,2,"We have the regular-sized Baby Bjorn potty but wanted another one for a second bathroom. This chair is so small, my daughter's knees are up at her shoulders, and she is a very small child. She loves this chair but can't sit in it comfortably for long."
92325,1,This is the perfect gift set. Practicality is key when I make gifts for occasions such as this. I'm sure every mother would appreciate the effort and time that you preserved as you give this gift for her. It has excellent materials in it that could indeed be used for the baby.Johnson and Johnsons are a great and well trusted brand. Mothers would be thankful if they receive this set.
171580,1,I got this tub at a baby shower and I thnk it is great. It fits in my double kitchen sink perfect. The infant sling was great to use the first week when we couldn't sit the baby in the water yet due to his cord not falling off yet. Our son seems very content when he is in it.
111053,0,It.s just what i need but need some improvements....need to be wider to cover mommy's sides and the fabric needs to be different because i had to wash it by separate because the colors stains other clothes :-( ....
137606,1,"This is a great little gift. Someone gave it to us when my son was born, and I wondered if we would use it. He is 4 now, and still likes it. We now get it as a gift for others (the ladybug or the turtle). You have to kind of prop it up on something on a dresser so it will shine towards the middle of the ceiling. And in summer when the sun sets late, you can't see much. But we still love it. I think it has LED lights inside...so when they get dim, you just replace the batteries and they are bright again."
162601,2,"I received this tub as a shower gift and absolutely hate it! First of all you can barely put any water in it. 2nd, my son is only two months old and can't stretch out his legs in it. 3rd you can barely put any water in it, my son is always freezing. The only good thing is the well in the front that I use for clean rinse water. I wouldn't recommend this tub to anyone."
143013,1,"I just received this warmer as a shower gift. I was hesitant to register for it in the beginning because of so many negative reviews. However, after trying it out, I've found that it is a pretty decent product. It's true that the wipes are warm only for a couple of seconds, but really, how long does it take to wipe a baby off? The owners manual states that the warmer is not meant to produce hot wipes. I think it is great to have something to remove the chill from the wipes, which should be comforting to the baby. When I first used it, I didn't add the water as suggested in the manual, just to see how it would work. The wipes did start to dry out after awhile but then I added the 1/2 cup of water and haven't noticed any more drying. All of the wipes are still moist. I haven't noticed any discoloration either and I am using Huggies wipes. My baby hasn't arrived yet but I wanted to try this out to see for myself how well it did or did not work. I think when he does get here in a couple of weeks, he will be thankful that I used a decently warm wipe instead of a cold one."
180323,1,"I have 2 - the black/green & green/blue (main color/inside color). The black one is made in Taiwan & I love it! The green one is made in China & a bit too hard to fit a standard water bottle in. But I'm very satisfied with the black one. Just what I needed to easily snap on my purse, diaper bag, or stroller (unlike Munchkin snappy bag). And the price is right."
113560,1,This is a great little feeding chair. My daughter sits up straight in it and I love that it is easy to clean and maintain. Plus it is portable and will be a snap to store once she is big enough. Definitely a good buy!
41373,1,I use have used pampers for both of my children. I the last time I ordered some pampers through amazon the price was 7.49. I logged on today to order 4 more packages and to my disbelief they upped the price 3.00. I will no longer be using amazon after seeing such a big price hike.
9145,2,"The 1st CD player that we received was defective and we had to return it( returning gifts is the last thing you want to do with a newborn). The 2nd CD player worked but it was such a letdown. The volume is very low, even on the highest setting. It eats batteries. You can only use it while the baby is in the crib(because the volume is so low you can't hear it unless you are in the crib or right next to it.) I would have much rather had a portable CD player... Now that my baby is crawling the Cd player is virtually useless. If I had a portable CD player, I could bring it into his &quot;playroom&quot; or the living room so that he could listen to music while playing.."
84276,1,"We got this swing for our son and he absolutely loves it! He seems to like it a lot better than the ""bucket"" type at our local park, and it looks a lot more comfortable. Every time our son goes into our back yard, he bolts straight for this swing - and now he ignores the swings when we go to the park. I assume he gives this swing 5 stars as well!"
106077,1,"We love our diaper champ, and are so glad that a friend tipped us off to it. We had the diaper genie on our registry, but someone suggested that we get this instead--because we would save on bags. You can put any small size garbage bag in it- our local Target sells a pack of 90 for 1.99. Plus, from my babysitting days, I remember DiaperGenie being a little hard to use/empty. The diaper champ is easy, just throw the diaper in and flip! If you are trying to choose between the two, I'd go for the Champ."
183821,1,i bought this for my daughter. the spill proof feature is the real deal with this item. my daughter does everything from throwing the cups to just knocking them over...and they never spill. she has no problem with drinking from them either.
118526,2,"AND it's frustrating. It doesn't puree food, it's hard to clean, hard to use, and made from crappy plastic. What a waste! My mom said she had something similar when I was a baby and so bought me this, but I will NOT be buying this for my grandkids. I hope they discontinue it."
55092,1,We have 2 young kids and were looking for a stroller that would work for a 2 1/2 year old and 6 month old. We have had this stroller for sometime now and it is wonderful and very comfortable for our kids when we go on long walks or if we go to the local amusement park. Would highly recommend.
136469,2,"The chest itself is a beautiful piece of furniture for any nursery, however, I was so disappointed when i put the chest together, none of the drawers lined up, the pre-drilled holes for assembly werent in the right spots. The whole chest is crooked now. Very disappointed."
5416,0,Beautiful item and easy to put together...the legs of the chair are not as durable as i wouldve predicted but it is a great item. i would recommend it to my friends. my 3 year old loves it and is always playing his cars on it.
94044,1,"Surprisingly, its been hard to find a two compartment dish for baby food. This one works great and comes with a nice spoon that fits on top of the dish for storage. It is a great size and lightweight for taking in the diaper bag for eating out too."
28451,1,"The glider was easy to assemble. It is very comfortable, especially with the gliding ottoman. Looks great too! My daughter loves it for rocking her new baby!"
72469,2,"Our 6 month old's hair was getting very tangled in the back. We tried this spray, but the results were the same. Instead, we tried using conditioner after shampooing her hair. That worked much better.Save your $23 and use the conditioner that you already have or try a ""baby conditioner""."
166741,1,I thought I should chime in here on the pricing issue. Amazon has now added larger Value Packs where you can get still get the same price per diaper you were getting before on these smaller packs. This is the most competitive price I can find anywhere and you can get it shipped free to your door.
156765,0,"First off all, I would like to start off saying.. That I see alot of parents on here saying that they LEAVE their child unattended in this product, and many other baby products. BABIES anything, toys, High chairs, etc.. WERE not made to WATCH your baby, they were made to PLEASE them with adult supervision at all times. The only thing SAFE for a baby is their CRIB and only when they are being put to sleep.Not to be rude, read up ladies/gentlemen!This toy has wonderful colours, but is not safe - for supervized and unattended children. There are many toys on there that could hurt your child. If you get it, make sure you watch your child in it, and be sure you watch your child in any toy, Have a great and MERRY CHRISTMAS, the safest to you."
37040,2,"I looked long and hard before I purchased a new carseat for my now 2 year old. I wanted something that would recline for long road trip naps and something that would grow with her and be the last car seat I would have to purchase. I am not happy with the recline feature. It doesn't recline far enough and her head tips over. We struggle the entire time she sleeps to keep her head propped up. The second problem I have with this carseat is the buckle system! What a joke! It takes me FOREVER to get the metal buckle assembled and latched and adjusted for whatever coat she is wearing and can be nearly impossible if she is squirmy or not wanting to get in it. It is easy enough to make bigger for heavy coats, but to adjust back down for light or no coat is impossible. Apparently this type of buckling system is what everyone is using because I am unable to find anything different in other brands. I guess I'll have to struggle through until she is big enough we don't have to use the harness and can use the car seatbelt."
115095,1,"great looking gate, functional and stylish...i have two...easy to install, much better than old fashioned wood or plastic sliding tension gates."
73423,1,"For one that doesnt keep track of time too well when not on a structured work schedule, this gadget is wonderful. I'm a first time mom and the first couple of weeks I wasn't sure how often babe was eating, sleeping, or being changed etc. This timer kept me abreast of it. The vacant button also allowed me to keep track of how often I took my meds. Now I use that button for how often I express milk. I enjoy this I've had to change the batteries once since about 7 weeks ago.I also enjoy the 5 second blue light that can be pressed in the dark during night feedings or the long standing standard light that can be pressed and times out after 5-10 minutes. This is a wonder. I would buy it for a shower gift for any first time parent."
147829,1,"We bought this car seat as part of a Peg Perego travel system. We love both the car seat and the stroller. It's nice to have a separate base for each car. We also love how it latches to the stroller, just lift the seat out of the car and into the stroller and you're ready to go. Our son did outgrow it, but then this IS an infant car seat and not meant for older babies. We now have new car seats for him, and had to buy one for each car rather than one seat and multiple bases. We highly recommend this seat."
141177,1,My 10 month old loves to play with this and is almost ready to walk with it. It is a little too quick when walking with it for her still. Very cute and fun.
92844,2,"I liked the piece of equipment,but the baby was a bit too old for it - 5 mos. I'm not sure a baby younger than that would do much with the product. Suggest they make it a bit larger, so larger babies can use. Good to develop upper body strength."
69249,1,These are the same diapers being sold at Safeway and Giant for almost twice as much! I wish I had known about the ability to by diapers online with my first child!
63356,1,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I just couldn't help myself. You're probably looking at this playmat because like me, you have a baby who fights tummy time. At 5.5 months old, my little guy was strong and standing with little assistance, but absolutely hated being on his tummy for more than a minute or two. So I figured this mat was worth a try.He was instantly intrigued. As it turned out, he was less interested in the floating fishies, and more interested in the sun decal on the side of the mat. Okay, whatever floats your boat (haha).That day he actually turned himself over onto his belly to get to the mat. Wow. Must just be a coincidence. And then he stayed there on his belly, sucking on the sun (yeah, I really should have washed that first) for a long time.Imagine our surprise when that night we looked at the video monitor and saw our baby - who we had put down on his back - sleeping on his belly. And he stayed that way. For a record amount of time. He went from waking up every few hours to sleeping around 10 hours.It might be a wonderful coincidence, or it might not. Either way, I think it is the best 11 bucks I've spent in a long time."
82013,1,"Arrived fine, products in boxes as described. A couple boxes had some substance on outside (maybe baby soap/shampoo?). Inside product fine though."
137579,0,"This was ordered as a Christmas gift, so I don't know yet how it works.I'm hoping my granddaughter will like it."
130767,1,My baby was 8 weeks old before she started enjoying this. It was too big for her before hand
135577,1,"I have a three year old and an eight month old. Going to the playground and other public places can be quiet a challenge. Luckily with Giggle Bug things are a bit more controllable. No more panicking when my three year old is out of sight. I just hit Giggle bug and know exactly where he is, which makes me more relaxed and consequently my kids have more fun playing. When we are at home, we even use Giggle Bug to play hide and seek. My son's favorite!"
97672,1,"[***UPDATE: 11 months later, I still stand by my review. This has been a great potty chair for my son. He's just under 40 inches tall and still fits well on the seat. My only wish is that the container part could stand to be a little deeper (you know... to give #2 a little more ""distance""). We are still using the seat on the potty and not yet on the toilet, so I don't really have any new thoughts on that yet.]My son is 26 months old, and a few weeks ago he had used a potty chair for the very first time. His first chair he tried was the Safety 1st Comfy Cushy potty chair, which did not work out well for him because the seat was not long enough to accomodate a taller-than-average toddler boy who is to be pee-trained sitting down (initially). If he was far enough back on the old potty chair to pee and keep from bumping his[...]on the splash guard (which was soft, but still), there was no way he would be able to go #2 also!The seat on the Primo 4-in-1 is a little bit narrower than the Comfy Cushy (which is no problem here), but it is definitely longer, and my son fits onto the seat quite well so that his [...]not bumping against the splash guard, yet his bum is on the seat so that he can go #2. The splash guard on the Primo is not very tall, but the way my son sits on it, this has not been a problem. He has been able to back up and sit on this potty chair by himself without problems, which is not a big deal right now, but of course it will be key when he is able to take himself to the potty.The top part of the seat is made of a soft silicone which appears to be comfortable for my son, and so far cleans up well. I wasn't sure how I would like that the silicone is a separate piece from the bottom part of the seat (concerns about waste seeping underneath, grooves to have to clean between, etc.), but because the piece does come apart from the bottom half, cleanup is not a problem. There are little tabs on the silicone part that fit into the sides of the bottom, but it really hasn't been cumbersome to deal with (yet - we are in the early stages of potty training).Though it is no-frills in appearance, I let my son plaster Disney Pixar's Cars stickers all over it to *up* its ""cool factor"", and he loved that! As far as using the seat part as an adapter for the regular toilet, I do feel like the pads underneath don't have enough non-skid for me, but since it does fit our toilet well, if we do decide to use it, surely I can find something to replace those pads with that is more non-skid than what is currently on there.Though we have only had this chair for less than a week, I foresee it really serving its purpose as a potty chair and being worth every penny, even if we don't use the toilet seat adapter later."
175129,1,This is a fun and safe tub! My daughter loves it and gets excited when the duck quacks! It makes bath time enjoyable. She is 7 months old and I will use it as long as possible! What a great investment!
175038,1,"this tub is super! first of all, i didn't buy this--my friend used it with her two kids and then passed it down to me to use with my little one! we've been using it with her since she was about 10 months old and she is now 26 months and we're still using it! she's not tall for her age but not short either; just average size.we continue to use it because she loves it and it uses MUCH LESS water/time/energy than filling the whole tub. so we fill it, soap her up, drain the water, and refill to rinse her all off.fyi: it's true the head part is huge. also true that the tail part is too big to pull it right under the tap to fill on its own. i just use our bath water pitcher to fill it in no time at all. we have a shelf up high in our shower where the tub lays on its side for storage.i give it 5 stars since it finally got a small tear in the bottom last month, after 5+ years of use! we duck-taped the tear and the tub still works!!"
148105,2,This product looks difffent than in the picture. It has a missing hole for screw and a part is wrong ensambled.It looks cheap.
105926,2,"I can't imagine that I am using this product incorrectly, but just last night I walked down the hall and really noticed the nursery smells like a dirty diaper. I had noticed it before, but never really thought that the Diaper Champ was claimed to be ""odor-free."" Sorry, but I don't buy it. Maybe little baby diapers and areas associated with them will just inherently smell like pooh, but if it claims to contain odors, it falls short. I don't know if we will bother to try another model/brand, but for the time being, I am buying a scent-masking spray/device to help tone the scent down. I love the little guy, but wow he can put out a scent."
51871,1,I am very pleased with this stroller. It was easy to assemble and so far we have not had any problems with it. We were also happy to receive it so quickly. We had it within a matter of a few days.
168321,1,"As with the other sized Swaddlers we have used so far, the Size 1-2 fit better than any other diaper on our baby. The size difference between these and size 1 are very slight, yet this package is a better deal. Haven't had any problems with leaking even when our son drenches them."
153554,2,"This lampshade appeared to be hand made when I bought it- no big deal. It arrived in a timely matter and had been shipped carefully. The adhesive that was used to fashion the shade; however, isn't heat resistant. It's a lamp shade, so I expect it to be able to manage whatever heat is given off by a regular light bulb. The fabric at the top of the shade has slid off, and after about 15 uses, my lampshade is worthless.Do not buy this shade!"
40549,2,"We have found this to be a dangerous product! We have been buying cruisers for a while and then about a month and a half ago, we purchased two large economy packs of the number 5 Cruisers and had horrible problems with exploding diapers. The elastic strip along the leg tears away from the diaper and all the silica material falls out of the diaper. This should not be happening! We change our baby frequently and he is only 24 lbs and the diapers go up to 35 lbs. One time, we came in to his room and the silica was all over his crib and he was putting it in his mouth! And it's not a volume problem because it happens during the day when there is not all that much pee in the diaper. We figured we got a bad batch. When we bought a smaller package from CVS, we did not have this problem, but when we went back to buying the economy size at Target, the silica leaking started to happen again. It is also impossible to get those little sticky things of silica off his bottom and legs and they irritate his skin, so we've had to dunk him in the tub sometimes twice a day to get it off. If he touches it and then rubs his eyes (before we realize that there has been another leak), it irritates them.I called customer service at Pampers and it was a joke. I told the service person what had happened and how upset I was, and he said that there was no way he could guarantee me a call back. What? I told him that was totally unacceptable and that this was a defective product. Again, he said he'd make a note of it but that they get so many calls that I very well may not get a call back. He was right. I didn't. I have since spoken with mothers in my same area (Chicago) who have had similar problems and thought they were the only ones. They, too, called Pampers customer service line and were totally ignored. One, like me, had found her little girl with a mouth full of the silica that had come out of the diaper while she was playing. I am now sending a letter to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. If you have had similar problems with the elastic seam separating from the diaper so that the silica comes out the side, *please* call Pampers and complain. If they do nothing, contact the product safety commission or e-mail your local product safety TV news reporter to do a story on this. Pampers is totally unresponsive to a very real problem. How many kids have to ingest silica before they address this problem?"
96400,2,"Very disappointed with this sling! I purchased this product with the expectation of being able to carry my newborn close to me, while having the freedom to be hands-free. Although I purchased the appropriate size, the product was way too large for my son who is now 1 month old (I tried the sling on my baby at 2 weeks and 3 weeks old as well)! After watching the video and following the picture instructions for the one shoulder newborn position, the sling just did not support my baby's head at all. AND, the positioning of the sling on my body, even after several attempts to shift the sling to a comfortable location, never worked. In the end, my baby's body in the sling was always crooked and contorted, which caused discomfort and led to crying. In addition, the depth measurement of the sling caused the side panels to fold in at the top making it so that I could barely see my baby in the sling. I would definitely not recommend this product for individuals that have newborns or smaller-sized infants/toddlers. The Hot Slings company should consider making some adjustments to the sling desing. For me, the product was not worth it's expensive price tag!"
121987,0,"the stroller is a little big and heavy since it is built for twin but if you don't mind that, it can be a good stroller. i like the many ways that we can arrange the seats, big and sturdy wheels, strong frame.. However, we wish the manufacturer include the 2nd car seat attachment to the package. I think most of the people who are buying this product have twin babies, it does not make sense to include only one car seat attachment. Plus, there is no way we can buy this car seat out there in the store. No body has the car seat attachment in stock.."
42012,0,"Since we are using a regular dresser as our changing table, we didn't want our PL wipes warmer sitting directly on the wood, plus we needed storage for creams, lotions etc. The side units do hold our shampoo, lotion, oil, and powder (full sizes, Burt's Bees brand) and were bigger than I expected which was a pleasant surprise. However, my PL wipes warmer was EXTREMELY difficult to affix to the top of this diaper depot; I had to put the depot on the floor and use my body weight to get the wipes warmer to snap on top. I'm concerned about removing the warmer to clean it for fear that I won't be able to get the dang thing back on. Lastly, from the picture and description I expected it to accommodate at least a few cloth diapers. We use BumGenius 4.0 and there is simply no way I could fit one diaper, let alone a day's worth, in the cubbies. The picture must be displaying premie sized diapers because I can't imagine 20 fitting in there! We have to store our dipes elsewhere and just use the cubbies to hold a few extra liners. Also, the depot arrived scratched and with a crack down the side of it. Definitely my most disappointing purchase from Amazon.Bottom line: wasn't worth the hassle of a return, but I wouldn't get it again. doesn't fit my PL warmer very well and is useless for storing cloth dipes."
40620,1,"Pampers have the best fit, capacity and leak protection. Our daughter (mostly) wears them at night because we choose to wear more economical brands during the day to save money (Target brand is half the price, even with the Amazon's Subcribe and Save). However, if I had unlimited funds, I would prefer having her in Pampers 24/7 (we've tried Luv's, Kirkland, Huggies, 7th Generation and White Cloud/Walmart Brand). They get 4 out of 5 because they are not the most environmentally friendly disposable and are expensive."
164047,1,"We've had no problems with this unit. It works well and has good range. The only complaints would be that 1.) it only has two-channels and one channel picks up our neighbor's monitor, so we're down to one channel, and 2.) You can't have the monitor on in the same room as the base unit because it gives REALLY loud feedback."
74785,1,My wife and I bought one for our daughter and it was the best swaddling blanket in terms of keeping her swaddled and comfortable for sleeping. We just bought one for my cousin who is expecting a little girl.
135171,1,"I recently purchased the maroon version of this stroller in January for a trip with my 2.5 year and 4 month old kids. I did a lot of researching double stroller and/or alternatives to single strollers (i.e. kiddy boards) as well as writing to the company to ask some questions. Since I live in Alaska and need to fly out to visit family - I wanted something that I could travel with and use as jogging/outdoor stroller. Here are some things you might like to know:PROS:* It really does fit through a standard doorway - we were all amazed!* My kids love to ride in it and sleep! The reclining seats are faboulous!!! I put a head support in the seat for the baby and she did great!* The rain canopy that comes with it works well but doesn't fold very well on the top - you just have to pile it up or take off completely once it stops raining.* The stroller responded very well with a full load and gear. It also was well balanced with just one kid in the stroller - no tipping or pulling to one side.* The wheels come off very easily.* The simple folding mechanism is great.* Overall I'm impressed with the workmanship and the company. They responded very quickly to all my questions.Cons:* Even though it doesn't have a drink/parent tray - the pockets can hold water bottles, etc... and I just hung a bag on back handle.* The top canopy is short towards the rear....Since my two year old is little this wasn't a big issue...but could be if you have a tall kid.* It does take up room - we have a Subaru Outback and it can fit in back with wheels on/folded - but it's tight. Works better to have wheels off.Final thoughts:I recommend you purchase the stroller bag (from other sites) for traveling with the stroller - keeps the stroller together and has great strapes for hauling the stroller. Plus you can stuff other gear into the bag and still be under the 50 pound rule at the airport :)We got a lot of use out of this stroller in a short period. Because it doesn't have lots of plastic parts - we've been able to use it in the cold and on snow plowed streets as well. I look forward to getting several years of use out of it and selling my single jogging stroller."
5369,1,I had been looking for these sippy cup replacements for a while and I had been unable to find them in any of my local stores. Of course when I checked Amazon they had them and I was totally relieved that I didn't have to buy a whole new set of sippy cups!
38877,1,"This was so easy to keep my baby comfortable and secure in the bathtub. I love this thing and am still using it to wash my sixth month hair. Even though we have graduated to sitting up in the tub, laying him on this to wash his hair frees up my hands and keeps the water out of his eyes."
159168,2,"I registered for this item and was so excited to get it. Within a month of use, the toy bar started rattling very loudly- so much that we couldn't stand turn it on. Fisher price had horrible customer service- I had to end up spending money to get it fixed (even though we had owned it only a month) so when they sent me a new one I just returned it and bought the flutterby bouncy seat- I am EXTREMELY happy with that one!"
3639,1,My daughter outgrew her initial car seat very quickly. I needed something that would support a baby (rear facing seat) but could also be used by a toddler (forward facing seat) when the time came. This seat met my needs. It was easy to install and I loved the fact that it could transition from a rear facing seat to a forward facing seat.
45960,1,Our newborn loves this mobile and will sit and stare at it for a very long time!! It's interchangable so he doesn't get bored too!
82947,1,"I love this product, it saves me so much time. I keep a bowl of hot soapy water next to my sink and when I finish using a bottle I disassemble it and put it in the bowl. At the end of the day I rinse off all of the parts, put them in the sterilizer and zap them in the microwave! I also throw the pacifiers in as well. I would recommend this to anyone using Dr. Browns bottles who knows how long it takes to wash all of the little parts!"
52061,1,"I have given this gifl to 3 new parent couples, and everyone loves it! The dads really like being able to care for the babies, and after giving the navy blue one to my daughter, we learned that the gray one is better, because it does not show ""spit ups"", and is a lot cooler for Dad's to wear. Also, the size adjusts for men and women, so it works for both parents. My son in law grouted his shower ""wearing"" his daughter, no problem!"
142319,1,"I got this carrier after taking back the Eddie Bauer brand. So much nicer quality! I use it all the time! Very easy to take on and off and to get a squirmy baby into and out of! This was perfect for flying with my 3-month-old. I just strapped him in, he fell asleep, and I had my hands free on the plane! I also use it when at the mall, the grocery store, or out walking the dog. The back support is great too. Washes up well. Love it!"
15279,1,"I was just about to order 2 of these valances from Kmart.com for $19.99 each (same price on Overstock.com) when I decided to type the name into a search engine. I was so surprised and happy to find that Amazon.com was offering the same valances for half the price! Needless to say, I ordered the 2 I needed, they arrived quickly, and I am very happy with my purchase. Amazon.com comes through again!"
156734,1,"My 7-month old daughter loves her ExerSaucer. She loves to jump up and down in it, look at herself in the mirror, and chew on the accessories since she's teething. She can spend a fair amount of time in it, which gives me time to do other things that I'd like to get done."
70664,1,"I bought this rocker because my daughter loved to rock her self in her carrier. But as she got bigger (she is now 9 months), I had to start leaving the carrier in the car because it had gotten two heavy for me to carry. This chair is great! She continues to rock her self in it and I put it stationary when its time for her bottle. I never put the batteries in it for the vibration because shes calm and relaxed just being in the chair alone. Also, just wanted to comment about a previously written review about sitting up in this chair. My daughter often sits forward in this chair (strapped in of course) and because of the (what I'll call) stoppers on each side, it prevents her from falling forward. Of course, always us caution because you never know! I would definitely recommend it."
104226,1,"It does its job.Some installation tips to make the process easier:This is easier if an extra person is available to hold up the other end of the plastic, otherwise it tends to fall down, making it hard to mark/puch holes. I managed to do it myself:- I first stapled one end to the door frame/wall. A regular stapler worked but if your wood is harder you may need a staple gun (or just a nail with a large head would likely do).- To keep the plastic propped up I used packing tape and taped the top part to the railing.- I had to make holes further from the edge than the hole puncher could reach. A drill with a 1/8"" bit was very easy (just be careful that the drill bit does not glide along the plastic surface and scratch it). Also make sure to drill from the side of the plastic that faces the child (so the sharp edges around the hole are on the opposite side)."
97964,2,"I originally had planned to breastfeed my son, so i hadn't given too much thought into buying bottles. However, in my eighth month of pregnancy, I developed a blood clot. My ob told me that I would no longer be able to breastfeed because I would have to be on blood thinners for the next six months and that breastmilk wouldn't be safe for my son. I called my pediatrician and he reccommended the Ventaire bottles because they reduce gas and colic and "" are the best bottles out there"" So, I bought the bottles and the stage 1 nipples and prepared them exactly the way the instructions said to. I boiled the nipples and the bottom vents, then I checked to make sure the nipples were opened and had to boil about half of them for a second time, but that was no biggie. I dried them and put them away to await my son's arrival. The night my son came home from the hospital, I get a bottle out to feed him....he couldn't get anything out of the nipple. For the life of me, I couldn't feed him with the bottles. I tried taking a needle to make the holes bigger, but that didn't help. I ended up having to take the bottom off the bottles just so my son could eat! The next day, I prepared the stage 2 nipples and thought that I would try that. He couldn't get anything out of that one either! He sucked and sucked and just got mad because he couldn't eat! I even tried to poke the holes of the vents out, but nothing helped. I even thought that I was tightening the bottoms on too tight but loosening them didn't help. I had to go buy new bottles for him because nothing I did got them to work. The sad part is, the bottles that work the best for him are the cheapest ones that I could find because I wasn't going to spend the money on another bottle that wouldn't work for him! I hate these bottles and I wouldn't reccommend them to anyone!"
51304,1,"I am a first time expectant Mom and had NO idea - NO IDEA WHATSOEVER - what I signed up for with pregnancy. I was shocked at how uncomfortable sleeping was getting. I would wake up exhausted and my lower back and joints would just ache. So I went ahead and spent the extra money on this pillow. I am SO glad I did, too. It has helped tremendously.My Mom teased me about the pillow and how it looked but she just spent the weekend with me and I caught her cat napping with the pillow and even she admitted that it DOES help you to relax.The only problem I have is turning over. But as many times as I get up in the middle of the night for reasons OTHER than sleep, that is so manageable!"
25285,2,Broke/ripped in 3 days! Little legs can rip it no problem. Waste of money. Do not buy!
148663,0,"Now that I'm close to the end of my pregnancy, thought I'd share my experience with this pillow, as someone with the following non-pregnancy sleep patterns:-Back sleeper-Like low/soft head pillows (memory foam neck pillow)-Don't like having arm restrictions-Generally get hot when I sleepIn summary, I bought this pillow to force me, the back sleeper, to sleep on my side. I give it a 3 star for use as designed, but 4 stars when used upside down. It's better than just using separate pillows because the legs are held in place enough to make adjustments easily in the middle of the night (i.e. you don't have to worry about losing your pillows or having the slip too far away). But you do need to find a way to use it that works for you.PROBLEMS:Overall, I didn't like this pillow when used the way shown, and I gave up on it until the 3rd trimester for the following reasons:-Too movement restrictive/arms fall asleep - if you use this the way it's shown, you need to wrap one arm below the pillow to hug it. This was tough for me because I felt too constrained when I slept, and my arms fell asleep sometimes.-Head pillow too high - made my neck sore; needed my own pillow...-Hot! - you are basically surrounded by a big layer of insulation, so this pillow is really hot, particularly with arms wrapped around it.-Bulky - this takes up about half of our king sized bed, so expect complaining husbands if your bed is smaller.(-The tight seam? - as other reviewers complained, the seam on the U is tight. But I found that you can deal with the seam by making sure both legs of the pillow are as close to your body as possible. Didn't find it to dig into my shoulder that much if the legs are not spread out)HOW I MADE IT WORK: Flip it upside-down (bottom of the U at your feet)Flipping it helped me achieve my purpose of staying on my side/getting leg and back support while not being overly restrictive. I would recommend it for back sleepers if used in this configuration.To stay on your side, put the ends of the legs at around chest/belly level (the flaps at the end do help with support). Hug your knees or legs around one of the pillow legs to keep an angle on your belly, but keep the pillow leg on your back side flush against your back so that you can lay against it on your ""back"". (Found this to be important because if the legs are spread too far apart, you will still end up too much on your back.)If you need to get up in the middle of the night, just lift the top of the outer leg over you and slip out underneath it.It's still a hot pillow, but since a good portion of your upper body is not inside, it isn't nearly as bad as when it's fully around. I basically just used a sheet to cover myself all summer, or nothing at all on really hot days. Bulk can't really be avoided, but alas, who's a husband to argue with a pregnant lady?;)"
175683,1,"I am very pleased that Halo now has a swaddle sleepsack sized small. I am using it for my third child and it has met all of my needs for swaddling a 3-6 month size child. The quality is great, everything I have come to expect from Halo. The swaddle aspect is easy to use. I've been able to ""semi-swaddle"" with my daughter's hands tucked near her face still having her arms secured which is great as we transition to a regular sleepsack. Overall this is one of my best baby purchases."
73973,1,I wanted a double stroller that I could still use an infant carrier with and this is the perfect stroller for that! It has an universal car seat adaption which is awesome and my toddler son loves riding on the back. It is metal so that makes it durable and the back seat slides so it's easier to put things in the bin underneath. The canopy moves in any direction I want which is nice in AZ because the sun is everywhere! :) I just love it and am happy with my purchase.
56919,2,"I dislike this gate. hard to install and to adjust - not really a pressure gate - needs to be screwed into the wall, noisy.Get the Regalo easy close instead."
34334,1,"I use this to reduce heat rash on my (adult) skin. A little goes a long way and if you like the smell of rosemary, you'll like this a lot!"
156067,2,"it is too big and too heavy for my 6-month-old baby to hold, and also the materials seem too hard for my baby to chew. My baby himself is not interested in it. a bad buy."
157077,0,"I purchased this toy approximately 2 weeks ago and my son loves it, as he is currently 6 months old and loves to put things in his mouth. The downfall however, was when he grabbed hold of the rattle attachment (with the fin looking things on top) and stuffed it in his mouth. He managed to stuff it so far back into his mouth that he choked and vomitted all over the saucer. Luckily both parent were in the room with him to remove it from his mouth. I think the toy offers lots of activy, but he mobile attachments may need to be re-thought.Solution: We removed the attachment from the table top to prevent further choking hazards."
36764,0,"I have twins and already owned theBoppy Classic Nursing Pillow with Soft Boa Slipcover, Teddy Bearswhich I use for propping the babies after feeding. I bought this boppy so I could put both babies down after feeding in a propped position.Out of the bag, I noticed that this boppy was firmer and thicker than the old one. Due to this, the babies would slide down the middle of the boppy and wouldn't stay propped on their back. This was dangerous because they would end up with their faces tucked in the side of the boppy. Also when I used it for tummy time, the increased height meant that when the babies kicked/pushed forward, they would tip over headfirst and could hurt themselves.This pillow may work for older babies who can sit unsupported, but it's not the best purchase I've made for my 3 month old twins."
76675,0,"I actually didn't use this set as often as I thought I would. My diaper bag came with pockets and a wipes case, so the main things i i used were the pacifier holder and the black zippered envelope for extra clothes. The items are of good quality though."
166474,1,Yes I prefer the dry diapers in the pampers brand. The swaddled and cruiser is a little thich for my baby.
32745,1,"Both myself and my husband find this carrier very comfortable and obviously so does our baby as she falls asleep every time we use it. Very easy to put on and off, after a couple of practice runs. Tip - only undo one side, to put baby in and out. Leave half assembled for next time and then just slip into easily. Don't forget the sun hat."
160152,1,"Cotton swaddlers DO NOT WORK! Except for the pricey miracle blanket. If you dont want to spend the $$ you have to get micro-fleece so the velcro stays attached. I only gave it a four, bc of course it gets warm and you cant really use it in the summer months."
81921,1,"Nice colors, good quality, does not fade after washing, animals look great. We converted the valance into a small pillow cover.The only problem for a 4 star review is that the comforter is stiff because of all the animals.... which means it is not soft for the baby to roll in it, or lie on it etc.. so not preferred by my daughter. We are actually using a cheaper walmart set comforter which is much simpler printed and softer. This is a standard nice looks vs. practicality issues we faced."
74941,1,This gate was a lifesaver for us for several months. We used it to block our son from going up the stairs. It was very secure and we were able to step over it pretty easily. I would definitely reccommend it.
143327,1,"I purchased these to clean some glass straws I purchased and they do a great job; however, they work equally well on my Dr. Brown's baby bottles that also have lots of small parts. I can think of lots of odd jobs that would make these cleaning brushes useful. For the price, it doesn't hurt to keep a few of these with your cleaning supplies."
153994,1,"Free of chlorine and other junk, they work well and don't smell like so many others. Thumbs up."
95047,1,"I'm a full-time mom, so I only needed a pump for occasional use, to build up a little stock in the freezer or for the odd day when I was going to be away from the baby. This pump is perfect for that. It's plenty powerful - the variable suction strength more than exceeds what I need to pump as efficiently as possible. I usually use it plugged into an outlet, but I've had to run it on the batteries probably a dozen times so far and I'm still on the original set of batteries. It's compact and comes with a carry bag so everything stays together in my day bag when I'm out of the house.Some other reviewers had problems with the flange - I haven't had any issues so far, but Medela includes an extra two or three flanges with the pump, so it's an easy fix if something happens. And yes, condensation builds up in the tubing during a pumping session, but I've never had the condensation reach even halfway down the tube toward the motor. And the instruction book clearly says that if you run the pump (detached from the bottle) for a few minutes after you're done pumping, the condensation clears out. Works like a charm!"
40601,1,"I love this diapers, baby is very comfortable in it. And I love amazon free super saving shipping (they promise to delivet in 5-10 days, but it takes only 2-3 days!!!), the last package I got next day after ordering!!! Thanks amazon.com for great service!"
163720,1,"This is a great high chair. I bought it because we have a small kitchen and don't have a lot of room for a high chair, it is inexpensive (compared to other high chairs) and I also love that it converts to a booster chair for when my daughter is older. We even bought one for my mom's house for when my daughter is visiting Grandma. The tray is easy to wipe down, and for very messy meals I can throw it in the dishwasher. I have no complaints about this hair chair at all."
144838,1,"I purchased a baby mattress for my grandson, it was delivered promptly. The mattress is excellent, the customer service was exceptional! I would highly recommend this mattress and Colgate products."
129773,1,I bought two of these little beds for my daughters and they love them. They were easy to assemble and are as cute as can be. The crib mattresses fit perfectly in them and are nice and tight so there is no room for little fingers and toes to get pinched between frame and mattress. The instructions are clear and simple if a little bit sparing in detail.
137913,1,Gave these to my grandbabies last christmas. They love them. I was the biggest hit for the season.
117962,0,"I've been using the Graco Mosaic stroller for 2 years now. We used it for about 5 months with the Snugride infant carrier and just by itself ever since. It definitely has it's pros and cons. I am not sure I would buy it again.PROS- Lightweight and slick looking- Works with all Graco Snugride and Safeseat infant carriers- Very easy to fold up w/one arm and toss in the trunkCONS- No food tray or cup holder for the baby- Cheaply made - mine is falling apart- Cheesy plastic wheels - the stroller jerks every time you roll over a stone- One of the snap covers came off mine when he was around 8 months old, revealing this sharp spikey metal thing underneath. I was mortified!! He could have swallowed the snap cover and then cut up his arm. Graco customer service was very good and sent me a whole new body assembly, but I was still really upset about it and I almost just threw the whole thing in the trash that day.- You can't push it with 1 arm, since it's umbrella style with the 2 handles- It's very easy for my son to drag his feet on the wheels, which he does all the time just to make me madDefinitely more pros than cons! I guess I would recommend choosing a different stroller."
123930,1,"Trust me, I've tried them all. These are the best wipes. I have 3 dogs, so I carry one box in the car, & one box to the beach. Your hands will actually be very clean after you use them...no more germs either. I like that they have a slight amount of soap on them. I also use them to wipe my dogs eyes & ears... The dogs love them too, they are moist & soft."
13759,0,"We have four of these covers- one blue, two green, and a yellow. They definitely make the changing pad a more comfortable surface for our baby- he loves just hanging out on them. We leave a lap pad on the cover which is the first line of defense against accidents during changes. This somewhat reduces the frequency of cover washings. Some people have noted that they find these covers unnecessary- I'm sure the changing pad would be adequate by itself, but I just feel like the whole area is cleaner when I can throw the cover and pad into the laundry.Be advised that all our covers did shrink slightly after washing. They do, however, continue to fit well on the pad. The colors also faded slightly with washings."
163307,0,"We really liked the design of this changing pad and still use it occasionally. We started using it when our son was a newborn. We would change his diaper on this in the living room. It has no padding in the pad which makes it more compact, but certainly doesn't make it comfortable. I like that the pad is a wipeable, non-porous fabric, but that also means it's cold and plastic-y feeling for your baby. We started using it in the car, but it was too much of a hassle to get out and set up each time we wanted to change a diaper. Now, we just lay down a hand towel most of the time. The wipes case is very slim, hard to open, and the wipes dry out if they aren't used quickly enough. This may be a good option for some folks that might be using it on a daily basis and need a compact diaper changing station, but it didn't really work very well for us."
157742,0,Bought two for twin granddaughters. One twin did not mind the harness but the other one would have nothing to do with it...that's just her personality (very independent).
17982,1,"I really love these wall hangings. I've been looking for a feminine touch to my unisex, green nursery. These are great and the colors are beautiful. Also a very good price compared to many wall hangings I have considered. I would highly recommend them to anyone who loves butterflies."
54069,2,"I had purchased two of these mirrors for my car and my husband's.However, after taking our 4 day old baby to the fire station to have our infant car seat professionally checked over, we were told that these mirrors are not recommended and that they can actually harm your child in a car accident.We returned them immediately! Please check your baby products out."
171147,1,"Overall I like this carseat.. i have this as well as the combi double stroller. the features i like about his carseat are it is light weight and easy to carry, it has nice padding and an infant insert that makes baby nice and snug. this carseat does fit in some shopping carts, and doesn't fit in some, but in the ones it doesn't fit straight on, i just turn it sideways in the cart, and it fits fine. the base was a bit difficult to belt into the car since it is different than other bases i am usued to, but it had detailed directions on how to do it. also you have to make sure when you are putting the seat in to the base that it is actually locked in, you have to listen for 2 clicks and pull up just to be sure, because a few times i set the seat in and it wasn't all the way latched on when i thought it was. currently my baby is 2 months old and the way the seat belt is over her legs it makes it so she can't move her legs at all because the straps secure over her legs, i'm not sure if this is supposed to be like that or not. also you need to make sure the carrying handle is all the way up when riding in the car, which is different from most seats. also it is difficult to move carrying handle all the way back over the sun shade.. (i usued to move the handle all the way back with my sons carseat, but this one it is difficult, and actually i don't mind now that i'm used to it.) this works nice with the double stroller, which we use with our 2 year old.. the only thing is, the stroller is very narrow, so the carseat hangs over slightly in the area where the other kid sits, our son doesn't seem to mind, but for a larger kid it might not be comfortable. overall i would reccomend this carseat. the main reason i bought it was to go with the stroller."
138777,1,"We have had this nightlight for our son since birth, and before that we purchased the lady bug for our niece. I am not sure why some reviewers have problems with it being too dim, we have our son in a small bedroom, possibly 11 by 11, and with the turtle on the floor or a night stand it shines bright enough for us to see the stars on the ceiling and walls. We have also played with the turtle with our son, and I like that the body is soft and that the plastic has soft rounded edges. I can see him enjoying this night light for many years."
89014,1,I love the price for Pampers diapers that Amazon offers!!! Pampers is the ONLY brand my 10 month daughter can wear!!!! They are gentle on her skin and a perfect fit. We have had VERY FEW leaking out of the diaper accidents in the past 10 months and 99% of those were human error of improper placement.
119185,1,"This pillow is much better than the boppy. The cover is easily washable, the pillow is soft on my babies face, and it is comfortable for me to use."
7342,1,My 2 year old is obsessed with this blanket. She will find a tag anywhere but this is what comforts her most especially at bed time. It is healthy for children to self soothe and have a comfort item.
51896,0,"overall this is a great stroller, it rides smooth and fit my 4 month old great with the adjustable 5 point harness and head support insert. The seat back is adjustable which is nice so they sit upright or lay back. It also came with an infant carseat adapter and bug sheild. My only disappointments are that when the front wheel is in the unlocked position, the whole stroller wobbles horribly, it has to be locked when using outdoors at all times. I did use it in mall once with it unlocked (to aide in manuvering in tight spaces) however there was still a very notable ""sway"" on the smooth surface. The other disappointment is that it has a tendency veer off to the left making jogging with it a real challenge--but for the most part I believe it does this because the front wheel needs to be locked to avoid the wobbling. the parent tray is awesome--many compartments. There are also 2 other storage bins that offer plenty of space for just about anything. I can fit my winter jacket and diaper bag in the bin underneath the seat. Lastly, the sun canopy is not nearly big enough to actually shade the sun, however, I have read that you can use a Kiddopomantus sun shade and it attaches nicely for extended coverage."
93424,1,"This is the first potty chair we purchased for our daughter. When we realized we needed one for upstairs, I tried a different brand. Big mistake. This potty chair is 1-comfortable 2-easy to clean and most of all 3-catches what it's supposed to catch. We found the other model leaked a lot unless she was in just the right position. Although the music doesn't work properly, who cares. The chair design is excellent and I would highly recommend this product."
33873,1,I like this a lot. My daughter loves the song it plays. The only draw back is the way the mobile attaches. It is just a little hook. I don't know how other ones work.
74295,0,"The portable bassinet was great for a sudden trip to the grandparents, but my baby loves to move around. She would wake up and cry, because she couldn't move much. She's about a year old, but she's small for her age. It worked until we could get a pack & play. She was also able to roll out when she was trying to move a couple of times.This would be great for young babies that aren't yet rolling."
59273,1,"The ""Sleep Sheep"" has really been a lifesaver. We started using it when my daughter was a month old, and the sounds of the calming surf still work on her, three months later. The sounds are very soothing (there are 4: heartbeat, rain, surf, whale songs), there is a volume control knob - which is great (its not just ""high"" and ""low"" settings), and the sheep itself is just too cute!"
172911,1,I think that this would be a great product it just didn't work for my little lady. I think sha will be on a bottle until she is 5
62103,1,"A must have for travelers!! We bought these to take on our trip and they were a life saver in the airport bathrooms and airplane bathrooms where I didn't want my baby to touch anything. Just stood him up and put these diapers on one leg at a time. I will say that these diapers are NOT as good if your baby is not having solid poops. They ARE likely to leak poop juice if they have diarrhea compared to our Costco Huggies Diapers but its worth it to put these diapers on on wiggly toddlers who do not want to sit still on trips, etc."
78497,0,"I was given this pump by my SIL, who was unable to breastfeed her son. I had already had a Lansinoh Double Electric pump that I used faithfully (at least 4 times a week). I have been breastfeeding painlessly for almost 3 months now, but the Medela Double Select pump hurts!! It is much louder than my Lansinoh and cleaning it is a chore! I don't really like that there is the possibility that milk can get into the motor. That isn't even an option with my Lansinoh pump because of how its made, and cleanup of my Lansinoh doesn't require as much work as the Medela does. It does the job, but I'm much happier with my Lansinoh which works painlessly for me, and quicker too. I can get 6oz from each breast in 5 mins with my Lansinoh. It takes almost double the time with the Medela. And the Lansinoh is cheaper. :-)Like I said, it does the job but I would really recommend buying the Lansinoh Double Electric."
125316,1,"My little man has rejected all the teethers and/or pacifiers I have ever given him and this one worked! He loves it! The teether was a bit large for his mouth when we first got it, but he chewed all the other parts happily. Because the entire thing is soft, it gives them a lot of choices to chew even if it won't quite fit in their mouth yet. Now, if he's fussy and I get out the RaZberry - instant calm!"
75810,1,I purchased this for my car which is a Jetta and this fits perfectly and protects the bottom and back of the leather seats. It even has a place cut out for the car seat locks to attach to the metal hooks on the car and also hides them. The storage compartment on the front is very useful and i like that this covers the entire car seat we have which is a Chicco. The car seat does not slide at all when sitting on this mat. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with leather seats.
109475,1,Great price for two! My 7 month old loves thses feeders. To beable to put a cookie or biscuit in them and not worry about her having to chew it up is awesome.
174753,0,Received gate within posted shipping date. Product was poorly packaged (two flat pieces of cardboard with gate sandwiched and edges taped - not very secure) Gate works but hard to line up both latch and base level gate support on the bottom to lock gate.
9943,1,"After trying a couple of other seats, I broke down and bought this one. My son does very well with this seat. He can put the seat on and put himself onto the toilet. The most important part...the splash gaurd it adequate. I love the fact there is very little to clean up afterward. Before this seat I had to clean up every time. Urine seeped onto our seat and it was nasty. I never purchased a Baby Bjorn product. I always thought they were a little pricey, and I tend to be more practical. I am glad I got this seat. Could not be happier."
77782,2,"We bought this monitor over 18 months ago... It has so much static and interference it is horrible. but since we paid so much for it we have gotten used to it... Sad but true, I now sleep to the steady sound of static and clicking noses that misteriously appear out of nowhere from the monitor. But 18 months later now the monitor just stops it has red lights like it is on and when my toddler is crying you can see it but not hear it... I have had enough.. this is a terrible product and now we in search of a new monitor. We have a tri level house and I need a good monitor so I can hear my child not static or nothing..Save your money buy a different product something that will last....."
20042,1,"Dear all, regarding this ointment. I was suffering with my child's diper rash which last for 2months and it was resistant to all the creams I used; namely: alfacort, micostatin, pseudocreamAfter I used this special ointment which I love it's thick texture, my child's rash has improved markedly. I strongly recommend it. Thanks for reading my review. Be safe all"
52735,0,"This chair is as comfy as it looks. However if your baby is born &quot;big&quot;, don't expect them it be able to stay in it for very long. My beautiful &quot;little&quot; girl was born at 10 lbs. so she was only able to comfortably stay in it until she was about 2 1/2 months old--her legs were too long for it. Plus there isn't anything for them to look at or touch so as they get older, its a chair that's a little more boring than a bouncy seat that has lights/music and a bar with hanging toys."
67042,2,"I just purchased the stroller today. I put my 3 year old in it for a test run and strapped him in. Something caught his eye and he sat forward, and completely ripped the straps of the 5 point harness clear off the back of the stroller. My kid is not large, nor is he exceptionally strong. All he did was lean forward, and that caused the straps to rip. Shoddiest construction I've ever seen. My cheap $50 stroller has held up far better over the years. The damage is fixable... but now I have to sew the straps back on. That's not something you should have to do to a $350+ stroller before you even get it out of the driveway. Very disappointed."
8261,1,"We bought two of these and am glad we did. We have a flat changing table, and most of the covers seem to be for curved ones. I didn't think I could find my color, but this company did have a purple option. Score! These wash pretty well, and if I were better with the stain stick I'm sure they would remain spotless (mine are not). Glad we have two so there's always something covering the table regardless of how big a mess we made on the last change."
3038,1,"I received this as a shower gift (I'm a resurfacing new mother - my only child is now 11, so I'm starting over again...) and it was soooo easy to swaddle my newborn son. I remember struggling with my daughter to get her wrapped up in the receiving blanket and in a matter of minutes her wriggling out of the swaddle. With my son, he is cuddly in this swaddle for hours and sleeps soundly. Even my husband, who has two left thumbs can wrap him up snuggly without my help and supervision!My only thumbs down on this product is I notice that with repeated use my son can wriggle his arm out and it does it looser with age. Also, I notice it has a tendency to bunch up at the neck, so you have to be careful when you wrap the little one up in the swaddle. However, the benefits FAR outweigh those two glitches!"
24296,1,Nice sheet. I hang it to dry and it dries quickly. Stains seem to come out better on this sheet than the one that came with the crib and I think it has a better feel to it.
76445,1,We bought it to keep our newborn from rolling. We bought it the day after we brought him home from the hospital. He will not sleep without it (unless someone is holding him). We bought a second one because they take forever to dry.Really something we cannot do without!
30379,2,"I liked this tub at first. The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn. After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling. This was after ""squeezing"" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use. The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold.I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days. It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well. The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press. Especially when your hands are wet and slippery.It's a good thing BRU will take back anything! I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub."
12825,0,"This monitor brought me some peace of mind in my second pregnancy (my first ended in miscarriage). Before I could actually feel any kicks, I could use this monitor to HEAR him bumping around (late first/early second trimester). And later, when the baby was big enough that I COULD feel the kicks--- but he hadn't moved in a while--- this monitor was so sensitive that it would pick up small movements (ones I couldn't feel). It brought me great peace of mind.I agree that it's hard to hear the heartbeat--- I only heard it once--- but it's important to remember that these heartbeats don't sound like the ones you hear at the doctor's office. Instead of the whoosh-whoosh sound... it was closer to a thumping (make sure you don't confuse the baby's heartbeat with your own).My advice: if you want to hear your baby's heartbeat every time, don't buy this product-- but if you are the type of person who just wants to &quot;check in&quot; every once in a while to make sure he's moving (although I wouldn't use this as a replacement for the tried-and-true kick counts every 12 hours)... I'd give this product a try."
99228,1,I've been buying this kinds for the past few months because it's a good unit price for quality Pampers diapers and they are shipped right to my door.
12103,2,"For my first pregnancy I had the wedge made by ""Boppy"". It was a real life saver, and was so useful for before my daughter could sit up alone. I gave it away to a friend, and was forced to purchase a new belly wedge. I bought this one. I hate it. the material is ver rough, it doesn't follow the contour of my belly, nor does it stay in place. Spend your money elsewhere!"
109118,1,We bought this to turn our bumbo seat into a feeding station. We don't have a table so it made no sense for us to buy a high chair. This works great for us. We just sit on the floor with her and feed her.
54269,1,"My little one has loved this one since the first day we put it in. She was 8 weeks premature and so we didn't install it until she was almost 2 months old.She loved it from day 1! She looked at it sideways for a day or two. I think it was a bit much for her at first.She will watch it for at least 15 minutes and allows me to do stuff in the bedroom with her happy.At night we like to use it after her late night feedings. We take off the mobile part (very easy to do) and just have the music going because she can't see it and some of the pieces are designed to slide around and make more noise than we want. (our daughter sleeps in our room) The music puts us all to sleep.I have to agree that she does not drift off to sleep watching the mobile. I think there is just too much going on.She sure loves it, though!"
66665,1,"This stroller works great for my girls. 1 1/2 and 4. They both fit comfortably and enjoy the smooth ride the stroller provides. Excellent turning and steering control. Cloth cup holder works pretty well. The basket on the bottom doesn't have much of a lip, but I haven't dropped anything yet. It's heavy but opens and closes easily."
118349,2,"These work well enough as sippy cups and it is nice that the parts are interchangeable from bottle to sippy. However you don't save any money because all the parts cost more than most sippy cups. The real problem is that there are too many parts. Too much trouble to have to assemble and disassemble and make sure all the parts get washed and dried and not misplaced. There is the bottle itself, handles, screw cap, mouth piece, valve, and finally the cap."
75829,1,I bought two seat covers and they work great. They work great under car seats or booster seats.
166255,0,These diapers are great but I do prefer swaddlers version. They are not as soft as the swaddlers but aside from that they get the job done.
106958,1,"This diaper pail far excededs the Diaper Genie. There is no worrying about running out of refills. The bags are so easy to change. The pail can get a little smelly, but some lysol and the odor guard trash bags help a lot. Overall, a much more convenient and less expensive product than the Diaper Genie."
172644,2,The tub is too small especially when you put the shower unit in it. The shower has no pressure and is awkward to use. The button that must be depressed to make the shower work doesn't depress easily and is difficult to keep down. All in all I was very disappointed and am planning on taking it back after using it only one time.
79061,1,"The table and chairs are real good. I have only one suggestion. One of the wood boards of the chair seat came off while assembling. We had to fix it some glue and nails. If the manufacturer can see to it that all parts are securely made, it will be better."
99778,1,Best diapers I have bought for my children. Always happy and never a bad moment. A great bang for my buck! I will buy this product over and over as I have it on my subscribe and save subcriptions.
84019,1,"This toy box is well built and so soft on the outside. It goes perfectly with my 7 year old daughter's room. I would highly recommend this item, definitely worth the money."
116159,1,"I write this as I just finished installing two carseats in my van with the new EZ latch attachment. I have a 2001 Chrysler T&C, and it has been difficult (at best) to install carseats with the type of seatbelt that comes standard. The seatbelt wasn't secure enough on its own, even though the manual says that the ""lock"" on the seatbelt clip was enough to hold carseats. We have had to use a clip-- and I wouldn't consider that the safest option. We also had trouble with our 3 year old sneaking in and just undoing the seatbelt latch without our knowing. Now the locks are out of her reach and the seat is in so tight that is hardly moves at all! Our carseats are both Century Next Step DX's. They installed with ease. I would HIGHLY recommend this new attachment. It is very easy to use and works very well."
158781,1,"When my child was born, I had read so much about SIDS that I pulled even the bumper pads out of my son's crib. I was thrilled to find the Halo SleepSack to keep him warm and cozy, yet safe. I purchased a couple of these in each size as he grew, and he reluctantly gave them up after he was 2 1/2 (I was concerned about him tripping because he insisted on wearing it while walking; however I think they have since come up with a version that allows the feet to poke through).I bought this one for my niece, and it's been great."
7985,1,"Actually is a GREAT portable gym. My daughter enjoy a lot this gym, and she have 5 months!You can add toys (from linkadoos) to make it more entertainment."
59289,1,"This was the cheapest option for us. Installation takes about 45 min with two people working, and I recommend using an ice pick to help you get the string through the net to tie it at top, bottom and sides."
160164,1,"This wrap really does make it easier to swaddle your baby - moreover, it makes it harder for the swaddling to come undone, saving you time and effort. At such a reasonable price, it's worth getting two so you'll always have a clean one on hand."
120464,0,"We got this unit primarily cause of the motion sensor. The motion sensor works as advertised for us but I can see why some people have issues with it.What I like:- it has a motion sensorWhat I don't like- consistent interference problems - the monitor does not have a ""activate only on sound"" option so it's always transmitting and the receiver is always receiving - this is rather annoying at any volume above ""quiet"" since you'll always hear some sort of hum from it- shoddy build quality - the switches and the plastic feel kinda cheap and any drop higher than 2-3 feet will most likely destroy the device. We had a transmitter fail after a 3 foot drop - it still transmitted audio but sensor no longer worked - had to replace it"
47423,2,This car seat has a bounce rod on the back which makes it too big to fit in most of the cars. I was advised by the Plano Police Car Seat Inspections to return it
4510,1,"We bought this high chair for our daughter and we love it. It's easy to use and set up. I would have given five stars but to unfold/fold it you need two hands which sometimes isn't too ""handy"" when you have a crying baby in one of the them. The seat adjusts up and down so your child can sit right at the table with you. As stated above, the legs fold together so you can store the chair when not using. The chair cover is also easy to take off when it needs to be cleaned(which we do in the tub) and is attached with snaps. My little one is ten months old, 19 pounds, 27.5 inches and not even close to outgrowing this chair. I definitely recommend this chair. Hope this helps!!"
149702,1,"I bought this for my 2yr old for Christmas. It is well made and was easy for Santa to assemble. Her different dolls all fit in it well and she loves it. The only drawback is that it needs a piece that separates legs on dolls. Her bitty baby 15""doll falls through under the tray because she does not have enough support. We have to make that doll do the splits and put its legs through the sides just to make her sit up in the chair. We did not want to buy a smaller chair so that the larger dolls would fit. Overall, the chair meets expectations and is played with daily."
139467,1,"I bought this for my 9 month old granddaughter who doesn't like to fall asleep right away, she loves laying there talking to the stars until she falls asleep. We love it!"
46018,1,I got this mobile when my daughter was 2 months old. The instant I put her under it she started cooing and smiling. I loved how unique it looks and how you can change the image cards. I would change the cards once a month and it was like a brand new toy! The only thing I did not like about this product was that you had to manually turn it. But otherwise our family loved it!
47750,2,"My daughter has reflux and we purchased this wedge in the hopes that she'd be comfortable sleeping on her back in the crib while slightly elevated. This is not helpful. We placed it under her sheets and mattress cover but all my daughter did was slide right down or off to the side. You can probably get the same effect from strategically folding towels. I wouldn't recommend this to help your baby with reflux sleep.Ultimately, we purchased the the Fisher Price Rock 'n Play for our daughter instead after reading a bunch of reviews from parents with refluxy babies and our daughter LOVES it. It sits at an angle, cuddles the child's sides, and allows you to physically rock the baby back and forth as she goes to sleep. Unhappily, our girl loves it so much that she's still sleeping in it at 8 months and we can't figure out how to get her to a crib -- but the wedge isn't the way to do it."
144045,2,This pillow is NOT worth the price!!!!!!! It has very little stuffing in it........ Its not very fluffy.......... Kinda flat and it has two different sections. It is not very comfortable and only slightly better than no pillow at all!!!!!!!!Look into better options for the price!!!!
114115,0,"I would rate this booster seat as 5 stars, EXCEPT that the white snap-on tray is a terrible pinching hazard once your child gets old enough to reach across and pull up the far edge of the tray. Then the darn thing snaps right back down, scaring your baby (and only that, if you're lucky), or pinching her fingers.I called Fisher Price, and have to say that I was less than impressed with their customer service. All I could do was send it back. There wasn't a way to get a suggestion to their design people or do anything other than get a refund. (Don't get me wrong, a refund is great... if there were anything better on the market.)We just use it without the white snap-in tray now."
11863,0,"This feeder is a great idea! Except, it's pretty much disposable! The feeding bag looks horrible after the very first time we used it (we put a third of a banana - the leftovers are impossible to wash off!) It's going to be pricy to buy the set of extra bags if it's good enough only for 1-2 feedings.The manufacturer needs to come up with a new idea of a reasonable and practical replacement bags, FIRST!I'm not buying it again! :-(PS: read my full review at: [...]"
146366,1,"I purchased this jumperoo, it arrived and I put it together. After having it almost completely put together, I realized the rainbow arch did not have the colorful rainbow stickers on it. I called Fisher Price to see if they could just send the stickers to me. I was told that the stickers were unavailable for them to do that. I feel like this is a part on the toy that is beneficial for babies since it is brightly colored and would attract my daughter's attention. The representative then went on to tell me that if I wanted to send the seat to them (the seat part ONLY), they would replace the entire jumperoo. I asked how long this process would take...was told UP TO 6 WEEKS! By that time, my daughter would be almost 6 1/2 months old...and my oldest daughter walked at 9 months - so why bother? I am an Amazon Prime Member - so I can have stuff shipped free in 2 days! I printed off the return label (a FREE benefit of being a Prime Member) explaining why I was returning, repackaged the jumperoo, and it was picked up by UPS the next day. I reordered another jumperoo and it arrived 2 days later. Problem...it didn't have the rainbow stickers either! I decided rather than going through all of that again to just live with the fact that the stickers aren't there. My daughter laughs and jumps and has a great time in this toy and I like it much better than the jumpers that hang in the doorway (I have one of those that I used with my other two children). The only reason this doesn't have a 5 star is due to the fact that Fisher Price has apparently sent a batch of ""non-sticker having"" jumperoos to Amazon (or whomever ships the product) and they don't have the means to supply people with replacements."
37864,1,I received this as a babyshower gift and was surprised at everything it had in it. The equipment was good quality and the scissors are sharp so it makes cutting nails easy. I highly recommend this kit.
61323,2,This was a nightmare to assemble. I don't like buying the refills and it fills up FAST.I broke the hinges trying to refill it the first time.I will try the ...next time - you can use your own bags. :)
63908,1,"My 5-week old has been waking me up every hour at night since we brought him home. I thought I'd tried everything to make him sleep longer: warm bath, tight swaddle, full tummy, etc. Each time he would wake up, he had wiggled his arms out from under his blanket... no matter how tightly swaddled. I got the Swaddle Me yesterday and last night... he only woke up TWICE!!! Love it!"
91323,0,If you have a large number of electronics don't get this one.
124283,1,"My toddler likes playing in toilet water. That had to stop. I didn't get this to prevent her from drowning (there's not that many children who drown, choke, or get kidnapped, really.) But to see her get her hands wet made me angry. This latch is really strong, and I showed my toddler how to put the latch up. She likes lifting the latch, locking it in place. She doesn't know how to lower it. Here's hoping she won't figure that out for at least a year."
22140,1,These are good bags. It's convenient that they fit on the Medela pumps. The only downfall I've had is that they are a little small. 3 oz is about the max you can fit if you want to freeze your milk.
46162,1,"February 2011, 3 stars:I was excited when one of my friends purchased this mobile off our registry for us because I'd read such excellent things about it. Well, it arrived yesterday. I put it together last night and here is my review.I want to like it. I love the idea of the interchangeable high-contrast cards to keep a baby interested. I knew it didn't have a motor and planned to have a fan circulating air in the nursery, which would move the cards a little bit. I knew people had had breakage troubles with some of the parts so I was careful in my assembly and indeed did not break anything. However, it still falls short of what I'd hoped for.First, I agree with other reviewers that it is very cheaply made. The various plastic components are different shades of ""white"" (one reviewer said the arm and crib attachment were lavender and that's about right).Second, the crib attachment piece is non-adjustable. If your crib slats or edges are too skinny or too wide (like mine is), it simply will not fit. However, I imagine if your crib is too skinny you could find something to act as a spacer and get it to wedge on there just fine.Third, as mentioned, the mobile doesn't fit on my crib. I have the Baby Mod Park Lane crib from Walmart and the edge panel of the crib is just slightly too wide for this mobile to fit. For the time being, I have figured out a much less secure way to attach it, but we will probably just end up trashing the plastic arm and crib attachment piece and hanging the mobile itself from the ceiling.Fourth, as other reviewers have mentioned, you'd think that all of the cards would be interchangeable but they're not. Some cards are designed to be vertical and some are designed to be horizontal. Therefore, your selection of cards to display to the baby is limited to only the fronts & backs of the horizontally-designed cards. I'm not sure what the purpose of the vertical cards is other than to look pretty for Mom and Dad.Fifth, it *is* difficult to switch the cards out. Because I knew that people had broken theirs, I took my time and tried not to force anything. It definitely required a bit of patience and some twisting/turning this way and that. Fortunately, I was successful and did not break any of the tabs off the cards but I can see how it would be easy to.Sixth, the notches of the vertical cards inserted into the slits of the horizontal cards (the ones baby sees) is a very tight fit. This causes the horizontal cards to sit at an angle. I am crossing my fingers that these ""joints"" will loosen and relax over time, perhaps if I take a few minutes to wiggle them each a little bit whenever I think of it.Like I said, I want to like this mobile. I love the concept and the images are pretty cool. However, I wish the crib attachment fit my crib. I wish that all of the cards could be used horizontally rather than only half of them. I wish the plastic arm and crib attachment didn't look so cheap. And I hope the plastic cards relax a little so that the images hang straight down rather than at an angle. If I have my husband hang this from the ceiling and remove the plastic arm and crib attachment I will eliminate two of these problems so that's what I will probably do.I'm really glad my friend only paid $11 for this. That's about as much as I would feel comfortable having paid or having had someone else pay for this right now given its limitations.***UPDATE 11/30/12***I just wanted to update that my husband and I did end up hanging this mobile from the ceiling on a small hook via clear fishing line (very light-weight) and it actually worked quite well. My son LOVED this mobile for months so I switched out the cards regularly to keep him stimulated. Around 5-6 weeks, he started doing his ""exercises"" for about 20 min. straight at a time where he'd just lie under the mobile and kick and wiggle like crazy as it gently spun. We tossed the plastic arm and crib attachment that came with the mobile but the mobile itself really did prove its value. I've saved it for #2.Btw, as our son got older and was able to reach out to the mobile, we simply tied the mobile higher up the line. Simple. We kept doing that until he was able to stand and reach it and then we just cut it down.I have increased this product to 4 stars because, in the end, it ended up doing what we had hoped it would do."

11391,2,"This the first review I've ever written and I'm only doing it to save somebody else some money. This has got to be the worst monitor ever. I've used it for less than 2 years and it is just horrible. Horrible reception, horrible battery life, and now I can't even get sound from it unless I wiggle the plug into it. One of the receivers is taped up and I still only get sound every once & a while. I have to buy a new baby monitor. Very disappointed. Would have given it negative stars if I could have."
37537,1,Our experience has been excellent but then we have a small dog which is not able to hang on the gate and we were able to anchor into wall studs. Installation was as easy as could be expected and our Cairn terrier who managed to scale our temporary fence has no luck with this one because there are no horizontal bars for him to get a foot hold. Easy to open and easy to lock shut it has been a perfect appliance to keep our puppy in the kitchen area. I just wish it was offered in wood tones. We don't use the alarm.
62930,2,"I bought this snoogle mini because I was having trouble sleeping mid pregnancy and felt I need support under my growing belly. I bought the mini since I'm only 5'2'' and didn't want the regular snoogle kicking my husband out of bed. Unfortunately, I returned it. It was uncomfortable to tuck between my legs and under my belly. It felt too short. I also felt it was too hard. I tried the variety of positions but it still didn't feel comfortable to me. I prefer hugging a regular pillow lengthwise along my belly for support, or a body pillow would also be great."
159372,1,"We have 2 bouncy chairs, in this one my daughter can lean over far enough that she would fall out if she was not held by the belt but she has fallen far enough that she can not get back up though.(this is without the light bar on) Our other seat has a deeper butt section and does not have this problem.They do like the light bar and music"
51809,2,"After waiting about 4 weeks (my order was kept put on backorder), I cancelled the order."
75596,0,"Nice dresser for the money. Whatever they package it with left lightly noticeable tape like marks on it. Had to buy some touch up paint to cover the ones I couldn't wipe off. I have to agree with the other reviews regarding the assembly, not a easy task took several hours."
13495,1,"I purchased this for an exposed power strip in my husbands office. Our daughter always heads straight under his desk to all the cords and outlet. This cover does the job perfectly! It is large enough to fit the bigger plugs including cellphone chargers under the lid. It is not extremely difficult to open to an older child may be able to figure it out, but it is perfect for us at the moment."
35863,1,"I used disposables, always wanting to use cloth, when we decided to have another child, I made the commitment. I have Fuzzi Bunz and these. I don't know if it's the way we are trying to use the Fuzzi's , but they leak A LOT!!! These are great, they take a little longer than the pocket diapers to dry, but they are very absorbant and don't leak!!!! We put a fleece liner in to keep the pee off of my son's skin, and to catch the poop. The fabric did stain a little, but it's hardly noticable! It's a diaper anyways, who cares? I want to try out some BumGenius and see if I like them better......but I think these are better than Fuzzi Bunz.....I don't think these are going to fit my newborn when it's born, but I got some Kushies Premie and Fuzzi Bunz small......I hope they don't blow out with those newborn poopies......"
59317,2,"I was VERY disappointed when receiving this product and returned it immediately. I needed something to cover 22' of banister, and this was not going to do the trick. It seemed flimsy and I didn't feel safe putting it up. Instead, I went to Lowes and purchased a 25' segment of Poultry Fencing (who would have thought?!). It is MUCH more sturdy and for $15 was a better use of my money. We zip-tied it to the banister and I am so surprised with the quality. I do not recommend this product. Go to Lowes, get a better deal for a safer and better alternative. And, it doesn't look as bad as I thought!"
162181,2,"We used this bathtub for our daughter from the ages of birth to 18 months. Worked reasonably well, it was a good size to fit in the tub, big enough to have plenty of water in there for cleaning, and yet small enough to save water (rather than using the whole tub). However, there were some problems.Due to the way the tub is shaped, you need to tip it over in order to fully empty it. There is a drain at the bottom but not enough sloping on the bottom to allow all the water to fully drain. This means you have to lift up and tip over the tub each time you want to clean it... Leading to the next problem.The suction cups that are on the bottom of the tub can break off, unless you reach around and loosen each one when you lift up the tub. Three of the four suction cups on ours broke off, two of them actually broke the plastic and one caused a hole in the bottom of the tub. We patched it but you don't want to hassle with that.Lastly, the two-piece nature of this tub can lead to leaks. We couldn't figure out exactly how it leaked or where it was leaking from, but every once in a while when the baby shifted, a bunch of the water would leak out. If you don't put this thing inside a tub, you may end up with large amounts of water on the floor.So, we don't recommend it. It's not durable enough. We're expecting our second and we're about to purchase a new one. We'll review that one when we've got some experience with it :)"
11001,2,"My parents purchased one of these when they were unable to find a second Cooshie Booster for when we visit with our kids. It is inferior to the Cooshie Booster in the following ways:1) booster is so short, it hardly gives your child a ""boost""2) base of booster is not solid, so you cannot easily raise it using pillows or large books3) the kids find it to be uncomfortable4) plastic is slippery on hard surface seatsGiven a choice, my kids (ages 3 & 5) will never choose to sit in this booster -- they fight over the Cooshie Booster instead!"
113367,1,"I have had my monitor for 8 months now and I love it!! I have had no probelms with it what-so-ever! The best feature is the portable baby unit that attaches to her crib. I don't know what you'd do without that! So conveinent! I keep it on the charger durring the day, and attach it to her crib at night. It lasts all night, and the few times I've forgotten to turn it off and put it back in the morning, it's still working off the charger that next night! I do wish the parent unit was like this too, however, I haven't found it necessary...only for my own forgetful conveinence!I leave the parent unit plugged in by my bedside, but the few times I've used the battery and walked with it clipped to me, it was very easy, well heard, never cut in and out, and lasted a long time.I like the light gaging system too. As she is getting older, she has fussed more in her sleep without it being a true wake. Therefore, I can turn the monitor down low enough that the sleeping noises she makes do not keep me up all night, but if she truly wakes, I can hear it and look up to see I'm not dreaming! (which I have done quite a few times!) It's also nice if you are entertaining and purhaps, watching a movie. Being able to monitor the baby with the lights, without the interuptions of a noisy monitor is very nice. However, if you want to turn it up and hear every breath, it is very sensitive, and works this way attached to the crib rail no problem!I am very happy with this monitor and only hope it lasts for all the children I plan to have. I reccomend it to all my friends!"
22969,2,"I ordered this expecting what is displayed, but was sent a place mat that is all white with 6 outlined boxes on it with 1, 2, 3 and a, b, c in the middle of the boxes in yellow and red. I think it is ugly and not what I wanted. I email the seller and they got back to me right away apologizing saying there is a mistake in the ad and will refund my money, but I have yet to see a refund (this was a week ago) and I see they still have not changed the picture to show what you will actually get."
54866,1,"Like another reviewer, I too did not buy a mobile until my twins were over a month old because I could not find one that I thought would be interesting enough and actually help in my babies' development. The colors are vibrant and there are many things going on to hold the interest of the babies. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because of the noise. It is squeaky and the beads make a lot of noise sliding up and down, but I'm sure it bothers me much more than it bothers the babies. It doesn't keep them from falling asleep. Also, when they are awake and I am busy changing one of the babies or making bottles, it keeps them entertained until I come to get them. I am very glad to have this mobile, and because the music box detaches from the mobile, I will be able to use it even after it is no longer safe to have the mobile on the crib so it was well worth the money."
99192,0,The best thing about this product was the amazing price I got through Amazon.com combined with being an amazon mom. Diapers are diapers for the most part. The price is the deal.
179663,0,"We bought the go-go kidz travelmate because it is pretty much the only thing available to allow you to travel with a toddler carseat. It was difficult to manuever. It did not fit through most of the airplane aisles. I had to carry the carseat, the diaper bag, and my toddler making it for an interesting trip. Also, the wheel popped off when we took it out of the taxi! However, there are really no other products available to allow you to take a toddler seat with you when you travel."
11415,1,"i dont understand why all these ppl are writing neg reviews. we live in a house with a finished basement and havent had any issues with this monitor. my son is going on 3 yrs old. im buying another set for my twins bc i loved how sensitive this monitor was, i could hear him breathing! also i have walked across my street to the neighbors house while my son was napping and had NO problems even in her house! i have the old white monitor and love the upgrades to the grey one. it CLEARLY says in the instructions to not leave it plugged into the AC adapter for longer then 10 hrs bc it will burn out the rechargable battery. this monitor is meant to be portable, u charge it, then use. so if your monitor has gone ""BAD"" chances are its by your own doing and not a faulty monitor."
150022,1,"I got these for my 16 month old and my just-turned-3 year old because we were going to be making two long road trips this summer. The first trip we took was two days - about 8 hours each day. My 3yo loved it, but my 16mo hated it. My 3yo used it for coloring, playing with trains, and loved putting his sippy cup in the side pockets. My 16mo wouldn't even let me put it on.The trays are soft foam, and at first I was worried that they wouldn't be hard enough to hold shape, but that was fine. I like that they are light weight and can be removed and tossed to the back easily when not in use. The can even be folded up pretty small and stored in the back of the van, which is something the hard plastic trays won't do.My only concern with this tray is that it won't hold up long term. I guess it doesn't need to last forever, but it would be nice if it still held its shape a couple of years from now. We'll see.I'd say it's definitely worth the money, especially if you're going on long road trips."
120739,1,"We installed 2 gates, 1 @ the bottom and 1 @ the top of our stairs. We have twins who started crawling at 7 1/2 mos and they figured out how to climb stairs quickly so the gates were a necessity. They are easy to open for our 5 year old and I can even manage to open them while holding both girls. Our previous gates were self closing also, but you had to lift the whole gate up to open it which eventually cause both gates to break. These seem very durable. Also the included extenders were very helpful as our openings were wider than the gate by itself. Both girls try to hang on the bottom gate and it does not budge!"
85009,1,"This blanket is great. It is pretty much permanently tied to his car seat-- when he is dozing off, I flip it over.. when it is raining out I flip it over to keep him dry on way from car to house...you can also untie it and use it to sit on in the park. It's a great blanket."
158526,1,"This is a great sleep sack for warmer nights. I really appreciate how HALO has the zipper at the bottom of the sack when zipped up. The sack does shrink in the dryer but it did not shrink substantially for me. I also have the fleece version (which did not shrink when washed) and the fleece version (same size) is definitely larger. So if your baby wears a certain size in the fleece version but is close to the next size up, go ahead and size up for the cotton version.We use this sleep sack when it is slightly warmer. While it is pretty thin, when it gets more into summer I think it would probably be too much for baby at night (obviously dependent on what baby is wearing too). The thickness is similar in my opinion to a Carter's cotton footed pajama, maybe even very slightly thicker.For colder nights, we really like the fleece version:HALO SleepSack Applique Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Lime Green, Medium"
183398,1,"This swing is very large, takes up a lot of room when set up, and doesn't fold very flat. The mobile is useless and the nature sounds are pretty bad, but the classical music is the best music I've come across on a baby product yet. It has decent sound quality and a nice assortment of songs. The battery life seems very good - we used it on and off for several months and still have the first set of batteries in it. The reclined position was great for putting our son to sleep when nothing else worked (from about 1 to 3 months old). I can't speak to the sitting position because our son isn't interested in the swing anymore, but it's been a good swing and I'm glad we had it."
161717,2,"We received this tub as a shower gift. I was so excited. Well we put the tub together. We filled it up and used on my new counter top when we noticed water was all over my floor and counter top. We tried multiple times and finally we just decided to give our baby a bath in the sink. I read the instructions again and pushed hard on the middle to lock the tub so water doesn't leak. This time I tried in the bathroom countertop. I did not see any water leaking, so I proceeded to give the baby a bath and little did I know there was water on my floor and counter top. I hate that thing. I am right now going to get another bath tub for my little one. I would not recommend this tub."
12363,2,"Even though I had read poor reviews of this monitor, I was determined to buy it since it matched my theme. I figured that my experience would be different. Unfortunately, it wasn't! If you love listening to FUZZ, then this is the monitor for you! It's actually hard to hear what my baby is doing over the fuzz! If I could do it all over again, I'd listen to the reviews & buy one that was proven to work well for my baby!"
155859,1,I bought the foot shaped teether for my daughter and she loves it! Great product for the money I would recommend this to anyone looking for a teether.
81799,1,"There are no real surprises here, although I bought this thinking it was the same size as another I had and it was a bit bigger, making it more difficult to use as planned. There is a strap to screw into the back of your changing area, so it won't fall off, if you choose. I thought that was an interesting feature."
153881,1,"These work well, I liked them more before Seventh Generation changed the formula in thier wipes earlier this year. They still are a healthier alternative to the wipes that contain chemicals/perfumes."
21113,1,I love these diapers. They are the only ones that fit my daughter well. No leak problems whatsoever.
166864,1,Great quality and is a great idea. No more piles of blankets on baby!
61753,1,"I have a toddler, just turned 3 and I bought this carseat when my infant outgrew her infant seat at 6 months old. I have an evenflo convertible carseat that reclines that I had my son in from 7 months till this one at 2 1/2 and absolutely love it still! My daughter now has it so I bought this one for my son. I shopped a lot for his carseat and kept coming back to this one. I finally got over the extra cost and bought it and am so glad I did. He tried it out in the store and liked it.His legs in other carseats stuck almost straight out because the seat was so deep. With this carseat his legs bend right at the knee where they are supposed to. I have it hooked up using latch, the best and easiest latch design now, and can still use the recline function as long as I recline the seat a little too (Can do that with my Expedition middle seats too). He falls asleep all the time in it and the adjustable head support keeps his neck from kinking.It has the highest safety and crash ratings of all carseats which is very important.It's also very padded and comfortable. My son has never complained in the 8 months or so we've had it, and you can sink your hand down in the padding. Very nice.I occasionally put my daughter in it who is 13 months and I can adjust the head support down to her level and she fits just right in it too. I wouldn't suggest it for under about 10-12 months though unless your child is very tall, the head support doesn't go down far enough for a small infant.I love my evenflo convertible, and I love this one just as much!I won't have to buy another carseat until my son is ready for a plain booster, and then my daughter will have this one.And the pattern and color match my two tone interior."
146216,1,"I bought this for my 4 month old son. He likes it, esp the spinning crocodile that makes a rattle sound. He enjoys it so much that he spends 20-40 minutes there bouncing and playing!! Good buy."
103666,0,"I wanted another set of shields for my Medela pump. My supply was not great so I thought that I would try these but I didn't see a difference. In fact, I don't think that these are any more comfortable than the hard plastic ones and just like others have said, these won't last as long (they warp some). The hard plastic ones are easier to clean and last longer. So, I don't think this is a BAD purchase but if you are expecting miracles you will be disappointed."
81754,1,"I have two changing pads. The first one is the one that just flat on the surface. And this is the second one. I personally thought it is better to have a contoured shaped since it holds the baby in their position better. I still used it for after bath moment for my daughter who is now 14 months old. And now that she is bigger, the contoured shapes still hold her in her position (she can rollover if she wants to but with more effort compared to the flat one).I have no complaint for its durability. Love it!"
9067,2,"Not loud enough! Shuts off after cd is played, I wanted a repeat button. CD skips alot, light is too dim. The positive point is that it clips nicely to the crib."
157538,1,"Purchased this as a gift for a soon-to-be-mom relative. It is so cute, I'm sure she will love it. Arrived in very good time."
135993,2,"Every time I've used it, it smokes and makes the food taste a little burned. I've tried only pulsing it for short periods, to see if that keeps it from over heating, but to no avail. If I could choose all over again, I'd spend a little more and get a small Cuisinart processor."
6530,2,"It is very tricky because you would think is the same size of box what Babiesrus sells and sounds like such a good price for it but when you get it delivered you see that is way less quantity then you used to buy your value pack pampers,so my advice for other purchasers is to pay attention to the quantity before you think is a good deal."
29123,0,"After I bought this stool I found some at Ikea for $3.00, They're just as nice except you have no color but white with blue dots on the part you step on."
46209,0,"When I purchased the diapers I thought Amazon always had decent prices and at a minimum would be the same as the store and hopefully cheaper. Unfortunately I found out that I paid a lot more for these diapers than I would have at any store near me.Oh well, lesson learned."
4339,1,"I bought this caddy for my Bob Revolution SE and it works perfectly. I had it placed in no time and it holds my water bottle great when I run. In my opinion, this is the same caddy as the one made by Bob, but 2x cheaper. I would highly recommend this caddy."
111908,1,The gate was a little tricky to install-definately a two person job. Once installed the gate is secure. My only recommendation is to get better screws for the wall. The ones included were poor quality.
41819,1,This monitor works so well... you can hear every sound the baby makes! I was getting some feedback for a few days until i realized I had my cordless phone too close to the reciever (the cordless phone also distorts my tv if it is too close!). I highly recommend this monitor!!!!!
146521,1,"We stared using this jumperoo when my son was about 4 months old until about 10 months of age. We really liked it and found it very useful. My son was entertained by it. He enjoyed the music and the little toys attached to the jumperoo. He particularly liked the spinning lizard. Even now (he is 13 months old), he likes to stand by the jumperoo and play with the toys. This jumperoo was pretty easy to put together and we found it very stable and safe. I wish it had higher weight limit - but this is my only complaint. I would recommend it!"
133655,1,My son loves this seat. He feels like a big boy when he gets to use the big potty all by himself. I put the hook for the seat so he can get to it on him own and so this is ideal for him and it is nice because I don't have to wash out a little potty chair. The only thing that would make it nicer is if it had handles. Not a big deal at my house because the toliet is close to a wall so he uses that for support but I think it would make him feel more secure. I would recommend this for anyone with a child who wants to use the big potty.
76271,1,I absolutely love these trays. The lids are great in case I don't get to put the food in to baggies right away. Once the food is frozen if I run a little hot water on the bottom the cubes pop right out no problem. Really couldn't be happier with these.
133193,2,"This is the absolutely worst diaper waste system I've ever encountered!!My little one was 2 months premature...needless to say, the diaper ""do"" was at an extreme minimum. Even with about 5-6 diapers in the pail, it still smelled horrible. I had to put the entire thing in the garage (abou 100 yards from the house) in order to get rid of the smell.If you can, designate a pail in the garage or outside of the house somehow for your dirty diapers. I'm relegated to putting them into a Ziploc and bringing them to the garage when I have a chance.Pretty disgusting, yes, but better then the stentch that came from this ""product"".Also, the replacement bags are only available (at least where I am) at BabiesRUs and we don't have one here so I had to order on-line, etc.One positive - and the ONLY reason for the 1 star - is the design. If the makers of this could figure out how to keep the smell in the pail itself, it would be a wonderful thing. The way the bag is continuous, etc. is great. Too bad it smells!!If anyone wants it, it's your's for the taking!!!"
83085,1,"So after ordering about 4 different sets of sectioned bowls and returning every single one of them I finally found one that works great. I gave it 4 stars only because the lids are a little hard to get on but that is tupperware for you, which means they don't leak. Other than that they are great. Each section is big enough for my 5 month old and I can definitly see me using these well into his toddler years. Plus the colors are not ugly at all."
101566,2,"Water does pool, as other reviewers note, but my bigger problem is how quickly the plastic degrades. I've used this for about a year, and every few times when I clean it another piece of the center structure (where the sections screw together) cracks and breaks off. I don't think I'm particularly hard on this, and like very much the way it looks. But now the bottom plate has cracked in the middle. I sure hoped I'd be able to get through sippy cups and into commuter mugs, but I guess not!"
165756,2,"I AM SO DISSAPOINTED WITH THE NEW BABY DRY DIAPERS .I have been using Pampers cruisers for my son and have rarely had any leakage ..Maybe an occassional leak which is not bad.I was happy with Pampers.I decided to give ""Baby Dry"" a try bcos it claimed to have a more absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I am sooo disappointed. The core seems to be WAAAAAYYY inferior to the Cruisers core and leaks !! I started using them a few days back and my son has woken up atleast 5 nights crying bcos he was soaking wet !! :(This morning I was holding him and my shirt felt wet. The diaper was leaking and it went thru his clothes onto mine !! So its not just about night time leaks. So much for absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I was better off with my tried and trusted Cruisers.NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD CASE OF LEAKS WITH CRUISERS .......WILL NEVER USE BABY DRY DIAPERS AGAIN.I hope Pampers is not dropping its quality :("
105150,1,"I registered for another diaper pail, but I am soooo glad my mom got us this one instead. It just uses regular trash bags and is easy to clean.I had heard the diaper genie reduces odor better, but this works great. No smells leak out at all. And best of all, it has great capacity!! I have friends who have the diaper genie, and they have to empyt it ALL THE TIME. We can go almost a full week without emptying.LOVE IT. AM SO HAPPY WE GOT THIS ONE INSTEAD."
122159,2,"This pack takes 10-15 minutes to put on. Who has 10-15 minutes when you're getting out of the car to go shopping, or whatever? This is not an ideal carrier at all. The previous Snugli design was much better, more comfortable, and easier to work with."
156766,2,"The box says that the item is foldable and does not mention anywhere on it that assembly is required. The picture made me think that the item in the box was an assembled (or partially assembled), folded product. When I opened the box, I was surprised that not one piece was pre-assembled.I'm handy and enjoy assembling items. After forty five minutes of making it through half of the assembly instructions I got frustrated. For an expensive ""Ultra"" toy with cheap plastic pieces, this item should be ready to go. It requires too much work for a new parent.I do NOT recommend."
112197,1,Great! We use this brand diapers with both of our daughters and I typically order them online b/c it's cheaper than in stores and they ship so quickly I get them before I need to make a mad dash to the store when we run out.
107925,0,The suction is not there. I have found that if you use a smaller bottle (4 oz size) there is not a problem But if I use anything bigger the suction is horible it is very frusterating to use expecially now that I can pump as much a 9 ounces out of one side at a time its a lot of work to stop one forth the way through to empty a bottle so that I have enough room to keep pumping
153214,1,"I was worried about buying this car seat after reading all the reveiws. I followed my gut feeling and bought it. I got this car seat about a week ago, and I LOVE IT. My son enjoys taking car rides now. Hes so comfortable. I like how the head rest moves up and down as the child gets older and taller. Its well made and really cute colors. It installs great in my grand am. Its also a great price for the car seat."
12051,1,I bought this pillow on a whim not having much faith since it was only $9.99. It was the best money ever spent! I have always been a left-side sleeper so I didn't think sleeping while pregnant would be difficult. By my 5th month I my would wake up with my hips aching. Just wedging the pillow under my side would make all the difference in the world.
115731,1,"When i first saw my friend who had this stroller I was amazed at how easy and flat it folded.I wanted an umbrella stroller but needed a 5 point harness, and didn't want to strain my back by having the handles of the stroller up to my knees.The handles are still slightly lower than my Heavy duty stroller but it handles VERY well, it is sturdy, takes up very little space and is (mommy) fool proof (Daddy still has trouble...).Don't fool yourself, the back does recline, but just a few inches (which is better than nothing).I really enjoy chances when i need to use it."
12459,2,I had been using the lansinoh milk storage bags and ran out so I tried these bags. I found them very hard to use. The Lansinoh bags have a zip top like the gerber bags yet I have not had a problem with them leaking. I was very dissappointed in these bags since you have to place them in a cup and they are awkward and don't lay flat when frozen. I have a supply of milk in my freezer and if I couldn't lay them flat I would have no room for my other freezer items. I was extremely happy with the lansinoh bags and would reccommend them instead of these.
104628,1,"No complaints here, I just wanted to add that you can get a better price (2 locators for the price of 1) through Costco's website and you don't need a membership to buy it."
127792,2,"The good.Size is great, really convenient. Battery life is excellent (the rechargeable batteries rock).The bad.2.4 Ghz one would think it had great range and clarity, sorry folks you ain't getting that in this baby. Also if you have a wireless router at home that works on 2.4 Ghz, it isn't going to work while the monitor is on.The Ugly.The range and quality of reception. At a family meeting with my brothers (that also have new born children) I pulled (brand new it was it's devue) out this puppy thinking it would blow everybody away. Everyone was impressed with the size but one of my brother's graco, and my other brother's Fisher Price had much, but much better reception. They have models that are over three years old and they don't have the mind befalling hissing soud this model dose. The rage of the other monitor was better.Also I travel a lot from place to place, sometimes in place where the electric output is of 220 Volt (U.S.A has 120), and the AC adapter is not travel friendly... come on in a globalize world everything comes with a 220-120 Volt ac adapter.Verdict.. I really regret buying this. Should have done On-site research instead of relying on what people say on the web."
35606,1,"i bought this when my daughter was 3.5 months old she was too long for her infant carrier and i wanted something she could sit comfortably in when we used shopping carts. this was the perfect thing as it covers every inch the baby would come in contact, when she could not sit up yet i put her in long ways and she laid down kinda. now she can sit up and i am even more in love with this as she is now nawing on anything and everything.one poster said too bulky with a baby and trying to put it on what i do is try to park next to a cart corral and when i get out i grab the floppy put it on the cart and then take my daughter out and put her in it. much easier then you also dont have to carry her in the store so it saves the back and arms."
154485,1,"These wipes do have kind of a bad smell to them even though they are unscented. My husband can't stand it but I can deal with it. But, the wipes are a good size and they are nice and soft. The ingredient list is for the most part harmless. I don't like the fact that they contain sodium benzoate and citric acid (which can combine to form benzene). But Seventh Generation says that they've conducted testing and there is no detectable benzene in the wipes. It is so hard to find the perfect non-toxic wipe. I've tried tushies wipes. I like their ingredients but the wipes themselves are a little rough. These Seventh Generation wipes are much softer on my baby's bottom. One other thing, I put these wipes in a wipes container and the next wipe doesn't always pop out so it can be a little annoying to have to dig in the container for the next wipe. But I did re-order these wipes so in general I do like them."
63538,0,"This is a great mirror with excellent visibility for your infant's rear-facing car seat As other reviewers have said, it also has a very simple and effective attachment system, particularly if your seat has a headrest.However, you should note the obvious before buying it: the giant animal head will significantly reduce your visibility through your car's read window if you attach it in the center seat. I drive a Prius which has fairly limited visibility through the rear window to start; with this monster installed on the center headrest, I can't see out the back very well at all.I'm strongly considering decapitating my dog-themed model, but I should probably think about the potential psychological impact that this might have on my infant first..."
26993,0,"It looks like it would have been exactly what I needed, but it was way too big. I followed the recommendation of sizing and reviews that it ran small and ordered a medium, but it's huge on me. Sending it back ):"
42814,1,"So.... I read A LOT of reviews on A LOT of different wraps, slings and carriers. I was very excited when I ordered the moby... I was looking out the window every day for the UPS man. When it arrived I was thrilled... until I got it out of the box and realized how long the fabric really was!! It is LOOOOOOOONG! I mean, I had read that it was long, but I didn't know what long was until I saw it! However... after watching videos on You Tube (over and over again) and having a friend demonstrate it for me, I can say that I am thrilled with it even though I am still working out some kinks. It is comfortable (can get a bit warm) and I love the fact that I can do things around the house, take walks with my son in it (he HATES his stroller) and breastfeed in it too! I waited 8 and a half weeks to finally put it to use and I regret not putting it on from day one. It does require some practice, it doesn't fit in a diaper bag, and can be frusterating...for those reasons it gets 4 stars instead of 5."
23868,1,"This is certainly an easy answer to the swaddle/blanket/warmth dilemma. Our son is a Houdini-Baby who escapes from all swaddles except the Miracle Blanket, but he hasn't gotten out of this yet. It's super easy to use, too. I like that the zipper goes from top to bottom so the tab is away from his chin, and that we'll be able to take the swaddle off and use it as a simple sleep sack once he's outgrown being swaddled."
137363,1,"I'm 5 months pregnant and was using a king size pillow between my stomach and legs. I constantly had to move it when I rolled over, and could never get comfortable. When my husband left in the mornings, I'd take his pillow and put it behind my back so I was supported front and back.That's what this pillow does automatically, and it takes up less room. It's two sides together are about equal to the width of a king size pillow. So even though there is support in front of and behind you, you don't take up the whole bed.Now I only roll over when I wake up to go to the bathroom a couple times a night anyway. I'm sleeping great.Cons:a) it did take a few nights for me to figure out how I sleep best with it...be patientb) you are completely separated from your spouse, so you have to move the pillow out of the way for cuddling"
114319,1,This booster seat/high chair is an ingenious product. The tray is easy to take off (even with one hand) and put on. It adjusts to three different distances for the right fit. The dishwasher-safe removable tray element is also very helpful. Once the tray is no longer needed the high chair becomes a booster seat. Wonderful! And you don't have to buy yet another piece of baby furniture.
177806,1,"We needed a crib that fit a small space. We had been thinking of actually building a custom crib when we came across this crib on Amazon. We took and gamble after we read the reviews and were not disappointed. This crib is the perfect size for small spaces.The crib is a very high quality. Although the look is very simple (reminds us of cribs from the 1930s), our 9-month-old daughter seems to love the size. The mattress is firm and the support for the mattress is sturdy. The frame is very stable and doesn't rattle. The crib is deep enough that our daughter will be able to sleep in it for quite a while. However, it's shallow enough that we don't mind that fact that the sides don't lower.If you're looking for a quality crib that fits a small space (or is portable), this crib should do just fine. The first time we put our daughter in it for a nap, she slept like a baby (pardon the pun)."
2703,0,Nothing fantastic but it does mask the smell some. I really think I should just invest in a better diaper pail... But this is a cheaper option.
126845,0,"If you can buy these a Costco, do it. Otherwise, this is a fine deal--just not the best one out there."
57300,1,"the size was good, very sturdy and a great colour, my granddaughter loves it, goes with her pink room, she has had it for a couple of months"
106090,0,"I enjoyed the diaper champ until my 13 month old boy decided it was a fun to play with. He puts his toys inside the hole and flips it just like depositing a diaper. In my opinion this is a major flaw. Nothing is nastier than digging toys out of a bag of soiled diapers!Also, if a diaper is very soiled, the hole for depositing the diaper can become smeared and then when you flip the diaper into the pail the weight further smears the poo and it is difficult to clean.I combine the Champ & Genie by using the Champ for wets and the genie for poo. The combination saves money and keeps the nursery smelling fresh. I would never use the diaper champ for poopy diapers because it does not contain the smell & cleaning is close to impossible (not to mention changing out the bag and having more of the soiled diaper smell hit)!If my toddler doesn't lose interest soon I will have to abandon the Champ!!!! My hope is that he does lose interest quickly. I just wanted to bring this to other parents attention because I never thought it could be such a fascinating toy for toddlers!"
62991,0,"As my pregnant belly grew bigger, I started having problems sleeping comfortably. Decided to buy this pillow after a lot of research and hearing some glowing reviews from friends too. Thought the compact size would be perfect for me, since I'm only 5'1&#34;, and the full-size Snoogle that I found in the store just seemed too huge. (Didn't want to kick hubby out of bed!)The pillow arrived as expected, and has a cute, gender-neutral cover/pattern/print. What disappointed me was that the length seemed short -- even for me. If I stretch it out nearly completely straight and don't use the pillow under my neck, then it can cradle and support me pretty well. Otherwise, it's not long enough. (-1 star for that)I took off the other star for the .filling. I know it's a support pillow, but it's filled a little too much for my taste. Feels stiff and doesn't mold too well to my body. Even after sleeping with it every night for a couple of months, it still doesn't feel broken in.if you're looking for solid support, this is your pillow! As for me, I'll give it another month and we'll see what happens."
34410,1,"This diaper cream has worked great for my baby. It protects him very well--if he is even a bit red, a dab of this clears it right up. It also smells great and thus my daycare uses it alot too."
93041,2,"These cots have a strap sewn into the middle that doesn't stretch enough to make the cot perfectly flat to lay on. Maybe if someone was heavy enough it would stretch, but my son is as tall as the cot is and he didn't weigh enough to sleep flat. We ended up using a blow up bed for sleep and will be returning them. The picture of the 2 kids sitting at the beach is probably more what is intended for this product. Sitting, not really sleeping."
180279,2,I bought this breastpump for my first baby and it broke after I had used it three times. This pump is tricky to assemble.I called the 1-800 number and they would not believe that it broke they just kept telling me I had put it together wrong. I am not an imbecile I know the difference between broken and not put together. It had come unglued. Anyway I bought it before my son was born and so my 30 day money back guarantee was over.Trying to manual pump is nuts your hand gets tired fast and the milk comes out slowly. It was faster for me to hand express. I bought an electric pump to replace it.
75854,2,"I first bought the liners, thinking they would fit the normal bottle. After finding out they don't, I looked a lot for these specific bottles, and just found them at amazon, any other store. I could finally use my liners! The bottles are ok, not too different from the regular one."
78002,1,We have had this highchair for a year now and I cannot say enough good things about it. I recommend it to everyone. I love how slim it folds up. I love the multiple heights and reclines. We move this around two times a day and it's not showing any wear and tear. I like the material because its easy to clean- which is great for a baby! My friends have all tried different chairs from the regular low priced Graco to the FP Space Saver and they all love ours more. My kid can't get out of it when buckeled in. We have even taken it outside in the backyard for a bbq and it didn't get too hot. This is such a fabulous chair!
4359,1,"I purchased this because it said it works with Phil & Ted's Dash. I was not thrilled that the label looks blue and orange but the price seemed better and the reviews were good. When it arrived, the lettering on the top is in grey! That makes this product even better!!! It fits perfectly on my Phil and Ted's too!"
90614,0,I normally buy Costco brand diapers but since I have a good coupon for Pampers at Amazon thought I would give them a go. Fine for the day but my 17month old girl leaks in them at night. She only takes an 8 oz bottle before bed. I think I will stick with Costoc brand or Huggies for future purchases.
151265,1,This mirror is the only one I've found that works in my Nissan Rogue because the headrests are attached to the seat backs. I love that they are easily adjusted. Love them!
128846,1,"This is a great item. Quick shipping. Good quality, very ease to use, clean, the price is ok while comparing to others and it last long time if care it correctly"
96739,1,"My son recieved one of these as a shower gift and we used it frequently, I just purchsed for a friend's expectant baby. The sheep is soft and attaches securely to the crib rails. The hearbeat is a little spooky, but all other sounds soothed our son."
104635,1,"""Child Locator - Brown"" looks great. It's funny and good to have. Hopefully I'm not gonna use it."
112516,0,"These diapers work great for our child, however, I have been disappointed with the delivery. My order often stays in an ""item not yet shipped"" status for days on end even though Amazon states that they are in stock and can be delivered within a few days."
141569,2,The play panel worked for the first ten minutes and now freezes every time we turn it on. It's also not very educational as it does not repeat the vocals when the buttons are pressed. Instead either it will make a random comment or music will play. And if it is not touched within a few seconds it will start playing music. There's no chance for kids to learn cause and effect. The only part my daughter likes is to take the phone off the hook.
76596,0,"We opened the kit for the first time today when the cat got scared and ran across my husband's foot leaving a decent sized gash. I was actually kind of excited to get the kit out - especially since it was for him and not the baby (hoping to keep the baby injury free as long as possible). Thankfully everything we needed was there - an antiseptic wipe (which was almost dried out already), some ointment and a perfectly sized large bandage. But now that its open I see that it really just has a few basic things and I'm going to want to beef it up a little once our munchkin is actually mobile and more injury prone. So I'll wait until the drugstore or target has a sale on their store brand stuff and make the kit a little more complete"
54413,1,"I cannot say enough about this great mobile. They music is wonderful and the animals are the cutest things I have ever seen. Alot of parents want to buy a moblie that matches the nursery decor. My baby loves this so much more. I recommend this product to every new parent. It is battery operated so you do not have to worry about winding it up. The colors are a great addition to my baby's crib. I cannot really explain how neat it looks when it spins, you really have to see it for yourself"
24703,0,"Don't get me wrong... It's very convenient, pretty sturdy and effective gate. HOWEVER, my daughter (at 2years and 32lbs) is the ultimate problem solver and watched me go thru the gate several times the day we installed it and figured out IF she put her feet one top the other, held onto the top and hopped/jumped onthe pedal for a few moments, she could unlatch it... she may be an extreme example, but the gates that required an adult to pinch & slide or press & lift worked better for her... they required fine motor coordination than these little tikes have yet... this gate really just requires determination and energy!"
34805,1,"We purchased this car seat when our daughter reached a year and was able to be turned around. I have a 2002 Ford Escape and we looked at it when it was rear facing, but decided that we didn't like the fact that we couldn't see her over the back of the seat so we waited. This has been a great purchase! It is very easy to move in and out of cars and it fits great in my parent's Explorer and Taurus. The latch is wonderful and is a sinch to tighten. I have to say that it takes me less than 10 minutes to install-- probably closer to 5. Yes, the buckle is a bit confusing, but my sister, parents, and inlaws are all able to buckle it without problems. It's very easy to clean-- I've thrown the cover in the washing maching several times and dry it on low heat. The straps are easy to wash in the sink. We are in the market to buy a new crew cab truck and are finding it very easy to put in for test drives. We did a lot of research when we went to purchase this car seat and are VERY pleased with our decision!"
148522,1,"This is the best pillow ever! I sleep so much better with it. I know it is going to be an even bigger help the bigger I get ( I am only 5 mth. pregnant right now). I would definately recommend this to anyone, especially anyone that is expecting!!"
120461,1,"I bought this monitor when our child was 3 months old. I was so worried about SIDS and suffocation that I could barely rest. The monitor is a little more expensive than others but sooo worth it. The set up was simple. We put it in a full size crib and didn't have to adjust a thing. It worked great immediately. The sound sensor is super sharp and crystal clear. I could even hear breathing! The movement sensor is outstanding. On two occasions my baby squirmed from the sensor area and thankfully the alarm sounded...she manged to get herself under the bumper! Without the alarm I would not have known. The best thing about the monitor is that my child is now 13 months old and we still use it. It continues to work even with a pillow and blanket in the crib, as well as, a lot of strange sleeping positions in all areas of the crib. I couldn't rave about this product more. I feel so strongly that 13 months later I'm writing a review. Buy this monitor, it's a must have, and get some sleep already!"
128182,1,Amazon has them for a good price. They are so hard to find in stores! I just reccomend purchasing a big supply that way you just have to pay for shipping one time. Just make sure you don't let them dry out.
144778,2,"My daughter was an excellent sleeper when she was in her cradle...then we moved her onto this mattress in her crib. She slept terribly. She would fall asleep but she would continually wake up. After a few months I got a new mattress and she slept all night long. This mattress is the closest thing to concrete that there is. A firm mattress does not mean that the child has to sleep on rocks. I am very concerned about SIDS and researched high and low. I ended up with a much more expensive mattress that is firm yet not like concrete and it is highly recommended.The only positive thing I can say about this mattress is that because it is foam it is very easy to change sheets etc., but all foam mattresses are like that.Edit to above: As per comments...the mattress that we replaced this on with was the moonlight slumber mattress."
132146,1,I love the diaper bag. It's a beautiful lilac/purple shade. My little girls nursery is a blend of purple shades and I was so happy to find this diaper bag. I was slightly concerned about the corduroy material looking too wintery but not at all. It's perfect.
31175,2,"After typing this review, I am going to spend the next 30 minutes trying to get blood out of my carpet. My 6 year old somehow toppled this gate and ended up with a bloody nose - it's a remarkably heavy gate. Yesterday we installed the gate, and it fell on my 3 year old as she tried to ""pull up"" the door to open it (which is required in order to swing open the door). Thank goodness it didn't fall on my 10 month old! We chose this gate because we needed something our two other children could open and close. Not only could my 3 not open it (it was too complicated), I had trouble lifting the door - it usually took two hands.... So, after cleaning up the blood on the carpet, I'll be throwing this hunk of junk back into the box to return to the store tomorrow."
163310,1,"This changing pad is long enough to hold any sized diaper aged child, handy pocket and zipper to hold wipes and ointments plus it all folds up like a neat pocketbook."
101932,1,gott his for my 4 month old as a gift hope she like it it came quick and its for christmas
89405,1,"Nice product, could be a little softer and less stiff. (I love Cruisers) Holds up overnight and seems comfy. But the price never stays the same! The price was 39.99 for baby dry size 5 172 count and now it is 35.75 after refreshing the page? It keeps changing constantly! From 37 to 39 back down to 35! Now if it stays at 35 that would be pretty awesome but I somehow doubt it will and it will probably raise back up before I even have to purchase them.Side note that may help people with leaking problems, make sure the leg ruffles stay on the outside of the diaper and aren't inside or else you will have massive leakage. Not enough absorbancy? Move up a size! :) I can literally use any diaper during the day without leakage as long as I don't keep the leg ruffles inside the diaper. I also take the leak guards on the inside of the diaper and pull them out a little so that they aren't all scrunched up anymore. (if that makes sense, haha) I just choose pampers because I like them the best. :)"
134691,2,"We bought this toy when our daughter was 4 months old. She grew with it...loved the music, which is why we bought this particular model. However, we soon found that once the battery ran out on the music toy, it couldn't be replaced. That part of the exersaucer became useless. We've since had another baby. He never got to use the music part of the toy. We took it down after one month of use because of boredom. The plastic toys are cheap and boring. Since the only part that was good about this toy was the music, it's a waste of time and money because you can't replace the battery."
157622,1,Great cheap sippy that can be washed and reused even though made to be used and tossed. Love the environment ...wash and reuse!
80392,2,"I purchased this item for my baby's bathtimes thinking it would be safe and fun. It has such a strong smell (the rubber/plastic/vinyl/whatever) that I had to leave it in the garage for 4 months before I could stand to bring it in the house. And, it's so stiff, I can't fit it on the faucet. I don't know what to do with it now."
126665,1,I loved this diaper pack and the price was a major plus! I will definitely go through amazon for my diapers again.
87794,0,Neither of our babies were particularly impressed with this.About 5 - 10 minutes was all they could stand and then they were crying for attention.
162930,1,Arrived within a week of ordering. Looks very nice. Fairly easy to put together. Matches the DaVinci Emily cherry converter crib that we also ordered. The price was reasonable and the shipping was free.
19736,1,The bottle warmer is a must have for new moms. It's such a pain to heat a bottle in boiling water - and it takes so long. This bottle warmer will heat your bottle in 1-2 minutes -- it's quick and easy. The product has held up nicely and doesn't take up too much counter space.
91539,0,"I get a lot of static if I have the receivers too close together, we have a small one-story house so I can hear the baby from pretty much anywhere, but I like to use them when I am watching tv, doing dishes, vacuum, etc... and I can't there is just too much static and they work worse when they are plugged in, one receiver won't even work right unless the plug is tilted a certain way. However they work GREAT when I am outside or when baby is at grandmas where there are 2 floors. Overall, not a bad deal for the price."
56249,1,"I have used this monitor for 2 years of my daughters life. The first year it worked pretty good, I could see if she was lieing down, playing, or standing with a little static. Now it is 2 years old and it shows more static, but I can still see if she is lieing down, playing, or standing. I recommend this for the parnet that wants to see their child and not just hear.I just wish it had a record button, becuase watching her play alone was soooo cute."
70079,2,"I would not recommend this monitor because the batteries have to be changed every other day. Also, the battery compartment is very difficult to open and close."
111000,1,"Why I never thought to get this as a baby shower gift is beyond me. I first decided that I would need this product for Disney World. I wanted something light colored so it would not absorb the Florida heat and make it unbearable for my son. This design Chateau Silver was classy, unisex, light and very, very comfortable in the hot humid weather of Disney World. It was easy to put on, simply hang the entire cover over your neck and you are good to go. He couldn't yank it off, he couldn't kick it away. Perfect! I was very relaxed and comfortable enough to nurse him with my feet folded on any chair or bench for support, even wearing a skirt, and not worrying that I might show off more than I desired. Don't let the image on the page here fool you, the cover was generous in length and breadth, enough for myself and the tyke, and I am a size 14!Clean up was very easy, just throw in the wash and the curved stiff collar came out just fine even through the dryer, no ironing or starching business. I did use gentle fabric wash just in case, I love the design so very much!If there's one thing I didn't use it was the side pockets. The good thing about those is that it is terry cloth and weighed the entire cover down enough to not get windblown after catching a gust or two. Neat! All in all, if I had one word to describe this item, I would deem it a Lifesaver. You there, public nursing mother struggling with a blanket, get this item!!! Worth every penny, and after the breastfeeding stage, also great for them to take naps in your arms. Or to use as a stroller cover. The possibilities are endless!"
67169,0,"Having a double/triple stroller is great but it is big barely fits in the back of my Mini-Van. It has a huge storage basket on the bottom but it is hard to get anything in or out of it. It doesn't come with a cup holder for parents. I think there should be shoulder straps on the sit and stand seat, if the child wants out of the seat they can get out easily. But for the price you really can't beat it."
36411,1,"I am 18 weeks pregnant. I bought this product because I knew I'd need to switch from being a stomach-sleeper to a side-sleeper, and sleeping on my side usually isn't comfortable for me because my knee bones rub against each other. The pillow helps a great deal with this, and I imagine that I'll still use it for a long time after the pregnancy.A good purchase. Definitely worth the money."
169752,1,"Very good quality, very sturdy... a little confusing to assemble but apart from that a Great product!"
135885,1,"My baby was primarily nursed until 6 months of age and I couldn't get him to take any kind of bottle when we decided to put him in daycare. I tried Avent and the Playtex nurser and it seemed to make him gag, he really took to the Dr Brown's bottles since the nipple is a lot softer and shorter then most nipples. This is the only bottle that my breastfed baby took!!!!"
36242,2,"We received this item as a gift. I would agree with the other reviewers that this item is even better looking in real life than online. However, the clear lid on this is made of plastic. Unfortunately, the plastic was cracked when we received it. Since we liked it so much, we sent out for a replacement. The replacement had the same problem. We were going to give it one more try, however were told this was a widespread problem and they couldn't send us another but rather had to give us store credit. In summary, lucky you if you receive a non-defective item -- you will be pleased with your purchase. On the other hand, if you aren't so lucky, have fun getting the issue resolved. It has been a month and we still haven't gotten our store credit."
79334,1,"The baby loves the animals on the mobile. We mixed and matched it with the Mawali set so we could get pieces that don't exist in both. The only downside is how cheaply made these items are. The sheet is thin and not very soft. The first day we set it up, one of the ties fell off the bumper, a month later, a second one fell off. Two and a half months after setting it up, the hook that holds the musical disc to the mobile broke. My son loves the set so much, that we bought a chaper mobile and replaced that part. A generation before us would have been appauled, but that's just the quality of todays products. Hooray for outsourcing."
180851,1,"Bought this for my 3 month old granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it! It has lots of danglies to look at and detach for holding, lights and music. Glad I purchased the Deluxe model, well worth the price."
106214,1,"We did a lot of research before buying a diaper pail. So, of course we noticed that the Diaper Champ has a much higher user rating than the Diaper Genie. It works great! We never smelled a dirty diaper pail until my dd was like 9 months old, at which point it doesn't matter what kind of pail you have, it stinks! Those solid foods do amazing things.Buy this! Not the Diaper Genie. Save yourself the hassle and money."
70651,1,"My baby is only 5 mo's so we haven't used the rocker yet but he's loved this since we 1st put him in it. The hanging pig was the 1st thing he tried touching when he started having some control of his arms. He tried hard at 1st to touch the pig, now he has both hands (& legs) swinging all over the place, pulling the cow for the song, etc... Its been fun watching him advance in it! We also like removing the animals to hang in front of him for tummy-time (anything to amuse him since he hates tummy time). Since the animals are velcroed on, they can easily be switched around. I'd definetely recommend this seat. Hopefully your child will enjoy it as much as ours does."
55093,1,"If you need an easy to steer, easy to push, easy to fold double stroller, then go for it.After reading most of the reviews on most of the double strollers, I came to the conclusion that this is the most convenient double stroller.You can use this stroller for long walks and can push it with one hand. I've had mine for 2 years, use it for groceries, use it to go for walks, even used it as a bassinet when baby was born.This stroller will ride easily on any type of terrain beside for the sand on the beach. I have even used it on grass (pushes very easily) and sand (a pain if you have 2 kids in it)Another advantage of this stroller is that if you have 3 little kids, the older one can stand or sit next to the baby in the back sit and put their feet on the footrest.You do have to take off the tray if you want the stroller to fit in a regular sedan trunk, but it takes one second to do that, plus it leaves lots of room for groceries.My only wish, that graco would make adaptable jogging wheels on this stroller to make it even more versatile!"
116256,2,"I was excited to try this organic towel for my newborn. Unfortunately, a 3"" portion of the seam came apart after the first wash. We still use the towel as a back-up, but it's definitely poor quality for the price."
84684,1,My bottle tops got broken one way or another so these were a perfect replacement instead of buying brand new bottles.
142543,2,"These chairs are labeled wrong on Amazon and are not shipped correctly. I ordered these chairs 3 months ago and recieved a toy train instead. I called Amazon to return the toy train and they promptly shipped me another toy train! So far I have received 3 toy trains and not a single chair. Their is a problem within Amazon or Target where the items or item numbers are mixed up. You will not receive these chairs. But if you want a toy train that your kid can sit on...go ahead and order these chairs. I do not know who has the mix-up but I described it at length with Amazon who said they would have it fixed.....but alas, another toy train. I now have received a full refund."
141431,1,"This Walker is great, our daughter really enjoyed it. She walked all over with it & loved all the farm animals ,especially the barn door. The front comes off & can come off to go with for long car trips to keep your toddler occupied. Great entertainment value & is great for learning hand eye coordination. Our Daughter is 14 months & still plays with it. Buy It."
66118,1,"These bottles do actually almost eliminate the air infants take in when nursing. I noticed an immediate improvement with gassiness, fussiness and reflux symptoms with my twins. We have exclusively used them from 6 weeks to nine months with no complaints whatsoever...not even any leaking. If you have tried everything, use these. If you can avoid wasting your money trying anything else, try these first."
109677,0,"I just got this car seat and love how soft and pretty the seat is. I washed the padding for my daughter is born but feeding the straps back through is a complete nightmare. it took 30 mins the first time then i realized it was back wards and to repeat it and the 2nd time took 20 mins, then after those 2 times i realized i forgot to put the head rest on, and another 20 mins trying to feed the straps through. i hope this seat works well, my sister has it and loves it. everything about it is wonderful except when you want to clean the seats padding."
60729,2,"I thought that the diaper genie was the greatest to begin with. Poopie sausages, great. Now that my daughter is 16 months old the diaper genie is going to be replaced with something, anything would be better. I change the bag about every other day and let it sit outside opened for about 4 hours every week and wash /lysol every time I change take a &quot;poopie sausage&quot; out and yep, it still smells every time I open the lid. I spray lysol on top of the closed bags!!! Believe me, I have tried everything to make this work. For the first 12 months it wonderful, now it just stinks."
50810,1,"I am 32 weeks, and have been having a very difficult time sleeping. I was constantly waking up with hip, leg, and back pain, finding it much more comfortable to sleep on the couch. I broke down and bought the snoogle about 2 weeks ago, and I am so glad I did. It still isn't a perfect nights rest, but I am sleeping MUCH more comfortably.PROS-I love the back support!! It has made a world of difference.-Absolutely NO MORE hip and leg pain with this pillow. It is amazing!!-Can also be used for breastfeeding support in bed after the baby is born. I'll keep you posted on how that turns out.CONS-Kind of pricey. I felt bad spending $50 on a pillow. Still, sleep is worth it in my opinion.-Some stated is was bulky. I didn't find that to be a problem, but I do have to get out of bed to turn it over (to switch from side to side). This hasn't been a problem for me though since I am getting up to pee every 2 hours throughout the night.I hope it works for you as well as it has for me!! Sweet dreams :-)."
5681,1,The Animal Antics Crib Set is beautiful and the colors are great. It washed nicely. The different animals are made of a chenille material and they are adorable! I am very pleased with this purchase.
161907,2,"My baby is now 8 months old and we have decided to give up the hassle of using this bathtub. First, it leaks through the division in the middle. At the beginning it wasn't everyday but a few weeks ago we had to bathe our baby girl quickly so we wouldn't loose the water. Second, the cloth in the bouncer-like baby holder is supposed to be mildew proof..Not! I have even tried drying it by sunlight and it still smelled weird. You have to wash it every couple of days. Third, I would put the tub upside down resting on the bathtub and I would still find yellow mildew through the cracks and underneath the sitting attachment. Fourth, the sitting attachment would not work for my baby girl. It makes them sit too tightly and I couldn't reach her very well to bathe her."
66340,1,I just purchased this infant carrier. I had a different one for my first baby. I'm 5ft and my other carrier had the straps on the shoulders. I always felt like they were going to slide off my arm. This carrier is so secure because of the strap going around your neck and one around your back. It makes the baby and me so secure. I wish they had this one with my first born. I love it!
46752,2,well if i could give it negative stars i would but i cant! do yourself a favor do not buy this swing even if its the last one on earth and they offer to give you money. its that bad! this P.O.S. started to break 3 days after use and by the end of the week it had stopped working all together. The motors that operate the swing arent stong enough or suffer from defect. We ended up with the fisher Price swing and are happy thus far.
107317,1,"We've used our Diaper Champ for almost three years now, with good success. I love that it uses basic cheap kitchen trash bags, and that it is so user-friendly (Diaper Genie at the pediatrician's office is too difficult to figure out). We keep odors under control two ways: first, we dump the poop into the potty, which is now an integral part of our potty training regimen; second, every time we take out the bag, which is twice a week, I spray the insides with Lysol and then leave the lid open over night. No smelly odors! Just for kicks, I've washed it out with Clorox in the bathtub once or twice, but I don't really know if that was necessary or not."
151034,2,"I bought this changing table when my daughter was born (1/06). It matched the Aspen cherry crib that we'd bought and were very happy with. However, the drawer on this changing table hasn't opened or shut smoothly since my daughter was about 2 months old. It quickly began to fall off the track and was more trouble than it was worth. We dumped it when my son was born and are glad to be free of the aggravation."
5703,1,"I can't believe how inexpensive these were. Now I don't have to worry about kids coming over and electrocuting themselves. Even if you don't have kids but you have young children over regularly, you should install these throughout your house."
8816,1,"I love this portable booster. I bought it for our 18 month old son and it makes meals so much more enjoyable. Certainly feeding is more of a mess because he can spread it accross the table. :) What is also nice is that it is portable, durable and sticks to all surfaces. I was concerned the plastic one's would slip around too much..Highly reccommend this...."
7520,0,"Once I recieved the carrier the first thing I noticed was that is was navy blue. The picture that I looked at seem to me to be black. When I called the Baby Trend company they informed me that they could not garentee that I would recieve a black one even if I sent it back. Being color isn't everything, I was still excied because it's light weight and easy to move baby, I started to put it together. My husband is in the military and is not around to help me put things together right now, so being 33 weeks pregnant I still havn't been able to get our Snug Ride car seat to snap on. This may be do to my own errors but I don't really have much of a choice but to send it back if I want to have a stroller for when our baby arrives."
122287,2,"While it has the motor power and a good size cup to hold the food, it has some really frustrating design flaws. As I type this, I can't open the top to remove the food that I just blended! The lid frequnetly gets stuck onto the cup. And, the motor fits onto the base by this tiny little button that you have to perfectly align to get the thing to work. Soooo annoying!"
113436,1,"very good. Worth every money. Really. Our one and half yrs old Leonard love it very much. We use this in Poland (Europe) and during our vacations trips. The seat was privately imported from USA, because in our country and in most of european countries this is not available..."
79742,0,I bought another video monitor first and it was bad. Static for both video and sound.It turns out it was not a good fit for my house but it worked great for a town house so ended up getting this one. I've had no issue with it other than the battery dying too fast. It won't hold through the nigh so I have to keep it plugged in. Other than that I'm pretty happy with it.
27350,2,"I have washed this cover about four times and the waterproof liner has already ripped. On the plus side, it fits the Chicco Lullaby LX Playard, it is soft and my baby seems comfortable on it."
152781,1,"I am pregnant now with our second child and the old car seat we have for our two and a half year old is a hand-me-down that has just been used for too long now. Not only is it too heavy to change from car to car, it is very large in size. My husband and I were looking at the Eddie Bauer car seat but found that the evenflo booster was much cheaper and simpler. The seat is very light weight and has a lot of padding. I love the cup holders too! I thought the back was a bit flimsy but really it is just a way it is made able to recline a little. If you just pull the seat out a little the car seat can recline so the kids can fall aslepp. The lights on the sides are also a plus, my son absolutly loves his new big boy seat! I would recommend this seat to any mom or dad looking for simplicty and comfort!"
21270,1,"Very pretty stroller, smooth ride. I am not sure if this stroller is worth the $$$ paid for it. It is not made all THAT great. The tray is flimsy, the tires are not made of real rubber...only plastic. They could have done a better job."
27013,1,"Just got the item today in a size medium and am very happy with my purchase. I wish I would have bought it sooner. Very Comfy and supportive. I was unsure whether to buy a size small or medium but ended up getting a medium and am happy I did. It fits well and has room for me to grow. I also received the item within 3 days of ordering which was great. Great item, great price!"
74292,1,This was a gift and I am told that they love it. They are both sitting in it right now on Facebook!
127366,0,"First the good. The crib is beautiful and it's very sturdy. The wood is great and I do love it. It is a little difficult for me because I'm short and the front doesn't go down, but I also like it for the same reason. There are no moveable parts to pinch little fingers. I like how the whole crib doesn't move when my daughter jumps up and down.But, the finish is terrible. It scratches extreamly easily and there are teeth marks all up and down the rails. I scratched it on accident with just my fingernail. We are going to have to refinish it when my daughter is older."
154098,0,"The package size makes them very convenient for carrying in my diaper bag or purse. The re-sealable sticker actually sticks, which is a plus! The wipes themselves are a little on the flimsy side, in my opinion; they were fine for wet diaper changes, but poopy diapers required using a few more than usual. I will buy them again based on convenience and price; also, my daughters both have really sensitive skin, and I feel like these wipes were really gentle for them."
28422,1,"One of the best purchases as being a new mom, it helps soothe the baby and rock her to sleep!! It also helps me relax."
176793,1,"We have a two-story house, and this saves me from having to run downstairs in the middle of the night to heat a bottle. I use the wide Avent bottles, and this accomodates them, which is another plus. Only thing is--depending on how much liquid is in the bottle, you will have to &quot;tweak&quot; the amount of water you pour into the chamber to get the bottle the right temperature. This may take a couple tries, but it's not difficult. It does take a while to heat the bottle, but I usually change baby's diaper while it's heating and by the time I'm done with that, the bottle is ready."
66185,1,"I did a lot of research online for bottles with our 2nd child. I wanted to see what was new and different since my 1st child. I read the reviews on this highly acclaimed product, and I must say I am pleasantly pleased. My child spit up quite a bit and had an awful time with gas, but after switching to Dr Johns the spitting up has diminished. Although, he still does have a problem with gas. The washing of the bottles was cumbersome at first, but you get down to a routine after the first couple of days."
167403,0,I ordered this box for a gift but after receiving it i was very disappointed. The bags were great but the box was crushed and falling apart. I wish I would have that the product had a defect.
68709,2,These wipes clean well.They arrived promptly.They stink something fierce.I cannot stand the way they smell.
79240,1,"California Baby is effective in healing and preventing diaper rash as it contains zinc oxide like Desitin. But it doesn't stink like fish oil. It uses lanolin and calendula for healing and tea tree oil, which has antibacterial and antifungal properties. And it makes my baby (and my hands) smell WONDERFUL, of soothing lavender and sage. Unlike Desitin which is thick and sticky (hard to wipe off), California Baby is light and foamy. It is not greasy and wipes/rinses off easily. It is also safe for cloth diapers, unlike Desitin or even Grandma El's (which uses petrolium jelly). I love it.The only problem is that when it gets toward the end (the last third), you'll be squeezing, squeezing, trying to get it out... and it will spurt out suddenly and go flying. Keep an extra cloth nearby for cleanup."
42387,1,"I love this wrap. I ordered it when I first got pregnant, and practiced putting it on and off before my belly got in the way. Then when baby got here, we were ready to go. Its a little bulky/hot in the florida summer, but I love how close it holds the baby in. :D."
117525,2,"Our little girl enjoys herself while in this jumper, but the chord is too long. There are no instructions on how to shorten it, and as far as we can tell, it's already as short as it can go. Her legs are already bent while just sitting in it, so when gravity pulls her further down when she's jumping in it, I get nervous that she'll bang her knee(s) on the floor."
77657,1,Fold flat and surprisingly light. The handles look industrial - which I like because that translates into a very sturdy hold. Looking forward to bringing along for a cross-country beach trip...may need to get another for the other car.
11932,1,"We love our Baby Safe Feeder! I put frozen strawberries in it when she is teething and it works miracles. Anything that makes my girl feel better when she is teething is worth a million bucks to me, and I love the security and peace of mind we get from it. And having a baby girl that smells like fresh strawberries is pretty cool too! Beyond the teething aspect, it's a great way to expose your baby to flavors and textures you would otherwise have to avoid for safety reasons. As a new mom I am paranoid enough- having one less thing to worry about is priceless. Get TWO!!"
13403,1,"I really like this stool. It's sturdy and well-build. Only complaint is that it could be a little wider for me. I like to keep my feet apart somewhat when I nurse.Amusingly, my toddler thinks this is his ""chair"" and uses it when we read books before bed time."
176565,1,"Okay - I was one of those new moms who had no clue about which bottles of the many types to use for my baby. I read all of the online reviews and decided I would get a couple of each type and try them all. I have the Avent bottles, Dr. Brown's, Gerber, you name it, I have a ton of them.I exclusively breatfeed my baby and everyday he gets a bottle with his medicine in it along with the bottles I pump for when we will be somewhere that's difficult to breastfeed. In my opinion, this system is HANDS-DOWN THE BEST.Here's what I like:The liners are sterile so you can always be sure your baby is drinking out of a clean bottle.Nothing to wash but the nipple and ring. Its so quick and easy, especially when you are in a hurry or in the middle of the night when its harder to think straight. When he's done, just toss the drop in and wash the nipple and you are ready for your next bottle.My baby didn't struggle with swallowing air using this bottle like the others I tried because you push the air out. It worked much better for him than the Dr. Brown's bottles. Using these, he didn't struggle with gas pains afterwards.He switched with no problems from a very early age between the breast and this bottle type. It comes with various nipples to try and the breastfeeding nipple works great for him.Here is the only downside:You cannot pump directly into the liners - but that is not a big deal to me. I pump into the Medela CSF bags and store those. When I am ready to make a bottle, I pour it out of the CSF bag and into the liner. It became routine and its not a problem for me to take that extra step.Good luck in making your choices about bottles for your baby but from a new mom whose tried them all, these really are the best all around."
50488,1,"I am thirteen weeks and a stomach sleeper. I was having a hard time sleeping on my side, but with the addition of this pillow I am sleeping SO WELL. I would highly suggest getting this pillow if you are not ordinarily a side sleeper. Sure it is expensive, but isn't a good night's sleep priceless?"
34376,1,"Our daughters rashes disappear between diaper changes and definitley by morning if used the night before. She's had zero adverse reactions. We've used it on other rashes (under her neck) and even on severe dry skin this winter; what ever the condition, it clears up with one application. It became our routine to use it on problem areas (fat rolls) after baths and she's never had a rash in those areas since.We recieved the first tube as a baby gift and were unable to find it locally...thanks Amazon for coming through yet again."
93917,1,"I was initially a little nervous when I ordered the table because it was so inexpensive. When it arrived 3 days after I ordered it, I was blown away by the solid wood quality. My kids love the table and it is the best deal I have found in quite a while. You get a solid wood table for a wood veneer price. The shipping was super fast and cheap. I also ordered a clamp on paper roll center so they could color on it just like the one at pottery barn for $300!! If you are looking for a quality activity table this is definitely it!"
127413,1,"The Davinci crib has good craftman ship, love the color, like how it converted to a bed.easy to put together,"
39886,1,"We got this as a baby shower gift and are really enjoying it. I used it while I pregnant to help me relax and go to sleep, we used it in the delivery room the same way, and we have used it to calm our son and help him sleep literally since day one when we were still in the hospital. He loves it, and it is a dream at nap time!"
12848,2,"It doesn't work. I am 25 weeks right now, know where he is and I still can't hear his heartbeat. It's such a disappointment! Lucky for me, I didn't have to pay for it..."
32165,1,I looked all over for baskets until I came across these.I considered buying the more expensive version but I am glad I didn't. They are very big and fit perfect on my changing table. I use them to hold bibs and blankets. I am very pleased with them!!
127519,1,I read a lot of reviews on this product on how it scratches easily and how the directions are hard to follow. This item is wonderful!!! Putting mine together took about an hour by myself and not one little dent occurred or scratch. Now the directions on the other hand were not so good as everyone says. But if you follow the pictures for the most part you will do fine. It looks great in the baby room and matches the Badger Basket Company Sleigh Style Changing Table with Hamper/3 Baskets in Cherry that we also bought. Not a perfect match but really close. I would suggest to anyone to buy this crib it is wonderful and sturdy.
55515,2,Pretty unsatisfactory product. Arrived very quickly. Doesn't heat a bottle any faster than running the bottle under hot running water. My nanny has simply refused to use it.
33104,0,"I haven't used these shells, but I wanted to let mothers out there know that I found a product online available only from a few places, called Avent Niplette. When I had my son, I had so much trouble breastfeeding him because my nipples were flat. Sadly, I gave up after a few days. I was envious of other mothers who could easily breastfeed their little ones. I couldn't imagine going out in public with a screaming baby and spending ten minutes each feeding trying to help him latch on. I went online and found this Avent Niplette that is supposed to permanently correct flat and inverted nipples in about three months. It costs about $50 but I think it's worth it to be able to breastfeed a baby with &quot;normal&quot; nipples. If you have this same problem I suggest you look into it. You can find it at the Avent website. It's best to use it before getting pregnant but you can still use it while you're pregnant. I'm going to get them so when I have more children I'll be ready to breastfeed!!"
4519,0,When I saw this online I HAD to have it. My fifteen month old is ALWAYS grabbing at my spoon or fork and screams until I give it to him. This provided me with a way to teach him how in a relatively clean and safe way. I do have to say that the idea is better than the actual product. The suction does not work very well and comes right up. It is a cute idea but not quite great quality. Save your money.
32341,2,I purchased these pads to replace the babies r us brand ones when I ran out. My daughter loves to kick her legs when being changed and these pads are so flimsy that they would crumple up and rip. Not worth the money.
18034,1,We got this play gym when our daugther was born from her grandparents and the moment she laid in it she fell in love. The star plays classical musics and lights up. You can put it on motion option which allows the musics and light to play when it detects movements. The play gym helped our daughter learn to kick at an early age and at 2 months old she could follow the Peditrican's flashlight at her check ups. The are 3 hanging toys which you can adjust length with link-a-doos. There is also and mirror and a boppy pillow that babies love to use. Our baby loves falling asleep under the gym during the day. Worth the money and a great baby shower gift. My baby is almost 7 months old and she still loves playing on it. She can sit up and roll so there are more things she can do with it.
67087,1,"I bought this bed for my 3 year for her birthday. She was sooo excited she crawled straight in it and all the other kids at her party played around her while she lay in her new bed:) She even threw herself in the floor crying when my husband had to take it apart to get it into her bedroom!! I was a little worried because of some of the reviews, in my opinion, it is adorable and very sturdy, and I would call it pink rather than purple-there must have been a bad run of them at some point?? She has slept in it every night since her party with NO complaints!"
132936,1,"I chose the Diaper Dekor because it looks like a regular trash can. After we're out of diapers, I can keep the Dekor for the bathroom trash. It's easy to use, and tying off the bags is pretty simple. I don't use the pedal to open the lid because it's on carpet. But I'd bet it works fine on flat flooring."
44557,1,"We purchased this gate to span an opening near the bottom of our stairs and it works very well. We have had this gate in place since my son started crawling and he has yet to breech the perimeter. My husband installed it easily (one end into a stud in the wall, one end into an oak stair banister) and it is sturdy - even with my son frequently shaking it in the middle, it has shown no signs of dislodging.I give it 4 stars out of 5 because it is not very attractive and the opening mechanism is somewhat cumbersome (and tough for guests to figure out). But it definitely does its job and I would recommend this gate to anyone with a long span to cover."
2829,1,"The Boppy is a great tool for new moms and babies. I used it for breastfeeding - it works really well for this since it wraps around your waist so you can breastfeed in a number of different positions easily. The Deluxe Boppy is a bit fluffier and softer (with a washable fleece cover) which is also a plus. The best use for the Boppy was as a ""baby holder."" We would swaddle our son in a receiving blanket and then position him like a peg in a doughnut hole. This was perfect for keeping him in a safe sleeping position (though the manufacturer advises against this) and he liked being at a slightly inclined level when he was waking up. A great addition to any baby nursery!"
99292,0,"It's not a bad diaper, but it does absorb a lot less than the Cruisers. My son drinks a lot of fluid, and therefore also pees quite a bit. The Baby Dry needs to be changed out more often to avoid leaks than the Cruisers, but it is a bit cheaper. However, I really don't think the tiny little price savings is worth it considering the extra effort and the extra cost of using more diapers."
168134,1,"There are definitely cheaper diapers out there, but this is the best diaper you'll ever buy. It stops leaks and poopy diapers like no other diaper. The mesh lining keeps everything away from the baby's skin."
66356,1,"I have purchased several pairs of monkey toe shoes for my grandchildren in the past few years. They are wonderful! A good quality and the kids love them and the grandchildren are just crazy about them. People/strangers are forever asking, ""where did you get those shoes?""My whole family loves Monkey Toes!"
183742,0,"I like the overall appearance of the backpack.I like the space, the easy access front zipper and the sturdy shoulder strap but the bottle cooler can hold only 2 bottles.My baby wants to always have a cold drink wherever we go so I need extra space for it. I end up putting a small handy cooler for the extra bottle inside the backpack together with the diapers and shirts. So because of that all the contents in it gets wet."
49609,1,This was truly a needed item in my home. I have twin boys and put it off for a while. It is a great purchase. I have two sets of stairs and this set my mind at ease. I also got the extension.
105481,1,"I agree with many that this is a great product. Up until we started table food, it kept all of the diaper smell contained. We still use it for urine only diapers, and it is great.I have heard that the diaper genie does a better job with keeping the toddler diapers contained. But at what cost? In our house we just take the bm diapers straight to the outside trash. We keep a large paper bag from the grocery store to contain them in our larger trash can. (Per our garbage man's request, he was having to get them out by hand before then because they would get stuck.)"
177054,0,"We have a wide opening between our living and dining rooms. It certainly keeps our one and two year old children out of the dining/kitchen area. The problem I've had is that there is a one inch square bar that you step over when you open the swing gate. I was carring my little daughter into the dining area from the living area and my foot cought the bar. We went flying fortunately I was able to push away from the table so my daughter didn't get rammed into the table. I ,however,injured my knee badly and have to have surgery to repair my muniscus and I have a torn pcl that surgery isn't an option for. BE CAREFUL if you decide to go ahead with it. Tell guest in your home to also watch their step. People are too sue happy today."
2124,1,The diapers work better than Huggies or Luvs for our boys. Will continue to buy Pampers. Pampers also controls smells better than some other off brand diapers we have tried.
179269,2,"didn't help with gas, a pain to clean and they leaked. The old fashioned plastic bottle with a plain nipple worked best for us."
143902,1,"These are well made with ties to secure the tops to the head rest and an elastic to go around the seat. The reason I didn't give them five stars is simply because they are slightly smaller than the seats themselves, and since my daughter still sits in the middle of the back seat, she was still dirtying the little bit of exposed upholstery on the side edges of both back seats. I remedied this problem by running to AC Moore and purchasing some upholstery twist pins. I shifted the seat back protectors where I wanted them to be and the twist pins are holding them in place. I am sure that some people would not want to go through this trouble, but I was eager to make these work for me, especially since I didn't want to go one more day with my daughters shoes on the seats!"
65242,1,"My husband had to buy this extension to fit the gate we purchased at Babies-R-Us. We have a large opening in our kitchen and it fits perfect. It looks so much nicer then wooden gates we've had in the past. The gate closes by itself after you enter, and our 2 year old can't open it without us. We bought this to keep our dogs locked in our kitchen when we leave our house, and our cattle dog won't attempt to jump it. I wrote this review mainly to reassure you that the bottom of the gate is not a problem when walking through the gate. Our family of four has now had the gate for 5 months and no one has tripped over it, even my 2 year old! I know that this was my biggest concern when buying the gate, but I didn't see any reviews that talked about it. I hope this helps you!"
76084,0,"I marked these (3) stars for two reasons1. If you don't WAY overfill each cube, two cubes equal about 1.3oz not the advertised 1 each. Measured by pureeing a veggie or fruit than letting it melt in a Green Sprout storage container. Just an FYI but I didn't like finding out later on I wasn't feeding my baby the amount I thought.2. Lids fit only so-so.Other than that been decent ice/baby food trays easy to get the items out."
87990,1,"My little Sarah 3 months old loves this gym. She lays there and coo and laughs at it all the time. She has just discovered that she can reach up a grab each item. If I place the toys lower, than she can chew on them. She had provided hours of entertainment for me and her daddy"
114143,1,"Ordered for my 1yr old. This is easy to use, clean and tote. I am very please with my purchase."
24763,1,"I used this gate to keep my 40 lb. Shepard mix puppy confined to his room during the night. It was the perfect choice with the walk though gate, as obviously, lifting the dog over wasn't going to be an option. It was quite strong, holding his weight from his front paws until he weighed about 65-70 lbs. Now I use it when my 12 mo. old nephew comes to visit. As for the construction, the gate took heavy use and hasn't fallen apart yet. The best thing is that it was very kind on my door jams, leaving only very slight marks."
113100,1,"Bought 2 of these, this is the best I have found :)"
168979,1,"Great value and in my opinion, the best diapers out there!! Super soft and comfy for little behinds - my son doesn't like any other diaper (we've tried many)! And we go through quite a bit!"
183971,0,Luvs diapers are really good diapers for all the people. It is even economical which is most important to a parent. Quality of the diaper is also good. Finally it is a good product from amazon. Thanks to amazon
50776,1,"I bought a Snoogle at about 5 months pregnant because I could no longer stand the terrible lower back pain I was waking up with night after night. After using it for a couple of weeks, these are the big issues I've had:1) The material and filling feel cheaper than you'd expect for the price. It's not nearly as nice to put my head on as my regular pillow.2) It gets quite hot. If I try to sleep with this plus a sheet and blanket I wake up covered in sweat, even though it's the middle of winter. I'd have to imagine it's even more uncomfortable during the summer.3) It's very bulky and awkward, especially when you have to get up to pee 3+ times a night. And you can forget about going to sleep snuggled with your partner!4) The straight back portion doesn't do a great job of conforming to my body, so it doesn't always give support where I need it. Pulling it tight under my head and between my legs helps, but I find myself having to readjust frequently.With all of that aside, I'm still glad I bought it - my back pain isn't totally gone but it's nowhere near as bad as it used to be, and that alone makes it worth it to me."
4650,0,I bought these as I wanted chlorine free diapers. They are soft but I find they leak when I use them overnight. I have no problem with either Luvs or Pampers for overnight use so now I just use these during the day.
11769,1,"This is a wonderful way to introduce your baby to &quot;table&quot; foods. The first day I bought this I put some melon in the feeder for my 8 month old daughter and she loved it. She's been teething for months now (already has 8 teeth), and this is a wonderful way to let her chew on healthy snacks. You can put fruits, veggies, biscuits and even cooked meat (though I haven't yet) in the feeder. It saves me a lot of worry about her choking on supposedly safe foods for infants. Anyway, I highly recommend this product (you will need extra bags). My mother was so impressed with this feeder and how much my daughter enjoyed it, she went out and bought one for when my daughter visits Grandma and Grandpa."
104013,1,"After much research, a while back I bought an Avent manual pump. It was a great product, comfortable, easy to use. But for returning to work I wanted something that would work a lot faster, with equal or greater production. It also had to be a good quality product and easy to use.The IQ Duo does all that. I've heard some of the other pumps out there...you'd think someone fired up a generator. The Duo is compact and quiet. Plus, the attachments are very similar to the manual pump, some parts are interchangeable. It assembles and breaks down quickly.This pump is a must have for anybody trying to feed a baby and hold down a job. If you pump on any regular basis, spend the money and you will be glad you did.(p.s. the Amazon price of $220 is a really good deal.)"
125694,0,"This product came to me defective but despite this problem, I was able to contact the seller and resolve this matter fairly quickly! I am extremely content with their customer service and would recommend them to anyone. I am getting a brand new night light with no extra cost or headaches! that's wonderful! Thank you very much!"
21989,2,"In short, try Lansinoh, Honeysuckle, or any other double locking bag. Sensible Lines Milk Trays and ice cube trays also work well and have very nice one ounce portions.Avoid these Medela bags if possible until they change the design.Over half a year ago, I bought these bags to go along with my Medela Pump In Style Advanced machine. You're supposed to be able to pump directly into the bag using the adapter that comes with the bags. That's a joke, mostly because it's likely you'll spill milk by leaning over while pumping at least once. In addition, it is difficult to see exactly how much you have pumped because the bags aren't a solid bottle-like form.Within the first month of pumping, I also bought Lansinoh bags and requested a free sample of Honeysuckle Breast Milk Storage Bags. Lansinoh bags are longer than Medela's and have a DOUBLE ZIPPER SEAL. They are great and the Honeysuckle bags look just as good.Tonight I pumped extra and wanted to use up some of my Medela bags, putting just 70 ml in each. Just as I was putting them in the freezer I noticed one bag was not fully closed and it leaked everywhere. True, it's my fault for not realizing the bag wasn't fully zipped shut, but because these bags are shorter, milk sometimes gets between the zipper and you might not realize the bag is not fully closed.A double zipper would give you a better fighting chance of securing your milk, and a longer bag would also help make sure that milk doesn't get ""caught"" between the zipper. I was going to write a review of these months ago, but I decided to simply shelf the box and move on. Tonight's fiasco made me remember why I put these away and used Lansinoh's bags instead.I don't remember anyone pointing out that the other brands were better because of the longer length, so I'm posting this myself now. You could also store more per bag with the other brands, but you might rather the flexibility of defrosting smaller amounts later on. Again, a tray that allows you to store 1 ounce portions is nice as well, though consider the size of your bottle and make sure the frozen bar/cube can fit in it, or devise a different way of defrosting the milk. Have fun!Back to the drawing board with these, Medela!"
98426,0,"We have a set of twins, my boy did like, but my daughter kept crying so I didn't use it. I guess because of the feel..."
61842,2,"I purchased this for my daughter because I loved the bath and bumper so much. However it was a joke. Completely worthless, it did absolutely nothing to support her when she started sitting on her own. I tossed my after about 2 uses. Your better off with the old fashioned plastic ring seats. Seriously don't waste your money. I can't imagine how anybody could find this prodcut useful."
53806,1,Ordered a few of these letters. They are so cute and have a very nice finished. Price was very reasonable as well.
184785,1,"Nice size, but the two bassinets tend to lean to the center. My girls slept in it for a few weeks but now they want no parts of it. Hopefully they will eventually use the play yard."
61691,0,"First the possitives: I Get lots of compliments, It nice to look at, its got a smooth ride, its sturdy, I love that when my son falls asleep I can recline him all the way back, I also love that on windy days I can face him towards me so that wind was not so bad on him.The negatives: It is very bulky, it is very heavy, you need two hands to put this together, the one thing I really hate are the safety straps, I have never seen such flimsy straps ever, all my son has to do is lean forward and his arms are out. It is hard going into stores without running over stuff, especially in NY where they pack those isle like theres no tomorrow."
2381,1,this is so good. I love this. very convenient and useful. I especially like the price and the color of the it.
64292,1,I bought a pink book for my daughter and the green one for my son and think they're just great. So much so that I just purchased one for a shower gift as well!
170797,2,"I received 3 of these graco sheets for my Graco Silhouette Pack n Play. We will be using the bassinet for the first few months as the primary sleeping area for our baby. I am really disappointed with the quality and the fit of these sheets.The quality is really really poor. The sheet feels super stiff and cheap. I can't imagine our baby would be comfortable on sheets like this. And they are so thin, i really thought they would tear. After many washes, they are still stiff and scratchy.I think i could look past the horrible quality of them if they would have at least fit well. They are way too loose and don't seem safe for an infant to be sleeping on. It even says on the sheet itself ""do not use unless it fits snugly"". Why the heck would you make a sheet for your own pack and play that doesn't even fit it correctly?Reducing the risks of sids is important so i will have to hem the sheets and try to get them to fit securely. Even so, i think i will be shopping for other sheets and only use these as a back up.These sheets are just not worth buying. Save yourself some trouble and money, and go with a different brand."
11156,1,"I consider this playard a good buy. It was easy to set up, although the directions could be confusing, as they were written for several model options and could not necessarily be followed sequentially. However, once figured out, the playard was very easy to assemble and adapt to multiple uses. Caution, the width is larger than most of the door entrances in my house, so if moving from room-to-room it may be necessary to partially disassemble. The purchase and delivery system through Amazon was outstanding."
23183,0,"It Seems like it would be a good toy. My daughter doesn't really care for it, she doesn't really play with it."
19934,0,"These are good little bowls for my little one, but they really don't stick very well to his high chair tray."
732,0,"My daughter finally bumped up to size 4, so I needed to pick a new diaper since swaddlers only go up to size 3. I LOVE swaddlers diapers, they are the best and I wish they went up to a higher size! (my daughter is only 7 months old) I have used Luvs diapers and I think I would compare the softness and texture of these Baby Dry to Luvs diapers, I do think they hold more and they do seem to keep her butt dry. However, they do just feel cheap. ALSO, the price on Amazon is just outrageous, I got my box from BJs for $35 (with a $5 coupon) subscribe and save used to be a GREAT DEAL on diapers and wipes, now the price is $45! You can get these for less somewhere else..."
112207,1,I love these diapers over any other disposable. They are very absorbent and the Cruisers allow my baby to crawl around with ease.
147672,2,"After the first night, we thought this sleep sack was ok. It fit fine, and the mesh opening at the bottom did seem to keep the boy's feet from getting too stinky. But there were issues: The satin lining makes it kinda hard to hold the baby--he slid around inside it too much. And the zipper is terrible! It feels chintzy from the first time you use it--the pull tab gets stuck. And then on the second morning, we brought our son into bed with us. After a little while we noticed little blue flecks on our sheets. The paint was peeling off the zipper's pull tab! I'm not a maniac about baby safety, and I understand that my boy will be exposed to things and put all kinds of dirt into his mouth, but I certainly don't want it to be detritus that comes off his supposedly baby-safe clothing.If it weren't for the zipper, I'd give this two or three stars. But because of that, it gets one. How hard would it have been for the manufacturer to use a better zipper?"
179332,2,"I'm a mother of twin nine month old girls. I chose these bottles for the design, no bubbles. I got over all of the parts you need to clean and what not. But then to find out they leak after about 5 to 6 months of use it is just wrong. I followed the instructions on care and cleaning and no where does it mention leaking or having to replace parts. I found out about the replacement parts after calling Playtex. I was told the replacement silcone is only .50 cents. I told customer service cost is not the point. I want a reliable product. If I had known in advance they would leak and I would need to call and order replacement parts I would have never purchased this product. I believe Playtex should put in their instructions replace of parts is needed. Then the choice is yours."
114696,1,"We are grandparents to 4 (so far) with 3 age 1 and under. I have actually purchased two of these booster seats and love them. They are so easy to set up, take down, travel with, etc. When they are set up they are extremely safe (at least we have never had a problem). We would highly recommend this product as a booster seat."
49672,1,Great baby pool float for introducing babies to water. My 10 month old loves being in it. Definitely recommend.
14081,0,I was disappointed to find out that my 9oz Avent bottles did not fit in my warmer like the 4oz bottles did. My bottles also leaked from the ring. [...]
127538,1,"I bought this crib after a lot of research, debate, in-store trials, etc. My main concern was sturdiness. I've seen some people give this product a poor review based on ease of assembly, but that is not fair or very helpful. It's a piece of furniture - it's going to take a little time and patience! I'm only giving this 4 stars because I don't know how it's going to hold up with baby. Also, we had to make one of the pilot holes a little deeper with a drill in order to get the holes to line up. Other than that one snag, it wasn't difficult to put together.This crib is very sturdy and the mattress that is recommended with the crib fits perfectly. I bought the espresso and it is really pretty and looks like it costs more than $250. If you want an awesome finish or wood that isn't going to dent - don't buy a soft wood crib like pine! Fork over the $800+ for an oak crib!Definitely recommend so far!"
132427,0,"Pros:-It's nice to have wipes (I put cloth wipes) anytime you want. My baby likes it warm.Cons:-It's really a bad design, I gotta say. Like other people have already described, the heating panel is located on the top. So you need to pile up your wipes very high. My baby poops once a day after he reaches 4 weeks old (and also many babies don't poop so many times a day). So who needs to put tons of wipe in the warmer when it will get dried eventually. They should redesign it better...-The price is too high for its quality and design. That's why I rated 3 stars.Advice:-I recommend people to get this warmer at a consignment store or the local craigslist. I got it only for $6. Many people are selling it only $5 in my area. I wouldn't pay $20-25 for this product...But again, I love my purchase! This is better than having nothing."
88106,0,"ONE OF THE RATTLES ON THIS ITEM HAS A HOLE WITH A SCREW IN IT. MY DAUGHTER A 6 MONTH OLD BUSTED HER LIP PRETTY BAD FROM THIS. DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD PULL THIS RING OFF AND PUT IT INTO THEIR MOUTH. I THREW THAT PIECE IN THE TRASH. OVERALL MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS GYM. PLEASE BECAREFUL. THANKS, A CONCERNED MOTHER"
145164,1,"I bought this jumperoo used and boy is it worth the money I paid for it! My little one is only 4 months old, but he's enjoyed this thing since 2 1/2 months. At 2 1/2 months he mainly just stared at the hanging toys and the lights and just sat and enjoyed the music (as I supervised and turned the music on for him). Now at 4 months he is jumping and making the lights and music happen on his own. Over Thanksgiving his 6 month old cousin got her turn in it and she LOVED it! She was interested in every single toy on this thing. It will be amazing to watch my son grow into this toy over the next few months. And that is what makes this jumperoo so great -- it is well built enough that you can put a tiny 2 1/2 month old in it, but it has enough entertainment value to keep a 6 month old occupied as well. This is one well thought out toy!"
93887,1,"This repellant lotion has a great light scent. My daughter has sensitive skin, and it didn't irritate her, or make her break out at all. Most importantly, she wasn't bitten. A little pricey but worth it."
110310,1,"This glider/ottoman combo was everything we thought it would be. The assembly wasn't bad and the cushions are really nice. The wood color is lighter cherry wood - lighter than I expected, but still looks nice in our nursery. This is a great buy if you compare to the big baby stores."
64565,0,This gate works well. But is not as photo shows. Photo makes it look finished and the wood has no finish at all. The knobs are not attached and are not as shown in photo. Very hard to adjust as the knobs just push into larger than screw holes. They are not attached to the gate. The handle for the door mechanism is flimsy. I am keeping only because of the height of the gate. High priced for what you get.
116211,1,"I absolutely love these things. They are one of the best baby products ever introduced. The only thing I dislike about them is that the adhesive is only on the top and bottom. Now that my son is 14 months old, he has figured out how to grab on the sides where there is no adhesive and pull up the mat. Until he learns eat off a plate without it ending up on the floor when we go out to eat (or at home for that matter!), we will be using these."
38070,0,THIS QUILT IS PROBABLY WORTH THE $25 BUT IT ISN'T MADE VERY WELL. DOESN'T HOLD UP IN WASH.
86239,2,"when I first bought this monitor I was ver pleased. the video is excellent and night vision works perfectly.unfortunately after 6 months the battery of the parent unit stopped working and would only worked if plugged in, so it was a pain cause I couldn't go outside and relax, had to stay near the unit where the plug was. as I live in another country I couldn't call for the warranty. would not recommend this to anyone."
102106,1,I buy these for my 3 year old. He has been PT for a while now but still wets almost every night. This keeps him and his sheets dry at night. Great product!!!
123557,1,"I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants a safe place for their child to play while they are doing housework. It is square and provides more play area than the traditional rectangular pack 'n play. One of the unexpected perks was that my daughter taught herself how to pull herself up into a standing position in this playpen. Next thing I knew my husband was encouraging her to walk along the perimeter. That is one of her favorite games.If you want to make this pack 'n play a success I have several recommendations.1. Introduce your baby to it when they are young so they get used to its confines. We first began putting our daughter in it when she was 4 months old for 5 minutes a day. She is now 8 months and spends much longer periods playing in it. She also asks to be put into it.2. Encourage your baby to explore the toys on the sides. My daughter loves grabbing and crinkling the wings.3. Play with your baby while they are in the pack 'n play. We like peek a boo.4. Have special playpen only toys. Also make sure they are soft so if they fall on them they can't be hurt.5. Location, Location, Location. Ours is strategically located in our family room where she can see me while I work in the kitchen. It is also next to a window where she can enjoy the outside view.6. DO NOT use this as a sleep area. This is a play area. You should have a separate sleep area. Don't confuse your child.7. Attitude. If you view this playpen as a ""trap"" or ""jail."" You'll never use it. Remember, the purpose of the playpen is to provide your child a SAFE place to play when you are distracted."
53917,1,"Bath time was a scream fest during the first few weeks at home! After several nights of lying her flat on the counter with a towel and listening to her screaming and crying, I decided to pull out the bath seat I got at my shower. I thought it would be too big for her (it is still but that means there's room to grow). I laid the towel in the seat and gave her the usual sponge bath and got NO TEARS! She loved it, at least liked it more than the lying flat method! It works great for these early baths before the stump falls off and I know it will be great in the tub later until she can sit up! Great product, and good price!"
32641,1,"I purchased this gate just recently because I have a eleven month old son who is always trying to climb up the stairs. I purchased an inexpensive gate several months ago and it wouldn't even mount properly. There are several reasons why I am so pleased with this gate:1). It's pressure mounted so there are no holes in my walls.2). Each of the pressure mounts can be adjusted individually. What I mean by that is each pressure mount twists forward until it reaches the wall. The reason this was so important for me was because my home has old wood work and the baseboards are almost seven inches high and about an inch thick. If each of the pressure mounts were not separately adjustable, then the gate would meet at the baseboard, but would not be able to touch the wall. This gate handles that dilemma beautifully.3). It's extremely durable and sturdy. My son grasps onto it and shakes it violently and it doesn't budge. And because it's made of metal, there are no worries about splinters and cracking.4). It's attractive and comes in different colors. We choose white and it looks great.5). It was wide enough that I could mount it at the bottom landing of our stairway without an extension. There are extension kits available if you need them though.6). Finally, I like the swing door feature. I can use the gate with one hand so it's convenient when I have my son in the other hand. The handle is also very easy to open and close with one hand.I know this is a lot of info but when I was searching for a gate, these are the types of things I wanted to know.I highly recommend this gate to anyone looking for one for the bottom of their stairs or a doorway."
125250,0,My little guy hasn't quite figured this out yet. He doesn't know whether it's to suck on or chew on. We've only given it to him a handful of times and he usually has a look of confusion on his face while he figures out what to do with it. I definitely like the concept though.
109703,1,"I don't generally write reviews but wanted to praise Baby Trend on the design of this car seat. We were directed to it after the January 07 Consumer Reports review showing this as one of only two infant car seats to pass their more stringent crash tests (TV news showed alarming video of various car seats flying around the passenger compartment after being struck by a vehicle).Compared to our still-new Safety 1st seat, this one is so much better engineered in a number of ways:1) The base is super easy to install. Click twice into each of the car's two anchor points, then tug on each of the two straps to tighten the base. That's it. Our old seat had paragraphs of confusing directions that didn't leave me as confident as this one.2) The base has an easily adjustable tilting mechanism and leveling indicator to insure you get the right angle for the baby's head (no flopping). Our old seat had no such system - we used rolled-up towels.3) The seat has a dial to quickly adjust the seat height as the baby grows. No such system on our old seat.4) The handle has an ergonomic triangle shape on top for more secure grasp when reaching into the car from the left or right.5) If the base is not available, the seat can be strapped directly into a car using the car's lap belt.6) The seat is overall more narrow than our old seat, allowing our two other kids to fit in the back seat with a little more breathing room. Every inch helps.7) The seat is lighter than our old seat, although it feels just as secure and solid as the old one.All this, and the seat is the same price as our old one. Unfortunately Amazon/Target was sold out when the Consumer Reports issue came out, but I found them in stock online at Wally World, if you are looking to get one quickly. The one for sale here is a better color combo than Wally's, unless you like lime green - but the seats themselves are all the same superb design.Summary: super easy to install and adjust, well thought-out features, fair price! Makes me want to have more kids just to buy more of these :)"

18398,0,"I was very excited about these bottles but became very frustrated when they started to leak around the rim. Even following all the instructions(which it was another thing I didn't like, they are high maintanance bottles)they still leaked and I gave it up."
169067,1,"These diapers are perfect for my two month old. They don't leak like some other brands we have tried and don't irritate her skin. A fine product all around. Plus, buying from Amazon they deliver within two days and extended my Prime shipping."
36399,0,"Unfortunatey I have not been as thrilled with this pillow as I anticipated. Like other purchasers, I realized that the pillow was not long enough if you want to have it between your feet AND knees. Having the separation between your whole leg down to the foot is what I find to be relieveing of back pain. I decided to flip the pillow around the opposite way as I had read another reviewer tried and this seems to be much better for me. I use my regular pillows under my head and just push this pillow further down the bed to use it for me knees and feet.The pillow itself is good quality, nice and fluffy but it is very large and takes up most of my queen size bed. Im overall glad that I purchased it because it has given me some relief, just not as much as i had hoped for."
107766,1,"As a stay-at-home mom, I didn't think I needed an electric pump since I am rarely away from my baby for more than a few hours. This pump is easy to use, extremely comfortable and very efficient...I can pump a four ounce bottle in ten minutes! It may not work well for the full-time pumper, but it has certainly done well for me!"
115113,1,"We had a hard time finding a gate that we did not want to be permanent (no screwing into the wall, etc.), until we found this one. We have a 47"" staircase opening and an odd stairway bannister that no other gate would fit. This gate worked perfect, and is as tall as our staircase, which helps to blend in well. It is not bulky, and the latch is small, so we hope there will be no attempts to break through! The only regret is that to get a laundry basket past, it has to go over, the basket is too wide for the gate opening. My 8 year old has manuevered this gate, it also automatically shuts after going through it.....I would highly recommend this gate!!"
132313,2,"These were alot bigger then I expected, make sure that you have a perfect spot for these, they look best clustered together like one on top and two on the bottom, they to were not the exact color I thought they would be, they were faded to."
81901,2,I am a first time mom and had no idea how breastfeeding would go. After being home for a day or two I started using this pump just to see if had enough milk and to give my nipples a rest. I developed a breast infection and I truly believe it was due to this pump. It is terrible and it takes forever to get an ounce of milk. After having two infections in a two week period my Mom purchased me the Medela pump in style. It is a completely different experience. I have not had another infection and is not nearly as rough on my breast at this pump was. I also know someone else who used this pump and developed breast infections. She switched to the Medela and hasn't had anymore problems.
71077,1,"This is a great seat, I put it together with no problems. My child can kick her legs and actually rock it herself a little, which provides her entertainment. The only thing I see that is of concern is the hard toys that hang down: if the seat is not reclined in the furthest position the toys will hit the baby in the face when it is rocked, which is not good. I guess once baby is big enough to sit more upright, the toys will need to be removed. Other than that, the price was good and the seat is handy to have around when my hands are full."
6706,1,"Cruisers are the best diapers, period. It's worth the extra 14 cents or whatever for quality. And having this huge box shipped from Amazon (no shipping) was quick an easy."
69378,1,"First a package was $10.29/10.49, then $7.49 (sale) and now it's $10.29 on sale with a 20% discount!Go fool somebody else Amazon. I can buy a package for that price at the drugstore around the corner!"
81027,2,"At first glance, this looks like a great seat. I love the regular Cushie Tushie and thought the travel one would be perfect. However, the travel version has issues that I haven't seen others mention yet. The plastic heat sealed seams pucker at the corners as gathered fabric will usually do at corners. However,the gathered plastic is scratchy, almost sharp and irritated my toddler's bottom. She refused to use the seat after the seams scratched her bottom and thigh."
43172,1,"Recently my miniature Dachshund lost the use of her back legs. After shopping in thrift stores, flea markets etc, I was not able to find any inexpensive practical baby stroller to enable me to still take my dog for walks. I saw this product for sale as part of a two piece stroller system for infant carriers in my local big box store. It is meant to hold an infant carrier and convert it into a stroller. Most strollers I looked at were huge, and a bit ""fussy"" for a dog! The stroller fame is sturdy yet lightweight. It folds compactly and easily and fits into my very small car for transport to our favorite park for evening walks. The sturdy mesh bottom compartment is the perfect size for my little Roxy to lie in comfort and see all around her as we walk. I was especially surprised to see the same item on Amazon.com priced cheaper than my local retailer. I would recommend this product to any pet owner with a disabled small dog, as it is considerably less expensive than strollers designed specifically for animals. My dog loves it and looks forward to her daily walks."
143573,0,"Can anyone tell me what the dimensions are? I don't know if it will fit my big double stroller. I have an old school ""Baby Jogger"" that's pretty big."
66072,0,"I bought these to help reduce gas. I really like the fact that they hook up directly to my breast pump; however, my son did not like the narrow mouthed bottles. When he latched onto the narrow nipple, his lips hit the plastic ring/cap of the bottle. He may have done fine on the wide-mouthed bottle, but we just used the platex bottles we already had at home. He accepted the platex natural latch nipples much easier.The concept of these bottles is really great- a bit cumbersome to clean, but really good concept. Wide mouthed would probably be better than narrow, but with most bottles and pacifiers you will just have to figure out what features are most important to you and see what your baby will accept."
153031,2,"Three major issues with this order. First tools ARE required to install this, dispite what the ""no-tools needed"" advertisement. You will need to screw in the top portion of the lock into your door. So if you ever decide to remove this device you will have screw holes showing above the handle. Secondly the product DOES NOT work. Even with the snapping mechanism engaged you can grab just enough of the bottom to open it, defeating the purpose of the device. Finally returns are costly. After talking to customer service and attempting a return, some interesting facts came up. I ordered 3 of these locks and opened 1 to install. Baby mart will only allow me to return 2 of the 3 devices. The other opened package I needed to contact the manufacturer themselves to try and get a refund. Additionally return shipping cost is on my dime. So after spending $30 I can really only recoup $5-10 of my original purchase (returning 2 instead of 3 and paying for my own shipping). I tried giving this a 0 star rating but it seems the lowest I can give is 1 star. I would not recommend this product."
114644,1,"I love this little chair, it doesn't take up any more floor space, it cleans easily, its adjustable for a growing baby...etc, etc...I'm very pleased with this purchase."
73130,1,"I bought this Floppy Seat when my son outgrew his Snugride carrier at 6-7 months. He is now 10 months and I can't imagine life without it!Reasons why I'm glad I bought it:1. Good sizeFits most shopping carts perfectly and provides complete coverage. Sure, it's a little large for some of the smaller shopping carts or restaurant highchairs, but the excess material doesn't really get in the way. In this case, I think its better to have too much than too little.2. ProtectionThe Floppy Seat was especially useful when my son was smaller and had trouble sitting up straight in the seat. It gave him some extra cushion for comfort and protection while keeping him strapped snuggly into the cart.3. ConvenienceThis item is easy to wash, easy to carry, and easy to put onto shopping carts. Also, it has a pocket on the inside of the seat that can be used for storage of a small bottle or toy. It's fairly compact if you take the time to roll it up into its built-in pouch. It's nice to be able to roll it up for taking into a restaurant for a highchair or if you're short on space in your car (I usually just throw it in my car without bothering to roll it up though!).I definitely recommend this product."
74669,1,What a great walker... and it's so inexpensive! My baby girl just loves to be in it. It's built her upper body strength up and she can sit on her own now. I'm sure she'll be an early walker now also. I like that the top can be easily taken off and cleaned or we can put other toys in it's place to change up the scenery. I'm so glad I got it!
162380,0,"We received this kit as a shower gift for our now 11-month-old son. I would recommend buying higher quality items separately. My fave item is the clipper - the handle makes the whole process a lot easier. We haven't used the medicine spoon yet but our pharmacy gives those away. This one looks like it will work fine, though. The nose aspirator is absolutely useless in my opinion. I have tried to use it with no results - we use the big blue one we received at the hospital. We used the thermometer under the arm and it takes a pretty long time to get a reading. I purchased a fast speed model from The First Years for under $10 that works great.At first I thought the medicine dropper was great but after using it a week, it just seemed to lose it's suction. It was more and more difficut to suck the medicine out of the bottle and likewise give it to my son quickly. The one nice thing is the lid, you can pre-measure medicine for later. My son had a terrible bout with an ear infection that just wouldn't go away until we used several anti-biotics, so we have much experience with these care items. When dealing with a squirming, sick baby, you want these items to work well and quickly. If I could go back to last year at this time when I was still pregnant, I would spend a little bit more to buy a better version of each item."
77326,1,"This swing saved us with our first son. He had reflux, was very colicky and would basically only fall asleep when he was in this swing. He was captivated by the lights and the lullaby songs. Our son was large, always in the 95 percentile for weight and height so we weren't able to utilize the swing for a long time, maybe only 3 or 4 months but it was well worth the money.The only thing is the clicking sound you hear when the swing is on. At first it didn't do this but when our son grew larger it started and now still has the same sound. I can say some people may be bother by this but we didn't mind. The sound is repetitive and not obnoxious so it seemed to soothe our son instead of bother him.We're just days away from having another baby. The swing is up and everything is working great! All in all this was a great purchase!"
71222,1,"I have been very happy with this rocker. My son was born a month ago, and almost from the time we brought him home, we have been able to use the rocker and he seems to be pretty happy sitting in there. He recently started staring very intently at the little toys and the black-and-white bar they dangle from. He doesn't control his arms yet, but I'm sure he'll be swatting at the toys soon. This rocker is much more affordable than some others I looked at, but it seems very sturdy and I like that you can either set it up to rock or put down the kickstand and have it stay put. It's also fairly light, so we can easily move it from one room to another. Of all the gear we purchased for the baby, this is one of the items that has gotten the most use. I would definitely recommend it to other new parents."
4580,0,"Seems well constructed, but I am not a fan of the cover being attached with Velcro. I think this is so you can swap covers, but snaps might have been a better choice as I can see this Velcro business being annoying. There is a lot of Velcro and it is quite sticky making opening the bag one handed potentially tricky."
63132,2,"If you happened to melt your tubing during sanitizing, but still have the plastic inserts and need just the tubing, save yourself money and time and head to the nearest pet store - this tubing is identical with aquarium tubing and it will cost you a whopping $2!Second, DO NOT sterilize any tubing -the material is too soft to withstand higher temps. If you look at the pump closely, you will realize that milk never touches the tubing so there no need to do more than wash with soap.All above is based on my actual personal experience."
125578,1,"This was one of my little boy's favorites. High quality, perfect shape and texture. Your little one will LOVE it."
157425,1,We received this changing table as a gift. It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. It fits everything we need to diaper on a daily basis.
117591,1,"This is a great jumper that my daughter absolutely loves. She began using it when she was about 4 months old (I put a folded up blanket in the back for extra support). She is now 6 months old and loves it even more now. I have two daughters. For my first daughter (who is now two), I tried two jumpers, the Fisher Price Precious Planet floor jumper, and the cheap Evenflo Johnny Jumpup and this one is far better than either of those two. The Evenflo jumper was uncomfortable around her legs, was too high waisted and has hard bars that she could have hit her head on - plus the spring is just too tight that it doesn't allow for good jumping at all - it ended up in the closet because it was useless and dangerous. The Fisher Price Precious Planet floor jumper is decent and has lots of bells and whistles, but also doesn't really allow the baby to jump very much (more like a swaying back and forth) and my first daughter (and now my second) got sick of it really fast. In my experience, the more bells and whistles something has, the less the child actually enjoys it. So when I was pregnant with my second child, I began researching a better jumper. This one came to the top of the list and has remained at the top of the list for the following reasons:1. It allows your little one to actually jump! The spring is the perfect tightness for controlled jumping.2. The attached toys and toy tray are a wonderful addition. The toys are great for teething babies, and have no obnoxious sounds. The toy tray around the jumper is nicely padded and gives extra protection for your little one in case they hit the doorway. It also allows you to put your child's favorite toy in front of them which they can play with while jumping - at present, my daughter has her soft teething ring there and grabs it whenever she wants to.3. The clamps up top are well designed and easy to put on any doorway.4. It adjusts well to any height (those reviews that state that it's not long enough obviously didn't read the instructions that came with it on how to adjust the height - after the obvious adjustment, you can then pull the short loop through and adjust it more, it's very easy to do).5. It's easy to put my daughter in and take her out of it.6. The colors are nice and will go well with most decor7. The price! It's slightly more than the Evenflo jumper, but why waste your money on that useless jumper when you can have this one. It's also MUCH cheaper than the floor models with all bells and whistles but works much better6. My daughter LOVES it! My only regret is that I didn't have it with my first daughter.I highly recommend this jumper over any others."
150636,1,"This is a soft snuggly blankie and matches Cocalo's Tropical Punch nursery decor items. Our baby loves it - it's just big and thick enough to cover her warmly in a single layer but not too big or heavy for her to get entangled in or overheated. It gets washed every week, sometimes twice a week, and has not yet developed any naps or snags in the fabric or loose strings which is a plus."
156737,1,My little guy has loved this since he was four months old. I'm very happy with every aspect of it and would highly recommend it.
179561,1,"I take a lot of airplane flights with my son by myself. The Go-Go Babyz Kidz Travelmate has been a lifesaver. I no longer have to wrangle checking a carseat, stroller and luggage (while trying to keep track of my kid). It is so easy to use that I've now managed to find a way to strap the car seat to the wheels without having to take my kid out of the seat! On every trip we take, there is always someone who stops me in the airport to ask me what the Go-Go Babyz is and where I got it. If you are even remotely considering purchasing this item, do it! You won't be sorry! It is highly worth the investment."
36907,0,"I bought this set and the one with two flowers for my daycare about a month ago. I had never heard of them, but I thought they were so cute I had to give them a chance. I love the way they look on the wall in the daycare and the kids love to take them down and play with them. They are extremely cute and I feel like the actual pieces are well made. The music player in them is very cheap and hard to hear, when it's working, the one in the airplane already stopped working. I will probably order a few more sets, even though I was not impressed with the sound. I like them for the way they look and that is reason enough for me to buy more."
22706,1,we have actually used it more at home since it has worked so well for traveling. would recomend to everybody. packs up really small.
176314,0,"I was so engorged that i had no option but to buy a breast pump, at the time this was the only pump available to me. for its price its quite costly but i guess the brand is a factor.when i started to use it i pumped almost 6-8 ounces a go, but cause i had a single pump i was leaking from the other side at the same time which was a waste of milk. when it comes to buying a breast pump it becomes quite a controversial opinion.not ever women will feel pleased with the product. i used it more for relief then anything else. my baby wouldnt latch so i couldnt do anything except pump.but what i would recommend is to buy the big double, pump in style breastpump, which i borrowed from my friend and that one is great, its noise free and more painless. the pumping of both breasts becomes more easier and quicker and there is storage for milk bottles and a cooler.. i guess its for moms who want to pump when they're at work. its also a carry case pump. very trendy."
119268,1,"I was unsure about this product before I bought it. I am so pleased that I took the chance. This is wonderful. Big and cute and so easy to apply to a wall. I had to remove and re-stick several times to get it right. My little boy loves it. If you don't want to fool with wall paper borders, then this is for you."
56751,1,I received these as a gift before my daughter was born and wasn't really sure what I was supposed to do with them since we had planned to use dispoasble diapers. Then my husband suggested using them as burp cloths...they're awesome! They're soft against baby's sensitive skin and wash up nicely. Now they're a standard gift for our friends that are expecting.
115675,1,"As a very compact stroller, this one is pretty good. I looked at many umbrella strollers and most did not have 5 point harnesses or aren't comfy for someone over about 5'2"". Now I'm a hair under 5'8"", but I wouldn't recommend this for anyone taller. My husband at 6' had to hunch over to push it. Another issue is that the wheels are pretty close together and the handles don't tilt back far enough to provide a lot of separation between your feet and the wheels. You do have to walk heel-toe if you are going to walk behind the stroller and that not only takes a little getting used to, but can be tiring because you don't use your normal walking muscles.It has a very small basket underneath that can store some smile items, but because of the cross back support, you can't put a bag of any size under there, but it's good for small purchases. Also, while it does recline, it's not much, but more than you would see on other umbrella strollers.Another plus is that it is significantly wider than the Jeep umbrella stroller and the other low price ones. My 3 month old looked cramped in that one and I cannot imagine her being able to use it for long. This stroller should last us for travel purposes (especially on the subway) for a couple of years.I also like that the sunshade can be snapped to the back of the stroller or you can unsnap it and change the angle depending on where the sun is.I recommend you take a test push of this before purchasing. They have them instock in limited colors at Babies R Us, but that's good advice for any stroller purchase."
29264,1,"We bought this for our 2 year old grandson, one for his home and one for ours. He knows right where it is and uses it mainly for brushing his teeth and washing his hands. Good investment"
101753,1,"Fits nicely on stroller w/ velcro straps. Just a little smaller than I realized. Can really only fit about 2 diapers, wipes and powder. There is a small pouch on the side for bottle or sippy cup. That's about it. Good for quick trips."
50429,0,"I was so excited to receive this pillow, as I'm 7 months pregnant and finally showing and not really able to sleep on my stomach anymore. It is comfy and full, and I didn't find the included pillow case itchy as many other reviews said, but I also don't see why it's SO fabulous. I like that it goes between my legs and I use the top part as a pillow, and yes, it's comfy, but seems quite large for something that basically only helps between my knees. I can't figure out how the long side could possibly provide back support. I've tried re-positioning many ways, but after about 60 seconds it's no longer even touching my back, it's just a long large pillow which lies behind my back (or in front of me but not supporting my belly either and takes up sooo much room in the bed. Wondering if maybe a U-shaped pillow would provide more support? It's expensive to simply be a pillow between my knees and my head, as I have regular pillows for my head."
20867,1,"I must say that I was not up for trying these out at first. I was just going to ""hand wash and save my money"" pshhh yeah right. Once I had my baby I had no time to hand wash anything. I use the dishwasher now! Needless to say I went and purchased these from target because I needed something right away to sterilize my breast pump to use it because I don't put my baby's things in the dishwasher. I have two different branded double breast electric pumps; Evenflo and playtex and i can fit all the parts per breastpump per bag at one time and in 3 minutes they are hot and steaming clean ready to use!! The easiest best money ever spent!!! you get 20 uses out of each bag and that is a good deal for the price because the pack comes in 5. that is a 100 times to sterilize...YAY!!"
60979,1,"I really like the Diaper Genie... I can finally walk into my nursery and not tear up from the smell of dirty/stinky diapers! Although I have found the smell-free zone appealing, there are a few drawbacks to the device. It is a bit complicated to figure out... make sure you save the instructions, you will need to review them from time to time. It does fill up fast, but I would be changing a regular diaper pail just as frequently. The refill bags last for a reasonable amount of time (about three weeks), but you do have to buy Playtex's brand of refills and not some of the cheaper generic brands. (Be careful too that you get the correct refill bags, since there is a wide mouth unit and a smaller older version.... I can thank my husband for finding out about that one!) All in all, I have found that the benefits far outweigh the pains in using this device. If I had to do it over again, I would opt for the unit just so that I can enjoy time in my nursery with my baby without having to feel like I am trapped in a porto-potty!"
109494,1,"Great thing, it really helped me. My son got his amount of vitamins while I stayed worry free about choking."
129867,1,"this is great to put in a second vehicle like grandmas, so you can just pop the infant car seat in and out, and the car seat is already securely installed."
79926,1,My son who is now 6 months old has used nothing but these wipes since he came home and though he is very fair with sensitive skin he has had no problems with these wipes. They are durable enough to clean the messiest messes but are soft and clothlike so they are gentle to his skin.
9401,1,"We've had this for 7 months!Well designed...easy to clean, and easy on the tush.We just empty, rinse, and wipe with a lysol wipe to sanitize.My 3 yr old son has anxiety about big toilets, and still uses this even though he's been potty trained with NO accidents for 6 months. He'll use a ""big potty"" if there's nothing else, but he loves the independence of using this one...and frankly so do I.We're buying another one for my daughter and I'm actually excited about potty training!I read all the reviews, but I was still scared about buying this one, we had already tried 2 others, and this one is more expensive.IT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY!!!We plunked this sucker in front of the television, and sitting for the long wait for #2 wasn't torture for him.The front is nice and high...although we still had to teach him to hold his [...] down to avoid messes. Nothing is mess-proof during potty training, but this one DEFITELY cut down on the spills.We used stickers as rewards, and he put them on his potty.The container is big...the other products we tried had tiny containers.Okay, I know there are more awesome things about this potty, I just can't think of them right now."
29027,1,"I used these nipples with my daughter, and they were perfect! It was an easy transition from breast to bottle and back. These never gave me any issues with clogging and were always easy to clean. My daughter loved them and the flow was perfect for her.Now, I'm using them with my son and he loves them too! I cannot complain one bit about these nipples. I have had nothing but good luck with them and would and have recommended them to friends and family. I love the Drop-Ins system, but I was worried about the other nipples and wanted something more like the breast. Thanks to Playtex for delivering such a wonderful product!"
50781,1,"When I first started researching pregnancy pillows, I decided against buying one, convinced it was an expensive gimmick. But as my pregnancy progressed, I was waking up in pain, and could not find a comfortable position. I am normally a stomach sleeper, which is impossible now, and sleeping flat on your back is not advisable. The baby continuously kicked me if I slept on my left side, maybe I was leaning on him. That left me with very little options for a good night sleep. My first choice was the U shaped pillow, but all of them seem huge, leaving very little bed space my husband! I decided on C shaped pillow, and I am very happy I did. I actually prefer facing the C opening, which gives my back great support, like a hug. I tuck the bottom between my legs and under my tummy for support. I am petite, 5.2, so this option might not work as well for taller women.I can finally sleep on my left side! Plus, you can twist this pillow into a million shapes to build all kinds of supportive sitting or reclining structures. I will probably also use it as a breastfeeding pillow. It's a little tough to position yourself around the pillow every time you turn over, but that is normal- it is a big pillow after all, and pregnant women are not that agile. Some previous reviewers commented that this pillow retained body heat, making them very hot at night. The pillow does retain heat, (don't all pillows do that?) but I did not find that to be a problem at all. I get cold at night, and found that this feature was a pro, not a con. If I get hot, I just kick the blanket off. I haven't tried to wash the pillowcase yet, so I can't say anything about the ease of putting it back on the pillow. Regardless of that, I am very happy I purchased it.An update. Some reviewers complained that the cover was very difficult to put on the pillow after washing.I just washed the cover, and had zero trouble putting it on. It is an oddly shaped pillow, so I would recommend aligning the pillow to the pillowcase, so the ends are facing the same way. Grab the pillow by the curved end, and put it in the end of the pillowcase. Then, start pulling the length of the pillowcase down the pillow, just as you would a stocking, making sure the fit is tight. As you near the opening, stuff the other end into the pillowcase. It should be easier, because this end is less curved and is much closer to the opening. As both ends are stuffed in the pillowcase, the area around the opening will bulge- just force it inside- and viola! The pillowcase is on! It shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes. I would recommend following washing instructions - washing in warm water on gentle cycle, and drying on lowest heat setting. Perhaps some reviewers shrunk their pillowcases, which is why they had so much trouble putting them back on the pillow."
33149,1,"It does indeed adapt it so you can run the thing in the car. My wife used it on a cross-country trip we took and it basically saved our lives. Well, not our lives, but it does work."
19457,1,"If you haven't purchased your AVENT pump yet, DON'T. Get a Medela. This product is fine, it's exactly as described and the AVENT pump is great, I like mine. The problem is that the bottles SUCK for AVENT. Constant leaks. Just a warning for those still looking at pumps.... Run!"
156352,0,My only issue is that these tend to slip off my daughter's feet. Otherwise no complaints! Keeps her warm and happy through the night.
119681,0,"I have mixed feelings about this monitor. I did return it three different times because the hand held part makes this awful ticking sound, but finally gave up realizing I wasn't going to find one that worked properly. Our house is small enough that we don't need the monitor for it's actual use. The base that's in our daughter's room plays stars on the ceiling and cricket sounds that she LOVES! We kept the monitor for the stars and sounds because it's the only thing that will calm our daughter down when she's fussy. We will have to buy another monitor eventually."
104970,1,My Grandmother loves this soap. It cleared up her psoriasis after about 2-months of using it.
84445,1,"I got this swing specifically because of the tray. Its soooo much easier to lock a child into this swing than the one with the stupid chest bar, which my child hates. He got this as a Christmas gift about a year ago and, until recently, he used it E-V-E-R-Y day. Without fail. Very durable and fun."
135179,1,"my niece needed it to hep relieve the pain in her back... she is having another baby in may, the first one will be 1 in may... This pillow is a blessing."
163975,1,This is my second child. With my first I bought the snugli and hated it. I felt she would fall out if I leaned over and never had use of both hands because I would use one hand to hold her. SO with my second I did some research and purchased this at Toys R Us because Babies R us didn't have it yet. I love it. I have used it for my one month old son and it is easy to put him in and out while sleeping and the gel padding are a must on my shoulders. ANd best of all I have complete use of both hands and can bend over to pick up what ever I drop without him falling out! The only dislike it the zipper in the front is use for a rain hood. I would rather have some place to put my money and credit card.
20585,1,"The Jumperoo is worth its weight in gold in that it provides so much in the way of fun and physical development for our 5 mo old grandson. He loves everything about it: the stimulii of the toys, sounds, jumping and being able to remain in an upright position to look around. We only regret that this apparatus wasn't available when our children were this age. Five stars for this activity toy."
92522,0,"Given the large number of good reviews, we were quite excited about this. Not very useful and requires a lot of effort - we finally went for an electric one"
33374,1,They worked great in getting me ready for my little one and since this was my first baby I can say it was worth giving them a shot and I'm grateful I did!
37709,0,"I would have to agree with the other reviews on the fact that these wipes are too thin. I also agree that huggies wipes are a lot better. When my son has a dirty diaper i have to fold the wipes to get a little more cloth between my hand and my baby in order to avoid any mess left on me. Also, I have a wiper warmer and whenever I pull the wipes out, they stretch too much. I don't know if it's a bad thing or not but for me, it's kind of annoying. They do the job its just the quality of the wipe is not all that great."
3507,1,"My son is 10 months old, but i recieved the car seat last June, as a shower gift. At the time i was like mom y did u buy such a huge seat. I finally put it in the car last week and its going to b great. It has a lot of space, I think I may can sit in it:) It was much easier than i thought to attach to my seats in the car. Im a new mommy so if anyone reads this can u help me figure out the best neck pillow for my son, im afraid his neck is going to get stiff when he falls asleep!!! I think he needs the neck pillow like on the airplanes!"
125125,0,this would have been a great product if it actually fit in my son's mouth. he can't open his mouth wide enough. its big enough for me for heaven's sake. what were they thinking?....Update. My son is 8 months old and the teether finally fits. He likes it now. We needed it a few months ago as his fron teeth are already in. Maybe they need to create a smaller size.
125282,2,"I was very excited when I found these. I have 5 kids and with my youngest it looked like a great new possible solution to help during teething. My daughter seriously hated these. I'm not sure if it was the texture, the material used, etc. She just never liked them and I stopped trying to offer them when she started crying just from looking at them O_o At least we tried."
120875,1,"I like that it stays open if I need it to, but if I open it and let it swing back it will close automatically."
128873,2,"I ordered these nipples because my children will not take any other and I was so excited to find them since they have become so hard to find! I was willing to pay the outrageous price just to get them in hand. I waited, anxiously for them to arrive, only to find an entirely different item in the box. Instead of 2 squared off laytex fast flow nipples as pictured, I recieved 2 silicone rounded nipples. I am angry not only for the false advertising, but also because I have to now send them back and pay a re-stocking fee to the company who sent them out! Amazon - you let me down!!!!"
41509,2,"Today is the 2nd day we have been using this diaper but we already washed the crib sheet twice. It leaks a lot! What makes it worse is it irritates my kid's skin. Everytime after I put it on, she starts to scream and cry. We just ordered 2 boxes from Amazon. Now we have to go buy some other diapers."
19966,2,"I got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray. Trying to outsmart him, I purchased these hoping to keep some food in a bowl. Much to my disappointment, they only stick to the formica countertops well. The littlest one doesn't even stick to that. None of them stays on my son's plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two.On the upside, the lids are secure once shut all the way (which can take a little work), so they make great storage for on-the-go finger foods in the diaper bag...I haven't had one leak yet, and I put things like applesauce in them to test them. Not a total waste of money, now that I found this alternate use. They wash well, without any noticeable breakdown of the plastic, on the top rack of the dishwasher."
42797,1,"This wrap is soo comfortable. I initially purchased an over the shoulder ring sling and found that no matter how I positioned my baby my neck and back would end up killing me afterward. Then someone at my mothers group introduced me to the Moby and I fell in love. No more aches and pains and my baby loves it. Whenever he is fussy and he sees me take it out, he calms down. It looks complicated to put on, but with a few practice runs you will soon become a pro. I just started carrying him facing out and he is really enjoying it. This carrier is a great investment since it works for all ages (newborn - toddler) and there are so many different ways to wrap it. There is even a wrap for nursing, and one for carrying twins! I cannot recommend this enough!"
94495,1,These are great bottles and Amazon.com is the best for everything.
62641,1,"The new Diaper Genie is A LOT easier than the old one. For an infant or baby it's great, but since their diapers don't stink that bad, you can just throw them in the regular trash. I only use it in my nursery and throw all my other diapers in the trash anyway.For really stinky diapers I use ziploc bags. Not sure if that's expensive or not but they work great.I threw one of my two year old's poop diapers in the Diaper Genie two days ago just to test it. Later that day the stench in the room was horrible! Once I opened the Genie I almost puked, it was that bad. Don't use it for toddler poop!I think they need some kind of rubber ring to contain the odor better, but once you open it to empty it the smell is out no matter what.For my toddler I just empty her diaper into the toilet if it's solid (gross, I know) and then use a ziploc bag. If it's mushy (even more gross) I just ziploc it.I wouldn't say the Diaper Genie is a waste, but if you change your baby all over the house like I do don't bother with it.Also, some companies sell decorative covers for them that match the nursery. Or you can paint it or put stickers on it to decorate it. I left mine plain.And DO NOT hang deodorizers on your baby's wastebasket like someone suggested. They are poisonous if eaten by a child. Don't take the chance."
67999,0,"We just took a 12 day, 3 city trip that included planes, trains, and automobiles. The Gate Check Bag was really helpful in checking the stroller and keeping it clean and protected for the flight out. I think I may have used it one other time for the train or something, but when putting the stroller back in for the flight back, the bag ripped a little at the bottom. Not horrible. Made the trip the rest of the way home, but it won't survive another use. It's worth the money if you have a $100+ umbrella stroller that you want to protect. Think of it as insurance. I wouldn't waste the money though protecting an inexpensive stroller.The nylon is thin and the handle it comes with doesn't seem like it would hold up very long. Then again I was using our Graco IPO which nearly 18 lbs. The Uppababy G-Luxe would probably not tax this bag much at all since it's only 11 lbs."
40894,1,We started with Swaddlers and went into Cruisers. Never had a leak problem. Can't say the same for Huggies.
60993,1,I don't know why people can't use this product properly. I certainly think the diaper genie is the best product on the market. I think people who don't like this product must be mechanically impaired... People love to complain about a product unless they don't have do do anything. It's a sad state in America when people expect not to ever get their hands dirty.
137131,2,"I made the mistake of thinking this was an adult sized rocking chair. The website does not make it crystal clear that this is a child sized chair. When I tried to return the chair, Baby Age and its manufacture Giftmark gave me the run around about the entire return process, who would be taking it back, etc. They are asking for a 50% restocking fee (a bit outrageous?). I would not recommend buying from this company unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure of what you are getting."
40792,1,"I have always used Pampers for my daughter so when getting the diapers for her, I try to find the cheapest and easiest way. This offer from Amazon is great. It is cheaper than other sites and it has free 2nd day shipping even if I only buy one box at a time."
138258,1,"This night light is the perfect one, light up the room just enough for the kids, but not overly bright. It almost project to the whole ceiling from one corner of the room and the battery seems to last forever. Has 3 different color to choose from so it pretty much universal."
23649,1,"We have been using a Munchkin Feeding Friend Portable Hook On Chair - Monkey for about 6 months and it is horrible. This chair out of the box and on install was fantastic.Pros: Easy to assemble, Easy to install, Travels well.Cons: If I find one I will let you know."
131546,1,"We really like this foldable potty. A little large to travel with. Will not fit in most purses but easily fits into any diaper bag. Daughter fits on it well. 14 Months, 24#, 29"". She likes it. Folds/unfolds nicely. Do use some caution when placing her on the seat in case it buckles. She once slightly pinched the back of her leg due to mother's lack of attention :*( So fars seats very nicely on any toilet. Pleased with purchase!!!Amazon slow to ship."
47956,1,Comes with easy to install template. Great instructions. I put this gate up in a short amount of time and I like it because there are no footholds for my one year old to climb on like some other gates I've used. It's easy to open and close and swings in both directions. A great product!
132476,2,"Poor quality item. After a few months of use, the plastic lid broke at the point that holds the blue top in place. Now our wipes dry out, the lid regularly falls off, and the product has become a general hassle to use. I'm now trying to go through the process of getting it replaced by Munchkin, but they require sending it back and then waiting weeks for a replacement...probably more time, effort, and shipping costs than the product is worth.My biggest regret is that since buying mine, I've given several of these as gifts to other new parents. POOR QUALITY. Look elsewhere."
39558,1,The HALO is such a great product...my grand-baby sleeps peacefully in it. Other outfits didn't go over with her...back to the HALO!!
109549,1,They are designed well. I use it to feed my kid with fresh fruits. She can hold it and enjoy it for a while.
14825,0,"I bought a bunch of these bottles because many people have recommended them to me. My son HATES them.. the nipples are too hard for him and it takes him forever to get anything from them.. He wears himself out sucking on them. I finally switched to the gerber comfort hold bottles which he loves. They are similar but have softer nipples. My son is no longer cranky from not getting enough formula. I know alot of people love them, but my son doesnt. I never had a problem with leaks however as some people said."
171278,2,"After reading many good reviews, we registered for and received this product while expecting our first child. After she was born, however, it became apparent that it was a waste of money. She slid down the hammock constantly so we had to hold her up and keep her from having her head submerged, meanwhile, the hammock kept most of her body OUT of the water so she was cold. Perhaps some parents might be drawn to it because it will last them until their children are ""toddlers."" Good luck keeping a toddler in this thing! Perhaps if you have a shower only...but I think a bucket or deep try would work just as well and be a lot cheaper. After two or three baths I gave it away to a friend who was expecting and wanted to give it a try. We ended up using a towel on the bottom of the bathtub as a cushion until our daughter was old enough to sit up in the tub. When our second daughter was born we purchased a $6 infant bath sponge. It keeps her comfy, warm, and she loves it (and it dries a heck of a lot faster than the towel ever did). Skip this item all together."
53741,1,"This review is for both Sleep Tite Extra long and another comparable model, Hide Away Extra Long, of same brand. I am currently using both models so I can compare these two with each other.What's in common?Overall both are in good quality and solid enough for their purpose. The extra long length is a big advantage for my sleep-mobile kids. They don't just roll sideways. These rails are the longest ones I can find on market. They look very similar and basically have same mechanism for installation. Once installed properly, there is no gap(at least no gap that wide enough to be considered dangerous)between the rail and mattress. I use one for each of my girls. They are both serious rollers and more than often they lean against the rail and put their faces against the mesh. No suffocation worries. I know it's not for co-sleep but I use it for co-sleep with my younger daughter anyway. Don't see any issue.What's different?Portability: I ordered the Hide Away(HA) model first for my older daughter and liked it. So when my younger daughter refused to go back to her crib to sleep, I ordered another for co-sleeping. This time I tried Sleep-Tite(ST). The first thing I noticed is ST is much lighter than HA. Besides the top rail of ST can be folded in half, unlike the HA, which has just one solid steel rod. So if I need one for travel, I will definitely get ST because the HA is not really portable by its design and weight.Installation: The manuals are very detailed and helpful. ST is easier to install than HA because the fabric are put on differently. If you look at the pictures closely, you will see the top part of the HA is round cornered one-piece but in HA, there are two connecting pieces for top rail and side rail. In HA, I had to really squeeze the fabric to put on the rail along the turns. For ST it's easy because you can put on the mesh then bend the top and side rails to position.Sturdiness: Both are sturdy enough as I can tell. However, if I rock the rail hard, the ST is more wobbly because the folding mechanism. The HA is one piece of solid panel that barely moves. I use HA for my older daughter's bed. She would grab the rail when she tries to climb up to her bed (which I don't recommend your kid doing) and the rail support her very well. So you can tell it's pretty sturdy.Something interesting about the folding mechanism on ST: The hinge(or knot) in the middle of the top rail is protected with some sort of cushion. I guess it's to prevent children hitting on it since it's protruding and hard. It serves the purpose well. However, combined with the type of fabric they use, it is very ""crunchy"" and make noises when baby scratch it. It attracts my little girl to scratch more. So depend how you look at it, it's entertaining (for baby) and annoying (in the middle of night). I don't find myself bothered at all. Just funny.My complaints:The only thing bothers me is how the rail drops down. I first thought the push-in-under-mattress is a good idea in HA. However, it's very hard to do and run into the risk of ripping the bottom of mattress. I don't really need the ""Hide-Away"" feature since who cares if the bed is not picture perfect in a house with young kids. However, I do need the rail to be dropped down completely that I can sit on the edge comfortably for bedtime story. The problem is the ""hinge"" of the rail is at the level of the bottom of mattress. And the rail is pretty tall(a good safety feature though). So you need certain height of the bed to accommodate the whole piece. In my case, the rail would drop to floor at an angle that I couldn't sit on the bed without some hopping. It's not a problem on our adult-sized bed though.Another thing is I can't drop the rail with one shot. I have to go to the left to disengage the pin then go to the right to disengage the other pin before I can drop the rail. I am 5'4"" with not so long arms. I guess it's a trade-off of getting an extra long rail.In summary, both are good quality products I trust to put on kid's bed. If you need something for travel, use Sleep-Tite. If you don't plan to take it away, use Hide Away since it's more solid."
125000,1,My daughter is 6 months old and has been standing since she was 4 months old. The evenflo classic Johnny Jump up is her favorite thing to play in. It has strenghtened her legs which has really helped her learning to crawl. The jump up allows her to be more independent and she can use it in any doorway with crown molding. This allows her to hang out and watch mommy in every room. The jump up is easy to assemble and is very strong as well as safe. It is made of washable material and easy to put up take down or pack for traveling. I have one at home and one at grandma's house. It is also very affordable. I would give it *****
94600,2,"All the hype and high price tag are not worth it for these bottles. The only way you can get the nipples on these bottles without leaking is to put them on soooo tight that you can't get it off to wash them. Everytime I put the lid on and started to give to my son, it leaked (not a small little drop, I mean like pouring out!!!) all over him and I had to change his outfit. I should have wrote to the company and ask them to reimburse me for all of the laundry detergent that I went through because of the leaking. Several reviews, state if you do this they wont leak or if you do that or dont screw it on too tight or put the cap on and twist at this angle. I am sorry, but when you have a newborn, the last thing that you want to do is have to refer to the directions on the box at 3 am feeding!!!! Its a bottle, not a NASA Rocket! I used the platex liner bottles with my daughter and if I have another child, I will use platex, never these bottles again"
137834,1,"This turtle was given to us as a baby shower present for our first. I can't imagine having a child without something as terrific as this turtle. It was a great night light and visual soother for him as a baby, as he turned into a toddler, he slept with it- changing the colors and projecting it onto the ceiling and walls as a ritual of security before falling asleep. He looks for the moon, we point out the constellations, and no matter where the turtle is in the room- floor, bed, the stars are perfectly visible and bright. I love the automatic turn off, as he always falls asleep with it on, usually in his arms. He is three and a half now and we've only had to change the batteries twice.The bulb however is failing, and I actually searched for replacement bulbs but can't find any. For the $20, I feel it's absolutely worth buying another one. I also plan to buy these for friends as baby shower gifts. This turtle is well made, works perfectly as stated, and is essential for a positive bedtime experience- young or old. Well done, cloud b!!!"
149065,2,"Doesn't live up to the hype all these women are raving about. I've used this since I was 10 weeks preg (when I started having trouble sleeping) and I am 24 weeks now. I'm not going to stop using it because I paid +$70 for it (ugh!). I'm a back sleeper and since preggos aren't supposed to sleep on their backs, I bought this to help me get comfy trying to sleep on my sides. Nope. Not comfy."
58624,1,We purchased this because we live in Italy and the water is frequently nonpotable. This has been a great investment. I have sterilized pacifiers and hard plastic toys as well as the avent bottles. I have even used it to sterile parts of a playtex bottle that I use occasionally. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to sterize their bottles. We have a medium to small microwave and it fits fine. The box will tell you how many minutes you need to sterilize depending on different wattages. Very easy to use.
167454,0,not much down in this blanket - pretty cheaply made for the price. I should have bought the Pacific Coast Feather crib blanket instead
81980,1,"I've tried a few other milk storage systems, including the medela bags (which you can pump directly into) and the hard plastic containers (like Avent). This is, by far, the most useful and most economical storage systemm.Pros:1. The bags have a double-zip closure. This ensures that the bag seals well and doesn't leak. Also, when you push the air out, a few drops of milk always slip out, but it usually doesn't get past the second zip-closure. The bags are superior to the hard containers because you can squeeze the air out and prevent freezer burn.2. These lay flat! I put my warm bags of milk into a rectangular Tuppperware container and stack them up on top of one another. Then, I put them into the freezer, and they freeze perfectly flat, which the Medela bags don't do. Once they are frozen into flat blocks, I stack 10 blocks in a one gallon Ziploc freezer bag and label and date the Ziploc bag. This goes into the deep freeze.3. They are spacious! They recommend that you put 6oz of milk into the bag, but these bags are quite large and will definitely hold more than 6oz. As one reviewer said, they can put up to 12oz into the bag. The reason why the company says 6oz is so the bag can lay flat. Once it fills too much, it won't lay flat as well, but you can save quite a bit of money by overfiling these. The Medela bags are small in comparison, and hold 5oz at the max, and they also do not lay flat.4. They are economical. These were the most economical bags on the market, too. They fit more milk than any other bag. I use the Amazon ""subscribe and save"" option for free shipping and save another 15% off the price. I don't know how long that promotion will run. While you can't pump into the bag like you can with the Medela bags, I have found that I run out of space in the Medela bags anyway, since they only hold 5oz, and sometimes I do pump more than 5oz in one session.5. They are safe for baby. Obviously, they are sterile. They have a tear-off tab at the opening to break the seal. The plastic does not contain any chemical softeners. And, there is a tab of plastic that is away from the milk where you can write your name and date on the bag. This prevents any chemicals from your pen leaching into the milk. This is good for me, since I use a Sharpie pen, and I am sure there are chemicals that could potentially leach through the bag.6. Easy to defrost and use the milk. When I defrost, I again put the bag into a Tupperware in case of small nicks in the bags or leakage. I have not had a problem with leakage, yet.Cons:1. The one major thing that bothered me in the beginning was that the volume measurements on the bag were estimates and not accurate like the hard container storage systems. But, I just use the bottle that I pumped into to measure out my 6oz, and then pour it in. I've also gotten quite good at eyeballing 6oz on the bag.Not much else to complain about. I've been really happy with these bags, so far."
176652,0,"Let me start by saying this is a great concept. I purchased these bottles before my son, who is now 10 weeks old, was born. I planned to breastfeed exclusively. I planned to pump into these bottles. I even took a reviewers advice and got extra large bottles and short liners (which I wouldn't advise to anyone). I liked the idea of not needing to wash a million bottles. I didn't have a dishwasher at the time. (We now do... and maybe I would have stuck with these had that not been the case). I also have a psychotic cat that continually custom selected baby items from the dish drying rack. Drove me nuts.Nothing went to plan. I ended up supplementing my breast milk with formula after one month. My son eats a ton and these bottles don't really do well with formula.POWDERED FORMULAPowdered formula (which I can't stand) doesn't mix well in this bottle. Also, despite the wonderful design for keeping air out... you have to shake powdered formula. Thus, there's air in there and your baby will be gassy.LIQUID (RTF) FORMULAFormula is expensive. Pushing the air out of the bag is a GREAT concept. But when the bag exploded on me twice... I was upset. And reading reviews, I have to say I thought people were just pushing to quickly and clearly that would never happen to me. But it did. Twice. And with a screaming baby... it's really better to have bottles that are ready to go. (Even if prepared, you need to push air out of the bottle... and that takes time).BREASTMILKI don't pump enough to fill these bottles. Pumping takes a lot of time. So.. After I pump my four ounces, I don't want it to explode. And I don't want it to go bad from having so much exposure to air... And if I'm pumping, I'm not feeding my child right away. He eats all the time. Thus, I stopped ""expressing"" because it seemed to be a waste of time. Why pump into a bottle just to feed it to him right away? (I'm empty after I finish pumping). Now... in the first few weeks, my son killed my nipples. So, pumping into the bottle came in handy. The pump was much kinder. I didn't care if he destroyed silicone. (He didn't... but I'm just sayin'!).I had no problem with the lids on these bottles. I actually prefer these caps to the ""newer"" ones I found at Babies R Us (for a much higher price). The plastic is sturdy. I liked the silicone nipples because I could boil them (and now I can put them in the dishwasher). This brand is kind of wonderful because they make a variety of bottles and the nipples can be used with different bottles.I didn't hate the bottle enough to say you shouldn't try it. But I didn't like it enough to continue using it. You do not need ""extra"" exterior bottles. The set comes with enough. The comparison would be like buying a bunch of vaccuums for your vaccuum bags. Since you don't need to wash the exterior anyway... what you have is plenty."

101693,2,"This monitor was great for about a year. I had a 2 yr old ,a 1 year old and a newborn all in different rooms. Once the baby turned one, the monitor turned to pure static. Yes you can still hear the baby cry through the static, but it is so annoying! I'm trying to figure out how to contact the manufacturer for help in fixing it."
103369,1,"We installed this gate at the bottom of our kitchen staircase in an extremely high traffic area in our home. We also have two older kids, ages 3 and 6, and both can open the gate with no problem. They are constantly going in and out of it and the loud click when it closes reassures me that the gate is locked. The gate must be installed at the top of the first step such that the gate swings outward to open. I have no difficulty using one hand to press, turn and pull the latch to open. I will admit that my older children need two hands to accomplish this. We have also gotten compliments on the look and ease of use of the gate from other parents with small children who have various gates installed in their homes. Overall, we are very pleased with this gate."
58268,1,"Ever since we got the Bundleme there has always been one less blanket to cart around. The only reason to bring one is if you need to take the baby out of the car seat where it's cold enough to need a blanket. It has kept my daughter nice and warm wherever we have gone this winter, and I will continue to use it for the rest of the winter.One thing to consider, however, as the baby gets a little older, he/she might free his/her arms from the Bundleme, so a sweater might be advisable when the baby is old enough to figure out how to do this."
2403,1,papers would have been great but the wrong size. They were automatically sent and by the time I received them my son out grew them.
103307,0,"Like many, I already have two stairwell entrances w/ this gate hardwired and ready to go. W/o any notice, the spring will pop about 1.5 years in. I have been so proud of the way I cut wood and made it work that I can't see another way. For our set up, this is still about the only option on the market. We are on our 4th or 5th gate 18 months into our second child. If you are already set up, I finally had a ""duh"" moment that you only need to attach the piece w/ the twist handle. I only wish there was a way to only sell that piece. You only need 1/3 of everything in the box to replace the broken spring. It would be nice to only pay for that part. If you already have this, might as well get it; if you are a first timer, consider other options carefully first."
75353,0,"First, after reading several reviews I would like to note that most of the positive reviews are NOT for this pump, but for the previous model. The current model is an improvement in style, but a step down in quality (I own both). I'm a working mom so I use my pump 3 to 4 times a day. Other than the horribly loud noise it makes I used it successfully for about 5 months. At that point things started to go wrong, I've noticed a decrease in the suction, and occassionaly when I adjust the speed it just turns off (all I have to do to get it back on is push the power button, but the timer starts over).To recap:Extremely loud!Probably won't make it through one kid, forget about a second!Sometimes you get what you pay for, just spend the money on a better pump now!EDIT:I have changed my rating from 2 stars to 3. When I wrote the review about a month ago, I was struggling with my supply and may have been taking it out on the pump :( The suction is working fine, and it seems to have stopped doing the suddenly-turning-off thing. While I am back to being content with the pump I just can't go higher than three stars just becuase of how loud it is. I am lucky and have a really good place to pump at work, but if I didn't and needed to be discreet, this pump wouldn't work."
161669,0,"I bought 2 of these. One for our house and one for Grandma's. Mine was a total dud. When it was put together, it leaked and the frame for the sling was bent funny that it wobbled. My mother's went together just fine, never leaked and the frame snapped perfectly into place. We even used her sling after my daughter outgrew the tub. When she was sitting on her own but I felt more comfortable with her having some support, she sat on the end of the sling, and it worked perfect! So if you get one that doesn't guite work right, exchange it cause the next one might work fine. It was a great tub for the price."
137010,1,This set is one of the cutest themes for a baby girl at babiesrus today. My husband and I recently found out that we are adding another baby girl to the family and this will go great with the other theme we have (paper dolls they will be sharing a room) Please go see this in person as the set has shimering embelishments that can't be seen in photos. This is also sold at JCpenney but as with every baby bedding item they have it costs a little more for the very same item.
9010,2,"We purchased this CD player for one of our twins who is very sick in the NICU. He is very sensitive to noise and with all the talking and alarms, we thought music would give him a soothing distraction. We placed this CD player right in his isolette about 4&quot; from his head with the volume all the way up and still couldn't hear it! For that price, I returned it. It's a shame because I really think music would be nice for him but cannot find an alternative battery operated CD player."
50722,1,"I wasn't sure about this pillow when I ordered it ""sight unseen"", but I love it! It's so comfortable, and the multitude of positions you can use it in besides for sleeping(sitting, as a book rest, as a breast feeding pillow and back support) make it well worth the price. I even lug it with me on overnight trips - a must have!"
121923,1,Over all this is a very good stroller. We have a 2 1/2 year old and a one month old and this is the best way to get them to our local park. Very well built stroller.

I finally got that dresser and ALL the hardware to put it together was missing. I called Storkcraft and they express mailed the hardware to me after hearing what I had gone through. Now that we had all the hardware we are missing a board and still cannot put the dresser together.

166312,1,"Pampers are not only a great product, but I really love that they chose to make a box with 276 diapers. It makes life a little easier not having to purchase diapers on a weekly basis."
40223,1,I bought three boxes last time Amazon had the promotion on Pampers and all of them are mesh liners. I totally agree with previous reviewers that the new mesh liner is horrible. I think Pampers got back to the old liners now. Does anyone recently ordered these diapers from Amazon? I would like to find out are they mesh liners or not. Thanks.
108559,1,"The minute we opened the box i knew i made the right desicion to purchase this stroller. The weight is unbelieveable, the ride is smooth - ONE FINGER push is what it takes! My 7 mos. old baby girl looked very comfortable in it, recline is pretty good for an infant (a 2 hr nap is the proof).My previous purchase of Britax Blue Blaze (sold it on craigs list the day after we received it) was a big mistake. Spend a little more the get whole a lot. A good stroller is a good investment."
130611,1,Our daughter would not nap unless she was in this swing. She loved it. You do have to be sure a blanket is not dragging on the ground as that does slow it down. We used it with her for months. We just had a newborn and pulled it out for him. It is still working and he loves it as well - the music setting is what we use and it really calms him down. I didn't notice our daughter ever really noticing the fish part of it. Maybe because she went to sleep so fast when she was in it! :) A definite must have!
73986,0,"I have a 4 yr old ( very petite for her age) and a 4 month old and when I saw this stroller I thought - this is great! After I used it the 1st time I noticed the whole stroller pulled to the left, so I called Joovy and the man at first couldn't understand what the probblem could be but then finally they shipped me out a new one. Problem is still there , it is hard to steer with the infant seat in and a child in the back.My biggest complaint is the back seat for the older child- the seat slides back and forth so easily that my daughter has fallen out several times- very dangerous, not to mention there is barely any room for her to sit with the carrier in. The basket is so small, I cannot even fit my diaper bag in there and also no cup holder for the parents.I do not recommend this Joovy stroller, they are other sit and stand ones that are much easier to use and safer."
71903,1,"I love it! I am 5'9'' and it is perfect for me. I run about 10 miles per week and it works very well. I even roller blade with it. I bought the insert and used it when my daughter was 1 month old, she loved it. It does not protect from the sun a lot, but I used a thin sheet that a just cliped on the sides. I put my dog (13 pounds) under in the basket and she likes it too. For the money I think it is a great stroller!"

60968,2,"There are over 400 reviews here, so what can I bring to the party? Experience. Over time, the plastic in the diaper genie gradually absorbs the foul smells of its contents, so it begins to stink, empty or full. I'd say it has 2-3 months before you start noticing it, and maybe a few more before you have to decide to do something about it.Hey, this is fun: do a Google search on &quot;diaper genie bad&quot; and notice the astro-turf. The same message appears over and over in all the baby-review forums. Your friends at Playtex really want you to buy this!A brand new diaper genie, when you can figure out how to use it and to load it (both steps are really NON-intuitive), performs pretty much as advertised. The diapers are sealed in a chain of plastic bags like sausages. Emptying the thing when it is full? Catastrophe lurks at every step. Working this thing is nothing you want to do when you're tired or groggy."

44242,0,Cute design and lots of pockets. Great pull out diaper pad. The bag is a bit small and doesn't hold a lot. The sides gap unless the bag is completely full.
101630,2,"When I received the Home Connection Monitor one of the receivers had a constant and intolerable clicking sound no matter where it was placed in my home. The other receiver worked okay, other than that the volume was extremely low and there was a considerable amount of static. I was unable to hear my daughter get out of bed and leave her room even at the highest volume. Because this was the only monitor of its kind that I was able to find, I decided to give it a try despite the problems. I even went out and purchased a new cordless phone with a different frequency to eliminate any possible interference. We do not have a satellite dish or alarm system so these were not an issue. After a couple of weeks of use the one working monitor began to have periods of extremely loud static, so that nothing else could be heard through it, and this soon became constant, so that it was unusable.This is the worst quality product I have ever received and I am extremely disappointed and frustrated. Despite the numerous bad reviews and obvious problems with the product, Amazon refused to cover return shipping charges when I returned it. My advise, don't waste your time or money."
88272,2,"I am an internet shopper. I review everything before I buy it. This diaper bag seemed great after I read the reviews, but IT IS NOT! I don't require a lot of space every day, but I would like to be able to fit 2- outfits (newborn!), burp rags, bibs, and one thin blanket on the inside of my bag, without having to take all the items out to find anything. There are these long shallow pockets across the top. If you put anything in them (paci, tiny motrin bottle, cellphone), then you really can't reach into the bag below, because those top compartments are sticking out into the middle of the bag, trapping the bottom items in the bag. And the main compartment and outside pockets all have velcro, so try getting your outfits and blanket in and out without snagging them. Try putting your own arm down in there, without snagging the sleeve of your shirt or sweater. Impossible! I just absolutely hate this bag. No other way to say it. I have never reviewed anything so negatively on Amazon. Very disappointing. Maybe I can sell it for half of what I paid, so that someone who feels the way the other reviewers do can buy it!"
8569,1,"Served the purpose they were purchased for. Stone hearth on fireplace was posing danger to out new walker. Look good, great adhesive, but they don't cut easily to length."
33262,2,"First off, this product shipped from Target and they shipped the wrong color. Amazon handled the exchange well but it was an inconvenience. Second the installation instructions are not that clear. I had to use the spacers thinking that they should be directly across from one another. This is not the case as the latch catches are not on center, so when the gate is closed it is not parallel with the wall. Its not that noticable, but if you install it yourself, you are reminded of it every time you see it. The other thing is that I had to cut a board to mount the hinge side to my stair railing. The height of the gate is a lot shorter than a normal railing, so if you don't have square ballisters, plan on an additional piece you will need to make for a good installation. Overall the gate seems sturdy and my daughter loves to pull herslef up on it and look through especially if someone is on the otherside. I trust it, and I guess that is what is important."
61543,2,"Tjis monitor has some static around microwaves and phones, but over all the clarity is clear. BUT one night while baby and I were sleeping and when I woke up I realized the electricity had been off for who know how long and no sound came from the monitorm luckily the baby was ok.This monitor has battery but when the reciever is pluged into the outlet and the power goes off the monitor does also. You would think that the battery power would kick in but it doesn't it goes completely dead.So if you want to buy a 9volt battery every day so you doh't have to worry about the electricity failing, then this monitor is ok. However I am going to look for another monitor with back up battery power.Any suggestions????"
135406,1,"I purchased this monitor after our monitor died while we were on vacation. Based on reviews I chose the Graco Ultra Clear II. I wanted a monitor with two handset. Most of the monitors I looked at only came with one. This monitor has been great so far. Very clear sound, no static, and works well even when we are in the front yard. I find the night light feature helpful. The volume control could be a little better but it's a minor complaint."
156540,2,"We bought this swing for our 3-month old son so we could easily transport it to grandma's house. While it is convenient, it is NOT SAFE at all!!! My son enjoys playing with the linkadoos toys but when he tugs on them, he tips over to the sides of the seat and hangs between the leg bars. I was horrified to see that the seatbelt did not help. In order for a child to remain safely upright, the seat would require shoulder straps (just like the ones found in carseats). Also, the seat is not sturdy and causes him to slouch. I had to put burp clothes under his back to straighten out his posture. I recommend this product only for younger babies as they are not able to grasp the hanging toys and fall over."
141973,2,This product was more of a hassle then anything else. It was a pain to put on and my 10 month old at the time destroyed it. He would just tear it off and then the finish would go with it. I would stick with a cloth cover that has teething hook attachments.
13687,1,"I have a 70# dog and 8# dog, my 8# dog is pretty determined to get to my cat litterboxes and I have a cat that is unable to jump so I positioned this gate in my doorway that allows my cat to squeeze by but not my dog. it is not flimsy at all and when some of my fat cats jump over it their legs catch it and its never once tipped."
3955,0,"I decided to buy this because I started collecting my change after purchasing things and I realized that I had no place to store it. This was advertised as a slot machine coin bank so I thought that I would check it out because I didn't want to go with just another piggy bank. Do not let the pictures fool you, the entire machine is plastic including the handle. It does have a nice paint job that makes parts of it look like old metal from a distance but close up it doesn't fool anyone. As for the operation, it functions like a real slot machine with the classic three reels in the center. The handle may be plastic, but it is relatively strong. It has not bent or anything like that even after many plays. The problem is, for a bank, it really doesn't hold much change at all. This has no value as a bank whatsoever! It is definitely more for fun. The front slot holds a good bit of change as you play but it is not necessary to operate the toy. Any change that is inserted into the front slot it placed in the jackpot compartment where it will drop if you hit the correct combos that are labeled on the front of the machine. It does have a jackpot release right in the front where you collect your ""winnings"", just in case you should require that money. If you hit the jackpot, your change will drop from the slot in the front into the bottom where you can collect it and play again. There is a real bell that sounds when you win, and it works on two AA batteries. The noise from the bells and from the gears grinding during use can get rather obnoxious. It might be beneficial to skip the batteries because the machine will still function without the batteries you just won't hear the bell when you win. Overall, it definitely makes a fun toy, but if you were looking for a real bank that can hold more than five dollars in change then look elsewhere."
11383,1,"I have been using this monitor for almost two years and am fairly pleased with it. I like the light feature that shows if the baby is crying without actually having the sound up. It can have a bit of static, but I found that keeping the sound turned on the lowest level with still being able to hear the baby takes care of it. I have not had any problems with picking up radio stations or monitors. It is pretty sensitive to noise, however--another reason to use the lowest possible volume setting. The receivers are a bit lightweight and tend to knock over easily. This is the first set of monitors I tried and I was pleased enough to keep them--I can't compare them with similar products. If you are looking for a decent priced set of monitors that work fairly well, this is a good choice."
242,1,"I used Cruisers with my first daughter and never had any problems, but she was never prone to diaper rash.When my second came along I was sure I'd use Cruisers for her as well. I started her on Swaddlers and had no problem but as soon as we switched to Cruisers she started getting horrible, painful diaper rashes. I was sure it couldn't be our beloved Cruisers. So I tested it by putting her in Baby Dry and Huggies and every time I did, it would clear up. As soon as I put her back in the Cruisers, she'd get it again.So we switched to Baby Dry and haven't had any problems. She is a super-soaker and drinks a ton of fluid and we've never had a leak.Just recently, my husband accidentally bought a pack of Cruisers while on vacation. I figured since she was older (19 months) that maybe she's outgrown her sensitivity to the Cruisers, but as soon as we put her in them, the rash started up again.So, if you have a baby with sensitive skin, definitely try out the Baby Dry."
118420,0,"I like this tub, but I don't think it is the best option for a newborn. I like it better between 3-6 months of age. The plastic is quite hard, so you have to line it with wash cloths to make it softer. As soon as my son is able to sit up on his own, I won't be using it. As I said earlier, I like it best for ages 3-6 months, so I ended up getting a different tub for when he was first born. I just felt like he wasn't as secure in this tub as in others I have tried. It was hard to wash his back in the tub before he had head control. I also feel like this is better for a little girl as the male anatomy gets in the way when they straddle it."
39278,1,"It is a great and easy to use stroller. It appears to be build well, so hopefully it lasts a long time, unlike our last double stroller"
115710,2,"I purchased this stroller after the McClaren hinge recall to try a different brand in a lightweight, less expensive model for travel. This stroller was mangled in just one airplane flight, and while I could blame United Airlines, the fact that my husband was able to bend the stroller so easily to try and fix it tells me it's just poorly made. And no, it wasn't fixable. Even in full working order if you are above 5'7"" you will have to hunch over to push this stroller and somehow the pitch of it is such that your feet will knock into the wheels when pushing it. I've never loved my old McClaren so much, and I will even risk finger amputation to use it once again."
16215,1,"LOVE this blanket. I take can take it anywhere I go and it's very easy to clean. We have used it at the park, at the beach, and it was great when were on vacation. We put it on the floor in our hotel room and our daughter used it as a play mat as it is rather large - folds up nicely for travel or storage.I've given several as gifts - moms with infants or toddlers just love receiving it."

31996,1,Ive been looking for fun and vibrant sheets for my sons crib and im glad to find these. I was worried if they would be an odd size or something and maybe not fit and be too small but they fit great. I have the davinci kalani crib from target and its a larger sized crib so these sheets will fit any crib you should have. The fabric is soft and well made. I love this zig zag pattern it looks so cool and modern!
15135,0,"The Diaper Genie II does a great job of controlling the odor of dirty diapers, but since it uses its own special bags, you have to continually buy refills! At nearly $7/refill (which doesn't last very long), you go broke buying refills! Get the Diaper Champ, which works just as well but accepts standard (cheap) trash bags."
121892,2,"This cover is just that, a cover. It provides zero warmth and barely acts as a barrier between the cold and your baby. The paperwork included with the cover even instructs you not to rely on the cover for warmth and to dress your baby for the weather. I had hoped to use this while on a recent trip to canada as strollers are impossible on the snow and ice covered sidewalks. This was a huge disappointment."

124801,0,"I am using Playtex Ventaire and Dr Browns bottles. I used stage 1 nipples for my newborn son and he was choking as the milk flow was too fast. I was able to use these nipples only after he was 3 months old and its working pretty good. It was nice that the nipples fit perfectly on the Playtex Ventaire bottles as the ones I used initially are slow flow and per the reviewers that fast flow nipples were too fast for their babies.Pros1. Fits Ventaire bottles.2. Does not collapse while feeding3. NOT made in China, says made in Germany.Cons1. Stage 1 nipples hard to find in the store unless buying the bottles too.2. I think it caused nipple confusion once introduced but I realised late so will definitely get the wide neck bottles with nipples next time."
40634,0,"We love Pamper Cruisers. As a mother of twins, we have had to try to find the best diapers. Pampers may be more expensive, but they don't leak. I would rather pay more for a diaper than have to keep buying cclothes becasue they are destroyed."
4472,1,"I bought this item when my son was 4 months old. His legs were so strong and he loves to kick them. He loved this item immediately. I had never seen him so happy as when he is used this. He is 6 months old now and is in it at least 3 times a day for anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. He smiles and laughs and loves to do different jumps or just swing himself. It tires him out, too, before his naps or bedtime. He had reflux until he was 6 months so I would always wait an hour after he ate to put him in it and there was never much spit up. This is by far his favorite toy!"
110259,1,"We purchased this glider for the upcoming birth of our first baby. The cherry color is beautiful, and matches our Delta crib perfectly. The construction of the glider is top-notch, and it glides so smoothly and feels very sturdy. There is plenty of room in the chair for me and baby. As an added bonus, the ottoman is amazing! I can't believe it is included with the chair! This is a glider I would recommend to any of my friends, as it is well constructed and feels so comfortable when you're sitting in it. On top of this, shipping was quick and free, so who can beat that!?"
73227,2,"I purchased four of these for my children (ages 2-4). After using them for a few months we have had a variety of issues. The plastic on the bottom of all of the cups has cracked. One of the straws ripped apart. Also, the plastic hinge broke off. After contacting Thermos they said that there is a five year warranty on the cups ONLY if they haven't been dropped. These are made for kids right?"

93231,1,"I was in desperate need of a travel bed for an upcoming trip, but I was worried about the negative reviews regarding the ""bar"" on this bed. Totally not what I experienced. There is not even a fabric band on the middle of the bed- there are X supports at the top and bottom (underneath, with nylon webbing) but nothing is uncomfortable.In fact, it's exactly what I needed for my five-year-old, 40 lb daughter. Fits her perfectly and I can't wait to use it on our trip.And it's SO easy to set up- you just push on the end pieces are BAM it's done!"
83709,1,"Hallelujah! I had the hardest time in the beginning breastfeeding my daughter. She didn't latch correctly but yet had a very firm latch, so she literally took skin off of my nipples. Obviously it was extremely painful. I would wince in pain when she latched on, but once she was on it was ok. I freaked out after I saw blood near her head in her crib, but it was my blood from my nipples dripping out of her mouth! Aack! So I finally got a clue and saw a lactation consultant. Thank God for that profession. I showed her my nipples and she said that other women would have quit breastfeeding by then. But I was determined to breastfeed. She introduced me to these nipple shields, and I started using them right away. What a difference it has made! No more pain and baby and I are both happy as can be nursing! I now own 5 of these, I wash them periodically with soap and water and keep them in a Ziploc bag. It's handiest for me to wash them while I am showering. I keep two in a Ziploc bag in my diaper bag in case I forget to bring the other ones, which has happened.The lactation consultant initially told me to eventually discontinue them when my daughter learned to latch correctly, but I am still using them and plan to do so the entire time I nurse because my pre-nipple shield experience was extremely painful.I only wish I found them sooner, and I recommend them to any mother that is experiencing latching problems or inverted nipples. They truly are a wonderful product that I could not live without."
123114,1,"The size is good, easy to use! We bought this as a downstairs solution for our crawling daughter to hang in while I make dinner. The size is good (rectangular) and it is easy to just fold up and put in a coat closet.I am happy with it, just wish I would have bought it before 9 1/2 months! She now just wants to get out of it!"
129928,1,We actually had to buy a couple extra bases for each of our cars and the sitters too.
121790,0,"As a first time Mom who really wanted to breast feed I've tried almost every nursing pillow out there. There are certainly pros and cons to all of them. In the end I found that nursing pillows are certainly not ""one size fits all"". Tons of positive reviews from others do not necessarily mean that a particular pillow will work for you. I tried everything from the boppy, to My Brest Friend, to different shaped regular bed pillows, before finding the Bosom Baby from Luna Lullaby which worked best for me.Here's what I like about he boppy..-No doubt about it, its certainly a multi-tasker. As other reviewers here have mentioned, it can be used for many things as baby ages and even beyond.-It comes with an EASILY removable and washable cover. Surprisingly, not every nursing pillow does.Here's what I didn't like.-For me the bobby did not elevate baby enough to make nursing comfortable. I still felt I needed to lean forward when nursing which wasn't comfortable at all.-The C shape isn't easy to put around you unless you have a pretty small waste."
137110,1,"Over-all these are pretty good bottles. The only thing that I feel could use some improvement is the shape of the top of the bottle, it's a little bit too wide. Example: When you get to end of feeding and have to tilt the bottle upward to get the last 1/2 ounce or so, the base of the nipple is actually touching babies nose.Other than that, these are GREAT bottles. They are resonably priced, never had any problems w/ leaking & absolutely LOVE that cap snaps onto bottom of bottle, GENIUS!"
40011,1,"We purchased this for our 22 month old daughters because they weren't sleeping through the night. Between cars going by our house, the neighbor's dog barking, and the tv the noises were waking them up.My husband chose this because of the different settings and the ""mixing"" of sounds. You can mix the sound of the ocean with a seagull or the sound of rain with thunder. There is even the sound of the womb for little ones. If you don't want to run this all night there is a timed setting which kicks the machine off after an hour.Ever since we purchased this our girls have slept so much better! I would highly recommend this for those parents that need to have some sort of ""white noise"" for their little ones to sleep."

41005,0,"Has anyone else had problems with the changes in Pampers diapers the past few months? A few months ago, we purchased a few of the economy-sized packs, as we usually do, from our local BRU. The material was changed on the area that the tabs secure to! I was disappointed because the superior ""holding power"" was the reason we always chose Pampers over Huggies (which we get more and better coupons for). I contacted customer service through the web site, and was informed it was a glitch in their manufacturing process, which was corrected. They were kind enough to send some coupons for free diapers. HOWEVER, the next few packages we bought...same thing. I bought Huggies for about 6 weeks, and decided last week to try Pampers again. Surely, the ""duds"" were out of circulation by that time. Nope! Bought the box, and again...same problem. Is this problem only in the Northeastern Ohio area? Or, I wonder, did the customer service representative fib just to appease me when the diapers have been permanently changed?THREE MORE E-MAILS AND I GOT TWO RESPONSES FROM THE ""PAMPERS TEAM"". ONE STATING IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHICH STORES STILL HAVE THE DEFECTIVE PACKAGES (HMMM...MY UNDERSTANDING WAS MANUFACTURERS COULD TRACK THIS BY CERTAIN NUMBERS). PLUS, IS IT LIKELY THAT B'RU HAS THE SAME DIAPERS ON THE SHELF FROM 5 MONTHS AGO???? THE OTHER ""PAMPERS TEAM MEMBER"" REPLIED THAT THE TEAM WASN'T AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, SHE WOULD INFORM THEM, AND INSINUATED IT WAS, PERHAPS, DUE TO SOMETHING ON MY PART (HAND LOTION, ETC.). THE STRIP THAT THE TABS ADHERE TO IS NOT AS FUZZY, HOW CAN THAT BE CAUSED BY HAND LOTION/WRONG SIZE/ETC.?THEY ARE BOTH FOLLOWING UP BY MAIL, SINCE E-MAIL ""LIMITS"" WHAT THEY CAN DO. BUT, WHY DO I WANT MORE COUPONS FOR A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, IF THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE TRYING AGAIN? POOR, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT P & G/PAMPERS. HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE ELSE...MAYBE YOU CAN AT LEAST GET COUPONS FOR DEFECTIVE DIAPERS!"
42485,2,"Ok my husband and I both have engineering degrees and we could not get this thing to work. Maybe we were analyzing it too much?? When we did get close, we put our newborn baby in and I was not pleased with how much it covered her face. It's a shame that these are so expensive just for us to figure out it didn't work for us. We bought a Baby Bjorn and love it - much easier to use.Also, the moby is SOOOOO long I don't see how you could feasibly put this on in a parking lot or store without it getting covered in dirt and grime. We are not fans of the moby wrap."

104361,1,The purchase of this gate was to separate some pets from one another & has proven to be a perfect solution. The installation was quick & simple & the product is well built & sturdy. The auto-close feature of the gate is ideal & the ability to open the gate in either direction is of great advantage when moving through this section of the house. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a gate for whatever purpose they see fit.
59940,1,"This tub is worth every penny! It is large, but I keep it under the crib where it's out of the way and easily accessed. The best thing about this tub is how it holds a small baby in place while you bathe him or her. My baby is 4 weeks old but I'm sure I'll continue to like it as he grows."

The worst thing is, this morning my baby tapped the handle and the handle just fell apart from the bottle! I tried to push the handle back to its position but it loose again and again. This 9-day life bottle is the worst baby product I baught ever."
183275,0,"We've been using this bassinet for 4 months now and plan to continue using for a few more at least. It sits beside my side of the bed. We have it on the lowest position, which is still a bit higher than our bed. Nothing I would really complain about. Getting the bassinet, my biggest concern was the mattress, but I find it really really fine. Based on the reviews I read here, I was worried about it being too hard and too thin, but it's really fine. No problems there. I did buy a very soft bassinet sheet and I use that over the sheet it came with. That's just personal preference though. I wanted really soft sheets. I really really love the rocking feature. With my first son, we used a pack and play. And my two biggest complaints with that were that I couldn't rock him, you more have to shake it, which is not so easy to do at 3am. And I think the space is too much in a pack and play when they're so tiny. I think (and my experience of two kids has shown) that they sleep better in a slightly more confined space. They've gone from this tight tight space and then we throw them to sleep in this huge thing with all this space around them. Um, no. So, I love the rocking. My biggest complaint, and the reason this is getting 3 stars, is the footing of the bassinet. It sticks out A LOT. And it's awkward the way it sticks out. My husband says to give it 2. I would give it 4, so I split the difference. You can see it in the picture. It's an unexpected way that those legs stick out. I'd say an extra two full inches on each side and it has been tripped over many times, with the baby in the bassinet, or the baby in our arms. Either way, you have to be extra careful. So, I wouldn't say it's a reason not to get this. I did extensive research, and found this to be the best one out there. But I would definitely want to be aware of this issue and to remain extremely careful."
76220,0,After trying sever different options I found one that really works and this is not it. Silicone is much safer and last longer and easier to use. A better solution is Wilton Bite-Size Brownie Squares 24-Cavity Silicone Mold Pan. If you search for Silicone molds there are more options. Having a bit of space makes them freeze faster and much easier to remove from the pan. These are just ice cube trays with covers. Not worth the extra money.

The bottle was tiny (I should have checked the size before I brought, but I figured at just over $10, there would be more in a bottle than there was.) and although the quality seems okay, I didn't think that the bubbles lasted any longer than my preferred product.I won't be buying this again due to its high price.

They definitely do the trick in helping your baby sleep through the night, or to help with fussiness. Right now my baby is 4 months, and I still swaddle her for bedtime. She absolutely loves the secure feeling of these swaddles, and it is also nice that they come in a size large, so I can continue to swaddle her at bedtime through her first year."
113143,1,Medela medela why must you be so greedy? Be careful I bought the medela accessorie pack at baby's r us for $30. Then these nipple shields for 11.

95510,1,This product shipped super quickly and it took only minutes to set up! We love it and no longer have stuffed animals all over the bed.
21380,1,We gave this to our grandson for his birthday and he loved it and so did the other kids at his party.
134374,1,"I have never had a problem with this warmer, It keeps the wipes nice and warm, my daughter is no longer startled by cold wipes. Any pop up wipes work, I have used pampers, luvs, huggies. they all did the job. The water was not a problem, and the pad that goes on the bottom is washable. I do recommend this product to everyone."
86893,2,"I ordered this for our upcoming travel so I don't have to bring my bottle sterilizer with me,I ordered this bottles for my baby boy, and voila!!! they sent me a PINK, YELLOW and VIOLET Bottle Arrghh!!! very disappointing :(("
17527,0,"We just ordered this item from on-line and I am discouraged to see how low it sits at the highest setting. It is not convenient for us because we usually eat at a high table in the kitchen. I assumed it would be high enough. I am only 5'4'' and the tray comes about 5-6 inches below my hip. Why is it so low? Great for the dining room table, but not comfortable for the kitchen table. It also is a bit of a stretch to feed her if I am standing (as I often do). I called ToysRus to attmept to exchange it, but was told I will have to do it on line since Toys and BabiesRus are now seperate - what a pain in the neck!"
134702,2,"This product is not that great as far as exersaucers go- we replaced a few of the toys for more exciting ones. At least evenflo makes replacements. The main complaint I have is that the flip book that comes with this seems to always get little fingers caught in it. My 6 month old daughter loves to turn the pages (and chew on them) but she would always get the side of her fingers caught. This lead to numerous tears and we finally took that toy off. The other thing is that she sometimes just sits in the exersaucer, not playing. I don't think it stimulates her enough. If I had to do it again, I would buy a better model. This one just isn't that great."
164141,1,"This was a great buy for me at a good price. My 3 month old loves in sleep with it, in fact she is able to sleep longer with it. It makes her car seat more comfortable when she has to be in for longer periods of time. Her head is still round and I am thinking of buying another one so I don't have to keep taking it out of the car seat to put it in the bouncer or swing!"
67695,2,"I didn't like this cup holder at all. I have a valco stroller (and like it) and I couldn't get the cup holder tight on the stroller. It's not easy to get a coffee cup in and out either. I know there has to be a better cup holder out there. Additionally, I hardly think since it doesn't fit on a Valco stroller that it could even remotely be considered universal. Poorly played, valco."
64338,1,"I looked at many packs before deciding on this one. I was hesitant at frist due to some of the reviews saying it was uncomfortable. Well it was at first. Then I adjusted ALL the straps while wearing it of course, including the shoulder straps and now it fits perfectly. Snug against my torso just like a regular hiking pack.Love all the little accessories, too!"
159396,1,I received this item for my son before he was born. It really comes in handy when you are the only one home nad want to take a shower or washing dishes and your baby can see you. The music and different sounds it makes. My son isnt to fond of the vibrating but it is a great purchase.
57224,1,"My 9 month old seemed very comfy while adjusting to fit him (the harness adjuster is incredibly easy). Big shocker when I tried to install though, it would not sit level rear facing in our Suburban. It fit foward facing only w/ the base off, but even then it was unsteady. It's a very nice seat, just be sure to try it first!"
75618,1,"We read all of the bad reviews on this product, and will admit that we had some concerns. However, the product arrived well packaged, and was the color we expected as a true espresso. For the price you cannot beat it, and if people complained about the number of parts and difficulty in assembly just ignore them. If you have any patients at all then this will be easy. yes, there are a lot of parts, but the extra parts are what will add reliability and structural integrity to the product. Example being two wooden dowels and a screw in each aft corner of the drawer. I would say that it took me 2.5 hours to assemble. The unit is solid, great color, and looks of high quality. I certainly recommend this product and had not trouble at all. If you are impatient and get frustrated easily, then I would recommend buying an assembled product from a furniture store. Quality, Price, Ease of assembly, all receive an A in my book."
133932,0,"This is a nice warmer and sends a sample of the ""fresh pad"" that keeps the wipes moist. It does the job of warming the wipes.But (and I saw this on another review) I've been using Huggies pop-up wipes, and I've had problems with the lid on this warmer. Either the entire lid raises up when I pull out a wipe and I have to constantly push it back down, or the rubber ""dispenser hole"" where the wipes come out disengages and I have to readjust it, which is a huge pain.I'd buy the product again, but it would be much better if the lid was designed differently."
152221,2,This stopped working after two months. I bought a second one because my son loved it. This one stopped working after a month. DO NOT BUY!!!!!
172568,2,"I bought this tub because of the shower feature. The shower is more like a tiny trickle that makes it difficult to rinse soap quickly. Also, I have a long baby who had to fold himself up like a pretzle to fit in the tub when the shower is in place. I took the shower feature out to make more room and use a cup to rinse him off.My little guy is now 4 months old and is way too big to have a bath in this tub. I thought it was a great idea, but I have not been that pleased."
72822,2,"It is a nice thermometer and worked fine, but given the battery is not replaceable, it's not worth to buy it.Ours lasted about 8 weeks. Additionally, the glass window started to steam up after 6 weeks. (may be that was the root cause, but anyways, a bath thermometer should be sealed properly.)"
32428,1,Great product - is perfect for most any staircase including ones where the banister and wall do not match up. We use the y spindle attachment to have this as a tension mount instead of in wall. Sturdy enough for 3 toddlers to pull on it without collapsing even when tension mounted. would recommend to use with y spindle and extension kit.
98551,0,"I own a Saturn SC1...yes, a small car. However, I was able to fit my Graco Snugride in it with no issues, except no passengers could fit in the front seat bc of the recline of the carseat. I got used to this and was even willing to do this with my great new Britax seat. HOWEVER, I jusy spent 2 frustrating hours trying to install this annoying seat that is all great if you have a car that doesn't have BUCKET seats (took SEVEN noddles to get it to sit properly and a no slip &lt;kitchen cabinet liner> strip to keep the base in place)! The size of the car doesn't seem to be the issue...it's the seat and all it's upposed great features. This seat would be awesome in a car that had perfectly flat seats with the latch system! I on the otherhand, have the tether system. I read the instruction manual front to back and started the install (even though I've been thru 3 sessions with the EMS station locally to learn how to properly install my other seat and had ZERO problems!). The instruction inform you to simply pull the tether bag up for use later, I did this. After doing, undoing, doing, and doing the belt to get it perfectly fit with base, belt, etc. I went to take the tether out and attach it....well, to mt surprise the tether CLIP is all the way under the seat bc it doesn't explain to make sure the CLIP is loose and free before installing the lap belt portion! SOOOOO, I gave up till tomorrow bc my hands hurt and I had broken ALL my nails trying to just get the belt installed. I think the issue with carseats is that they don't accomodate for the bucket seats. I realize I have everything going against me with my style of car, but come on...Graco wasn't this much of a problem. For the price of this seat I thought it would install itself! I got my Graco installed alone several times (for practice) even at 8.5 months preggers and I can't even install this thing with no gut! Save your money unless you have a beast to put this thing in, with flat seats, middle seat available, and lots o' room and PATIENCE! I gave it 3 stars bc I hope it will be better in my other car, but I ran out of patience to try it! I didn't even bother rear facing it bc it was even more of an issue. Lets just hope my dd actually likes this seat! Good luck if you spend this kind of money!"
148294,1,"Very simple, very economical and it fits small babies. We started poty traning our son at 5 months and he loves to be on the poty. The splashguard protects well. It is easy to clean - overall full satisfaction!"
65104,1,"Having previously had a rear facing childseat, using the Britax Roundabout was a breeze. Installing seat was easy, especially since we use the clips in our vehicle rather than a seat belt. The push button hooks make securing and releasing a snap, rather than having to fight with the old style clips without push-button release. We only use the seat forward facing, but I think the seat would also do well rear facing. I wouldn't say our daughter loves the seat, but she tolerates it much more than her old one. The seat sits her up much more upright than others. Some may be hesitant to purchase due to the price, but this seat is worth the money."
135371,1,"We tried two different monitors from Walmart which we returned and then tried these. They work far better than the other models we tried! We have a two story home that is about 2,000 square feet, and haven't had any issues with static or noise interference. Highly recommended!"
33419,0,well it has a great price and it looks sturdy but it doesn't hang well to the wall my 9 month old just push through it and he is free to go anywhere. It doesn't lock well into its place. I am still using it but if you can find something for the same price that locks better that would be great.
127313,1,We order the crib for baby #2 early so we haven't actually used it with baby yet but it's very attractive and assembly wasn't overly complicated. Very comparable to the $500 one we bought for baby #1 and it's great that it comes with the toddler rail so you don't have to buy a separate rail set if you don't want to turn it into a full bed.
57503,2,"I put this on my baby registry for my first born. After having her home from the hospital for a month, I became very unhappy with this changing pad. My baby had very loose stools (from a strictly breast milk diet) and she soiled this pad close to every changing. I kept having to wash the cover. My girl friend recommended to me another changing pad on the babiesrus website called the ""Contoured Changing Pad"" that has a permanent plastic cover on it (that allows for a wipe clean surface). I got one and found it to be worlds better than the E-Z pad. In fact I now have two of them, one for upstairs and one for down."
20285,1,"I've used all kinds of different bottles over the years from cheap Wal-Mart Specials to Avent and Dr Browns and these bottles are much closer to the higher end than the lower. Here is a break down of what I like and don't like.Pros:-Baby doesn't seem to have much gas after using these.-It is very easy to clean the inside since both the top and the bottom come off.-They are very easy for both me and my baby to hold.Cons:-Since the top and bottom do come off there are 5 pieces to clean for each bottle, so it takes up a lot of room in the dishwasher.-The nipples seem a little faster than most others I've tried, so at first my baby made a big mess when using these because she wasn't used to fast flow.-The nipples and tops are very close looking to the Avent bottles, so sometimes I put the wrong ones on one or the other and they leak.So to summarize, I would get these bottles again and other than perhaps the Avent bottles, since they have less pieces to clean, these are my favorite that I've used."
71942,1,"First of all I want to say the ONLY reason I give this seat a 4 out of 5 stars is b/c of the size. This thing is huge. However, I do like the design and safety features and after reading all the reviews and comparing it to other infant seats, I feel the best about this one. I had an older graco one that was a lot smaller but this one has way more padding and the fabric is easier to clean. I really am super happy with this purchase, it just takes up a lot of room in our van!"
78362,0,"I just bought this booster today and should have read these online reviews before heading to the store. I have a 10 month old girl, average size ( 18 1/2 lbs ) and the tray already squishes her tummy, unfortunalty it does not have tray adjustments to accomodate a growing child. I can't imagine that she will fit in it in a few months. Also, when you take the tray off, you have to push it toward the child with a bit of force, and in my case, squishing my baby's tummy more! After reading the reviews, I am upgrading (for 5$ more dollars!) to the Fisher Price Healthy booster seat. Its worth the extra few dollars after reading the online rave reviews!"
5375,1,Playtex spill-proof cups are worth their weight in gold to any parent with toddlers. The cup is only as good as the valve though. I had 2 cups that were pretty much useless without working valves. I was so happy to not have to throw these cups away. I ordered 2 packs as more valves are surely to go bad over time.
9877,1,"I like it but like the Smart potty by BabyBjorn better. Its smaller and more easily stored away. Other than that this one is easy to use as well, inside comes out and outside easy to clean as well. it's just so big and my son seems to prefer the smart potty as well."
142442,2,"The bed rails we purchased broke on the 3rd night! I couldn't believe it! A piece of thin metal bent when i was trying to pull out the rails. then, when i was going to take off the rail to see if I could bend it back into place, the fastener that holds the straps in place flew off! I was very disappointed and wished I had purchased something different!"
100894,1,"These diapers are so far so good for my three month old baby. He hasn't leaked any poop so far from them (fingers crossed) but sometimes he does get wet. Overall, though, it's something that I would recommend."
24355,1,"This is the third gate we have purchased--- And the best at that. It is easy to install, and easy to add an extension, is sturdy, and simple as pie to open and close.I recommend this gate to anyone who thinks that there current gate has flaws. Because, this one has absolutely no flaws."
120622,1,"As a Physical Therapist, I knew I would need some extra support to stay on my feet helping patients. That was 4 pregnancies and 2 garments ago. Each of my Cradles have been loaned to friends, and wear well through 3 pregnancies!Once I hit 4 months pregnant, I really appreciate the support it gives me. Other, smaller straps just didn't contain my tummy, and I like that I can just slide it up or down as my activity requires. Occasionally I get impatient with the shoulder straps, but when I am REALLY big (after 30wks) the straps are indispensible."
81455,1,"I have a full size stroller and a super light weight umbrella. I was looking for a something in between to keep in the car for errands etc. The size is great. Easy fold, HUGE basket. Not the best for long walks because it is a little bit of a bumpy ride, but fine for smooth surfaces like market and mall. I wish it had shoulder straps aka 5 point harness. My baby leans forward to see the world and I would like her to not be so far forward that her face is right on the tray. Also, the shade doesn't fold all the way forward, so if you are walking towards the sun there isn't much you can do about it...but again, for errands that is less of an issue than walks. To recline it you need both hands, but that hasn't been an issue for me. It seems really comfortable for baby. I will say that my Uppa Baby Umbrella is the best stroller I have found. She loves to kick her feet as she gets pushed along, it is VERY small and light weight, reclines all the way back, and the shade pulls all the way forward. But, they are two different strollers for two different needs. Overall I am happy with the stroller and am hoping that as she gets bigger the 5 point harness won't matter as much."
123341,1,"I bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter who loves to roll over and move around. It's very portable, easy to open and close and big enough for her activities. She is entertained by the attached toys and, on a recent overnight visit, she slept through the night in it. Being portable it seems a little shaky, but it is a safer, more comfortable play area."
74480,1,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FORPERFECTTHANK YOU FOR PROMPT DELIVERY
147620,2,"I bought the 0-6 months size for my newborn. For about a month, it was always falling in her face (which she hated). Then suddenly, It would fit her, but the bottom band is too small for her head! This hat is cute, it matches her bundleme and it's very warm and fluffy, but she can't wear it!What a waste."
30070,1,This is a great product. I had 2 boys with colic and couldn't have lived without this product. It seemed to help with the gas pains. I would highly recommend this to a friend and have bought this item for many friend's baby showers.
109908,1,"Bought this for my 2 year old daughter. She moved to a big girl bed to get ready for a new baby. It's easy to assemble, easy to use, and is almost the full length of her twin bed. Perfect for keeping her safe at night."
38041,0,I bought this in a pinch. The comforter is not perfectly rectangular. It is lopsided. The patchwork is crooked. I think I may have gotten a messed up one but I paid just $30 for it so I cant really complain too much.
34111,1,"I have one year old twins and was traveling overseas without my husband so my mother came along for the flight. When we got to the airport we found out that we were going to have to check the carseats planeside. We thought this would be an issue, having several bags and the babies and a stroller to cart around, but these bags were fantastic. We just put them on like a backpack and off we went. They were very comfortably padded and I would recommend them to anyone. I do have to say though that I am six foot tall and I was still knocking into some things because of the size of the pack."
84236,1,"Gift for mother of one, expecting 2nd child. So excited she can hardly wait to use, so I cannot review the USE of this stroller, but can say that it looks like the Mercedes of strollers."
99247,1,"I've been very frustrated with diapers specifically the leaks we have had in just about brand we have tried. Our latest experience was with the Pampers Cruisers the old and dry max version just released. No matter what we tried we had leaks mostly at night. I did call Pampers and they admitted in changing the padding on the cruisers and the new version with dry max would give us what we needed; however, in trying these the leaks were the same. Now our neighbor has the same cruisers and they are having better luck but they are making purchases in stores versus online but I wouldn't think production would be different.Now that same neighbor didn't have a good experience with Pampers Baby Dry as we did so I'm thinking some of it is based on the padding and how your child sleeps. Our daughter tends to sleep with her rear facing upward so I'm thinking the leaks are from that sometimes. These diapers are great, fit her very nicely, and we love the tabs on these as well. I want to note that we have had ZERO leaks with the baby dry diapers so we are extremely satisfied."
96129,0,"I've had this for my son since he was born and I am always short on space. I can hold a few smaller items, bottles, diapers, travel wipes, etc., but don't expect to get much more than that. There is a wipes container built in, but ours hasn't stayed closed on it's own since we bought it and it is kind of a pain to continue to fill and then replace when they dry out. My son loves the Gerber lil' crunchies (we call them baby cheetos), but it is too bulky to fit directly in this bag without bulging way out. We also pack a separate bag for my son whenever we travel anywhere for more than a day. There's no way to pack more than one change of clothes in this. It looks cool, but has some shortcomings."
28543,2,"I just received this chair the other day in cherry with the beige seat. My husband was so excited to start putting it together until we realized that three bolts on the bottom of the gilder were stripped, and one was missing. Also beige is not exactly what I would conceder the color to be, closer to a very light tan with a grayish color, it is more a dirty beige. The seat itself is also a bit thinner then i would like so needless to say I have concerns on how well it will hold up over this next year or so. We will be exchanging this item and hope that the next one will be better made since i really do not want to offend my mother in law at this point. If the next one has the same problems with the stripped and missing bolts then i will be looking into a different brand.Update: Sent the old broken one back to Amazon and Amazon shipped a new one to me very fast. Thankfully this one didn't have the problems like the last one did. Almost 7 months pregnant i was able to put the glider together by myself and it was very easy. Well everything except for the snaps for the arm rest covers, getting those to stay on took more time then putting the whole thing together. I am still worried about the thickness of the seat, i have also discovered that the fabric is itchy and that the seat is not very wide, i would not recommend this chair for someone who is on the heavy side."
27261,0,"I wanted a top sheet for the toddler bed and was going to make them out of a bottom sheet but then found these. After much debate due to the cost, I bought two. I plan to keep them because they work and they are for the grandchildren that stay occasionally. They are somewhat thin and short. The colors are good and soft but still not worth the price."
69665,1,"I do recommend this product.is soft and water-resistant ,easy ti clean.I would buy it again. And you can buy a reg sized cover for it and it fits nice."
133867,1,We own both this and the Baby Bjorn potty and my kids prefer the toilet trainer. My son takes puts this on and off the potty himself and he is very proud when he knows he can do it himself. I would also recommend buying the Bjorn step stool so your child can climb on and off the potty themselves. Very sanitary and easy to clean (I've even stuck ours in the dishwasher).
154167,2,"I am laughing hysterically from reading the other reviews which are referriing to the awful smell these wipes contain. I know EXACTLY what you mean and cannot understand why there were so many positive reviews and they do not mention this or, even stranger, they actually state these are unscented - definitely not true. Perhaps it is because I switched from Huggies Natural Care, which I liked very much, and they did not have a bad odor. I just wanted to try something more eco-friendly and cost effective, but 7th Generation's wipes are too thin and too malodorous to make it worth it. I am switching back and will be giving away the rest of this case of wipes I purchased. I would feel bad about selling these to someone else."
54714,1,"I also bought a mobile that matched my baby's room decor. But you had to wind it and the music only played for a minute or two and the the animals were pastel and didnt catch my baby'e eye. This mobile will engage your child for hours! It plays beautiful classical music for 15 minutes and there's no winding! Plus it has so many movements, my baby loves it. Even though it clashes with the decor, I know now that that doesnt matter! Its what baby likes, not what looks cute! Dont waste your money on anthing else. This is the best!"
90682,1,I have tryed every diaper that is out there and by far these are the best diapers for the price.
127931,2,"I actually wish I did like this brush! The concept is good but the execution isn't in my opinion. I DO like the suction on the bottom, but that's it.This bottle brush will fit in standard size bottles, you just have to push it in a little harder. I use these on my Dr. Brown's (standard size) bottles. Gross, I know, but there have been a few times where we came across a used bottle we didn't know was missing (fell behind something, or my other child took of with it...). When I went to clean it this brush hardly cleaned the bottom at all, especially around the rounded edges of the bottom of the bottle. Because the brush is such a tight fit and the bristles are very hard, you can't angle it, it's up and down motions only.The thing I hate most about this brush? Pulling it back out of the bottle. The bristles all get compressed to fit back through the bottle neck and then snap back into place literally spraying you with soapy, dirty bottle water."
130489,1,Great swing! Side to side (great for newborns) and front to back... lots of soothing sounds/music. Perfect for my little princess...she LOVES watching the little fishies go round the nifty little light - it really helps put her to sleep when she's tired and it's very entertaining when she's awake.
91687,1,My daughter is 12 weeks old and absolutely loves this item. She has stayed calm and happy for a long time just looking and playing with it. I recommend this very highly. It seems to be pretty durable since she is starting to grab the toys and try to pull them to her. The music is not too loud for those of us that get tired of hearing the music and it changes enough that you don't hear the same song over and over.
116545,1,"I haven't use this bag and I love the space, the color, just everything with the bag and best of all I got it on sale which I am glad I waited to purchase. I see myself not just using this bag for my son, but for myself. I will review again once I am actually using the bag. I am super excited about this bag. I hope you all will be as well."
171217,1,"I like this tub a lot. We bought it mainly because it has the hammock for newborns. As first time parents who were already nervous giving our baby a bath, I have to say that the hammock made us feel really at ease giving our baby her first baths."
37851,0,"It's been 1yr. now, and at first I thought this kit was the bomb. But the only items I regularly use are the baby-hair-brush and the nail clippers. You can buy both of these seperately & I would have if I knew I'd not use the rest of the kit! I do highly recommend the Nail Clippers from this manufacturer, they have seen much use over 1 year's time and they still work great.Tried using the Thermometer but it was very difficult to use - bought a better one for very little money AND we ended up getting an ear-thermometer anyway, as for the medicine spoon & dropper, (as any doctor will affirm) it is important to use the medication dropper provided WITH any medicine you purchase (I did not know this as a new-mom previously)."
180151,1,"I use an electric pump when I am at home, but am a wedding planner and am often on the go. I needed something small that I could bring with me to weddings, slip out of sight, pump, and get right back into the swing of things. This pump has been perfect for the job! The cup is so much more comfortable than the ones that come with my electric pump because it is flexible. I had heard so much about manual pumps taking forever, but this is just as quick as my electric one!"
72175,1,"I got this when my son was about 8 months old, and he just loved to run around in circles as fast as he could! (Careful though, as he got overenthusiastic he actually started to move the entire table as he ran! Beware of sharp corners!)He's 13 months now and still loves the table, I took the chair part off."
78878,1,"Yes, I agree with many that it is a very simple piece of equipment and hats off to the inventor! This worked out great for my little one's first trip to the airport! We were in and out of the security line as quick as can be expected toting all of the stuff and a kid too...the toddler strap was simple and fast. We got lots of comments from people in the airport and it was great!"
179197,0,"I have not yet had or raised children, and decided to review these for Amazon Vine as an interested consumer and design enthusiast. The anti-gas, anti-spit-up,anti-colic, ear infection protection and venting technologies on this VentAire system seem pretty impressive. However, if I had children I would be very wary of using plastic materials in feeding them. Babies are the most susceptible to food-borne impurities. These bottles are advertised as being BPA(Bisphenol-A chemical)-free. However, according to Alex Jones at Infowars and others, the medical and chemical industries knew for decades that BPA was highly dangerous to humans and deliberately kept using it in thousands of everyday products anyway. Jones claims they actually wanted to poison people as a eugenics or population control attempt. If they knowingly used BPA, then they could just as easily be using new dangerous and unknown compounds to induce illness and higher medical expenditures in today's ""BPA-free"" products. The scary thing is, to really evaluate the safety of advanced products like these, you would need to be a professional chemist and medical researcher or comparable scientist with access to all sorts of advanced information, personnel and equipment. We are literally risking our lives every day believing what the medical and industrial establishment is promising us, and they have consistently lied to us in the past. If I was nursing babies w my future wife, I would probably lean towards using glass bottles. There is no reason why manufacturers could not incorporate the same advanced technologies in these designs to protect and nurture babies using glass and sterile natural rubbers instead of plastics. We are really in a quandary as far as not really knowing what is truly safe. But they lied to us about BPA and lie to us about practically everything else. So should we really trust them now?"
91293,0,"While we do like the light feature, we hate the volume control dials. The dials that turn the receiver units on and adjust the volume are very hard to move. It's virtually impossible to turn the unit off or on with one hand (i.e., when you are holding your baby). The first set we had stopped working within 6 months (it just broadcast static all of a sudden) and FP replaced the unit for free with an updated model. While this new ""improved"" unit is similar to its predecessor, the receiver dials were redesigned and are really hard to turn on and off. This was definitely a step down from the previous model that was very easy to adjust. The lights are nice, but we would prefer ease-of-use if we ever have to buy a new monitor in the future."
71123,1,"Our baby is four months old and very tall. He had outgrown his vibrating infant chair but was not able to sit up on his own yet. We needed a place for him to sit and play or snooze while Mommy cooked, cleaned, etc. We love this chair because it has more room than typical infant chairs/rockers. We also like that the chair can convert from a rocker to a stationary seat. The baby has plenty of room to grow with this chair, and when he is old enough, he will be able to use it as a toddler seat. The design is also cute and the baby enjoys the colorful toys. The only negative so far is the vibrating mechanism is a little noisy. We usually have to wiggle it once or twice then it is quiet."
42583,0,This is was hard for me as this was really long for me but my husband likes it better than I do. We do not use this much.
84891,1,"Unfortunately, my big 2 3/4 year old recently needed to give up his Britax Marathon (in my opinion, the absolute BEST booster seat out there for up to 65lbs.) to his little sister. I wanted something that my son would get the most use/time out of. Due to my past experience with Britax, I thought the Parkway would be the one...but the headrest seemed too confining and the height adjustment unsupportive. I also took a good look at the Graco TurboBooster which seemed poorly made & fell apart. I was reluctant to even consider a FOLDABLE seat -- how sturdy could it be? VERY! Extremely well made - strong frame - height adjusts from the lumbar area - deep cup holders - strong, comfortably placed, retractable arm rests (not fabric covered, which I think is a plus) - 'head wings' comfortably supportive but not confining - easy to install & buckle. Unlike other reviews, I find that the fixed seat (which is plenty wide & deep for a big child) is adequately reclined for snoozing & it provides more cushion than ANY other seat I looked at. Although I haven't had to launder it yet, the fabric seems very durable."
129149,1,"My wife bought this cream for one of our babies. I used it by accident one winter night on my face and now this is my 4th tube! If this were in a different package, it could sell for $100 as a night-time face cream."
36264,1,"This product was great, was of very high quality. When i gave it to my mother, she was estatic. It was very nice, i don't really have much more to say about it, but it was very nice, despite the other response that said the plexi-glass was broken, the plexiglass on mine was perfect, and it was shipped very nicely with bags of air around it, and form where the plexiglass was, in a box, inside a bigger box, it would have been very hard for it to break..."
32417,1,"This was the only gate I could find that met all my criteria: it is wide enough for the opening and short enough to fit against a low wall, it doesn't make permanent marks in the wall, and it looked very sturdy. When it arrived, I was very happy with the solid feel and the easy installation. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and all four ""feet"" that fit against the wall are independently adjustable - very important for baseboards. The top ones are round, for maximum contact, but the bottom ones have one flat edge, which fit perfectly along the top of the little molding at the bottom of our baseboards.The gate is really easy for an adult to open, but difficult for a small child. Not only does it require pushing in a stiff button and lifting a little arm, but you also have to lift the entire center gate a half inch. You can do it all with one hand, and it's not obvious to a little one how it works (this kid already tries to push on the foot pedal on another gate).The only downside is that the gate just opens 90 degrees. If it swung farther, the open end would reach the wall. We leave it open most of the time, because it's only for when our littlest grandchild visits, and it would be nicer not to have to dodge the end when coming through."
46856,2,"Got this for my shower in Nov 2004 and it worked great for about 2 months. Then, like many of the people who have written on this one, I found that my mobile no longer worked!!! The motor operating the rotating fish died! Even though my son really seemed to like it, I'm not going to buy another one of these pieces of junk and will instead get the Ocean Wonders mobile. Can't believe they actually sold this for $40! What a rip off! Beware buyers! If you do chance it, save your receipts and packaging!"
168544,1,"Love this product. Good price and simply the best brand. This delivered ontime. Tried Huggies, but I am already spoiled with Pampers brand because of it wetness indicator. It saves lot of time and leaves a guessing out of the way. I like ordering this online because it is a good price as well."
25983,0,"It was given to me and was used by at least two other children before my son. The leatherette was worn out by then so I bought slip cover instead of a new cushion. With the slip cover, it's easy to clean. The tray is high but it keeps my son from grabbing the bowl when I don't want him to. It's easy to roll around. I'm not sure why people are so unhappy with it. If I had to buy a chair, I'd probably go with something cheaper with similar features."
46927,1,"This mattress for my first grandchild's (2 months old)cradle it is wonderful, He says it is nice and comfy with a very nice plastic covering. not cheesy.It is firm but plump compared to the one that came with the cradle that one is nice but i did not like the covering it had over it. and it seemed thinner. very basic.I truly recommend the starlight support cradle mattress it is worth the money. I am so happy my gramma got this for me... I love it."
138164,1,"Even my daughter has 7 years old, she loves it. The options for lights changing is great, and for pajamas party is a success!!!"
70276,1,"My husband and I recently purchased this baby gate even after reading all those horrible reviews. When we went shopping for a gate we didn't have many choices, since we have an area that is 87&quot; wide. We talked with the sales assosiate and informed her of all the reviews we had read about this one particular gate and she laughed. She asked us if we could read, and of course we can, so she said we would have no problems. Our baby is 7 months and we also have a 3 yr. old and the gate works perfect for us. We had absolutely no trouble assembling the gate and we are satisfied with the product. Our only advice is when putting this gate together is to take your time and make sure you read the instructions."
87994,1,"My grandson loves this and has since birth. he is 3 months now and entertains himself reaching for the hanging toys. it's great for ""tummy time"" because of the bright colors! i highly recommend this to every new mother or grandmother."
23491,1,"LOVE this stroller. I bought this to use in Disney World for my 9 month old daughter. It is very sturdy and maneuverable and seemed very comfortable for her. As others said, the sun shade is a tad lacking, but I used a ray-shade in addition and it was perfect. I found it to be very stable, also. We hung a heavy diaper bag, plus miscellaneous bags w/ souveniers, etc. off the back and had very little trouble with it tipping over backwards (occasionally if I hadn't hung things correctly it would get tippy when my dd wasn't in it).Can't say enough good things about this stroller. It's fabulous!ETA: I will say that now that my dd is 21 months old it's getting to be a tight fit. It is pretty narrow and there's no way we'll be able to use it on our next Disney trip in October when she'll be a little over 2 years old. Still a great stroller for the money, but I wish it wasn't so narrow."
99385,1,"These are fine wipes, nice thickness and scent. But it is seriously irritating that you can't ever pull out just 1 with one hand. I guess they overlap too much. It reminds me of the magic trick with endless scarves tied together that just keep coming out of the top hat. We're constantly shoving them back in the dispenser. This won't keep me from buying again, but it is one of those quietly irritating things you deal with every day."
177484,1,"This is a great pump and the bag is small enough to be discreet and large enough that the items aren't cramped. This pump is easy to use and clean and it is also very comfortable. I am a low milk supply mom, making about 8 ounces a day. As a result I have purchased and tried a number of pumps to boost and maintain the supply I have. I have a Medela PIS, Medela Harmony, Ameda manual and an Ameda dual electric pump and this pump is every bit as good as my electrics. I highly recommend this pump. It is especially great to take with you running errands when you are going to be gone long enough that you need to pump before you get home and to use at work."
132829,0,"I use a cloth diaper service, they pick up and drop off once a week. When I got the diaper dekor plus I assumed that it would be big enough to hold a weeks worth of dirty diapers, I only get maybe about two days before they have to start being 'shoved' in... which is just icky, seriously. If you are using disposables and don't mind taking your diapers out to the trash every few days, you'll love this... however, if you going through a service, or just don't want to go out to the trash every few days look into a larger capacity diaper pail."
94223,1,"I borrowed this jumper for my 20 pound, 7 1/2 month old son - he absolutely loves it! And I'm feeling alot less fatigue in my arms and back. Unfortunately, I've found that the strap adjustability is a bit limited. In our 8 foot doorways (with 3.5&quot; molding), our son suspends about 5 inches from the floor (so I have to place a floor cushion under him). In our 7 foot doorways, he stands almost flat-footed (which I worry will strain his ankles &amp; knees while jumping). Overall, in my opinion, this is a very worthwhile product - it has always stayed in place securely and has not marred our doorways."
46320,2,"Had I written the review for this play yard before today, I would have given it 3 stars and said it's a bit disappointing and aggravating, as our 13-month-old is able to shove it around the wood floor dragging his toys behind him. But, as of this afternoon -- when I was on the verge of a panicked visit to the ER after discovering one of the plastic hinges on the floor but NOT initially locating the screw that attaches it -- I give it one star and ask you to BEWARE!!!"
86790,1,"Sturdy, thick hook that attaches well to our strollers. Spring mechanism does not pinch skin. Holds various items nicely within reach."
63241,0,The whole concept of the pacifier closing when dropped is amazing and the panda decoration is so cute but the structural design is off. The 2 pieces that close over the part the baby sucks on stick out too far when the pacifier is open and when the baby is sucking on the pacifier it leaves red marks on their cheeks and also tends to fall out more because of this. Designers should have angled back the plastic to accommodate for the protruding covers.
31005,1,"I took my Joovy Ultralight to Disney World in November 2009. I've been using it for two years now. It is perfect for Disney, especially since I can spot the bright orange easily. I have a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old. I removed the front tray so that my younger daughter can get in and out for the rides on her own (a must for Disney) otherwise she was constantly stepping on the seat to get out. Since she needed storage for her drinks and snacks, etc. I attached two Sunshine Kids Side Rider baskets, one on each side of her seat (attached to the outside arms)... perfect solution for an older child. I wrote to Joovy asking them to make cup attachments accessories like they did for the Ergo.... fingers crossed.I love my Joovy and I plant to use it for my mext Disney trip since it's a lot of walking for young children and renting their double stroller for my stay would have cost $300.00. The only problem is having to take it on the buses back to the resort but it folds up nicely. NOTE: It does NOT stand up when closed! Ugh.It also cleans up nicely. I swear I used only my Huggies unscented baby wipes to wipe the dirty seats after Disney and they came out spotless. I used the wipes because they were all I had. They worked great and no rinsing!I will be devastated when I my girls outgrow it. I'm hoping it has good resale value on eBay!I would like to add that I have never used this stroller with a car seat so please see other reviews if you are interested in that. I used it for my daughters when they were already out of a car seat."
49689,0,"I was searching for a bedrail for a toddler bed, and this is one of the items that came up. Upon reading a few of the reviews, I saw that it could easily be used for just that purpose. Unfortunately, when I received it, it states right on the box that it should not, under any circumstances, be used on a toddler bed because it requires 9"" of space between the siderail and the bedrail for the child to get out and not accidentally get lodged inbetween the two. If that had been included in the description here, I would not have purchased it. You also need to have both a box spring and mattress in order to use this bedrail (we do not), so it can't be used on platform beds either."
44295,1,"We had one of the fisher price bouncer seats (ocean wonders) but our daughter quickly got to big for it when she turned 3 months. so we got this seat. Its great, she acctually sits up and we can even use it to feed her when we dont want her in the highchar"
81801,2,My son was born early so my husband had to run out and get this pump for me while I was in the hospital. It was horrible. It was not comfortable at all. I know it's not supposed to be the most pleasant experience but this was ridiculous. Even the nurses in the hospital told me that it was a horrible pump. Save your money and rent a Mastella (spelling?).
128801,1,"Since using these nipples my daughter has had considerably less colic. They are strudy and long lasting and you can purchase them in different stages so that the nipples never get old because before they are worn out its time to change them. These are also a lot thicker than normal nipples, they are of a higher quality but they only fit avent bottles."
76515,1,"2 things:Our guy likes to fall asleep ""in arms"" (what baby doesn't?) and would awaken within 15-20 minutes when put in that flat crib. The spongies at his sides snuggle him and made his first sleep in the ""inclined to sleep"" a three hour marathon!On my lil guy's 4th day home from the hospital he learned to roll to his side - While I had hoped that the product would keep him on his back, he rolled within it after a few days time. I simply moved the sponges in to fit his sideways body and I'm MUCH more secure leaving him this way knowing that he cannot go further either way. His habit made even the zip-up sleepers scary to me as they would bunch near his face after a roll. Now I tuck his blanket tightly under the inclined pad and am reassured that he will have clear breathing space all night long."
160963,2,"This diaper bag is not the best one out there. The main pouch is not very spacious and once it is filled it pushes out on the three zipper pockets and the singed pocket in the back making them less usable. Also the shoulder strap doesn't quite work right, it always falls off my shoulder. Get the Diaper Dude Messenger bag instead."
145615,1,"My grandson just loves this jumparoo. He is just now 6 months old, is now able to reach the ground on the lowest level and is really beginning to play with all of the toys and jump. Very cute!!"
71317,1,"We bought one of these for our first child in 2003 and she has used it so much (and still does!) that we bought another for our next daughter who was born in August. Have never had a problem yet. To another reviewer- the cow on ours faces forward as long as you hang it from thr middle attachment. Both my girls enjoyed touching, holding, and pulling the toys down to feel. I really like how you can use these for a good couple of years for the same child. Also, you can make them recline more or less using the 2 side buttons, which is very nice, and by using the kickstand, it will rock or sit back into a permanent reclined position."
120977,1,"These diapers are okay for use until your child can roll over or crawl. It seems that no matter which way I stick the straps they still allow leaks up the tummy. These diapers have held up pretty well for the 5 months I used them, but now the velcro is starting to pill and it seems that you could probably pull the the velcro off of the diaper if you take the straps off too fast. Also, I can't figure out if it may just be our water but these diapers have developed these odd orange stains where the seam of the outer layer and inner layer meet. This doesn't effect the function of the diaper but I can't help but wonder what it is. These also cannot last an overnight without a doubler.Overall these have been sturdy and might last through a couple of kids. You have to watch the leaks during ""tummy time"" but a doubler can fix this issue. This is a good cost effective approach to an all-in-one but for us we are trying other diapers now that our son has grown out of these.Overall these"
18822,0,"Once open, it works great. That being said, opening and closing is a joke. I've never encountered a more difficult stroller."
44620,0,"It's a great stroller because the bassinet part is big so baby will fit there for a while, or it's good for bigger baby. Baby can face you or 'the world', I loved that too. The wheels, though, are small but the biggest fault it has is the handle, it can be tilted up and down but when it's on 'down' position and you repeadedly put pressure on it [when crossing streets, high curbs etc.] it WILL break and I have seen that stoller in the garbage just because of that fault."
145059,1,"This has been the best ""playtime"" investment so far. Our 5 month old daughter has enjoyed this so much. The doctor did advise not to have too much pressure on her legs so we make sure she can only touch with her toes. This jumper is great because you can adjust the length of it at 3 different levels. It does not fold up very well but fits fine in the mini-van. We recently took it to our family reunion and it entertained her very well."
29365,1,"Pretty valance - may need something behind it as it is sort of thin, but perfect for little girls' rooms"
106198,1,"I registered for the Diaper Genie thinking it was the way to go, especially since I hadn't really heard about the other brands out there. I'd used the Genie before and found it to be more of a pain, but figured I'd give it a try anyway. I hated it! The specialized bags you have to use, figuring out how the darn thing worked. Then I read about the Diaper Champ and decided I'd give that a try. IT IS AWESOME! Of course you have to change the bag at least once a week (think about things in your refrigerator that are in containers for more than a week -- they start to smell!). You don't need special bags, the flip handle makes it a breeze to use. I've recommended this to all my girlfriends!"
177178,1,"I chose this changing table initially because it matched the Jenny Lind style crib that I already had. After looking at all the other $250 to $500 choices out there, this one was a winner. After using it for 15 months now, it still looks new and has held up really well. I would recommend purchasing a side hook-on organizer for all your diaper changing supplies so you don't have to reach down to the shelves while changing a diaper. Also,I replaced the changing pad with a contoured pad purchased separately."
33925,1,"Great bag for transporting pumped milk to and from work every day. It is sleek and slim but large enough that it can hold multiple bottles or storage bags. Comes with a cooler bag, which can be frozen and used many times. The first bag that I ordered came with the cooler pack leaking, but I sent it back and it was promptly replaced. It's cuter than the cooler bags that come with the typical Medela and Similac and other baby kits -- with a color accent, either baby blue or pink. Pumping every day at work can be grueling, and it's the small things that can add a hint of fun to your day...."
9510,1,"I am so happy I purchased this potty for my son when he was 14 months old. Though I knew he wouldn't be potty trained that early...I wanted him to become familiar with the potty. I bought a white one (so it resembled ours) and put it in our bathroom in front of ""mommy's potty"". Whenever I was in the bathroom sitting on ""mommy's potty"", I sat my son on ""Aidan's potty"". I sat him on it with his clothes on and even let him take it out of the bathroom to play with it. I just wanted him to get comfortable. Well...much to my surprise, I've been able to notice lately (he's now 16 months old) when he's going to go ""poopy""....so I took him and sat him on it naked. I sat on ""mommy's potty"" in front of him and just talked him through what he was doing. Verbal communication and consistant key words really help. He made me so excited when he actually went #1 and #2....This potty...is so comfortable for little guys because it is smooth...nothing will pitch or scratch their important pieces. The best part however was I was able to rinse it with hot water and use a clorox wipe to clean it. Soooo easy to clean. Simple Potty....Simply Perfect.Great for beginners...No bells and whistles....keeps them focused."
46864,1,"I saw this mobile in the store and had to have it. It worked very well for the four months before my son came, but then it stopped spinning. Then, the aquarium starting making a vibrating noise. I was so upset because I spent forty dollars and my son never got to use it. I went to the company's website and emailed them. They emailed me back immediately. They said that yes they had problems with them and to send them my address and they would mail me the replacement parts. They did not ask for proof of purchase, if you lose your receipt.I recieved the replacement parts within a week and my son loves it. I have to give five stars for excellant customer service."
20370,1,"This product and company was great. It was delivered timely, and everything was perfect. I have nothing bad to say about either the product or the company."
48382,1,"I bought this over a year ago, when my daughter was born. Worked great right out of the box. Monitor is portable while reception and picture quality is excellent. Much better than previous models that I bought for my older children"
124648,1,"I absolutely love this ""lovey."" When my daughter was a baby, her grandmother bought her a Little Giraffe one. It was soft, cuddly, and she still loves it at age 3 . I wanted to get one for my son too but with our tight budget couldn't justify the cost. I found this one on Amazon and figured I'd give it a try. I (and my son) love it! The satin side is thick and luxurious. The acrylic side is soft and snuggly. I've washed it many, many times and its actually held up better than the more expensive Little Giraffe version, which lost its softness very quickly. Highly recommend, and it's affordable enough to buy a backup"
74360,0,"this product was made sturdy and arrived quickly, however it was too large for my babygate. it did not fit. the plastic pieces that attach the screws to the wall also did not fit this product. Hopefully returning it will be painless."
47416,2,"This is probably a very safe car seat...it seems to have great protection for a baby so I give my two stars to that aspect of it. However, this car seat does not fit into grocery carts or upside down high chairs in restaurants securely. I have been very frustrated when I get to a grocery store and it wont fit into any of the carts in either the child section where it should snap in, OR even in the main grocery basket section in some stores. I simply can't go shopping with my infant. We bought this car seat thinking that it would be great to have it last a bit longer since it holds infants up to 30 lbs., however, my child is only 3 months and about 14 lbs. and I can barely carry this with her in it. Another concern is that the infant head support for the car seat does not lay properly when used on the second smallest setting...it forces the car seat straps too high to fit properly. Although it's a beautiful car seat, I have to say, I wish I bought a smaller car seat. The stroller that goes with this set is pretty nice, but the car seat once again doesn't fit very well with it. When I put my toddler in the front seat, the infant seat pokes him in the back of the head. I have to lay a towel over it so the hard plastic doesn't hurt his head, but he is still forced to sit with his head uncomfortably forward. I wish I would have made a difference selection in a car seat and travel system."
130282,1,"This is great for getting the little one to sleep and giving mom and dad some free hands time.pros-it's quiet-apparently it's comfortable (sleeping babies don't lie)cons-batteries run down quickly-motor had to be replaced after we used it for 1 week, since then it's fine"
127232,0,"We loved this little stroller until my daughter turned about 9 months. It is too narrow so we now have to purchase another light stroller. One of the seat belt buckles also broke too. Also, the umbrella shade thing is a bit annoying."
139489,1,"Great product. Settings for red, green, or blue stars..turns itself off after 45 minutes - good feature. The little person (under one year old) who received it is completely fascinated."
166281,2,I used swaddlers with my son when he was a newborn so I thought I would try these (he is 1 now). After wearing them for not even two days he developed what I can only describe as a chemical burn. He was really red and when I wiped him I saw tiny drops of blood. He screamed so much and even screamed when I put his diaper back on. After I realized it had to be the new diapers I immediately took his diaper off and put on one of his old diapers and he seemed to be happier almost immediately. The diapers have a very strong scent. When they arrived I put them in our living room and I could smell them from across the room and I hadn't even opened the box yet. I can only imagine this is what my son reacted to. I only used around 10-15 of the 144 diapers so I have emailed Pampers asking what I can do since I feel like I wasted all that money on diapers that can't be used. If your child is used to non-scented diapers I would not try these out. The scent is overwhelming and should have been the only warning I needed. Stupidly I still decided to try them out and now my poor baby is paying the price. If your child is fine wearing a certain brand of diapers then I suggest sticking to that brand. I definitely will now!
161227,2,Enough said.
17754,1,The cream is working and my redness is slowly going away. Will continue touse it as I am tired of looking red all the time. Would recommend to anyone whosuffers with red skin.
24287,1,Bought as asked for in registry - arrived within a few days. Recipient is very pleased......no complaints.Would be nice if enclosed gift card was available.
138885,1,"We bought the Cloud b twilight turtle for our 2 year old son. I love that it fills his whole room with stars. It's so soothing that I want to get one for our room. Our son likes pushing the buttons and making the colors change. Every time he changes it to blue or green, he says the name of the color. So, it's also helping him learn colors."
92680,1,This lock was easy to install and is the best lock we have found so far for sliding doors.
103224,1,Exactly what you would expect since it's made for the jogger. Saved me on a colder morning. He was happy as a clam inside. Wish this came with the jogger.
179273,2,"Since my four month old daughter was born I've used the Dr. Brown's bottles (which are great). However, I decided to also try the VentAire bottles. I was very disappointed from the start because the nippple was VERY slow, even to the point where no formula would come out. The first time I used this bottle my daughter was sucking away and after five minutes I checked the bottle and the formula level hadn't gone down at all. She was very frustrated. I even tried pushing water through the nipple myself while cleaning it, and that didn't help. Not wanting to give up, I then decided to try the VentAire stage two nipple, thinking it was maybe similar to that of the Dr.Brown's stage one. That one made the formula come out much to fast. As a last try I decided to buy some new stage one VentAire nipples... they were just as bad as the first. Many of my friends have tried these bottles also and have had the same complaints about the nipples. Aside of the nipple, I like the bottle set-up (the curve to the bottle) and was hoping it would be good for when my daughter can hold it on her own... After my experience I'm going to stick with the Dr. Brown's."
100117,2,I don't often write reviews but I feel I need to. I have twin girls and have found that everytime I use Pampers they leak. The sizing is correct based on the label but they do not absorb enough through the night. I have had to change sheets many times. I do not find this happens with other diapers and Pampers are expensive.
171194,1,"I wasn't too impressed when I first saw this tub; without all the bells and whistles the others have, I didn't expect it to live up to my standards. (I've seen one with a MOBILE!) The first time I bathed my daughter in it I didn't use the sling; my daughter was always straining to sit and lean forward, so it didn't work well. I think the slanted side needs a non-slip foam piece where the child sits, because my little one always slipped to one side or arching her back and slipping over the support piece. At six months, she still likes to lean to sit forward, but since she can't sit up by herself completely, I keep her in the slanted side. She loves to kick her feet and splash, but I wish the tub came with a small cup or pitcher to pour water with-- or at least a bigger water well. My daughter uses a lot of water to rinse her head off, I guess. I had a small problem storing this tub, but I lived in a tiny apartment. I like the fact that it fits in your sink; but it didn't fit the sink at my apartment because the sink faucet had a lever-type handle, and every time I'd fit the tub into the sink, the tub would push the lever on and water would run all over the place. :) So beware of that. It might also work better with non-skid traction pieces on the bottom of the tub, since I ended up using it mostly inside our bigger tub. The problems I've had are small, but all in all, it's a functional tub. It gets the job done. It's the only baby tub you will need, from sponge bathing to toddler baths."
40143,1,"This is an exellent buy, i have bought before and its worth it would highly recomend."
35610,1,My husband and i purchased this after our 14 month son has gotten sick from shopping cart bars. we had bought another cart cover but it didn't cover the cart and was a pain to use sometimes. the floppy seat is great and our son is more comfortable in carts. we have even used it on restaurant high chairs. it is well worth the money.
114611,1,"This booster seat is great! Our 4 month old can use it, even though he can't sit up on his own. It fits into a small carry-on suitcase and travels easily to restaurants with the carry strap. I love the tray cover and removable divided plate tray. Everything is washable and the trays snap off and go in the dishwasher. This booster seat also has different heights to fit different tables! This was a fantastic purchase that we'll use for many months to come!!"

152439,1,"This blanket is a life saver! It really does help our light sleeper, sleep better. The blanket is on the heavy side so it stays on him at night and doesn't kick off as easily as traditional blankets. He really loves his ""wooly blanket"" and we take it everywhere. Living in the northeast, our winters are very cold. I use this blanket to bundle my baby up when we have to go out to the cold car in the early morning hours to take the older kids to school. The temperature is in the teens, but baby is nice and cozy. I wish I had a blanket big enough for me, especially for those middle of the night feedings."
158929,1,My baby was born 4 weeks early. He had severe gas and at 1 month he started with acid reflux. We went through 4 formula changes and a prescription of Zantac. A stranger recommended these bottles and they changed my son's life. He no longer cries after a feeding due to the acid burning his throat during burping and his gas is all but eliminated - no more knees drawn up to his chest. People complain about the 2 extra parts - but isn't your baby's comfort worth an extra few seconds of part washing? I would recommend these to anyone having a baby. Why wait until trouble starts?
94974,2,"I purchased a total of 11 of these cups over the past 5 months. For the initial use, I did have to push a tooth pick through the slits on the valves. They all worked fine for a while, but have started to leak from the top vent hole (not the spout). I am soooo frustrated! I thought it was the perfect cup and never would have invested that much money in a whole set of them. I can't stand having a million different types of cups. It makes matching them up too difficult. So, I guess I am going to have to switch to another brand. :( i can't handle the leaks."
127784,0,"We have a 49MHz baby monitor, and had problems with interference and hissing, so we bought this model based on the reviews and supposed sound quality. Unfortunately for us this unit was a disappointment, we actually experienced no improvement in sound quality compared to the original baby monitor (Evenflo brand). I was very surprised, since we have 2.4GHz cordless phones and the sound quality is excellent, maybe the phone is interfering with the baby monitor. In any case, we were very disappointed and would not recommend this model."
167974,0,i used it becasue i bought it. not as good as i thoguht it would be for me. BUT my son loved sleeping in it while it was circled. If i was to get pregnant again i wouldnt buy this stlye.
131025,1,"These work really well for us to keep my son's head from falling when he is asleep. He is 7 months and 21 lbs and they are the right size to fit above the chest harness on his seat. He is more comfortable and never drops his head now. I am glad his neck isn't hurting and that he's less cranky when falling asleep in the car.It is very, very important to make sure these will work with your seat. I was able to slide them all the way back at the top and tighten the harness. This ensured the chest buckle was at the same spot as it would be without the pads, and also the same tightness. It's important to do that to be sure your baby is safe. If you take that extra step, this are a really awesome product to keep your kid both safe AND comfortable.I think they are safer than the pillows, which can spin around and cover baby's face. I also would hesitate to use this with a newborn, because I'm not positive that I could get the chest buckle high enough for safety."
180650,1,"For the size and shape, this bag holds more than you would think! I also love that your hands are free when you wear it and that your cell phone is easily accessible. We bought it for our first plane trip with our 3 month old and have used it back home more than our other bags. My only complaint is that there isn't a pocket big enough to hold a fold-up changing pad... but I can fit in the disposable ones."
157305,2,-ProsSpacious-ConsThe color is more of a chocolate and not espressothe finish quality is poortable is not sturdy. my son bumped into it and almost knocked it down. Hes 34 lbs- I could not recommend this for someone that does not have a welder to add stability. After a month I had to keep it against a wall to keep it from falling over.
104206,1,"The product is great quality, and I had to return for smaller size and the companys turn around was wonderful, would use this product again in a heartbeat!"
132579,1,"We love this thing!!! We were going to get the Diaper Genie, then someone referred us to this one. With the Diaper Genie, you twist to rid of the diaper and the more you twist the more liner you use. This is bad because we have heard that with the Diaper Genie, you have to twist more than the recommended amount because of the odor seeping out. With the Diaper Dekor Plus, you don't have to twist or turn and the odor stays in the pail, where it should. You just press the latch with your foot and drop the diaper in, that's it. Your hands are free to keep baby secure while you finish changing them."
46857,2,"My son loved the mobile we bought to match his bedding; however, it was not battery operated, so we had to keep winding it. We decided to buy him a battery operated mobile with sounds and lights...this is the THIRD calypso mobile we've bought/exchanged. All of them quit working after about 2 or 3 days. The lights dim, the mobile stops rotating, the remote doesn't work, and the aquarium makes a loud rattle. This was the WORST BABY item we've bought."
98716,0,"After reading all the positive reviews on this product and already owning a Britax Roundabout, I was excited to get this car seat and install it in my vehicle - a '99 Plymouth GrandVoyager. Well, after just over 1 week of use I'm not overly impressed, and am some what disappointed in it.It is HUGE - I didn't realize just how huge until I put it in my vehicle. I did get it installed, barely. It used 100% of the seatbelt for the under 40 lbs installation. Which is probably a good thing, considering it doesn't have the built in belt locking clip like the roundabout. But what really miffs me is that it is difficult to adjust the harness straps because of the design of the seat. What I loved about the Roundabout was it was so easy to adjust the harness for different clothing and the like. But with the Regent the straps are squished between the carseat and the vehicle seat - the pressure makes it difficult to adjust the harness. Perhaps this would not be as much of an issue with bucket seats? But if it's hard to get the straps tightened appropriately, the child is less likely to be strapped in correctly and safely.Within a few days of use I had the harness straps get twisted around some how, I have no idea how. As for the little elastic things that are suppose to hold the straps back to make it easier to get kids in and out - worthless. Maybe they will be more useful when my daughter is much larger.Hopefully though it is as good for safety as they say. Though I hope to never need to find out. Because that's about the only positive thing I've got to say about it - other than it seems a comfortable seat to be in. Which is important when you take a lot of 3-5+ hour drives."
44467,1,"I have two of these sheets and overall I think they're great. Because the portable crib mattress is thin and doesn't seem very comfortable on its own, these sheets add a bit of extra softness and cushion without adding so much that the mattress becomes too soft and therefore unsafe. My only concern is that since they fit the mattress so snugly (which is a good thing overall) they seem to make the mattress bunch up a bit in the middle, at the seam where you fold it when not in use. I have to pull the mattress at both ends to make it stop bunching. However, this could be the mattress itself and not the sheet."
113115,1,"We've had this stroller for 4 months now and have been using it regularly indoors (malls, restaurants, etc.), outdoors, rain and snow. It performs really well in most any environment. It folds in a snap with no bending down to pick it up (you'll realize the importance of that once you try out other strollers). And it opens in one motion.We live on the 2nd floor and need to carry it up and down occasionally--it's lightweight design is a plus here. The stroller can also be pulled behind you (like luggage) up stairs (when closed). It's easy to fold and store in the car. We bought the Compass compatible car seat which offers the convenience of snapping it in. (To use, the arm pads must be popped off the stroller first, which takes 10 seconds.)The suspension offers a comfortable ride, but it also saves your wrist joints as well. The drive is silky smooth and we've never had difficulty in the bends. While showroom testing, we found this stroller to be STURDIER than the Peg Perego Pliko P3. It has no shakiness or wobbles. Comes with a rain cover and cup holder.I think that for the price, no other stroller comes close."
30624,0,"This tub was wonderful for the first 4 months or so. My baby could recline on the one side and the tub fit nicely over the kitchen sink--so no bending over. As my child got older (but was still unable to sit on his own), the tub wasn't so wonderful. He was too big for the reclining area, but slipped around on the other ""seating"" side because there isn't a non-slip surface on that side. I thought about putting some of those non-slip tub stickers on the bottom, but ended up getting him a different seat for the big bath tub because the bump in the middle of this tub was getting in the way. The toys, however, were nice and we still use them."
157138,1,"I wouldn't be able to live without this dual pump breastpump! My only regret is that I didn't purchase it before my daughter was born, so that I could have relieved my engorgement! I have used this pump from the beginning, and now that I am back to work, I am so glad that I spent the extra money on this pump. I have a friend who purchased the single pump, and she quit breastfeeding after four months because it took too long and she didn't want to spend the extra money on the dual pump. I have been strictly breastfeeding for almost five months, and I know that I can go for the entire first year, which is well beyond what I expected I'd be able to do when I was still pregnant. Definitely purchase the hands free bustier from La Leche Connection on ebay, so that you can type or do other things while pumping. I can even get ready, blow dry my hair, and do my makeup while pumping! It's a must!"
4152,1,From my wife:This is the fourth diaper bag I've bought and it is the best by far. There are plenty of pockets where you need them and they are easily accessible with one hand. I love that I can have two hands free and it stays upright when I put it down. The bag is cute and the fabric is durable. It's a fantastic bag!
173203,0,"I bought this product to protect our leather seats. It does the job well but I can't get the seat belt to tighten down as well as without it. The car seat will move about 2 inches left or right. I wonder if this is safe enough. Also, the seat protector makes it difficult to reach the other seat belt latches because it is fairly wide.All in all, I think it's a good product but there may be better ones out there."
91741,0,"This product is easy to use and durable, but my son is scared to have it placed on his stroller. Maybe he's claustrophobic. I do plan to try it out on the next baby."
145221,1,"we love this!! It doesnt take up as much room as I thought it would, which is really nice AND it's so cute! My son is only 3 months old so, so far all he does is play with the toys but I'm positive he's going to love jumping in it!"
154603,2,"Instead of unscented, they should say fragrance-free, they are NOT unscented. They smell terrible. I was all for something more natural, and was hoping to stick without fragrance...but these are def. not the ones I'm going to stick with. I have to use through this whole box I ordered (which sucks) and I have already cancelled this subscription. As far as wetness, I found them to be wet enough and big enough comparable to other natural-type wipes I've used before (California Organics). I just can not handle the smell...really...it is bad."
155012,1,"Originally, I was concerned because others had problems with their mattresses fitting. But this one fits perfectly inside my pack n play portable crib. I'm very satisfied. Note: might want to buy a waterproof cover to go over it (I have no idea where to find one). If the baby pees while in the crib and the diaper leaks, the sheets don't provide much protection and the mattress can start to smell. Yuck. It doesn't help to wash it with soap and water either."
66992,0,"I liked the look of this product, so I got it. Used it once, and the lid melted (warped) in the dishwasher. I've never had that happen in the top rack of my dishwasher.So, if you're willing to handwash, the contents work just fine. Otherwise, skip this product."
67858,1,"We have loved our DuoGlider for years, it works great, but today for the first time I took it apart to wash the fabric parts. It was a nightmare! After unscrewing many screws I was able to get everything off except for the top back canopy. It is screwed in with something that cannot be removed...there is no way to take off the piece that it is attached too! So, everything else will be clean and look new and the top most noticable part will still be dirty! AHH! That was really frustrating to find and thought other moms might want to know it! It is my only complaint about the stroller though!"
38539,2,"The picture is very deceiving! It looks like it holds a baby that is at least a couple of months old, with his head safely elevated, in a fair amount of water. I've also read reviews that indicate people use this with 5 and 6 month old babies. My 15 pound 10 week old barely fits on it! It was so small, not what I expected at all. It is more of a pillow than a tub. It is also very flat and does not keep the baby very elevated in the tub. It does seem like it may be nice for sponge bathing a new born though."
103002,1,"I had this chair, but I left it at my mother's house (she lives out of town).So, I thought that I'd try the &quot;other&quot; one made by The First Years. I returned it, and I bought another Safety First booster seat.The First Years booster seat was difficult to put together. It was difficult to tell if the seat had &quot;snapped&quot; into place. With this chair, on the other hand, it is very obvious whether or not it is put together correctly. Since I leave this with grandparents, I want the chair to be easy and safe, and I don't want to be required to give a lot of direction. This chair is the way to go.I had the first chair for over 6 months, but I used it only occasionally. I keep the chair in my trunk to use at the houses of friends and relatives and at restaurants that don't have high chairs. It is very handy. Now that my daughter is 1 1/2 years, I use only the chair without the tray."
150321,0,"The changing pad cover is very soft and fits appropriately. The only problem is that it is NOT sage in color; it is more of a lime green. I had read this in another review and chose to purchase it anyway, but was disappointed when the product arrived and sure enough, it is lime green. If you are looking for a bright green changing pad this is a great one, if you want a sage changing cover keep looking."
56127,2,"When we first put this gate up, I thought it was great and for the first month saw no problems at all. But, after only a month, my 11 month old son has learned where to push to unlock it. He has never actually opened it up on his own, but he has unlocked it (I always get to him before he pushes it open. We will be removing this gate and finding one that he would not be able to open on his own, since that's pretty much the point!"
119379,1,"I was so glad I had this for my newborn! I use the boppy mainly now for my older baby (or just a pillow), but I used this Brest Friend exclusively for the first two months. It creates such a nice stable platform for holding the baby and I love the little head support bumps. Getting the hang of breastfeeding was so tiring and frustrating at first, and this support pillow really made my life easier."
155464,0,"The ABC jersey cradle sheet was ordered for a visit from our brand new grandbaby. I bought two of these sheets, one pink and one green. They fit (barely) pulling up the corners of the cradle mattress until they were stretched out by hand and smoothed out. They are thinner than I would have liked, but they seemed to do the trick. They fit much better than the Gerber cradle sheets I also bought, which were so small they would not allow the cradle mattress to lie flat. I had thought all cradle mattresses would be standard-sized, hence why I wondered why all of these sheets were constructed so skimpily.I am glad I bought them, however, and we've used them extensively for the baby this holiday visit.If you buy a cradle, these are the only sheets I could find that seem to fit, and you'll want to also purchase a mattress pad for underneath."
173253,1,great fit in my 2006 Malibu and it helps prevent the car seat from digging in. like that its also meant for when the kid gets older. great investment.
54102,0,Great product. It would be better if the adhesive actually stayed stuck to the stove. Had to purchase glue for hot surfaces.
142788,2,Not nearly the quality I was looking for.. too flimsy and not very pretty in real time. Would not recommend
16385,1,"This is a great blanket, exactly what I was looking for.Easy to clean up, water resistant, folds up into a massanger bag - so easy to carry.I bought gray/green one and the colors are very nice."
58836,1,"i was a super-sterilizing crazed first-time mom! i received this product through my baby registry-but did not use it at first. i did not trust our dishwasher to do the trick (i had visions of our germs, crusty food & dishwasher water-no matter how hot-flying around with my newborn's bottles. boiling bottles shortly began to wear on my nerves (making me feel bad for those coming decades before us, having to do it ""the old fashioned way"")this sterilizer was super easy to use, and worked very well-i recommend it to anyone that has sterilizing on their chore list! a must have for new moms!!!! trust me!(great for bottles, binkys, breast pumps, and first time use of sippy cups!)"
146979,0,"So this was easy to assemble and softens a hardwood floor. However, once you have a baby who can crawl, they will be off this tiny mat in no time and you lose the protection. Also, our son has really taken to ripping the pieces apart. Granted this is fun and does no damage to the mat. But now the mat is just another toy that has to be cleaned up every night.Speaking of clean, the bottom of this gets SO gross. It is a magnet for hair and fuzz. I wish you could rinse them off and put in the dishwasher. But couldn't find anywhere that this would be ok."
25554,0,"Unlike a lot of liners, this material is very stiff, almost paper-like, instead of cloth-like. BUT it definitely works - it keeps its shape and keeps messes off the diaper. Only 3 stars, though, because the material is so coarse, it cannot be that comfortable."
183769,1,"This is the best changing pad because the sides are extra high, helping keep an active child on the pad. I always have my hand on my daughter or my body pressed up against the changing table in case she get overly active, but the the high sides on this pad give me a bit of assistance in keeping my active baby on the changing table. Safety is first and this pad gets my vote. It is great!"
182472,1,"I bought these for my son's room and was nervous about how well they would stick to our textured walls. But they worked great. I even moved them around a few times trying to find the perfect spot, and they still stick well."
30961,1,"We love the whaley whale bedding. The quilting done on it is so interesting. You can't really tell this in the picture, but the soft fabric is sewn so it looks like there are waves running through the water background. My daughter really likes the feel of the bumper.The one problem we found was that the ties on the bottom and top of the bumper do not hold it onto our crib very well. I had to snip the bottom ties and hand sew them onto the top between the existing tie lines in order to make it fit our crib better. Even with this tiny alteration, I would buy this product again in a heartbeat. It's extremely cute, and I think it works well for babies of any gender."
34553,0,"This diaper pail is well-priced and you don't have to buy the expensive refills since it takes normal trash bags. Unfortunately, it sometimes smells bad and it makes my son's entire room smell. Also, since this diaper pail has kind of a round shape, my son has discovered if he knocks it over, he can sit on it and roll from side to side (yuck).My sister got the Diaper Champ, which also takes regular trash bags and it seems to work better. She upgraded when she was caring for multiple children in diapers."
8607,1,"My parents bought an antique cradle for me when I was born. They passed it on to me when my baby was born. Luckily, it still had my 40 year old mattress in it or I would have been at a loss. The cradle is long and narrow (15 x 36) The only mattress I could find to fit it was 15 x 30. These sheets worked great and held up well. No problems fitting the 15 x 30 x 2 mattress. Washed well and were very soft. No shrinkage in the dryer."
30204,2,"I received the mobile and it looked used. The white plastic was all scratched up and dirty. I tried to clean it up, but nothing worked. We were disappointed and decided not to put it in the baby's room."
122757,1,"I bought this for my 2009 Kelty double (deuce swivel) jogging stroller (for cold weather). This weather cover is wonderful in that there is minimal vinyl (baby can still see out through the window). The fabric part is nice material. It goes on the stroller so easily, that if we were out and got caught in the rain, I could put it on quickly. It comes with a handy storage bag, too. I can put it in the stroller pocket. Like any weather cover, once your kids' feet get to be long (my 20-month-old already has her feet to where they can reach the cover by the footrest), their feet might bump into the cover. My 3-year-old knows enough not to kick at it. No problem for little babies, though.The fit is very good, which amazed me. I feel I can take my kids out in below 32 degree weather now. I'm not saying that 0 degrees (as it can get in Chicago) would be ideal!The Protect-A-Bub company did not respond to my emails, so I had no idea if this would fit or not. There was no picture of a side by side double jogger on the website. Turns out I am very happy with this purchase. The Kelty company offered their own weather cover for my stroller, for $80 (and it's the same design as their bug cover, which was too hard to actually attach). I am glad I only paid under $30 for the Protect-a-Bub. Love it!"
137704,1,"This ladybug is among the best toys our boy has hoarded in his first year. It's also the only one he treats with any respect, gently patting it on the back instead of banging on it like he does with just about everything else. The ladybug transforms any ordinary room into a dreamy nightscape. Absolutely wonderful."
154715,1,"These are the best wipes I've found. We've tried all the major name brands, plus store brands in many different varieties and fragrances. These are our favorite. They're softer than the others, more durable, they are unscented and have many less chemicals so much gentler and healthier for the skin. I also like this size of package. Small enough to not take up too much space in the diaper bag, purse, car console etc. They reseal so no need to put them in a separate container after opening. Again, I generally order these from Amazon and the packaging is minimal and easy to get into so that is another plus."
169297,1,"I LOVE these diapers. I have never had leaks with these and my baby has not experienced any diaper rashes while using these. I can diaper before bed and go all night until late in the morning (after 9:00 AM) and still no leaks. The diaper is quite full by then, but not leaking. The ""netting"" layer on the surface is great for catching anything less than runny. I would highly recommend this product!"
46157,1,"We received this mobile as a gift when our daughter was only a few weeks old. She was fascinated by it from the beginning and continues to be interested in it even at 6 months. (Once she started getting grabby, we had to remove the extra plastic links so that the images were out of reach.) Our baby clearly preferred this mobile to the musical one that we bought her (at twice the price, I see now). The changeable images keep it interesting and stimulating, from very simple black/white/ red geometics for the youngest babies, to more colorful images and faces as baby gets older. This mobile is designed for infants up to 5 months, but our 6 and 1/2 month old is still interested in it--I haven't had the heart to move it from its position on the changing table. One of the best gifts ever!"
77465,0,"There are a lot of features on this swing that are beneficial to have with a difficult baby. However, don't expect too much in terms of quality. I don't think this would last through multiple children or work for larger, older babies.We bought the Starlight Papasan cradle swing in a moment of desperation when our son was a week old. It was a life-saver, or rather a sleep-saver. (Thank you Amazon for one day delivery!) Being sleep-deprived and liking the word ""starlight,"" I hadn't realized the colors were purple. When we opened it, my husband said was ""there are no gender stereotypes in this house"" and built it immediately. Honestly, the color is well-chosen to fit for either a girl or a boy. Our newborn slept in it for several hours a day/night. Eventually we switched the seat position as his preferences changed; the multiposition seat is a big plus for this product.After a few weeks, we were not using the swing often for naps because we preferred our son to sleep in the crib. However, when he became overtired or had trouble napping, the motion could keep him asleep for 2-3hrs. Now he's almost 4months and possibly teething. He's also started having issues with short naps; as soon as he gets to REM sleep he wakes himself up and cannot fall asleep again. The Starlight Papasan is in full swing again.I don't like how far the seat reclines, or rather how far up it doesn't adjust to. Though adjustable, the baby is always reclining more than about 45degrees.He's a large baby at just under 17lbs now. Based on the flexing and motion of the swing, I cannot imagine putting a 25lb child in it as claimed in the product description. There is play in the bolt that holds the seat in place. It's still secure and safe; but I don't like seeing the seat wiggle or tilt. Fisher Price could have had a better design or higher precision machining. Second, the wiggling of the frame during operation is easily noticeable; the top translates 5-10mm during swinging. I can also see the plastic top wobble substantially when my son kicks. I don't have any other swing for comparison though. Finally, the lights have a tendency to turn off during operation and sometimes the rotating toys don't start either. Most likely, there is an issue with the switch turning it on. I've had quality issues with our Fisher Price bouncer too, which we took apart and repaired ourselves. I assume that we'd be able to fix the problems with the lights and rotating toys on the swing if we tried."
62831,2,"As a first time mom I thought this would be a great item to have, oh my was a WRONG!! Fisrt it was dificult to figure out how to use it then once I did it just never seems to work the way it should! My son is now three months old and I have used it maybe 10 times and every time just end up very frustrated! I would recomend doing some research and finding a better product! If I had'nt thrown away the box this item would have been returned a long time ago!"
14370,0,"I have four kids under the age of Five, so we have been experts in the bottle arena.The problem the tall thin bottles provided, was the cleaning aspect. Tight ridges hard to clean, and you needed the special brush to do it.The advent bottles seemed to fix that problem.. I could fit a lot of my hand in them and they were easier to pour stuff into, but they did leak. This, and they dont fit on my favorite pumps- The Medela Brands.It's 50/50 to me."
145028,1,"my husband and i love this bag. the size of the bag is just what we needed. we have been using this bag for over a year and half when my son was just a newborn and now a toddler ... it is very versatile. i fit what i needed in the bag: a blanket, a pant, a shirt, 3 diapers, two packs of wipes, 2 napkins, a cup, a snack box, eating utensils, a bottle of water, 2 little toys, a stick of sunblock, and my stuff - a purse, a cellphone, car keys and a digital camera.this bag also fit on stroller if you do not want to carry it. i find the compartments sufficient. in the interior it also has dividers, on the top opening there are two zipper compartments, on the side they include a diaper mat compartment and i fit my 3 diapers and wipes, and the two front pockets are for easy access. just all in one a great bag to have for any parents."
55215,1,"We conquered the potty with this stool! Well the stool didn't do all the work for the potty training, but it did make it easy for my daughter to get herself up and down safely to the adult potty in our house. My daughter is short and has one leg that is very short so using the standard Baby Bjorn stool (which we have 2 of) just isn't broad or tall enough to enable her to be self sufficient. This sturdy wider, taller base and easy to remove side arms give her the stability to go alone."
41155,1,This is the only one really keep my son dry whitout liking...
117317,1,"I bought two, one for each kitchen door, and it took me an evening to install them both, but I now have peace of mind when I leave my house because the dog is contained. Easy packaging, clear instructions, no tools required - and strong once they're up. The wood finish goes well with my house and makes the whole set-up more homey."
159242,1,"Great because:My daughter loves it! It's really colorful and looks like a lot of fun!Why only 4 stars? Only gripe:-Not portable. You can stuff it in your car or SUV, but the bouncer doesn't fold up easily. Otherwise, excellent pick!"
62279,1,"Ok, here is my blunt and objective man-oriented perspective regarding this baby's cologne...it smells ok. As soon as I opened it, the Johnson's Baby Shampoo came to mind, so I would say that the smell is somewhat similar, but not identical to that. My wife likes it, the Baby doesn't care, so I guess that for the price it should be a good buy to have your baby smell Johnson's clean...that would be my best description of the smell: Johnson's clean. If you are familiar with Johnson's products, then you know what I mean. If you have never smelled the Johnson's Baby shampoo, then I will say that this cologne smells like flowers mixed with a bit of soap. That is my man-oriented review for all the Fathers out there that also do Baby shopping! Hope it helps!"
182546,1,"I recently purchased this and love it. I prefer to carry my baby around with me and this makes it so much easier. There are other great slings out there too, but my main problem with many of the other slings is their look. I really like how cute and modern HotSlings are. I'll be saving up to buy another one soon! Definitely recommend it. Oh, and I used their website to find out my size and I think they do a great job of helping you get the right size."
105308,1,"This is the easiest diaper pail ever. I never considered the Diaper Genie since I didn't want the extra expense of buying refills. This diaper pail is easy to change and use, I used a Diaper Genie recently at a friends and had to have her throw the diaper out because I couldn't figure out how to use the diaper genie. My daughter is now 11 months old and we still have no odor from this pail. I bought one large box of bags (500) before she was born and still haven't needed to buy more. I would recommend this product to all new parents."
14730,2,"I would give this system 0 stars if it would let me! I have the whole system, bottles, pump, warmer, pacifiers, you name it. My son hates the pacifiers, newborn size is not large enough to stay in his mouth and next size gags him. They are a bad design overall. The Nuk pacifiers are much better. They are softer and they conform to his face better. The nipples leak like crazy and the milk comes out of the newborn nipples WAY too fast. My son gags on that long hard nipple and then he gulps for air as the milk is being sprayed down his throat. It came out so fast that he would be drenched in milk within seconds of giving him the bottle. They also give him horrible air bubbles. He ends up spitting up a substantial portion of everything he takes in. We stopped using them and got the Playtex nurser with drop ins and he is much happier. The nipple on the playtex nurser is (contrary to Avent advertising) MUCH more like my nipple than the Avent nipple. It is soft and pliable and it sticks out only when he sucks on it-unlike the avent nipple that juts out permanently. Also, the bags on the disposable nurser leak. Their seams are very weak and would leak through both layers even when we double-bagged them. Avent has great advertising-that is about the only thing great about it."
18826,1,"I just received this stroller in the mail and am very happy with it. I am expecting my second son any day, and have an 18 month old son. I've already taken him for a couple walks in it, so he gets used to it and he really likes it. It's so easy to steer and turn, much easier than any other strollers that I tried out in Babies R Us. It is a little hard to fold up, but I've read other reviews that say after a few times of folding it, it gets ""worn in"" I highly recommend this stroller."
181046,1,My son loves this. He enjoys watching the colorful lights flash on the top. The soothing jungle sounds are nice too. It is large but does fold flat for storage. The hanging toys are colorful and eye catching. I was disappointed that the two butterflies that hang from the center do not turn by themselves. I originally thought they would be like a mobile and would turn automatically. Instead they just sort of hang there.The batteries in the unit are installed within the giraffe's bottom using two screws (as with most children's toys). I wish it used AA's or even D size batteries as C's are not something we usually keep on hand in our house. The battery life is pretty long though.
90425,0,"Overall, I like these diapers. They are soft and absorbency is pretty good. I'll keep using these since Amazon has a great offer. Pampers seems overpriced though. I liked that these were a lot softer than the Huggies Snug & Dry. The Huggies feel stiff and too much like paper.Absorbency wise, I tried both of these overnight and the Huggies had better absorbency."
81567,2,My husband and I purchased this monitor yesterday and today it is going back to the store. There was a clicking noise every 15 seconds while the monitor was on and when we went to use our telephone the parent base would make an awfully loud static noise. I would not recommend this product at all.
176215,1,"I love the Avent feeding bottles, they are great, a baby doesn't have near the gas and belly aches as they do with the other leading brand's of bottles. They are definetly worth the extra $!"
183588,0,"I like the seat well enough - It locked in great with the LATCH system into my 2001 Dodge Caravan, and the five point harness loosens and tightens nicely - BUT - regarding the strap lock that sits on the chest...my old carseat had one that fit together, metal buckles under plastic covering, and you had to pinch a button at the top and bottom of the buckle simultaneously to open it. This buckle is made of just plastic, and there is a little square in the front that says PUSH on it, and when you do, the buckle opens. The problem is, my 3-year old has no problem opening it himself. If he continues to do this while I am driving, I will be forced to purchase another (different!) carseat."
1750,0,"I got a great deal on this box of diapers using the code from Parents Magazine and joining Amazon's Mom's Club, but sadly, my baby leaked through these every night. We had to wear a Pamper's Cruiser each night. But for daytime diapers, it was a good deal!"
116468,0,I bought this bag about 7 months ago and use it everyday. The plastic laminate is cracked on the corners and the strap is beginning to come loose from the bag. It wasn't worth the money I spent on it.
152312,2,We received this item as a gift at a baby shower. The first month it worked great. We loved the vibration feature. Now the wireless connection between the control module that sits on the side of the crib and the vibration module does not work unless they are within 2 to 3 inches of each other. (yes I have replaced the batteries X2). So this makes it completely impracticle to use now. I would have rated 4 to 5 stars but with this breakdown withing the 1st month I have to go with one star.
57905,2,"I did not have much luck with this warmer. I purchased this warmer because I liked the idea of storing the bottles in my bedrrom opposed to having to go downstairs in the middle of the night to retrieve a bottle from the fridge, but the warmer is ineffective.The warmer is built to carry an ice pack and two bottles in its cooler. The idea is when the baby wakes in the middle of the night you can just go to the warmer, pull out a bottle from its cooler, add water to the warmer, and warm the bottle. The thing is, the bottle does not warm effectively. I was using the bottles with the bags. The bottles took so long to heat. Then the warmer would cut off and my bottle would still be cold. So I would have to run to the bathroom and place the bottle under the hot water faucet to continue heating."
42291,0,"What I like about the Moby: It is soft & cozy and conforms to the baby's shape. It is light weight and easy to wash. There are many different ways to wear your baby (although not all of them are suggested by the manufacturer). Mobys are great for sleeping babies who still like to be swaddled. One of my best friend's baby (3 months at the time) slept through an entire 2 hour dinner at a restaurant in the Moby. Both Mom & baby were comfortable & because the Moby is not bulky like some other carriers Mom could move around without disturbing the baby. I also like how the Moby wrap can pull over the side of the baby's head (when baby's cheek is against your chest) to keep baby snug and prevent a wobbly head. The moby is easy to pack to take on a trip and can also fold to go inside of my diaper bag.What's not my favorite about the Moby: The Moby is a very long piece of fabric and it is easy to get tangled. It definitely takes practice (if it even is possible) to seamlessly put your baby in or take your baby out. I still remember a friend telling me about their ""fight"" with their Moby in the Target parking lot. If you are already trying to do several things and are in a hurry, the Moby can be really frustrating. Also, no matter how good of a knot tier you are, it does get loose and baby ""sags,"" which requires adjustments. Also, and this is knit picky, there is a lot of fabric left in the knot when you tie behind your back and if you try to sit while still wrapped up the knot makes sitting uncomfortable. (I will say though I have enough fabric to pull around front a second time and tie which solves this problem, but this is not possible when babies or mom's build are bigger). As far as lasting comfort -- carrying my daughter while shopping for a couple hours results in a back ache. Lastly, the man (at least mine) does not fine the Moby to be something he would like to carry Baby in -- even in a gender neutral green like we have, he does not prefer it.you can read more of my review of the moby wrap plus get a review/comparison of the Ergo carrier and the bjorn carrier by visiting my blog: [...]"
22019,1,I ahve yet to use these but they are pretty self explanitory. I am sure they will work well for storing and freezing and I look forward to the babies arrival so I can use them. :)
1584,1,I have been using diapers for my lil one for ten months now and I love pampers the most. One huge factor was the over night diaper was not leacking and another the gel that forms once the diaper is wet does not come out. When I used huggies the diaper felt very very wet and the gel was all over her bottom once she would wake up.
183910,2,"I must agree, LUVS let the poo goo out! They absorb pee just fine, but the messy poo seepage stinks!!! If I wanted to clean poop out of the carpet, carseats etc I would have opted for the reuseable diapers.... but I want to throw the mess in the trash where it goes.... not along with my little ones clothes! I have 3 kids and have found that any brand works better... I prefer Cottontails Giant brand or Playskool which I can only find at CVS...Then again... LUVS work just fine for those who expect that poo was meant to goo...."
79740,1,"I received this monitor as a gift for my first baby back in November '08. I'm now on baby #2 & still using it for both kids! There are a few minor flaws with it but it's still a great product. It gets a little staticky sometimes but if you move around it goes away. I also found that if you point the flat ""antenna"" on the back of the camera towards where you keep the monitor most of the time it's not that big of a deal. I have to keep it plugged in most of the time bc the batteries it came with are finally losing their charge. I plan on buying replacements soon. Sometimes if you have the screen turned off so you can just listen to the sound & try to turn it back on it won't work. I usually turn it on & off a couple of times then the screen comes back. I have found that the color is more like a greyscale color, very rarely does the color actually work but the picture is still great. I love the nightvision, but it doesn't work too good if you have the camera mounted far away. I have my 2 yr old's camera mounted in the corner of his room & when it's dark you can't really see since his bed is on the other side of the room. The feature where you can scan both cameras isn't very good, has alot of static between cameras. Aside from those few flaws...this is the best baby monitor, I've never tried anything else!"
112187,1,I am so happy with Pamper's Cruisers. They never leak. I never have any problems with them. They seem comfortable to my baby. I'd recommend them. You do get what you pay for!
162603,0,"I think the huge variation in reviews on this tub has to do with how different babies will sit in it. I too bought this one because it folded up under the sink and I didn't want to have to store it in the middle of our bathroom. It did the trick when our little guy was a newborn, BUT:- The water now barely covers him at 5 months (16 pounds! he's big). If you try to fill it higher, the water spills out through the hinges as everyone else has said- He bangs his head and feet on the hard plastic edges. He's active now and likes to splash the water. Problem is, the tub really isn't that big, and he wacks his head and feet on the tub and gets big red marks on his skin. He actually cried the other night when he hit his head.- The non-skid back really doesn't do the trick. He always ends up sliding sideways, and has done that since he was a newborn.Really though, overall we've been happy until now. I think it's just time to move on and for the price, it's been worth it for 5 months."
123233,1,"I loved this play pen, it is square and nice and roomy for my son to play in, he moves around easily and has great color schemes that are so eye catching. My son also likes to take his naps in this playpen, he is very comfortable in it and can stand easily. the extra toys built into the sides amuse him all the time and it is very easy to fold and un-fold for very easy transportation when we go on vacation and to take inside and outside. Love this playpen and my mother-in-law liked it so much she bought one for her home as well."
36552,1,"I bought this for a trip to Disneyland for my 19 mo. daughter. I did noticed other children wearing similar types of harness but never did I see a Koala.The strap:The strap is not retractable. It is ~4 ft long (just the right distance in my opinion) and if you want it shorter you can just wrap the strap around your hand several times. The strap is about 1 inch wide and made of the same material as the koala (soft and plushy so it's not abrasive in your hand). The strap ends in an loop (strap is basically folded and sewn together) for the parent's hand which at first I didn't think anything of but it's actually an added help since you can secure it around your wrist (or the stroller) when you are tire of holding it. The part that attaches to the bear is detachable. Your child can just carry the koala by itself and/or you can just use the strap secured to a loop on your child's pants etc.The koala:It has the cutest ears. My daughter loves the ears since it has tuffs of furr sticking out of it, and when she is carrying the backpack, you can see the koala's head sticking pass her shoulder and these two big fluffy ears. I noticed in the product feature it says ""Backpack area is small zippered pouch that will hold a small toy"". The opening of the pouch on ours is vertical, on the back of the bear, and is secured by a 1x1in. velcro. Its about the size of a large pocket (i.e. you can only fit a hand in). I use it to tuck away the strap when we put the bear away.Reading some of the reviews here I was afraid my daughter will not like the harness so I first introduce this harness as a toy to her and let her play with it for awhile. She thinks its another one of her plush toys and when I finally secured it around her back she thinks its part of the game. Very happy with the product. It did what it was suppose to do with cosmetic appeal."
127207,1,"This wall border is easy to use, good quality, and colorful. The border is stick to the wall firmly unlike others it would came off and have to use addtional adhesive."
47164,1,I love this stroller. Only downside is a toddler can't comfortably sit while the cars eat is used.Other than that it's excellent!
403,1,Asusal... Pampers is the best... we are using it form my baby from past 14 months... no complaints... actually we never tried any other brand... from day 1 we are using the same one....we amazon mom it is much more cheaper than store prices...
114036,1,"I bought this seat because I did not want a high chair that takes up lots of space and because we wanted to have our daughter sit at table level. It is a great chair! Easy to assemble, easy to tighten the straps so that the chair is secure, and easy to clean. I did not think we would take it out with us, but we take it to friends' houses and to restaurants. It keeps our daughter happier than a restaurant highchair (because it is comfortable & because it has a tray) and we don't have to worry about germs and grime that thrive on restaurant provided chairs. This has been a great purchase. Sometimes our daughter eats in it and other times she just plays contentedly while the rest of us eat dinner. Highly recommend this chair!!"
17013,0,"I received the ""sage"" 4-pocket organizer and canvas folding bin as a gift and I was disappointed with the color -- it's a bit more minty-green, much brighter than the photo. I know it's hard to represent accurate color on the web (I do it for a living), but they really should not have named it ""sage"" in the first place. I also wish there were more color choices than these. Off-white, pale yellow or lavender would have been great choices.On a positive note, the quality seems good and the embroidery is cute."
114639,1,"Easy to secure, use and clean. As a busy parent who travels a fair amount; that's a trifecta that can't be ignored."
106029,2,"At first we were pleased with the Diaper Champ because of its easy-to-use function and the fact that we did not have to buy special refills or bags. However, we quickly learned that the biggest drawback to the Champ is its inability to seal in odor. We frequently empty the bags and clean the pail (including Lysol, chlorine bleach, and anti-bacterial wipes) but have found the odor to be overwhelming and ever present regardless of disinfectant or frequent bag changes. Recently in a popular parenting magazine, they reviewed various diaper disposal systems and used Limburger cheese (a very potent and stinky cheese) to measure odor levels among the various systems. Diaper Champ received the worst rating for odor (4 cheese wedges indicating the worst odor rating possible.) I would avoid the hassle, spend a few extra bucks and get one of the other, higher-rated and popular systems."
102402,1,"This Musical Mobile has been an excellent choice for my baby. She really enjoys it: sounds, lights and movement!!! Music selection is wonderful, however, volume should be a improved to a little more higher than the one it is sold nowadays"
71642,1,"We received this as a shower gift and it has really been nice. I definitely can't see spending big bucks for the Bjorn. This one is just as good. I used it quite a bit when our daughter was a newborn. She wanted to be close to me but I still had to get stuff done around the house too. It worked great because she wasn't very heavy. Now that she is 18 lbs. it gets a bit heavy, but she still seems to enjoy it. It is especially nice to use on days that are still a bit chilly but you want to go for a walk - baby is right there next to you keeping warm. The most important thing I have found is to make sure the straps are criss-crossing low enough on your back (as the manual states). If they are too high you will be uncomfortable."
181083,0,"It is a great playing space for infants, my little one loves it. However, it has a few shortcomings. First, we received it with a defect: on two out if three settings, the music just stops playing after a few seconds, you have to hit the bars to restart it, but it keeps doing that.So for us only one setting worked - it was ok since it plays the full musical sequence. The defect was annoying until we discovered that one setting actually works.The second shortcoming is that the birds/butterflies hanging from the top don't rotate. I don't know if they were meant to, and we have another defect or it was by design, but in either case it would be great if it did. Babies like moving things, and it could develop their eye movement and keep them entertained longer."
106589,1,"I read all the reviews before purchasing the champ instead of the genie. Many of the complaints about this pail was the smell. We have this pail in our bedroom and I can assure you that if it smelled bad, it would be removed. My recommendation to everyone- wrap the diaper up as tight as possible (you know how you roll it up and fasten the velcro to form a ball).You will have NO smell.Don't waste money on &quot;special&quot; bags."
158004,1,"I broke down and bought this after 2 months of not being able to sleep for fear of something happening to my baby. Suffice it to say I was a very anxious first time mom (and still am!). After we bought this, I finally had piece of mind enough to SLEEP! We had no problems with false alarms, except when we took her out of her crib and forgot to turn the monitor off. The movement plate does need to be on a hard surface, but that was an easy fix with a $5 piece of plywood from Home Depot. It worked well in our pack and play and our crib at home."
68114,0,"I bought this valance to go in my son's nursery and it's cute but it's not the best quality. The length from top to bottom is not that long at all, it looks like it was made too short. Also, there is no lining it's just a few pieces of fabric. It was made very cheaply. The only reason that I am keeping it, is because the colors match the bedding set we put in the nursery. I might order another one just to add more depth to it, up to our window. I know to order another curtain sounds ludacris when this is not a rave review - but have you ever heard just going with what you have and making it work. That's pretty much where I am with it considering the fact that our little guy will be here in just a few short weeks, just want to check certain things off of my list."
51377,0,"I can't speak for how well these work, but it is a super cute diaper!"
161868,2,"I registered for this tub, and received it as a gift. In the beginning, it was ok, but as he got older he started to slide down the sling everytime he kicks or moves, what a hassle to keep sliding him back up, so his ears don't get in the water. Now he is 5 1/2 months old and sitting up to take a bath, well this one is very inconvenient for babies sitting up, because it's hard to wash their bottoms. And, if you try to lay him on the sling, he just twists and turns to sit up. I never had problems with leaks, but the bottom suction cups broke off. Please don't buy this product."
77041,1,"My son LOVES this swing - you can hear him laughing and cooing at the mobile and the stars. I would give this 5 stars if it wasn't for the dang clicking noise the mobile started making after about 3 weeks of use. I called Fisher Price and they said it needs a new motor housing, but they didn't have any left. Since it has a one year warranty, they said they would gladly send me a new one. However, I would have to send my seat back to them and it would take up to 6 weeks to get the new one. I can't deny my little man his swing for that long.I would suggest that if you buy this, hold onto the box so if yours starts acting up, you can return/exchange it. Most retailers won't let you return it without the box."
998,1,"I have always found Pampers to be a good diaper, but the overwhelming smell kills me! They don't leak and haven't given my son any rashes, so I suppose until I find something as good with a good price I'll be sticking to Pampers."
62556,2,"The Diaper Genie was a gift 2 years ago when I had my son, and we thought it was the way to go. It's pretty good at holding in odors, I'll give it that. But it's difficult to use: open this, push that, shove the diaper down (without having it leak on your hand!), twist the thingie, close the lid..... Family and babysitters can never figure it out, so the diapers are left sitting on top of the lid. The mechanism that cuts the ""sausage"" of a bag with the dirty diapers in it warped almost right away, making cutting and changing the refill cartridges difficult. The refill cartridges get expensive, $4-$6 each depending on where you shop, and you have to change it about every 2 - 3 weeks based on single toddler use. We bought a Diaper Champ last week on a friend's recommendation (because the lid of the Genie snapped backwards, and baby #2 is due next month!!), and we LOVE it. Check it out instead."
69757,1,"excellent product, I recommend it seems very good quality was what I needed excellent excellent excellent excellent product, I recommend it seems very good quality was what I needed excellent excellent excellent"
113434,1,"We use this for both my 2.5 year old and my 10 month old. It is very easy to set up and just as easy to fold up for travel or storage. The trays snap on and off easily but stay secure enough so that the toddlers can not easily remove them. It's very comfortable for the kids and extremely sturdy. Very well designed. It is fantastic for travelling to grandma's house, going on holiday, or using it on a daily basis."
175881,1,"Very happy with my purchase of the K'Tan. My 2 month old will fuss for a tiny bit at first, and then fall fast asleep, just as she did at 1 month old. The online videos are extremely helpful. Material is sturdy and washes well. Their sizing chart was accurate for me. I'm fluctuating between 125-130lbs, and I'm 5'4&#34;, and the xs is just right. A little tight at first but stretches nicely and supports my daughter well. Very happy I bit the bullet and purchased this."
45291,1,My baby loves to play with this. I used this almost right away. Great colors and music. You will be sooo proud when your baby first reaches for the toys!!!!
112815,1,"Used cloth for first 2 months with Tushies at night which worked out great. Started using Tushies exclusively after that. Like the diaper, gel free, soft and comfortable, but don't believe the size if your baby is chubby. We bought way too many small size that supposedly go to 14 lbs. Our girl was 12lb13oz at 2 months and hard to get a tight fit at the waist. Had a couple leaks. Now she is pooing only 2-3 times a day seems she has a blow out about once daily out the leg or back - reason only giving 4 stars. Hopefully the medium size will fit better."
143372,0,"Useful ToolsThey come handy for washing and cleaning narrow items such as bottle straws, machinery and guns' parts. They are not heavy duty but they will do the job."
158146,1,"I thought it's time to write a review for this monitor. I got it with my first child three years ago. I now have my second child and love the peace of mind it brings us. Both of my boys were belly sleepers. This monitor would allow me to put them in their crib on their bellies without worrying about burying their faces. Yesterday morning the alarm went off. Before I got in the room the alarm turned off. I checked the baby (11 weeks old) and he was breathing and he his head was turned to the side so I could see he had plenty of air. The only thing I can think that happened was he stopped breathing long enough to trigger the alarm and the beeping was enough to startle him to start breathing again. This monitor is worth the price for any parent. Even when the baby wiggles his way up to the top of the crib, the monitor can still pick up his light breathing.I wouldn't plan on it being your only type of monitor. The parent units get too much static. We quickly stopped using those with my first child and only turn on the base when the baby is in his crib. Also, it doesn't work well if you have an incline in the crib. When our first child began to sleep in his crib we had him on an incline. The monitor couldn't pick up his light breathing with both the matress and his incline and would falsely go off.I also have a video monitor that i can view on my phone. Between these two monitors I have so much peace of mind."
170775,2,"I AM HAVING A CHILD IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS, SO I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BUY MYSELF A FEW SHEETS FOR THE PACK N PLAY. SORRY BUT UNHAPPY MOM TO BE I AM. I WOULD RATHER STICK WITH DRU_MO_CE WONDERFUL SHEETS--SHE HAS A VERY NICE SELECTION AND A FREE MONOGRAM OF YOUR CHILD'S NAME. LOOK HER UP ON EBAY, YOU TOO WOULD BE A VERY HAPPY CAMPER."
42108,2,"This is supposed to be a LEAK proof cup....NOT! My daughter had water all over herself from it leaking. No matter how tight I tighten the lid it still leaked from there. And on top of that, the lid is a PAIN to take off. The plastic get slippery to hold when wet and the handle makes it difficult to get a good grip to unscrew the cap. I would definitely NOT buy another one of these cups. Don't waste you money."
171554,1,"We were given a tub, Safety 1st Infant to Toddler stages tub, that I'd placed on my baby registry, and it just never fit our long baby very well. So while out shopping we noticed this tub.It has a nice area to hold shampoo or drape washcloths. It has a very thoughtful water catching plastic lip behind the seat, so that when we are rinsing baby's hair with a washcloth, excess water that gets squeezed out drips back down into the tub.All you parents know however that, that's no gaurantee you won't get water splashed outside the tub from a happy, mobile baby! ;)In the last tub, baby stubbed his toe against a sharp plastic lip, and boy did that make him MAD! This tub is all gentle curves and no sharp angled surfaces.I really like the built in drain plug that turns from GREEN to WHITE if the water is ""TOO HOT!!"" for baby. Veeerrrry thoughtful feature.Our baby is a long baby and so the infant hammock never fit him, even before 1 month old, and it seems a little cheesy to be honest, but it's probably great for baby's under 8 lbs.Baby reclines comfortably in this tub, and doesn't slide around as much as he did in the other tub, both have a foam or rubber backing that is meant to prevent slip sliding by baby.We love this tub, and are looking forward to it's continued use through the toddler years."
129603,1,My 6 month old baby enjoys playing with this toy. It is easy for her to grip and hold on to. Overall a good purchase.
102480,1,My daughter loves this mobile. The characters are so cute and the motion of the leaves keeps her interested in it.
176748,2,"I was very disappointed with this bottle warmer. The warmed bottle tempature was very inconsistent...ranging from scalding hot to just about warm. (even when using the same amount of water with the same size bottle each time!) If the bottle isn't warm enough, it is difficult to reset the warmer to rewarm the bottle-the button just won't go back down until the unit cools down. I also had a problem with the warmer not automatically shutting off as it was supposed to, which resulted in the bottle over-heating and exploding all over my kitchen...electricity and liquid-not a good combination. Very dangerous! Luckily, My baby and I were not in the room at the time.I found the cooler portion of the unit to not keep the bottles cold/cool throughout an 8 hour period as the box states.Overall, I was very disappointed with it and after the &quot;overheated exploding bottle episode&quot; I brought it back. I find it faster and safer to warm a bottle in hot tap water."
122052,1,"I did so much research before I put anything on my registry. I had my son on March 6 and have been using this since he was about a week old. My husband is a huge ""outdoor"" kind of guy who takes about a year to decide on anything because he needs to read every review known to man. He's the first one to be critical of the smallest things but this carrier is so impressive to him (and his favorite thing of everything from the shower)! All the straps make it very safe (and extremely comfortable for both daddy and baby). It allows you to carry the baby in several positions which is great. This carrier is definitely recommended... our baby either falls right asleep in it or just looks at the world around him while ""snuggling"" against his daddy's chest. =) A must have!"
28082,2,"I am using this product now as it seemed like a good idea at the time, but I would not have purchased it if I had put some thought into it. Firstly and I think this is a bit dangerous for exclusively breastfed babies, the ounces are off on the storage bags. I know I placed 3oz in the most recent bag but it comes up as 6oz in on the bag. This is not good especially if mom is not home and a caregiver might be fooled into believing they have enough milk on hand. Secondly, the storage bags are expensive. Ziploc snack size bags are much cheaper and I am going to try those to see if they fit so I can as least make the most of the small spaces."
149248,1,"I purchased this product because my husband works at night and even when he is in bed I have hot flashes so I needed the support without the heat. I confided with my many previously pregnant friends and they all told me to invest in a pregnacy pillow. After researching the many out there I decided I wanted one with multifunctions and comfort. I admit that when I read some of the reviews on this product I was very hesitant to buy but my discomfort made me try it. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! I didn't have half the problems a few of the others spoke of, my husband even drapes himself over it when I get up in the morning. Besides that, it's been a big help for me, I recently pulled a muscle in my abdomin and have been in pain, this pillow supports my belly so I won't aggrevate the muscle even more. I will swear by this product, even my four year old daughter loves it!"
125772,2,"I bought this pump because I have the Avent Isis Manual pump and love it, but going back to work part time I needed an electric of some type. Well, I have had the Isis IQ Uno Complete for two months and I no longer even bother using it. I get faster results and more milk as a whole with the manual. This pump lacks suction, due to what I would consider a design flaw. The mechanical part is incapable of imitating your own pumping because the range of movement it uses is too small. Either that or mine is defective. Either way, I am left with an unusable, unreturnable breast pump which neither Avent nor Babies R Us will do anything about, so I guess I just have to buy another pump. Please, do yourself a favor and don't bother with this pump."
122770,0,"This product is great, I have a 5 month old who has to take medicine every 8 hours so I needed something that made our life easier. The plunger is great and the pacifier part is much like that of the NUK pacifier. The idea is amazing, however it was really hard to open it after dispensing the medicine and sadly the pacifier broke at the hinge after only two weeks of use, making it impossible to use, the medicine would leak out. So while I think it's a great product it was way too expensive to break so quickly."
110317,1,"This is a wonderful chair. Very comfortable and glides easily. I put it together by myself in 30 minutes. (I really wanted to try it out before my husband got home!) All pieces were accounted for and nothing was broken (a complaint of some reviewers). As another reviewer said, I did have to look at the picture on Amazon to put the arm cushions on accurately since it wasn't part of the instructions. But after looking at the picture, it was easy. It does lock into a reclining position also. (One reviewer said it didn't recline.)The chair is very comfortable for me and my husband (we're both under 180 lbs), but if you need extra room, it might be a little snug. Dutalier chairs seemed to be wider when we were testing them in the store but they are much more expensive."
98097,1,"My husband and I weren't sure which to use,plain bottles or bottles with the bags in them. We chose the VentAire bottles. GREAT choice! They are wonderful! Our daughter has had no problems with these bottles! We decided not to breast feed and started her on the VentAire bottles right away, NEVER had a problem! There are different stage nipples to buy and they are perfect! Honestly I can't say enough about these bottles,we love them. We tried one other brand that was given to us as a gift. We tried the ""other"" brand before she was 2months old and she wouldn't take the bottle at all!We have learned there is nothing you can do about gas, all babies have it but you can cut down on it! Use the VentAire and you will see!!"
54058,0,I didn't really like or dislike this product. The mirror has a warped shape to it which makes hard to see the baby real clearly. I decided to buy a toy that went on my baby's crib and use it instead. It was a sassy product that has toys all over it and a BIG mirror in the front. I just attached that instead and can see perfectly.
107324,0,It does contain most of the odors but not all. It is however a huge hassle to open so beware if you value your manicures. It will save you money on refills so that's a plus.
122476,1,Easy to install! Took a black painted kids room and turned it into a miniature solar system that he just loves. Definite must buy!
144515,1,"I saw A few negative reviews, most were positive so I decided to try this product. I normally buy the Arm & Hammer lavender-baking soda bags. However, these bags are also scented and there are tons more. The baby powder scent is a bit generic smelling, but we're not eating them we are using them to throw away waste and they do conceal bad odors. The plastic is as thick as a grocery store bags. They are a decent size, as I use these for my baby's diapers and my dog's dirty pads (I double the bag for my shepherd). I will buy these from now on!"
59570,0,"These locks are the best solutions I've tried, for many applications, but compared to the others they are also VERY DIFFICULT TO INSTALL. I am a carpenter but don't mean to say you can't install them with modest skills -- yet there are many opportunities to mess up by misaligning the pieces, tearing up the wood, stripping the screws, or drilling through the drawer/door front -- it is necessary to drill from the back to within ONE EIGHTH INCH of the front. Sure you can do it, with care, but care takes time and we all have bad days. I think they should give you a drill bit and stop, or at least sell one alongside the locks.They should insist that EVERYONE GET AT LEAST TWO KEYS because you *will* either lose one (perhaps to a curious toddler) or, my weakness, lock the key in the cabinet or drawer. Next, the locks are not very adaptable to the many drawer and door configurations out there for lack of a surface to mount, clearance to moving parts, or tight quarters difficulty maneuvering the drill where it needs to be. They also don't need to use these irritatingly small screws (#4's?).When these magnetic locks work right, they are a dream. We have one on the hallway medicine cabinet that has been working flawlessly for seven years. But being the best is not always enough, and it is on installation that these stumble."
142145,1,"Okay, I'm a huge geek and I went to baby stores and tried LOTS of carriers on (with my baby in them). We have two Snuglis (one a hand-me-down and the other for the hubby around the house) but this is my carrier of choice.Make sure to read the instructions and adjust the back support properly (*this may take a while to get right, but you'll feel the difference*) and you'll have a lot less back pressure than with other soft carriers.My baby loves this carrier- especially now that he can face forward in it. I also recommend the Baby Bjorn Carrier Cover to keep baby warm and dry in inclement weather."
129658,1,I bought this toy for my 4 month old granddaughter.She loves it and it goes everywhere with her. It is small enough for her to hang on to and she chews on it steady. She is now 6 months and teething so this toy is a life saver. I would recommend this toy for any infant. It is the best.
151941,1,So far it keeps the doors closed so my almost 3 year old can't destroy his closet when he is supposed to be napping. It does allow it to open just a smidgen & fingers could get pinched. I don't think that can be avoided without locking the doors. For the price it does the job.
21540,2,"But thats all. I hate to return this bouncer its so pretty! I am not happy with the mobile its too far above head for my baby to even know its there. The two side rattles are hard plastic not soft, and when my baby gets excited and kicks her feet, her knees bump the rattle holders and they are not soft either."
106436,1,"The Diaper Champ is wonderful. You can use regular garbage bags and it does not allow diaper smells to enter the room. What else could a new mommy ask for?Let's face it, having a child is not cheap. Having to buy special bags for dirty diapers does not help the pocketbook like you have to do with the Diaper Genie. Experience with the Genie not working at a friend's house forced us both to look at all other options. It seems the Genie has a corner on this market but we'd hope the Champ starts taking over. It's a wonderful product. The Diaper Champ is highly recommended."
139309,1,"Cloud b Twilight Turtle - Constellation Night LightMy Grand-daughter loves Mr.Cloud B.Turtle,he's soft underneath, and lights up her night.Shuts off automatically. Helps her sleep alone."
171100,1,I wanted a photo book for our son to see friends and family. It's a great way to keep them aquainted with faces they don't see too often! He loves it and I love the make of the book.
14899,2,"These bottles leak at random and usually it is when my son has nice clean clothes on. He is almost 1 and I used these for past few months, I will not use with my next child."
74457,1,"My son was ready to graduate to all metal flatware but our adult set was just to big for him to handle easily. This set was just what we were looking for. Seems to be high quality and my son immediately took a step forward in eating independently. I wish the price was a bit less, nearly $7 per piece seems a bit steep to me."
138075,1,"Got this as a Christmas gift and love it! We turn it on so our little one can fall asleep. He was in the NICU for several weeks, so he's not used to a super dark room. Makes it easy to check on him, too. Love the calming green and blue colors. We have it on a nightstand, and it looks great. Expensive for a nightlight, but so relaxing and beautiful on the ceiling, and much easier than those glow-in-the dark stickers!"
156199,2,I loved this swing from 1st sight as the colors were gorgeous and it had a higher weight limit than most. This all went away the minute I took it out of the box to put it together. It was difficult to put together as none of the pieces were marked and the directions were very unclear. Plus the tray did not fit securely and came off after several openings. Also the restraint is very flimsy.
178451,0,"I have a baby bjorn that was a hand me down. It was great until my baby reached 10 lbs. After that, I can only carry him for 10min without hurting my back. My friend told me about the ergo baby carrier and I tried it. I love it! It comes with an infant insert for babies &lt;3mo but I didn't use it b/c mine was older than that. The great thing is that it sits on your waist and distributes the weight on your waist instead of your back. He's 21lbs now and I still carry him without any problems. You can't face the baby out but he doesn't seem to mind facing me. The maximum weight you can carry is 40lbs. You can also use it to carry your baby/toddler on your back or side. I haven't tried the back but it seems like it would be good for hiking since the big backpack carriers are so bulky and heavy."
159377,0,"First, let me say that I love my bouncer seat. It is an absolute must for any mother who wants to have a few minutes of baby-free arms. It's great for feeding a baby who can't sit up on their own yet to be in a high chair. It's great to sit and ""chat"" and play with a baby, with both hand free. It's even great to watch Baby Einstein.The bouncer itself is great, and I LOVE the vibration feature (although it does seem to induce blow outs in my little girl more often than it lulls her to sleep).BUT... the toy bar has these hanging toys that hurt her knees. I thought it would be great to have something for her to kick at... and it is. But they are made out of really hard plastic, and hang so that she can't kick at all without banging her knees on them. And if you attach the ""so-called"" teethers (which are just hard plastic, and not really helpful for teething babies at all), the edges of the toys are banging on her knees.Also, the toys can ONLY be kicked at. They are attached to the toy bar in such a way that the baby can't reach them without sitting up, and I can't push them towards her enough for her hands to reach them.The bubbles and sounds from the toy bar are great, and she loves to watch the fishes and starfish move. But the hanging toys need to be replaced with something a little less painful."
59213,1,"I must admit initially, my husband got to use the bottle warmer more than me. He was getting up to do the night time feedings, while I breastfed during the day. However, now that we are starting to eat cereal, I use it to warm up the breastmilk and it is quick and easy. Yes, it does not have on on/off switch, but it is so simple to use. The milk warms to a the correct temperature, fast. Worth the money."
132265,0,"The shade matches the bedding very well. My single-mom daughter ordered it, wanting her baby's nursery to be perfect. It looks great and she's very pleased with how it looks on the $8 lamp base we found at WalMart. However, the shipping cost was ridiculous - the seller doesn't make it clear at all as to how the shipping is computed. The final cost of the shade with shipping was almost $40 - way too much!!! Will not buy from this seller again!!"
152788,1,Daughter loves it. She is almost 3. She can even sleep comfortably in it without her head flopping all over the place
15551,1,"Somehow the gate gods were smiling at me the day I bought this gate. I have 5 dogs, and I can't keep them out of the dining area. the width of the opening from the dining area to the family room was 130 inches, and this gate opens up to 144inches. I had to find out this information from the reviews....as amazon doesn't really post a description about the products..unless I'm missing something.anywayLOVE this gate! It's cute and keeps out my 5 beasts!"
8193,1,"This is a good buy at an affordable price, necessary for everybody with an infant, or toddler still in diapers. Bright colors appeal to the wee ones."
137973,1,This product is wonderful. It shows bright stars on the ceiling. I was skeptical at first but it really works. I recommend it.
102178,0,"It was a gift, so I really can't say much about it."
51776,1,"The rug is cute, one thing I wanted to mention was the one I was sent had an orange rim around it instead of blue. Otherwise it's a good looking small nursery rug that goes great w/the collection."
82246,1,"This lock works great for our lazy susan. It was easy for my husband to install, and we don't find it hard to turn the latch. Well, I should say that it doesn't cause me any strife; it is tough enough to keep the toddlers out! The only thing that is a pain is only being able to turn the cabinet one way. In my opinion it doesn't bother me NEARLY as much as having my kids tearing apart the cabinet all day long. Pleased with it overall!"
130871,1,My daughter love's this swing. She could spend hours in it. She loves staring up at the fishes. Its sturdy and so far we have had it for 3 months without any problems. Definately worth the money.
136899,1,"Bright Starts Musical Melodies Bouncer is a wonderful baby bouncy seat. It can go from a sitting up position to fully recline, and with the addition of music (2 volume settings) and vibration, it is wonderfully soothing. The toy bar is easy on and off and toys can be switched around or interchanged. My grandaughter loves it! And all at a very affordable price. I definitely recommend this baby seat!"
27799,1,"We are very happy with this stroller- especially for the price! Even though it is not officially intended for use with the Graco Snugride infant carriers, our oldest daughter (22 months) fits snuggly into the stroller next to our youngest (2 months) when in the carrier. The stroller folds compactly enough that it fits into the back of our '05 Chevy Equinox and our '06 Kia Sedona, with plenty of room to spare. The recline is easy and individual to each seat, which is helpful with a young baby. We are able to easily fold and unfold for short errands in and out of the car. Only complaint is that the tires were flat upon arrival. We are happy to have this as our second double stroller!"
105896,1,"At first me and my husband didnt know if we really wanted to get diaper pails for our twins. We thought since the babies were going to be at his parents house while we were at work. A garbage can would do just as well. We did reg for the diaper champ to keep at the grandparents house. We ended up getting 1 for their home and 2 for our home. We are SO HAPPY we did. They are so easy to use. You dont have to push the dirty diaper down with your hand you just lay it in the champ and turn the handle over. At 6 months old yes the diapers are starting to get bigger but you just fold them with the velco of the diapers and its so easy. Ive had no problems of getting them stuck. With the diaper champ you can use any kind of bags which is great!!! There really is no oder with the diaper champ. We take the dirty diaper out every 4-5 days depends on how many we go through in a weeks time :), but even when their is a ""dirty"" diaper there is no smell in the room. Sometimes if we have a very ""messy diaper"" we just take it directly to the garage. All around we have had NO problems and neither has grapa and grama. We wash it out once a month or sooner with bleach and water just help get rid of some germs. We also spray it with cleaner weekly to help with those nasty germs! All around its a great product. It really is hands free, which means less mess, and their is no costly replacement bags that you have to mess around with!"
95259,1,"It seems that when you get pregnant so do the people around you, luckily enough I was near the end of the baby-makers and they informed me what didn't work for them...this moniter[inexpensive]and was all we needed for our home. The clarity is so good that I can sometimes hear my son breathing at night! The volume gets very loud, my son's room is next to a window, and one night we had it so loud that when a car whizzed by we just about jumped out of our bed! So many friends brought the expensive fancy ones and regretted it, I'm happy I made the right choice the first time around."
171063,1,I purchased this book for my son's first birthday and filled it full of pictures of his cousins grandparents siblings etc. you can put pics on the front and back of the page and there are quite a few pages (10 I think??). The exterior is durable and cute. Overall it has held its form really well. The plastic pages haven't gotten crinkled and he's had it for a year and looks at it all the time. The mirror page in the back is terrible quality but its not a big deal. Thinking of buying another book for more pics of friends and playmates. Happy with this purchase!
195,1,I keep buying this type of pampers because I've read many reviews about the bad chemical smell of dry maxx pampers.
147729,0,"We bought this car seat because of the great review in the Baby Bargains book, and for the clean styling. After spending an hour trying to install it, we figured out that the LATCH system only works if you have the LATCH system installed on the BOTTOM of your car seat (not the latches behind the back seat head rests). Our car does not have the LATCH system at the top AND bottom of the seat. That is an *extra* updated feature.We figred there had to be another way to install it without using the LATCH system...we went to the Highway Patrol who proceeded to tell us that there is a way to install it, but since our seats aren't flat enough in the back, the car seat won't work in our car anyway. Our car is an '02 Audi A4 - pretty common size in cars, I think.Not really worth the money. The Highway Patrol said that he prefers (for safety reasons) the Evenflo car seats - but this one is a safe car seat if it fits right. Now I have to buy another car seat AND stroller since it went together with the Aria stroller...."
51168,1,"My husband bought this for me as soon as I started tossing &amp; turning a lot and complaining about lower back pain during pregnancy (around 4 mos.) B/c it simultaneously keeps your legs separated and supports your belly, somehow you stay aligned thus relieving back pain. I'm 8.5 mos. pregnant now, and always sleep with it, and bring it with me if we go away for the weekend. A couple of times I've forgotten it but without it I invariably wake up with back pain, so I owe it to the Snoogle for alleviating it.Another good thing...I am mainly a back sleeper and because that's not recommended during pregnancy, I sometimes turn from my side so that I'm at an angle, but resting my back on the long back part of the Snoogle. This is very comfortable, almost as much as back sleeping, but without the pressure.I think the C-shape is intended so that you sleep on your left side, as recommended, but truthfully that is difficult for all the months of being pregnant. I will flip to my right side and use it the same way, but it is cumbersome switching, though not altogether impossible. This is a minor complaint thought, when compared with the overall rest that I am able to get.All in all, it's been worth the money."
4058,1,I love the Regalo Hide Away Bed Rail! It was fairly easy to put together. The best part is that it's given my almost three year old the security she needs to be able to sleep in her own bed. It's a wonderful thing when you can make something for your little one feel like it was their idea and it works!! Highly recommended and Economical cost!!!
64861,1,"I thought this was a great idea to have a portable swing. Since we visit family often, and he loved his regular swing at home, I thought that this would be a great addition to his baby gear. I thought it would be neat to be able to move this swing to wherever it might be needed in the house, and I first tried it out when my son was was about a few weeks old. I don't think that this swing is good for newborns as there doesn't seem to be enough support for them. Also, he did fall asleep in it (and even batted at the toys a couple times!), but his neck was so bent that I had a neckache just looking at him.Now that he's 4 months old, I leave this in my office for when I take him to work with me. He doesn't seem to like it when he's sleepy. He likes to play with the toys but seems to get bored easily. He also won't sleep in it, which was one of the big reasons why I bought it. Also, when I fold it up, it is a bit confusing and doesn't seem to stand against the wall very well. It just keeps toppling over, so I leave it unfolded.I gave this product 4 stars because although my son doesn't seem to like it too much, I think it's a great idea and seems to be built well. I think that my son is just picky, and hard to get to sleep anyway...LOL"
182787,0,"We needed a narrow car seat so that we could put three car seats side by side for our 5 year old, 3 year old, and infant. This one is nice and slim. It seems to have good cushioning. It has a pad that is supposed to function as a ""spill guard"" that the child sits on. However, this spill guard doesn't snap or velcro down - it basically floats free.The strap for the bottom buckle doesn't adjust. There is only one slot for it, unlike on other car seats. This means that as your child grows you won't be able to adjust the strap (although the shoulder straps do have several different heights)."
125305,1,"Low price.Works as advertised.From 4 months on, my little boy was using it properly as soon as he received it.At 5.8 months, it is a saving grace!"
13092,2,"There is a review on this site saying the reason CPSTs don't recommend this is because then we'd be out of a job. No, the reason we don't recommend these is because they're unsafe and do more harm than good.The instructions for this product actually negate the use of it. It says &quot;instsall per carseat manufacturer's instructions&quot; and then put this on afterwards. If you install the seat following the manufacturer's directions not only will you not need this product, you'll also note that it says not to add after market products to your seat.Hrm.I'm one CPST who won't be losing their job by this product flying off the shelves. I'm a volunteer who pays for my travel, training and certification out of my own pocket. And I still don't like the Mighty Tite.If you are having trouble getting your carseat installed correctly, contact a technician in your area. They can be found via the Safe Kids website www.safekids.org or through NHTSA www.nhtsa.gov most will more than happy to meet with you and help you learn to install your seat safely and correctly and without the use of an aftermarket product such as this."
13620,1,Love this! Bought in 02 for our first baby. Now due in July with our 3rd and it as held up well! No complaints.
118151,1,I love this stroller. It is so lightweight and it folds up so nicely. I would recommend it to anyone.
131739,2,"I have been driven completely bananas trying to get this sunshade to stay on - as soon as you get the top stretched over, the bottom flicks off (and vice versa) And I'm not alone - everyone I meet has had the same problem with the shade, its about 5cm too short and this makes it practically unusable.I also live in Queensland Australia. I don't know about northern hemisphere sun but silver does nothing to block it out over here. I have resorted to a black piece of sheet instead which works much better."
65313,1,"Works just as expected, simple install, love the deep cup holder pockets & the BOB can still be folded down without a problem. It's a must have."
171578,0,The sling worked great for a couple of weeks when my son was a newborn but he quickly outgrew it. The divider in the middle of the tub was always poking him in the back even with the straps adjusted correctly. I can't get him to fit properly in the reclined infant side (he's 4 mos) and he can't sit up in the toddler side. He's very active and his bottom won't stay in the alloted space behind the divider. He pushes his feet against the tub so that his bottom comes up and rests on the divider. That divider is always in the way. I would rather have a tub without sections.
172983,1,"Now, here's something strange. Once you get to this size, they are more absorbent than Pampers. Why, I have no idea but that's how it worked in our house. I have used Pampers since the newborn stage but now these work better during the toddler stage. I still use Pampers at night sometimes, but these are just awesome diapers and I wouldn't be without them."
58230,1,"I purchased this for my daughter and son-in-law who are expecting their first baby this year. My daughter wanted one, and I didn't know it but I bought it for them and my first grandchild. It is very nice, and we can't wait to put it to good use."
92226,1,"I am a new mom and needed to find a bottle for feeding my little one stored breast milk. Babies R Us recommended the BreastFlow system and it has worked wonders! In fact, my baby can go from the bottle to breast and back with no fuss or confusion. In fact, after using the bottle, she latches on so much easier. The two part nipple simulates the milk flow of the breast and really does make it easy to nurse and feel confident in giving my baby a bottle with expressed breast milk. We are going to recommend this bottle system to everyone we know."
904,1,"I have a long and lean 18 mo old boy who has not yet graduated to size 4 due to the leg openings being too large, causing leaks. He's very active and since I have to go with a size 3, these diapers work great for leaks."
112891,1,I am happy knowing that these wipes are safe to use on my kids. However I am disappointed that they are so small. They are thick enough to make them worth using though.
114596,1,"This is, by far, one of our best baby items! We don't have a regular, full-sized high chair. We have used this seat since we started giving our daughter solids at 6m. It is super portable for trips to the Grandparents' houses and easy to clean. As it's been said, no cracks or crevices for food to get into. We stopped using the inset tray because our daughter started to pull it off - with food on it! I like that the bigger tray can also go in the dishwasher (I just be sure and use air dry) even tho it just takes a quick wipe to clean. You really don't need a full sized chair - this will work great! The only problem might be if you have a bigger toddler since you can't adjust the tray height, but at that point, you can probably just use it at the table. I LOVE THIS SEAT!"
136179,0,"I did not pick this saucer out, and I wish I had checked it out before opening it and putting it together. It LOOKS like it has so many toys... but 3 of them are just these butterfly things that hold the legs on and basically do nothing. The rest of the toys are good, and the music isn't annoying, so I will give it that. I would much rather have traded it in for something with more toys to play with, or something that will turn into a walker so my daughter could get more use out of it."
16039,0,"I bought them for $5.00 at the baby sale about a year ago and that was fine, but this new price is insane."
82469,2,"My overall impression so far is negative. The dresser does not scream quality. As of now I can not even put it together because one of the rear panels that was shipped is ~ 1 inch longer than the rest, so that with it installed I can not put the dresser together. Without it, I am afraid,the dresser might be unstable. I ordered the replacement (themdbfamily.com), so if/when it arrives I will update this review.Quality-wise it is nowhere near the Davinci Kalani crib. It is the same price so I wonder if it is due to the lack of regulation. It is hardly more wood than the crib. We were debating between Kalani dresser and Roxanne and went for Roxane because of its smaller size.Drawers: The back and sides are made of very low density wood, so be careful and do not apply too much torque to the wood screws when you put them together. I am worried that these parts will warp from humidity. The bottoms of the drawers are made from some composite material and do not strike me as too strong. When put together the drawers have some give and do not stay rigidly square which makes me wonder if the dresser itself is going to be stable when put together. The rails are OK.Side panels of the dresser are made from particle board, but the label states that formaldehyde level is satisfactory by California standards.The finish is nice and seem to match the Kalani Espresso Crib finish.I will update the review when I finish the assembly."
33456,1,Arrived on time and works as stated. I would recommend this gate for kids and pets.They hate it but I like it!
21243,0,My husband and I found that the safety belt is very difficult to get unhooked. Also the tray is very difficult to unhook. The swing is beautiful and looks great in our home...but not worth the hassle of the other features.
142331,0,"Although I like the product, there are a few flaws. First I will say that the suction does work great, I could lift a table with it. The problem is that #1, it only took my 18 month old daughter 2 days to figure out how to work the lever which releases the suction. My suggestion is to make sure that the lever is always facing away from your child. They will probably still figure it out but it may take them a while longer. The second problem is that the base is so tall that it puts the dish up pretty high. My daughter could not see into the bowl so she was just stabbing away unsuccessfully with her fork. If your high chair tray is low enough then that won't be such a problem. I think I would have had better luck if I'd have starting using it sooner than 18 months and if the tray was lower. I'd say start them out with it at 12 months and it should work well."
144490,0,"When I was expecting, I had no clue what was needed and what was not needed. Based on many lists available in amazon and raving reviews of these disposable diaper sacks, I purchased 200 count box. I must have used about 20-30 bags in the first month. I slowly realized these were not needed at all.Now my son is 6 month old and his poop is no longer liquidy. I flush his poop and throw his diaper in normal trash. Trash goes out twice a week. We don't have any bad smell due to diaper accumulation.I still use these while i am out, only because I have it at home. Had I not had these, I would have used Ziploc in stead.At home, in the first month, I could have used regular polythene that keeps accumulating from grocery shopping. I don't feel any difference between the two, except for a pleasant odor. Both regular polythene and sassy sack will contain odor to an extent, the added pleasant odor doesn't really make much difference in odor control. $9 down the drain."
43167,0,"Given the price, I didn't expect this to be a dream to push or very stylish, for that matter. That said, you can't get around the fact that if your baby likes to sleep in the car, it's great to be able to pop their car seat into the stroller without waking them. For that reason, I'll probably be using this as long as possible.BUT, we're only 1 month into winter weather and already the salt is rusting the wheels. If we're lucky we'll make it through the winter but do not expect this frame to last through a second child."
40853,1,"Our baby is a Pampers baby. Only problem I have noted is that Pampers diapers don't always hold up well for overnight especially if you child will sleep 10 hours straight. Otherwise, my husband and I are quite happy using Pampers."
15580,1,"We purchased this gate to fit around the base of an odd shaped staircase (for those interested, it's the front stairwell of the Wellington plan by Centex Homes - it's really popular down here in Centex subdivisions so I thought I'd share). I was concerned about finding anything that would cover this area because of odd shape but this gate did the job in spades. And it was a breeze to install (at least compared to some other gates). I had it installed within 1 hour. As is usual with these kind of things, if you are installing into sheetrock, be forewarned that the anchors that come with the gate hardware are pooky and you will need to buy some decent ones at the hardware store. That's really my only complaint, but it's seems to always be the case with any factory-provided hardware these days. We are very pleased with it and it was worth the money."
21955,1,"The dresser is extremely sturdy & easy to assemble. I put it together myself at 9 months pregnant & had only 1 small issue, which I resolved by using a phillips screwdriver with a longer handle in order to get more torque. In order to give the dresser a more polished look, I purchased different drawer knobs & everyone simply loves the dresser! It's not a tall 4-drawer but it is deep, which makes it more sturdy & to me a better choice for a baby's room because it is less likely to tilt. Overall, I am highly satisfied with my purchase."
14174,2,"These bottles come with an extra plastic piece on the inside. Most bottles do, except with the other bottles the plastic piece is disposable packaging. Don't make the mistake of throwing it away when you purchase AVENT Bottles or else you'll end up with a wet baby from the leaking bottle. Why purchase these more expensive bottles when you have an extra piece that needs to be washed and kept up with in order for them to function properly? I don't get it! I recommend Nuk bottles as a better plastic alternative."
11462,1,"I was satisfied with theFisher-Price Private Connection Monitor with Dual Receivers - White. I found the lights on the front of the receivers to be much more useful than I would have thought. We have a large 2 story house with the nursery upstairs on one end of the house and a theater room/game room in the basement. No matter where in the house I am, I never lose more than 1 bar of signal. And when I do feel like gaming or watching a movie late, I can turn the volume down on the receivers and be able to tell if there is noise coming from the nursery by the lights on the front of the reciever lighting up. An additional note, we have wireless internet and all phones in house are wireless, and I notice very little, IF ANY, static over the receivers. The only thing I regret about buying these is that we wouldn't have needed 2 receivers and could have got by no problem with one receiver."
129398,1,I bought this toy to enhance my 3 month old's grip development. It quickly became his absolute favorite. He's now 5 months and very grabby. He pretty much has to have something in his hands at all times. The Manhattan Toy Winkle keeps his little hands busy for hours! Definitely recommend i!
108688,2,"While I didn't have the problems others had with a broken frame, I was still very dissatisfied with the quality of the product.1) The blue background is so light that it looks more like a blueish grey than blue, the pink was fine but we were going to use the blue side.2) The clay is a horrible item to use for this purpose. The instructions tell you to roll it in aluminum foil. It stuck to the foil and repeatedly stuck to my son's foot (see additional uploaded photos) regardless of how thick or thin it was rolled out. What finally worked was to roll it between wax paper, let the clay dry for 5-10 minutes after you roll the material before you try to make an impression (this was not included in the instructions). I only found this out after we had already made about a dozen attempts and decided to use the scraps to experiment to make a hand print. Because we re-rolled the clay so many times, lint and dirt started to get embedded into the clay resulting in an unattractive print that we didn't want to frame.3) I would have expected a little form to keep the clay in a nice square/rectangle, cutting it with the supplied ruler was also a mess that stuck and deformed the print. After a day, the clay still did not completely dry and has the consistency of the stiffer marshmallows from Lucky Charms (firm but will dent with pressure).4) There is nothing special about the frame except it is thicker. To attach the clay they include double sided tape.I would not recommend this product. For the price you can easily go to a craft store and procure the same materials and have a much better end result. Personally, I would use artist clay to make a foot/hand impression first and cast that in plaster.Update: 30 November 2011I contacted Pearhead regarding the difficult time we had with the clay and that it was embedded with lint and stuff from being re-rolled. They responded in less than 12 hours and said that they would send out more clay to us. I originally rated this product as a 1, but because they had excellent customer service I wanted to upgrade my rating to between a 2 and a 3.Update: 02 January 2012Since my last update, they did not send replacement clay. I have since emailed the company two or three times and have received no response. I now would like to reduce the rating of this product to a zero if that were possible."
130785,1,"I received this swing as a shower gift and my son loves it! He loves to watch the mobile of fish above his head and had started following them at about two weeks old! I agree with another review that the speeds are too fast for new babies- we would turn it on the lowest speed and then turn it off after a few minutes and just let him rock and he was over 9 lbs at birth. Now at 3 months old, we still use the lowest speed. I would recommend this swing to any new parent! The side to side feature is great! Happy Swinging!"
42687,0,"I liked the Moby wrap; the few times I used it (I recently lost it) it was comfortable, easy to adjust. The only drawback is that it required 2 people (myself and someone else) to put my daughter in. And it was a bit on the bulky side."
33086,0,"I was very sore with cracked and bleeding nipples during my second week of nursing. I tried these shells, and did get some relief. It was nice to have something that let my nipples air dry and did not flatten them within my nursing bra. They do provide a nice contour under clothing. The silicone backing was not as flexible as I hoped it would be, and they put too much pressure on the areola around the nipple, which was equally uncomfortable. Because of this pressure, I also tended to leak more and the foam inserts were soaked in no time. Since there are holes in the top of the shells, you run the risk of having milk leak out the top anytime you bend over. I ended up returning them to the store due to discomfort wearing them for periods longer than 2 hours, and I simply toughed it out instead."
38909,1,"I registered for this after reading all of the great reviews and let me tell you, it is truly WONDERFUL! I use this along with my Infant to Toddler bathtub by evenflo and it fits perfectly. My daughter was rather small at birth (5lbs 3oz.) and she loves it. The first time I used the blue back support that came with the tub, but she seemed to feel so insecure. She spent the entire time grasping at air, looking for something to hold onto and sliding around. Since then I've always used this pillow and she sits there like a big girl! I no longer have to use one hand to hold her and one to bath her. Both hands are free. The pillow actually does stay warm (you'd think it would get cold when wet), and it does not mildew as mentioned before. All you have to do is hang it up high (shortly after using it) where it can drain properly with the hanger provided. The evenflo tub I have is a pretty big one and the safer bather sometimes sinks, but I've discoverd that I can use the little hanger that came with the pillow to keep the pillow from moving while in use. All you have to do is attach the hanger to the pillow and then put the hanger under the lip(edge) on the back of the tub. Now the safer bather will not move AT ALL! This is my second child and I have never found anything like it. I would absolutely recommend it, ESPECIALLY for little ones and newborns."
72512,1,"I have bought 2 of these. One for my home and one for my mother's home because she frequently watches my daughter. My daughter is 15 months and we have (slowly) been working on potty training her since she was able to stand on her own. The 5 year old I babysit uses it as a stool so he can wash his hands and reach the light switch. My daughter has no trouble opening it or sitting down on it. The front is contoured and raised slightly to keep urine from going the wrong direction. The opening is wide enough for her to pee and poop without hitting the seat but not so wide that she falls in. I love the fact that she will be able to use the seat on a regular toilet when she is taller. The cup for catching waste is easy to remove and clean, but not so easy that my daughter can remove it (yet). It is lightweight but sturdy.I think my only complaint about this potty is that it is kinda big. I have a small bathroom and it takes up a lot of space."
5860,1,"We bought these outlet covers to keep our puppy from chewing electrical cords. She's nearly 3 years old and had never done any cord chewing in the past, but one time is all that's needed. We put the outlet covers in any outlets around her areas (bed, crate, etc) and there haven't been any problems since. The 36-pack is helpful so you can use them in many outlets that aren't being used. Great product that works exactly as expected, price is good, delivery was fast and easy."
126919,0,"I bought these because they were on sale and had an amazon coupon. Even though they are a 1-2 I really don't feel they are any larger than Pampers size 1....so I will probably end up donating most of them because my baby boy is growing so fast, but thats not Huggies fault! They are okay diapers...I prefer pampers swaddlers with dry max though. This is totally superficial...but I don't like the ""blue tint"" and mickey designs on these dipes either. However, they did come out ot be significantly less expensive than Pampers...and for that...they are a pretty good deal! Hope I get to use most of them!"
104994,1,"What a relief for us to no longer have to worry that our toddler is going to crack her head open on the raised granite hearth in our living room. With the addition of this cusion, we now feel comfortable letting our toddler play with her toys on the hearth, which is the centralized place in our living area for her to be. Thanks for a great product!"
138290,1,"I bought one of these for my baby before he was born. He loves it! It has three different modes, green, blue, and amber. Each mode has actual constellations that show up. You can find them with the map in the box. The blue is the most soothing. It's the coolest thing. You can't appreciate it unless it's pitch dark. The stars will fill a big bedroom. I place it on a night stand near the center of the room next to my rocking chair. It has a timer on it. After forty minutes it shuts off."
41078,2,"We have used Pampers since the day my daughter was born. I am all for spending a little bit more to go for a brand I trust. And who wouldn't trust Pampers?! I used Swaddlers and then progressed to Cruisers with the mesh lining and never had a problem with leakage or rashes. In fact I thought it was the best diaper I have ever used. (I have used another competitor's diapers once and it always leaked on my daughter)Then came the day I noticed something was different in the diaper. It just felt different, almost cardboard-like and much thinner. Also the back lining didn't seem to go all the way to the top! Have I never noticed that?! Hmm, I didn't have anything to compare it to and diaper changing time isn't the best time to think - speed is crucial!! Afterwards I had a peak at the box it came in and it looked exactly the same as before. A few days later, the same niggling suspicion bugged me, especially after I noticed my daughter seemed to be scratching her back (where the diaper ends) a lot more than normal and wondered if something was irritating her skin. I googled it and lo and behold, read about how Pampers has changed the diaper design and took away the mesh lining! Ohhhh OF COURSE, the mesh lining!!! How could I forget that?! No wonder it looked different. I then started going through my pile of diapers and the diaper bag and found a couple of spare old diapers and compared them side by side. Now it looks pretty obvious. The mesh lining was gone, the lining stops a few inches before the top of the diaper (why!?), and it does feel thinner. Without the mesh lining, the new diaper felt 'scratchy' - that is the best way I can describe it. It just looked cheaper and less lush, less padded, and felt more uncomfortable to the touch.Although my daughter had not experienced a rash (or burn as some moms described their experience), which may be because we always put cream on her during a diaper change, we weren't planning on waiting around to find out. Plus I was furious that they deceived us by changing what is in the box of diapers we have grown to love, without any indication whatsoever! We started educating ourselves about chemicals in diapers and then decided to swap to another brand which does not use bleach in their diapers. We are happier to know that we are putting her in something hopefully safe.Why did Pampers have to change the design of something which was perfect? Why did they NOT inform the consumers of the change if it was as good as they claim it to be? Sneaking their best diaper technology YET into old boxes doesn't seem like a good marketing strategy, if any. It will take them a long time to earn back the trust of many moms. I know for sure they have lost my business.Please note that most reviews pre-2010 are 5 stars, and rightly so! However the sheer number of bad reviews dated 2010 is evidence that parents are not happy with the new diapers. Please be cautious and choose what is best for your baby."
40676,1,"I have tried so many differnt brands and styles of diapers, but nothing compares to Pampers. Especially Pampers Cruisers! I will never buy ANYTHING other than Pampers again. These diapers fit my baby boy perfectly, no sagging, no tearing, no leaking! Soft, Stretchy, and Durable! Great price too, lower than most discount stores. A must have for all babies! A++++"
88648,2,I only used pampers for my son when he was first born because they fit so well and were extremely absorbable! But after I lost my job I started buying the big boxes from Costco that are the kirkland brand diapers (which are basically the Huggies). I purchased these because of the price at the time with free shipping and the price of gas it turned out to cost just as much as those did. Well I will not be using these diapers for him anymore! They do not hold anything in! He goes to bed with a new/fresh diaper every night and by the time he wakes up 8-10 hours later he is completely soaked through! Never once did this happen with the Costco brand diapers...or pull ups! For 2 weeks now he has been soaking through every night and that is without liquids before bed! No more Pampers for me!
21373,1,We bought this for our 3 year old son (now 4). He has loved it since the first day and uses it almost every day. He has enjoyed it immensely. Now for the bad side. The mat is not very durable. After a few months the stitching between the elastic and mat came loose. I took it to a tarp shop and they sewed it back together. Mow the mat is splitting and will have to be replaced. And of course toys r us doesn't have the replacement mat so I'll have to find it elsewhere.
138686,0,"However, I purchased three and only two would work. I do plan to exchange when I can. The grandson's loved it!"
172583,2,I was under the impression that this tub had a working tub sprayer. I ended up returning 2 of them until finally getting one to work for only a couple of months. I figured I would suck it up and just use the cool net that holds my daughter up out of the water for at least 6 months or so until buying a new tub. Let me say that she has already outgrown this tub which should have lasted her through her toddler years. Oh and she's in the 25% for her age so you can't blame it on her size. The only reason I rated this product 2 stars was because it's little net did work and at least the product held water. If you still have the box take it back and go with the eurobath by primo. That's what I'm about to buy and I must say that is a TUB.
150579,0,"It was very easy to put together, not much of a hassle at all. It is a bulky stroller though so if your space is limited, I would suggest you look elsewhere. If space is not an issue, then definitely do yourself/baby a favor by purchasing this wonderful stroller."
73549,1,"I really love the gadget and it has been smth I carry around all the time. I like being able to track how much and when my baby eats as well as how much she sleeps. I honestly do admire the moms that can do it without it but your ability to track time does change when you have a baby. I would tend to disagree with some reviews regarding crying baby=hungry baby. Though not a believer in a strict schedule the baby does need some time or order otherwise a new mom's crazy life becomes even more crazy. Plus a crying baby does not always mean a hungry baby. Anyway overall I found this gadget useful. Only complaint, which probably aligns with a lot of complaints is I got my first item defective. The problem was though that it was a baby shower gift and I didn't open it right away and it was over 30 days to exchange/ return with Amazon. I did contact the manufacturer though and they were very nice to send me a replacement right away without me having to return the defective one first. And as such I bought one of these for my friend as a baby shower gift... hers ended up being defective too, and i say this is some poor quality control.In conclusion great gadget, poor quality product, good customer service from the manufacturer."
34763,0,"I wanted to love this seat, but I just couldn't. I bought it b/c a friend had it and loves it(she uses it forward facing though). Plus, it has a lot of really nice features. It was very difficult to install. To get it reclined enough for safety we had to put two pool noodles under it and it still wasn't quite there. Also, we had to push the front passenger seat of our Honda Accord ALL the way forward and totally upright. My daughter (who is 9 months old and outgrew her infant carrier b/c of height) didn't like it. The head rest tilts slightly forward which seems uncomfortable. After many fits from her and arguments with my husband we returned it and got the Evenflo Triumph. This seat reclines perfectly and my daughter feels more cozy and secure. Plus, it has a lot of the same features as the Alpha Omega."
141899,2,"The idea of this is really good. It comes in a roll, so you can cut it to whatever size your crib is. I used it on one of the short sides and the front, which is where my baby stared to chew. I used the adhesive like the directions stated, and let it set before I let my baby near it. He used it for about a week before it was off completely. Maybe it's not typical, but he got his bottom teeth under the gummi rail. So finally I took the rest of it off, and with it came the paint off the crib. Now my crib is missing giant chunks of paint and my baby is still chewing on it."
129138,1,"I have purchased several of the Toddler Bistro Boxes for family and friends. They all rave about how much good information is inside the little boxes. The box contains all kinds of helpful tips about serving sizes, dealing with picky toddler stages and great recipes for the whole family plus shopping tips on good brands if you don't have time to cook from recipes."
20955,2,I purchased this as a cute fathers day gift and after following the instructions I discovered that the clay sticks to everything even my baby's foot. The impressions never turned out. Needless to say it is being returned.
66284,1,"We just purchased this car seat, and we LOVE it. I have 2 children and a small car so size yet safety was important. My 7 year old fits comfy in the back next to this seat for my very lengthy 7 month old daughter. We were really amazed by how comfy it was for her. The recline position is great, even my 7 year old can adjust it. He will recline it when she falls asleep and then bring it forward when she awakens and wants to see everything. The 5 point harness is a great feature too. No more bulky over the head bars. My 7 year old had that kind when he was a baby and hated every minute of it. Its very hard to hold a ba-ba when that thing is stuck in front of you. So.... overall we found this one to be the best, we really spent a lot of time researching the many many models of car seats out there and this one BY FAR takes the prize. Evenflo triumph receives my highest recommendation!"
147898,1,"My daughter absolutely loved this toy when she was little. She could play with it for quite a while, which allowed me to get stuff done around the house (and take a shower!) in peace. I put this toy away after I thought she was getting too big, but my husband got it out one day when he was giving her a bottle. He put it next to the couch and now she uses it to crawl up and visit us. She's gotten more use out of this toy than any other baby shower gift!"
36124,0,I have be even using slings with my babies ( all 4) for 10 years now. I have had to replace many of them because I use them so often. I came across this one here and seeing that it was way affordable than the others that I wanted in this similar style I bought it. Just came in today with speedy shipping but saw the ring and was disappointed...like the other reviewers have said the thin ring is the wrong one for slings. It should be thicker. I am going to give it a try anyway but just based on the rings alone I see myself ordering a different one again elsewhere...
160705,1,"I haven't actually used this particular brand, but for those of you have not yet had a baby and tried to change the crib sheets this type of product is a must!!! It is easily removed and changed without having to remove the bumper pads (and practically the mattress) to get the little sheet off. You will probably never have to accomplish this Herculean task if you have a couple of these in the drawer. This has become my favorite shower gift for first time mothers."
22035,0,"I loved the older version of this product (the one that is pictured here and has a yellow swirl on the front). it works great!! it was easy to use, never leaked. The new version of the product has a major issue with the ziplock aspect of it. They made it skinnier and it doesn't seal as well. Look for the old boxes."
62985,1,"I ordered the Snoogle Mini because I really wanted all the features of a body pillow except I didn't want it to be under my head too. I wanted to keep the head pillow I am currently sleeping on. This was perfect for that! It is just the right size, not too small as other reviews have said. I am 5'7"" and average weight and I can put the very curly part between my knees and still hug the top. That may change as my pregnant belly expands, but I still expect to get good use out of this pillow.I did not find the cover too difficult. Or, rather, I should say my husband did not find the cover too difficult. As soon as the pillow arrived he insisted that we wash the cover before using it in our bed. I told him about all the reviews saying how hard it was to get the cover on and off. He peeled the cover off, washed it and stuck it back on. As long as you are systematic about putting it back on, you're fine.Also, I was able to stuff this size into a large tote bag and take it with me on a weekend trip to my in-laws. And it curls up so that I can lean against it to read in bed at night.I gave it four stars, not five, because some nights I feel like it is too thick between my knees and once I woke up with hip pain, but that might just be the way my body was changing or tweaking on that particular night.All in all, I am very happy with my purchase."
59909,1,"This is a great tub! A co worker told me about it, and I was hesitant to buy it at first (too costly). But after reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. Our baby (now 5 months old) is happier and comfortable. I had an inflatable one before (what was I thinking), so I got this one. Get it! It is great!"
54649,2,"I was so excited to recieve this mobile as a gift. However, it has already stopped working TWICE. I've contacted Tiny Love both times and have had the motor replaced, but my baby is only 3 months old! And we don't use it all day long. Usually, the only time my baby is in his crib awake is when I'm in the shower. He loves the colors and characters on the mobile, which is nice. But it's no fun for him to stare up at something that isn't moving at all. If I could redo my baby registry, I wouldn't bother with this mobile. For all the news about what a great item it is, it sure is a big disappointment."
36045,0,"I get the whole ""Take and Toss"" concept. These aren't meant to last forever, but I was really unimpressed with the lid/spout area. First off, my son hated sippy cups. We started trying to use them at 6 months to introduce different juices, and he very rarely ever willingly took a sippy cup. He actually, right around his 1st birthday, willingly drank from a straw, so we switched to those cups gladly. ANYHOW, with very light use and hand washing of these cups, all of the spouts started cracking. I think I have two of these left somewhere that made it, and God knows where that little blue plastic snap-on cover went. My son was always more interested in just playing with that piece than actually drinking from the darn cup. Also, these didn't leak very much at all, which I was impressed with considering the throw-away nature of these. Conclusion, these are definitely not going to be the only sippy cups you ever buy if you go with these. Infact, if I could do it all over again. I would have purchased different ones, not that I HATED these, but I certainly didn't love them."
118101,1,"I bought this for my grandson, who just turned three last month. He was ecstatic about the bed and couldn't wait for it to be assembled. He has been excited about it everyday since he started using it two weeks ago.Assembly was very straight forward, except the method of attaching the wheels to the body is a single screw and it is very difficult to hit the intended hole on the other side. Once attached the wheels are not very secure, and if you accidentally over tighten the screw (easily done since you are screwing into more plastic) you are out of luck.The bed comes with two particle board foundations for the mattress which lay horizontally across the sides and they are squared at the corners, but the headboard end of the bed is rounded, so the particle board foundation doesn't fit flush into the corners, causing the particle board foundation to overlap the bed's center support...this prevents the mattress from lying completely flat. Time to get out the router and trim the corners to fit.The box the bed came in is very large and took up most of my F-150's short bed...make sure you take a truck to the store if you plan on purchasing one of these beds. I purchased this from a Toys R Us store in Norfolk, Virginia. The store personnel were very friendly and helpful, which I find rare here in Virginia after being transplanted here from the Midwest three years ago.Make sure you purchase a quality mattress for this bed since you cannot use a box springs...take care of your kid's back!In my mind this is a much better value that the Little Tikes Sports Car Twin bed, which does not have all the cool decals that this one includes. The manufacture just needs to make a couple of minor improvements to make it near flawless."
104987,0,"queria probar el producto por eso lo compre, ademas quiero probar las demas fraganciasme gusto mucho. es muy buenolo recomendaria ampliamente es realmente un producto organico"
134968,0,The product was a little flimsy. It also does not retract well.
109926,1,"I always used blankets on my baby girl until she got old enough to get really squirmy and to pull things into her mouth. I hated ""sleep sacks"" because most of them are too warm and are made of polyester. The Lullabag is great. It's like my baby has a sheet and a light weight (summer) blanket over her. It's perfect. Depending on the temp, she wears a long sleeved onesie, a short sleeved onesie or just her diaper underneath. It zips from the top and the bottom for easy diaper changes while still keeping the rest of her little body warm. Her feet are never cold inside!"
61453,1,I bought this specifically because it DID NOT have the sound and lights feature. It actually makes a lot less fussy noise than my $65 fancy monitor and the sound quality is just as good.
77519,1,"I got this for the new baby that's due in about 3 more months. I put my 15 month in it to try it out and she didn't like it, but then again she never liked swings. I just wanted to see if it would go ok and everything. It worked great and she weighs about 23 pounds. I put it on every setting and they all worked well. The only thing I didn't like, was that the motor was a little loud till the swing really got going. I fixed that by giving it a little push to get it moving faster. The colors are great for our new little girl. We'll be trying for a little boy in another 2 years or so, so I should've gotten a neutral color, but oh well. This will work great while we only have our 3 girls."
58167,1,"We have tried them ALL and this is the only product that does not cause any irritation on our now 2-years old. If we need to use other brands he will have rash in 3 days... (This has happened while travelling and not having Mustela brand around.) And if the wipes seem dry, the package is old, they should not be that way. When it comes to the smell, well, they are just wipes. As long as they do the work I do not care how they smell! We have been using exclusively these wipes for over two years and are really happy with the product."
131947,2,"It is easy to set up, but it would be a more useful product if it could take additional car seats. It is kind of expensive for what you get. The baby doesn't really seem to enjoy staying in the car seat ."
138014,1,"My three-year old nephew has been fascinated with my Homestar Personal Planetarium, but it is an advanced product--not for tiny people or fingers to explore. It occurred to me that I needed to find him his very own, ""touchable"" planetarium that he could learn to care for and use, perhaps enhancing further interest in the night sky and astronomy. Therefore, I was delighted to find this product on Amazon, and after reading the various reviews, I decided that this was the right item to buy. And it was! :) The Twilight Turtle is a unique and happy product--doesn't the world need more of those? With its smooth star-studded shell, soft changeable lights, gentle, sleepy appearance, and its big activation buttons, it has appeal for young children (like my nephew) as well as adults.One of the things I consider when I buy something is the in-box / out of box experience. I found the Twilight Turtle's packaging to be of EXCELLENT, eye-catching quality, and the design makes one feel like he / she has truly purchased a special, lovable item---worthy of showing, keeping, sending, sharing, and gifting. In fact, the box itself is definitely worth keeping for future turtle storage or travel. When one first sees Twilight Turtle in the box, one sees him sitting on a bed of pond rocks under a peaceful starry night. (The toy's sweet expression is one of pleasant repose.) I was most impressed with the notation that the product had been individually hand painted, which offers an intriguing human touch not found in most items today. Immediately, I had a good feeling that the ""Sleep Sheep & Friends: Soothing the Senses for Better Sleep"" products were genuine, finely-crafted, multi-purpose toys that offer both comfort and learning.Removing Twilight from the box was easy--not frustrating as some toys are today with all their many plastic twist ties, and activating Twilight was even easier. :) He came with a clever story to tell, and he was prepared to shine his lights for eager eyes. He wasn't too heavy for a child to hold or too big to overwhelm; his size was just right. The guide booklet's information was fun to read, and it enhanced the creative and educational aspects of the toy. Easy-to-find and easy-to-use buttons make the turtle accessible to various ages and stages. All three light colors seemed pleasing to our eyes--with the amber one being the dimmest / most restful, the blue being in the middle of intensity, and the green / emerald being the brightest. Thus, the user can modify his / her starry night for various ""moods"" of slumber, which is a feature that we liked.Unlike the Homestar Planetarium, Twilight's stars do NOT move, and he has just eight constellations; however, these features were fine for our purposes---a simple, comforting product to encourage a little one to go to his own room for wonder, rest, and sleep.As a night light, Twilight is truly a stellar product--pun intended! :) Champion of the little sleeper, the turtle chases away total darkness, anxiety, stress, and fear; he instills peace, confidence, joy, and curiosity. Though it seems targeted to children, I can see how this same product might also aid adults who need comfort, mood-setting, and sleep-help. (Most especially, for sick, injured, or otherwise, stressed adults!)As an educational toy, the turtle can teach (if adults model important lessons) the following:1. Respect for a nice, personal object / property--no throwing, hitting, or mistreating the turtle2. Gentleness, ownership, and care-taking ( Certificate of Adoption is included with Turtle! )3. Vocabulary: Sensory details, Connections, & Colors--""Twilight"" ""Amber"" ""Blue"" Green"" ""Constellation"" ""Shell"" ""Head"" Legs"" ""Tail"" ""Belly,"" ""Fuzzy,"" ""Smooth,"" ""Hard,"" ""Soft,"" etc.4. Counting: to Seven & Shapes ( Shell Segments ); Counting Stars; Grouping5. Concepts: on / off; big / little; near / far; day / night; 45 minute timer, etc.6. Imagination: Storytelling about Twilight's family and pond adventures; Storytelling related to the constellations; creative storytelling individualized for child7. Beginning mythology and science: Who is Orion? Where do real turtles live?8. Healthy sleep / bedroom habitsOrder Twilight Turtle, and he will transform your rooms and your heart. :)"
175672,1,"This is certainly an easy answer to the swaddle/blanket/warmth dilemma. Our son is a Houdini-Baby who escapes from all swaddles except the Miracle Blanket, but he hasn't gotten out of this yet. It's super easy to use, too. I like that the zipper goes from top to bottom so the tab is away from his chin, and that we'll be able to take the swaddle off and use it as a simple sleep sack once he's outgrown being swaddled."
62182,2,"I bought this pump because the one I had broke. My mom had my baby for the night and I knew she wouldn't be bring her back until later the next day. Unfortunely, it was after 10 pm and where I live there isn't a 24 hour store. So, I had to wait until the next day to buy one and I knew the only place that was going to be open early was Walmart. I went to their website and researched the models that they had and wrote down the three that were rated good. But when I got there, they did not have any of those models. Two of the three that they had had gotten horrible reviews and the other one was the Gerber Massaging Manual Breast Pump. So, after reading the package I decided on buying it. (I didn't really have a choice.) When I used it, it was ok for the first minute or so, but then my milk would get sucked up under the pump part and pushed into the massaging funnel. I thought, ok maybe it wasn't dry enough, I will wash it and try again later. I tried again. Same thing again. I kept thinking that it wasn't dry enough to use yet. I had dried it off before each use. So since I was getting my daughter back quickly I could wait until the next day to pump, again. When I tried the next, same thing again. I called the company and they told me that I was pumping to fast. So, I tried again. This time going slower. It did the same thing again. Turns out the vent wasn't allowing my milk to drain into the bottle. I called the company back and am getting a refund. I only give this product one star for customer service. They were very nice and helpful. Don't buy this product unless you have a lot of time to spend pumping and don't mind some frustration."
160810,1,"I was super stiffly and sick and a stranger told me about Quantum. I'm a big Vit C/Echinacea/Goldenseal person but even those weren't cutting it. I picked up QHP C&F; Formula last night and I am a believer! I have never seen a natural remedy work as well or as fast as this does, I was actually feeling better within 2 hours of my first dose.I will always have this with me and I know that the first ""uh oh, I'm getting sick"" moment will be the last!Amazing"
35472,1,"This is the best baby product out there. Wish I had created it! Not only does it provide a clean surface for your baby to sit on when in shopping carts and high chairs, but it gives them such a SOFT, CUSHY, seat! Great for 6 month-olds who may just be sitting up on their own. You don't have to worry about your baby hitting their head on metal bars. Although it is a bit pricey, I think this Floppy seat is well worth the money--- My daughter loves sitting in it."
73480,1,This is awesome. My husband and I always know when the next feeding or nap should be. It also helps me stay on a consistent pump schedule! I found the best price on amazon.
175735,1,i love halo sleep sacks and was so excited when i realized they had a swaddle sleep sack.. its perfect for newborns since they move and twitch in the middle of the night waking them.. when they are swaddled they are less likely to wake up .. which means less wake ups for mommy.. this would be my number one gift to give to new mommys
121064,2,We got these and almost did not use after a few leeks with them. They do not absorb and do not stay around the baby legs at all.Otherwise are very pretty looking.
55130,2,should have gotten a jogging stroller instead. this thing is huge. i would run into everything. save your money and get a joggind stroller
62399,1,"I bought this for my 12 month old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. She loves looking at the pictures of mommy, daddy, wolfgang (our dog) and her grandparents. It has helped to teach her who is who (especially the grandparents she doesn't get to see too often) and how to say some words. She takes such pride in turning to the page and pointing to whomever we ask her to show us. When we go out she likes to take it with us and show it to people we meet. She loves it and so do we!"
69201,1,"When my daughter was a baby, we would try the samples that came in the mail - and nothing worked like Pampers. They moved with her and held everything in!She is 2 now, and Costco recently stopped carrying Pampers to bring back their brand, Kirkland. I have never had so many leaks with this one box of diapers. It has been awful the past 2 weeks as we finish them off. I have probably wasted more money on washing clothes due to diaper leaks than on what I saved buying the Kirkland brand. I would say she averages 3-4 leaks a week, when I had 1-2 leaks over 2 years with Pampers (and these were from needing to move up to the next bigger size). I also don't like the gel globs that are sometimes left behind either.I love my Pampers and am happy to say there are only 3 dipes left to use before I can switch back. They are well worth the money!"
61710,1,Larger than I expected. Easy to assemble. Very elegant and a perfect accesory to the nursery. Recomended this for a one of a kind gift!
49762,1,I've tried other cabinet locks and found that the cabinet could still easily be pulled open. These locks don't have this problem and work great. I'm ordering a second package to finish the rest of my cabinets.

Very disappointed."

It's in a soft metal container (not a concern, but figured I'd mention).Comment |"
38310,1,I have tried 2 different plastic bathtubs. The first one was sturdy and spacious but it has a bump that was very uncomfortable around my baby's waistline. The other one has a fabric sling on top of the plastic bathtub. It provided good support but my baby felt wobbly. Both bathtubs prove to be unsatisfactory. I use this bath form in my shower cubicle (on the floor) with a long flexible shower head. My baby does not fuss in it as she feels secured. It dries very quickly. Great product with a reasonable price.

61755,1,"This car seat may be on the expensive side, but how can you put a dollar amount on your childs life. I decided to purchase the boulevard after watching a terrible show on side impact collisions. Every parent out there is ""the best driver"" when traveling with their child / children, but our driving is not what we worry about. It other people, and we all know accidents DO happen. SIDE IMPACT PROCTECTION is the first step to preventing a terrible situation from turning deadly. As most of you all know, the leading car seat manufacturers have started to use side impact protection in all types of car seats.Very comfortable!I hope this will help you to make your choice in Car seats weather it is Britax or others...."
165015,1,"Great, soft, secure diapers. My son [..]and I have been using Pampers FLEX for a long time. A few months ago I decided to try a cheaper brand for a change and sure enough, he leaked!!! UGH! Make sure you buy the FLEX DRY -- they are stretchie, soft and seemingly comfy for baby."
160488,2,"This potty seat may work well for a girl, but it's awful for a boy. The pee guard is very low & if my son doesn't sit way to the back of the seat, he ends up peeing over the guard & the urine gets all over the crease between the cushion & the plastic of the seat. It's a mess to clean up & is really unhygenic. It also fits terribly on elongated toilet seats. I replaced it with the Baby Bjorn seat, which works very well & has an adjustable flange on the back to get it to fit the toilet seat. I highly recommend BB seats. No affiliation, just a very happy customer."
10568,0,"Guess what, I used this product as burp cloth rather than cloth diapers because the burp clothes were too expensive. It works well as a burp cloth and it's a lot cheaper than a burp cloth so I would recommend that persons purchase this item."
176868,2,"I have to agree with Mary A's review. For the life of me I can't seem to get this process right. The 4 oz bottles are either too hot or too cold and I have followed the instructions to a &quot;T&quot;. And if the bottle is not warm enough and you try to reheat, you can't turn the system on again for a long, long time. When you have a crying baby in your arms, this just doesn't cut the mustard. I can't tell you how many times I've just resorted to running the bottle under warm water or just feeding the baby a slightly cold bottle (he'll eat anything!). I'm disappointed in this product and I'd recommend you don't waste your money on it."
78711,0,"This is a simple piece of ""T"" shaped strap with (3) metal rings on each end. We used it with the Cosco Alpha Omega Elite car seat and it did work as described, although the car seat is larger than our roll on hand luggage, so it was a bit unstable to sit our 2 year old in it too. However, we fitted it to our large wheeled suitcase and it was fine, very stable and our 4 year old was able to ride. This is just a piece of strap, like you'd find on a rucksack, so $15 seems a bit expensive, but we didn't want to pay out $80 for the proper wheeled carrier. And in the end, it worked great, I was able to pull one large suitcase, one car seat and one 4 year old with one hand! Note, you have to really tighten your car seat straps to attach them securely. I have only given 3 stars, because if you buy this to attach to roll on hand luggage, as described by the manufacturer, you might have problems."
42856,0,"The only thing I'm reviewing is the color of the Indigo moby wrap. I ordered it expecting a sky blue like the photo, but it's more of a denim blue or chambray color. I am REALLY disappointed and plan to return it. It's just so aggravating considering now I have to wait a minimum of 2 more days wrangling an 18 month old and a newborn to get one in hand. Argh!"
73558,0,I reaqlly bought this more for my wife but neither of us found that we used it much after a few days. Seemed like a nice idea at the time. The up side is that it seems pretty well made and is reasonably easy to use.
177875,0,"This mat works just fine, but the opaque, white mats that suction cup have some texture/friction in the material itself so it keeps my kid from slipping around better than this mat did."
53024,1,Realmente este producto si es bueno. Lo recibi como regalo de mi Baby Shower y mi bebe lo uso desde las 2 semanas de nacida. Trate de no acostumbrarla al vibrador para dormir porque eso podria causar un patron que luego seria dificil de romper. Su musica no esta nada mal al contrario no es monotona aunque tengo que reconocer que despues de ya 12 semanas de uso diario de promedio de 45-75 minutos ya es una tonada que se de memoria. La textura de sus materiales es excelente y muy higienica porque al ser clara deja ver que esta ligeramente sucia. A mi hija le gusta quedarse dormida ahi pero por cuestiones de herencia de mala postura decidi dejarla llegar a una etapa de sue&ntilde;o profundo que por lo general es de unos 20 minutos despues de que se queda dormina para asi pasarla a su cunita de forma que no que de en una posicion algo fetal. Sinceramente lo recomiendo. A mi parecer esta entre los primeros lugares en su genero. Una lastima que se tenga que ordenar por internet para que un producto de esta calidad se optenga en Mexico.
57950,1,"I am so in love with this product that I can't praise it enough. If you are bottlefeeding, it's so nice to have the chilled bottles right next to you (especially if your baby is in bed with you like mine were). Such a lifesaver!I totally recommend this product. You won't regret buying it!"
183183,2,"We were contemplating between this one and the arm's reach cosleeper. We went with this because it seemed less 'bulky' but it's got a few major product flaws1. Our bed height is the standard American height (24"") but this one, even in it's lowest setting is quite a bit higher than the American bed heights instead of just 4"" higher. If I had a weird bed height this would be my problem but given that it's ""standard"" height, this is unacceptable.2. Given the design of it's legs, the closest it comes is still one foot away from the bed!You can see both in the image at http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2WYJFPSI8VK4L/B0002X7RYM/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkBoth of them combined significantly elevate the risk of dropping the baby between the beds (imagine it's 3am and you're just getting up because of the crying baby!)We returned this one and bought theArm's Reach Co-Sleeper Original Bassinet, Coco Natural(in white). That one is really good and I highly recommend it that. No gaps anywhere and it still keeps a good 4"" vertical barrier between the beds (safety)."
28043,2,This great for about two seconds. It is a smart idea but poorly executed.
124571,1,These cups keep my little guy busy for a long time! I will say I thought the cups would be a little bigger. They are quite small
35327,1,This shade works great- used it for a Florida vacation and it kept the sun off my six month old entirely. I have a MacClaren Quest. I like the fact that it folds up so easily and fits in the little bag as well. I also like the fact that I can fold up the stroller with the shade attached with no problem. Great product!
154245,1,This is a great wipe if you are interested in something natural. I wish the company made them in bigger packages instead of the small ones.
55360,1,"I like this seat cover. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it would be nice if it were bigger. A lot of people have wrote about it sliding on leather, and we have not had that problem. To me that sounds like a problem with the seat belt not being tight enough, because if the seat belt is locked to where it can't move then bottom line, the carseat shouldn't move. We've only had ours for about a month, so I can't say how durable it will be in the long run, but I can say that when our next baby is born I will be purchasing another one for her carseat."
102580,0,I purchased recently for our son. The top part of the mobile is great with the moving leaves and hanging animals. The only thing that dissapointed me was the light up area with the music. It really does not light up very bright. Overall if you are looking to not spend a fortune this is a good mobile.
70289,0,I like the fact the gate worked for a very wide opening. In fact it was one of the only gates I could find that would go that wide. What I didn't like was the part where the screws broke. We had to use other screws on parts of it because quite a few of them broke. Other than that it has held up very well to two small/ medium dogs. Plus a few active teens.
93375,0,"i got these for my toddler and i'm not that impressed with them. i wish i had read the reviews first, but it was an impulse buy at the store. i have cloth seats and the velcro stuck for a few weeks and is now worthless. it is not a huge problem though, because my son knows that he is not allowed to put his feet under the plastic. but he is still 2 and doesn't always obey. i'm thinking of attaching my own string on the bottom to go around the seat. we'll see how that works out. there are better ones out there that i've seen since my purchase."
153826,1,I love the seventh generation wipes- good density in the wipe and plenty of cleaning fluid to work. Never irritated my son's skin and I feel secure that the wipes are safe for him and the environment. I also was able to get this box of 350 count for around 11 dollars which is a snapping deal. I particularly like that they come in packs of 70 wipes so that the packs can be used without drying out straight from their resealable top.
180562,1,We got this as a gift (actually by accident when someone misread our baby wish list and got this instead of the Sleep Sheep) but it is a really nice plush super soft blanket. The very browny sage green doesn't really go with our nursery but it's great for an extra layer when traveling or for a soft surface to put the little one down on
144607,1,"Hmm, I had to join in with one other reviewer on here and agree that there is nothing wrong with this mobile. If it's put together correctly, it should hang significantly high above the crib mattress..and should not catch while spinning. I have to admit initially the fabric from the 'umbrella' was catching at first..but, just straightened it out and it has been fine. This IS a wind-up mobile...it doesn't state otherwise. This was the only thing that would hold my daughter's attention longer than 3 minutes so it is a shame that it is only wind up...but it does what it was designed to do. I also don't agree that it is cheap - it doesn't seem much different quality than the other wind-ups. The fabric hides most of the components and you aren't suppose to be handling it any more than to wind it up. Definately not as solid as a plastic battery operated mobile..but, honestly most of us got this one b/c it matches the set."
159070,1,"This was purchased to monitor two children sleeping in two different rooms but not for after the parents bedtime. It is being used when the parents want to sit out on the front porch or are in the back yard with friends. It is also used during nap time when the children are up stairs. It is working out great for this.To be honest this was the only multi room monitor that I could find and most online sites that sold it were out of it. There has to be a lot of customers ordering this item.POSITIVES:+ You can hear 2 rooms a once+ The price was reasonable+ Very small, compact receiver+ Sound is clear+ It is very lightweight+ Self-recharging (This is a big plus)NEGATIVES:- Very cheaply made. I suppose if it were studier it may have been too expensive.- There really is no volume control. It is loud or louder.- You can hear background noise which may not always be a negative.- This apparently does interfere with their wireless computer but my son says it is not a problem. They are usually not using the computer when they are using the monitor.My daughter-in-law and son have told me they really enjoy having this."
71523,0,"I've owned the Bugaboo frog for over 3 years now and until I purchased a used Baby Jogger I didn't really have anything to compare it to, so here goes:I received this stroller set as a baby shower gift and it was wonderful for when the baby was young and we took lots of walks around out neighborhood and the mall. It turns wonderfully and we received lots of compliments on it.If you live in the city and tend to walk everywhere, this stroller is for you. Very light and maneuvers small spaces perfectly.If you're like me and live in the suburbs where you have to drive all over the place to get errands done, it will start to grate on your nerves over time from having to assemble/disassemble the stroller every time to go into a store. Folding the frame takes time and I started to notice other moms pulling out their gracos/chicoos/peg peregos in one swoop while I was still trying to open/close my bugaboo frame!Now comes the Baby Jogger Elite that I purchased used on CL. It is so awesome and closes w/one hand in 2 seconds! I LOVE this stroller and now use it much more than my Bugaboo. It is slightly bigger but we are in and out of the stroller in seconds compared to minutes.Overall, Bugaboo was nice to have when my baby was less than a year old and the multi-positions of the Frog was helpful. I'm still not convinced it's worth the money but it does have nice resale value so that's why I gave it 3 stars. Now that my baby is a toddler, the Baby Jogger has won me over by leaps and bounds. I'm pretty sure if we have another baby I will look into the other lines of Baby Jogger since I'm so impressed with my Elite.Happy stroller shopping and enjoy your little one!"
127347,1,"Order this crib on a Sunday and it arrived at on 3 days later (actually right when we pulled back into the driveway!). Love that it had free shipping through this site and it never mentioned having the mattress or conversion kit included so I have no idea what the man below is talking about.It was very easy to assemble, multiple times in our case since we did it backwards and it looks amazing and very sturdy! All of our friends and family have commented on how nice it looks. I expect for it to scratch a little while we were putting it together but that did not happen and we even dropped a couple of pieces again the finish. Our son is not expected for another couple of months but I am sure he will love it!"
39841,2,Very poor sound quality. Very artificial sounds. Volume does not go very loud.
81445,0,"This stroller is convenient because the car seat attaches right on the child's tray, so for your younger infant there is no need to take the baby in and out of the car seat. It also has plenty of space for drinks, snacks, cell phone, or keys. However, I am now looking for a better stroller. This one does not steer well. It is difficult to steer with two hands, and you can forget trying to talk on your cell phone or sip coffee while maneuvering this stroller. The front wheels always seem to be jamming up. The seat with only 2-position recline is not adequate. The harness is made of thin straps that my toddler has discovered how to wriggle almost completely out of. After 21 months of light use this stroller is ready for the trash. We have basically used it for mall shopping, and it's a good thing because I can't imagine trying to steer it on a rough surface. The canopy has ripped along one side and is separating from the body of the stroller. I bought this one because it had lots of coordinating pieces, and I thought I was getting a real bargain at the price. But now I have to purchase another more expensive stroller since this one didn't hold up."
89925,1,"I have three children in diapers. My oldest is 4 years old and is autistic. We have not been able to potty train him yet.We tried several brands only to find out that Pampers Baby Dry was always the one we went back to. No question! No leaks! But the cost of our diapers just adds up. Amazon has the absolute cheapest price I have found - in stores or on-line. And free shipping, and I got (...) off with a promotion for baby items over (...) prurchased. I made out! And never had to leave my door! Thanks Amazon! Really!"
173107,2,"I bought this after my second child was born to protect our car's seats from the child seat. I have the original thin Prince Lionheart from my first child and love it. This one is so bulky with the built in lip that it got in the way of anyone having to sit next to it in the car. Also, the two part design causes so many problems as it constantly comes undone causing the top portion to slip down (thus defeating the purpose of protecting the seat).It does catch spills, but the original thin seat saver does too and actually does a better job. I have just recently moved the original one under my younger child and discarded this one altogether. I will look for something else to put under my older child's seat.I do not recommend this product."
169877,0,"I haven't had the same malfunctions as the other reviewers but true, the wood on the inside isn't high quality. I guess I didn't expect solid cherry for $250. I've been pleased with the product other than 3 issues you might consider...1) The rails at the sides are square. My son is quick to pivot and has hit his head on these several times. Rounded rails, such as the front and back would have been nicer.2) The dark stain is easily damaged. A belt buckle to the front rail or a curious baby's teeth will quickly leave marks.3) I wasn't fond of the flimsy pad that was included. I upgraded to a contoured pad in the standard dimensions. Unfortunately this dresser appears to have larger dimensions and the pad has roughly a 1"" gap around each side."
183439,1,I love this diaper bag! I just happened to see it when we registered and I loved it! Got it for a gift at one of our showers and since our son was born I have used it everyday! He is 15 months now and I am still loving it! It is a great color that hides all of the dirt... this bag still looks brand new! I have purchased it as a gift for two friends since and they love it as well! I highly recommend this bag! Very sturdy and holds up great!
142133,1,"We originally bought the less expensive Snuggly. It did not take us long to buck up and buy the more expensive Baby Bjorn. It has been worth every penny. I just bought one for my sister who is expecting her first. The thicker straps have made it much easier to organize as I take it on and off. It is also very easy to adjust which is important as my wife is very petite so when I use it after her, I have to re-adjust all the straps.My wife and I toted our son all over Italy with this product. My son is now 25 pounds (which I think is the weight limitation) and I still use it when I am working around the house. When my son gets fussy and wants attention, I put him in this while I am working around the house. He immediately quiets down as he watches everything that I do.As a testament to this product, I have purchased several others as baby shower gifts for friends and family"
21051,0,"I've had this stroller for a few years and I do love that it's light weight and easy to transport in and out of the car. The visor does not block the sun, which is unfortunate because in order to really use this for outdoor use, you have to purchase something like a kiddopotomous sun visor. I am currently having a problem with the frame of my stroller, not uncommon for a stroller that travels on airplanes. I am experiencing the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. It's been going on for 3 weeks and still no resolution which is probably because I can't get anyone to return my phone calls. You leave a message with a representative and seriously no one calls you back. Today, I talked to the RUDEST representative who last week yelled at me and this week hung up on me. I was frustrated but by no means was I yelling or being rude. Even if I was.. it is bewildering to me that someone from customer service could hung up on a customer. For this unbelievable experience, I would NOT recommend this product. I would rather pay the $$ for a stroller that has a reputable customer service."
179695,2,"I have no idea how this product received so many good reviews. The wheels kept popping off for no reason while at the airport, or when taking the car seat off. Such a huge pain. Would not purchase again."
114666,1,"We have gotten lots of use out of our Fisher Price booster seat. We purchased this about 3 years ago and used it every day for our son. We now use it for our daughter. The adjustable height makes it fit any table, or you can use the very convenient dishwasher safe tray. I love how easy it is to strap onto any chair - the adjustable velcro straps make it a snap. The seat is also easy to wipe clean.The booster folds nicely to make it easily transportable. We take this with us on vacation a few times a year to make meal-time more enjoyable for everyone. It doesn't take up much room once folded and the velcro strap makes for a nice carry handle when your hands are full with all the other kidstuff that gets lugged on vacation.Definitely recommend as an every-day seat or as a travel seat to take to grandma's, etc."
42476,0,"I ordered this & I like it except for the fact that it is VERY hot during the summer months. I am a hot natured person & when I put this on sweat runs down my back & my baby is sweating when I take her out. The fabric is very thick & it wraps around you several times with the fabric doubled. Other than this problem I like it. My baby falls right to sleep in it, it is comfortable otherwise. I did have to practice a couple times putting it on to get the right fit. Maybe I will be able to wear this during fall/winter, but definately not now. I have ordered the maya wrap so we will see if that is any better."
28149,0,"These are great organizers for a good price that can fit on many different size closet rails. I was disappointed that they included stickers that went through toddler sizes, but not enough dividers to use all of the stickers. I will be ordering an additional set."
121628,1,"I love this! My son is nearly 3 years old and due to a disability cannot walk, all prams and strollers were just not strong enough to have continuous use for him but this is strong and comfortable for him. Also the easiest fold up/fold out I have ever had. only one problem I think and thats the way the brake is on the wheels, it means its impossible to bump the pram up some steps and rather difficult to bump down any.. also the brake is stiff once applied so taking it off is sore on the foot if you don't have really tough shoes on. Other than the brake situation its a great pram!"
68431,0,"I've been with my boyfriend a long time and recently he moved a few hours away, so we are currently in a long distance relationship. Like most men these days, he's been brainwashed by culture and the media that all women are supposed to be 100% smooth and naturlly hair free except for head eyebrows and eye lashes. And- like a lot of guys, he made me feel self conscious about my dark hair. we used to see eachother a lot and I was pretty much shaving everyday...you name it...and i probably shaved it. Since he went away i've been lazy and not shaving anymore, but since my hair is growing out i thought i'd take the opportunity to remove the hair with a new method that might make it come back slower. I discovered this product and when i read that it made hair NEVER COME BACK i naturally HAD to try it. I was so excited i tried it right away. I read some review that said it hurt, but i've tried waxing and plucking hairs and i'm pretty good at dealing with the pain so i thought what the hell i'm sure i can deal. It said it created a slight tingling sensation...aka BURNING PAIN. The directions said the average setting was 4 (it goes to 10) and that you should apply it on each hair for 15 seconds. I had it set on 1 and i tried it on a hair and couldn't even leave it in for 5 seconds it burned so bad. i can't even imagine the people who set it to 10! they must be either crazy or desensitized. i kept trying to give it a chance over and over but it was so painful. i tried to set it on 2 and started swearing. The package says to keep the tweezers on hand to pull out the dead hair when you're done so you don't have to look away and loose your spot. Let me tell you...you don't even have to worry about loosing your spot...the area is so red and the pore is bubbling with white puss looking stuff that..trust me you WON'T loose your spot. The only thing that this product made me realize is how ridiculous it is- the pain we go through to look good and the pressure us women (and men) are put under for having hair on our bodies that is completely natural and harming no one! i have read that the product does infact remove hair forever, this was my first time using it so i can't say that for sure yet. so, if you want to go through that and your hair is gone forever...more power to you and good luck...i hope you don't pass out from the pain. i read a review about a man who didnt believe his wife about the pain so he tried it...he was in the marines and said it hurt like hell. I was skeptical but now i believe him. If you want electrolysis i recomend you have a few stiff drinks and then go get it professionaly done."
103609,0,"I don't really see the benefit of these. I didn't really find them more comfortable, and like another reviewer, I had high hopes that these would get me more milk, since they supposedly have a 'massaging' action. Not so, at least for me. There wasn't anything wrong with them; I just don't see the point. If you want to get more milk, try the next size up of the regular shield, the one for large nipples, even if you don't think your nipples are large: they'll pull more breast tissue into the cylinder. Worth a try."

105595,0,"I had the Diaper Genie for my first baby and liked it, but when my 2nd baby was on the way I decided to try the Diaper Champ because I could use regular trash bags in it instead of the special refills you had to purchase for the Diaper Genie. I like that it is easier to use and is easy to change the trash bag when it is full. I am not happy with the odor protection though. With the Diaper Genie I never even noticed an odor in the baby's room. With this new Diaper Champ once I put a poopy diaper in it I can smell it whenever I walk into the room. So I am not happy with that part of it, but otherwise it is very simple to use."

134881,2,"I'm frustrated enough with this car seat to take the time to write a review. We carefully researched travel systems for their safety and convenience and chose the Graco Snugride Carseat in Colby and the matching MetroLite Stroller. The stroller is wonderful - lightweight and easy to handle - and we will probably enjoy it once our baby is out of the infant car seat. The car seat has two problems that continue to annoy us. First, the handle on the car seat gets stuck and is extremely difficult to adjust. Second, when our baby (now 3 1/2 months) is in the car seat, the angle is such that his head lolls forward when he is sleeping. I thought that the angle of the back seat in our car might be the problem, but this happens when the car seat is in the stroller as well. If I could do it over again, I would choose a different car seat, even if it meant forfeiting the economy of a full travel system."
134949,1,My son only likes this brand of pacifiers and they are great! Too bad the shipment process put a red color while I liked the blue ones.
138576,1,"I bought this for my 12 month old. However, my older boys (ages 9yrs and 3 yrs) ended up ""borrowing"" it! Needless to say, I'll be buying another one soon!"
82819,1,"My 3 month old stops fussing immediately when we turn this on. I only wish it was a bit smaller as it seems bulky when I am carrying her in her carseat. We keep it there. I hope I don't confuse her later though. When kids in her preschool begin answering the question ""..and what sound does a sheep make?.."" She'll answer with loud whale sounds. Ha ha. No, but she loves the whale sounds. I like that you can take out the sound machine and let the baby play with the lamb."
152511,0,"This product is a good value when compared to other stroller covers. It is nice and warm, and even my busy 18-mo-old doesn't mind being bundled up in it. However, the zippers do get stuck a lot. I had the same problem with the zippers on the infant bundle me, but it didn't stop me from purchasing the toddler version because I didn't want to spend twice as much."
124688,1,"I am pleased with the performance of the gate that I recently purchased. It spanned the gap very well for us as we had just moved into an upper apartment. I have a one year daughter; she is not able to push this thing around at all.The only thing I felt that was not taken into consideration was the fact that if you have a large baseboard lining your floor, the gate will actually end up having to be elevated from the floor, regardless it still work phenomenally."
156277,2,"I usually don't buy products when they first com out, but i thought this one was a great product. My three month old, like most other babies, has quite a few skinfold on her little neck, where moisture collects, and irrates the skin. I usually use regular powder, but am always worried about that, since i've heard it being harmful when inhaled. So, as soon as i saw this liquid powder i've bought two bottles. The first time i used in on my three month olds neck, she seemed very irritated and cried a lot. i've washed it off and she stopped crying. i thought it was a fluke. I used thi powder three more times over two weeks and every time she cried until i washed her neck. so, if you decide to use this on your child, watch closely for signs of irritation."
88938,1,"Granted, the pampers baby-dry diapers are more expensive than most brands but there is a reason; they hardly every leak. I have struggled with a few brands in the past but these are easy, and you dont find yourself having to change your baby's clothes 3 times a day."
128704,1,"This is quite ingenious! I don't know if any other manufacturers have them, but they are such a great idea. Instead of a hole there is a slot in the top. Around the side are the marks I,II and III. You line up the marks with the baby's nose and that dictates how fast the flow of milk is. This teat allows a thicker liquid to flow through so you can add rice or another cereal of your choice if you need to. My baby is in the 90th percentile and at 8 weeks old Milk just wasn't enough. I put 1 tablespoon of rice in with 4 ounces of milk initially and then later on increased that to 2 tablespoons (all with doctor's approval). It is a much thicker liquid but flowed through this teat easily. I highly recommend these."
85069,1,"I bought this for my 6 month old as his first blankee and it has been a huge hit! The very first time he grabbed he, he snuggled up with it and went to sleep..HE LOVES IT. And so do I! Its so soft and the perfect size. I definitely recommend this and will be buying the bigger one for him down the road. The price is high, but its definitely worth it!"
161460,2,"I don't know but DH and I both tried to ""push hard"" on the middle of the tub where it says and it still leaks. My baby's 1st bath it leaked all over my counter. I had to put it in the big bath tub and put water in the bottom of that so it didn't leak when we bathed him. HUGE inconvienience. This tub will be returned to babysrus ASAP. We went out and bought the Ocean Wonders one instead and LOVE it."
69569,0,"These diapers have pros and cons for me. I like that the minis are small enough for a newborn, but the Fuzzibunz XS work much better as a small pocket diaper.I have been using the Minis (size xs) on my son - he is about 8lbs. The biggest con, is they leak! No matter how we fold the inserts and if we pad extra in the back or front we have leaks - I think it is because the elastics around the leg are not tight enough. When using the xsmall or minis, I really recommend snapping them up almost too tight to contain fluids. I definitely do not recommend using these at night or after a big feeding.The pros are I do like that they are easy to use and the velcro is very sturdy - they launder well and the colors are great. Also, they are made in the USA which is a big plus for me. I think they will work a little better when my son is larger. I am not totally ready to give up on them (since I made the investment), but there are far better pocket diapers out there!"
149761,1,Got this as a back up seat for when the grandson travels in our car. Great seat- really keeps him in place and is comfortable. Top level product.
58623,1,"This was given to us as a shower gift. It is a great product ,very easy and practical. We use it to sterilize bottles,pacifiers,my brest pump parts.. it only takes 4 minutes and its done. My mom thought it was great,she said when my siblings and I were born boiling on the stove was the only option and she wished they had stuff like this then."
73718,0,"1. Feed Indicator: I really really wanted this after the birth of my son so I could remember when the last time I fed him was. When I remembered to have it next to me it was great to be able to push the bottle button when I would start to nurse him and then I would have something to reference later. After his birth, my brain was malfunctioning a lot and I was nursing him every two hours and this helped. Besides that, I did not find any other use for it.2. Diaper Indicator: Who cares when you last changed your baby's diaper? If it is wet or soiled, change it. His diapers had a little yellow line on the front that would turn blue when wet. Easy. Change the baby.3. Nap Indicator: Infants don't have napping schedules, they sleep when they sleep, so this function was useless to me. Now, that my son is 4 months old, I may have a use for this function, but by now none of the other buttons are of any use to me.4. Whatever You Want Indicator: I didn't use this for anything.Often I would sit down to nurse and realize that I left the Itzbeen in the living room and end up not pushing the button. Eventually, I just stopped using it all together and resorted to having a scrap of paper and a pen in all my nursing locations. With all this said, I don't blame you if you think it is cool and want it anyway."
34958,2,I really hate this car seat. It takes up way too much room. The only place we could fit it rear-facing and securely was behind the passenger seat. To do so we had to shove the passenger seat all the way forward so that means there is no room any longer for a front passenger. And even then the seat isn't reclined as much as the indicator says it should be (almost but not quite). I would have never purchased this seat. My mother bought it without consulting me and I used it because I'm broke. I have an incredibly small car and this is the worst seat for it. If I had an Escalade maybe there would be room. This thing is HUGE. Besides that it's difficult to get the baby in and out and adjust the straps. There is just nothing good about this thing.
47891,1,"I needed a gate to keep my 55 pound bulldog out of certain rooms of the house. I tried it hardware mounted, but she dislodged it from the wall. When I pressure mount it, she can not budge it. Plus, it is very easy to adjust if I need to move her to another room in the house. Now that I am pregnant, I will definitely purchase this product for other areas of the house. The reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the damage my dog caused when it was hardware mounted. However, I doubt a small child go do the same damage."
16533,0,"I bought them for $5.00 at the baby sale about a year ago and that was fine, but this new price is insane."

163352,1,"Sturdy, compact, convenient, easy-to-clean, nice neutral colors, nice big tray. Great item all around!"
32940,2,"These sippy cups have far too many pieces to keep up with. It takes forever to put them together after each wash. Plus they are not completely leak proof, as others have mentioned. You have to pay close attention when you screw the lid on or all of the liquid will dump out upon the first sip. As a mother of 3 boys and one more on the way, when you have a kid screaming for a drink you want something simple to give him. These cups are NOT it."
173356,1,"This swing is a lifesaver!!! My daughter is 9 weeks old and loves to sit in her swing and look up at herself in the mirror she even gets excited and coos at the butterflies and birdie moving above her. She loves this swing so much she'll keep herself entertained in it while I get housework done and once she's had enough playing it rocks her to sleep and she sleeps so well in it that she'll nap for a couple hours at a time...I'm not sure exactly how long she will sleep in it because she sleeps so long in it I always have to take her out and wake her up to feed her otherwise she would probably sleep right through a feeding and be super hungry when she woke up. The music it plays is nice and I don't get tired of listening to it. It also has good battery life, my daughter plays in her swing alot and we always have the music and mobile going and we just now had to change the batteries at 2 months I'd say that's pretty good. The swing was too fast for her during her first month because she's a small baby she was only 6 pounds 14 ounces but all we had to do was drape a blanket over the swing so it lightly touched the floor and that slowed it down to the perfect speed but now that she's 9 pounds we don't have to use the blanket anymore and its still the right speed for her. This swing is definately worth the money and it looks really nice and matches with our furniture so we can keep it out unlike the other swings fisher price makes which wouldn't match anything and would probably end up in a closet when it wasn't being used."
156415,1,"My son is tall for 2 and this is still large on him, he'll get a lot of use out of it. I'm happy that over his footed fleece pajamas it adds another coat of warmth so we don't have to turn the heater too high to kind of balance the winter weather. This is great until your child can learn to use a blanket... mine just plays peekaboo with it!"
11533,1,I can't wait to surprise my son with this Bowling Pin Bank @ his bowling party. The guests will have enough room to sign their names and my son can also store his money in it. And this company shipped super fast. Received it within days of placing the order. Thank You!!!
150352,1,"The changing pad cover is soft and fits the changing pad perfectly. It is not waterproof, but the changing pad is so it does not matter."
156144,1,"At first when my daughter was 2mths, she didn't like being in it more than five minutes, and now she just loves it. She loves to grab the animals and make them light up and talk. She'll sit there for hours."
138260,1,My daughter had been fighting bedtime because she was afraid of the dark even with a conventional night light. We go the lady bug; placed it in the center of the room on a clothes hamper to give it some height and it projects wonderfully on the ceiling. Green works the best but she likes all the colors. Bedtime is much easier now.
171681,1,I received this tub as a shower gift. I did not use the tub in the sink but I did try it. It fits very securly in our double sink. I used the sling only a couple of times. Our daughter started throwing her leg over the edge. The foam cushion did not seem to help her from sliding. She enjoys turning her head and looking around while bathing. I keep one hand on her while she is in the tub. She does not like the bump in the bottom and tries to move over it. I am glad it is there because it helps to keep her from sliding. We use this tub everynight.
136799,1,"It is a good bumper, well finish and good fabric. I have been using it for a month with my toddler and has worked fine."
122527,1,"You cannot buy more stars for the money, but the manufacturer needs to put more adhesive in the package. The stars are easy to put up and work well, but you'll likely use up all the adhesive putty well before you get them all up. Overall a solid option for safely and easily putting up stars in your child's room."
86739,1,"I originally bought this so I didn't have to keep bending down to get the diaper bag out of the basket in the bottom of the stroller, but the diaper bag was too long to fit on the mommy hook without rubbing the wheels. But it's perfect for going shopping or walking around. The grocery bags fit good. Love it!"
159541,0,"Our baby girl liked sitting in this, BUT she easily ended up head down (hanging over the side). My friend also has a baby the same age as my daughter and he also ended up hanging upside-down over the edge. Our son had a different Fisher-Price bouncer 5 years ago and this never happened. The main difference that I notice is that the sides on this one are much more shallow (because of the 'aquarium' attachment). I did contact Fisher-Price about this issue and they were more than willing to issue a refund (they sent a shipping lable and I sent it back to them).Perhaps the latest styles are deeper (at least I hope so). Just be careful !!"
135769,2,I tried these bottles for my 1 month old daughter because they are supossed to help with gas. We tried both the long neck bottles and the fat bottles and both were terrible. She had worse gas than with the Avent bottles and the nipples are two soft. We have switched back to the Avent bottles that we used with my older daughter and she seems to be much more happy. Don't buy these bottles.
110031,1,We have been using this mattress for six months now and I haven't had any problems with it. It wipes cleanly and our baby has been sleeping soundly on it every night. I also like the fact that it will serve as a toddler bed mattress when my baby grows out of the crib.
95790,1,"These bottles are a MUST HAVE for your baby. Less spit up, less belly aches, and you'll never go back to those other brands."
115857,2,"My son is 18 months old and well within the weight limits for the stroller. However, we have to struggle a lot each time to buckle him in. Main reason is that the crotch strap is very short, making it very tight to put in. There is no way to extend that strap and I don't think I will be able to use this stroller for long.What a shame that a product, which otherwise is well made, has such a basic design flaw."
28008,1,"You'll need to take off the white safety stoppers, but then it works great on carpet. My son even takes it over rugs. Safety shouldn't be an issue if you install baby gates and properly supervise your kid. It works for bigger babies, too. My 8 mo. old weighs 25 lbs. and he's got a little extra room in the seat. People have complaints about the entertainment tray, but I think that's a secondary issue. My baby likes the little stuffed animals on the tray, but is more interested in getting around and exploring his surroundings."
131130,2,"These pads were a deal that was too good to be true. Compared to other pads they were a good deal for 3. After using them for less than 7 weeks, they are already falling apart. Balled up on 1st wash. Plastic inside ripped on 1. Only washed a couple times a week!! If you hand wash and hang to dry they might be okay. Would NOT buy again. Ordering more of the expensive ""name brand"" pads!!!"
119505,2,I had the same problem that one of the other people had. It (the music)turnes on and off when my baby cries and it's not voice activated. I just bought it today and I guess I will be returning it tomorrow. Maybe the next one will work right. I will be exchanging for the same product. The rest of the features are great! As long as you don't have the same problem I've had - this is the perfect monitor.I'm giving this a second review! I returned the first monitor for another one and it too didn't work. I gave up on it and I'll be doing some research on getting another. I did notice more static on the second monitor. This I guess is just a poor product. Usually I am very faitful to Fisher Price. I guess they can't always have the best.

72356,0,"Bought these rails to convert my sons 3-in-1 bed to a full size bed. I had concerns at first because these rails only have two screws per end to attach to the frame and no underneath middle supports; however, after trying it out with a full-size boxspring and pretty thick mattress it does well. -no jumping on the bed though!! As long as the boxspring fits the frame exactly it will work well for a couple years but will not hold the weight as he gets bigger or I would say 50-75 lbs max, although my mother-in-law used it for about a week with no problems-i would reccommend just watching it."
80151,2,"This CD is so poor......with one exception.I hadn't heard of the most of the artists on this tribute album before....and I quickly came to realize why this was the case. Elevator music.The reason I had bought the CD was to hear Mary Chapin Carpenter's rendition of 'Grow Old With Me'. WOW. This is the version for my wedding. Hauntingly beautiful. I had always admired her music and this only enhanced my thoughts on her vocal abilities.It is an expensive purchase for one song....but if you want this cover version, well......save your cents. :0)"
147773,1,"I received this car seat as a gift, along with the stroller. I have a 6 month old daughter who pretty much does not have a problem with this car seat. We found that she did sweat alot from the fabric, which did make her cry. We used a cloth diaper between her and the seat, and haven't had a problem since (this is not recommended by the manufacturer, however). She is tall for her age, and also thin, but we haven't had a problem with the way she sits in the seat. As for the shopping cart dilemma (which is also not recommended by the shopping cart manufacturers), the seat fits fine in-between the two bars. You just can't click it onto the bars. The straps are not a problem, we just push the button to loosen them before we buckle or un-buckle her. The plastic safety buckle fits snugly on her chest (where it should fit), and is easy to buckle and un-buckle."
181633,1,"I bought this diaber bag about 5 months ago, and it has held up great. It is small....but that's why I bought it. I have plenty of room for extra diapers, wipes, a change of clothes, my stuff, and a bottle. I love the fabric and color, it still looks new."

174246,1,"I was recently on a trip to China and took these teeny towels with me for sanitation purposes. The little chain easily looped around my backpack, the towels remainied moist for the entire 4 weeks.

Suddenly, he started crying all the time. HE had constant gas! My mother said he was probably allergic to milk so we switched him to soy formula. However, when we finally went to the doctor he told us that the baby probably wasn't allergic to milk (because it is EXTREMELY RARE). HE said it was because of the avent bottles. He recommended the regular old-fashioned Gerber bottle and nipples. We switched that day and have never had any more problems. My son is eight months old now and has not had a stomach ache or gas pains since he was 8 weeks old. And to think we missed out on two months worht of sleep because of a bottle!"
169010,0,"pros: comfortable, easy to change, no leaking, soft.cons: no wet indicator, have to buy sensitive series."
78496,2,It took me forever to get this product but when I got it it did the job. The suction power is good and it does the job well. I am overall happy with the product but I did not use it as much as I thought I would.
12939,1,"Unobtrustive, non-plasticky safety gate, well made in Mexico, delivered from Pennsylvania. The price of the product was right; with shipping still less expensive than any other gate on the internet. Used similar items years ago as safety gates for toddlers - these were purchased to corral a puppy. Good fit for varying size door openings; doesn't mark or require permanent installation; easy to operate; when fitted in place, solid and immovable. Exactly what was required."
47625,1,My daughters have very sensitive skin. Atopic dermatitis and various allergies run in the family. I have used Mustela products for more than 4 years now and have been happy with the results. I believe my daughters' bouts of eczema and other rashes have been minimized because of Mustela. My sister is pregnant and plans to use the Mustela line. It smells divine and the scent lingers even after the children run around!
56867,1,"This gate has worked great for us! When our little guy started crawling we determined that we needed a gate for the bathroom, because the litter box for the the cat is there. Every time I turned around that's where the little guy was headed. So we did some research and found this gate. It is easy to open with one hand, it swings closed or locks open, it doesn't pinch little fingers and is strong enough to withstand pushing from the little guy. We are so glad to have it!"
66842,1,great product would recommend to all expectant or current mothers the bottles and shields seem to be very well made and we love the purchase
116061,2,"This towel was soft at first, then got scratchy after multiple washings. My baby didn't seemed to mind it, but I got a different towel for her. The washcloths stayed soft, though."
120947,1,We just got a puppy and needed a gate to separate the kitchen from the living room. My husband installed it and it took 15 minutes. It also doesn't require drilling in your wall and the door is easy to open/close but feels secure enough that the puppy can't get through. It was also wide enough that it should fit most openings. We like it so much we are buying a second one to put in another area of the house.
172557,2,This product was terrible. The spray never worked and my son slide down the mesh slide htat came with it. I got ride of after 1 month. I do not recommend it. It is a waster of money or gift.
62909,1,"I LOVE THIS ITEM!!! MY SON IS 5 MONTHS NOW, AND I JUST GOT THIS FOR MYSELF ABOUT A MONTH AGO. I WISH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT SOONER! IT'S NICE! THERE IS NO SMELL, AND ACTUALLY WHAT I DO IS PUT A DRYER FABRIC SOFTNER SHEET IN THE BOTTOM WHEN I CHANGE THE BAG TO MAKE IT SMELL GOOD! ;) SO EASY TO CHANGE AND DUMP! RECOMMENDED FOR ANY NURSERY!"
113940,1,"My house is really modern and I was looking at 2oo dollars high chairs for my baby girl, well I came across this booster chair and red the reviews, I liked the look because it kind of blends in with my furniture and I liked the red, for 28 dollars I thought it was worth it give it a try.Bought it and never looked again for a high chair! I saved to myself almost 200 dollars and space in the house. It adjust to any chair and it's easy to carry around, we also took it to restaurants and friends houses with us!!!it's easy to clean the tray fits in the dishwasher...what else can I say...two thumbs up!!!"
181639,2,"We received this item as part of our baby registry. Within a few weeks, it begin to rip (the lining inside). Baby Boom (the manufacturer) agreed to send a new one. After a couple of mail attempts we finally received it (SEVERAL weeks later). The first day of use, the lining already started to rip. Did I mention the inside zipper came broken as well? When we called about the 1st bag, they said if the replacement also had flaws, they would upgrade our bag. We haven't called yet, so we'll see.In addition to the above flaws mentioned, it is extremly small. It looks large in the store, but when you start putting basic baby items in it, it fills up fast. It doesn't open very wide.I don't recommend the bag at all. More hassle than it is worth. As far as the manufacturer goes...even though we got a new bag, they were slow in returning messages and in delivery. In general, I suggest staying away from Eddie Bauer bags."
158972,1,"I have 4 complete sets of Emily Green dinnerware -- bowl, plate, cup, and place mat -- in Sunshine Safari, Mix It Up, Up Above the World, and Dump It. For the past couple of years, they've been my favorite dinnerware for my 3.5-year-old, and I can't wait for my 15-month-old to get big enough to use them too! The artwork is quirky and adorable, but not too cutesy -- my family loves the designs. The dinnerware is also a big hit with my son's little buddies whenever they are over.The plates are very generously sized for a kid (regular dinner plate), so they have plenty of room for different kinds of food (even for the kids that don't like their foods to touch). You can fit a personal pizza or have plenty of room to lay out ingredients for do-it-yourself type meals. They are slim but sturdy, and the designs of each set are most vibrant on the plates (other than on the place mats). The plates might be a little big for smaller children or those with little appetites, but they'll grow into them. Also, keep in mind that the plates may be too big for high chair trays (they don't fit on our Fisher Price Rainforest high chair or our Geuther wooden high chair), and they are not microwave-safe (which hasn't bothered us at all).Amazon had these for the best price, and they definitely are worth the investment so far. Our oldest set is over 2 years old and the color is just as beautiful as our newest set. My only fear is that Emily Green will continue to come out with more fantastic designs and I will have to keep adding to our collection (much to my husband's chagrin!)."
66670,1,"This is the best stroller I have ever had...and I've had five others. I don't jog, but I walk alot."
60651,2,"They make it sound so easy...open the lid, push the bag down, throw the diaper in, close the lid, and turn the crank. I had to open the lid, remove the lip, push the bag down (otherwise the bag would rip), throw the diaper in, put the lip back on, twist the lip (the top handle wouldn't twist the bag), and then close the cover. After only a month, the lip had worn so much that I couldn't even put it back on. I had to empty this thing every 2 to 3 days. I finally decided to throw the thing out and buy a better diapering system and I am very happy with the Safety 1st Neat System. I would never recommend the diaper genie to anyone!"
36752,1,"I purchased this for my wife who does not have a tailbone. ""Donut"" rings which are inflatable have never been adequate(the opening is usually too small or the rubber or plastic ring deflates over time). By sitting or lying on the Boppy, she enjoys the comfort and support she has never had in the past. She is thrilled."
36976,1,"We bought this booster seat when my 22 month old daugther became too tall for her convertible seat and she absolutely loves it. I don't know what some of these people are complaining about. We've had no problems with the straps twisting. As with any straps you have to make sure they're straight every time you put them on. And the fact that they are not as stiff as some other straps make them much more comfortable for the child. The puzzle latch is a little more complicated than some others, but as long as you clip it in before you snap the chest clip it works easily. We've had no difficulty loosening or tightening the straps. You don't have to rethread the straps to raise the height of the harness which is a definite plus. My daughter is tall for her age and the top adjustment for the harness is higher than many others. And the padding is good. We looked at some seats where there was absolutely no padding in the lower back and hardly anything in the seat. But the greatest safety feature is that the shoulder belt guides are attached to the plastic frame and not to the seat cover. All in all, it's a great seat. We even bought a second one to put in my husband's truck."
136415,1,"Where do you find a changing pad to fit this? All I can find is 32"" long and I need one about 29 3/4"" long. Babies R Us doesn't even carry that size."
100589,1,it keeps my baby dry for horus and the product was delivered in 2 days
17208,0,It's a good monitor but I have to move the antenna a lot so it doesn't get any static.
76417,2,"My husband insisted on registering for this - so we did. We rec'd as a gift and truthfully, I took it out of the box, washed it in Dreft so that it would be ready to use when I brought my son home from the hospital. My doc said not to use it and so I didn't - ever... However, I have also been blessed with a very healthy baby that hasn't had a cold to date - he is 7 1/2 months old now and too old to use it since he has been rolling over now for 2 months. I say... Save your money and get something you can use!"
22946,1,This was perfect for my son. Most boxes are a bit girly and this was nice and simple. I bit larger than I expected but it works just great.
133387,2,"I registered for these bottles because everyone raves about them however I too, found that the nipples collapse AND I have had so much leakage around the white ring that holds the nipple in place while feeding my son. I thing they are highly overrated and expensive when there are so many other less expensive BPA free bottles on the market now."
13566,1,The product was easy to use. My child was unable to remove because the product fit the rails snugly. Saved my crib from teething marks.
18640,2,"I purchased the Cozy Cruizer second-hand at a yard sale. Considering that the price we paid was only 1/8th the cost of one new, we couldn't resist. Not good! We haven't had much difficulty in attaching it to our adult bikes; our problem was with the wheels. The plastic rims do not last and can very easily warp, making seating the tire pointless since it will very quickly pop off once you start inflating.In hindsight, we should have purchased a bike trailer with real bike wheels (ie. metal rims and spokes). I would have thought that buying a Little Tikes product would have resulted in quality-especially for the price!"
145782,1,"My 4 month old LOVES this jumper. He loves to stand up, look around, and bounce and this allows him to do all things safely! I started him in it at 3.5 b/c his head and neck were ready. One thing I really like is how far down he sits in the seat. This allows the jumperoo to support his upper body that he doesn't have a lot of control over yet which is an improvement over some of the other chairs that we have. (We have a walker that we put him in and the first thing he did was take a nose dive into one of the toys. Needless to say, we're waiting to try that one again.) He loves to jump and play in it for 30 minutes at a time. (Great for Mom time, cooking dinner, or trying to get stuff done.) At first he could barely touch the floor so I put a book under it. I like how you can adjust the height so I can control how much he's able to bounce himself around. If your baby loves to stand and bounce, this jumperoo is for you!"
108151,1,"I stay home with my baby, so I don't need to pump huge amounts of milk. The pump is easy to assemble and to clean. It is very simple to use. After a little practise, it is easy to pump as much milk as you need in a short amount of time. It takes about the same amount of time for me to pump as it does to breastfeed. Of course, you have to add on top of that the time to wash, sterilize and assemble the pieces. The only failing is with the instruction booklet. I wish it were a little clearer about the assembly and had more tips for use. As a first time mom, I didn't have a lot of confidence in my early attempts, and I wish the instructions gave some idea of what I could expect the first time I pumped."
131889,0,"This scale is light, easy to store, and simple to use. The shape of it makes it good for infants who lie down as well as older ones who can sit. Gives quite variable weights even if used for the same weight three times in a row. If you are really concerned about your child;s weight gain would recommend buying a more expensive professional medical scale. If you are simply keeping a rough tally of weight gain then quite okay."
9186,2,"This CD is the worst!! I have replaced the batteries 3 times in one week!! And the volume is terrible, you can barely hear the music, even on the loudest setting."
147176,1,"This pattern is adorable for a boy or girl! The colors really catch a babies eye - our daughter loved to look at her bumper with all the animals and bright colors when she was a newborn. We've since had to remove the bumper because she's 4 months but still loves her sheets, etc. Words of advice...we registered for this at babiesrus but purchased many items from Burlington Coat Factory which was much cheaper."
31324,1,"I use this to hold several of theDr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Standard Neck Bottle, 4 oz - 3-Pack. I put the inserts through the holes in the top rack and everything dries very quickly. Very pleased."
182247,1,this is an awesome potty and the kids really like to use it- it's designed with their comfort in mind- I just wish there was a spot on the side that dipped in alittle to make emptying it easier- it ALWAYS drips on the floor- no matter how slow or fast you turn it over- just keep wipes nearby to clean up! they loved the book and video though!
83669,2,"I bought these thinking that I could cut out my wipes also, but so far, I haven't used them. They don't work well dry at all, so I would have to have some form of a system to keep them wet, and with a toddler running around, that isn't too practical for us. Great quality though!"
163977,1,i have the kind of pack that wraps around you 10 times and a SNUGGLY (R)and this one is my favorite becuase if the bay falls asleep all i want to do it get him out without waking him up. I unclip the top buttons (easy); up clip the side belts (easy); pull the velcro apart from his sides (a little noisy but not enough to wake the baby) and i lay the whole thing down on the carpet just so he's not sweating bullets. This si the only pack i could do this with...so i'm super happy with it!. He did like it for our outdoor strolls. I did not like the belts across the back becuase the button the belts feel through kept sliding up my back and taking my shirt with it. But overall my favorite pack to date
1487,1,Quality as usual good .. very goodBest thing is cost - Lowest anywhere when you take advantage of 10$ off of 49$
79663,1,"I was looking for a toy box to store toys for my 2 year old granddaughter when she visits. This one was priced reasonably, and came in perfect condition, exactly as pictured. It was actually larger than I expected, which I consider a bonus. The pull out tote is perfect for smaller toys and travel."
109804,1,"In general we are pleased with the bed rail we purchased for a twin bed for our grandson to use. It was a little confusing to install at first but once we got the instructions straight in our head it wasn't bad. It seems to be of high quality and very sturdy. Our only problem is that when we want to drop the side down, the rail is taller then the distance to the floor from between the mattress and box spring so it leans instead of dropping straight down. We only use the bed for our grandson so we leave the side up. I would probably buy another and may eventually purchase the companion for the other side of the bed. The price was much less than others we looked at so we were happy with that aspect."
128830,1,I got these for my 9.month-old as i had already bought the number 4s and the flow was too fast for her. Number 3s are perfect for her now at 9 months.
95882,1,"My son (5 months) LOVES the jumperoo. He will jump around in it for a good 30 minutes or more! The past few days he's been teething and the Jumperoo is the ONLY toy that will keep him occupied, happy, jumping, laughing, and not crying! :) It would be nice if there was a variation of music, but our little guy doesn't seem to mind. :) We were so excited when his legs were finally long enough for him to actually be able to jump in it! I would HIGHLY recommend this toy."
80365,1,Perfect fit for davinci Emily mini crib. I like how it's thicker than most mattresses. Simple and to the point
112325,1,"I just love these diepers! There are light, not bulky, good absorbency, and soft (not like Huggies). I tried many different types, but keep coming back to Cruisers!"
19135,1,I had a hard time figuring it out at first. Then I decided to go online and watch the video on how to use it. It helped alot. I like the sling I just have to get used to it.
62139,0,"This is a decent conditioner. It makes my hair soft and detangles well. I love that it's all natural, but I can't stand the smell. It's a grapefruit scent, but extremely bitter. Other than the smell it's a nice product, but I won't be buying it again."
17478,0,"I didn't do very good research before I bought this chair and now after 2 years I wish I picked a different one. The 2 reasons I bought this chair were:1. I liked the neutral tone of the fabric2. I thought the wheels moved better than some other chairsI was a little worried about the fact that it had a fabric seat cover instead of a plastic one, but I thought that the plastic wouldn't be comfortable for my baby. I also thought that the Fisher Price Aquarium high chair was so ugly and gaudy that I didn't want it in my kitchen. BIG MISTAKE!My Complaints:1. Take it from me- get over the pretty fabric and buy a chair that is more useful. Your nerves will be so happy you did. I haven't had any problems with the fabric bunching up when I machine wash it, and stains come out of the cover easily if I wipe them up right away but I every time I'm wrestling the cover off the chair to wash it, I wish I had a vinyl cover that I could simply wipe off and be done with.2. My second big complaint is that in addition to the tray being too high, the gap between my son's belly and the tray is so big, he's constantly dropping food in his lap. My son is large for his age and even at almost 2 years old and 30 lbs., he still has that big gap. I didn't realize that other chairs were different until I tried out my friend's Fisher Price Ocean Wonders chair. That tray can be pushed right up to his belly and there's no way the food can fall in his lap. Soooo much better! Plus, despite the ugly fabric, the cushion wipes off so easily she never has to take it off to wash it.Overall the chair has stood up quality wise, but practicality wise it's a huge pain and provides many unnecessary headaches for parents."
6589,1,I have tried just about all of teh diaper brands out there. These hold up the best with leeks. Every diaper would leave my son soaked by the morning except these. they have only leak a few times. Much better than all the rest. They do deposit a little bit of lint but the trade off is worth it. My son is a very active 2 year old and these diapers don't stop his movement at all. I am very happy with these diapers and have been using them exclusivly for the last year and a half.
47069,1,"5 star for it's niche in double stoller uses.Light, easy to load in the trunk, and the kids hands down favorite double. Easy to manuever. Used daily to transport two kids 18 mos and 3 yrs in and out of daycare. I keep the shade and snack tray off for simplification in and out of daycare. When we have used it for longer outings I replaced the tray and shade.We have other doubles, one heavy in-line with all the kiddie comforts, bells and whistles but too big for the trunk and heavy to push. One double jogger/bike trailer combo style for off road and side-by-side kids, also too big for the small trunk."
50234,1,"The title says it all, when using this Super Soft Strap Cover with your little ones carseat you are making them more comfortable by using these covers by the little ones neck as well as keeping the neck more safe and more secure. Great for the littest ones to the Biggest ones. Our just loves her Kiddopotamus Cushy Straps!"
140590,1,"My husband gave me a lot of grief for buying the most expensive swing, but after the second day of owning it, he shut his mouth and made me dinner.The swing is a little more then the others, but well worth the extra money. It has the option to face forward or swing side to side, which is wonderful. You can reline the seat, so the the baby is able to lay back, a great feature when they're so small in the beginning. The Mobile turns around, which my infant never seems to tire of. The music has four different settings, and each song is so long it takes forever to repeat, so thankfully, you don't feel like you're hearing the same irritating three notes over and over. And, if you can believe, the music is actually soothing... not like nails on chalkboard!Also... you can plug it into the wall, so you don't use batteries! I can't even imagine how much I have saved with this feature. Its fantastic. Nothing else on the market plugs in now.My recommendation is spend the extra few bucks and get this fantastic swing, you won't regret it for a second, but you will kick yourself when you get the low end one without all the features."
164277,0,"I have to agree with other reviewers, I just don't get why they changed the diapers to be so crunchy and chemical smelling. I had not planned on using Pampers but we were given pampers in the hospital and loved them and decided it was worth the extra to stick with them. But going to try others. If you like these new stinky pampers, Amazon has consistently had the best price."
713,2,"I decided to try the Pampers Dry instead of our usual Pampers Swaddlers in hopes of keeping my son more comfortable overnight, because he sleeps 8-10 hours. Huge mistake! These diapers made him more uncomfortable. He has huge sores on his bottom from these diapers. The sores developed in a little more that 24 hours of use. It started as redness and then turned into sores. At 6 months old, he has never had an issue with redness or even had diaper rash. I feel so bad for switching. Beware."
14203,1,"We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great. He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast. We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you. So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!"
154064,0,"I just received a box of these and compared them to the ones I have. Just wanted to let everyone know the ingredients have changed quite a bit. The quantity per pack went from 80 to 70. Lastly, they cut the size of each sheet by 1/2 an inch. I didn't notice these changed when I ordered them or I would have compared everything to the other ""safer"" brands out there before I made my purchase. I have been buying these for over 4 years and there have been some slight changes in ingredients but never this much."
76903,2,"It seems like this is a great product but a few things are driving us crazy (which is not what we need right now). The swing stops swinging after you turn on the little mobile. Something about the extra power or gearing needed to turn the mobile and get the swing going seems to fail. We often here our baby girl start crying to look over and see the swing stopped swinging (although you can hear the motor still running). The light also goes out after a certain period of time. There must be a good reason behind this but we find it to be impractical, I wish there was an option to turn the timer off. The build quality seems good but a swing that will not swing well... doesn't get my best score. I have contacted the company and await reply."
10787,0,"This was great to pump milk right in to, using the Madela hand held pump, as attachments screw right in to the bottles. After pumping milk, they seal up very nicely, and store in the fridge airtight. However, after heating the bottles, and screwing in the nipple attachments to them, our baby didn't feed well out of them, much too fast of a flow, messy, and the latex nipples had strong latex smell, (and I imagine latex taste to baby, we prefer silicone)our baby rejected feedings from these bottles. Nipples were much too small, also, baby would put entire mouth around them, not practical for switching between bottle and breast. I ended up just using them to pump and store milk in, and would nurse baby, and then pour milk in to Playtex Nurser bottles with silicone nipples, to take with me for outside feedings."
119035,1,"Love it. It took a little time to arrive (about 2 weeks) but arrived completely intact. It was favourably reviewed by many people and on a recent vacation to San Diego we met many parents with babies and young children who had the same travel system so I asked them what they thought of it and there were only positive comments. It was easy to assemble. Seems sturdy and light enough for my wife to lift if I'm not around. Yes, it is a little bulky but not to the extent that it's a problem. We decided to get a second infant carrier base so either of our cars can be used. That was easy and Amazon sold the one we need for not much money. That will be arriving today. The price is great and the quality is high so we're delighted. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with a baby/toddler."
129952,1,"It is what it says it is. It is the infant car seat base for specific Graco infant carriers. Not much to say, it works."
124214,2,"Poor packing and arrived without hardware. Amazon wanted to replace the entire unit when I asked for just the hardware. Ridiculous. Very poorly packaged and Amazon was unwilling to work with the manufacturer to replace the hardware on my behalf. After it arrived, was unboxed (box looked like it had been opened before and was ripped in several places), hauled up a flight of steps--- they expected me to pack it back up and ship it back to them just to get a bag of bolts. Right. First bad experience I have ever had with Amazon. If you like this bed, resist the temptation to buy from here and go to the manufacturer instead would be my advice."
109015,1,"i've been using this for over a year now. it's definitely saved our knees when bathing our son! the padded part that hangs over into the tub also helped save my son's head a few times. he LOVES to play (more like thrash!) around in the tub. only negative is that it doesn't dry well afterwards (i hang it to dry after each bath) and smells awful, like mildew, after just one or 2 uses. easy enough to wash but a pain to have to wash it every few days! but nice that it folds up when not in use (and once it's dry). i've only used the pockets when there is only a little bit of body wash left and i have to keep the bottle upside down to get all of it out so the pockets proved useful to keep them in the upside down position."
795,2,"Pampers are good quality, pretty good protection against blowouts, etc. But we have two complaints. First of all, there's a mesh on the inside that sticks to baby's bottom pretty consistently. Worse, for us, the ""dry"" part is because of chemicals in the diaper, which caused our baby to develop red, rashy skin very quickly. We've since read that this is a common issue with Pampers, especially ""dry max"". Overall, I would not recommend these to a friend. Huggies and others have worked far better for us."
25072,1,"This gate is so awesome! It is by far the best gate we've ever had. It is pressure mounted so it doesn't mess up your walls, yet it is sturdy enough that it doesn't come loose. Installation was simple for my husband to do, only took about 5-10 minutes. I love the hands free feature, it is cumbersome to have to fool with a gate with a heavy baby in your arms but this gate solves that problem. Best of all is that my 4 year old can open the gate on his own by standing on the foot pedal with all of his weight so I don't have to constantly let him in and out of it, all the while keeping my 10 month old safely inside. The only tiny thing that would make it even better is if the gate door swung closed on it's own. The price is reasonable, too. I highly recommend this gate!"
82011,2,"Very frustrating that my milk is wasted when the bags leak upon defrosting, even when defrosted in the refrigerator . I used the olde bags with my first child, the ones with the pouring handle. This new brand is horrible."
86256,1,"First time parent. Great clear picture, automatically adjusts for day or night view. video turns off after set time to save battery. Rechargeable battery. Don't think the battery (Lithium ion?) is replaceable though. Works great, highly recommend it."
71705,1,"I wish it were possible to leave a review without a rating. From what I've seen, this is a nice enough product and especially desirable for adults with lower back problems or for children with special needs (or a determination to be upright before they are developmentally ready to walk independently). It is a modern take on the old-fashioned leading strings, which were ribbons sewn directly onto the child's clothes for this purpose.But if you go look at the other kind of ""reviews""--that is, what the parents selling it used on a famous online auction site say about this in their listings--it sounds like a lot of families only got to use it for a few days or a couple of weeks at the most. So if you're a daycare provider who sees a different group of kids in this age range every year, or if you have a large family that you can pass it around as part of the hand-me-downs, then this might be great, but if not, you might wait a while to see whether you actually need this kind of thing before you shell out a lot of money for something that you might not use."
48909,1,"We needed a playpen for our very active 1-year-old, and did a lot of shopping before choosing this one. We LOVE it. First of all, it is HUGE, for a play yard. It completely fills up the open area in our small living room, which we actually like because our little one doesn't feel like he is in a cage. The 8 panels makes for a very generous playing area - room for lots of toys and floor space too. I love that I can position it in a square, a rectangle, a rounded octagon or (our favorite) an elongated octagon. We have thick carpet, so moving it around by pushing it has not been as problem. We have not tried it on a hard floor, but I look forward to trying it outside.We have attached toys to the inside walls (the kind you would normally attach to a crib, and also with rings) so it is interactive without having to buy a playpen with toys integrated in the walls. It's colorful, nice and tall, and the holes are small enough that he has not tried to climb out of it. I do wish I could have chosen the colors - I would like 2 colors instead of 5, or 4 colors, with 2 panels of each, but that is mainly my own finickiness. This product also comes in white.You can fold it up and put it away when not in use. It still takes up a bit of space, but it's flat/square so it can be stored upright (say in a closet), or flat (like under as bed). Certainly it does not take up as much space disassembled as those yards made of big clunky hollow plastic panels.Sometimes we use it with one panel open, so he can go in and out. I love that we can do that, but when my son leans on the walls, which he likes to do, it bends way down. It's not ""floppy"" per se, but I do wish the plastic was a LITTLE heavier. I should note, though, that when all sides are connected, he can lean his full 25 lbs on it, and it does not bend or move significantly.All in all, a good price for a good play pen!"
139687,1,Got these for each of the two granddaughters and they love them. Different colors of stars and auto shut off. Wonderful!!!
117705,1,"I buy it for my nephew, I wish he may like it. I may recommend it to my friends if it is really good."
100160,1,"After 5 kids, we used all kinds of diapers. While some store brands were less than expected, Pampers, Huggies, and Luvs were the ones that performed the best. As long as it holds in what it's supposed to hold in, I could care less what they looked like!"
155545,1,"As stated by another reviewer, this is a bright red sheet. That is why I got it. The picture is a deep red, so I was very happy when it arrived and is bright and vibrant. The fabric is soft."
109725,2,"I bought this two years ago at BabysRus, and there were two rubber ducks in the package. I purchased this for my friend's baby shower couple weeks ago and there were no rubber ducks in there anymore. It still shows that comes with rubber ducky on the description. I am very disappointed as I was expecting this rubber ducks the most.Please fix the product description..."
106474,1,"This was the best diaper pail that I have had yet. I tried the diaper genie and a couple others, but this one held the odor at bay, my youngest child is now two and it was the best thing we ever found."
163436,0,"I liked that this chair didn't take up too much space. It works well, but the shoulder strap stitching is not sturdy. The part that connects to the waist isn't connected. Now I have to return it :-( She won't be strapped in properly."
98949,1,"I love Pampers diapers for my little one. They fit well, are great quality, and keep my baby dry."
50446,2,"When I was about 6 months pregnant, I decided to invest in a snoogle because I was getting no sleep at night. The first night I had it, I thought it was heaven. But then I started getting headaches every morning and realized it was because of the snoogle. It wraps around you so that the top part is actually used as a pillow. I am used to thick, soft, down-filled pillows, and the snoogle is very hard and uncomfortable. I guess if you like hard, cotton pillows, it won't matter, and in that case, this would be a great item. But I just can't sleep without a soft pillow for my head. I am now back to using a regular body pillow along with my normal pillows, so this item was a waste of money for me. I am hoping to get some use out of it when I start to breastfeed - if so, I'll write another review then :)."
167144,1,"This foot rest is great both prenatally and for feeding time. This great foot rest helps angle the feet so that you don't get pinching in the hips or tired feet. Also, this is great for dad when he wants to help feed the little one. Overall this product is great and can be used with rocking chairs and any chair really to transform it into a comfortable feeding place."
58717,1,"Philips Avent Express Microwave SterilizerThis is a wonderful product to have on hand for sterilizing bottles,nipples,etc. It's fast and does the job it's intended to do.I've given this as a gift three times, and they have loved using this product. Easy to use, fast and done in 4 minutes."
161735,0,"I received this tub for Christmas from my mother for my newborn. When I saw it at the store, I thought it was a great idea. However, when I finally got around to use it, it wasn't what I thought.For one thing, the sling does not fit in my sink. It has too much of an angle for me. So, I use the sling in the tub which is fine. As stated in another review, the sling should have been placed in the more shallow side of the tub and the bath ring on the other side.Lastly, it really doesn't store well. When compacted, it's still rather large. I have to put it under my newborn's crib after use. I have no other place to put it.I probably will keep using the tub, but I wish I would have told my mother not to buy it."
24490,1,"This gate has been up and in use 24-7 since I purchased it. I have had this gate for a little over a year and it is still going strong. Unlike other reviewers, I have not had any problems with the foot pedal. My 6 year old can open it but he has to hold on to the gate and jump up and down on the pedal with all his weight. He has been opening the gate this way since it was installed when he was 5. Even this abuse hasn't damaged my foot pedal. The only two negative things I've noticed about this gate are the fact that the actual opening of the gate is a little narrow especially if your a little larger than average and the rubber on the tension feet that hold it in place are tearing and falling off. The babies range from crawlers to toddlers just under 24 months old and none of them have been able to open this gate. The babies have hung on the gate two at a time shaking it but the metal construction can easily take the weight of two toddlers without showing any signs of stress or weakness. I like the fact that the gate doesn't use screws to permanently keep it in place and yet it's sturdy enough that I have been able to install it once and leave it up. After having used this gate, I feel the pros greatly out way the cons and I give this gate 5 stars."
137433,1,We got one of these pads within a gift package when our daughter was born. Prior to using this for the first time our daughter would constantly pee all over blankets we had laid down on her changing table! Needless to say we were doing laundry non-stop.Finding these pads at Target or Walmart or Sams Club is impossible. I was able to find these here on Amazon and got a case of 40. Well worth the cost for the simple no mess disposal after out little monkey pees all over everything!
28289,0,"this is the second glider that we have purchased, our other glider being a Shermag from Babies R Us. my husband said that this chair was easy to put together but we both agreed that our Shermag is better. this chair is significantly smaller than the Shermag which is fine for my small frame but it would be too small for my husband if he were to sit in it to give my son a bottle. i also really dislike how the wood is exposed on the edge of the arms of the chair -- my son has hit his head on this wood twice during night nursings -- the Shermag has completely covered arms. overall it's fine as a second nursing chair that i really only use at night but it would not work for my primary chair. i would buy a Shermag again."
172692,2,"This tub is the worst! I regret that I will have to drive all the way back to return it. We have not even had it 24 hours!We were excited to get it, thinking that the shower wand would be handy and fun. It worked once...poorly...then nothing. The motor is loud. The water takes a while to come out after pushing the button and stays on after releasing it. (Even the wand is hard to use the button is located in an akward location.) The stream is very weak and would not rinse well at all. The whole thing just feels cheap and rinky dink!"
32333,0,"This product is not nearly as good at the disposable change pads by Toys R Us brand, but unfortunately, those are only available in the U.S. stores. This product does keep the wetness from soaking through somewhat as long as the leak isn't too much, but the two layers are very thin and easily tear. If you can get Toys R Us or Huggies brands, they are definitely higher quality, but in a pinch these will work."
99472,2,"I have been loyal to Pampers diapers since my 13 month old was in Newborn Swaddlers. I tried these diapers because of the positive ratings and I am VERY disappointed. The diapers are rectangular and not good for a cruising baby. The front of the tabs turn under so they sometimes leak out the side. Also, they say they are suppose to last 12 hours. My daughter usually sleeps 10 hours straight at night and by morning the diaper has ""sweated"" pee through the diaper and through her pajamas and I've even had to change her sheets. I go through a lot more diapers with these because i have to change her very frequently. For some reason the Pampers Cruisers with dry max gave my daughter diaper rash so I guess I'm buying Huggies next time."
23523,0,"I live in Boston and love to go shopping in downtown. Because I could never find a parking space in downtown Boston,(garage paking is $15 an hour), I use the T (subway)and because it is very lightweight I can carry the stroller w/ my 26 lbs daughter in it and walk 2 feights of stairs. My daughter is 10th months old. There's is no problem of her sitting in it but she just doesn't like to stick her back to the back of the seat and since the sit area of the seat is short she always looks like she is gonna fall, thank god she's strapped in.Cons I found this stroller: 1) the seat is too small, 2) the two pockets on the side I never use because I rather have everything in my diaper bag for easy reach, 3) the recline clips get loose easily, 4)folding up the stroller w/ the canopy attached, oh my, the canopy is something to talk about. The canopy pops away from the stroller in the beginning because its still new have to break into it, but now the canopy is always in the way when changing positions. The clips of the canopy slides to the area of the recline clips and get in the way. You must use the cup to help seperated the the two. 5) the obvious would be no trays for both mom and baby and storage underneath. My 3 years old son fights to put his drink in the only cup holder while I try to find a spot to put my drink and the bottle, I usually stick them in the pockets on the side.Pros: 1) it is very lightweight, 2) do not take up space in the closet(I leave this stroller in my apt for sudden urges to go shopping w/ my kids), 3) the handles are very comfortable to hold, my hushand is 5'10 wasn't banding his back while pushing the strollerBelieve or not this is my 6th stroller, I still have my full size stroller in the car and an umbella stroller for my older one. I used to own a Babytrend lightweight stroller for $40 from BabiesRus (My in-laws used to sit my son when I was in school, and they loved to walk to the park so had to leave it at their house, but they always left it outside rain or shine, later I found out it was growing molds so had to trashed it. My 3rd one was also a lightweight stroller on sale for $40 from Kmart w/ Elmo in a beige color but it was stolen from my neighbors in the building. They both like full size stroller have trays for mom and baby and storage baskets and lightweight. My 4th one was an $10 umbella stroller from Target to travel back to Hong Kong with. I left it behind to a friend who wants it, and when I got back I bought the same one to keep (the one in the car).To be honest, I wouldn't have pick this stroller as top choices for a lightweight stroller but since I have spent a lot of money on strollers for my son I don't want to spend another dime on a stroller (I still have a very good full size stroller in the car, but doesn't want to keep it in the apt and it is heavy to use to travel on public transportations), so I used my reward points from a credit card to redeemed it. That way zero money spent.I have yet to use it in the summer, because the seat cushion can be removed for better air flow."
46094,1,My doctor originally told me about this mobile. Our baby would not even lay in her crib without crying until we got this. She absolutely loves it! She stares and laughs at it and coo's and caw's over it.
81188,2,"I bought this because I love the look of it and thought my daughter would enjoy a personal sized blanket. It is a beautiful blanket and very soft but if your baby is a chewer, then the fuzz from the ""Cotton Candy"" blanket will come off in their mouth. Also, the satin border is much stiffer than I expected. I bought a Little Giraffe chenille blankie that I am much happier with now!"
175069,1,"This tub is great! Our daughter outgrew her plastic tub that we used on the counter at 6 months. She was already sitting up on her own and she loves to be able to sit up comfortably and splash. The quacking noise was a plus since she has a little ducky toy that makes the same sound so she smiles and laughs every time we press it for her! I would have to agree with another reviewer that the suction doesn't seem to hold well but that is okay, just turn over to dry.I would recommend this tub to anyone!!"
107031,1,"I think it is prudent for parents to purchase some sort of disposal system for dirty diapers. The draw to this particular model/brand is the fact that it does not require special bags. We've had this item for 3 weeks, and so far, it works just fine. My daughter is breastfed, so I don't have the stink problems that others have noted (although I anticipate the smell will ripen once she is weaned). It is easy to use, easy to clean, easy to assemble."
162263,1,"It seems to be made of cheap and light wood. It's very light and it probably won't last for a long time. It's useful, well designed and works well for now, though."
63190,2,"This toy box seemed like just what I was looking for for my two boys' rooms to store all of their toys. A little assembly didn't scare me. But it was very awkwardly put together, and the bottom panel is this flimsy cardboard, which ended up collapsing and falling down. I am very disappointed in this product."
72654,1,"I love the born free brand, however, my son only chews on the spout as opposed to drinking from it compared to the nuby brand. I think with a little more time he'll get used to it."
168196,0,"They are diapers, and with an infant...well, it's not like he's going to complain about this.It does the job - keeps his clothes dry, and the poop in. I would NOT RECOMMEND this for night time sleeping if the kid is fortunate enough to sleep through a good chunk of hours (say 4-5) as the combo of poop and pee will cause an overflow and leak out. But for infants that have a sleep cycle of 2-3 hours at most, it seems sufficient.I would try cheaper diapers (say target and other store brands)....but i like the fact that they show up on my doorstep and the price isn't bad with the Subscribe and Save option."
121328,1,My daughter received this ornament for her baby that is due at Christmas. She thought it was perfect!
126936,0,"With my first son we stuck to Luvs brand diapers. It's what we'd received in the hospital and I never strayed from them. I was happy with their price and performance and never saw fit to venture on to other brands. With baby number two we received Huggies and I thought I would give them a try. I like the fact that they are roomy diapers, and the waist closures are very flexible. The diapers get good coverage, but don't hold much. I had to change my son every half hour, regardless of how much he'd gone- because the moisture would leak through the bottom of the diaper. We have since gone back to Luvs and haven't had that problem. Huggies might be good for newborns, but the bigger the size- the less they worked for us. We definitely suggest Luvs over Huggies. Save yourself the time AND the money."
74264,1,"Well, we have 3 kids under 4, so I had to break down and buy a stroller. We have the sit n stroll car seat which is FABULOUS. Just love it. We have 2 and so the youngest always rolls. Or dad will push one and I will push one, it converts to a booster seat at the restaurant and then we roll away. But, I was finding that occasionally, I want to take the 3 year old and the 2 year old somewhere and needed a stroller. We have joggers, single, the double,, and the triple, but they are just TOO big! After much research, the joovy kept poppin' up, so I got an orange one and we LOVE it. It's bigger than I expected, (i guess I was thinking a child's umbrella was coming in the mail). BUT, much smaller and easier to fold and pop up than the jogger. It's sturdy, has big wheels, and really, is the coolest looking stroller I've seen in awhile-sorry but cool looks is a must if you're heading towards brady bunch size with your family. We don't carry a lot and are used to no cup holder and no storage (if you've ever seen the sit n stroll, you'll understand). My kids just love it. Of course, they never get to ride once they walk, so this stroller is like an ice cream cone at our house.Also, I know you're not supposed to do this, but the 3 and 2 year old can fit on the back part and the 4 month old can ride in the front, hence, it can stroll three young ones quite easily. We don't get out much, but this makes getting out 100 percent easier."
57739,1,"These diapers are great. I didn't like that Seventh Generation diapers are beige, which makes them look dirty, they are also not 100% Chlorine free (read the small print on their package). I would say for younger babies Tendercare might not be soft or squishy enough but for older kids I like that they are not bulky and are easy for them to move around in. The only disadvantage to this diaper is not sticky tabs which lose their stickiness if you get any lotion or ointment on them."
86666,1,This is great. A little flimsy with the velcro attaching hood thing but otherwise really good. We put it inside the co-sleeper and this seems to be a great infant sleeping arrangement.
147401,1,"I bought two of these, one for my diaper bag and one for my husband's. It was easily attachable to any part of the bag, and we were able to thread the strap through loops on the bags. It easily holds two pacifiers, and may fit three if you squeeze. Definitely better than I expected, and easily washable. I have several Essentials brand items, and they've all been up and above standards. I'd definitely buy this product again if I needed to."
165318,1,"Because these diapers are cheaper on Amazon and thinner than the Cruisers, I originally thought that they were Pampers ""economy"" line. But when my one-year-old daughter started leaking every night in her Cruisers, I went looking for an overnight diaper and found that these were the ones. What a difference! We have never had a leak in the Baby-Dry diapers. In fact, the one night since buying these diapers that I had to go into my daughter's room at 3:00 am and found that she had soaked through, when I took off her PJs, I saw that my husband had forgot to change her out of her Cruiser diaper before putting her down for the night.If you want to prevent nighttime leaks, these definitely work."
7015,0,"A little slow on shipping since I qualify for free shipping. However, the fact that you receive these via post is great. Saves another trip to the store."
34725,2,"This car seat does not fit in the rear facing position unless you own an SUV or minivan. My husband and I both tried to fit this seat in the rear facing position into several cars with no luck. The slope of the seat is so steep that it does not fit into a normal size car. We finally were able to fit this seat into one of our cars (after struggling with it and stuffing a towel underneath to make it sit level)when our baby was ready to be forward facing. After using it for a while, I found the straps constantly twist around making it difficult to tighten. Additionally, the design of the ""puzzle buckle"" doesn't do much but make it difficult to strap a wiggling toddler into the seat.Another issue is the strap at the bottom used to tighten the straps at the top. Well it works, but only tightens on side and then you have to keep adjusting the straps up top until it tightens both sides. It's really more of a hassle than anything. I do not recommend this car seat unless you have unlimited time and patience."
13450,0,"I really like the idea behind this power cover, but it really just doesnt get the job done if you have large plugs plugged it (say from a printer or something). It will not close. Also, if you only have small ones and do close it, it is near impossible to get open again to change our plugs. So IDK. If you are using it in a place where you wont be moving plugs around and have no large plugs, I would say buy it. Otherwise... find something else."
162071,2,I loved this tub for a while and thought that everyone that had experienced leakage had put it together wrong. Then we started having leakage every now and then. It seems random when it leaks and we can't figure out what makes it worse at times than at others. I would rather have a tub that is all one piece.
7291,0,The bed is beautiful but the protection guard is too short and I found my toddler sleeping in the floor two times. We solved the problem by putting another removable guard and closing the side completely. It does not look as good and she needs to jump them to get to bed now but at least I don't have to worry about her falling off the bed.
21012,2,"(Bought by Grandma, review by Mommy.) We have done handprint and photo frames with our 2 older children and had no trouble with the ""clay"", but the texture of this clay was very different - more like a putty. It was hard to push my child's hand into the putty, it didn't show the fingerprints (like the other 2 had done), and by morning it had lost most of the impression. Since it wasn't completely dry, I tried the other side of the putty and pushed even harder, but within an hour most of the definition was gone. We will probably go to a craft store to find some decent clay rather than attempt to work with customer service to get another batch of putty."
88208,0,"My Little brother had this toy. He loved it when he was about a month old and started really playing with it. he became less as he got older, and when he was walking, he would try to use it for support, it didn't hold so he fell A LOT! It's nice that the toys come off because he is now almost 3 three and there are toys from it all over the place. It did last though, but I think it's to expensive."
141051,1,I bought this for my daughter who has a 9 mo old baby. It has a stainless steel blade that works great. It readily grinds cooked foods including meats. She loves it taking it everywhere she goes with the baby. Everyone that sees her using it loves it and wants to know where she got it.
25242,2,"After reading reviews about poor stability - in addition to the 20 buck price tag - my husband and I decided to get the 5"" bed risers (or lifters) sold at BBY. We are very happy with our purchase - the feet (castor and non-castor legs) both fit in the space allotted. It seems a lot more stable than the Arm's reach extenders - and you can't beat the $7.99 price!"
57513,1,I love this set! I washed the fitted sheet and it did seem to shrink a little but not enough to cause any problems. It fits very snug now! I have had many compliments on this bedding from friends. I am very happy with this purchase.
176081,1,This dresser is great and looks very nice in the babies' room. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it took 5 hours to put together (have 2 screwdrivers and it may not take you as long :) ) It is very sturdy and will work great as a changing table also.
34547,0,"Pros: Cheap, appropriate size, small opening for lid good for keeping little hands out, uses regular garbage bags, easy to hose out once in a while, odor was relatively well-contained, second life as regular garbage can when you remove the lidCons: For the longest time, we got away with filling up the entire can before taking the diapers outside, and the smell was not a problem. However, the little deodorizer insert into the lid got squashed one too many times when we overfilled the can, and one day, of course, that unit broke off and we were left without a deodorizing unit. Of course, moving on to solid foods, we had to empty out the can more often, and without the deodorizer, the smell got worse. However, I bought a bunch of ""stick ups"" and periodically stuck one to the inside lid of the can and that worked pretty well. I used this for about 2 years before the hinge gave way. I saw somebody else had reported the same thing. 2 years is about when we started potty training, so all in all, it worked out. Probably planned obsolescence. We will buy a new one (same type) for a new baby."
80262,1,It is totally comfortable and roomy. One of my favorite features is the velcro on the sides of the carseat and the straps....it holds the straps to the side while you get the kid settled in. I would definitely buy one again. Only negative is that it has no cup holder. Luckily there is room in the carseat next to my son for his cup.
164438,1,Love ordering these from amazon! It's so simple and easy! It's great not having to run to the store to get diapers - these are delivered right to my door! What could be better than that?
150452,0,"Nice cloths. However, the packaging is awful. They are rolled up and and individually taped with clear tape. Extremely difficult to take off of the cloths and it virtually ruins the cloth by pulling off so much material with the tape."
84345,1,"The item, is most likely to be enjoyed by any infant at the age they state in the item description,everything is good top of the art Fisher price product... my neece will enjoy"
84454,1,"I am a mother of a 5 month old and was debating long and hard between this swing and the Little Tikes swing after reading many reviews. I must say I am happy with my purchase. After reading other reviews on this swing I was worried about the ropes, but maybe I'm just lucky because my husband didn't have any trouble. We had this swing up and swinging in less than 10min with no trouble and it swings straight. I don't see my son using it longer than maybe 18 months it looks more like a great infant swing and early toddler age. I will probably get something more heavy duty when he gets older. But so far I like it and my 5 month old gave it a big smile :)"
145453,1,My 5 month old loves this jumper! The music is really cute when she bounces to it! She's an active baby so I would definetly recommend this product to anyone out there who needs a 15-25 minute break if their baby is active. It's great for strengthening their legs as well. This was the best money spent on her so far! Great product!
91611,1,"The Graco TurboBooster is the ubiquitous booster in all the minivans and SUVs around the elementary school grounds for a reason- it's so easy to use and lightweight. Great for transferring from one car to the other or just if you want to fold down the seats when you're hauling something without the kids in tow. It's comfy enough for the kids to sit on long car rides (our kids have been in it for 4-1/2 hour stretches at a time without complaint). I easily took it from the taxi to the luggage check-in to rental car as we traveled with it. Just be sure to put it in a plastic airline bag when you're checking it as the two pieces do tend to come apart easily. That's handy when you want to remove the back as they kids get older and just use the base as a regular booster.Great lightweight, adaptable and transportable seat for all kinds of situations that grows with a child from toddler to 8 years old."
110051,0,"I have a different version of this car seat, and we own a Toyota RAV4. The seat worked great when she was little, but now that my daughter has gotten bigger (she's 3) her legs reach up to my headrest. Because this seat is so elevated, when she stretches her legs out, she is kicking me in the head. It's very frustrating. I wish it wasn't so tall. Plus, picking her up to put her in it, or take her out can be difficult (like if she fell asleep somewhere) because she now weighs 37 lbs. Well, you have to LIFT her to put her in it. Now, keep in mind, we have this installed in the middle of the back seat. If she was on either side, this wouldn't be a problem. But, even when she's awake, she has to CLIMB into it. Also, the foam that surrounds her head broke very easily when I hit it wrong one time lifting a sleeping baby into it. We are now replacing it with a Graco Nautilus. I already like it better! This seat is much lower."
111277,1,"This cover is exactly what I've been looking for. Large enough to cover me and the baby both while nursing, but not so heavy that it's smothering. The opening at the top is great to be able to peek down at her, or see when she's latching on. I love it, and would definitely recommend it."
7431,1,"My cousin told me about the this product when I was looking for a stroller. My husband and I were not impressed with any of the travel systems out there, and thought this was a great alternative. I have found it to be SO easy to use. It is fabulous for someone who had a c-section because it is so light to lift. The basket fits my diaper bag and several other items. Our son has outgrown his infant seat unfortunately and we needed to purchase a regular stroller. I would still recommend looking into and registering for a future stroller. But I would still use the snap 'n go in a heartbeat!! It was very easy to put together as well."
154707,2,"I wish I had taken the advice of other reviewers before purchasing an entire case of these! I had barely gotten over the pain of having to return a case of the Nature Babycare wipes (chemical ingredient concerns that I didn't notice until after ordering). The 7th Gen wipes are smaller than most other wipes and quite dry no matter where you are in the stack or how you store them. I had to use twice as many just to get the job done. **Beware of having to pay return shipping costs!! It really cuts into your refund. Perhaps buying a single pack somewhere to try them first would be advised. Hopefully, the Earth's Best reviews hold up and we'll have found our wipe to stick with. Cheers! And good luck!"
165393,2,"I read the reviews before I buy this, I don't know how others are not have the issue I had. Every one says this baby dry diaper is very perfect for their kid. But one couple of them mentioned it is leaking. The same thing happened with our kid. The first time I used this we saw the leak all over his dress and we thought we haven't dressed him perfectly. But that's not true, every time we used this diaper there is leak almost 4 times out of 5. We are not at all happy with this product. Before using this we tried Cruisers and that one is perfect. Just that because this baby dry is little cheaper than cruisers we thought of giving it a try. We learned the lesson that cheap ones wil not the great ones always. I would not recommend this to any one."
48592,2,"I give it one star for fitting the description of a highchair and one for being aesthetically appealing. Other than that, all that I can say is it's the type of thing you buy for your first child but definitely not your second.I just had to have this chair because it was beautiful and matched my kitchen. Live and learn.The tray didn't come close enough to my son's chest so he could climb out even when he was strapped in. We literally had to tie him in there to get him to stay put.And cleaning was an absolute nightmare. It should have come with about 3 spare seat covers because it seemed like the one we had was always in the wash. Eventually I ditched the seat cover but then there was the problem of cleaning the wood- especially with all those crevices. At times I had to scrape food off with a butter knife and after a while the wood became water damaged because it wasn't sealed very well. This chair was heavy and difficult to move as well.It converts into a youth seat if you remove a few screws, but when we tried it out, it was way too high and my son could barely fit his legs under our kitchen table which is standard height.After about a year, I sold it in the classifieds to some poor first-time parent and bought a fashionable plastic high chair at about half the cost.My SIL has this same chair and she hates hers, too.First time parents take note: this pretty chair isn't worth the hassle."
102260,1,"I am a first time mother and it happened to be identical twin sons. I own a graco infant carrier and it really does fit well inside... I own this stroller in blank and have never looked back!I decided to NOT purchase a huge tandem, and my friends got me this one for my shower. Its easy to put babies in safely. It keeps the babies in sturdily and they never rock at all. The wheels arent as sturdy as higher priced strollers, but they work just fine and we have never had a problem except on wet tile floors (in malls when its rainy outside and peoples shoes are wet or somethig) but it always keeps going. Its so lightweight and takes up a very small fraction in my SUV, perfect when you have two children. It folds very easily and I have never struggled in the parking lot. The stroller manuvers well and I chuckled seeing huge single travel systems trying to push through christmas iles and I was able to fit nicely with a TANDEM!! The compartment holds my keys, wallet, cell phone, drink, sunglasses ect. and its really handy! The basket is nice a roomy and always accesable, stores alot of bags or jackets or whatever.It was also very easy to put together. All you have to do is look at the pictures for the different carriers and make easy adjustments. My husband had it put together in all but 45 minutes (some confusion when he refused to use directions at first).I am really dreading when I have to give up this stroller, its all anyone asks for in a stroller, longevity, durablity, lightweight, accomidates infant carriers, stable, manuverability, and it matches any infant carrier (the stroller comes in blue and black). I would recomend it to ANYONE."
60657,0,"We have been using our diaper genie for almost seven months now, and probably wouldn't use any others. It is easy to use and replace bags once you learn how. Our only problem is that when you open the lid to put in a new dity diaper, the smell comes out from the other diapers. We empty probably every other day, and we also clean it with Lysol every time we empty it, but it doesn't seem to help. It's better than taking the diaper outside every time though...you just have to plug your nose when you open it! I would still recommend it over some other brands."
177288,1,"I have been using the Ultrasoft Crib Matress Pad and it has saved me from all sorts of messes. It is absorbent and holds up to many, and I mean many, washings."
136138,1,this album is gorgeous. the light blue leather looks just beautiful with the silver bear. I bought it for my grandson's pictures.
62851,2,"We just had to have one because all of my mommy friends said they couldn't live without it. After replacing the first one 1 week after using it because it did not work properly, we are finally fed up with this product. The replacement diaper genie that we bought has not worked properly since we got it. Sometimes it twists the diaper and other times you have to open the lid and manually twist the diaper. If you use the cutter it gets stuck in the down position no matter how many times you try to unlock it and cuts holes in the plastic when you try to twist the diaper. It does not hold that many diapers and there is still a faint smell of baby poop in the air. Maybe because the cutter keeps cutting into the plastic. For something that is suppose to be so easy to use it sure is frustrating. Now I know why I see a ton of them in the consignment stores. Thats where ours is going now that we've replaced it with the Dekor Plus!!"
37026,2,After much research we purchased this seat hoping it would last our daughter until she no longer had need for a seat. We've had the seat for a year and overall find it sufficient. We are currently looking to replace this seat though because the straps get so easily twisted and make it VERY difficult to tighten them!!! The cup holder is also out of reach for little arms.
144349,1,We really like this Britax marathon car seat. We read a lot of reviews from people that had previously purchased it and based our decision to buy it on that. I can say that we have not been disappointed and it gives us comfort knowing that our daughter is in something that is safe.
125037,1,"My children loved this jumper, back when it was only an unattractive yellow uncushioned contraption.. Johnny Jump-Up.I was really happy to see the improvements when my granddaughters came along!These are wonderful gadgets.. teaching little ones cause and effect (my new grandbaby just tried it for the first time at about 3.5 months) and when they get older, great exercise for their little legs and just a lot of fun! It just tickles me to watch them in it, much better than tv or a variety of other things~You will definitely want to supervise them in this, but you'll want to!The top is a giant clamp that hooks to a doorway with molding. It's adjustable so you can start them lower to the ground and shorten it as they grow..I highly recommend this jumper.. if you have little ones and never use this, you're missing out!"
167719,1,"For a mom-to-be pregnant with twins, I thought purchasing a good hospital grade pump would probably be needed. I was gunghoe on nursing the girls...not to meantion the savings in formula costs. Well, I lucked out and found this one on ebay brand new in packaging for $130 - good deal, right? At $200, $300, or $400 this would have been a GREAT deal. This pump ROCKS! My girls ended up being born 8 weeks early and this allowed me to pump exclusively until the girls were ready to nurse - 3 months later! No need to rent a pump - this is a good as you can get without owning a huge cumbersome hospital unit. Plus, the car adapter was a must with me. I pumped while driving (not sure what the cops would have thought about that - but mom has to do what she has to do). Then it can take batteries - great if you want to take it to the county fair or a sporting event. Plus, it is totally compatible with all hospital pump parts (made by Ameda - my hospital used ameda). Any way - this pump saved me money on formula (I probably would have given up if my supply dwindled - but this pump kept it up there) and it allowed me to get out of the house. This thing was my best friend for 3 months straight. Highly recommended and easy to use!"
103399,2,"Like quite a few other reviewers said, the lock on this gate will eventually break - three of our four broke between 15-20 months after purchase. All in the same way, with the knob mechanism becoming stuck in the locked position. Seemed like a wonderful, simple to use gate at first, but what a total disappointment now."
138532,0,"Have a 3 year old that is scared to sleep alone in the dark. Thought he would LOVE this. He LIKES it, but can't say that he loves it. I do think it's pretty neat and he does use it every night. Was hoping for more...maybe if it included sound as well?"
45898,1,"Our little one loves this, he smiles and cues at it all the time. Keeps him busy for ten minutes at a time which is like an hour in baby time.My only complaint is you cant use all the pics,some are for facing down an some are for sideways viewing which baby cant see so i wish you could interchange all of the pics."
13820,2,"not useful as we want, we hoped it will be more helpful but it was not. The price not as it should be, sorry for this but it is our opinion.."
117369,0,"Although I love the gate functionality and one touch feature, my 9week old puppies chewed through the gate poles within 6 hrs of installing the gate! Wood was not the best choice of material."
32261,1,"I disagree with the reviewer that said this was of poor quality. It is a slipcover, similar to a pillow case - do pillow cases completely protect the pillow from drool and other things? Of course not. This takes the ordinary Boppy pillow and makes it a lot more comfy for mommy (or daddy) and baby. It is so soft and we love it!! Just throw it in the laundry when dirty and it'll come out like new."
154407,0,"The wipes work well, but they smell terrible. The box claimed they were unscented so I'm really disappointed. I usually buy the Kirkland brand but thought I'd try these because they seem more natural - I think I'll go back to the Kirkland's."
77883,0,"This bag was adequate protection for the car seat, but the wheels dont' have a fixed support, so if you don't get the car seat in the bag just right, the wheels don't sit on the ground properly, and hence, roll properly. Ended up dragging the bag across the airport parkinglot."
126062,1,"I've been using the Pampers for several months now. We didn't feel like paying the big bucks for the chlorine-free diapers anymore. These work well, seem to fit nicely and absorb well. I tried the Luvs, but found them too perfumed and they seemed flimsy overall and saggy when wet compared to the Pampers. I didn't give the Pampers a 5 star rating because when they're really wet in the morning, they can squish and get my sons PJ's damp, or even wet while I'm carrying him down for his diaper change. Other than that though, they work pretty good. 4 stars."
35860,0,"I bought these diapers for my 17 month old daughter. I'm not overly impressed with them so far. They are nice and absorbent and easy to use. The extra-long, attached insert is easy to use...you just double it over in the diaper. They wash and dry nicely.However, there are some things I do not like about these. They are rather bulky and I don't see how they would work well with a newborn. I also discovered that they will leak depending on what clothing my daughter is wearing. If she's wearing a one piece outfit or sleeper, they do not leak. If she is wearing something like jeans that pull up in the crotch area...the diaper will leak out of the sides. The leg openings don't seem to be fitted enough.I wouldn't buy any more of these. I like the Bumgenius, Happy Heiny's or Haute Pockets much better."
45607,0,"I'm so sorry, but I must write a negative review for the packaging of this product. The price was $60 and the box came without any reinforcements, it was crushed and the tape was not totally adhered to the carton. Even the UPS man documented a damage delivery. As the present is for a baby shower I'm not sure of its quailty until its opened. I've bought many things from Amazon, but this is my first disappointment"
168987,1,"I received this very quickly, even with Free Shuper Shaver Shipping! Product seems good. Not sure if it's really better than the Costco diapers I used previously, but they seem to be as good. Time will tell."
14284,1,"These bottles are simply the best out there. I know, I tried ""ALL"" of them."
86309,1,"We have been using this monitor for about a year now.It has been absolutely fantastic for us. We have the camera mounted high up on the wall and looking straight down to give a bird's eye view of the crib. It has saved us countless trips into the baby's room to see what was going on in there. I really believe that using this monitor has helped us train our daughter to sleep well because we didn't open her door every time time she cried out or we needed to investigate a noise. Very, very helpful.For those of you who are considering buying this monitor, I will try to set your expectations so you understand what you are getting.First, you have to understand that the video clarity isn't on par with high definition TV. However, it is plenty usable to see what a child is doing. The night vision is basically black and white, but it is amazing how well you can see in a completely dark room. I think that having the camera mounted to look straight down into the crib helps with night vision.Second, the reception and range depends a lot on the electrical interference you have in your house. This is the kind of product that you just have to buy and try to see if it works for you. It might not work if there are significant sources of electrical interference in your house. We do get an occassional static buzz but nothing serious. Repositioing the monitor normally fixes that.We did have a problem when the monitor fell off a table and hit the floor. The little plastic stand on the back broke. We called customer service and the sent out a new part right away at no charge. Can't beat that.I'd recommend this to anyone. Just make sure to try it out in the areas you are likely to need it."
131751,0,"I tried these because I was pumping milk, but my son was not a big fan. We did just a good with the basic nuk bottle and it was cheaper."
60849,2,"I had the Diaper Genie when my first child was a baby (he's now 2) and it was horrible! First of all, the refills are too expensive because they don't last any time at all before you have to go buy more. That in itself is a big turnoff. Also, most of the time you have to sit there twisting the stupid thing forever to try and get the diaper to stay wrapped up, and it still comes undone when you put another diaper in there. One of the worst parts is trying to empty it. Sure, it comes with a &quot;handy&quot; little safe blade built in, but that doesn't work either. I ended up having to use scissors anyway...and, although I'm well aware that dirty diapers stink profusely, and there really is no way to avoid the odor, but I think the refill bags may not be thick enough or something because the smell was completely unbearable! It was better to just buy small garbage bags to tie up the stinkies and throw them in the wastebasket (and much cheaper too-it definitely didn't smell as bad as the Diaper Genie did either). I constantly had to scrub the inside of the Genie out and still could not reduce the smell. I tried Lysol, other household cleaners, and even bleach and none of those reduced the smell (and this was without anything at all in it). Like I said earlier, I realize it is a diaper pail, and they are always a bit stinky, but this was a bit too much. I seriously had less of an odor just putting them in my garbage can tied up! All in all, I cannot say anything good about this product. Its not convenient to use, not easy to clean, and does not in any way, shape, or form &quot;eliminate odors&quot; like all the ads you see. Buyers beware, this is in my opinion the worst diaper pail on the market."
121262,0,"I really hate cheapo bags that start falling apart less than a year after you buy them. What I hate even more are really expensive bags that start falling apart less than a year after you buy them.We were really excited to receive a Dash diaper bag last fall as a new baby gift. We love the versatility that it gives us, easily going from the stroller to the shoulder. I also appreciate all the pockets that help keep us organized. Additionally, it looks great as a shoulder tote and stroller tote.However, I have to say that I'm disappointed in the quality of the bag we received. In February, after only three months of use, the shuttle clip insert on the shoulder strap broke. As I pulled on the shoulder strap, the plastic insert flew up and hit me in the forehead so hard that it drew a little blood. Not a month after that, the seam attaching the cover flap to the body of the bag started to come apart.Our Dash is barely 6 months old, and I'm now looking for a bag that is comparably priced but more durable."
95591,0,the hammock didn't say how big it was other than large. I was disapointed at the actual size. would not tell others.
183153,1,"This item is fun for the grandkids, not real durable, but if taken care of is well worth the money. It was put in a playroom for 2+ year olds to watch movies,etc and works well"
86994,0,"I have always loved the Playtex dropins bottles, and when I saw the new bottle design I was sold. Except for one thing, I tried to sterilize the bottles and they were warped from the heat. I am so glad I did buy them. I don't understand why this would happen its doesn't occur with the other Playtex bottles so now I just wash by hand and there is something wrong with this. And because of this I am giving it a lower rating."
138891,1,"Bought this for my Grandson who just turned 4 and he loved it, sleeps with it every night since he got it for his birthday....try to talk him into getting a blue one but he insisted that he wanted the Ladybug. The batteries are included with this item and it lights up the ceiling of his room with a soft light...."
48284,1,"After trying two other video monitors and taking them back, I was hesitant about the Summer Infant. Its been such a reliable product! We've had and used ours for over 2 years and hope to use with our next one coming soon. Occasional static, but to be expected from any product that runs on frequencies. We are hoping it lasts until our two year old daughter is in high school, so we can mount it outside her bedroom to catch her sneaking out : )"
70822,0,Just be aware that this kind of rockers don't rock well on carpets.Also the back recline is a little too steep for small babies
22939,0,"I bought this box so I can have my kids place their tooth in it, under their pillow and am mixed in how much I like it. It is cute, seems to be well finished but the lid doesn't stay on well (it is a loose fit) and it is a little larger than I had imagined. A tooth would swim in it, especially a baby tooth! I am not unhappy with it but not sure this is the direction I will go when my son looses his next tooth."
128882,1,It was the first nipple that our baby would take along with the traditional platex nurser. We ultimately had to use tommee Tippee bc this nipple had a bit too much give but it was a wonderful transition nipple that got us over the first hump.
55788,0,"Like the other reviewers have said - the warming time and amount of water it takes to warm the bottle vary from use to use.However, it's small, easy to clean and shuts itself off so there's no fear of starting a fire, or having a child touch it and get burned."
90670,1,"I simply love Pampers Baby Dry Diapers, Pampers has been my preferred brand of diapers ever since my daughter was born, she seemed to have a sensitivity to other brands of diapers and Pampers was available to me and I've been a loyal customer ever since!They don't bulk up, they are comfortable enough for my daughter to walk, run, sit, and stand in. They do hold pretty well, even for long periods of time (example overnight)."
151795,1,"I read other reviews where the changing table cover is thin. And, it is on the thin side. I put it over another cover and it fits very well and looks very good. It also holds up in the wash well."
159999,1,"We used one of these for each of our children when they were infants, made bathing in the sink safe and easy."
97023,1,"I wish the timer could be set longer than 45 minutes as it sometimes wakes my baby up when it turns off. Other than that, she LOVES it."
142251,0,"All front carriers do the same thing: help you carry your child while keeping your hands free, and keep your child close to your body for their comfort. There are many that do the exact same thing, so the real questions become a) how comfortable is it, and b) how long can you use it (will you get your money's worth).This is my third carrier. The first was a hand-me-down from a friend and I was never able to adjust it to fit right. My second was an Infantino Smart Rider. I figured since it was Infantino's top carrier it would be comfortable, but my back hurt so much I couldn't use it more than 15 minutes at a time, and my son fussed the entire time. I loved using a carrier, but I hated how much it hurt and I didn't know if getting a better carrier was worth the money if maybe my back would hurt no matter what I used. I bought an almost brand new Bjorn Active carrier for $32 at a children's resale store.THE GOOD: it is a MUCH better carrier than the Infantino. I used the Bjorn from the time my son was 4 months until around 9.5 months without back pain. It was easy to use and my son always seemed comfortable in it, and he was content to ride either facing me or facing out (though as he got older he preferred facing out).THE BAD: my son is now 20 pounds and he is already too heavy to use in the Bjorn, even though he is not near the maximum weight limit (26 pounds). I can only use it for 5 minutes before my back hurts, and I am disappointed by this. I thought the carrier would be good for longer, and I would have been very upset if I had spent the money on a new carrier and only gotten six months of use. I am now looking for yet another carrier, and this time I'm looking for something that will truly be comfortable so I'm considering an ERGO baby carrier (can carry up to 40 pounds and the weight is carried on the hips).BOTTOM LINE: if you think you'll only want to carry your child for a few months this carrier will do a good job, and you'll be more comfortable with this than with a similar carrier. But if you're looking for something that will work for an older baby, keep looking and find something that comfortably holds more weight."
72762,0,"We bought this monitor on sale and were thoroughly pleased. It has great range(so good in fact that I was able to run across the street to my neighbours to grab some milk while my daughter was sleeping). The blue light can be annoying but I just turn the monitor away from me when I sleep so that I can hear but not see it. As for the settings, the lowest one is perfect, you never hear any humming but when my daughter cries it picks it right away and quite loudly that any higher is not necessary unless you were in a loud room with a lot going on. All in all I say this monitor is great for what we need, and other friends of ours have bought more expensive ones which do not have nearly as good range as this one."
115082,1,This gate is a must if your child is a monkey like mine. We have two at our house (one keeping our daughter out of the kitchen and one for her bedroom door) and one at my in-laws house for the stairs. The gates always feel secure and don't budge no matter how much my daughter thrashes and bangs on them. I wouldn't use any other. I like how you only need one hand to open it and that it click shuts behind you. When your hands are full it makes life much easier.
56154,0,I have to agree with a few of the other consumers that complained about the hardware. The gate is so sturdy and seems to be of such good quality. The opposite can be said for the hardware. The hinges and hardware for the gate lock are plastic and really seem of low quality. I have had the gate installed for about a month now and it is still secure and my 10 month old is safe. I am going to keep a close eye on how well the hardware holds up.
91762,1,"We love this gate. We have one-year-old twins, and they push and pull and hang on the gate and it's completely sturdy. I agree with Emma, that I'm guessing the reviewers who gave this gate a bad rating probably didn't install it right. If you put it on the right setting, you can REALLY wedge it into your walls, door frame, etc."
35613,1,"I love this!! This is the best invention ever! I use this everyday with my 8 month old. The shopping carts are just full of bacteria & germs and you know babies they put eveything in there mouths, this cover covers the whole cart seat and resturant highchairs as well. I don't know what I would do without it."
103505,1,"I absolutely love this stool/seat... works great, and don'thave to sit on my knees while bathing my son.... would highly recommend!!!!!"
109110,2,This tray is horrible. It is hard to stick on the seat.The directions say not to lift the seat up when you are putting it on but there is no way to do that without lifting it! It is also a tight fit if your child is chubby. It presses against my sons stomach so we don't use it.
59905,1,"This tub is bulky, but great. It's like a real tub, and it does fit into a bath tub. It is highly easy to keep clean. And has two positions. One is a reclining position for a younger infant. In this position I would place a washcloth down before the baby to prevent sliding. The second position is for infants to sit upright. Great device. Is something that could be used for years or passed to family and friends as a hand-me-down. Well worth the price. No mildew issues at all."
171965,1,"the product was great but the packaging was terrible, i paid seven hundred dollars to collect t&t currency to recieve via skybox. i demand a refund"
64299,1,"This is a wonderful seat that is just right for toddlers and preschoolers. It allows just enough of a boost to sit up to the table without my son's knees rubbing on the bottom of the table. He loves the green color (I let him pick the color himself) and he loves the soft, ""squooshy"" feel. This is great for taking to grandparents house too as it comes in a nice carrying case."
1038,1,pampers makes the best diapers with the most varieties for your needs. however their collect points promotion is misleading. by the time you save up any worthwhile points your child will have outgrown the selection. also the shipping and handling fees out weigh the cost at any store. dishonest and mean spirited. next child will use lesser quality diapers but from a company with more integrity.
38523,0,"I did love this tub. I have used it for about 8 weeks and my baby loves getting baths. He is about 10 wks old now and I have noticed little bits of mold growing on the tub. I rinsed it after each use and hung it to dry. It might have gotten moldy bec I hung it to dry in the bathroom, and my husband and I take showers in this bathroom. I am very disappointed about the mold bec I really like the tub a lot. I threw it in the wash machine but the mold is still there."
85762,1,This is great product. we've had it up in our bathroom for a few weeks now. It only came loose once and that was because we hadn't had one of the tabs flipped all the way down. Just make sure to clean the surface well first.
140404,1,"I bought this for my newborn. When he was less than a month the he enjoyed the swing for a bit, but it gave him hiccups and he soon got irritated, so I stopped using the swing motion for about 3 weeks. I just placed him in it with the music and mobile on with a bottle or binky. He stopped associating the swing with a bad feeling (hiccups) and now, at 6 weeks he happily enjoys the mobile with the swing. Great sturdy model. plugs into the wall or takes batteries. great for many stages. folds up to if you want to move it once in awhile. Not exactly portable. You will need to designate a space for it. Takes up about 2.5 sq ft of floor and stands about 4 ft tall. Good item. I think it will outlast the baby and be useful for the next one."
157284,0,"These work great as burp cloths, but not actual diapers. The fit won't be snug and the diaper not absorbant enough. I hear some of the more expensive specialty diapers work better if you want to try cloth diapers. I gave up and went with disposable."
171976,2,"For my first child, I used a Safety 1st tub (which has its issues, too, but was for the most part pretty good). We had to purchase a new one for our second child and this was the only brand available at the store where we did our baby shopping.I found the sling to be difficult to adjust, and it didn't seem to allow our baby to be in the water while being bathed - he was sort of suspended above it. Once he became too big for the sling, I moved him to the tub itself and found the shape of it to be completely useless. I don't understand how the manufacturer could expect so many different sizes of babies to fit in that shape - he pushed up on the end of the tub with his feet, and it was difficult to keep a good grip on him while bathing him because the tub did nothing to help hold him up. After a few attempts at using the tub, I threw it out and went straight to the store to get the Safety 1st tub. Now I remember why I like it so much."
150592,1,"This is the best jogging stroller we found. We looked for something sturdy and nice looking and really hit the jackpot here. The best part is it can accommodate a very long stride without having the frame get in the way. I highly recommend this stroller for tall people. It doesnt have much in the way of a space for carrying supplies or a diaper bag but for serious running, this is the ultimate appliance"
104216,1,"This product did the trick, though my bannister is wrought iron, not wood. Installing it was not as simple as advertised, but I managed. Since I'm a grandmother with only occasional visits from farway grandkids, I wish this was more easily installed and uninstalled. I'll have to clip all the little attacher things to uninstall and try to find new ones every time I reinstall the guard."
85956,1,This monitor my husband and I purchased after trying several others and returning them. We love this one cause you can watch everything the little one is doing. Its absolutly awesome. We have cordless phones and dsl and doesnt really interfere. Its the best monitor out there. You can walk around with it too! Its handheld. Its nice sized and great quality.
88393,2,"Thinking that Amazon or DaVinci would have corrected their color labeling mistake by now (see previous reviewer's comment about the ""white"" dresser), we ordered this dresser for our nursery. As soon as the 100+ lb box arrived, I knew we'd be sending it back. The box was labeled 'Antique White', as a previous reviewer noted (months ago). I did open the box to compare the color of the dresser to the other white furniture we have in the nursery. Not even close. I can't comment on the quality of the dresser itself, as I made no effort to assemble it."
41205,2,"I have used Pampers on my baby since she was a newborn. I don't know why Pampers changed the cruisers. It used to be soft, have a great cover lining and be very absorbent.Now they are very papery, they took out the lining and it takes minutes for the diaper to absorb the pee. Also, the absorbent material goes only half way up the diaper.So disappointed! Just bought a 180 ct box..."
132876,1,"I bought this diaper pail because it was recommended by a friend. It is great, my son's room does not smell and the refills last a long time. I am on my second refill box after 7 months of use.There is some smell when you throw something away and change the bag but it is not bad at all. I especially like the fact that it is a one handed system so I can throw the diaper away and then continue to change my son. I also use it as a normal trash in his room.A great product."
12710,1,"When I purchased this product, I didn't expect much from the fetal heart listener. I am a labor and delivery nurse, and I know how hard it can be to listen to the baby's heart rate without a commercial doppler, so I didn't expect much. I was actually surprised that I could hear the baby's heart (at 30 weeks) which did come through sounding just like when you use a stethoscope to heart someon'e heart.....except the sound was very faint and you have to concentrate! I can see how someone not trained to listen to fetal heart sounds would have a very difficult time!However, I actually purchased the set so that I could play music for the baby, because I have seen much research on how classical music promotes fetal brain development, and I wanted the convenience of using ""headphones"" designed just for that purpose. They were comfortable and easy to use and worked wonderfully! It also enabled me to play the music for the baby while I watched TV, so I don't have to listen to the music if I don't want to. The set came with cd's and suggestions for how, when and how long to play the music, which I found very helpful.As an added bonus, I got the microphone to use so I can talk to and sing to the baby which also worked well....although I believe that playing the music is more important!Bottom line is......if you want a product for playing music that is easy to use....it's worth the price! (And everything else is just extra.)"
90140,2,"Like another reviewer, I went for these rather than the Pampers Swaddlers because I thought ""heck, these are also Pampers, how bad could they be?"" Answer: poop-storm. The inside of these are slick like they have some kind of wax coating. The poop just shoots right out the back, legs, everywhere. Terrible, terrible, terrible.Someone ought to track down and berate the bone-heads who thought this would be an OK design, right after they track down the bone-heads who sell unabsorbent baby towels (don't get me started on that).I would review further, but I have to go try to get poop stains out of our clothes, carpet and couch. Thanks for nothing, Pampers."
2053,0,"I tried these because it says Baby Dry on the box and my 1 year old floods these and all his bedding by morning. So, I don't really care for them."
178192,1,"I have used these bags for over 5 months now with no complaint. The double zip lock is much better in keeping the milk sealed, preventing leaks, and in tampering. The measurement lines on the bag is deceiving, but you can write the actual amount on the bag. I tried gerber bags, but the leak, rip easily, are not double zipped, and are more flimsy. Buy in bulk, as they are not reusuable, and you will go through them easily."
180982,1,This playmat is really awesome.My 3 month old baby likes it very much..He likes to play with the hanging toys...But I found some of those are hards like elephant and parrot..If that was made up of soft material then this play mat would be more great.....
155665,0,"I ordered this for my son who is potty training. It serves the purpose but I don't like that it doesn't convert to a toilet seat topper, I thought it did....wrong order. I will be ordering the other one for sure!"
10210,0,"We have been using this seat for about 6 months with our toddler boy. I love how it attaches to the seat easily and securely. Once it's on, it doesn't budge, but it removes easily. However, if our son sits down to pee, he gets pee all over the place. Even with him holding his private part down with his finger. The cheap ""bob the builder"" toilet seat does a better job of keeping the pee in the toilet while he is sitting. I wish they would make the seat more compatible with boys."
177213,0,The changing table has held up pretty well except we have to tighten the screws every month because it becomes a bit &quot;rickety&quot;. Still well worth the price.
123301,1,"This is ideal for a baby who is just learning to crawl. Because it is portable, it is convenient for our granddaughter's parents to bring it over to our house when we babysit. We did have trouble getting the outside cover on (it took two of us and a lot of effort), but it is fully portable without the cover, so we just leave it off.Be careful to follow the instructions for setting it up and taking it down. You may have to hold it upside down to get it to fully open and lock in place if it was taken down improperly."
11225,1,I just received my Pack N Play today. I was very pleased with the promptness of the delivery. It only took me about 30 mins to set up. It is a very nice size and color. I think my little guy will be very happy with his mommy's purchase. I have yet to use it as I am not due until May. So that is why I only gave it 4 stars.
65690,1,"These finger guards are perfect! What I love about them is not only that they work well - but also because they are easy to remove when you want to close the door. Soft and flexible, yet they do hold well and do not fall off. When I put my 3 year old to bed at night, I move it to the doorknob side of the door, leaving the door open just a couple of inches, and move it back to the other side in the morning. When I close the door, the thing actually will sit on top of the doorknob to remind me to put it back on.Drawback: The manufacturer's directions do state that if the door is forced shut, that it could damage your door. Because it's easier to fix/replace a door rather than fingers, I am okay with that and warned all family members about this so that they'd remember if they ever did feel themselves forcing the door shut. (It would be pretty hard to do.)"
103543,1,I bought this seat for my daughter when she was a year old b/c I was sick of having to hold her on my lap and have her stick her fingers in my food CONSTANTLY!I never have had a problem with it at all. I think that if you take the time to assemble it correctly and are using it correctly also it is WONDERFULL!!!The tray stays secure for me and my daughter who now is 2 and as wiggly as they come. Also I have no problems with it getting tight to the chair I am using. I lent it to a friend who used it at a picnic and she said it was able to go on a picnic table well with a few adjustments.I LOVE this chair and recommend it to anyone.
160145,1,this is the single besy piece of baby gear we own. my son sleeps like a....well....like a baby when he's wrapped up in his swaddle me. not sure how we lived without it ;)
182511,1,"next time i would get black, but it is wonderful"
152348,1,I was so tired of having stuffed animals all over my house. I'm so happy with my Boon animal bag. My kids love to sit on it and my daughter naps on it often. Would buy it again!
139569,2,"I got this for my baby shower, but my 2 year old son LOVES it!! I loved it also until I realized that I had to change the batteries every 3 nights! Batteries are expensive. My son asks for his stars every night, but I have to tell him that they are broken. I'm extremely disappointed and think it is horribly designed if it only lasts 3 nights, and that's even when it turns off automatically after 45 minutes, so it really only gets less than an hour and a half of working time before the batteries need to be changed."
91932,0,"Pros:-this pillow is shaped slightly more conveniently than a regular pillow, so it supports your pregnant body a bit better-this pillow is small enough that it isn't like having an additional person in the bed (helpful if you already sleep with a partner)-it does elevate your legs and help your hips into a more comfortable position during pregnancyCons:-it is a little bit thin and doesn't elevate the legs as much as I think would be helpful-it seems cheaply made (the seams of the slipcover started to come undone and the fabric pilled, the zipper stuck, and the pillow's stuffing got compacted and weird after only two or three months of use)Overall, having this pillow is better than using a regular pillow, but it's not radically better. If you're deciding on which pregnancy pillow to buy, I suggest looking further than this one (I can't recommend other brands because I haven't tried them; once I'd spent the money on this, I didn't want to spend even more). It seems a more substantial pillow might be a lot more effective."
91587,1,"I love this toy bag. This bag is great for holding all of my baby's favorite rattles and stuffed toys. It keeps everything within reach, so there is no more bending and digging to the bottom of the big toybox. It holds alot of toys. Before this bag we kept the same amount of toys in the nolonger used cradle (one layer completely covering the matress). When the toy bag is properly secured to the end of the crib my baby is still visible. The top of the bag is at about the same level as the top of the bumper pad (matress at highest level). The color of this bag is a medium yellow not too sunny or pastel. The white trim has a great texture and makes big beautiful bows."
24426,1,We bought one of these gates at a garage sale before our baby was due a couple of years ago. I didn't know anything about it and didn't even really know what we'd use it for. We LOVE this gate!!! So much that we just bought another one new. The vertical bars are great to keep kids (or dogs) from climbing over it. The step peddle is way too hard to push down for my son to manage (he's 28 months old) even if he tries - which he really doesn't. :) I frequently have hands full so the ease of opening without hands is hugely useful and appreciated. It's also easy to control and can be opened and closed very quietly if you have someone napping nearby. The only suggestion I'd make is to clean under it regularly if you have lots of animals and/or dirt in the house. I know that sounds funny but we have one in a doorway and when we shut the door it will push the foot pedal and move the gate a smidge each time. We also have a houseful of animals and dirt and I didn't think to take the gate out to clean under it regularly so the dirt from the motion of the gate wore away at the finish on the hardwood floor underneath. Not the gate's fault! Love these gates!
80713,1,"My daughter has sensitive skin and these training pants have been less irritating than other brands. She is also a heavy wetter at night and these have kept her dry most nights. I like that they do not have the tabs on the sides, as she tries to remove the tabs on other pull-ups and regular diapers."
180887,1,"My baby adore this gym since two month till now, he is now almost 8 month and still love it very muchIt encourages him to play,touch,kick,and watch the lights and also listen to the musicI recommend it to all mothers for sureEnjoooyyy"
53878,0,"The quality of the wooden table itself seems alright for the price, however be prepared to buy some additional screws. It is one thing to strip screws using a drill, but these stripped just using a screw driver. I had to buy a box of screws for the table portion as apparently the pre-drilled holes are too small and/or the metal on the screws is too soft. Had no problems with assembly of the chairs. Stain is definitely cherry per the description and not the walnut look shown on the picture."
88883,1,"This was a great option for diapers.It easy, quick, and they come right to your door!"
35569,1,"When I was at the stores, I kept seeing other mother's with this Floppy Seat. I knew instantly I had to purchase one for my son (now 7 months). I love the colors and the pockets for toys &amp; a drink. Now it does state in the packaging that it only requires one hand to unfold it from the bag position...that's totally impossible if you're alone. So I just unfold it before getting my son out of the vehicle and carry it in. Once he's in it, he loves it. I really like the fact that it protects him from the germs that may have been left behind by other children. I will definitely tell others about this product."
68762,0,"Hi there,Amazon is not only a book company....it sells everything from jewellery to computers, grocery and watever you can imagine in the past 8 to 10 years...there's nothing snappy about it...."
34449,2,"We purchased the most expensive video monitor thinking that we would ""get what we paid for."" I certainly hope there are better ones on the market. The sound on this monitor is not clear, there is a constant electronic-type hum. Pretty annoying when you're trying to catch some much-needed sleep! Also, while advertised as a color monitor, beware that the color is very ""washed out"" (reds look pale pink)and not significantly different from a black & white video monitor, even after adjusting the brightness. Additionally, the rechargeable batteries run down rather quickly (3-3.5 hours).Having said that, it IS wonderful to be able to ""peek"" at the baby without waking him/her. A video monitor is the way to go, but perhaps there is a better one out there."
180907,0,"This tummy time mat is decent. It provides lots of stimulation and activities to keep a baby busy. My only issue with it is that my two arches don't stay together and I fear that it will collapse on my niece. I'm going to try super gluing these together but that will defeat the easy collapse it does. Overall, good but you can find a better built one with just as many colors, sounds and stimulation as this one."
63319,1,I think this product is great!! i have many play mats and this is by far the best!!! The water shifts around which makes your child lift up more!!! I my just loves this mat!
168181,1,I have used swaddlers for both my boys and they have not disappointed me. They don't leak and they are very soft and allow my kids to move freely. Other brands I have tried have an awkward fit or I wast diapers because I thought they were wet when they were not. I love Pampers brand!!!!!
102184,1,"I sent this to my cousin, who lives 700 miles away. She loved it. She informed me that she already uses it for her 2 year old and had planned to use it for the baby. She said that it puts her daughter right to sleep and that her daughter loved carrying the tote bag around. She had made it into a make shift purse and was putting all her toys in it. My cousin and her daughter both have sensitive skin, but have no problems with this product. Its a great product for all ages!"
158885,1,These bottles were given to me as a gift. They are great. My 3 month old loves the nipples. She never really liked the wide ones. The only thing is that its a hassle to clean but worth it if you want your baby to have less gas.
41136,2,This used to be a good deal for buying Cruisers (especially with the free shipping over $25). But now the price has jumped from $7.49 to $10.49 overnight. It is much cheaper to buy diapers at a local store.
94985,1,This pump was very efficient and worked better than I expected. I would only suggest to purchase it if you are only going to pump occassionally and not on a daily basis. Because I had issues with Breastfeeding I had to upgrade to the double pump version but overall I was impressed with this pump.
184191,0,"**You must have removable headrests to use this item!!**I got this thinking it would make the back of my Durango so much roomier. I figured I could hang this from the back of the seats and the stroller would be contained. What I didn't count on was the space between the gate opening and the ""contained stroller"". This product is great perfect and wonderful, if the seats that stroller are suspended from are not 4 feet from your back gate. If you have a drop down back seat with REMOVABLE HEADRESTS in your car, or a minivan, this item is perfect. If you have more than 1 foot of space between the back gate and the back seat, this will be a trial."
54527,2,We received this mobile as a gift for our daughter and the motor that turns the blue ball at the top makes a loud churning noise when used. It's very distracting and almost as loud as the music. We will be returning the mobile. Sorry to be so negative but it's not what we expected.
89936,2,"These diapers are dangerous and should be on recall. Pampers should be sued and put out of business. I was so surprised to find out that the extreme rash problem with my twin girls (yeah both of them) was caused by these diapers. I say this because since birth I have used Pampers and up until my daughters started using size 4 there was no diaper rash let alone this severe.I am disgusted that I failed to recognized the source of the problem earlier, but that just goes to tell you how much faith in the Pamper name we as parents had. I have no idea what is the difference between size 4 and the lower sizes, but I will NEVER buy a Pamper product again.My girls had such extreme diaper rash that they bled. We kept on blaming it on the heat and the baby wipes and even the diaper rash cream. We must have 10 different types of diaper rash cream in the house.Believe me when I say that in this size (size 4) the diaper is different, they did something, added/switched/deducted some ingredient.I don't know if the reviews for this diaper that received 5 stars are reviewing the size 4 or other sizes but they should allow this particular size to be reviewed by itself.Read all the one star review, almost everyone had the same problem. Over 100 reviews regarding diaper rash.Don't let the low price allow you to buy this dangerous product. I will be contacting Pampers directly as well as Amazon to inform them about this problem, in which I'm sure they both already know about, because I've seen reviews of Pamper representatives.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
143878,1,"I like this product, I like that it's clear plastic...I figure my son is looking right at it and if I were him I wouldn't want it to be plain black. I also didn't want anything with pockets to hold his stuff...if he can't reach it I thought that would just be like torture! If I needed another one I would buy it. However, it does not lay flat like it shows in the picture...maybe it's just my car seat? The top right and left corners I had to fold in behind the plastic, which doesn't really bother me I guess. The elastic on the bottom is a bit visible in my front seat, again not a problem. And the top part has 2 sets of ties to tie around your head rest posts."
62727,2,"When I twist the top to seal the bag after a diaper, the cutting blade snags on the bag, making sealing the diaper really difficult. Even worse, when I DO try to cut the bag, the blade does a half-hearted job, so I have to finish the job with scissors.This has been such a problem that now that we're out of refills, we're just going to get a different diaper pail."
61597,0,"The clarity of this monitor is fantastic but the down side is that the battery runs out waaaay too quickly. I had this monitor for a little less than a month now and I have to change the batteries every couple of days. Since Dec 31,2010 until now Jan 23, 2011 I have changed the batteries atleast 5times. Anywhere from 1-3days after changing batteries the ""low battery"" light comes on & I am posative it is not my batteries. I bought them brand new the same time I purchased this monitor. Other than that major issue it would be a great monitor. There is no static or other outside noise. All you hear is what you want & need to hear, your baby. You decide for youself."
166214,1,We've tried every other kind of diaper and pampers are the only thing that keep the mess in check. Now that I can get them through Amazon for less then store brand diapers I'll never use anything else! sign up for Amazon Mom AND the subscribe and save program. it saves so much money and its super convenient.
56540,2,"worked for my first born, however when we purchased new ones for my second son he quickly figured them out. curious boy that he is quickly discovered how to open and close them and pull them off."
20541,1,"The Fisher Price Jumperoo- I think this may be the BEST invention for infant entertainment ever! We all remember the doorway jumpers- cool idea, but kinda scary... I mean is it possible for the kid to get a running start and sling-shot himself across the room? Or worse that the whole contraption just fall off of the doorway?!!?I first saw the Fisher Price Jumperoo about 5 years ago when we lived in Texas. My friend Rachel's family was visiting her and they brought along their Jumperoo for baby Maddox. I thought it was the coolest thing ever! So of course, when we registered for our baby shower 3 years later, I made positively sure the Jumperoo was on the registry!Boy am I glad that I did! This was literally my little one's favorite infant toy, hands down! We started the Little Princess Pea in the Jumperoo at around 4 1/2 months or so. She was able to hold her head up and have control of her upper body, although we did add some rolled up baby blankets for extra support in the front.The Jumperoo has 3 different height settings so that it can be adjusted as your baby grows. Ours also came with a toy tray that had several different colorful toys on it. The middle toys was musical and had lights. You could set the toy to play continuously or play when the baby jumped.When we first started LPP in the Jumperoo, she could touch the floor with her tippy toes.... but enough so that she could get some sway to the jumper. She absolutely hated the swing that we shelled out $150 for, but the bounce of the jumperoo totally soothed her. As she got older, taller, and more in control of her reflexes, she bounced her heart out! Her favorite place to be while I cooked dinner was hanging out in the jumperoo.Also, it folds flat, so we took it on trips with us as well. She loved for people to watch her jump- she would get so excited that she'd just jump and laugh her little self silly! I feel like it really help to develop her leg muscles, and because you are basically hanging in a little seat, give her confidence in her ability to hold herself up. She was holding herself up on the furniture long before she started crawling.We loved the Fisher Price Jumperoo as did our little one. I recommend it to all of my friends who are expecting! This item is definitely a must-have!"
95604,1,I needed a place for my child's stuffed animals and the toy hammock was perfect. It was easy to install and it is holding up about 10 HUGE stuffed animals and a lot of small ones too right above the bed. I picked this one over the others since it was a larger net. Great buy for the money!
45011,0,"I have a 3 month old daughter and she loves this play gym. As a parent I do have a few complaints, but nothing that I consider a deal-breaker. I wish there were lights on the arches, not just on the mat itself. I've also had problems with the ""nursery tunes"" musical setting. I can't get it to play longer than 30 seconds or so. I don't have that problem with the ""Mozart"" setting for some reason. Regardless, she loves it."
44173,2,"We don't have a shower diverter pull on our faucet, so this faucet cover often falls off. Additionally, it has so many crevices that just turns orange with mold and is impossible to clean. It pretty much has to be soaked and then cleaned with a Qtip and there are still parts that don't get cleaned. Love other Boon products, but I'd pass on this one. Actually in the market for a new faucet cover."
16721,2,"If this toy was like $5 it would not have been so bad... my son was not paying it any attention....I returned it immediately & got him a baby tad, which he loves!"
19099,0,Its nice and continent but i felt like i never used it right and it was awkward sometimes. I wish i had the other type of sling even though it takes more time to put on
109842,1,"I received it in time. Works great, it is quite long compared with similar products. It is sturdy, very happy with product."
123895,2,"We ordered this seat online because it wasn't available at stores in our area. We received the seat today and I was not impressed at all. The seatbelt guides are attached to the fabric, not the actual seat and seem flimsy to me. Also, the padding for the seat is quite minimal- I couldn't imagine having to sit in it for more than a few minutes. The hard plastic is easily felt through the cover. I like the look of this seat, but in this case looks were deceiving. We will be returning this one for one that looks a little more sturdy."
179186,1,"Keeps gas at a minimum and are easy to prep. I like how they fit perfectly in my nephews mouth and the crook of my arm as he is feeding. The only drawback I experienced is that with so many parts to clean (it breaks down to five parts), clean up can be cumbersome."
141046,2,"I had high hopes for this food mill and researched it carefully before purchasing. However, it has far under performed relative to expectations. The mill is chintzy (predominantly plastic with a small, dull stainless steel bar that passes for the blade). The space where you would put the food is tiny (about 1/4 cup), it's difficult to attach the grinding apparatus to the bowl, it tips over easily and overall is messy. I can only use it to grind very soft items for my baby. I am very disappointed."
47836,1,This gate is wonderful. I loved that my son would still be able to see me through the gate as though it wasn't there. The only thing I was a little dissapointed about was the fact that you need to have a relatively large door in order for the gate to be able to swing open and walk through.
149119,2,"I only had the Back n Belly pillow for one month when the pillow wasn't full any more, thus not providing the support that it did when I first bought it. I contacted Leachco and they told me they couldn't replace it, you had to bring it back to the place you bought it. I bought my pillow online at Target, so I would have to pay for shipping charges again if I wanted to try another pillow. Leachco has terrible customer service, the worst I have ever experience.Save your money and buy from a different company, their products are over-price and aren't made well!"
31305,1,I got this as a gift and I love it! It is perfect for any kitchen with some extra space! Great because I mix and match 4-8 oz bottles with my infant! I recommend it!
39928,1,"This is a great little machine. Sure an iphone or other radio could do the job but, sometimes it's nice to have a dedicated device that does one thing and does it well. The only complaint I have (which is small actually) is that I do wish it would continue playing the same sound after a power outage. At it is, it defaults to the first sound when the power returns."
136681,1,"I recommended this to everyone that I knew who had a baby or was expecting. I recieved this for my baby shower, not even realizing that I would be needing any crib toys before my baby was born, but now that he is here, I am so happy that we have it! Since my son was born, he has been soothed by the lullabies and the story-telling. The first few weeks we used the light from this to peek in on our baby boy. Now, he is 2 1/2 months, and when he gets fussy at night, I turn the music on without the lights (so as not to waste batteries), and he goes right back to sleep. He is now familiar with the music and knows that when it is on, he goes to sleep. It's a great crib toy. Also, just today, I bought the Ocean Wonders Aquarium just for an alternate toy for him to look at, we'll see how that goes. Overall, the Dreamscapes Soother is a great investment, just stock up on those C batteries!"
33000,1,This product works really well for our Britax advocate cs 70 car seat. We had a hard time using towels because when ever my husband sat down on the seat to tighten the latch straps the towels compressed too much throwing the angle off. This product has a great shape and doesn't compress like the towels. I think it's ridiculous that this product needs to exist but I'm glad that it does. We used a simple kitchen knife to trim the length so it could fit perfectly. Easy Peasy!
146486,1,"My niece is 5 months old and we noticed that everytime we had her standing up she would jump and jump so we got this for her and she loves it! she jumps so much and she laughs she enjoys all the little toys and sounds it has, and it helps her to grow strong legs and also to sleep better cause she gets tired from all the physical activity I guess. This is great, if your baby starts to jump, get this for them, you'll be amazed."
99281,1,"Amazon is the best place to shop. The price is reasonable and because of the count, it last long. Overall, it is a good buy."
149261,1,"Prior to buying this pillow I had been sleeping on my left side and wedging a pillow between my knees, which helped ease my back some. I wasn't sure if I really ""needed"" a pregnancy pillow and felt a little silly paying so much for the pillow and shipping. However, I'm so glad I did -- this has been the best purchase I have made during my pregnancy. I previously woke up 3 times a night to use the restroom. Now I am much more comfortable and only wake up once a night.I also have had asthma trouble during my pregnancy and bruised a rib from coughing, which has made laying down very painful. This pillow has been such a life saver. It's the only way I'm truly comfortable laying down!If you are looking for a pregnancy pillow, definitely buy this one. It's well worth the price and the shipping cost.While the pillow is large, that's the beauty of it! It cradles you from all sides. My husband and I are still able to sleep comfortably in our queen bed although it's definitely more cozy than it was previously."
168713,1,"I purchased this product togive at a baby shower and the price was incredible compared to he retail stores , perfect place to shop with Amazon"
102774,2,"My husband and I bought this because, as new parents, we wanted to save money on baby equipment. As many of the other reviews have stated, the low price and the fact that you can use regular trash bags in this is a big draw. Please, do not get sucked into getting this pail. In fact, if you really want to save money, don't get a diaper pail at all. Manufacturers of baby products make you think you need diaper pails, just as they make you think you need changing tables and diaper wipe warmers! Use a plain plastic grocery bag, hang it on the door knob to your baby's room, and put diapers in it. When it gets full(or too stinky!), simply take it to the big garbage can outside. This diaper pail made my son's room smell horrible. As soon as I went to go upstairs, I could smell the stink coming from his room. I sprayed the pail with Lysol almost every day and washed it in hot, soapy water weekly, and it still didn't help. Save your money!!"
58125,0,"The walker is really only effective on carpet. If you have wooden floors, you may want to look into another option. The walker simply slides on wooden floors since the plastic wheels offer no grip. Our twin sons do play with it and it mostly ends up turned upside down for them to bang on the flat side."
36443,0,"My daughter is just 41 pounds and for some reason, even when I use the seatbelt clip, the seatbelt does NOT sit flat against her shoulder in my odyssey. When she sits in my husband's FJ Cruister, in the middle seat, it does. I'm going to put it away for a few more years. I have already gotten the Graco high back and it is much better. Better support, and she can fall asleep still with the high back. I think I jumped too soon with the backless! It's ok, it was cheap enough!"
181096,1,"I bought this gym and one other for my grandson. He is 11 months old and still loves to play with this toy. Well made with many features to keep baby's attention. The crossbars are high enough for baby to grow, unlike the other play gym we purchased. It's very sturdy and has places to add other toys. I purchased additional links to lengthen and add toys. Once he was up crawling we took the toys off for him to continue playing with. Out of all of his toys, this was our best buy"
75695,0,"This is very pretty and goes very well with the Sugar Plum set. My daughter actually really loves to watch the butterflies turn round and round and likes the music to it. I wish the music and mobile lasted longer, however. All in all, not a bad product, but I think we might opt for one of those mobiles with a remote to get a little longer play and put this one on the changing table for short term entertainment."
122393,1,my son just loved his new room. It feels like you can reach up and touch the stars.
34593,1,Easy to use. Just press the button to flip center cap to drop the diaper inside. Easy to remove the dirty diapers bag and reload a new bag. Pretty much odor free. You can keep anti-odor pieces inside the center cap. It uses tall kitchen bags which means very minimal ongoing cost. Quality product at great price. I recommend it.
64578,1,"This gate is EXCELLENT for small dogs AND for 1 year old babies. I have bought two now, and both have only had one problem each. The first was my daughter's fault, she tried to jump over it and broke the bracket that holds the wood sliding together. So it's not THE MOST rugged gate. The second gate just recently broke at the wooden dowel that swings the door open... looks like the dowel is just too short to keep it in place. We never use the little door, so I just lashed it in place and it all works fine. I'd still buy another if I needed one!"
106803,1,"I hate the Diaper Genie so I was excited to try this Diaper Champ out and I have to say I love it. I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they're nuts! (no offense)My son is now 5 1/2 months old and is nursing but also eats most solids including table foods when were out at a restaurant. His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ.Usually we change the bag about once a week, every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week. I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me. They've got to be doing something wrong.Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned...if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do, and you get poop on the pail, it does need to be wiped off. A good wiping out with some antibacterial wipe, every week or two doesn't hurt either."
73702,1,"This is my favorite purchase made for our new baby. It makes it so easy to time feedings/diaper changes when you are sleep deprived. My husband can use it while I am napping and I will know how long ago the baby was fed, etc. I was on painkillers after delivery and I found it very helpful to use this item to know when to take my next dose. The light on the timer is awesome for midnight feedings when you need to see something without having to light up the whole room."
113874,1,"Simple basic booster, we use it instead of a full size highchair because of a small dining area. Is works great with our baby eating at the table with us. Best part is with no soft surfaces and mostly smooth surfaces it is EASY to clean. Excellent buy for the price."
138960,0,Need to be in a very dark room to see the lights but my daughter enjoys it so I guess its ok.
81397,1,"I am so pleased with this stroller. This is the first one that I have bought and it beats out the ones that were handed down to me. It's the perfect size, light, and navigates around smoothly. My 15 month old loves sitting in it, no fuss! Also, the colors are neutral since I am expecting my second child. Great price, great product!"
116560,1,The product is eactly what was needed and ordering it from Amazon was both easy and quick. It was received in perfect condition in a very timely manner. The perfect item for a new born in Vermont.
121743,1,This is really great. I used it for feeding my baby when he was very little. now he uses it to sit up - it gives him that extra support that he needs to sit.My whole family likes to use it to snuggle on the coach it gives support to the neck or back etc.
85411,1,I am just over 19 weeks and finally the tossing and turning through the night is over! I may have to keep this in the bed even after after our Spring arrival :) If you are doing a ton of research and want to know which pregnancy pillow to buy stop looking and buy it...this is the one!!!
76205,1,I own 8 of these trays and love them. I make 100% of my baby's food and couldn't do it without these trays. They're awesome and have stood up to countless washings. I recommend them to all my baby food making friends. They're also good for freezing breast milk cubes - which I use in a mesh feeder for my son when he's teething.
42037,1,"I am a brand new mommy and we have used this over ten times already with our 3 1/2 week old boy... We just snug him in with blankets... I LOVE that I can see him (facing me) incase of puke or something... I also love that when he is older we can turn it around... It lies pretty flat too so he is comfortable!My husband and I did TONS of research on strollers and found this one to really be exactly what we were looking for (for the price).... We wanted something we could travel with and use right away (as I was eager to get out of the house shortly after we had him).It is easy to use - simple on and off, simple open and close.... just simple. It all fits together nicely too - quality parts and assembly - I love Britax...It isn't too heavy - I'm 120 (pre-pregnancy) and 5'4"" and it is fine for me to carry around...Great stroller - highly recommended!"
110338,0,"The chair is well built and made from solid woods. However, there is no recline on this model and the ottoman is quite low. It is OK but not very comfortable. I would rather pay more money for a better chair in retrospect."
57101,1,"I was a little hesitant on this gate because not all the reviews were positive. But I have this blocking my little one and my dogs from the kitchen. I love that with a little extra push the door will stay open when I need the door open for constant in and out. But I can also just open it a little and walk thru and it shuts right away keeping the crew from following me into the kitchen. It does take a little extra effort to open the door but I like that because my very curious, smart toddler might figure out how to operate but not have the strength to do so. It was super simple to install and hasn't budged from where I put and We have a lot of foot traffic in and out of the kitchen. I highly recommend this gate to anyone in need of keeping kids or dogs contained."
175095,1,"This tub is perfect! It has grippies (whatever they are really called, it doesnt matter) on the bottom of the tub to help hold baby in place, and you can attempt to tilt baby's head back on the tail of the duck to rinse her hair (good luck, my daughter doesnt let me do that much but the option is still there :D )No, the tub doesnt fit under my faucet but all I have to do is turn on the shower and fill the tub that way. No problem whatsoever.The HOT temperature gauge is a nice touch, however I go by my own opinion of what is an acceptable temp for my daughter.Overall, the tub is great! It's a terrific buy and I recommend it to everyone!"
149770,1,"This is a terrific product. (Super)lightweight and easy to install. We cannot wait for our second child to grow into her own, because we'll gladly buy a second. One drawback is that it seems when my son falls asleep in it, he can tend to slump forward or awkwardly to the side and we have to make certain this means he doesn't slip his shoulder out from the topside of the seatbelt, so monitoring and performing minor adjustments in the back length of the seat are important to a good and safe fit of the seat to the child."
126926,1,"We used Pampers on our kids when they were newborns, but always switch over to Huggies. Once they are out of the stage 1 diapers. They don't leak as much as Pampers do. Even though they don't feel as soft as a pampers diaper, I still prefer Huggies. I feel like the slightest amount of pee in a Pampers diaper and it feels soaked and weighs a ton. Huggies it is for our house!"
19039,2,"The description says ""slipcover zips off for easy cleaning"", but the product did not come with a slipcover. The pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern. Now I have to find a slipcover that won't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath."
163451,0,"I registered for this and received it at my baby shower. While the concept is good, it doesn't do much to save space. With the arms of it at the height they are, it prevents me from pushing the chair under the table, so it just sits in the middle of the floor. Also because of that, I will not be able to use it as a booster seat. I saved more space by getting a regular high chair because the tray is just above the table and can easily push it in. Also, I have found the tray to not only be flimsy, but the one handed feature rarely works and the tray is very small. A LOT of food landed on the floor when my daughter was in it."
24667,1,"I wish I had gotten this gate long ago! While I'm currently pregnant with our first child, we also have a dog that has required the use of gates and this could have saved us a lot of aggravation over those years. It installs so easily (especially considering we live in an older house with out of square and irregularly sized doorways) and stays put. The door pedal is accessible from both sides and the gate door also swings either way, making entry and exit from the same room super easy. The opening isn't very wide, but our doorways aren't very wide in this house to begin with and it's certainly wide enough to go through without any major adjustments, so it doesn't really seem like a drawback to me."
79901,1,I use these with the 12 oz Klean Kanteen bottles for my sons - this protects their skin from getting too cold.
56553,1,"I have these stove covers for our gas stove and felt very safe having them when our daughter was growing up. They were easy to operate, clean and have not broken. I bought them again for my sister in law who is starting a family. They were hard to find, glad I found them on Amazon."
85036,0,"Make sure to look at the size! 14"" by 14"". It's super soft and perfect otherwise. I just needed it to be bigger."
78098,2,Impossible to clean. DOES NOT COME WITH SECOND COVER. You cant remove the straps to clean them so they become filthy. Adjusting the straps to higher on the shoulders is impossible because you cant get into that part of the chair. This is a horrible highchair. Dont be fooled by the cute fabric.
17490,1,"Very comfortable, user-friendly, top tray pops off easily for washing, nice design, cushiony padding, safe straps... Any of the Trend highchairs are a good buy! I used the Simplicity Plus for 12 months and threw it away (read my review on the Simplicity Plus). I should have bought this highchair from the beginning. I bought the Palm Tree print for our home and Tahoe for Grandma's house."
92826,1,"My 4 1/2 month old granddaughter really loves this - she is not able to sit up by herself, but the seat is deep enough to hold her upright with no problem---the only issue I had with it is the width of the seat bottom that comes up between her legs - it is so wide that I had to bunch it together after I put her in it, so that her legs would hang evenly - she can only touch the bottom of the floor with the tips of her toes (and I have it on the lowest setting) but she can still bounce - she is fascinated with all the toys - there are so many interesting things on this gym to keep her entranced. It was also very easy to put together - the directions can get a little fuzzy, but common sense prevails. It is well worth the money for the enjoyment she is having and also it will last her for quite some time. Alot safer to me than the johnny jump-ups that hang from the doorways."
20542,1,"I bought the Jumperoo for my 4 months old son after seeing a friend's son just giggle and laugh in it. I couldn't wait to see my son's reaction in this toy. It took him a while to get the hang of it but then he was off jumping to his heart's content. The music and sound is motion activated as he jumps. The height is adjustable as the baby grows. This toy lasted until my son was about 9 months old when he learned to crawl and didn't want to be confined to a jumper. But before then, it was a nice way to get your hands free while he wears himself out jumping up and down. The jumper folds up which makes storage convenient. I'm saving it for my next baby because I'm sure he/she will love it too!"
163004,0,"I ordered these refills and did not realize that there are 2 different sizes of refills. I only noticed this one when I was looking. They had no picture of the box shown so couldn't compare it to the ones I already had. I ended up with the wrong size after very slow shipping. Granted it was free, but it took 13 days for me to receive them. The return was easy, and they paid for the return shipping too. I did reorder the Diaper Dekor PLUS refills hoping those are the right ones. You can also get a $5 first time order discount through diapers.com."
179445,1,"I have the newest version of the gogokidz travelmate, and it now has a quick release strap along with quick release wheels. So, there are NO screws to deal with (except when you first set it up - but those screws become a permanent attachment on the product).The handle also goes from very short to VERY long - nobody should have a problem getting the handle to a comfortable position. The handle also locks into place at all levels, so the handle does NOT slip out when you don't want it to.The company did a great job of listening to customers and making improvements. Great buy and very easy to use.The easiest thing is to have security check it with a wand, BUT if you need/want to put your carseat on the security belt, you can easily detach the wheels and/or just undo the quick release strap and take the carseat off of the gogokidz altogether.This will fit down most airplane aisles, BUT some car seats are too big, so you may have to carry the car seat - but using the gogokidz, you now at least have a handle with which to lift the seat. Safe Travels!"
46394,0,"Our grandson is 17 months old and is climbing out of his playpen and crib and running all over the place. My husband and I babysit for him and he wears us out. We bought this playard to safely contain him. At first he loved playing in it, but not long after he is climbing out of it too. He plays in it for a while, which is nice because it gives us partial relief. We really like it a lot, but wish it was made different so he could not climb out of it! On the whole though, we love it even for partial relief!"
13077,1,"I bough this when I bought the Britax Marathon cars seat. The mighty-tite is a lifesaver. The car seat goes in and out of two cars almost daily. It is very easy to operate. Just be careful not to over tighten, if you do then it is very hard to get to the yellow lever."
63610,0,"We purchased these for our 2-year-old for our trip to Europe. They are pretty large and bulky to bring in carry on luggage, considering how limited carry on space is these days. For plane flights I should have purchased something inflatable - these are better for car trips when you have more room. Our son didn't want us to set them up before he fell asleep, so we had to sneak them in after he dozed off. They definitely help with head slumping and seemed to make it more comfortable for him to sleep in his car seat. There is a strap connecting the two pillows together, and I wish it were removable so that you could use just one pillow at a time if you wanted. With our son's car seat (a Britax) there wasn't enough room to use both pillows at once. The product seemed well made, it just didn't work great for our needs."
80279,1,"THis is a wonderful car seat. It is solid, high quality, easy to get baby in and out of and most importantly feels very safe and secure. Nice 5 point harness belts, no twisting and easy to snap. Cute design. Definitely believe my baby will out grow this seat before it wears out or breaks. Only word of caution, this is a BIG car seat. I drive a full size sedan and don't believe this would fit well in a car any smaller."
163223,1,"we initially got this because it seemed nicer than a diaper bag, to carry when the baby was with her father, but we ended up only using this and not the diaper bag at all. We have had two so far, one for each baby. neat, clean and small, you can use it anywhere."
121363,1,"This walker is great and my son loves it.. he can maneuver around in it very easily.. and the tray is great for letting him snack on cheereos. The only reason I took a star away is because getting the seat and seat cushion in and out in order to wash is a pain. It is so hard getting the straps inside and under the seat and reattached.. last time I broke a nail! Other than that, it's a great walker!"
155679,1,"We don't go anywhere without it.It was worth every penny. Now, if only my toddler used it ALL the time..."
2655,1,"Pampers baby dry is great! My husband and I absolutely love it. It's very absorbant. Once we forgort to change the diager for our son, though the diaper is very heavy, it's not leaky at all. I think we will stick with pampers baby dry."
11926,1,"Emma LOVES trying new foods, so at dinner, we give her some of whatever we are eating... I think it will help her to not be a picky eater in the future. We went and bought a second one so that she could have two different foods at a time. (last night it was chicken and green beans) I find that it is not that hard to clean if I stick it in a bowl of water right after she is done, and then every night I put the bowl and the feeders in the dishwasher. I haven't had problems cleaning it since I started doing that."
43175,1,"I love all of those lightweight toddler strollers that you can just fold up quick and throw in the trunk. Until I discovered this product, I thought it only applied to strollers for toddlers and young children. You can take a baby that is sleeping in the car and effortlessly transfer them to the stroller WITHOUT WAKING THEM UP! I see so many women with the large toddler stroller with the car seat balanced precariously on top. It just never looked right to me. I also believe it ""locks you in"" to buying a more substantial (and expensive) stroller from one manufacturer. I would rather own two less expensive and significantly less bulky strollers that are easy to lift, easy to maneuver through crowded stores, and are just as comfy. I also considered some of the other ones available before I found this one that is MADE to go with the Graco car seat that I already own. Genious!"
12603,1,"Have had the Snap and Go double stroller for a month now and it has performed quite well. I had to read the instructions to understand how my type of car seat fit the stroller, but once I did that and changed the adjustable bars, it fit perfectly. I have not found it difficult to get around and up hills. Not meant for a jogging stroller, but excellent, compact option otherwise."
91566,0,"This product is well-made, but my daughter's head still doesn't stay supported when she naps. I am thinking it may work better when she is older and bigger and sits in a front-facing carseat."
82557,1,"My son loves this seat and we love how sturdy it is! I was afraid that the side impact protection wings would obscure his view, but it doesn't at all. Our favorite features - you can recline the seat without having to uninstall it, you don't have to rethread the hardness straps, it's narrow enough to have right next to another car seat, & his head doesn't slump when he falls asleep, even when it's not reclined. The recline knobs are rather hard to turn, but that's the only even remotely negative thing I can say. He keeps saying, ""Mommy, I love my new car seat!"""
154346,2,"My favorite wipes were out of stock, so I took a gamble and purchased these. They are awful and I wish I hadn't purchased so many of them. They are very small and also have a terrible scent. Fragrance free does not equal unscented! The texture of them reminds me of pampers wipes except they aren't as ""wet"" feeling, so if you like pampers wipes you may like these."
146889,0,"I love having this mat down for my 5 month old to roll around on. The only problem is when it comes to cleaning it you can't just sweep it off. You have to take each piece (circle, outer ring & connectors) and clean them separately with a rag to get all the dust and hair off of them. And it does take some time to assemble the mat so it's not like you can just pick it up and put it back down when you need to."
117470,1,"My 6 1/2 month old son loves this! It took him a couple of days to figure out how to jump in it but now he's going like a yoyo.I gave this 4 stars because it's fairly hard to ajust the hight because we have low door frames.Also i believe this product says birth and up...I would NEVER put a baby in this until they can sit supported and have good balance when ""stood"" on your lap so i'd say 6-11 months old maybe defently not for walking babies.That said if your baby is ready for one get it.They have a blast and saves your arms from acheing from bouncing them on your lap :)"
58278,1,"Not only can one keep shoes in them but my son figured out that in the empty pockets he can also keep crayons, Happy Meal toys and other toddler treasures. The adjustable tie cord makes it easy to raise or lower the organizer to suit the hight of the child, and the bright multiple colors brighten the room. If I needed another one or need to replace this one for some reason I would not have a problem buying another one."
23609,0,"I teach a cradle roll class at church, and we have two of these. The kids absolutely love them. Some of the parents have gone out and gotten the same chair for using at home. These chairs seem more sturdy than the other three that we have in the classroom, and they are much easier to get the bigger kids in and out of. They are great for the younger kids because there are two leg openings, instead of relying solely on the belt to prevent a kid from sliding out. We haven't really had problems with kids getting out of them, as long as their feet couldn't touch the floor (we have a very low table), however they are in a semi-circle, facing me, so we keep a close eye on them.There are a few drawbacks to these chairs, though. The material isn't all that easy to wipe off, meaning we have to take the covers home and wash them, opposed to the plastic ones we just wipe down. The seats sit back from the table a ways, meaning the kids often drop things between the table and their seat. Also, on one of the seats, the release mechanism doesn't release anymore, so it is nearly impossible to move the seat if the table has any kind of ledge on the underside."
153714,1,Simple to use and provided excellent sun protection. We have used it on 3 different strollers and it worked simply and easily on all three of them.
85961,1,I purchased this monitor after being incredibly disappointed with the Safety 1st Color Monitor. This monitor works very well and is more reasonably priced.
15447,2,"I had bought this at Walmart for my son. I put the chair together properly, although i do not believe the holes were appropriate for the screws. My son was able to tip the chair over and he got hurt. It did not take much movement for that to happen. The safety of my child is the most important thing as I am sure it is for all parents so please reconsider if you are aiming to buy this product."
56292,1,i have last year's model and altho i love the stroller in every other way my feet occasionally kick the wheels and on a long walk i unconsciously compensate so by the end i look like i shd be swinging from a bell tower. I love the one hand close/open and it will take a lot of punishment (we used it on steep rocky mountain trails in a state forest) but unless u walk like a fashion model you will from time to time be kicking the back wheels.
180412,1,This is a really cute diaper bag. My husband loves it and there's plenty of compartments for storage. My only complaint is that it's a little small for the price.
101297,2,"I just love Pampers Swaddlers and I've used them for both babies. But these Pampers Baby-Dry sz 3 are just worthless! Every little wee-wee just balloons the diaper and subsequent wee-wees leak out. Diaper gets ""full"" way too easily, then when we pick her up and hold her it squishes out (number 1 squeezes out and wets all of our clothes). Just no good. Hubby doesn't get upset at much, but he is just hugely frustrated about these. We're going through 3x as many diapers, at least, as we did when using Huggies. So back to Huggies it is."
163085,1,"There is nothing special about this diaper pail. It doesnt control odor any more than what I used before. But it's easy to use--bags are easy to change and the lid opens readily. As small as it is, the dirty diapers are changed frequently to minimize odor. It's a decent diaper pail for the price and have no regrets. I'm glad I made the purchase."
89531,1,"Pampers are the best diapers! I will never buy any other diapers. My baby stays dry, she rarely wets through. Any other diapers she immediately soaks through to her clothes. Love the pampers!"
8043,2,"Despite other review's description regarding the overwhelming scent of these wipes I decided to try them out - whoa. I was not expecting it to be a strong old-lady perfume. Plus the dispenser (on all 4 packs we tried) barely worked, after 2 or 3 wipes we had to digging into the funk to pull out the next wipe. Also of note, these wipes are not as moist as others we've tried."
113522,1,"[...]Above is a link to my review on youtube for this booster seat. After 8 months of use, these are my positives and negatives:Positives: small, easy to clean, saves space and is out of view, safe, easy to put baby in and out, and its great for traveling.Negatives: my son sometimes pulls off the top, washable part of the tray and if there is food on it, it will go everywhere.For the price it's a great deal!"
67832,1,Baby is snug by our bed and it doesn't take up much space. It's perfect and snaps together. I am buying it for my friends who are having babies!
74294,1,"This portable bassinet has absolutely been the best ""gadget"" that we have bought for our little girl. The Pogy fits into a compact carrying bag that is smaller than our diaper bag but it pops open to a bassinet with more than enough room for our 5 month old. I figure it will fit her for at least 6 more months. I have told all my family that each of them will get one of these next time they have a baby shower. Everyone who sees it wants to know where to get one. We've taken it on cross country trips, trips to see the grandparent's, to church, to the park, and more. Its SO much more practical than our pack and play. In fact since we bought this, we have not even used the pack and play! If you are a parent who can't afford to always be home during nap time, then BUY THIS TODAY!"
17035,0,I was disappointed with my purchase of this monitor. No where on the box did it give a range. On inside paperwork it stated that you will loose quality in sound and/or picture if you go beyond 60ft. I had to be 66 feet. I could see the picture pretty well but never could hear any sound - only static. Keep this in mind if you purchase this product.
78468,1,"I needed a tall gate to keep my high-jumping, rescue dog confined to the kitchen during his housebreaking. This gate, although a bit pricey, fits the bill perfectly! It was very easy to install and simple to use. It does not require any permanent attachment to walls or woodwork, and once installed, the frame stays in place. No more having to constantly undo and redo the tension bar to get in or out of a room, or risking your life trying to step over it! If you need something tall, this is definitely the way to go."
33417,1,need this gate for dogs when we were painting rooms and it is a vary strong gate just love it .......
25301,1,"I bought this about 10 months ago and it's still holding up great! My two year old (soon to be 3) always has her feet on the back of the seat. This works great to keep her dirty shoes off of my tan leather seats. It's black, which is nice, because even though it may be dirty, you can't see it and when you can, just wipe it clean with a damp cloth and it's as good as new. I like the handy storage pouch on it as well, perfect for a travel size of wipes to wipe dirty hands, etc. I bought two of these after reading some reviews of them not holding up too well, but it's still in the box! I would recommend this to anyone."
24649,1,Good and steady happy with the quality for the price it's a good buy. I would tell a friend to get it if they were looking for this product.
158221,1,"I love this carrier. I also have a front style carrier, but this one is much easier on my back. My baby seems very comfortable, and I love that you can use it when they are older to carry them on your hip. This baby is my third, so I am always busy around the house and it is nice to keep the baby close while I am doing other things. And, the quality is very high and I know it will last through several kids."
25482,0,"I used these for a long time and they're big and effective, but since they're rectangular they have to fold in on themselves. This creates an area where there is a lot more liner than there should be. It periodically caused chafing and this last time I just quite using them."
61512,0,It's great that its for free... but i'm just wondering why it is.... :))
123883,1,I like these bags for their quality and size. They fit really nice in my freezer and something about the quality of this bag is much nice than the madella ones.Because they are bigger than the Madella they flatten out nicely and don't take a lot of room in the freezer.
139672,1,"I love this product! Even though I purchase as a gift for 3 of my granddaughters, if I didn't think my husband would kill me, I would purchase one for my room! They are adorable!"
140731,1,"I have a 2009 Honda Pilot. It fit pretty good, I just had to tighten it off center to avoid the seatbelt drop on the ceiling. It took about 15 minutes to put together. I have a shepard mix & a lab mix that weigh 55 & 75 pounds respectfully, ages 10 & 7 years old. They really didn't try to challenge it, they were just happy to go for a ride. Our 11 month old sits safely in the middle row carseat, totally entertained by the pups in the back. Overall, I'm very pleased with the price & the product."
148592,0,"Being pregnant and using this pillow is difficult when you have to get up to urinate 10 times in a night. You'll end up fully awake struggling to get out of the bed with this thing! It does offer good support for sitting while watching t.v. or reading, or if you suffer from GERD. Like most of the other reviews, the pillow's head support seam digs into your shoulder unless you plop your regular pillow on top to block the seam. I did like the fact that this pillow does come with a pillow cover so that you can slip it off for laundering."
35604,1,"I and was shocked at how fast my son outgrew his infant carrier(20 lbs at 4 months). I saw this in the stores and figured it would be worth a try. I never expected it to be so great! I don't have to worry about germs or missing seatbelts anymore. Plus if my &quot;little&quot; boy is sleeping I lay his head down and he's comfy. My only problem is that it takes some getting use to putting in the cart when you're trying to juggle a baby, diaperbag and,the floppy. And all the people who stop to ask you about the seat will drive you batty! Eveyone should get one!"
129950,1,This car seat base is equal to the original that came with the stroller/car seat combo
115653,0,"Okay, not as good as expected. The vibrating head should encompass the entire side of the product, not just a small area."
113814,1,"This was a wonderful purchase for my newest grandson who has a Mom that is always on the go and involved with lots of events. Uses it at home, church, Boy Scouts, friend homes, etc. Easy to clean and easy to take!"
6307,0,"I like this monitor overall, but it needs some improvements.I like that I can keep this next to my bed with the video turned off so I can sleep. When I hear him start fussing I just flip on the video to see what he's up to. The picture is hit or miss though. It needs a stronger antenna or something - it's fuzzy a lot of the time but when I put my hand near it the picture gets better. The sound is good on the monitor and I also like the light meter that lets me know how loud the sound is.The power button is large and right on top of the unit... like a snooze button. I've actually hit the power button in the morning instead of my snooze alarm and shut the monitor off. It would be nice if there was a power indicator light so I would know when I do this! Sometimes he's so quiet I wonder if it's still on.Having AC adapters is nice; I like the picture I get even at night; lights, picture, and sound make it very easy to know what my son is doing."
156470,1,"This is very nice powder, but I'm not sure it is any better than Johnson's Baby Powder. It is certainly much more expensive. The fragrance is no better and they both do the job."
142083,1,The product seems to deliver what is advertised and promised. Very happy with the product and it seems to go a long way compared to some other brands.
6712,1,"These were great at $7.50, but too expensive now. I suggest Target to everyone. They have great prices and selection, as well as you can use your coupons!"
82133,1,I love this item because it's perfect for the diaper bag or in the car. It has been handy to me when my baby wasen't feel well I was able to take her temp. then give her medicine without having to open five differnt bags.
136055,0,"While the sensor is a great feature and certainly offers peace of mind (which is why we got it), the actual monitoring leaves much to be desired. The monitor is very prone to interference, has terrible range and constantly ""hisses"".. there is no sound-activated feature where it's muted while there is no or almost no noise. This is particularly annoying at night. The build quality is also pretty bad. One of our transmitters fell about 3 feet and broke immediately."
138624,1,This is the cutest thing!! My daughter absolutely LOVES it! It has 3 different colors you can turn the lights into. It projects so many stars all over the room! it also turns itself off to save battery life!
31229,1,"A carosel design that is quick to set up and sanitary for all the bottle accessories. Seems to be well made. Works well with Dr. Brown's bottles. My wife likes it, so that's good enough for me."
3168,1,"This is the only swaddler I used with my daughter. I had no problems with it. The only thing I would mention is that this one was a thin cotton, while the other one I had was fleece. I recommend you decide which one to buy based on the season. This one filled its purpose."
103384,1,"We bought this gate several months ago for the top of our stairs and LOVE it! It's extremely secure, easy to use (even one-handed), and very stable.Other gates we've tried have broken or come unmounted - causing them to be barriers to other rooms instead of gates, which has caused considerable inconvenience. We asked for two more of these gates for Christmas, and were excited to receive them, because we can start using the doorways in the first floor of our house again, instead of climbing over or going around to another route.Excellent, excellent product."
118121,1,"I JUST BOUGHT MY 3 YEAR OLD THIS BED TO GET HIM TO SLEEP IN HIS ROOM ,HE HATED THE CRIB. AND SLOWLY HES SLEEPING BY HIMSELF THROUGH THE NITE. WHEN HE'S BAD I TELL HIM IM GETTING THE CRIB BACK,AND HE SAYS NO ITS MY CAR BED SO THIS IS WORKING, I AM USING HIS CRIB MATTRESS FOR NOW AND WHEN HES OLDER THIS CAR FITS A TWIN BED SO HE WILL HAVE THIS FOR MANY YEARS. IS HEAVY DUTY,WELL MADE. I RECCOMMEND THIS BED HIGHLY."
11136,2,Maybe we did smth wrong but nothing comes out.My baby was sucking for 10 minutes and nothing!i've been using Avent with my both kids and the FDA approves the use of BPA in baby bottles.So I went back to Avent
183906,0,"we didn't have too many accidents with those, however they run about 1/2 size smaller. if you're between two sizes, go with the bigger one."
84732,0,I have had these on our door and it was working great. It kept our three year old and his grandparents out of the cupboard so that none of them could go rummaging for snacks. Unfortunately today marks the day that all of them know how to take the cover off of the handle. So it works well for children who cannot reach the knob and may work for children who give up easily. Our determined little boy has conquered the safety cover.
5345,1,"I purchased this prior to a flight to keep my new stroller protected and clean. It works great, especially for the price.My only two gripes:-It had a tear in the heavy-duty fabric after the first leg of our trip (not the bags fault, I'm sure).-It is really hard to fold small when you are in a time-crunch. There really is no good place to keep it stored, so be prepared for that especially if you plan to gate-check your stroller (which we did).We purchased the First Years Ignite stroller for this bag and it just barely fit length-wise. Loved the padding on one end and the shoulder strap.Would definitely recommend!"
158021,1,This product has given us peace of mind. It has never gone off at night when he is sleeping...thank goodness...but we do check it by taking him out and making sure it sounds the alarm and it always does.I would recommend it to any other nervous nelly parens like us.This is an update....my son is now too old for this. Once my son starting really moving around a lot he did set off the alarm twice. Both times I thought I would die and both times it was because my son was curled tight along the rails of his crib. This product does work though and I will use it again when we have another baby.
153549,2,"The way this company explains their shipping cost is not clear and I ended up paying more than half the cost of the lamp shade in shipping. When I received the lamp shade, I was terribly dissapointed in the quality. So I sent it back. Don't waist your time."
109359,1,"Feeding:My son had such bad reflux that getting him to eat was a challenge. Food was a total aversion for him. These feeders worked great to help teach him to eat. He was older and insisted on feeding himself, but didn't have the skills for it yet. I mixed dry baby cereals into his baby food and this worked great! It also meant that he wouldn't chew pieces off things that were bigger than he could handle. It really saved my life in getting him to start liking solid food. I highly recommend it for independent babies who have trouble taking to solids!Teething:My son is now an ice chewer. He's now teething molars (he's fifteen months) and has no interest in his toys or teething biscuits. I simply melt an icecube enough to get it into the pocket and he chews away. He feels better, doesn't get bored, and I don't have to pick up ice from everywhere and console my son's crying over freezing fingers. :) This is the best teething tool I have found for him!"
33065,1,"I first used these while nursing our third baby and my nipples were cracked and bleeding. I was assured that latching on was correct. I am fair-skinned, so maybe that contributed to the problem. Whatever. The shells helped almost immediately and within a couple of days I was so much more comfortable.We just had our fourth baby and I've been using the shells since my milk came in. I've had NO PAIN whatsoever!I know proper nursing isn't supposed to hurt, but in my case (and most of my friends' cases) there are a few weeks when latching on and getting going can be pretty toe-curling. These shells saved me from that this time around. I don't know why they are not promoted more! They are so worth the money!"
143150,0,I bought this as a formula dispenser but I think it will serve better as a snack cup. It does not hold enough formula if I am going out on a one day trip or so. Moreover formula doesnt easily come out of the opening. You have to shake it 5-6 times. But I found it helpful coz I can mix formula and cereal in one compartment and use it while we're outside. and we need not carry the cereal tub separately.
63765,1,"We bought this for our 6 month baby and it came in very handy. Easy to assemble, solid, nice colors, easy to clean.The plastic latch is a bit too tight (you have to press the button really hard to unlatch), but this may be in the end more of a benefit of added safety so that thee baby won't be able to open it easily.If there is something we do not like is the fact that the height of the seat cannot be adjusted in relation to the height of the tray."
90074,1,"Pampers Baby Dry and Luvs have been our two go-to brands for our active little guy. For Newborn-thru-2, Pampers were definitely our favorites. But once he hit size three, we've gone with both of these numerous times....and about the only thing we can say for sure is we like both better than Huggies!!! We did get one batch of Pampers about 3 months ago where the elastic tabs would sometimes break or come apart, but Pampers to their credit gave us a refund as well as some half-off coupons that we could use at the local Tarzjay! Probably just a random bad batch or something -- no probs on the others.In the end, it really comes down to cost....and if you compare Pampers vs. Luvs, Luvs ends up being a few cents cheaper per diaper. Given the way the Dems and Republicans are ruining the economy, every cent makes a difference. Hence the reason I'm giving Luvs a 5-star and Pampers a 4-star rating -- both are excellent but Luvs are just a little cheaper!"
56725,1,"I like this product so far but, boy are they difficult to install. Our toddler could open the latch locks by pulling hard, that we installed 5 years ago, so we needed a different option. He definately cannot open these. The magnet is finicky unless everything is lined up perfectlyand the latch itself isn't to tight against the cabinet itself. We had to adjust several times.Overall I am very pleased. I'm not sure they can make it easier to install - it is the nature of the beast."
68501,2,"Like another reviewer, we REALLY wanted to love this stroller. We have a Maclaren single stroller and had strongly considered the double, but bought the Peg Perego Twin Aria because it was significantly lighter and had a single handlebar to steer and a single basket. I am regretting it now!Our problems with the Aria (not in any order of importance; I'm too sleep-deprived to do that right now!):1) The Aria stickers came off after about a week's worth of use.2) The handling is, in my husband's words, ""squishy"". We have a 25-month-old and a 3-month old and the weight difference between them makes this challenging to push...because the plastic parts on the stroller have a LOT of give.3) It's REALLY hard to push around the neighborhood over bumps, holes and big cracks in the sidewalk (we live in Chicago). Just too much give in the steering.4) The basket DOES drag on the ground (I admit that we overload it, but we use this around town and put a lot of stuff in it).5) It's very easy to open and close, as long as you use both hands (if you are holding a baby and trying to do it, it's much harder). If you have garage space and don't need to open and close it all the time, this will benefit you!!Okay, the good:1) Love the look.2) Love the deep seats (and both recline).3) Love the food trays (and the option to NOT use them).4) Love that it stands up on its own when folded! Genius.I just expected much more stability for the price. If you are NOT hard on strollers and don't have to fold/unfold it all the time, you'll probably really like this stroller. We are just heavy-duty users and need something with more staying power!"
145497,1,"This has been the greatest to occupy my little grandaughter. She is 5 1/2 months old & just loves it. I can sit her in this and she just bounces constantly, really enjoys it tremendously. She also watches a Baby Einstein dvd over & over while sitting in this, has been a Godsend for me while babysitting her."
9029,0,"This products EATS batteries &amp; does skip sometimes, BUT it is very convenient &amp; is helpful at naptime!"
51658,1,"Okay, I read some of the reviews and found the negative ones sort of silly. We have use our peg perego high chair for EIGHT years and five kids and LOVE it. In fact we ended up with 3 of them for our triplets, and like the older version better than the 2 newer ones we had to add. Today I was actually washing up the last one to put into the attic to save for grandkids. I just can't part with it. I love all the positions although we rarely changed positions. We folded them down to take on vacation. Yes, any high chair will collect food and straps will get dirty. I would NEVER get a cloth seat however b/c I can't imagine having to take it off daily to wash it. We had the leatherette which wiped up very easily. The tray was easy to remove and stayed in place. We love the wheels to pull it up to you...handy with feeding triplets. I realize all kids are different, but with 5 children we never had one try to climb out. In fact one of the things I didn't like about the newer models were all the shoulder straps. I tucked them behind the seat cover and never used them. We did have the leg straps fairly snug however. The only negative was that the white leatherette seat did wear pretty quickly and look dingy and the replacement covers are WAY overpriced.I did not understand the comment about a baby not being able to reach the tray. When they are that little they of course will not be able to sit up high enough and close enough to the tray. We fed them as 6 month olds in a bouncy seat or the reclining position of the high chair and it didn't really matter how far away the tray was from them.I would highly recommend this high chair and it is the only one I would buy again...even better when they are a gift..."
160757,2,"it seems to be that my baby wasn't comfortable on it. The cotton layer really doesn't insullate well from the plastic underneath so my baby would wake up with a sweaty spotty back (we didn't find his skin to be especially sensitive otherwise so it's definitely a reaction to this product...) Just to make sure you undertand how your baby feels, think of the hospital beds. They are lined with plastic with just a cotton sheet over them. After a day or so they make your skin itch. This is the same construction so why should it feel any different...It does protect the pretty sheet underneath but why would you even bother having a pretty sheet if this thing completely covers it... Just buy those white & blue sheets that you can use and then toss."
55994,0,"Well worth the Money, but it needs an off switch! I have to unplug the unit after each use, and that is almost impossable to do w, a screaming baby in my arms. I rectify this problem by only partially plugging it into the outlet so it can easily be removed w/ one hand.If you want this affordable bottle warmer to work to your advantage, ignore the directions and don't bother w/ the little vial for the refills.Place the bottle in the warmer then pour water in until almost full. Takes about 60 seconds to get hot. To speed up the process, I keep a kitchen towel near by and constantly remove and shake the bottle."
120295,2,"These are the worst bottle brushes out there. They are not sturdy and bend while washing. I used mine only 5 times and the sponge at the top came off. I am pumping and then bottle feeding 5 times a day so I need a reliable brush to wash my breast pump parts and my Dr. Brown bottles, and these do not do the job. So far my favorite have been the Munchkin with the sponge on the top, they look like these but hold up much better. Unfortunately I can't find them on Amazon."
167888,1,"While I'm no fan of Huggies diapers (we quickly switched to Pampers after growing tired of the leaks), I had to comment on the reviewer who said ""after your child goes in them once they sag so bad you have to go change them"". ???? Why would you want to leave your child uncomfortable in a wet/dirty diaper simply because it WASN'T sagging? Reminds me of the old joke ""but Doctor, it SAID it holds 12-18 lbs??!!"".Anyway...Now that we're potty training, we've become Huggies fans. We LOVE the Pull-ups. They work great for us. No leaks, they hold up well to a few pull-ups and pull-downs, and I do believe the wetness liner is helping to make potty training easier."
54243,1,"I originally purchased an adorable pastel teddy bear mobile for my daughter before she was born. A good friend of mine (who's daughter was three months at the time) completely talked me into exchanging it for this one, and I'm glad she did!Both girls are totally mesmerized by the colors, shapes and soothing music. It's not a good idea to use it as a sleeping aide as it very stimulating. It's great to use as an attention getter when I am doing laundry, showering or anytime I can not be holding her. Keeps her totally content and playful by herself for a much longer than expected time period!Definately worth it!"
67187,0,"Product came as ordered, but is not of particularly good quality. It meets our needs, but the step portion wiggles a bit and I don't think it's sturdy enough to use as a step stool for the child when they are older, as some nursing stools are. Also, the adjust ability is mediocre. I find the lowest setting is too slanted, but the other two settings are too flat. I think there is a possibility of a child pinching a finger in the adjustment holes since there is no way of locking it in place, and all it takes to adjust it is to lift the platform with your toe (convenient, but I will be putting it away if our son starts showing an interest in it as a toy). It would be better if it even just clicked into place, or had slightly smaller notches for the adjustable parts. It works for now, and I guess I got what I paid for, but I would not recommend this item to a friend."
30805,0,"Unless you are actually at the stage of your baby/toddler self feeding, it's not really good to spoon feed your baby.I find that the spoon is very flat, so there isn't enough room to hold food to put into my daughter's mouth to eat. The best use I get out of it is a distraction so that she has something to hold on to while I'm feeding her. Until she learns to self feed, she won't be using these utensils. Pretty expensive toy to use if it's only used as a distraction."
183953,1,"If I was oozing money I wouldn't mind buying Huggies & Pampers they are great diapers (I'm not comparing LUVs with these two brands.) But what I am saying is that if you want a less expensive solution without compromising quality and comfort for your baby than LUVs is it.My husband and I have been using LUVs diapers since my son was a size 2 diaper (now he's using a size 4) and I LOVE LUVS. Why?1) They hold leakage & his bowel movements (including blow-outs) without leakage... unlike the other generic brands I've tried(Walmart & target brand).2) The material is soft not scratchy to the skin and not soggy when it's super soaked with urine (that's something that bothered me about the other generics is that they got very soggy.) LUVs holds up wonderfully... it's as close as you can get to Pampers and Huggies without compromising quality and that brings me to my next point.3) IT SAVES TONS OF MONEY! It costs significantly less than Huggies & Pampers but DOES NOT compromise quality. They may feel thinner, I remember going from the newborn huggies/pampers to LUVs and thinking that the absorbing part didn't feel as fluffy... but you'd be surprised... this diaper can really absorb. Just b/c THESE diapers are less expensive... does not mean ""you get what you pay for"". I love LUVs for these 3 reasons.4) LUVs is conveniently located in area Safeways, Kmarts, Targets and of course AMAZON (why not get it delivered to your door for FREE at a great price?!)5) I am friends with several mommies with kids of differing ages and they ALL use LUVs (they're the ones that got me hooked on LUVs). So this isn't just my ""testimony"" but I am just affirming the opinion of other many other mothers with kids from newborn to toddler.Oh and some random advice... if you know your kids is going to be in a diaper for a long duration (w/out a change) i.e... bedtime... try using a diaper 1 size up. I don't have to do this with the LUVs diapers b/c they hold it all in but if you are using another brand and find leakage a problem this might be something to try?"
136386,1,We bought this play center for our daughter when she turned 5 months old. It's fun and she's learning a lot too with the variety of activities and toys. She especially loves the music that comes from the front panel buttons. Everyone loves to watch her move around the play center; it's as if she's working a control station. My only concern is one of the toys could feasibly hit her in the face if she pulled it back hard enough. So far this hasn't been an issue. The play center stays at her babysitter's house but we're planning to buy another one for home. She loves it that much.
37702,1,"I ORDERED THE CRIB SET, LAMP, VALANCES, PILLOW & LAMP SHADE IN THE KOI DESIGN FOR MY SON. SOZO'S PRODUCTS ARE VERY WELL MADE. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT I RECEIVED AND MY SON'S ROOM IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. I MATCHED A PAINT WITH THE PALE BLUE COLOR ON THE PILLOW AND HIS WALLS MATCH VERY WELL. EVERYONE COMPLIMENTS ME ON MY NURSERY. I WISH SOZO MADE WALL HANGINGS, RUGS OR A MOBILE WITH THE PATTERN - BUT FISHER PRICE'S AQUARIUM MOBILE GOES GREAT WITH IT..."
45117,1,My son loved all the animals and liked the lights and things to play with on the ground to he began to roll over with this product.
3438,1,I couldn't be happier with my purchase. As promised I received my order in a matter of 3 days. Baby is due in 4 weeks and these will surely be put to good use when I start using my Medela breast pump.
79010,1,"If you're using Dr Brown's bottles, you already know it is a 5 part bottle, 6 if you count the bottle cap, which I use on every bottle, to keep the nipple clean after I assemble them for use.Not to mention part # 7 the bottle cap which I also use!So you can imagine cleaning one bottle after use means I'm drying 7 parts! The rack itself is great, but definitely does not accommodate all of the parts I have to wash and dry! Still I don't think any other rack would have come close to what I need with the dr. brown's bottles. Because there are so many parts, I honestly don't know what would be better! (That's not my job!) But I do wish there was a better organizational way of drying all the parts. Because it serves its purpose I rate it 4 stars... because it does not take into account all the parts I have to dry. I take one star away."
137945,1,"We were having problems getting our 4 year old to sleep through the night in her own bed. She insisted on sleeping with a light on because she was scared. The light would then wake her up in the middle of the night. I tried turning off the light after she was asleep, but she would wake up and call for me to turn the light back on. ""Star"" as she named her turtle has solved our problem. She turns it on when I put her to bed, and she falls asleep before the turtle shuts off 45 minutes later. If she wakes up scared during the night she presses the button and the turtle gets her back to sleep. I have not had her wake me up one time in the 2 months since we bought the turtle. I also reward her for every 5 nights she sleeps in her bed (without waking me up) by giving her a ""ticket"" to sleep with us for one night. She loves her turtle so much it has to go with us every time we leave town. It was a little expensive, but I need my sleep so it was well worth the money."
160760,1,I just love the Ultimate Crib Sheet! It saves time because I don't have to change the mattress pad or fitted sheet nearly as often. I just throw the ultimate crib sheet in the wash and then snap it back on the bed. This is definitely a must have product for us!
18734,1,"I absolutely LOVE the Miracle Blanket. I have a fussy 2 month old who weighs almost 16 pounds. He is able to break free from every blanket we own. However, with the Miracle Blanket he stays nice and snug! Once we started wrapping him in his Miracle Blanket he started sleeping at night from every 2 hours to every 4 hours IMMEDIATELY. He is now sleeping from 4 1/2 to 6 hours through the night! I wish I would have had this blanket when my son was first born. I recommend this blanket to every parent of a newborn/infant!"
73384,2,"I purchased this for a shower gift after having a child of my own and thinking that this product could have saved me some wondering during blurry-eyed nights. Of course months after the shower after the baby arrives, the couple removes the packaging and throws it away before turning it on- the display is broken. It has a few bars showing and the functions don't work. How embarrassing to spend money on a shower gift only to have it broken!! With the packaging gone, I assumed I couldn't return it so I apologized to the couple and flushed $25 down the toilet."
128305,1,"Works great.. used it for two kids, no breaking or problems. Very convenient and doesn't slip. My son preferred using this over the big padded seat we used at home."
152118,1,"Beautiful window valance. I did have to email the seller almost a week after I had ordered, to see when it was shipping out. Then I got it quickly."
68552,2,"We recently purchased this item and are very unhappy. The fabric was smelly and we washed it which made the fabric rough. The sheet then did not fit onto the pad and now we do not have a sheet to use. After we assembled the unit, it seems too wobbly for us to use and we are going to return the item. This was too much money for the item that we were shipped. I hope that helps so other people are not disapointed like we are."
94247,1,My daughter could spend more than an hour in this one!!! I ofcourse being her mom always worried and never took my eyes off of her in it...I was afraid it would fall down-- It never did. We even have pictures of her falling asleep in it. She would tire herself out. As far as the woman saying that the seat fell out well...I would have to say that the seat was not put on properly. That seat took some time and effort to put in. I can not see any other way it coming off unless in was not put on the right way.
34379,1,"this stuff has saved my son from severe diaper rash.. For wipes, I use a non-alcholic witch hazel and use cotton balls.. it's really is amazing.. but i wish it came in a bigger tube!"
112942,0,"I bought this dresser in Espresso almost 2 years ago to match the crib and changing table I got at the same time from Amazon. Assembled this alone (I'm a female) but did take a few hours. The main issue I've had was that the cam screws came loose with use and then the drawer would fall apart and all the clothes fell out. After putting several if the drawers back together a few times, I finally solved this problem by going back and applying some hot glue inside each cam before (quicky) screwing each closed. No problems with that part of it since. The other issue is with the bottom drawer which doesn't seem to want to stay on the track all the way. Every time I push it back in, I have to give it an extra nudge to pop it back on the track and close it flush with the rest of the dresser front. I like the way it looks but it's not the highest quality."
179160,2,"If you want an expensive bottle that leaks expensive formula this is the one for you. Contacted playtex and they suggested I send them in so they could determine the cause. It's not rocket science. The ""seal"" in the bottom doesn't work. Great customer service when you suggest I spend more money on the bottles to ship them back. Switched to Avent. My twins actually feed better and they're guaranteed leak free."
127002,1,I had spent the extra money on the Little Movers for my 27 month old but these are just as good. I have not had a leak yet. My only complaint is the Amazon Mom discount shrinking every time I blink. They are thicker than the Pampers version. I tried the Pampers but stopped after too many leaks. Huggies are the superior diaper.
58016,2,"These cups did not come with handles, and the spouts are green, not white. Not what I thought I ordered. Very disappointed."
69707,1,"I bought these for my 2 year old daughter's bedroom after much searching for the ""perfect"" curtains. These are a nice mild pink (not a super hot-pink like many others) and the gentle gingham pattern is nice. I bought this to work with the Circo Puppies & Kittens comforter set - this fits the bill and allows us to pursue a nice pastel palette for her room instead of adopting a full PINK! bedroom. Only 4 stars as I wish they had a little more than the standard width to them... but otherwise are fine."
99599,2,"I tried these diapers b/c my daughter's diaper was leaking at night, and these were the worst of all of the diapers I tried.

170366,0,"All I know is that this thing is a living hell to install. Just know that once you get it in, don't remove it until you sell your can."
90470,1,I love these diapers as well as the economy size. This is one of the best diaper deal for high quality diapers I have seen. We go through 2 cases a month and the subscribe and save is a great option as well. Pampers keep my sons dry through the night!
83773,1,"My year old nephew loves this...I'm shocked that it really does ""suction"" onto the table & the little trough at the end catches his droppings most of the time. I would reommend"
160042,1,This is one of those items we could not live without. It keeps our little one swaddled all night long. Without it he would escape from his blanket swaddle in no time and his flailing arms would wake him up. The Kiddopotamus also helps him nap longer especially when wrapped in a blanket first.
127289,0,"looks nice but it is hard to assemble..CS was not very friendlymake sure though you have time when you start this and make sure you do it right so you dont need to call CS and ask for parts.also get the teething guard for the sides with this and put them on... the babies love to bite on the sides of this and if there is no guard on it will destroy the crib and you will find bunch of brown residue in your baby's mouth..babies have sharp teeth and this crib is soft and paint comes off easy..use it right and be careful and it will last you a good while.. we had ours for 3 years by now and 2 kids.final point : INSTALL IT WELL, GET THE TEETH GUARD lol--------------------If you fine my reviews helpful please mark it as so.. Thank you."
60798,1,"I registered for this when I was pregnant with my first daughter and she now 11 months old. We have used it from the first day home and have NEVER had a problem with the smell. I agree that an open diaper might cause a smell but if you roll it up and use it's own tabs to close it you shouldn't have a problem, and they will take up less space in the Diaper Genie. As far as having to empty it every week - I empty out every other trash can in my house AT LEAST that often - if not more... who wants to keep trash around the house anyway?? I probably use one refill a month in our Genie and they aren't that expensive, sure it's cheaper to buy a trash can with regular liners but I promise you'll take out the trash more than once a week, and you'll spend a lot on air fresheners!!! We love our Genie!!"
14972,0,"I bought these bottles because I had heard how great they were when switching from bottle to breast. I introduced a bottle to my son at 4 weeks, and it was a fight to get him to drink more than 1 ounce in 20 minutes. I tried different nipple sizes thinking that was the problem. After 2 weeks, I gave up and tried different bottles. He does fine with the other bottles I've tried. For whatever reason, my son hated the Avent nipples. I think it was because the nipples were long and not very flexible. Sometimes he would gag when the nipple was in his mouth. The nipples on the bottles I use now are shorter and more flexible."
68459,2,I am very disappointed that this stroller was so expensive and not worth a penny. I used the stroller 5 times since its purchase (witha three month old and a 2 year old weighing a total of 41 pounds) I found several problems with this stroller after the fourth use.1 - the stroller is hard to steer. The front wheels do not swivel very well at all. I found myself practically puching the stroller with the feeling as though the wheel were lock and they were not.3 - The basket underneath draggs. you cannot store anything other than a coloring book and small bottle bag. anything more than that the basket is on the floor.5 - The sunshades began to warp slightly.Babies r us is giving me a hard time to return the stroller which I find disappointing since I spend plenty of money there. I am hoping to get my money back to purchase the combi (which my girlsfriend has and loves)
167947,1,"I (along with several other mothers) have tried a variety of nipples for bottles. The shape makes latching easy and I LOVE that Nuk provides several different flows. It helped us graduate our baby through the various stages of development. The NUK was originally given to me at the hospital by a nurse - she said the shape is more agreeable with babies who are both nursing and taking a bottle. I believe she was right. So many moms I know have had trouble getting their nursing babies to be flexible with switching between nursing and bottles. When I've recommended NUKs, I've received 100% success feedback so far from the moms I recommended it to. For the price, it's well worth trying. They do fit most bottles (don't fit Playtex or Prince Lionhearted unfortunately)."
71226,1,"I was lucky and picked up the older model at a garage sale for dirt cheap. Used this product with my first child and 4 years later I am now using it again with my second. This chair has a long life - what a beautiful concept!Some of the other chairs out there are so expensive and baby grows out of them way too quickly. You can use this chair for a long time -- to feed baby, have baby watch videos (BTW Baby Mozart kept both of my kids occupied for the entire length of the video early on), have them play with their toys or just hang out with the family.I was looking into purchasing the Bebepod or Bumbo, however, unless you purchase it while your baby is very young, they will outgrow it way too quickly - just like the bouncers.I love the old model and the newer model looks even better!If you don't want a million baby products laying around the house - just invest in this one. I think you will be very happy with it:)"
144650,1,"I have been researching infant car seats for a couple of months and finally decided on this one. I have been going back and forth between the Chicco Key Fit, the Graco Safe Seat, and Peg Perego seats. I chose this one because:-The Chicco Key Fit looks a lot difference in person than it does on the internet. The fabric of the carseat did not seem like it was skin friendly, expecially for hot weather, it looked like it would cause irritation and just be uncomfortable to be in.-The Graco Safe Seat also looked a lot better online than it does in person. The colors were great, but the actual seat and base looked very cheap. When my huband and I went to Babies R Us to test out how this seat would fit in our car, we had two problems with it: it was huge in our car, and our car is not a small one. And the base, no matter how much we tightened it, once the seat was on the base, it would wobble around and i hated that!-The Peg Perego car seats are great looking, but too expensive and they do not look that comfortable.I am so happy with my purchase of the Combi Connection. The fabric is so soft and I love the Mommy's Lap insert. There are also two little covers that go over the straps to keep the straps from rubbing against the baby's neck and face. We love the fact the you just have to pull one strap on the front of this seat to tighten all of the other straps. One of the things that I love the most about this seat is that the BASE will recline to fit any baby's needs. This has been the easiest car seat to install. Our car does not have a LATCH system, so we had to undo the buckle of the middle seat belt and ""rig"" it the same way the LATCH straps were and it was still very easy (This only work if your seat belt is a lap balt that has a buckle that will come off). Overall, the quality of this seat, the fact that it's sturdy in any position, and the soft fabric were enough to win me over. But once I got the seat and installed it, the fact the it doens't budge at all just reassured me that this car seat was very safe and sturdy. I love this seat, and face it, babies outgrow these things faster than you would believe and there is not point in spending over $200.00 when you have to turn around and but a convertable car seat a few months later. This car seat is worth the price and is padded so well in the right areas and very light yet heavy enough to be very safe. BUY IT! It's the best car seat around...trust me...I've looked."
59837,1,"The bathtub is priceless. I read reviews previous to registering and I was so glad that I did. Although it takes up a lot of space and isn't very cute, it is worth its weight in gold. It holds baby so well from the very beginning and provides the ""extra hands"" I need for a productive yet safe bath-time. I can foresee us using this bath for a long-time and I recommend it to everyone I know!"
7300,2,"I'm breastfeeding, so the baby tends to soil a lot more than if he was formula fed. Which means he's getting wiped a lot more. These are thick, not terribly soft but not the scratchiest. But they turned his little butt red within a week! I had samples of Pampers Sensitive- which were much better. Thinner, softer, and a bit moister. I also have the Lansinoh Clean & Condition wipes which were even better. I definitely won't be buying the Huggies wipes again- guess I'll use them to clean my preschoolers hands and such."
146221,1,"We got this for my daughter when she was 4 months old. She liked it then as a place to hang out and look around. Now, when we put her in there, she LOVES jumping around, pulling at the toys, playing, exploring, etc. Love this jumperoo!"
64402,2,"I am a good sized man (6'3"" 200lbs) and I can carry a backpack filled with stuff on a hike without much trouble - but i didn't make it 10 minutes with this pack.My kid = 31 inches, 21 lbs.I tried adjusting chest strap, the waist strap, the back straps; everything.I can't make it 10 minutes without my shoulders feeling like they are going to explode and my fingers going numb.Carrying just 21 lbs!!To make this useable, they need to:1. GREATLY improve the waist-strap so the weight is actually carried there and the padding is enough to handle the load.2. Tilt the kid slightly forward so they aren't leaning back away from you. Think about giving a piggy back with someone leaning against your back vs. away and you will get the picture of why this thing is unusable.10 minutes, max. It is going back today."
89807,1,"In the year we have been using these, my son has never once soaked through. Not even over night. That speaks VOLUMES in this house!!!"
32456,1,"I'm glad we read the reviews before we bought this gate, but wish we had measured our stairway first. The reviewer who said he had to buy the extension kit was right. We bought this gate anyway because we didn't want to mount brackets. ... The opening takes some coordination as well and seems to work easier right-handed. I give it 4 stars mainly because of having to buy the extension and it doesn't really accommodate the design of our stairway, but it is adjustable. And keep in mind the manufacturer's comment that it isn't best suited for a stairway because of it being pressure mounted. Stepping over the bottom rail is awkward too when it's on a step like ours is."
134858,1,"My daughter is now 3 months old and I love this car seat.1. Easy to take in and out of the base2. Hood adjusts to cover baby in sunlight or in stores where you don't want people touching your newborn, hee hee :)3. Pattern is great, doesn't get too hot4. Fabric holds up greatEnjoy!"
99704,1,"Pampers diapers are very absorbant and fit my babies well. The only thing that I wish Pampers would change is to take the scent off the diapers. Huggies aren't scented, and I prefer them because of that. My babies have gotten rashes because of the perfume."
163198,2,"The ""new"" Tubsider is a shadow of its former self. We had the original Tubsider for years and we adored it. Eventually one of my boys broke ours and I searched high and low to replace it eventually calling Infantino and being told that it was being improved and would come out soon. I bought the new and improved model immediately and have been cursing the day that I threw the pieces of the old away ever since. Problems with this product include 1) the gel pads do not stay put and are not very forgiving, 2) the height of the seat is all wrong for both my husband (who is average height) and me (I am short) and cannot really be adjusted 3)the seat comes off every time you try to move the contraption out of the way 4)when you try to move it all of the pieces go in different directions as they have made it too flexible for its own good. Compared to not having a Tubsider at all this product certainly helps but it needs a lot of work."
2519,1,"For my baby shower we did a diaper raffle, so I received every diaper brand out there. These are by far the best out there. My little boy is 5 months old and is in size 3. Never any leakage problems even through the night. All my friends swear by them too!!!"
56288,1,"I bought my Zippy a little over a year ago and was hesitant to spend the money at first. However, I am very pleased with the quality of the ride for my child and how it handles. This is my 3rd stroller and favorite by far. It looks great and sporty. It handles like a champ AND it does fold with just ONE HAND! Many claim to, but the ZIPPY really has a great folding system. It feels VERY well made. I am sure that I will get a lot of use out of it, and I will save it for the next baby!"
182108,1,"Love my Prince Lionheart Wipes Warmer. These are a must-have! I just wanted to leave this review to mention that Walmart.com has the same exact thing for cheaper. You only get 2 refills here.. there you get 4, for practically the same price. FYI."
181197,1,Easy to put together..took a while to figure where the batteries went..under the giraffe's butt..:) My little girl LOVES the music and lights and I lowered the toys at first with some of those links u can get anywhere..then i raised them after she started knocking them around too close to her face..great price since it is much higher at retail stores..
170454,0,"I bought this seat for it's rave reviews and safety rating. I am confortable knowing my child is in the safest seat out there. I purchased two of these seats (an extra one for grandma's car) and received a reduced rate and free shipping for having bought two and taking the cowmoofladge pattern, which may not sell as well as others but is more attactive in person than the picture does it justice. I bought an onyx for myself, but now wish the cow pattern was mine, lol!HOWEVER, my baby is five months old and about 20-lbs at this point. The reviews I read said that the seat ""reclines"" which was important to me. I want my baby to have the best of everything, to be comfy as can be and to be SAFE. But this seat has a minimal recline to it, and is no where near the amount of ""recline-ability"" that the infant seat I'd been using up to the point of getting this product. So his little head hangs in front of him when he falls asleep and he looks terribly uncomfortable. He cries sometimes when I put him into it and usually every time getting him out (if I don't get him out fast enuf). The seat is LARGE and obstructs my view out the rear passenger window. I can no longer see him the mirror on the head rest he faces, which I'd used before with his other seat in orfer see him from my rear-view mirror. Also, I no longer have the option of putting his smaller car seat into/on to the shopping cart when I go to the store--something to think about moms.In time, my baby will grow and hopefully this seat will be a better product for him down the line. However, as things are now, I would not have taken him out of the seat he was in before this one, until later. And I might have reconsidered another model also, as far as being able to see out my window and using the mirror that I had back there to view him from.I spent alot of money to end up having such mixed feelings.:("
75418,2,Item is very poor quality....item arrived with blue discoloration all over white part of the pad....most likely from blue color wipe container that comes with this pad and is included.
94982,1,I just bought this pump and LOVE IT!! I was worried it would not have the pumping power of the more expensive pumps but I was wrong. It pumps as well as the more expensive ones I have used. I would recommend it highly!
22098,1,These bags make pumping easier and faster. You can pump directly into the bags and put them directly in the freezer or fridge.
121777,2,Everyone raved about the Boppy pillow but I found it too fluffy. I do like the cover that this one came with and wished I was able to keep just that. I ended up returning this product because it didn't make breastfeeding easier but more difficult. I did find a less fluffier one at Babies R Us which was more expensive. I prefer to buy everything from Amazon but I guess it was something I needed to actually touch and try first.
36568,1,"We got the koala harness and it is great. Its comfy and totally cute. I think the gray is so sweet and versatile. I also makes a good pillow if your toddler wants to nap while out and about.We were worried at first if she would throw a fit (she is a very subborn and independent two year old) but what we did is put it on her, pop it on my wrist, hold her hand and leave for a walk immediately. She almost instantly began to associate it with getting out of the house and exploring. After a week of doing that, it didnt phase her one bit to wear it."
67557,1,My son loves this seat (and the cupholders).This seat is so very portable and easy to use that we bought a second for my daughter.
140932,0,"The pump works great. The three storage bag system is great. But Playtex gets a WTF for including everything you would need for a feeding except Bottle Nipples! WTF Playtex? You include a car power adapter, two bottles, drop in liners, two storage bottles, and you can't throw in a .50 cent nipple? That's comparable to going to a ball game, buying a hot dog, and then having to go to another vending stand to get ketchup, which you have to pay extra for. I'm sorry, it's a great product, but not including at least one nipple is simply inexcusable."
108733,0,"The wood in the photo looks a lot darker in the picture shown than it actually was when it showed up. It's more of an orange color, rather than a cherry/mahogany color."
139243,1,"Not sure about how long it will last, but it was purchased for a baby. The baby loves to look at all the stars that the turtle displays. The shell is hard plastic. Doesn't set itself off from anything that can't be purchased at a major store."
101181,1,"What can I say, these are Pampers, the best brand out there in a disposable diaper. Every now and then I surprise my daughter with one of these giant boxes, and needless to say, she's happy. And they are a great deal through Amazon. I try to buy them through Warehouse Deals whenenever I can - the box might be a little beat up, but diapers are separately packaged inside, so they are just fine."
41275,1,The only diaper that consistently does not leak. I have tried them all and would not use any other.
180197,2,I bought this breast pump just to help me while I am at home so that I can bottle feed the baby at night and give myself a break every once in a while. The first time I used it; it seemed okay and I was able to get a little milk but there was not much suction. I have only been able to get results when using it once. I have tried to use it many times since then and there is not really any suction and certainly not enough milk to save as it takes forever to get a few drops. I do not recommend this product even for stay at home moms.
172385,1,I really like this tub the only problem that I have found with it is that the part over the edge of the tub doesn't go down all the way over the house bath tub.
9652,1,"My wife just purchase this potti chair and we can`t be happier with the results. The same day she brought it home, our son did number one immediately. I don`t know what made him do it so quickly, but it works. It so easy to clean with no mess. This is a must have if you are experiencing trouble in making your son go to the potti."
27024,1,"I love this product and was carrying heavy with my second child. Unfortunately lost the pregnancy but when I do get pregnant again I will definitely use this again and it is adjustable so you may wear it all 3 trimesters if need be, it did get a little sweaty, lol."
154643,1,"No harsh chemicals - what more is there to say! Plus, when my little guy has had a diaper rash, other wipes would make him cry and these didn't bother him at all - why would we want to make a diaper rash worse! We use these exclusively now, and they work very well."
119404,0,"One of my friends recommended this to me for feeding my baby. After using this for a couple of days, realized that this is not good for c-section tummy. this puts lots of pressure on the abdomen."
169328,1,Love these diapers. They really work great and the price is right. They stay dry and don't leak unless it's a BIG mess :)
9937,1,"First, please no videos of this product in use.attaches secruely to toilet. It's got the pee blocker for boys that'll come in handy for our second. I gave it four stars as it doesn't actaully do the potty training..."
65549,0,"Before I bought the stroller, I read the reviews...I just wish I would've listened a little better. The sunshade is useless, and the cup holder should've been called ""key holder"". One of the reasons I bought the stroller was because it was so easy to steer. After a few months though, the steering has become difficult.The only good things about this stroller after almost a year, are how flat it folds, it's very light weight, and it reclines fairly flat.I do regret buying this stroller."
73611,1,"See what others have written, both positive and negative, for details on this useful tool. My addition is to report an odd failure and with the perspective of an electrical engineer. During three weeks of usage, our unit has randomly reset itself to 12:00 AM/no alarms perhaps a dozen times. This sometimes occurred twice in a day, and seems to have little relation to battery life. In fact, I measured the first set of batteries at roughly 1.49 volts when the failures began (nominal for new alkaline AAAs is 1.6 volts or so, and they are often usable down to 1.2 volts, which is nominal for many rechargeables.) A second set of batteries seemed to help for a day or two, but the issue has returned.An earlier negative review mentioned battery life issues. If this device does indeed require better than 4.5 volts from its batteries in some instances, that might indicate an issue with some batches of components used in assembly. I've purchased a replacement and am returning the failing unit, so I'll follow up if the problem is repeated.Our usage has mainly been intended to try to preempt a very wet diaper or full waking hunger. That plan and this timer (when it hasn't reset itself) have worked so well that I can count on one hand the number of times I've heard my son howling in that truly heartbroken cry he gave in the delivery room. Feeding and changing before he wakes enough to 'complain' has worked well for us. Your results may vary, of course.A side comment on the review which mentioned a desire to have tracking of more details than just time, in two words: feature creep. Seriously, I've heard that there's an app for that - and by that, I mean tracking the details of your child's feeding and diaper changes, not the urge to add complexity to single-function appliance designs! ;-)*** Update Nov. 8th, 2011: Still using the same batteries after four months or so, and still using the light in this unit during the nights. We don't use the timers any longer, and our son still doesn't cry very much. But I do still think that the Itzbeen timers helped him develop into the usually contented baby he is now."
57652,0,"My 3 year old son fell in love with this neck pillow immediately. He said, ""it looks just like Blue on Blue's Clues."" He wears it around the house, and can't wait to wear it on road trips, plane rides, etc. But I noticed a rip in the seam around the dog's neck. It can easily be repaired with a few stitches, but it shows a lack of quality in the product. I feel it is a bit overpriced."
52306,1,"These panties are thick, wash well, dry well, and most of all fit really well. They are really well made. I would buy more if we needed more. Great for potty training. Sizing is accurate on description."
152488,1,We bought this bed for our 17mos old son after he learned to climb out of his crib. He LOVES it and climbes in and out of it from every end and every way possible. Highly recommend it!
143426,1,These are great! I love them because they have the clear outer area. THe frosted ones are my second favorite but I hate the pacifiers that have so much color that all you see is this big plastic thing on their face. At least with these the color area is small.... and we like that it doesn't have the loop that can be pulled out more easily.
112456,1,real good. and they're comfortable and easy to use. what else can you say about diapers? no pee drips down his leg! actually... it's amazing how easy these are to use and how well they work. when you think about what our mothers had to work with... these are astonishing. he's happy. we're happy.
112469,1,These are the only diapers suited in fit for my granddaughter. Don't leak... hold more moisture that I would have ever thought possible overnight..... no need to change in the middle of the night or waking up to a wet mess.... wish they were available for my children.... Also love the fact that auto ship is available.... no running for diapers.... yeah!
21525,1,This product works fine with adjustments if you have a tub that is curved we had to do some modification. If you have a regular tub it would work great. It does keep your little one from the drain & faucets.
36903,1,Best blankie ever!!!Baby's r us dosn't carry these anymore have a different version just as comfy!But my daughter can notice the difference this is a must have!Washes well and very durable and soft!
42845,1,"This is a nice comfy stretchy wrap, your baby will love it. Despite what the instructions say veteran baby wearers know that stretchy wrap tend to get uncomfortable once the baby starts to get heavy, also, even though the instructions say you may wear your baby on your back in this wrap, as someone that has been babywearing for several years now, I am going to say IT IS NOT SAFE IN A STRETCHY WRAP!!! Your baby could lean back and fall out. If you want to do back carries in a wrap buy a woven wrap!This wrap molds around you baby and they will snuggle down in it and go to sleep! Which means you can still get done all the things busy parents need to do. I love this wrap for the first few months. Is do soft and snuggly.Comfy for both baby and parent."
43662,2,"Like the others, I am so disappointed in this product. I live in an apartment and was really anxious to have something so compact (since my home has been taken over by baby items) but I can't use it. As soon as I put my baby in the sling, the foot snap comes undone and folds up on my baby. This can't be safe!! And how are you supposed to hold this down and wash an infant at the same time?? We had to go buy a regular tub because I just couldn't use this product for my little one. Don't waste your money!!"
34706,0,"We bought this car seat for our 9 month old daughter when it was time to switch from the infant carrier. Rear-facing, the seat was very comfortable, but as other reviews say, quite large if you have a small car. When we switched it to forward facing, it is still very comfortable for her to play and sleep in for long trips. I also like that you can tighten and loosen the straps fairly easily. The one thing I don't like about the seat is that the buckle is a puzzle. I have to have a in-depth demonstration for my parents or in-laws each time they transport our daughter. Further, if our daughter is throwing a fit while we are trying to strap her in, it is quite difficult to get her buckled up. If I had it to do over again, I would probably buy a seat that is easier to buckle (though it is a comfortable, affordable seat)."
25624,2,"I have always been frustrated during the summer that I can't keep milk cold and fresh throughout the day for my daughter and would really prefer she not drink a ton of juice. So when I saw this product I was really excited. For about one week. Everything the other bad reviews say is true. It is very difficult to assemble in a way that won't leak. It is equally difficult to clean. And the sour milk smell that developed after a week of use (if you're out all day, the milk will eventually go bad) has made the cup totally unusable. I use a Thermos brand coffee thermos every day and don't have any of the same issues with that product. In fact, if they could just apply the assembly that they use on that mug to this cup they would probably have a perfect product. Until them, I am still in search of an insulated sippy cup. Don't waste your money on this one; it won't last long enough to be worth it."
62509,0,This product has worked with our 2 year-old daughter. I can't complain.
82471,0,"It looks very nice but it is a little flimsy. It took a little over an hour to assemble but I started it w/o my husband and got frustrated. After assembled, we found a strange 'crack/split' on the right side but it didn't affect anything and you can't see it unless you look for it so we decided to keep it. We bought it to use as a changing table/dresser and it will work fine for that, it just won't last forever."
89558,2,I ordered these after my baby grew out of Swaddlers which don't come in a size 4. Swaddlers were amazing! These are terrible. She leaked with every poop and had to be changed many more times during the day. I changed to cruisers and am once again happy with Pampers. I would definitely recommend cruisers!
37976,0,"This stroller handles well on sidewalks in the city, though I wouldn't recommend it as a straight ""jogging stroller"" because it does not have a safety tether. (The description says it has both a tether and a hand brake. It has neither.) I live in the city where the sidewalks are often broken and uneven. So far this stroller has handled the terrain pretty well. The swivel-wheel makes it very easy to steer. It's not too heavy, but it is a little top heavy. I have noticed it has a tendency to tip easily if I am moving across a grassy hill or something like that.The seat seems comfortable, and the harness is one of the best I have seen, a five-point number with an easy one-click release. The sunshade, however, doesn't really provide too much coverage for the child, and I wish it had a see-through window on top to provide a view of the rider. The space between the seat and the child's snack tray is kind of tight as well. My toddler fits fine at 18 months, but I am not sure that will be the case in another year.The handlebar is of average height, and it's covered with some kind of porous foam material that I am not particularly fond of. It's probably supposed to absorb moisture or something, but it's not the most comfortable thing in your hands.Parent's tray is okay, fine for keys and a phone, and it holds an small bottle of water tightly. The basket underneath is not particularly roomy, just average.Overall, a fine stroller for the money, just could use a few minor adjustments."
126240,1,"I've tried multiple brands (Pampers, Earth's Best, Kirkland, etc.) and Huggies are the best for our daughter. We've not had any leakage or blowouts."
63223,0,It went together easily.It is nice looking - looks good in the den.It's nice EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.If your child closes the top from the side (which my son has already done) they get their fingers caught as it closes.
103636,1,"These are much softer than the regular issue hard plastic shields. I prefer them because I think they are more comfortable. I did not notice any significant increase in milk output, but they are a great pair to have around because of comfort. I put mine in the top rack of the dishwasher a few times, too and they distorted a little but it didn't really affect their use."
78827,1,"I attached a Britax Marathon (the car seat shown in the product's image here on Amazon, actually) to my rolling carry-on using this strap and it was so easy to attach to the LATCH on the car seat. I was traveling alone with my 2 year old daughter; I put her in a stroller and pushed that with one hand while wheeling the luggage/car seat with the other. (It made me nervous to have her in the seat while it was attached to my luggage because I have a smaller-size rolling piece and her feet dragged on the ground.)Another great feature of this accessory is that you can just unclip the side LATCH snaps but leave the top strap attached to the seat(without it affecting the seat while in use on plane); that way, when you disembark you can more easily re-thread it through your carry-on's handle.And I LOVE how small the strap is: I keep it in my carry-on all the time so I don't lose it. I would recommend doing a test run using the strap on your luggage before your flight just to make sure you feel comfortable using it."
46553,1,"Bought a slat platform bed from pottery barn for my 2 year old and this is the only one that fits it. It was fairly inexpensive and easy to assemble and set up. The only downside is that it's a PITA to pull the sides down, but I guess that's a good thing considering it's meant to prohibit children from doing that while inside the bed."
73630,0,"I used this so much for the first 3 months of my baby's life. It was my go-to baby product and a life-saver for keeping track of his feedings. I didn't use the sleep and diaper buttons as much. The fourth ""open"" button was great to keep track of when I pumped milk or to keep track of any medicines my baby was on. However, two of the buttons suddenly stopped working after I'd been using this for just one month. As it was still under warranty, I sent it back to the manufacturer with the receipt. They sent me a new one. After a couple months of using this second one, some of the number characters have burnt out. So I can't see what time it is, for example. Even though it's a great idea and makes for a thoughtful, cute gift, the quality is VERY iffy. Don't buy this expecting to use if for very long."
133452,1,"I rarely write reviews but I had to comment on the fantastic customer service I received from Born Free. Like a lot of mothers, I recently switched from Avent to this BPA-free line of bottles by Born Free. I purchased 3 x 3 packs from a bricks and mortar retailer. The packets contained one venting system and a coupon for two more. The retailer was out of them and I am leaving for a trip at the end of the week. I emailed Born Free customer service. 48 hours later I am holding the vents in my hand, they also sent me some nipples, they overnighted everything (at their expense) so I could have them in time for my trip. I didn't know customer service like this existed any more. Overall, I am delighted with the product- fewer leaks than Avent, no concern about plastics, and my one year old took to the bottles like a duck to water. Highly recommended."
123591,1,"We bought this pack n play when our original one broke one time we were folding (trying to fold) it up. We didn't want the whole changing table portion, since our daughter is 1 now and is too big for that whole part.Boy were we impressed!!This pack n play is HUGE! It lets our little cruiser move around inside while keeping her safe so that I can work in the house. She loves all the toys on the sides and all the colors on the mat. She hates that she can't easily climb the sides of it.Folding and opening this pack n play are a breeze! Whatever you read about how easy this is to fold and open...believe it. I was nervous after how difficult our other one was to put away or assemble - but this one is amazing!Great product - no complaints!"
175691,0,"Ita okay, havent use it much as its very warm and I dont want my baby to be too hot- they always say dont over dress ur baby. Even in onsie its really warm to be in it all night. Baby sweats a lot in it"
23369,2,"So we got one of these for our first baby. It seemed like a really good idea at first, offering a filtration system, ability to use regular garbage bags... What more could a busy parent want???The unit uses a charcoal filtration pad, some 'D' sized batteries, and a little plastic plunger that is located on the inside of the lid that pushes the diapers past some plastic jaws that help contain the ""items"" and down into the bin.After the first couple of months, the first set of batteries died. No big deal, just replace them. Soon after, the ""dirty diaper smell"" started to emanate from the can. After changing the filter, about a week later one of the covers that holds the D batteries in place popped off and no matter what we tried to get it to stay in place (because it was responsible for the negative current on the batteries), short of actually gluing it in place, we couldn't get it to stay connected to the batteries. So at this point, no more air filtration system...The next problem came about when the plunger device that was connected to the inside of the lid came off in one of the diaper bags. Unfortunately for us, neither my wife or I noticed this and so the plunger was lost forever. Next failure came when the jaws that contain the ""items"" broke. At this point, one of the jaws still opens and closes, sort of, and the other stays closed unless we forcibly move it open.With all of this said, we still have the bin and our child is three and a half years old. But the bin is just that at this point, a bin with a lid that smells like diapers... Like I mentioned in the beginning, it would have been more cost effective to simply get a garbage bin..."
60914,2,"This is by far the worlds biggest waste of money. Who in their right mind would want to go through the hassles that this system has to offer. It's time consuming, doesn't hold many diapers, and for those of us with stinky diapers looming about its such a hassle. Walk the diaper out to the trash everyday and don't waste your money on the overpriced frills and expensive refills."
124048,2,"Originally, we were very happy with this stroller. It's lightweight, easy to use, and very convenient. Like another poster, our rear right wheel fell off for no known reason. At first, we wre pleased with the customer service, as it seemed we would be getting a replacement part right away. This was 5 weeks ago.We are STILL waiting for a replacement part for the rear right wheel. My wife has made several phone calls to Baby Trend's customer service number. Each time she calls, she is told something different. First call: ""It will be shipped right away."" Second call: ""Our warehouse just moved, so it took longer than we thought. It will ship on Friday or Monday."" Third call (to make sure it really shipped): ""It will go out Fed Ex on Wednesday (1 1/2 weeks later) with other shipments that have been delayed due to the move."" Fourth call: ""I see that it has shipped, but I can't determine whether it went out USPS or Fed Ex. I will check with my supervisor and call you back."" No call back. Fifth call: ""It shipped, and it went out USPS. The parts are too small to go out Fed Ex."" What?!!! My wife left a message on the supervisor's voice mail...two days later, still no call back. Sixth call, trying to reach the supervisor, but reached a service rep instead, who checked the account: ""I see that the parts went out Fed Ex. Here is the tracking number..."" Another message left with supervisor.We are completely frustrated by the incompetence of the customer service department. Trying to reach anyone has been a challenge. There has been a wait time of about 10 minutes each time my wife tries to call. In addition to the phone calls, my wife has used the Baby Trend website to email questions and concerns. As of this evening there has been no reply. One was sent a few days ago, the other a couple of weeks ago. When she asked the service rep about the email, she was told there is typically a response within 48 hours.Although this product was fantastic before the cheap-o plastic wheel broke, we STRONGLY CAUTION anyone before purchasing this product. If anything goes wrong with it, expect to not have it in use for OVER A MONTH!!!"
46211,1,This is all we use for nights. I used this with my twins and now my singleton - nothing else could hold us through the nights.
85800,1,super product - i have asthma and i find it somewhat difficult to bend in order to wash my legs - this grip is awsome as it adhere very well to the tiles without fear of it coming off. thanx for this - makes my everyday life a whole lot easier
32819,1,"My husband and I purchased this carrier before we traveled for the first time with our 4 1/2 month old son. We were going on a cruise and thought a carrier might be easier than a stroller. I had received a Snugli as a baby shower gift; it was uncomfortable to wear and our son seemed cramped in it (at 4 1/2 months he was almost 16 pounds). After reading reviews, we decided to purchase the Baby Bjorn. We abslolutely love it and think it is well worth the money. I had no problems putting my son in or taking him out by myself. I found it easy to put on and adjust. (Take the time to read the manual to make sure you know how to use it properly first.) My son slept comfortably in it; and I could take him out and put him down while he was still asleep. I wore it to dinner and was comfortable eating with my son in my lap. The only thing I didn't master was nursing my son while he was in the carrier, but it was easy enough to get him out even while seated on the plane. If you're looking to purchase a carrier, give this one a try; you'll be happy you did!"
146385,0,"Overall it is a good, but not excellent, product. But I was very disappointed that the bee sitting on the left has a defect and could not stand straight. The base appears to have eroded. It must be a quality thing."
29143,1,"Definitely recommend if your looking for a ""step up"" for your little ones. I use it in the bathroom and it's the perfect height. It's very secure and safe with the rubber material on the top and bottom."
124294,2,"Title says it all. Broke in less than 2 weeks. Even before it broke, I had to install it on the very end of the toilet in order for the lid not to open far enough for a little hand and arm to go in and then you had this big thing between your legs while using the toilet. I have replaced it with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IP8RRM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title and love these (have them on drawers and the toilet)."
93802,2,"I really am not happy with this gate. It is hard to open, takes two hands, and just seems cheaply made. It doesn't slide easily, so if you don't have all the panels open, watch that it doesn't pinch your figers!Spend a bit more money and get a different gate, this was one of the only ones at the store when I bought it. I wish I had waited."
137276,2,"I chose this stroller for the Britax name (good quality), and because I needed a stroller that was lightweight and not too expensive (keeping it at my parents' place in Maine). In general I think it's all right, but it's quite annoying to open and close, and the handles aren't really high enough (but I think this is a problem with many strollers). My main complaint is that the back doesn't go upright enough, so my son has to be half-way reclined when he's in it. It doesn't look very comfortable for him, and he much prefers his usual stroller that has 3 positions, including one that is bolt upright. This stroller has 2, and the lying-down position is fine when he's sleeping, I just wish the ""upright"" position was actually upright."
47734,2,"the sleeping wedge is a waste of money. my 4 month old had an issue with coughing at night. this was recemmended to us as a possible solution. however, the wedge simply made him roll sideways down the crib and was never effective. also, since the foam comes in two pieces and the case for it zips up the seam in the middle, there seemed to be a bit of a gap in the middle of the ""pillow"". this did not work for us and was a waste of money and hope."
106769,1,"I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it! I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie. It was such a pain to use. We all hated it. The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use. And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills. It takes regular trash bags. I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch. And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did! If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!"
42000,1,"I took the side attachments off (it's great to have that flexibility with the product) and just use it to store diapers and have the wipes warmer sitting on top. It's convenient and easy and saves space, which is a premium in my world!"
154803,2,"I really liked the way this potty looked, so I bought it for my daughter. I waited a week for it and was so excited when it finally got here and that was the end of my good thoughts. The height ring kept falling off everytime we moved the potty and so did the grippers. The grippers just stick on the bottom and the potty just sits on the height ring. The back compartment slid off if you tried to pick it up and the interior shelf was bent. Also, the top to the ""tank"" compartment was bent and didn't sit on the back of the potty well. The free liners seemed more like a hammock that would not do a good job of catching the potty. I quickly took it back apart and returned it."
51130,1,"My wife loves her Snoogle! She has been sleeping much more comfortably with it. She is now 19 weeks and we have had it for about 4 weeks. It was a great decision, we highly recommend it to others!"
25947,1,"While this kit is common-sense (as previous reviewers have indicated), I like the concept that everything is spelled out & handy. I learn best by watching others & having all the information available at my fingertips.This kit promotes sensible eating. I don't buy prepared food such as frozen entrees & TV dinners for my husband and me, so why should I for my precious baby. As adults, we know fresh is best for us & it is no different for the smallest member of our family.It is also economical. It cost me $.91 to make 29 oz of sweet potatoes. Purchasing 5 oz of already prepared baby food cost me $1.18. It's a great feeling filling up the trays knowing your baby will be eating healthy, preservative-free food while keeping $$ in your pocket."
91537,2,"I bought this item before I had my daughter thinking it would be a great product. Boy was I WRONG! It hardly ever works on either channel, the static is defening. I have a better chance of hearing my daughter crying without the monitor on. The receivers will work in some rooms but not in other. If I could go back I would definitly pick something else. I am due to have another baby in a few months and I will definitly be buying a different brand of monitor, maybe I will be lucky and get one that works this time."
143788,2,"The area where the screws go into the woood was broken in two places, looks like when they disassembled the gate they had problems and just stuffed it in a box. This item shouldn't have cost more than $40 tops. Very disappointed."
13580,2,"When we took our pieces out of the box, we noticed that two of the three boards were warped. Now, we live in Ma. It's not that hot up here, around 85 degrees today. Three of us tried to slide the boards into the slots they were supposed to go into. I'm sure that once you can get it together it's great for space, but don't try to put it together if it's warm out!"
70238,2,"I bought this double stroller a few years ago when I had my second child. I used it a few times at the beginning, and it was very irritating the way the wheels dug in so I could not maneuver the stroller at all. TERRIBLE for shopping or anywhere you will be stop and go, also TERRIBLE if you will be going over any cracks or bumps at all on the road. So basically terrible. It's actually easier to chase my kids around than to try to use the stroller.As my child grew bigger the problem got worse and it is totally unusable.it can't handle weight beyond newborns? Come on, Peg Perego.Now I'm about to have my third child. I was expecting this stroller to last. knowing how terrible it is I can not in good conscience sell this stroller to make money and buy a new one. I am in an extremely tight financial situation and I can not buy another double stroller, even a cheaper one used.Thanks a lot, Peg Perego."
1837,1,"The pampers baby dry are very good diapers, as they hold a ton of moisture, but sometimes don't do very well with semi-solids..When you have moist #2's, they seem to become a mess quick with these (smear on the legs, etc.), but again, to me it's a decent trade off, since in most situations these are far better than the competition. I definitely recommend them, especially if you have a baby who pees a lot in his/her sleep, as they are the ONLY diapers that seem to hold up to heavy amounts of pee without leaking all over the place..."
25180,0,"We bought this for our twins and it's fine as far as potties go, but not for what we paid. My kids don't care about the music (that tends to go off when no one is around the potty). They figured out how to make it play by pushing the button within the first day of having it. I finally took the music box thing out.It's a pain to clean too. There are so many nooks and crannies. The part they step on gets really dirty and it has holes in it where dirt and dust settles.Save yourself some money and buy a basic potty chair-I wish we had."
91114,0,"When registering for baby products, I researched baby carriers at length. I decided to go for the Snugli, because I couldn't see how the Bjorn could be worth the extra money. I really, really wanted the Snugli to work, since it was so afforable compared to the Bjorn. Unfortunately, my daughter would only tolerate the Snugli for about 15 minutes before screaming. She wanted to face forward at 2 months of age when her head control was pretty good, but the when we tried it, her head was too far down in the Snugli to enjoy it. So, I sucked it up and got the Bjorn. And, *sigh* she loves it. We walk around for hours, and she is content. The quality in the construction is far superior to the Snugli. The padding is great in it, and you can get your baby up high and tight on your chest, so your baby (and you) feels secure. Also, my baby doesn't flop around in the Bjorn like she did the Snugli. A major drawback is that the Snugli isn't adjustable for baby's length like the Bjorn. I'm pretty frugal, but I think you get what you pay for in this department. However, as long as your baby likes the Snugli, go for it! But, I'd keep the receipt around just in case."
22973,1,I really love this set especially the spoons I think my daughter loves to bite on the spoons more than eating her spoons I wish they were sold in a big pack. The bowl is very durable and the cup is very nice as well. Very nice set.
40513,1,"These diapers are wonderful. My daughter and her husband have eleven months old triplets, two boys and one girl. We use these diapers because the soft elastic does not mark their little thighs and they absorb the wetness without irritating their delicate skin.Thank you.Grandma Mare"
34815,1,"I was looking for a car seat that my 14 mth old son could transition to. I was also looking for something that would be a one time purchase that could grow with him. I found this in the Cosco Elite. Car seat has plkenty of cushion for support, material is soft and durable. my son love the removable cup hold( makes him feel like a big boy).Overall this was a good buy"
30554,0,This bath was great when my son was a newborn with the hammock attachment so that he is mostly out of the water and a comfortable place to put his head. I usually put a warm washcloth over his belly and periodically poured warm water over it to keep him warm. Once my son got over the 10 pound mark I took down the other side of the hammock so his body was halfway immersed in the water. The 'bump stop' does as it should and he doesn't slide into the water but it leaves a deep red mark because of his weight. I am sure once he is able to sit up this bathtub will be great but it's very upsetting to see the mark on his back and I know it has got to be uncomfortable because of how much he squirms.
42058,1,"My mother saw this toy while shopping it was so cheap she figured even if the baby doesn't like it won't really matter. We didn't think my daughter would like it as much as she does. My baby is only two and a half months but if I help her grab it she'll play with it for hours, looking at it and trying to get it in her mouth. It's soft too, so if my baby accidently hits herself with it it won't hurt. For the price, this is a must have."
24590,1,"I read the reviews from Amazon on this gate a decided to purchase it based on them. My only concern was the pedals breaking. When I got the gate, I saw that they had replaced the pedal with a heavier duty one. I put the gate up, (easy install) and have had no problems. My daughter is ten months and 23 lbs. This gate is a savior from us running down the hall every 30 seconds."
131459,1,This slip cover is perfect for a boy or girl. It washes easily and fits perfectly over the Bare Naked Boppy pillow. I bought it to go in my Nemo themed nursery and it is perfect in there!
14033,2,"These bottles were recommended to me, but unfortunately my experience with them was never good with both the 4oz and 9oz bottles. The bottles LEAK when you're shaking the formula, on your baby, and in the diaper bag if not in an upright position. I thought that the problem was with one bad bottle but it keeps happenig - after bying all the accessories for it I find myself looking for new bottles. I gave it a good try, my baby is almost 4 months old but it hasn't been worth it."
136781,1,"I have had 6 children and this is the best toy for a small baby i have ever ever bought!!! Not only does it keep him amused and happy, but my 2 year old sits beside him and lovessssss it too. I am going to get my newborn nephew this for christmas! You couldnt buy a better crib toy. We hook it to the bed, the swing, the exosaucer!! The best best best.. I love leap frog!!!!"
143296,1,"HAVE NOT USED THEM JET, BUT PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE GONING TO BE REALLY NECESARY WHEN WASHING THOSE HARD TO WASH DR BROWNS BOTTLES. I PLAN ON TAKING ONE ON MY DIAPER BAG FOR WHEN WASHING ON THE GO."
64681,1,My 4mnts old loves it. Colorful and easy to hold. I strongly recommend it. it will keep my little one entertain for a while!
10529,1,"I find these cloth diapers very useful. I use them as burp cloths and to have handy in case of spills or other baby related messes. They are absorbent and comfortable to use. They are soft, so they don't scratch my babies face when I clean his mouth. I first bought 1 package and then went back for more. They are inexpensive and very useful."
24192,1,"I LOVE this swing and so does my baby boy. He has been using it since the week he came home. He is 4 1/2 months old and still enjoys falling asleep in it. I agree with the other people who mentioned the mobile of bears fading into the background...but my baby isn't as interested in the bears now that he is getting older, so I just took that part off. I like that the music keeps playing and that I can turn the volume down. It seems to keep us both happy :-). I highly recommend this product and very happy we bought it. If you are looking for a portable swing this wouldn't be a good option for you; Although, my husband and I have carried it up and down the stairs several times (sans baby) and seem to do it with little difficulty---just have to be creative in the way you carry it. Still running on same batteries!!!!!!"
3821,0,"We received this gym mat for free, and it was worth every penny!Though our son liked lying on his back and looking at the various dangling parts of this gym mat, he is outgrowing it fairly quickly. The musical ball is nice because the music is not annoying. However, I am not sure that a baby could spin the ball fast enough to activate it by himself. Once a baby becomes more mobile, his arms flail out beyond the soft part of the mat toward the hard plastic edges.A bigger mat will last a longer time and offer more stimuli for the baby."
143889,1,This is the best item to save wear and tear on the backs of seats due to kids feet. Even if its unintentional kids always push on the back of the seat with dirty shoes/feet/ This keeps the back clean and free of tearing fabric. I love it!
153269,2,"We bought this clock for our daughter's room. It kept time for the first couple of weeks, but then appeared to stop. We replaced the battery, thinking it might have been an old battery and reset it. The clock kept time for about a week and then lost about an hour a day. We kept trying to reset it, but the clock continued to keep bad time. I replaced the battery one last time, but no luck. I would not recommend buying this clock at all. Looks nice, but just doesn't work. It is a waste of money."
128316,0,"I was frustrated with this seat when I first started using it for my daughter. It took some getting used to lining up the seat so that the rubber grips would keep it from sliding. Once we figured that out, it's worked great and for a long time my daughter preferred it to her on the floor potty at home. I found that it works better a long narrow toilet seat which probably keeps it from giving as much as on a wider, rounder seat. Also, my daughter is only 25lbs. So for us, it works great for trips to the store."
136420,1,"WE RECEIVED THIS PIECE A FEW MONTHS AGO. OVERALL I LIKE IT IN ALL,ON OURS YOU HAD TO SCREW IN THE BACK WITH LIKE A MILLION SCREWS. BUT I KNOW IT WILL LAST"
79017,1,"This is a good product if you use the Dr. Brown's bottles. will fit 13 bottles if you don't dry the caps on it, and don't mind a little ""puzzle"" work to fit everything in, otherwise will fit 8-10 with all pieces (caps also) without much trouble."
161983,2,Received as a shower gift. Used it without leaking 2 times... since then anytime I tried to give my son a bath the water would leak out. Bought a no name brand one for $12.99 @ Walmart and its much better and has the slide built in.Not like the mesh that with a active 3 month old will wobble.This is not a good tub. Opt for something else.Water leaks and mesh will not withstand a wiggley active baby.
68055,0,"I purchased it for my trip to Europe. I travelled with my 11 months old son who didn't stand or walk on his own. So after first 9 hour flight i had hand luggage, baby on my hands plus i had to dig through the pile of strollers to get mine and take that bag off to put the baby in. Well :((( the bag is ok, but you need extra hands. So if you travel alone with baby, it's just extra hussle. I didn't use it any more and my stroller was perfectly fine."
161078,1,If it wasn't for another person's review and cleaning solution I would have given this only 3 stars! I am disappointed to find there are no replacement bags for this. It is a fantastic product and I will be buying more to give away as gifts! With the following information of course (I found an easy way to clean the mesh part that I would like to share with every one. First- remove any large pieces of pulp or food left inside- don't worry about scrubbing it out or removing all the food. Second- mix 1/4 a scoop of an oxi-clean type cleaner with hot water in glass cup. Third- put the mesh bag in the glass- ring side up (you can hold it down with a spoon). Wait about 10 minutes. Pull the mesh bag out- rinse and clean with regular dish washing soap. Air dry. Mesh bag comes out sparkling white (so will your glasses if you have hard water stains!). The food simply disolves. Works really well with bananas!!!! No more brown colored mesh. No more time spent trying to pull small bits of food out from the mesh edges or from around the ring. )
135287,1,"It help me a lot to nurse my baby, setting my hands free entirely!And it also a great support for baby to lean."
165114,1,"Everyone has the diapers they swear by. This work great like the cruisers, but for some reason my daughter tends to get a little red (early stage of rash) when wearing these and we don't get the red with cruisers."
172784,0,"Good points:1. the shower is soothing for my newborn2. the tub is portable and the handle turn into a hook for easy hang dry3. the mat is at a perfect angle to wash baby's head and then the bodyBad points:1. the push button for the shower is not at a good spot, which makes it a little difficult when doing showers alone2. the temperature gauge on the side of the shower is difficult to read"
54161,1,"When my son was about 6 weeks old we bought this for him. He loved looking at it and he would watch it with his little legs kicking away. This was such a help for me, it was the only way that I could do anything when he was born. I would place my son in his crib and play the mobile and voila I had a few minutes to do the dishes or pick up my home or wash up. I loved this mobile so much (as did my son) that I bought it for 3 friends that were having babies as well. Also the music was excellent and had a rich tone. There was also a high or low feature which helped control the volume a bit. I spent 40.00 for this and I would have spent 100 if I had to. We used this several times a day until he was 6 mos old."
148299,1,"This potty is one of the most simple and efficient designs I've seen! I've been using it for a couple months now for my 4 month old and she just loves to sit on it -(with help, of course:). It has no folding or opening parts to break or get pinched on, just one piece. (We were using a regular potty chair, (SafetyFirst), and just about everytime we used it the darn thing fell apart in some way or another, emptying it was another story!) The splash guard works great, also good for holding baby up, and the seat is smooth with a great shape for little bums. It also is nice for traveling if you have a place to empty it, though for traveling I use a seat that takes a bag. Another thing I love about it is that my older children, (3-5), can easily empty it when they're trying to help. I would recommend this potty to anyone and everyone with a baby, especially if doing early training."
179251,0,"My wife and I just purchased a single stage 2 bottle to try it out on our 3 month old. The package is very vague about how to use and I had to laugh when I saw that you couldn't use in a steamer to sterilize. We've determined that Playtex should really test their products before putting them out on the shelf for first time parent consumers. I've only used the bottle twice now, and it seems to work okay. How long? We'll have to see about that...When we opened the package and boiled all the parts, my curiousity got the best of me. Needless to say, I decided to put myself in the baby's shoes and test it out myself with water. After filling and closing all the lids, I attempted to draw the water from the nipple. Yip. The majority of these reviews are correct! Your baby will need to be able to suck chrome off a bumper to get anything out. However, I found a simple solution. With your index finger and thumb, squeeze and roll the tip of the nipple several times. This allows the nipple hole to crack it's sticky silicon seal. I guess when these bottles are manufactured, the silicon rubber tends to stick together resulting in the hole sealing itself. This is also true with the one-way rubber seal that allows air to pass through and not the liquid. It appears as though this silicon rubber material needs to be &quot;broken in&quot; before it can work effectively. It's silicon rubber, don't be afraid to stretch it out a little to break it in. Hopefully this will help many of you whom have purchased and having the same problems with the flow issue. I got so frustrated trying it out myself that I was ready to walk up to the Playtex corporate offices and picket against all their baby products. Best wishes to all."
7491,1,"Excellent - much better than a bulky travel system. And it does fit the Graco SnugRide very safely- that's what my daughter is in. One tip - always use the safety strap to secure the seat. Otherwise, if you are removing bulky items from the basket below, it could tip the seat. (This never happened - but I noticed that it potentially might.)"
153036,1,"I tried a few different level-door locks to prevent our two-year old from gaining entry into unwanted places. This was truly the onlydoor lock that worked. The fact that it looks nice is a bonus. I highly recommend this door latch. The others for lever handles, simply do notwork. I give this product 5-starts! Good job!A Father and handyman."
178282,1,I found the double zipper feature critical. I also liked that I could label/date the bags without writing over the storage area of the bag.
20284,0,"I liked the bottles for travel because the nipple fit the same as drop-ins, which were my main bottles, but some of these bottles leaked. I don't know why, only one leaked, and the other two didn't. I liked the bottles but was just annoyed by the leaking one."
11049,1,"We bought this seat three years ago for my then 18 month old. Now, at five, she stil uses it every night at dinner. I am now going to buy one for my second daughter and as I was reading the reviews I was surprised that so many people had trouble with cracks or smells, or even cleaning it. This seat has been nothing but easy and fantastic for us, so much so that I have to buy a second one because my five year old won't pass it down to my one year old."
101238,0,I bought the Pampers Baby dry count 246 but it is not up to the expectations.Better to by Pamper Swaddles
61681,1,Pretty good monitor for the price. It makes an annoying noise sometimes that I can't figure out - like static. But overall we use this monitor when we travel and it works well
102692,1,"This is one of the best mobiles out there! My 5 week old infant girl just loves starring at it during her wake time. She kicks and arms move so fast while watching this mobile. Love the pre-set (Beethoven, Mozart, ect.,)music or rainforest sounds, so does she!"
43598,0,I checked on the Kido website (kidcoinc.com) and this model fits openings 28&quot; to 36&quot; wide. An optional extension kit exists which measures 5.5&quot; (available on this webiste). The gate plus extensions can be combined for a maximum length of 47&quot;.
69541,0,"these are adorable letters, but don't miss that they are only a couple inches in size. i returned them because they sent his first letter w/o the other two, but nonetheless wanted letters that were the ""typical"" size you see in stores, about 6 inches."
104254,1,This product serves its purpose and has held up quite nicely. It is a little difficult to cut and place if you have an irregular height banister. If you do not have to cut off the top of the product it will be much easier to install.
64057,1,"When my wife and I searched for a baby tub for our newborn (9 lbs. 2 oz.), we could not find one large enough to accommodate our big boy past 6 months of age. All of the baby tubs offered by the popular stores were far too small, but we settled at the time. After 6 months, the standard sized baby tubs were too small and we searched for a replacement. This Euro Bath tub is PERFECT and well worth the money! It hold infants firmly in place while bathing and can easily accommodate a 2 year old toddler. Our son is now 21 months old (32 lbs.) and still likes the Euro Bath tub. We still like it because it can be filled up quickly with very little water compared to a standard sized built in tub. It's also very easy to drain, keep clean and dry/store. My wife and I highly recommend this Euro Bath tub for any parent with an infant or young toddler."
157687,1,Pretty print. Easy to use. The twins slept so comfortable in it. I got tons of compliments when people saw my babies wearing them. So worth every penny!
108794,1,"My first son's head never smelled good. I wanted to embrace that whole ""his head smells so good!"" thing but he always smelled like a dirty pillow case to me. And at 2-3 months he developed nasty cradle cap. My girls' heads DID smell good... and they never had cradle cap. Now I am on my 4th child and his head does not smell good. I am working on a theory that oily-smelling babies are more prone to cradle cap... we will see, At any rate I posted on a mommy board about this odd problem and one mom said she used this to make her oily-smelling kid smell good - so I gave it a try. I have used it twice now and my son's head now smells like... nothing. Pure, clean, nothing. Whether or not it will truly keep cradle cap at bay, I don't know yet. But it's the only thing that makes my son's head smell good and that's something for now! I love how it's foam and easy to rinse, but am told it is not tear free so you have to be careful with it. My son is only 5 weeks so still at that stage where baths take just a few minutes in the kitchen sink so it's easy to keep out of his eyes - might be harder with a bigger child."
131223,0,"Overall we're happy with the quality for the money, but it arrived with one very noticeable scratch on the edging that goes around the changing pad and several other small scratches on the front. but we had a ridiculous time with the shipping on this thing (not sure if it was Amazon or UPS' fault) that we didn't bother with trying to ship it back. haven't really started to use it yet, so we'll see how long it holds up for!"
120726,1,"This is the first gate I've a purchased in 20+ years and wow...how the technology has changed. IF you want a gate that opens in both directions and closes behind you so that your ""child"" (human or animal) doesn't escape behind you--this IS your gate! It MUST sit flat on the ground (why would you want it any other way???) per the manufacturer's instructions. And, as one previous reviewer noted, it would be nice to have a feature/setting where the gate COULD stay in the open position. I'm just using an antique door stop and it works just fine. Installation was easy and I got the black finish which sort of just lets the gate ""disappear"" into the background. The price on Amazon is attractive too. IF you are contemplating a gate purchase, this one is worth the extra money."
140985,2,"Material is too thin to look nice. When the sun is shining, you can't even see the design. Seems to be nicely constructed otherwise, but just doesn't look that nice."
113375,2,"Unless you are listening for static instead of a crying baby, I suggest passing on this product!!! It worked great for the first few months but after that you could only hear static"
95071,2,I received this pump as a replacement from Medela because my Delux Single had broken and been discontinued by the company. I HATE IT! The pump is sooo slow and pulls almost no milk out. I know i am not the problem because i was able to get a couple of oz out with each session on my other pump. Save your money and go with something else!
82999,1,"This blanket was not only reasonably priced, but is so soft and washes well. My grandson cuddled up in it and loves it, the color is different than the usual baby colors and I really am happy about my purchase. If you like orange and soft and practical, get this blanket, it is worth every penny!"
69065,0,"A little slow on shipping since I qualify for free shipping. However, the fact that you receive these via post is great. Saves another trip to the store."
109214,1,These ere out of stock at my local Target. I'm glad I found them on Amazon. Fit snug on the Bumbo. Works great!
93100,1,"I love these cots! I watch children in my home and use these for nap time. I was nervous about buying them after reading some of the reviews - sheet is too tight, children find them uncomfortable, etc. - but have had no problems with them. I love that it comes with a washable sheet, they are easy to open and close for storing away until nap time, and the kids (ages 2 and 3) nap just fine on them. Though I haven't tried them myself, it seems to me like it would be more comfortable than a thin mat on the floor. I've had them for a few months now and have no complaints!"
94316,0,"im still debating whether or not i really like these bottles. Recently, i've notice the bottles leak alot when I would test the temperture on my wrist.But the nipple works great with my daughter and they do well on the gas department."
163552,0,"I can honestly say I was totally in love with this highchair when I first purchased it. It is a great highchair until they are around a year old..if that. It depends on how big your child is but mine out grew it pretty quickly, I was upset since I had a beautiful high chair that was full size and I sold it when I purchased this item. I ended up selling this item and purchasing another full size high chair. If you want a nice high chair I would totally recommend the fisher price rainforst or even the aquarium, they are both awesome chairs! And my 3 year old can still fit in them!"
144976,1,"nice product, convenient that it includes 3 different color ribbons so you can customize the baskets to whatever color you want. Average price. I used one basket to hold the items I bought for a baby shower - it made a nice appearance and the mother to be can use the basket for miscellaneous baby items."
8800,1,"We have a vintage 1950's kitchen dinette set with the original vinyl covering on the chairs. The hard plastic booster we were using was leaving permanent dents in the vinyl, so I bought this booster in hopes of remedying the problem. I also wanted our son, now 2, to have a more comfortable seat at meal times. This seat instantly reduced dinner-time squirming and the vinyl on the chairs is back to normal. I also love the fact that this seat does not need to be buckled to the chair so we can easily move it when needed. Clean up is a snap, too. I rinse it off in the sink with a little mild soapy water, towel dry and it's back in place. I'll be giving this as a baby shower gift from now on. Don't waste your money on other boosters."
61020,1,"This product is worth the money, no smells, the refills are high in price but its so worth it, I say it is one of the top ten things mom should get for their baby."
163606,2,"I loved this product before I bought it. Now that it's in use, I don't care for it at all. With the curved design, any food that slips under the tray, gets UNDER my child somehow! I always need to brush off his bottom after he eats! (And not because he moves around). I took off the cover for this reason, since it's washable, but not wipable. First time mommies: you want a chair you can wipe out! The tray is dishwasher safe, which would be a great feature if it fit in the dishwasher! The base is very large and makes the seat sit forward in the chair, meaning another place to clean, since you can see behind the chair. (The back of the seat is 6 inches ahead of the chair.) I did daycare for 7 years and may just go back to my little Safety First $17 seat. It performed much better and the tray could fit in the dishwasher. The things I like about this chair: the cover (which I now don't use since it's always messy) and the tray that can be put on/off with one hand or with 2. I don't think I can stand using this chair for another year!"
78918,0,"I just got back from a trip where we used this extensively. I have to say, in retrospect, I should have spent the $80 on the GoGo Travelmate and got that. To set this up and take it down so many times is a pain: set it up once in the airport, take it off at security, set it up again after security, take it off again at the plane. With 2 flights each way to our destination, we had enough of this. More importantly, there is no ""requirement"" stated anywhere on the carry on size. We had a smaller carry on with a duffel bag on top. We had to unhook the whole setup another 2 times to get stuff out of the duffel bag. Also, this combination didn't make it very stable and the car seat was slightly tilted the whole time. But given that only straps were holding it in place, it is difficult for it to stay very firm anyway. At one point, the entire thing flung to the side and slammed against the elevator door as we were getting in... with my daughter in it, fast asleep. The car seat frame protected her and she didn't hit her face but she came very, very close. She did jam her foot though between the car seat and the elevator door frame. All this because the weight shifted as we were wheeling her along. This is OK to use for a 1-leg trip (just 1 flight, no changes, etc), and if you have a large carry on with you. Otherwise, skip it."
30328,1,"These rails worked perfectly and were about $40 cheaper here than on the company website. Yes you will need a boxspring or to nail additional boards horizontally to have the mattress fit, but I'm not sure what people were expecting? I was angry at having to buy them at all because the conversion crib we bought for our daughter in 2007 came with everything and 3 years later my sons bed didn't so we had to buy these, but that is what it is. They fit great and the whole conversion from day bed to full size bed took about 45 minutes."
44441,1,I love this bed rail! It is versatile. Goes on many different sizes of beds. Strong! Takes the worry out of my toddler sleeping by himself. Now I know he won't fall out of bed.
33378,0,I don't like how it shows through your clothing. Not discreet at all! It does do a good job of holding your milk.
95313,1,I bought and returned almost every monitor in the store. After the second or third time of returning I was going to give up but decided to buy the two that were rated the higest on this site. This one and the First Years Crisp N' Clear. I found that the Crisp and Clear to have just as much static as the other models. I was told that the reason that Fisher Price Sounds N' Lights is so clear (I do not get any static) is because it is less than 900mhz so you are not on the busy cordless and cell phone and radio frequencies. It is too low to pick up anything but your baby -- I was suprised that it also picked up my baby breathing from the other side of the house. It is a bonus that the best is also the cheapest!
