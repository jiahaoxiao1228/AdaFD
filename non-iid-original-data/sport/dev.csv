249199,1,"A-OK, IF YOU NEED A 22LR LOADER FOR YOUR HAND GUN THIS IS ONE TO BUY, IT WORKS, AND CAN BE USED IN THE FIELD."
131058,0,"These lugs crimp okay but no better than others and are not 100%. I had to crimp using the proper tool several times on one of the lugs out of four in order to get it to hold sufficiently. I am not an expert at crimping heavy gauge wire, but have enough experience to not expect to have had this issue."
320713,0,"Three stars for a belt that works. The closure method for this belt is velcro, where the free end goes through the buckle and back over top of the belt. The belt end has a velcro hook section and then a long section of velcro loop. The sizing is tough for the 36ish waist. Determine your use before ordering. Medium will work but will not permit ITW holsters; there is not enough length to get over the holster. Large provides plenty of length but the method of closure makes right-side belt platforms awkward due to the doubling over for closure. This is a good quality belt that is nice to use if it is sized correctly. A Cobra buckle would put this belt to 5 stars."
25189,0,"I bought this for the price...The rope was too thick so I replaced it with a thinner one I had laying around. Then it was usable, before that it would twist up and shorten even though it has bearings."
118958,1,"Well, the first reviewer seems a little put out and unrealistic. The coasters are tin and the bases are made of cork not wood. Dropping the coaster onto a glass table top would not nick the glass by any stretch of the imagination. Any smooth surface coaster will adhere to the bottom of a glass/can/etc when it sweats are is wet. Many bartenders will sprinkle a little salt onto a coaster for this very reason or when using a frosted glass. For the price the coasters look awesome and perform as expected. The collector tin they come in is awesome. I use it like a candy dish and stack the coasters by themselves."
43165,2,"I recently purchased this as a daily beater watch that can be worn to work. I read the reviews and had some concern with the automatic but decided to take my chances. Now I am preparing to box it back up to send back. This morning was the 4th time I had to reset the watch in just two weeks. This is with fairly steady usage. However, if you don't wear it one day, then it will stop. That defeats any practicality for this watch. Today was the second time where it didn't make it overnight- the kinetic storage for this is just too small.That being said, I like the looks and style, build quality seems fine (other than the automatic function). I am taking the return money and getting the quartz version so I can have a watch that does something radical.. tell you the time when you pick it up off the table."
117350,0,"I read such rave reviews about this product before purchasing, but was a bit disappointed.1. Child must wear a bike helmet. The seat is not so sturdy, and if god forbid you crash into something, the baby goes flying.2. Definitely not recommended for any baby that does not hold his head. Baby must be able to sit without assistance. Seat has zero head support.3. Not safe for mountain biking.It is easy to install, but really not for major biking excursions."
271700,0,"I like the tee as it is sturdy. But, I don't like the small imprinted emblem on the sleeve near the cuff as it clashes with some things I want to wear the tee with."
412668,1,"I work overnights and do tons of documentation. Having a watch that helps me keep track of the date (it changes during my shift) and the day of the week (which gets lost in the shuffle when you work nights) as well as military time makes note writing a snap. And I cannot abide without a second hand - which is rare bird with a digital watch. The illumination of the digits as well as the glowing hands are plenty in a darkened patient's room. And it has so far stood up to more dunkings and hand washings than I care to count. I've banged the crystal on door frames and bed rails without any damage and without band clasp release.Additionally...I have tiny girl wrists, and while it isn't a small watch, it isn't a huge monster on my arm either and have had no issue getting the extra links taken out of the band for a perfect fit.Highly recommended."
204369,2,"While I was amazed to find that I was sent the right COLOR and SIZE, I was not too happy to find that the inside of the waist band WAS NOT covered in cloth and that the elastic pinched and rubbed. Not too good of a sensation."
70308,0,"The fenders seem to be a good fit (size, positioning over wheels), however the mounting hardware included with the fenders assumes the tube sizes are thicker than my bike (2003 Gary Fisher Advance) as using the included bolts and nuts results in the fenders not being tightly adhered to the bike frame, but instead hanging loosely creating an unsafe riding situation. Using some spare bolts and nuts solves the problem."
292758,1,These gloves are comfortable and stretch nicely to my hand and I like the choice of colors. They don't last too long if you play golf a lot.at the start of the golf season (I live in the northern midwest) I buy myself and my two sisters gloves in varying colors and it lasts through to the fall. It's difficult to find ladies gloves that aren't white.
230939,0,"The product is just as described and has a quality that appears to be worth the price it is sold for. I have no complaints about the product or seller, but would like to share my story. (Note: The chrome variety with the pouch is the nicest because it becomes more silenced when its pouch then the blue/yellow/red styles that do not have a pouch. I have all 4.)I purchased these bells for my children right before a trip to Yellowstone National Park. Before I had the opportunity to use them I read reviews about the possibility of the ringing bells inspiring curiosity in the minds of bears and other animals, therefore attracting them.For example, ""The responses of grizzly bears to the sound of bear bells has not been studied experimentally. However, there have been rumors of data collected which indicate that hikers wearing ""bear bells"" have reported seeing more bears. Possibly due to curiosity, if in fact this data exists ([...]).""I realize hat bashing the bear bell could be a scare tactic to sell more bear spray, but it worked on me and I could not brave the idea of strapping theses bells on my kids. I left them in the truck the whole time we were in YNP. Luckily no dangerous bear encounters to report, but we did spot a grizzly and 2 cubs in the distance. Hopefully this helps, Good Luck!"
344625,0,"This is a nice product, just be careful with the sizing. My son wears a size 12 jeans and weighs about 90 pounds, he needs a size medium pants. I had trouble finding the sizing chart and ordered the wrong size. Also, the belt isn't a ""true"" belt in that it doesn't go all the way around the pants so you can't buy a larger size and just tighten the waist."
74266,2,"Sadly, i was not at all satisfied with the Thermarest Compressible Pillow. First of all the product arrived in the shipping box with no wrapping, who knows wheres its been dropped or dragged. Second, after unrolling it, it didnt fluff up at all. I had to shake it and beat to get it to fluff up about half way. It feels like its stuffed with packing peanuts. I could immediately tell that it would not be good for me for a comfortable nights sleep."
66992,0,"Shipping took about 2 weeks and I paid for expedited shipping. That was disappointing but the shorts are nice. Simple and not too long like most athletic shorts these days. I'm 5'10"" and they extend to just above my knees."
256814,0,"let me say the gun feels great, looks awesome, and has great iron sights.then let me say, the gun broke in 5 shots. maybe its just airsplat and no quality control, but it broke. on the barrel of the gun there are two little buttons that hold the two main parts together, and it broke. when i shot, the whole gun came apart. after a little tampering and figuring out what to do, i taped it back together with electrical tape. it works now. pretty good power, good at least for a sidearm, but beware, when loading it the bbs have to go in zig-zagged or else they will jam your gun, and not fire at full power.pros:pretty good powernice lookrealistic feeleasy to cockfantastic sights + very accurate (use .2g bbs, .12g CURVE!!)cool looking hammercons:mine brokesmall and finicky magazineFINICKY MAGAZINEoverall i think this is a good sidearm, shoots decent power, and is extremely accurate with .2g. but if the bbs in the magazine aren't loading zig-zagged, it sometimes doesn't shoot full fps. otherthan that and the fact that mine broke, its a good side arm, for my sniping needs. Again its pin point accurate!"
406463,1,"Well, if you're not a penguin this is the product you need to buy. It allows you to scuba dive anywhere as deep as you can go. Went to dive at the titanic and they are still working."
84457,0,"Takes a bit of time to take your heart rate. Difficult to get heart rate when moving so, if you're running, you won't always get a heart rate. Does not work if your fingers are wet...so, if you're sweaty, forget it. On the positive side, you don't have to wear a chest strap so if you're not going to use this for hardcore training where you MUST know what your HR is at very crucial times (like when your doing intervals), it's not half bad.As an aside, I wear this when I surf and swim. It says it's waterproof up to 10M. I've had it for 3 months and now, the buttons don't work. I'm sending it to MIO for warranty repair. So, that's another $12 spent on a $30 watch."
485069,1,I got this at my LBS and it was easy to put on.It is soft to the touch.Much nicer than what can on my touring bike.And the color looks nice too.Any one looking for good handlebar tape here it is.
265409,0,"Pros.It came very sharp,handle has rubbery textured grip,decent blade,sheath is kydex or like.Cons.Blade wiggles a bit,tip could fail during hard use (this is not the high carbon model),sheath will not securely hold the knife at all,unless you use the snap closesure also its molded to the knife so only one way in.No pommel for hammering.I bought this as an cheap alternative to a Fallkniven knife,as just a general camp knife,I hardly use anymore because of the sheath (its Dangerous without the snap). You get what you pay for."
471961,0,A weld that allowed the use of the angled transition piece failed so now it is two short rails of different heights and doesn't get much use. The feet stick out to the side which hampers the approach to the bar especially when its short.
233620,0,"I bought a similar item for my friend. He liked it a lot. the only problem was that it a shade too small for him. but he is still using it al the same. For the price I got it for, I expected a good size but I cant complain. it is fair to buy."
498062,1,There is a reason for all the positive reviews on this product. It's worth trying. Consistently comfortable - I use them when travelling when I know I'll be seated for a long time.
361166,2,I got this scooter e-100 for christmas and have problems all the time.The back wheel wore down to the inner tube in the first 2 weeks.Now it makes alot of strange noisy.Now we can't get the scooter to charge up.My mom gets no response from razor and the replacement parts would add up to cost more they we paid for the scooter.It is not worth it trust me.I am 9 years old.
182810,0,"I bought this as a replacement for another Speedo model which looks exactly the same and sold for approximately the same price. This suit is simply two layers of nylon. Much lighter weight fabric. No modesty panel. (I am an older gent). Tie is now cord, not tape and is about two feet too long. In general, feel the quality of this suit is less than the model it replaces. When this one wears out, I'll probably look elsewhere for a replacement."
242403,1,Bought two of these shirts and love them. They wear well under short-sleeved shirts for layered comfort. The material is not too light and not too heavy.
125329,1,"I've used lots of paddles that look just like these (1/4"" plywood core, double layer rubber surfacing) and I've usually found them heavy and cumbersome. Not these. They are well balanced and nimble and offer fantastic spin on the ball. I'm no ping pong pro, but I do like to play with spin and these rackets are great."
4645,0,"All in all this product is just ok. The chips are good but the case, cards, etc are pretty cheap. Price was ok. On the fence on this product."
138535,1,"It works best with two people -- unlike the picture showing one person see-sawing the rope chain. I purchased in lieu of hiring tree-trimmers and found it to be effective. First time around,I wasn't successful doing it single-handedly. Second time around, with additional helper with a great pitching arm, we were amazingly successful. It took less than 5 minutes per 8"" diameter tree limb. Dead tree limbs took seconds to fall. If you want an affordable solution to tree cutting without the use of power tools or ladders, I highly recommend. Any adult can do."
376238,0,"OK, let me first start by saying on the surface (and in practice) this is a nice rack...Now to the ""beware"" portion...I bought this new, on sale, at Amazon...product arrived and had obviously been opened/put together before. The zip-ties were cut and laying loose in the box, Some of the components were already partially assembled, The baskets/trays were bent, poles had paint scratched off, and one piece was wedged inside a pole forcing me to use vice-grips to get it out (likely why the previous person returned it)...So, aside from those annoyances, I wanted the rack and didn't want to wait for a replacement/deal w/ the hassle of boxing it up again/etc. (and the things gonna get scratched/bent anyway)...so assembly was fairly straight-forward...As long as you follow the one part of the instructions that state to not tighten anything until you've gotten it fully assembled...I surmise this is because the person/team who designed this likely slept through the part of mechanical design class where they teach the concept and importance of stack up tolerances...nothing lines up w/o some finessing (minimal at first, much more towards the end)...and the hole for the top cross bar was off by a good 1/2""...which leaves a nice rotational aspect to the overall stand when you finally get to tighten everything up...Additionally, the unit I received differed from the unit pictured (hooks were different in style and the manner in which they are attached/installed, and resulted in my having to take a portion of the rack apart to put them on (not the ones for the bikes, but the other, smaller ones for hanging other items), as they must go on as you build it up, not after the fact (I'll take the blame on that one, as I should have known better))...also, specs on the site state dimensions are 19"" x 27"" x 82""....In reality, it is actually 22"" x 29 1/2"" x 88 1/2"", making it too tall for the place I had originally planned for it to go (the width and depth dimensions are taken at the base, where the legs flare out...if you take them further up, they may be the same as listed in the specs)...Another nit is that the bikes go onto the narrow side of the rack...unfortunately, w/ today's full suspension bikes and other creative geometries, the uprights where the hooks are located are spaced too wide to fit some bike frames and you're left w/ finding creative approaches for the hooks (even rotating them inwards doesn't do the job on some bikes)...two bikes have the hook under the front of the saddle as opposed to the frame, which isn't the best place for long term storage...a better design would have been to make the stand slightly narrower allowing for better frame placement, but understandably it might make the overall unit ""tippy"" when adding/removing bikes...In ""concept"" I give the rack a 5...in ""reality"" I give it a 1 (due to the condition upon arrival, differences between what is pictured, poor design tolerances, and grossly inaccurate dimensions)...averaging out to my 3 star rating, as it will still prove to be a somewhat convenient method of getting the bikes out of the way...There are likely better options out there, but this seemed the most compact w/ greatest capacity for my 4 bikes and my wifes 2..."
325661,1,"I LOVE this seat. I installed it quickly on my schwinn step-thru Women's bike. My son is near the top of the weight limit for this seat, but he's too young to ride yet on the tow bike. With him sitting in the seat, the bike rides incredibly balanced, surprisingly so. I had a rear mount seat that I used previously, but that seat threw my balance off when he fell asleep and his head knocked from side to side. Luckily we weren't going fast and did not crash. Like I said, the weight is supported and distributed well. Oh, and, he loves biking with me. We installed a bell to chase the birds from the sidewalk. I wish this came in with a higher weight limit!"
474698,0,"Good Deal. Buttons are a little weird. You get 5 buttons, which is certainly way more than one would need, but they are assigned poorly.The instructions are poor when it gets to the advanced features. BasicSetup of the watch, alarm, modes and use of the stop-watch or timer are fairly well explained. Use of the Heart-Rate Monitor is poorly explained through all three books ... everybody expects you to go somewhere else.Most troublesome is that there is a manual-setting for the hear-rate range but no instruction at all on how to set it to an upper and lower limit range which has been prescribed by a qualified coach or physician. It is not too hard to figure out how to select one of the built-in ranges.I have not been able to figure out how to set it, myself.So I just look at the thing every minute or so and check to see if I'm where I ought to be ... probably better to pay attention to it myself anyway."
370023,2,"The good--you can see fairly well in the dark at very close range.The bad--specs say 5x magnification...and it doesn't do anything like that. In fact, no zoom capability whatsoever. When I called Night Owl's support to ask about that, the support person had no idea what I was talking about. I phoned the next day and the next--the same person answered the phone every time and she knew NOTHING about the product! I wrote an email to Night Owl--no response. So this product DID NOT deliver (at least to me) what it promised in the specs and there is NO SUPPORT for it. Have returned and have no intention of going Night Owl again."
150824,0,"The watch works well and keeps reasonably accurate time (10 sec/month). For the price it's very good, but I wish it had a sweep second hand."
269748,0,"I'm glad I bought this (at $159), but it has a few drawbacks that I didn't expect. First, everyone said the ride was smooth, but I find it a little awkward and sticky, even at the lowest tension. It's as if it needs WB40 (but there's nowhere to apply it). Maybe that's a feature of all magnetic bikes? Also, the computer is so simple as to be almost useless. It turns on when you start pedaling and flashes time, distance, speed, and calories (it's unclear how they're calculating calories--there are no real instructions about the computer). There is no memory and it starts over, erasing your old data, if you've taken a long break. Also, the bike is rather small. I am 5'3 and it fits me well, but there is no way my 6'3 husband could use it comfortably -- the seat only goes up a few more inches from where I've set it for myself. And yes, the seat is not very comfortable. On the plus side, I found it very easy to assemble, even in connecting the tension cable everyone mentions. Tightening bolts on the seat and pedals required a wrench, but otherwise it was quick and easy. The bike seems sturdy and of decent quality overall."
336605,2,"Don't buy this. It doesn't work. The ink is not even at all if and when you can get it on the stamp. I've attempted around 50 stamps (on some range balls) and not one is crisp and clear. The stamp is either running (too much ink), or the middle letter is messed up from too little ink.Save your money, buy a sharpie pen and mark your balls with that."
469586,2,"I've had this knife for about 2 years and I used it moderately to divide perennials. It has worked fine for that purpose until I used it for the first time this spring and the handle slipped off. The big-grip handle is glued to the metal shaft and the glue seems to have deteriorated with age. If you are interested in a garden knife, I would recommend something with a forged handle since these tools see some tough duty, glues and plastic aren't going to last."
201080,1,The bike was relatively easy to put together and is quiet and efficient. It seems to be durable enough for me and versatile enough for my wife.
376502,0,"Great construction, seems to work well but it didn't come with any hardware to attach to my Delta truck rack. Bummer!"
441876,0,"I like prAna. The material is stretchy and the shirt hasn't lost it's shape after many uses/washes. I never have to adjust it, no matter how hard the practice is. My only complaint is that it feels a little hot, and when it gets sweaty, it doesn't really wick the sweat away from your skin. All in all, I don't think that's much of a problem, and would purchase prAna again."
422411,1,"If you're done with cheap umbrellas that turn inside-out at the slightest breeze, this is the umbrella for you! The way it's constructed, with 2 layers, allows for wind to blow through it, without you getting wet...brilliant! I later bought one for a friend as a gift."
164394,2,"I was disappointed that the product I received had changed and did not match the photo. Specifically, it did not have the orienting lines on the baseplate. Depending on how you plan to use the compass, this may not be an issue, but it definitely is less useful for orienteering."
21082,1,"I'd recommend Bianchi belts to anyone, whether ""professional"" or not. They last. I only bought this because I added inches. The old belt, almost 25 years old, is still fine. Unless something changes at Bianchi, I'd continue to use these belts forever. Worth every penny."
441043,0,"I use this line mainly for drifting for catfish. This line is quite stiff compared to other line that is the same weight. However, I have not had any problem with breakage, but tying knots can be a problem."
388763,0,"The knife is good. The handle has a hand-friendly shape and a non-slip texture. It was very sharp out of the box. Most fixed-blade knives are either too large to be convenient or too small to be usefull over long periods. This one is just right.The price is a little high, given that it is a fixed-blade knife and has no moving parts. The steel used is fairly standard stuff and the handle is an easily molded material. Nothing about it should make it expensive, although Amazon's price is considerably lower than most online competitors. You can probably find a roughly equally functional knife for less but not quite as durable long-term and not as stylish. As with other SOG knives, you have the choice of:(1) paying a little more for the name and style, but still getting a decent knife with a little more flare than alternatives at Wally-World(2) getting a cheaper knife that is CLOSE to the same quality and saving about $10-15(3) paying almost double the price to move up to the next quality levelLike many other knives of its type, this one comes with a sheath that looks like more of an afterthought that was grudgingly put together by the manufacturer at the end. It works, but the overall finish and quality is not up to the quality level of the knife. It is made of a semi-flexible plastic material used with many quality knives these days. But this one has sharp, scratchy edges and is larger than necessary in total size. SOG also appears to have panicked while making the sheath because they didn't know exactly what direction to go in. The sheath can be used almost any way imaginable, but is not ideal for any use. But if you want a regular old standard knife sheath, there are TONS of aftermarket options out there for literally just a few dollars."
275050,0,I ordered 2 shirts: 1 Oxford and 1 Green. I received the Oxford but never received the green one and now it does not even show I ordered it. I would give the shirt 5 stars but the order problem is not right.

188439,1,These bags worked exactly the way we hoped they would.I bought them to use for tailgating at the stadium and they were excellent!I found A way to fight back the New England weather.I highly recommend.Thanks!
368203,0,"Up front, a large disclaimer - I do not own this product, and gave it 3 stars as a 'guessed at' rating.So why am I writing a review? Well, I thought I'd pass along a very helpful bit of information I received while I debated between this bike light set and a similar, more expensive one from Planet Bike also offered by Amazon. This light set includes the Beamer 1 headlight, while the more expensive one features the 1/2 watt Blaze headlight (also from Planet Bike). In reading the reviews I saw where people had said the Beamer 1 was a bit dim, but that didn't clarify things for me.What I'd recommend is to go over to the Planet Bike web site and fire up their 'See the Light' feature, [...]. This very helpful web page shows you *exactly* how each of the different products work, and the area they illuminate."
408049,0,"Got lax and didn't realize it was for one barbell, made assumption I was getting two based off price. Even with Prime's free shipping and a 20% discount one barbell costs more than picking it up locally.Never had a problem with any Cap equipment and will continue to purchase them."
211255,0,"A year or so ago I bought a $10 messenger bag-styled purse at Target just hours before I had to leave for a vacation. It has been worn down since then, and I was looking for a similar, if slightly smaller, replacement. The Urban Explorer bag is almost identical, except made of a more sturdy fabric and... entirely lacking zippers. I'm a clumsy, pell-mell kind of lady, so I like something with zippers just in case I climb a tree or something.This bag is fine, but it's basically just a bunch of open holes. The velcro doesn't promise secure holding, so it isn't useful to me. I'll be returning this product, but it's more my fault than anything else. Also, I prefer something more lightweight and this fabric is extremely heavy, which is nice for durability, but not something i want to be burdened with when it's stuffed and I'm walking.Also: a lot of people made this bag seem smaller than it is. You might not be able to fit a full-sized notebook in it, but it's a near miss."

10139,0,"I've been using ellipticals in the gym for the last 2 years and recently decided to purchase one for the home. The approx. $600 price of this unit compared favorably to the NordicTrak, ProForm, and Fitness Quest models I had looked at. After approx. 14 workouts on this machine, here is my assessment:Pros:-Smooth action elliptical for forward-stride exercise-Seems to be solid frame and construction, quite stable compared to others-Nice stride length compared to similarly-priced machines-Resistance levels are limited but you can still get a killer workoutCons:-LCD display is very difficult to read (no backlight, small letters)-NO PLACE FOR YOUR WATER BOTTLE-Design of this stacked, front-located flywheel machine makes reverse-stride (backpedaling) exercising anatomically very stressful and not sustainable, in my own experience. The rear-flywheel machines are best if you desire this option (really hits the glutes good).-Heart rate monitor is absolute crap. My average Polar heart rate strap indicates 140+ while on this machine, but the handle-grips on EX55 never get higher than 95, no matter what kind of contortions I go through to modify my grip or palm surface condition (dampness, dryness, position, grip force, etc...)-Squeaks developed after 5 workouts (also observed by previous reviewer); apparently related to handlebar assembly, but still irksome-Assembly instructions could be much clearer!Summary: This affordable machine can give you a great workout, but don't count on accurate heart rate data or anything more than the most basic workout programs and levels."

368112,0,"I've only worn these goggles for 2 months and swim at most two times per week. Slowly over the past two weeks the goggles have started to leak on the right side...the suction just does not ""keep"". Amazon's return policy for ""most"" products over 30 days is 50%...what a rip-off. If you must buy these, buy them from some place that you can return/exchange a ""defective"" item after 30 days without that much of a hit in your wallet."

488320,0,"Interesting product - I do feel it is overrated as a fitness product. It seems to be too triceps intense - in other words, my triceps get tired before I can really do all the exercises. It is different, which I like, but I get bored with it very quickly. It might be better as a rehab tool, but I really can't speak to that."
432048,1,Just installed and rode on these for the first time. They are excellent. Had been using SPD mountain bike pedals on my road bike for years. These are so much more stable and efficient. Also like the fact that the correct cleats are included with these.
388533,0,"Now, I have the safe for 9 months. I thought I will add more information about my experience.The mechanical combination lock is a good idea. You do not have to worry about batteries dying or electrical failures. However, after you turn the first number of the combination lock, then it automatically lands on the rest of the combinations as you turn the combination knob. That's why I changed my review from 5 stars to 3 stars. The idea behind buying a safe is privacy and protection. If the combination lock is easy to open then there is no point of using it as a safe.The outside and inside of the safe looks like it is made out of plastic. However, the safe has good amount of weight. Therefore, it makes me wonder if there is metal under the plastic. Plastic might be used on the exterior surface to increase the longetivity of the safe (to protect it from rusting). I am just making an assumption. We need an expert from First Alert to tell us why this safe looks like it is made out of plastic.P.S. - I am able to pick up the safe by myself (6'2"" and 180lbs).--------I have this safe little over a month now. It is great for what I need. There is enough space to put important documents and other valuables.Despite the other comments, my item was well packaged. It came with packaging material on all four corners to protect the item during shipment. I have posted a picture of it.I also purchased an Eva-dry Renewable Mini Dehumidifier. The case was closed for a full month and the humidifier did not show any sign of moisture. All the paper documents were dry and did not indicate any sign of moisture either.It is a great value for the price. Make sure to read the Operation & Installation Guide for proper use and maintenance."

150023,0,"My shipment arrived on time and was packaged well. The cost of the product was just average; it certainly is no bargain, but apparently it is difficult if not impossible to find beachbody prices below their suggested retail price. P90X plus expands on the original... sort of. I am in week 3 of the program now and it's kicking my @$$ as expected. But while p90x will test your endurance, stamina, and strength, X plus is geared more towards endurance. I can't see how this is going to build muscle, but it probably will reveal muscle! I am definitely more out of breath doing plus; expect a cardio paced workout! To critique Tony Horton, well, I just have to wonder why he moves through the stretch/warm up phases so quickly compared to the original. All in all, I am glad I have something to change up my p90x workouts. I have done two back to back phases of X and it does get awfully repetitive, so the 70 dollar price tag was worthwhile to me for a change of pace."

453660,0,"Received it & used it the same day while comparing to my old regular ab roller. Looks more hardcore. Although no paper instruction provided, there were some assembly required. Just have to mirror the other side of axel to complete the installation. With its size, it should've come with its own carrying case. It so big it & odd shape, it doesn't fit in my gym bag. This is the reason why it's 1-star less.Much harder to use since it has a larger diameter than a regular ab wheel which I don't have a problem using. Harder to balance & to make sure to pull my leg evenly. Need to get to use to it. I have to make sure that both my feet are aligned while strapped on to the unit or else there's a pull to one side. The wheel even though has a wider base & has the diamond traction looks, it's not rubberized enough to grip the tile floors of a fitness room (no rubber mat area). Even with a bigger wheel which is bad enough to balance on, my feet still some way some how drags to the floor. Again, the other reason why it's 1-star less.Don't know how bad of an idea it is, but I haven't tried using it in conjunction with a regular ab roller while this one is attached to my feet. I'll have to wait for the time until I have full abdominal muscle control to do this. That's down the road... Further down the road. =)"

198440,1,"I have Tracy's 30 day transformation video, which I love! Squeeze Stronger didn't disappoint me. I love it! Tracy gives excellent tips on form and the DVD is completly easy to customize. I love barre exercises and this had some new moves and combos... The pretzel clam series hurt so good. I have the clam exercise on other dvd's but I didn't feel it as much as I did on this one. Tracy is very clear on positioning. The pace was little pepppier than some barre videos, but not so fast that you don't get it or even worse hurt your back. For me the length of the dvd is too advanced, but you can customize it or pick and choose what you want or have time to do. It has different exercises than my other Squeeze which is great for rotations. I really like Tracy's personality and teaching style. I hope she makes more videos, in my opinion she is one of the best. I felt as if I were with an excellent personal trainer. (Which a lot of us can't afford.)"
309540,2,"Cannot review the item as I had the same problem as the other reviewer. Gave it 1 star because they're still shipping the wrong item after several months. I, too, got a regular titanium spork, not one with a clip and bottle opener. Returned it to Amazon. Never had this problem with Amazon before, even using their affiliated sellers. Shipping costs were refunded since this was their error and there was no shipping cost for me to return it. Disappointed to get wrong item, but return service was easy."

301200,0,"It has been a long time since I have owned a dive watch, and this is the first automatic watch I have had. I really like the way the watch looks, and the visibility of the face is great. I work at a desk for long days, but I have not had problems with the watch running down at night. It has only run down one time when I did not wear it for an extended period. It is a little thick, but probably no more so than a lot of dive watches. I really just have 2 complaints:1) For some reason, I can't get the band to fit comfortably. I am between hole sizes, and I guess the band is not flexible enough to make one of these work.2) It seems to be a little fast. Probably only a minute or so a week, but I expected a lot better than that. As I type this, it is 5 minutes ahead, which is a little too much to be useful."

76844,0,"For those with the socks I want you to understand that they are cool looking socks, but for some reason there is thread all bunched up together almost like a ball of thread embedded into some of the socks that came into the package. I say ""embedded"" because you can't cut the thread with scissors without completely ripping the sock apart. (Had to throw the ones with this problem away, way too uncomfortable)The socks I bought only had some with this problem and I know Under Armour didn't intend for this to happen considering it is uncomfortable to walk with the socks and feel that bump of thread every step you take. Hopefully they'll notice this problem and fix it."
405283,0,"works pretty good. On my one bike I have a child's seat & I had to put add support to the rack. I also bought one for my wife's bike.I was looking for space & mobility, so I now have one for the front and back tire. Without the front, you can roll it easily enough, but the front tire still turns. I don't have room in my garage for a wall mount, otherwise that would be my preference."
328962,1,"We gave this as a gift for Christmas, and we had a chance to check it out before wrapping. The helmet's as expected, literally looks and feels like an NFL helmet, but on a mini scale. It will certainly look good on an office desk, or a shelf, although it would be great if one could turn it upside down and use it as a coffee mug!Nice product for the NFL fan, I think we'll keep this in mind as a gift idea for others next year."

456081,1,"This is a great blanket! The back is a water-resistant material so you don't get wet when sitting on damp grass. The top is a soft cotton type material. The blanket is lightly padded to keep you comfortable from hard ground and small pebbles. It's machine washable. It folds up easily to fit back in the matching tote bag that it comes packed in. It's large enough to hold two adults, a baby and all of the baby's play things. I'm so glad I purchased this and I look forward to many years of use."

404281,0,"Ordered this thinking it was a set, because the picture of each size shows a set, yet it was not. Can't return it because the papers that came in the box were shredded and messy, return label was already removed from the sheet, not that I could be bothered to return it. The box it came in was smashed in. The dumbbell itself is good, and will serve its purpose. Will have to order another dumbbell because it was not a set, but will NOT order it from Amazon.com"
89966,0,"Ok, to start off my bestfriend's friend came over to day with his new ""Super 9 Pro"". I was so exited to see it, but then when he brought it over, it was all made of plastic, and it didn't even shoot close to 400FPS! I almost died!So now I have decided to go with a Tokyo Marui VSR-10, because of all the complements on there quality of there brand, but I did some research and then I figured it would shoot as fast as a ""Super 9 Pro"". [which was labeled on the details of the product] Well with no upgrades. I am a guy that doesn't won't to put upgrades ""INTO"" to the gun because I am definietly not a handyman, also because of all the bad things I have heard about taking apart the gun.So I need help deciding on what gun I should purchase, and what website I should purchase it from. My price range is from $250-$275. I want a gun that shoots 370FPS+. Also I want the gun to look pretty realistic. So I hope you can respond to my review, and hope you list some details about the gun that you think I should know about befor purchasing the gun that you have recomended for me.Thanks!"
299851,2,"I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly, looks really nice on me, and goes with everything. This is not it. This (Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114) is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket (style number 207 WL6114).I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I'm returning at least the two white ones, where the difference in quality is really noticable. I'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut, styling, workmanship, and quality control is not as noticable. In white, mine look cheap and slightly flawed, workmanship wise. I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a (cheap) white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier, softer and thicker and the white is pinker. That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it's predessor.It's so hard to replace women's clothes when they wear out, even in classic styles. Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it's ""out of style"" in the brand I start with. Are they assuming it never wears out? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket, not before I got a lot of wear out of it, and a white jacket cannot stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant."
239932,0,I had to constantly squeegee this thing after ball breaks. paint in the barrel messes up the backspin effect. I was using an rt and cyclone feed and fount that I broke a lot of paint frequently and that frustrated me. So yeah it's just okay when I had a clean barrel and my shot didn't explode in the gun...

196587,0,"My first introduction to Gold Toe socks was around 1998. Absolutely fell in love with these socks. Thick yet still amazingly elastic cotton. So comfortable that I refused to wear anything else. In fact, it's just now (14 years later) that the heels of all those original socks have worn away to nothing. So I purchased some more Gold Toe to replace them. Bah! Can't believe these things have the Gold Toe label. They wear and feel like your basic Hanes or FoTL. No density. No exceptional construction. Just your generic, thin sock. I'm so tired of things being made so cheaply. I don't mind paying more for quality, but it's like none exists anymore. Even the more expensive items are cheaply made...with your extra money going towards the brand alone. For me, Gold Toe socks are no longer a quality item worth investing in."
59026,1,"This is a heavier fleece - I ordered the lemon meringue, and the color is lovely, a little darker than the picture. It is a bit heavier than I thought it would be, but it is very warm, and looks like it will last a long time."

Just no way to get around fogging unless...you stop exhaling?"
402178,0,"Been using the hydration pack for about 4 months now. I bought 2 of these (1 for me and 1 for my son). The pack holds enough water for the length trails that we ride. The packs are easy to fill and clean. They are comfortable and have a zippered pocket that hold my phone. For the price it is almost a great buy. Unfortunately, this is where the positives end. The mouth valve leaks and leaks constantly. I end rides with my left leg soaked to the point where water can be squeezed out of the shorts. I cannot get the valve to stop leaking. It's made for an extremely frustrating product experience. I don't know if Camelbaks are any better, but I will buy one just to avoid the leaky valve."

143674,0,"I agree with a couple of the previous reviews. I swim five days a week and these lasted about 6 months before they got stretched out. The backside is showing some wear too (right in the crack). They are really tight around the knees and they come down about an inch too low for my taste as they tend to ride right into the back of the knee at the fold. I would have preferred they stay up an inch or two on the thigh.They do look cool, and they were pretty good for a few months, but I'm looking for something better."

388150,0,"I bought these at REI and they really do keep you from falling down. I used them quite a bit today and there is a downside. As I was stepping out of some snow and back onto the (icy) sidewalk I slipped and fell. I couldn't believe that that had happened since these had given me such good traction when I put them on. When I looked down I saw that one of them had come off and that I had slipped as a result of expecting more traction than I had. I put it back on and made sure that it was nice and secure, yet the same thing happened at least 3 more times. The strange thing is that every time it was the same one that came off, the other one stayed put all day."
473921,1,"Great little Thermos. I bought this so that I could toss it in a backpack and not worry about it getting all over my books or laptop throughout the day, which it accomplishes very well. Getting the seal right is a little tricky the first few times, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easy. It keeps your favorite beverage hot for several hours. It is also very sturdy. I dropped it on a hard surface from about 4 feet off the ground (twice in a row) and there was nothing to show for it. This was seconds after I had just filled and sealed it, and not a drop leaked from the little guy. Still works great weeks later.Be aware: The capacity isn't so great, as there's a little fill line about two inches below the rim that you can't go above if you want to ensure a proper seal. Also, since there are multiple lids, make sure you get everything when it arrives! I ordered from Amazon and the sipping lid was missing. They sent me a new one within a week.If you don't mind limited capacity and want a sturdy, effective, and leak-proof (if used as directed) thermos, then this is the one for you!"

It only chipped very slightly when I accidentally rammed it into the asphalt once (which I would expect), but still can withstand getting pounded against trees no problem.If this thing really does break after one hit, then it's clearly poor craftsmanship."
243109,1,"WARNING!!!!!!!! THIS WILL BECOME YOUR NEW FAVORITE!! no other long sleeve t-shirt can compare with these SUPREME Russel brand shirts. it is so universal you can wear it for anything for any task and looks and feels great too and it has great quality which can last for years to come. its so comfortable and loose you don't have to worry about the texture or fit because the description and pic on amazon is accurate. buy this product in your size, your actual shirt size because these shirts are a little looser. please guys do not pull hard or stretch these because first when you wash it for the first time it will shrink about 1/10 of its actual size, however even though the fabric is a cotton/polyester blend so it has some elasticity to it the material can be permanently stretched if forced enough though-but it maintains it shape great but you have the option of stretching it to fit your preference if you got long arms or something, normally most people are OK with this. THE KEY POINT OF THESE SHIRTS ARE THE DIRIBILITY AND QUALITY."

399854,1,"I bought this a little over a year ago and have absolutely loved it. Having played football through college and then coached for several years, I have been around weight lifting equipment for years. This is a quality built machine. It is not like the cheap ones you will find in most sporting goods stores! The list of exercises you can perform are too numerous to list. The bench and rack are very adjustable and have stops to help keep you from hurting yourself if you don't have a spotter.The negatives are that it comes in 7-8 boxes and takes half a day to put together. I put it together by myself, but it would have been much easier if I had someone help me. The other is price! It is a little pricey, but I believe it is well worth it. You can find it cheaper on Ebay. I bought it from a retailer on there for around $1800 including shipping!"

50593,0,"I purchased the Schwinn tricycle for my children because of the very good reviews, solid construction, rubber tires (I was tired of the noisy plastic tire sound), and classic looks. Other than the tires, which have a tendency to deflate rather quickly (based on my observation, you would need to re-inflate the tires once a week or so), the tricycle is very sturdy. The difficulty comes with the pedaling motion. Both of my children have had difficulty with the tricycle because the mechanism is too tough for them to move. I am not sure if it is the low base, heaviness, or combination of the two that make it difficult to use. The wheels seem to turn fine when upside down. It worked ok for my kids when going downhill, but then I had to pull them back up the hill and that got old fast. My children did not have any problems with our Fisher-Price plastic tricycle. I should not that my children are small for their age. Still, I would have expected them to get some utility out of the tricycle. This tricycle may work well for some, but did not for us. I would say it is not nearly as universal in design as some other tricycles. I did not feel the need to trash the product with a one or two star rating, but it definitely has some deficiencies in design that may limit a child's ability to use the product."
495707,0,The shirts are nice but the sizes are extremely roomy. I bought a couple of these for my dad who is pretty stocky and always wears and x-large but these were very big on him.
292399,2,"I purchased two of these bottles in May of 2008 with the stainless steel caps. We were very pleased with them and in August I purchased another. Although the third bottle was more than 20% less than when I made the first order, the quality of the bottle has degraded by at least 50%.It was immediately obvious upon opening the package that this was a much cheaper steel. It is thin, light-colored and rough. The inside of the older version is polished and smooth while this one is dull and hard to clean. My husband convinced me it was still good or else I would have returned it on the spot.We've had it now for 4 months, compared with the 7 months of the first two. All get the same general treatment and this last one is MUCH worse off. The plastic on the top of the cap is cut up and gouged and cuts into your hand every time you have to open it. More importantly, the steel is dented all over and is beginning to rust. There are dents along the bottom edge as well which make the bottle wobbly and unstable. This has not been through any use to cause such damage. The older bottles, with the thicker, higher quality steel, are holding up nicely and look as new as the day we bought them.I feel duped by a company that drew me in with a nice quality product and then lowered their standards. I will never buy anything from Klean Kanteen again. The $5 decrease in cost does not make up for the fact that I am throwing this bottle away 4 months after purchasing it."

230484,0,"These are kind of cheap. The chrome was coming off from the time I opened the box. I also didn't know it was rated for only 40 lbs. It would be nice if Amazon stated that, as it does say it right on the box. The grip isn't as padded as I would like, or not padded at all. They should have just made it a full chrome normal one."
152458,0,"I bought this hoping to use it with the Marin BayView 24"" girls bike but no luck. It is too long. Also there is no way to lock the bar at the preferred extension or a spring-loaded mechanism to keep it in place, even if it did fit (to be fair other similar products I've seen have similar design). I'm contemplating to mod with it with my favorite hacksaw if unable to find other solution. Other than than seem to be a solid product, thick molded plastic around the ears should prevent stem/post from scratching. 3 stars strictly on it not working for my purposes, YMMV - you may want to try it at your local retailer first before ordering online."
419866,0,"I needed more running/work out shorts, and I couldn't find anything to really beat this price. I love soffes, specifically because they ""move with your body"". They're normally not too baggy, falling down, or not fitting in those ""awkward"" areas.Either I've gotten to be a smaller size, or these shorts are knock-offs...because these shorts don't fit me like my other soffes. They're awkwardly baggy in the crotch, the bum isn't defined, the legnth is a bit longer than the others (even when ""properly"" rolled up).The main pro is that the material is very soft and comfortable. So I could see myself wearing these to the gym, and maybe even to bed on a warmer night.So bittersweet? I guess."
483937,0,"Bought the Vario prior to trip to Boundary Waters Canoe Area in northern Minnesota last week. Pumped worked great at home using tap water to flush and test pump. First day in BWCA, pumped approximately 3 quarts of water in center of lake with ""longer life"" setting and coffee filter around intake and noticed small leaks. Later in the day I pumped 2 gallons at lake center and pumping became more difficult and much lower output. Cleaned ceramic filter, cleaned main filter, but pumping very difficult with large leaks from head of pump and very slow flow rate. After about 6 gallons total output, main filter appears to need replacement.I asked at one of the major outfitting centers in Ely about their experience with Katadyn water filters and was told that they no longer sell them due to short filter life span and high filter replacement costs.Other than the short filter life, seems like a good product. I will most likely order another filter and use it out west where the water is much more clear."
162564,0,"I was looking for a basic heart monitor/stopwatch, having never had one before. Once I got the hang of the chest strap and transmitter, things generally go as expected - you get elapsed time, average heart rate and max heart rate. I didn't need more. The one real kicker is that the button below the display turns the record function on and off AND tells it to display the previous workout. Picture coming in from a hard workout, stopping the recorder, and then hitting the button to display the info but not holding it down quite long enough. It starts recording a new session, wiping out your old (just completed) workout. It has happened more than once. Maybe you are better coordinated than I am, but be careful."
414449,0,C'mon Yakima--$200 for this rack? Should be half that price for what you get. I'd give it 5 stars if the price was closer to $100. But only 3 because it's not. If price is no object you'll probably be satisfied on all levels. It's heavy duty and seemingly durable. No louder than Yakima racks are without a wind deflector (which is moderately loud). Holds fat skis with a two tier hinge system that expands for tall loads. Has a cool height extension feature for low mount OEM racks. It would really look cool in brushed aluminum like Thule but instead it's a fairly ugly grey. Looks like glossy primer--another strike against it.They're a pain to attach to your rack but that's the inherit security of the mounts. The biggest bonus is probably that they can mount to virtually any rack and include 2 sizes of high quality bolts for this purpose. The worst feature is the lack of locks. I bought locks because I'd hate to have someone thieve this expensive investment.

I needed an umbrella that would handle these sudden downpours, and this product, the GustBuster Metro, meets that need.At only 43 inches (109 cm) across this umbrella is fairly small. If I had tested umbrellas in a store first I would likely have bought a larger one. This one is good for just a single person, and seems just barely adequate for that.I like the color, a deep green (the manufacturer calls it Hunter). Black or navy blue would have been O.K., too.This umbrella has velcro straps integrated into it, so you can wrap it tightly when it is collapsed. In addition, it includes a nice nylon slip sleeve with an adjustable shoulder cord so you can put it away when you're done, or carry it conveniently until the rain starts.From my limited experience using this product (just one rain storm so far...) it seems to be a great product. I'm glad I paid a little extra for a solid product."
248812,1,"This cart looks fantastic. The aluminum really shows off. Very high quality material. The wheels are really nice; large and smooth.Arrived in original box. Assembly was very straightfoward: take it out, snap the two wheels on, and done. 10 seconds to figure all that out. There is not much of a ""manual"" so the user is pretty much on his own.The height of the handle is adjustable within a pretty narrow range, but the lowest setting is just right for me. It has a scorecard holder which snaps to two layers of paper (so you have to fold the scorecard, otherwise it's loose). The pencil holder works. It has two ballholding slots, and they don't seem to be the same size (i.e. the same ball is loose in one, doesn't fit in the other); not sure if it's by design. I had a TopFlite XL that wouldn't fit in either slot, but Titleist and Callaways do. The 4 tee holders and the waterbottle + holder is convenient.For some reason, the top strap is a bit too high for my bag so it's a bit undesirable.It does the job. Very easy to roll up and down the hill. Tipped over once for me on a steep hill. Very easy to clean. Detach the wheels and hose them and you're pretty much done. Great price here on Amazon too."

163224,2,"The tent is generally OK, but the poles are awful. One ferrule started to bend after the first use and I had to hammer it back into place. The second trip was OK but on the third trip, yet another ferrule disconnected and had to be re-crimped to work it. So with only three camping trips, I had trouble on two of them. Tried to get the poles replaced only to find out that the warranty only covers 'manufacturing defects.' You get to pay for shipping to send your poles to them and they'll tell you whether it's a real problem or not. Just getting a replacement pole was going to cost me almost fifty percent of the original price. Save your money with this company."

384605,0,"You can get a good twisting motion with this board for your waist. It is a fun and easy to travel with workout. However, the board itself is a bit small for a larger person. Unless you have cat-like balance and yoga poses, it is hard to put both feet on this board.I suppose it makes for a better exercise. Flexing and working all your muscles to support yourself. Someone needs to make a board with a larger base."
286713,0,"I purchased this thermos a few years ago because I loved the idea of having a Thermos that can not only be used in the office but also on camping and river trips because it floats. It keeps liquid quite hot, especially if you temper (pre-heat it with hot water), but the problem is that the thermos bottle is simply screwed-into the plastic outer case and there's a little glue at the bottom that holds it all together. If you use it alot (like I do ) the glue will break down, and everytime you try to unscrew the stopper from the top, the whole metal bottle will unscrew from the plastic housing from the force of unscrewing the stopper instead of the stopper coming unscrewed. I've tried to glue it back with a variety of glues (including Gorilla Glue, but it only lasts for a short time). Also, when you fill the Thermos, a little water can pass between the metal bottle and the clamp ring that holds the bottle in the plastic housing. This little water sitting in the plastic housing can just sit there and grow bacteria as well as react with the metal part of the thermos. Thermos could easily fix these issues. I am a little disappointed with the quality, and am not surprised since Thermos now makes everything in China instead of the USA. I am let down by Thermos and have decided to buy Stanley Brand Thermoses because they stand behind their products with a lifetime guarantee and if something like this ever happens with a Stanley, I know they will replace it."

313799,0,"These are very comfortable gi pants. They are a good heavy weight, but soft cotton, not the heavy canvas type, flexible and easy to move in. I've had several different gi pants, and these are, by far my favorite. They are elastic waistband, rather than drawstring, but I prefer that. And as a female martial artist it can be difficult finding gi pants that fit well, but these are definitely the best I've worn.Update to this review: I had decided to purchase another pair of gi pants and ordered these again since I liked them so much the first time. Unfortunately, the gi pants that arrived this time were nothing like the first. The previous pants were brushed cotton, elastic waist. The pants I received the second time were the heavy canvas type material, drawstring waist, and had the ProForce label on the front, exactly what I did not want. I'm guessing the description is intentionally confusing because the pants come from different vendors and Tiger Claw has no idea what may really be shipping? At least I was able to return them without difficulty and was able to find another pair of gi pants elsewhere that fit perfectly. Just be aware when ordering the gi pants may be different than what you expect."

318129,0,did not end up being the sheets i had hoped for with the imprinted steeler logo. instead the imprint is NFL with a football. the only steelers design is on the pillow case which is bothersome to put your face against. also the material is a stretch cotton and you must be careful with it in the dryer for shrinkage and for the design.
6207,2,"First, let me say that I'm a fan of Reef sandals and own several pairs but these sandals disappointed at every turn. I know the flask is a novelty but less than 1 oz. per shoe... Really? Come on!The bigger problem arose after only several days of wear when the plastic (flask part) on both shoes cracked and crumbled, so even if I did want a drink fit for a lilliputian it would not have been possible.I know what you're thinking... And no, I'm not fat, this is just a terrible product that should have never made it to market."
75702,1,"I've been doing drywall and taping for over 4 years now and have been using this product the whole time. This is by far the best reusable dust respirator out there, especially compared to the paper disposable masks that do nothing but lets in dust or whatever else your working on. For some reason they have decided to stop producing this and have taken them out from all retail stores. I guess now since 3M bought them out or whatever the hell happened, they have completely yanked the rug out of a quality product and now giving us crap. Way to go guys, way to ruin a perfectly awesome product."
180150,1,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this set of pots and pans. I really like this set! From the little black ditty bag (great for hang-drying your dishes once they're washed) to the handles. I LOVE the compact size and the nesting. As far as cooking goes, it can't be beat! Made a pair of eggs in the ""skillet"" and cleaned up with a paper towel. Like with any Teflon coated surface, I'm sure that they will become a little harder to clean as camping trip go by. You can prevent this by not starting out with Brillo pads or steel wool right away. Try the paper towel and a little soap and water and see where that gets you!"
377593,0,i have had better darts in the past but between apartment moves and now moving into our own house they were lost. these darts are good but the shaft loosens too easily but it does come with a nice case and the dart tool. a decent set but there are better out there.
319500,2,"The mirror is TINY. I mean really, really tiny.Admittedly, I've never owned a mirror like this before, so maybe this is the norm for cheap ($10-$15) mirrors, but it's not something I felt comfortable using. I could barely see anything unless it was directly behind me. I thought the point of these mirrors was to get a good sweeping view behind you. This mirror definitely didn't provide anything close to ""sweeping.""I ended up returning it the same day that I got it. I ended up purchasing a different mirror:Safe Zone Bicycle Helmet MirrorIt's quite a bit more expensive, but I'm considering this life-saving equipment.When I get it I'll post a review and let you know if it lived up to my expectations."
297129,0,"It is suppose to fire .177 pellets and BB's but it's really only a BB Gun. Shooting the BB's that came with it, the gun had a very wide spray pattern. Using the pellets that came with it, the pistol would miss fire and even Jam. When it would fire pellets it had a fairly tight shot pattern. I bought some Destroyer pellets (By Crosman)and many of the pellets fit too loosly in the magazine and would cause the gun to jam. When firing ""Daisy"" BB's it had a much tighter shot pattern than with the crosman BB's. I also bought a Crosman laser sight and that was a joke. It wouldn't stay focused, and quit working before the 2nd Co2 cartrige was half empty. I then bought a NcStar Red Dot Laser sight and it works great. If you want a Pellet Gun then buy a Pellet Gun. If you want a BB Gun then this one will do if you are content with only a 8 Shot Magazine."

The backside is showing some wear too (right in the crack). They are really tight around the knees and they come down about an inch too low for my taste as they tend to ride right into the back of the knee at the fold. I would have preferred they stay up an inch or two on the thigh.They do look cool, and they were pretty good for a few months, but I'm looking for something better."

505090,0,This sword came within a reasonable amount of time and was really heavy. The weight of the sword was amazing I had no idea how heavy and solid this sword really was. The main problem I had with the sword is when it got here all the brass pieces except for the hilt were loose and came right off. I had to use a hot glue gun to fix them and re-attach all the brass pieces to the sheath. Another thing that impressed me was the quality and strength of the rope that holds the sword on your shoulder or belt. Great sword and a great buy for the price. Words of warning to those who lack some upper-body strength this sword is going to be difficult to get used to but if you would like a sword like this look for the sword of the other captain. Captain Gene.

349996,0,"It's quite thin, and 5 yards goes pretty fast so buy an extra roll. On both ends, some of the tape comes stuck to itself so that part was wasted. Also if you're wrapping something small and curvy (I was coating a PVC playstand for my parrot) the wide width means that you get a lot of wrinkles and wasted yardage. In just a couple weeks, it's already unsticking in places where I didn't have enough for a huge overlap. Overalll ok for what I wanted it for. As it's so thin I might not use it on horses though."

I received my bicycle quickly and with no damage, albeit a hole had been punched in the cardboard along the side. The only problem was with Fedex. They dumped the box in my yard and drove off. No notification, didn't even ring the doorbell!As for the bike, it needs some assembly, mainly the front wheel, both handlebars, seats and pedals. Instructions are included. Rear wheel and all gearing are fully assembled, and mine didn't need any adjustment other then loosening the chain between pedals a bit.All in all, this is a good first-time tandem. I have noticed a bit of fish tailing, and the fat tires would make trail riding rather sluggish.The seats are comfortable, and have a good range of adjustment.For $250, this is the best buy in tandem bicycles."

In addition, it considerably shrinks after the first wash. On the other hand, it is unexpectedly well made -- all the seams are straight."
292553,0,"This product is certainly a high-quality water bottle with the perfect amount of space for liquids. The 40 oz. size is great because it's not too large to stick in your messenger bag, but it's not so small that you have to refill it a lot throughout the day.I bought the orange one, and it looks really good, although the paint chips off within the first week or so. It says in the material that comes in the package that the bottles are dishwasher safe, but I would strong advise against that, as that's when the paint on mine started chipping away. However, there are other places since then where it has happened. If you don't mind a few areas of stainless steel shining through, then this is still an OK bottle for you.The standard cap for the bottle is great, and it seals tightly with no leaks, regardless of how you throw the bottle around. However, the bottle is VERY difficult to drink out of... the wide opening makes it tough to drink from without water spilling around the sides and down your face, onto your clothes, etc.The bottle does sweat a little bit, especially if the water in it is very cold or you put ice inside of it. However, it does not sweat nearly as much as similar plastic or steel bottles I've owned.Overall, there are some flaws to this bottle, but I'm not sorry I bought it because it serves its purpose well and it looks pretty cool at the same time! I do wish it held hot liquids too so that I could fill it with coffee sometimes."
343546,1,"Seal Line products have always been top on my list. Their quality construction and amazing materials make these bags durable and reliable. I have another Seal Line bag that is over 5 years old and even after extreme abuse, it still works great. I bought the Storm Sack, not as a replacement, but as a gift for a friend who is getting into sea kayaking to help him get started.The Storm Sack is extremely light and can pack down to near rocket-size when rolled up. It also has an excellent quality clip that snaps the ends of the bag together with a ring that you can run a line or carabiner through for attaching to your kayak, backpack or hanging from a tree, if you like. There is also a built-in carrying stap on the bottom to make handling easy and so you can dump you gear out when needed. Be sure to roll the open end down at least three times to create the best, water-tight seal.Whether you are an avid adventurer or just looking for a way to keep your clothes and gear free of water, sand and dust, look no further than Seal Line. You won't be let down."
345678,0,"Reviews on this item looked great, so I decided to try it. The outcome? I am disappointed, though the product is tolerable considering the price. The biggest problem is that the machine is not stable--when I bike on it, it moves around following my feet movement. So I have to put my hands on it to keep it in place and get some excercise. If I raise the resistance level, it becomes almost unusable because of the movement. (Maybe this is more so because I have hardwood flooring at home, and it might not move as much on a carpet. I could not try, since on my rather small carpet, the machine moved WITH the carpet. If you reduce the resistance level, it does not move around too bad--just up and down a bit with my feet.) In addition, the pedal is not that well made, feeling heavy and making small sound.Well, considering the price, I thought I could reduce the resistance level and tolerate the annoying movement and uncomfortable feeling of the pedals. But I found that I am not using it after a few tries, mostly due to the inconvenience. I simply cannot enjoy it. So I am returning it.I do not recommend this product. Especially if you want some real exercise, consider other options. But if you are ok with slow pedaling at a low resistance level, you might not have much complaint.I am not happy b/c the shipping cost will be quite high, given the product weight. The service representative wasn't very kind either, though again, tolerable."

484666,0,"I have only had this for a few weeks but have tried to put it to the test. The little flashlight is handy but not quite what I would consider bright, the magnet feature is really handy for holding a few loose screws. The screwdriver inserts seem to be of high quality. I have not tried the wrench yet, but the size range seems limiting (Mountain biking, great), more on that later. The knife blade seems to be fairly high quality.This is not a tool box. It is small, handy, light, convienent and has some great features. The wrench feature seems limiting, would have nice up to 5/8"". No pliers, but that is the point. Small. clip in on your belt, backpack, whatever you carry with you. At some point you will say to someone, ""Here, use this.""."
82179,0,these shorts run small and the elastic in the waistband is not very nice quality - kinda stiff and chunky. For athletis shorts to be worn exercising or working in the yard they are acceptable but they look cheap and I wouldn't wear them in public.

459150,1,"I love this watch.... I use it mostly for work and it can sure take a beating. The time zones features are great, and it has other useful features. Very light, and it isn't nearly as bulky as some of the other casio watches.The things I don't like: The cities listed are somewhat not what you would expect for some of the European countries (with the time zone feature). For someone who travels extensively, you have to be thinking. You also have no short cut for your home city like my other watch with world time zones. A lot of the cities I travel to aren't listed, so you have to look at the time difference or make sure the city listed is in the zone you want...The timer only counts down from an hour, in my job I need to keep track of flight times so we know how long until landing, so that is useless. On the other hand you can use the timer alarm and easy resets for working out..... My biggest dissapointment was with the strap replacements. I had to go to Germany to find an actual velcro strap to replace the rubber one that was scratching the inside of my wrist. I cannot believe that in this day and age when everyone can customize almost every item purchased online, I had such a hard time with that.All in all, I am very happy with the purchase, but it took a while of getting it exactly how I wanted it. Plus the fact that the analog and digital times are synchronized is really nice..... Good luck!"

But for my stringing machine practice, this string is cheap and good enough."""
484105,2,"I bought these thinking they would be great for my son's new airsoft guns. My son and I tried these in all three spring operated airsoft guns we have. NONE of the paintballs would break, infact they were so soft and rubber like that the paintballs often jamed when even loading one at a time. The airsoft guns we have range from 230fps to 265fps. I also have one that is 310fps, which is above the limit on the bottle (says not to use at more than 285fps). I fired them from all distances at a brick wall, even at point blank range these pieces of junk didn't break, they bounced. All I can say is if you want paintballs these are NOT the ones to buy. I wasted $60 on 6mm paintballs that don't break and I can't even use as ammo just to get rid of them because they don't load. Don't buy these...."
366857,0,"I bought several pairs because they were cheap and I just needed some shorts for the gym. I bought grey, black, navy, and green. The colors are pretty much accurate to the pictures.The material is thin, but I prefer something light-weight for working out. The elastic band doesn't bother me at all.I will say they are SHORT and SMALL. I generally wear a small and I ordered large for these (though a medium probably would have worked too). And they are very short - as in ""be careful when you're stretching"" short. I tend to wear them around the house all the time though since they're super comfortable."
57748,1,"I needed more chips for my weekly poker tournament. These work just fine.I was looking for clay chips as opposed to plastic so they would have the same weight as my current set. I didn't do much research, and assumed this would be the same. However, these 7-gram chips are every so slightly lighter than your standard casino clay chips (10 grams). On retrospect, I would have spent a few more bucks to get the heavier ones."
371753,1,"The consept is great. You can have one can and change from a shorter social bleat to a longer estrus bleat simply by allowing the bleat to continue for the estrus bleat or stopping it short for the social bleat. Tone is pefect but volume in my opinion should be a little bit louder. The Primos can bleat of the same size is much louder. Also, it does not have the hole in the bottom like the Primos cans, it does have a lid to cover it and it does muffle the sound but, it will still work in your pocket and the lid you will have to keep up with in the field. If the volume was a little louder and had a hole in the bottom to prevent the bleat from working in your pocket I would give 5 stars and claim this is the best can bleat on the market. I suppose a person could drill a hole in the bottom to eliminate it working in your pocket but, I just feel that should be taken care of at the factory."

It is not as sturdy as the Chuck Norris TBG, but you get your money's worth. It doesn't take a lot to put together either which is cool.Be sure to use a mat or have the machine on a rug. The way the thru bolts are positioned, you can scratch your hardwood floor pretty good like I did with mine. The bolts should've been able to be inserted the other way so the head of the bolt is pushed from underneath (the hole is counter sunk). The threads of the bolts stick out on the bottom and can scratch your floor really good if you lay the machine all the way flat.Otherwise, enjoy!!!"

287897,1,"It's hard to find a mid-priced, quality gi with drawstring waist pants (rather than elastic). This gi is all that. It's a medium weight, comfortable to move and train in, but with enough heft to feel ""real"". It is well-constructed, with gussets (extra fabric panels) in all the right places for ease of movement. Even with the hard style I study and our regular outdoor training camps, I expect that with proper care, this gi will last me many years. (I have owned it for two years so far.)My only suggestion for improvement is to sell the gi top and drawstring pants separately, but at an equivalent price per piece. As a woman, I would prefer to choose different sizes for top and bottom pieces of the uniform to ensure an ideal fit."
156586,0,"I have mixed feelings on the balance chair. My team of 3 people all ordered the chairs. We do sit up straighter, but have experienced back pains as well. I'm not sure why they charge $80 for the chair... it's just a ball on a cheap plastic frame, but I guess that's what new ideas sell for. If I had to do it again, I would make sure to have a chair to alternate with, since it's only tollerable for a portion of the day. We have gotten more used to them as we use them longer, but it's still a bit uncomfortable to sit on a rubber ball all day.By the end of the day, we are sitting in even more contorted positions than we would on a normal chair, so it's important to be very dedicated to good posture. We've only had them for a few weeks, so I haven't noticed any difference to my core strength yet."

If you need more room, the next step up is panniers."
356705,0,"I ordered this for a musical I am going to be performing in. I wanted an orange hoodie that wouldn't be too bright and not too dull. The picture looked like the perfect shade that I wanted. When I got it, I was surprised by how bright it actually was. It really is more like a safety orange than the color of an actual orange (fruit). I tried washing it to see if it would fade a little, but that didn't work. I did notice after the first wash, the lining on the inside began to release a lot of fabric like strings and snags. The pull string even came out after just the 1st wash.I will admit that I still like the the look of it despite it not being the shade I wanted. I will probably use it for when I run in the winter, but not for the purpose I purchased it for. I probably should have returned it when I noticed it wasn't the right color I wanted, but too late for that."

337240,1,"This pedometer is as accurate and as durable as they come! I have been using it on an elliptical machine that counts steps, and I can say that it is consistently within 5 paces of the actual count on the elliptical machine over the course of over 5,000 paces! It's not the cheapest pedometer out there, but if you want accuracy, this is the one to buy! As long as you do your part in accurately programming your pace length, it will also give you accurate mileage distance. The easiest way to verify this is to walk a measured distance (such as a quarter-mile track) and compare the results you get with your initial pace length setup, then adjust your pace length setup until your results match the measured distance. One caution: when the battery runs out the pedometer stops working and you lose your settings, so you have to re-program it when you install the new battery. Therefore, you should either memorize your set pace length or write it down so you can re-set it correctly."
137493,1,"I remember the inner tubes from cars so long ago and that's what I expected when I ordered this tube. What a surprise. The thick, wrapped rubber looks like it will last forever. I use this inner tube for back rehab in the swimming pool. After exercising, I go to the deep end of the pool and just dangle with the tube under both arms. This stretches out my spine and gives my bulging discs some relief. When I received the item, I was afraid the very long valve would poke me but I find that I don't even notice it. I have plenty of room (146 lb adult female)and since I never learned to swim, I use it to keep me afloat so that I can pseudo swim...it works!

478403,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."
52746,0,"If you are over 6 feet tall I would stay away from Russell items. I have had problems with the arms being too short in the past, but I figured I would try this ""nu blend."" Same problem- Russell seems to be under the impression that all athletes have short arms."

These were comfortable and fit well and they've worn well for the last 4 months. For me though, I like the Russell slightly more."

The small scissors come in handy for cutting open snack packages and the small screw driver is useful in opening up electronic items when it needs some repair.The tweezers and toothpicks fall off after a year or so. Most of the time without me finding out until it's gone. The toothpick is useful for resetting buttons on PDA's or digital wrist watches.

486452,2,"Boy, was I excited when I talked my wife into buying this bed to use on our visit to my mother-in-law's for the long Thanksgiving weekend. Being 6'4"" tall and a big guy the stay in the guest bedroom with it's ""I Love Lucy"" pair of Twin Beds on opposite sides of the room has become torture, they even have footboards. Putting this queen sized tall mattress in the middle of the room for us both to sleep on seemed to be a great solution, no more stiff necks or sore backs, I thought.Well it didn't really work out that way. The first night started out great. A very comfortable bed, firm enough, easy to set up, and we put our zip together sleeping bags on it and a long standing problem seemed to be solved. Then came the Weird Dreams in the night, Dreams of being the meat in a giant taco. When I struggled awake I found the bed had deflated. I was in the middle of a giant plastic taco shell, my wife mostly on top of me, my behind on the ground. I got up and re-inflated the bed and had to about every hour and 20 min. the rest of the night.We decided that waking every hour and a half to get up and go to the foot of the bed and blow it up again was still better than the Twin Beds so the second night was spent doing just that and all was pretty good that night, I learned to fill the bed up without really waking up so I got right back to sleep.Thank goodness we were spending only 3 nights, because on the third night we had another strange event. Maybe it was from the repeated re-inflations or maybe just poor construction but the bed, just after we got in, started making noise. Pretty soon we became aware that we had a lump, about the size of a golf ball between us on the top of the bed. A couple of inflations later, the golf ball had become a baseball. About 3 a.m. we were sleeping with a basketball in the middle of the bed. The one nice thing I can say about that is that it brought back happy thoughts of 20 some years ago and sleeping with my pregnant wife. I thought this was pretty funny, my wife not so much. When it was time to get up I jumped out of bed and my wife crawled out over the top of the medicine ball that occupied the middle of our bed. I guess the layers of plastic had separated. With a leak at the seam that couldn't be fixed and a ply separation the bed was unusable. I got home an checked with Amazon to return it but I had ordered it too soon. It seems that if you have it over 30 days before you try it, you can't return it. Not a mistake I plan to make again.If you go ahead and buy one of these I wish you good luck with it, who knows what might have happened if we had decided to get frisky."

I've had bursitis in my hips and knees, so I looked for a DVD that was low-impact. What I really like about this workout is that there are alternate forms for many of the exercises, which provides me with a way to complete the exercise without straining anything. There are some exercises here I just can't do, even with the alternate forms: the lunges and squats just aren't going to happen, so I'll walk in place until she moves on to the next exercise. I was very pleased with the variety of the exercises, and I thought the instructor was excellent. Even as a complete kettlebell beginner, I felt confident with her instruction. I just wish I could find more of her DVDs on Amazon!"

Shifted really nice, good overall performance.Now here we are today, a little over a year since I bought it. The thing is skipping/just not grabbing the chain. The teeth, while looking mostly OK, just aren't cutting it. This is maybe 800-900 miles in, 700+ of which are simple pedaling around campus. Whatever came with the bike lasted easily 2-3X as long, and with just the same amount of use/abuse.So, at least for me, this does not meet my expectations of durability. It rides well and performs great for everything I used it for, up until not, which included campus/general commuting, plus a full ride of the Kokpelli trail.Overall, I would recommend this, performance wise, and you really can't beat ~$30 for a cassette, but just don't kid yourself that it will last all that long."

This squeaking emanates from the connections to the rear parts of the foot pads where the cables connect. I am finally beginning to realize that this is an apparent design flaw that unfortunately has not been corrected with the Power Plus. We have oiled the connections and tightened the bolts that can be tightened but it does not improve it. There are also pieces of black that keep shedding off of these areas. I am truly disappointed since this is a great way to exercise without killing your knees! But I am not willing to keep replacing these Gazelles if they cannot fix the flaws, especially since the costs are much higher now."

I think this is a good value for the price. With a little adjusting, I molded the vest to fit my dog's body better. The straps don't seem to irritate her skin, but she doesn't swim a lot with it on. I have a lab, so it's not like she really needs it for swimming - it's mainly a precaution when we take her on a boat and also helps us get her back on the surfboard when we take her surfing and she falls off (the handle on the back is handy). Anyway, good value for the price but definitely a ""no frills"" option."
310103,0,While this shelter did indeed do as it was described as far as providing shelter for privacy. The set up was a pain and not as simple as one would expect. One of the expansion poles with the rubber tip was too big and had to be cut to fit into the next piece and the carry along bag ripped on the first use. It does do what it advertises but the set up is a pain!

Makes for a silly shoulder look, all those straps)I am a DD cup, but STILL, the hype was that this top would be as good as a Bella Bustiere (stunning support, Australian brand).In other news, it is a lovely fabric to wear, truly does wick away sweat like it claims (where does that word ""wick"" come from, anyway?) and it's got a lovely neckline."

I don't blame Kershaw for this, it is my own fault not checking the size with my other knife...The one problem is it rusts really fast. The blade tarnished within a couple weeks of use. No problem, just use a little steel wool and it comes right off. But, I would rather not have to mess with it.It is a guality knife, just heavy.I have relugated it to my toolbox and bought a smaller knife."

You have to pull them up while you're trying to work out or dance or whatever. They should return to the old formula."
57430,0,"I love this tool, and think it's my favorite as well as most carried. The weight is a bit on the heavy side, but a small price to pay for the larger blades and stronger pliers. The tool is larger then my Wave, however nothing ridiculous. Although I'm sure the QC will not take away from the general use of the tool. I was disappointed with the Surge compared to the Wave. Everything in comparison to the Wave seemed less smooth both in operation and overall finish.Although the Surge is not as well made as older Leathermans such as the Supertool, Wave, etc., it will still get the job done with ease. I prefer to carry my Surge with the extra bit kit."

I used this almost every day for six months and it looks brand new. Highly recommend it!"

18968,0,"From March till October this thing stays plugged into the back of my RV (I find the plastic shim to work adequately for a 4x4 receiver). I have to admit, I can't see what it's do'in back there (probably for the better), but it's got 20-some trips and three seasons to it's credit, I've never experienced any bicycular road kill and it doesn't ""swing"" side-to-side (there is play, I would suggest bungy'in it horizontally). It takes an origami-ish type talent to nest 4 bikes neatly w/o snap'in any spokes, but I can hang three 26"" mountain bikes and my son's 20"" BMX with little problem. Folks, this is one time that you get what you pay for. With this thing sell'in for sub-$80 at Walmart, it's surprising that it holds it's own weight. It is what it is...meant for applications where the bikes aren't going to be smack up against the back of your Lexus SUV. My only complaint is the rubber saddle/Velcro strap hold-down system. I've had two loops in the saddles rip rendering them completely useless and I can't find replacement parts anywhere. Once again, bungy's to the rescue. Also, unless you're oblivious to pain and frustration, don't even pull the pin and try pivoting the rack down w/ 4 bikes on it...a useless feature."

115564,2,This rain jacket is not breathable. They say it is because they have two small holes under something on the front of the jacket. Right where my backpack shoulder straps go. I think you would stay drier without the jacket in the rain. I put it on and I was drenched inside. This is a jacket you throw on if your running to the store. Absolutely not for any serious outdoor activity like hiking.

387824,0,"This item is not one of the best yoga mats but it does the deed. I mistakenly used sneakers and pressed the mat so hard it actually got rubbed down so I had to flip it. Barely any cushion so it is not comfortable but is effective for doing quick positions. I would not recommend this if you want a long term yoga mat. Get something sturdier and thicker.**Update: Dec 2012, I still use this mat for simple exercises and I have changed my mind in having this as a longer term yoga mat so I gave it another star!"
169100,1,The embroidery on this banner is very nicely put together and I have no worries of this ever fraying or coming apart. It comes with a dowel rod and string attached already for quick hanging in your man cave. Get one of these before the new logo comes out and you will not regret your purchase. Looks very stunning on my wall.
81610,0,"I loved this product. I had previously had a ""strap"" monitor and absolutely hated it (would be better if you had no chest). This watch never gave me any problems when it was working. Suddenly the watch would not provide a heart rate so I figured it needed a new battery. I took the watch to Sear's ""watch/clock"" repair department. When the service person took the watch apart, she placed the new battery in, and then put the watch back together. It would not even light up and she said they were not able to fix ""digital"" watches. She took out the new battery and gave me back the watch. I am not sure what happened, but the watch was lit when I gave it to her. I am thinking of buying the watch again because I really liked it and am familar with all of its features, but do not want it to only last a year. At least my ""strap"" monitor (Polar)has operated for many years and several battery replacements. I wish there were other reviews regarding battery replacements for this watch."

463904,2,"Carried this as an emergency pump and when the emergency came, I was luckily able to put a sufficient amount of air in the tire before the pump broke.The part that broke was the area of the nozzle that unscrews to switch between presta and schrader valves. It is also the locking mechanism and where the valve seals. The threaded male portion is very thin plastic.I would think this area would be more reenforced due to being the part that attaches to the valve itself.It is not fixable and with a tiny snap, the pump is useless."
504484,0,"Although I like the features of this Pedometer/Speedometer, I've discovered that it is not shock resistant. If if falls off you belt, you lose your stats. When on my bike, it periodically reverts to startup mode and stats are lost. The concept is great, but to be really reliable, more work needs to done on the design. Made in China like many low cost products now days. Guess you get what you pay for!"
113812,1,"I purchased this for my 2008 Nissan Altima, and it fits fine. The bottom clips can hook under the car like in the picture, or on the bottom of the trunk lid. My only concerns are that the metal clips seem to be chipping away the paint (nothing a little pipe insulator can't fix) and the straps are extremely long (to fit SUVs) so I have to tie several knots/bows to keep them from flapping. Holds both bikes without problems, and even if my front bike wheel turns a lot while driving, it doesn't hurt my car."
503236,0,Nice glasses for the $$. Was not worth sending them back. I think I will try the clear lenses next time. Smoke is too dark for most shooting.
289985,0,Good and bad for this jacket. First the price is to much. I paid $74.00 but it should have been lower because there is nothing to this jacket. It feels like your wearing a piece of plastic lined with netting. Yes it is waterproof but you better be wearing a flannel shirt underneath or you will freeze.The other good thing i can say about this jacket is the size was perfect. The sleeves are long enough for me as I am 5'8 and it is hard to find a jacket with sleeves long enough.
404825,1,"First, let me say that once you have this up, it works GREAT! It easily floods the court with light and provides great lighting for an entire half court. That being said (and the reason I give it 4 stars), the trick is getting it up. It may be easier if you have a Goalrilla backboard, but I have the Dicks' Sporting Goods brand, Goaliath. It has 4x4 posts instead of 6 or 8&#34; posts and this comes into play as there is not a 4&#34; mounting bracket for this device (even though the item description on Amazon says that it will fit a 4&#34;: post). As a result, I had to craft a spacer to put around my 4&#34; post to make it a 5&#34; post. Once that was done, I then had to figure out how to mount the light to my goal. The directions are missing an important step (i.e. -- when to attach the light pole to the goal post) so I had to figure it out solo. This definitely takes 2 adults and a good ladder to get into the right position. What finally worked was me on the ladder behind the goal and my brother in law in the bed of my pickup truck (parked under the basket) giving me some balance and a push on the lights from the front."
105062,0,I bought this because I bought a Wilson football on the first anniversary of 9/11 in 2002 the day that Johnny Unitas died and I found out by later watching a Yankees game on ESPN. I am the grandson of a Jewish European Immigrant and I thought the football kickers were always soccer players.

89647,0,"I purchased this bench only recently, so I may add to this review when I've used it more. But I wanted to give you my first impressions.As pricey as this bench is, my initial impression is that it Should Not have the ""Cons"" mentioned below. But unfortunately, at this price-point, there are almost no competitors that offer the 5.1's Flexible Positioning & Leg Attachment.CONs:> The Bench I received _Wobbles_ at the (pre-assembled) positioning-hinge;> There's a Wide Gap between the Seat & the Back-Rest in the Flat Position, which is mildly uncomfortable.> The two supplied allen wrenches are stubby & of poor quality; I recommend that you use goodquality allen wrenches so you can apply the necessary tightening torque.> The bench is packaged poorly: Mine arrived with a few holes punched into the box!Why oh why would a company of Bowflex's reputation present their product using cheap brown cardboard?On the plus side, the 5.1 is Still an impressive bench, specifically due to its very flexible positioning And the inclusion of a leg-brace--both of which strongly enhance its function."
197258,0,"I'm a big fan of IronMind's Captains of Crush hand grippers. Little makes me happier than seeing that the US is still making some of the highest quality products available. The same can be said for the ""Expand-Your-Hand Bands"". Yeah they are simply rubber bands and it is conceivable that you could perform the same excercise with common inexpensive bands of inferior quality. That said, these bands ARE ideally suited for the task... For MOST hands. But for those with large hands, you may be dissapointed as I was. My digits can comfortably span 7 inches apart without bands. However with the bands on I was only able to achieve 5.5 inches of seperation between any two opposing digits before reaching what I believe to be the functional limit of these bands. I had the same experience with all the included bands (so I don't think it was a limitation of my hand strength). I'm sure this product will be an excellent choice for most. But for those with large hands, you might want to explore other options. Hopefully in the future IronMind will release another line for varying sized hands."
115488,2,"it works. period. but it is like wearing a plastic bag...no breathing at all. You get very sweaty when it is closed up.....it is only good for heavy rain protection, but nothing else. Better to spend a few more dollars and get a material that is both waterproof and breathes."
440317,0,"These are decent pants. The wide elastic band is very comfortable. I had to modify the length and bell of the pants as they are a bit ""disco"" for my taste. The price for the pants is good, but the shipping and handling charge is excessive and a bit slower than other companies."

448194,0,"Like many other reviewers here, I can confirm the state of the lock here. It's a good basic lock with some solid security design features that might not end up in the generic U-Locks you find elsewhere.The mounting bracket is certified stupid, however. Definitely another confirmation for useless carry bracket for mounting. For those who cannot understand the possibility of this, the mounting bracket provides insufficient clearance for the end of the lock. You cannot fit the mounting slide onto the bracket because the bike frame gets in the way. If their mounting bracket were longer and more distant from the frame, this wouldn't be the case."
199651,1,"Great for the price. A little tricky to navigate through the features, but not too bad. Only real problem was it stopped working once when it was raining, but after it dried off it started working fine again. Also, it was very easy to set up and install."

81166,0,I bought this for my 7 year olds Cascade CS. It fits as promised covers about 85% of the face mask. I had just a minor issue with attaching the mouth piece after I put on the Face Shield. It's made of a very very thin plastic which reminds me of the plastic that a GI Joe action figure comes in. I was expecting something like the Under Armour Football Face Shield but that it literally 50x thicker than this. I guess they have to make it thin to fit multiple different brands. Finger prints and smudge marks from sweat very easy but that is expected all face shields I've used do this. Attaches with provided Velcro straps which is nice for easy removal and it's soft so you don't have to deal with zip ties.My sons review after one game:All the guys on my team loved my mask dad!I loved playing with it dad it didn't bother me at all...Overall for $20 I'll probably buy the smoke one also for sunny days I'm just worried my son's league won't allow it b/c of head injury cautions and concussions so they can see the players eyes.

Very good price for a very good stick."
213268,2,"I bought the Zooka a few years back when my son was in Little League, because I'm not the most accurate pitcher and I wanted to give him better batting practice sessions. On the up side, the Zooka is definitely safe, convenient, portable, and accurate. On the down side, the Zooka throws only sinkers, not true fastballs. The old-style rubber spinning wheel type pitching machine imparts backspin on the ball, which is the normal spin for a naturally thrown fastball. But the Zooka imparts a bit of topspin only, so the hitter is not really presented with a pitch that spins naturally. I hate to point this out, because I too spoke with the president at Zooka, and he and his staff are truly great folks. But unfortunately, I see this as a design flaw. The barrel of the Zooka is smooth and it imparts no spin on the ball, kind of like a knuckle-ball, so in order to get some kind of spin on the ball, they attached the curved rubber 'tongue' at the end of the barrel so that the bottom of the ball brushes against it as it leaves the barrel. This puts a little spin on the ball, but in the wrong direction, like a sinker. Even a fly-ball is naturally hit with back-spin. I wish there was a way to tinker with it and reverse the spin, but I can't think of one. However, the spin is perfect for tennis practice! Most ground strokes impart top-spin. I've used it this way many times with the autofeeder, and it's a great workout. I just haven't really been able to enjoy the Zooka for its true purpose."

469273,0,"connecting and reconnecting works perfect, better than all previous systems for attaching leaders to a flyline.But changing a flyline, for example from a sinking to a floating line is cumbersome. The line-end connector has to be removed by unknotting or cutting the flyline for attaching the connector on the new line.Necessary because the connector does not pas through the narrow topeye of the flyrod.Also the use of home-made leaders which some anglers prefer is very difficult if not impossible. It would help if the yellow tip-end connectors could be bought seperately for a fair price. These for connecting to selfmade leaders.Albert Mellink"

Company was very willing to send me new screws. anybody else with this problem?"
490085,1,My experience with the tent was really good. I camped for two days. The first night it rained. The tent leaked a minimally we were not uncomfortable. The next night we took the fly off and and slept soundly nobody had any complaints. Four people can fit comfortably inside. Set-up and take down was a breeze. Would reccommend if you looking for something for light camping.

463516,1,"I ordered this twinhead upgrade kit to replace a faulty smart-head pump from Serfas. The Serfas pump had a universal one-for-all(one hole) smart-head which worked fine at first with the presta valve on my bike. But after about 6 months, my son used the pump to inflate his soccer ball with the needle included. Since then the smart-head could not hold the preata valve firmly and leaked air always. I had to hold the pump head against presta valve with one hand and pump with another hand which was not easy to pump up to exact & high pressure. So I replaced with this twin head and it works very fine. I replaced it following one of the replacing instruction pictures included in the manual. I worried a little since this head is from Topeak and it might not fit to the Serfas pump but it fits well and also came with several extra parts and installing instructions to connect to different pumps in different ways. Anyway, this twinhead works fine with my Serfas pump and I guess the one-for-all smarthead may sound convenient but not always is the best choice. One thing, the higher-than-expected price made me to give 4 stars instead of five."

17610,0,"Several months ago I purchased 3 sets of these for my many night time, early morning or rain runs - and for the most part, I am very pleased. They are highly reflective, brilliantly colored, and definitely have proven their worth to me at least 4 times in oncoming traffic. The pop band is easy and fun, however...the only real difficulty I have found is that they are very stiff and have a tendency to create irritation from their ""sharper"" plastic edges. For example, you might want to be wary that wearing them around your ankles over bare skin and not over long pants can be pretty uncomfortable, with the edges of the band digging into your skin, causing small cuts. This is less of a problem around your wrists, given the motion of your ankles. But another thing to note is that they don't close cleanly around either ankles or wrists - there seems to be a little curve on the end that doesn't allow them to fit snugly and cleanly as the picture shows. Also, wearing them around biceps is fine, but they do tend to slip downward into the curve of your elbow. Wearing them anywhere but on the wrists requires constant adjusting and ""re-popping"" during your workout to get them to be comfortable again or stay put. Unfortunately, these challenges have actually led to a new search for something a little more friendly for wearing on bare skin (considering Jogalite cloth thin bands). All this being said, I still think they are fabulous for placement on a jogging stroller, bicycle, or over clothing. I've worn them in full out downpours and would definitely classify them as waterproof and easily cleanable, another plus. You won't go wrong with these, just remember that where you intend to wear them will make your experience happier or not. :)"

Pretty small leaks so nothing I'm too worried about but if this was a faucet that is always on, you might want to try something else."

47044,0,"I bought this pair of fleece pants (in Granite Heather) specifically for the brand reputation, elastic bottom hem and the fact that it's claimed to be a higher quality content of 80% cotton / 20% polyester. Granted, the material feels more premium than the $9 Fruit of the Loom sweats I picked up at wally world, but unfortunately it's still a thin and whimpy 50% cotton / 50% polyester. We'll see how well the material stands the test of time through wear and wash.I've been buying size medium for years without problem and all of a sudden, this pair of pants and the FotL's I bought a week ago hang so long that I have to hike the waistband up over my stomach to keep them from dragging under my feet. Did the definition for ""medium"" change when I wasn't looking? And to make matters worse, the cuff design exacerbates the long cut -- why put elastic at the bottom leg hem when it's not cinched any smaller at the ankles than the material? There is almost no bunching or pleating at all at the bottom hem. At least the waistband is sufficiently cinched so that I don't have to tie the drawstring to keep my pants up, unlike the FotL's.On the positive side, the pants are comfortable and feel good. Pockets are nice and deep and are made of a thinner jersey cloth, I'm guessing so they're not as bulky. Overall though, I can't help but feel I paid a premium just for the extra stitching and the embroidered Champion logo."
376193,1,"I needed two bike stands as my roommates and I have quite a few bikes together. After a while of online search, this one seems to fit the bill. I live in an apartment, and drilling on walls is not an option. So I order one from amazon right away, to see if it is really as good as the reviewers said.A day later, after a stroll in a local major department store, I found apprantly the same one for significantly less! So I thought this is the first time I got something for a higher price than in amazon. I bought it from the store right away. I unpacked it, and found the quality not to be as good as reviewed. The paint seemed like it will peel, and in some places it looks badly welded. In fact in the process of assembly, the threads on some of the screws got so badly worn I had to exchange for another one at the store. The exchanged one I got still has a worn screw in the vertical tube, and other assorted quality problems. The stand is holding up only because of gravity. So I thought I had a sub-par product, with another one coming.However, when I got one from amazon, I immediately noticed the difference. The packaging is different. The content is also different in small but significant ways. The design and the assembly instructions are the same, but the one from amazon has higher quality paint on. The screws and the hex key are much better. Instead of one hex key for all the screws as in the inferior version, there are two hex keys, each of a different size. The thicker hex key is used to tighten the arms, because that requires more force and thus more susceptable to thread wearing. I set it up without the problems I encountered in assembling the one I got from the major store. It's much sturdier. I can tighten the arms better without worrying about messing up the screws. It looks like the one amazon is selling is one that is improved over the initial design. So the lesson here is, get it from amazon, and don't be cheap. I noticed that amazon has another listing that has the same title as this one. I guess you don't want to touch that one, if that's indeed for the inferior version. As for this product, I highly recommend it for reasons stated in other reviewers, but order it here so you know you're getting the better ones. If not for the bad experience of getting an inferior version from somewhere else, I'd have given it 5 stars."

89371,2,"UPDATE: May 1, not quite five months since I finally managed to install these fenders, the front fender failed. I was making a slow turn into a bike lane when I experienced the much dreaded toe overlap - where the rider's foot interferes with the front wheel. This isn't uncommon with small framed bikes that have large 700c wheels but it's usually more of an annoyance than anything else.Maybe it was the pressure from my foot on the thin plastic that caused the front fender to fold under itself which resulted in the bike coming to an abrupt stop, causing me to fall. I can only be thankful that it happened in a buffered bike lane rather than in traffic, and that I only sustained a sprained wrist. I'll be removing these fenders as soon as I regain use of my left hand.==============Original ReviewIts been two days since the fenders arrived and I began trying to install them on my '04 Sirrus. I had previously usedPlanet Bike Hardcore Road Fenderso I presumed these would be similar. Right out of the box I noticed they appeared quite slim and although they're recommended for tires up to 700x28 they're a close fit on my Armadillos 700x25.The 42m bolt supplied was a bit too short for my Specialized Sirrus fork so I would up using the old bolt that originally came with the Hardcore Fenders. The plastic clip that secures the rear fender to the brake bridge was a press fit on my old Hardcore fenders and held the the fender firmly in place. On the Cascadia the same bracket has a loose fit and will slide up and down the fender. More importantly these fenders lack the metal tab that hooks onto the chainstay connector and helps keep the bottom portion of the rear fender in place.Like others have mentioned, I also had a bolt in the chainstay connector so I cut a slit to slide the fender over the bolt. What I didn't anticipate is there's very little clearance with the front Nexave Derailleur. As a result the fender is pushed back and winds up rubbing against the rear tire. While this worked perfectly well with the old Hardcore fenders, (secured by previously mentioned clip) apparently it wasn't sufficient for the Cascadia. The rear fender immediately began to rub against my rear tire.Further reading on Bikeforums indicates some Sirrus owners have gotten around the front derailleur problem by upgrading from Nexave to Tiagara which is a bit more work that I envisioned when I decided to add fenders. Maybe I'l just cut them back a bit and bypass the whole derailleur area.So far the only good thing I can say is that Planet Bike provided some long bolts that allow me to mount the fenders in the same eyelets as my rear rack. Now if I can only get the fenders installed securely that should be a real plus."
137816,0,Bought this racket from sports authority and the frame cracked on the second time I played with it. I didn't even do anything that would strain it. For the time I was able to use it...it generates a lot of power on its own. I had to adjust my gripping to accommodate for the natural power of the racket. Once I figured it out I began to like the racket. I would recommend insurance if the seller offers it.

I also decided to use it as a backup pillow and after deflating it just a bit, it saved my neck from cramping too. The only downside, and not necessarily a fault of the product, was the lack of back support. My companions had used a product that turned their air mats into chairs, and that would have been great if i could have done the same with this. Over all a great product."

263841,0,"I owned the larger gunvalut with sprint door for years and it is a great product. I purchased a new bed and didn't have the needed space to fit it under the bed so my solution was the MV500-STD.It seems to be well built and easy to use just like its big brother. One thing I really liked about it was how the top can fold far back making it very easy to mount it. No need to install bolts in your wall or floor. I just took some big wood screws and drilled them into the pre-made holes. Now it would take a crow bar and some persuasion to get it moved. Nothing someone could quickly grab or kicks could take.The down side to the safe is you push down on the keys to open it and it does not have very much resistance when popping open. If you push a tiny bit to hard on the last key stroke it will re-close the safe and you'll need to enter the code to try open it again. Additionally it is very smooth and somewhat hard to grab so if you do manage to not close the lid again after opening it the top can slip from your hand and close. I tried to remedy both of those issues with some velcrow. I used the hook side around the edge, to try and give my thumb something to grab onto. You could use skate board tape or tacky tap as well. I also folded a piece of soft velcrow about a 5 inch strip folded in half on itself. To make a soft band that I put on the edge and closed the safe. The safe pops open and the added resistance from the velcrow keeps the top open just enough to not reengage the and lock the lid down.I figure I would be under a good deal of stress when trying to open this thing up and last problem I need would be for the safe to continually close on me after I enter the correct code. It would be great if this had a nice spring that forcefully opened it. I may look into welding a small spring into the bottom later on.Overall, it is a decent safe for its size, ease to open and versatility. But being unable to open easily makes it loose a few points. If you can afford to fit the next step up GunVault with the spring door I would go for it hands down. But if you dont plan on mounting it or permanently a fixing it someplace. , maybe to leave in your car or in a bag.This does a great job."
53216,1,This holster has excellent quality and fits snugly.

60069,2,"I really wanted to like this seat. I road it several times over several days for a total of about 50 miles! The pains in my posterior kept increasing until I could not push myself to ride it anymore. My hips also began to hurt. If this was the only seat in the world I would quit bike riding.The Hobson seat is fairly creative in design, and contrary to other reviews, it seemed to me to be fairly well made. I had no major issues with the quality of materials or workmanship. The seat is also pretty light weight, and it looks sort of neat. The problem for me was my sit bones (or the muscles/fat that covers them) just plain hurt on this seat. I made sure that I was positioned just right within the depressions in the pads. I tried repositioning, adjusting and readjusting 20 times or more. I tried sitting more forward, and more back, and more upright, and lower, and higher, and everything in between, but nothing helped. I even gave my bottom time to heal somewhat between rides, but it quickly remembered what had caused it so much pain 2 days before.So far this is the worst seat I've ever used. Had to send it back. I previously tried the Ergo Ultimate nose-less seat, and although I ended up returning it, it was much closer to being comfortable than this one.For reference I am a 58 year old male, a little over 5' 8"" tall, and about 170 lbs. People with different anatomies might have a better experience, although its hard for me to imagine how.I gave this Hobson 2 stars for innovation, even though my bottom is screaming ""0 stars""!!! Maybe their other seats are better (or so I would hope)."

452546,0,I own a Smooth Fitness treadmill and had not applied any silicone lubricant since purchasing the treadmill a few years ago. It was getting a little noisier so I tried this lubricant. So far it seems to accomplish what it's supposed to although application is tough. The treadmill belt on the Smooth fits so snugly that it is hard to lift it up to spray underneath. I noticed that some of the other lubricants have special applicators and may have to go in that direction next time.

225597,0,"After using this saddle for a couple weeks, the mounting rails gave and folded up completely below the cushion. This also caused the seat to flex downward on the outside edges becoming painfully uncomfortable for the last 6 miles or so of trail. Once I got home and examined it I was stunned, especially because I was on some simple DH most of the time and stayed out of the saddle majority of the ride.The short time that it lasted, it was pretty comfortable. Not the best saddle but by far not the worst. I don't know if this was a fluke or what, but it doesn't seem to be a common problem that I've heard of. All well, I will move on and find another saddle... but for now the stock one will do. Planet Bike products are normally pretty solid, so this doesn't deter me from purchasing their other items.. but this is being returned defective.EDIT: 09/26/2012 - Of course Planet Bike had no problem taking the saddle back defective.

127569,0,"(Please note that the DVD included in this kit is NOT the same Yoga Burn DVD that is sold alone; for more information, visit the Gaiam web site and seach for ""yoga burn kit."")The Yoga Burn Kit comes with a workout DVD plus weighted gloves that are supposed to help specifically target the upper body during the exercises. The weight of the gloves is adjustable--10 small, rectangular-shaped weights, each weighing .25 lbs., are included, allowing a total weight of up to 1.5 lbs. for each hand. The weights go into slots which circle your wrists, which I found to be rather uncomfortable; in addition, the gloves themselves were bulky, and the elastic around the edges was uncomfortable as well.Yoga Burn is led by Rodney Yee but performed by his current girlfriend, Colleen Staidman, who does not speak. I found that Rodney's interaction with Colleen seemed rather forced--surprisingly, I thought he had a much better chemistry with Mariel Hemingway in the Yoga Now videos. Basically, the workout consists of a series of slow, flowing movements, most of which are repeated three times. Beginning in staff pose, there is a sequence where you lean back, circling your arms and tightening your core, which didn't feel very intense to me. Next, you'll do some side crunches and twists in a reclined position; again, these were very gentle. Moving to a seated position, you'll do seated eagle--a nice stretch, especially with the gloves--and then move to a squat with a bicep curl.Standing poses follow, beginning in a straddle position for a wide-legged forward bend. Traditional standing poses are performed here, including warrior 1 & 2, triangle, and side angle pose, but again, arm movements are added and generally repeated three times. Moving to a stomach-lying position, you'll do cobra, lifting and lowering to a slow 10-count. Final poses include a 1-legged forward bend, back release, and savasana, bringing the practice in right around 40 minutes.I found this practice to be quite disappointing. As mentioned previously, I found the gloves to be quite uncomfortable, which was definitely a distraction. Also, although the gloves did add a bit to some postures, such as eagle, overall, I didn't find them to be much of a benefit. Similarly, I just really didn't feel like I got much out of this practice; it didn't feel particularly strengthening, and I didn't find it to be particularly relaxing either. I think that this video might be best suited to someone who is relatively new to yoga and/or someone with limited flexibility looking for a gentle practice with a slight twist."

331145,0,"That train's never late. Like clockwork, Madden is back for another go around of NFL action, and thankfully, this year's edition manages to change a few things up to set it apart from it's predecessors. Madden NFL 08 may signal the franchise showing it's age on the PS2 (the graphics engine is more dated than ever), yet there are a nice number of gameplay tweaks and improvements to distract from this drawback. The players themselves control and act more realistically this time around as well, which is really saying something considering the game still suffers from the cardboard AI opponents the longer you play the game. Along with some frame rate issues, the flaws of Madden NFL 08 are outshined by it's positives. Online play is a breeze to set up, and there's still plenty of nuances and modes of play for armchair quarterbacks to enjoy. Not to mention that Madden is still the only NFL licensed video game around, so it's not like you really have much choice as it is (thanks EA). All in all, Madden NFL 08 is a solid entry in EA's big time cash cow franchise, and even in the late life of the PS2, Madden still comes out on top."
495093,0,"At the time I bought it, the price on this was very low, and I was half-expecting something cheaply made. I mostly wanted to try out a clip watch to see if I would wear it. It actually seems reasonably well made.There is, however, a major flaw. Assuming that what you intend to do is clip this on yourself, e.g. on a belt loop, it's upside down. What you want is to be able to reach down and lift the thing up so that you can read the face. When you do that, 6 is at the top and 12 is at the bottom. Major bummer.And you may think well, I'll just flip it all the way over (270 degrees instead of 90). But the clip is too short to do that comfortably.So I started wearing it on the belt loop on my left side, and reading it sideways. I can sort of do that, but I would of course much prefer to just be able to hang it from a front belt loop and read it easily.Also note that this is JUST a watch -- no date, no alarm, etc. And the bezel (which would look nicer if it were brushed, like the rest of the metal) is not movable -- it is not a separate piece.So I would say that unless you were planning to hang this from something besides yourself, so that you will be looking at it right side up, you probably wouldn't be happy with this. I give it 3 stars just because somebody might actually plan to hang it on, say, their backpack, in which case you want this orientation."

I couldn't be happier with my choice. The field of view (330' @ 100 yrds)is perfect for birding, making it easy to follow a bird as it flies from perch to perch. The color optics are amazing, as I've never seen the plumage so clearly before. This binocular in particular is nicely streamlined on account of the roof prisms, not bulky like the NatureView Plus 8 x 42. I highly recommend purchasing these great binoculars."

156035,0,"Contrary to the product description, the one I've received is 19 oz, and there isn't any easy way to replace the weight bolt. It seems that all MFH2X60 series come in two flavors - 19 or 20 oz. If you really need to specify the weight, you'd better look elsewhere. On the other hand, this is a pretty good beginner cue stick. When the two pieces are put together, the center of mass is about 4.5'' from the top edge of the grip. I'd have given it 4 stars if those ""Made in China"" labels weren't so hard to remove (in fact, I had to use isopropanol to clean off the adhesive residue along the shaft)."
223180,0,"(1) I rate this product a lowly 3 because the speed readout steps up in only half mile an hour (or kilometer per hour) increments, (rather than tenth mile per hour increments), meaning it will jump from say 20.0 mph to 20.5 to 21.0 . Thus you won't see if you're beginning to trend up or down until you've changed speed by as much as around 0.6 mph, which is a notable speed difference on a bike. Paradoxically, max speed, average speed, and the trip odometer are precise to the hundredth mph (or kph), so internally the device measures to the hundredth of a mile per hour and the designers, inexplicably, purposefully degraded the CURRENT SPEED display.(2) Even though you're running a wire to the chain stay anyway for the cadence pickup, the speed pickup is on the front wheel, meaning it won't measure speed when you're training on a stand or rollers.(3) If you've ever installed a cyclocomputer before, you'll probably have no difficulty installing this one in around ten minutes; if this is your first, then the instructions might turn you into a bitter, hateful person. The rubber band mounting system might also present challenges for mounting on non-standard frames, though that can probably be overcome with some bits of old tube folded over.(4) After testing this for 25 miles on a route with a few surface bumps and some rough pavement, I haven't yet found any of the pickups or mounts to have shifted, but I can see how I might accidentally kick the cadence pickup someday with my foot. Whatever the logic, the rubber-band system for holding most of the components in place is not, in my view, as secure and stable as cable ties and screw-clamps. The mount for the computer unit itself will slip around unless you use the provided two-faced tape, which means that - despite the rubber band system - wherever you mount it initially is supposed to be permanent.(4) Finally - although this might just be due to my inexperience with the unit - the mode and set/reset buttons are opposed to each other at the upper and lower edges of the computer, so if you want to cycle through the displays of say Mode 1 - which you would press with your thumb at the bottom right of the unit - you have to be sure to not squeeze the Mode 2 button, which is at the top right of the unit. That's not the biggest problem, but if you're moving, it's a nuisance you'd rather avoid.FOLLOW UP: After a few weeks, in addition to confirming my initial impressions, I have found that the unit dismounts too easily. Twice it has flown to the ground, once while I was using the reset function (which means pushing a button on the upper left which might twist the unit counterclockwise and thus dismount) and once when I had been stopped and most have tapped the side of the unit without even realizing it (I went back to find it on the ground after I started moving and it wasn't there).BOTTOM LINE: The Sigma 1606L is sold here at a good price considering its numerous functions including cadence, but the CURRENT SPEED display reads in only 0.5 mph/kph increments and (at least for this rider) that profound deficiency almost completely devalues the product. The mounting system is also way too loose, and the unit can EASILY be lost. The placement of the buttons is a problem since pressing two of the four can cause the unit to dismount. The button logic is also annoying. Admittedly, this unit has more (and possibly an excess of) functions than most other units, but there are two-button cyclocomputers which can more quickly navigate you through the menu. From one's armchair, this unit looks reasonably intelligent, but on the road it is very deficient. For those whose use of the computer is relatively minimal, the design might be entirely fine, but if you continually attend to your cyclocomputer readout while you're riding, this unit is not for you."

509393,2,"I would definitely go with something else if you want a pedometer that actually counts your steps. Sometimes it seems to count about 1/3 of my steps, and sometimes closer to half. If it were consistent, capable of any precision at all, it would be usable. But since there's no way to accurately guess the number of steps walked based on the pedometer's count, it's essentially useless.I've tried counting my steps and then reading the meter, and I've tried walking known distances and then checking the count, and there's no consistency. I can walk the same course on consecutive days and this pedometer thinks I've gone 50% farther the second day as the first.I think the reviewer who commented that it's too cheap to bother to send back is on to something: Sportline can sell junk, and if it's not sold in a brick and mortar store, no one will bother to return it, and they profit."

You would need so many sets that it would be extremely costly. Instead make your own weights with sand, cinder blocks, or cement. Much more cost efficient."

204707,0,"This lighter works great when you're at sea level, and if that's your goal then look no further. It is well built, and lights very easily when enough oxygen is present.If, on the other hand, you take this lighter backpacking at elevations higher than 8,000 feet, then your mileage may vary. It takes a lot of convincing to light at all at these elevations, and you may find yourself without a flame at all.The instructions advise you use premium butane fuel, and to set the fuel level to the lowest setting when at higher elevations, both of which I did. Unfortunately it still took 10-20 ""clicks"" before I got any sort of flame, which is unacceptable."
309487,0,"I bought the 3XTA after having the Eureka Timberline2 for many years. I wanted something bigger than a 2 man and this does the trick. It is great for 2 people but 3 would be cramped if you start bringing in your packs.Pros - Easy to set up and light weight. No problems for one person to set up and move around before putting the stakes down.The mesh is really tight and if noseeums are a problem for you, this will stop them.Having a door on each side allows each person to get in and out without bothering the other.Cons - Be careful when setting up as the side with the little triangle window (the ""!"" logo) really needs to be facing towards the lowest grade of incline. We were almost flat but still had the window at the highest grade. It rained the 2nd night and although no rain got in, the rain slides right down the fly and over the window. This then leads to rain running under your tent instead of the ground tarp. Tent was wet between ground tarp but bone dry between ground and tarp. Glad I sealed everything even after factory tape seal.Also, I miss being able to open a window without having the world look in. If the fly is open (for a breeze) you have no protection from people looking in. And it is either all or nothing to have it open.Lastly, the fly zipper is really long. To get out, you have to reach all the way across the open ground to grab it. Tough if it rains and there is mud right outside your door. As soon as you open the fly, you will get rain coming into your tent through the mesh. Since the zipper head is at the ground level, it gets mud and dirt on it so it makes it tough to zip up or down.Overall, I would probably not buy this again. At least not for my purposes. I'll probably buy a 4 season tent and use this as a back up or for the kids. At least the price was really good. Glad I only spent $161 on it."

Also, I don't believe that you can get a complete workout with the tubes. It may be possible but, I didn't see how (some of the stances on the chart look good on the chart but seemed pretty useless to me, plus the door attachment, though efficient, constantly worried me (I've been smacked in the face with another brand tube before...not fun).

He is really hard on his clothes and these shirts have held up to his running and training and my subsequent washing and drying. The shorts and running pants we purchased at the same time have long since been replaced, but these shirts carry on with no pilling, no holes, and no irritating permanent smelliness. I have no idea how they do it, but I would buy them again in a second. Mr. MVP is a big guy and he fits comfortably in a XL.**After purchasing more of these shirts Mr. MVP now runs 10 to 12 miles 4 to 6 times each week and fits in a L.

My recommendation is to use fun-tak or tape to hold it in place so it won't fly off."

138408,0,"A good idea, good Amazon price and if used in impeccable setting will do the job it's advertised for. It is useful but you must realize that nature is not as precise as the presumptuous ideas of humans.The quality is already reviewed by others here. You need to change the lanyard attaching the rope to the weights bag, maybe the cord. Minor things. Somebody has to make a profit. It's still a good price.Two stars off and you should be aware of:First: It will pinch the chain sometimes. The cutting blades are farther spaced chain saw type of blades, so it's does help with binding but not eliminate it all the time. Be prepare to loosen it then, by ladder or some other method. I used water pipe with a garden type hand saw attached, but you have to get up there, so the ladder approach that you were avoiding might be needed. Its troublesome if it's rather high.Second: you might cut through most of the branch, but it might peel down instead of simply breaking. Now you have a branch hanging down by a slice and now you are back to almost square one, having to start a new cut closer to the tree and below the original cut but hopefully with less gravity on the branch that you can then make a complete cut.Overall, if you plan it right, it will work but likely not simply throwing it up and singing hi ho here we go!Good value though and some lower branches no big deal.BTW I used it on oak and maple, bout 6 /8 in.dia. Greater than 20 ft high branches. As for throwing the weight bag I could have used more pitching time in HS. My golf stroke no help."

I bought the medium bag, but probably would have been happy with a small for road-biking.I like the bag but am giving it 4 out of 5 stars for the style factor. The straps hang out after getting everything adjusted. The seat-post strap leaves a lot of extra strap that is not in contract with it's velcro mating surface. The main zipper-pull feels like it might not be too sturdy. Will see how it lasts.Groovy bag. Good price."

I bought this watch nearly 3 weeks ago and it is still in my rack, unused. Either amazon must have asked for my wrist size before delivery or should have guided me with the means to get the chain resized.

362020,1,"I recently completed Phase 1 of RevAbs and about to start with Phase 2. So far I really like it! The workouts have the right intensity for someone who is somewhat in shape already. Not too extreme, yet a really good challenge. And with only 30-40 minutes per workout it won't cut into your evening like some of the longer programs out there.As the title suggests, this program is all about getting your abs ripped. And Brett Hoebel, the trainer, made a science out of it. The comprehensive program comes with a nutrition guide with some neat meal ideas, a results tracker and tape measure (which I never used), the Anytime, Anywhere, Abs folder plan (this one comes in handy when I travel for business) and a wall calendar to track my progress. The poster-like calendar hangs in my basement where I work out. My greatest pleasure is to check off each exercise as I plow through the workout every day. Love it.Does it work?After 4 weeks I have lost several pounds in my mid section, thanks to more conscientious eating and, of course, the rather cardio-heavy Phase 1 exercises. I can't wait to start with Phase 2 to really chisel my abs. I definitely start to see some definition and that's very motivating.Overall, RevAbs is a really fun and well thought-out program. The trainer Brett is entertaining and has an infectious energy. Give this one a try!"

I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS. The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it. This was emailed from Zac. I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number. I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon.

The major downside is that the Avent caps leak a tiny drop of liquid after each drink. Liquid traps inside the plastic disk and then bubbles to the surface. If the kids lick it off, it's not a problem. If they don't, it runs down the side. This only happens after they take a drink. Still, for the price of these sippies, one would hope for zero problems. I don't own a Sigg, so am not sure how these would compare. As for Klean Kanteen's non-sippy styles, I would expect that they work well, since the problem is the sipping lid made by Avent."

402207,1,"My 3 year old son wanted to be a football player for Halloween, so we purchased this for him and he LOVES it. He has worn the helmet every day since we got it (close to 2 months now) and it often goes to the grocery store with us. It's still a little bit big, but he doesn't care. :) I sewed up some makeshift football pads for him to wear, and he looked the part. The uniform was still too big, but that means he can wear it for years to come!"
508699,1,this bike rack worked wonderful on my matrix its very easy to set up the bikes didn't budge we put 2 adult bikes on it and they were very sturdy the wheels didn't even move at first it looked hard to hook up but once you figure it out its really easy its already put together its just a matter of getting the strapes arranged good quality
382270,2,"I wish I had read the reviews. Got this for my 11 year old who is very slim and it is way to small. I called Markwort and though they were nice enough they insisted they had been selling it for years and it should work and that I was using it wrong. Don't know how you could could use something so simple incorrectly. Anyway, will have to modify it to work. Should have just bought some velcro and made one myself if I am going to have to modify this one."

95186,1,"I was afraid that this workout would be way too much for me to do since I'm still recovering from a severe ankle break (after 18 months), and I'm really out of shape and a large girl. But I've been doing the program for about 2 weeks and I just modify everything I can't do. For instance, when he's doing the power jumps, I just do knee lifts as high as I can. When he does the jumping jacks, I do single jacks. I may not be anywhere near being able to do all the stuff on this DVD but at least I'm finally back to a regular routine. I definitely recommend it. Don't let it intimidate you! Let it be something to work towards. I look forward to the day when I can do some of those harder routines!"
8718,0,"I use a Giant Transend LX (the Honda Civic of commuter bicycles) to do my daily commute to work. It's about 8 miles each way, mostly through neighborhoods and a few short stretches of busier roads. I bought this mirror because it received excellent reviews, and I didn't think I could get used to a helmet-mounted mirror. I'm pretty good about turning my head to check for traffic, but I thought that this might be better since I wouldn't lose sight of what is in front of me when I check.I received it quickly after my order, but found installation to be less than simple. For my bike, the end caps on the bars come off easily, but neither the large nor the small ""wedge"" that came with the mirror fit into the hole properly. The large was too large, the small was too small. Let me explain the wedge system. While the photos show the mirror fitting snugly into the handlebar end, in fact it will not look like that for most bikes. A piece with a larger circumference attaches to the bottom section using a bolt and screw. The tighter the screw, the more the wedge-shaped piece moves toward the rest of the arm. I found that if you tighten it completely, the wedge moves past parallel with the arm. It's difficult to explain, but the wedge system is not well made.I ended up ignoring both wedges and just used a nail to act as a shim between the normal arm piece and the handlebar hole. It's stable and snug. My only other option would have been to file down the larger wedge until it fit properly.That said, now that it is in place firmly, the mirror itself is great. It is just rounded enough to provide a view of a whole suburban street, and shaking is minimal."
303721,1,"I wanted to try P90X and had never really engaged in any sort of work-out routines. Personally, I was not looking to lose much weight, but just be more fit. The workouts are fun, but challenging. I couldn't do 1 pull up or more than a couple push ups when I started, so I was pretty out of shape even though I wasn't overweight. the workouts ARE doable, but you will be sore! I highly recommend it if you are serious about a new committment...it is about 1.5 hours 6 days/week. Even though it seems like a lot, I liked the fact that there was an 'end' to this workout program. You can then continue another round or maintain what you've done afterwards instead of starting to exercise and thinking ""I just have to do this forever now"". I highly recommend the program. P.S. we did the diet plan (as best we could) along with it (protein shakes, bars, recovery drink... the whole bit) and I would recommend that as well."
407179,1,"Had the opportunity to use our new stacker kayak carrier this past weekend. Took two kayaks up to the Finger Lakes, about 200 miles from home. With a little practice we got the time to load and strap down two kayaks down to 10 minutes. The stacker provides a very stable base to attach two kayaks. Even at 70+ mph the kayaks remained stable and remained in place. This model also folds down when not in use. The are held in place with 4 bolts that along with an adapter plate that comes in the kit hold the stacker firmly to the side-to-side roof rack that came on our vehicle. The price was less than the price of two sets of ""J"" shaped kayak carriers and worked very well. My only addition to the set-up was the use of a ""noodle"" to pad the roof rack. System worked very well. Would recommend this system to other kayak users."
382177,0,"I'm going to break this up into two chunks: lenses and frame. I'll rate them separately, because some people may be more interested in one than the other.First of all, it's not stated in the description at all, but the glasses come with a sturdy, semi-flexible nylon case. It's a great case. It has very soft, padded protective material on the inside and is built to keep the glasses from moving around in transit. It also has a clip on one end, if you want to attach it to something. You'll also get a microfiber cleaning cloth, as well as the requisite company logo sticker.So, the glasses. As has been stated in the 2 previous reviews, the frame is pretty awful. Think gas station sunglasses. The ""Titanium"" part of the product description refers to the seemingly spray-painted silver color. Looking at the inside of the hinges, it is apparent that the ""titanium"" color IS in fact painted on -- the inside of the hinges are black, with a bit of overspray on the edges. This is inexcusable. That said, it hasn't peeled or come of at all for me (yet). The frames are extremely light weight too, which surely contributes to the cheap feel.All in all, the frames get ONE lousy star. Here: *Now for the lenses. The lenses are excellent! I don't know what the transmission is, but it seems to be just about perfect for me -- great for toning down the bright midday Florida sun, but not as dark as many similar sunglass lenses are. The quality of the lenses is obvious as soon as you put them on, absolutely zero distortion and excellent retention of detail. These are up there with the best lenses I've ever looked through. Only time will tell if they can hold up to the rigors of daily use without excessive scratching. I'll update my review as I take them out to do the things I bought them for - riding the motorcycle and kayaking, mostly.So the lenses easily get 5 stars from me! *****Average them out, and there's your three-star review. :-)One final note -- they seem to be shaped well for windy situations, keeping your eyes protected. At speed on the motorcycle, there's enough circulation to keep your eyes comfortable, while keeping out those eyeball-tornadoes that make your eyes water with lesser glasses on. :-)"
160404,2,"These skates feel like skating through gravel. The wheels are made of plastic (not rubber), are flat around the edges so do not turn easily, make skating difficult and slow, and for some reason made me shock everyone that I touched. I asked whether buying new wheels for them would help, but was told to purchase new skates and save the aggravation. The sizes run large and there is little padding. I would not buy them for anyone. Very disappointed."

42582,0,"I'm into my 7th workout of the 6 week challenge and have these thoughts:Pro:These are really good workouts. I think this is what people thought Wii Fit would be. I like the mix of cardio, full body and upper and lower body choices.At the end of them I am sweating and the next day I've been sore.The trainer and ""show me how"" videos make it easy to learn the movesYou can choose to skip exercises at the beginning of the workout and it calculates your calories based on your choices.You can follow the 6-week challenge or create your own workout.Con:The resistance band offers very little resistance even at very short lengths. I tried holding my own free weights and the wii remote in the same hand but it slipped around and I felt like I would crack the wii-mote when I squeezed it against the dumbbell bar. To make up for it, I do a set with my own weights and then repeat the set with the band just so I get the credit and the calorie count on my graphs.The leg thing is uncomfortable. Attach it tightly to stay on, it feels like a tourniquet and if you attach it loosely, it sometimes slides off during jogging. To remedy this, I wear shorts with deep pockets and stick the nun-chuck in the pocket. It works well for the weight routines and running but not so well for water-skiing and lunging. For those I still have to use the Velcro leg thing.My big complaint: the Wii remote and nunchuck seem out of sync with some of the exercises. When I try to do crunches with punches, the trainer says ""too fast, too slow, try again,"" over and over, even if I am just laying there. I end up doing the crunches on my own and then faking out the software with hand gestures. Its also frustrating when I want to get into a good routine of doing 15 crunches and I have to either wait, try again, hold it, start over or watch the videos to satisfy the trainer... it takes 5 minutes to do a set of wii crunches that take only 30 seconds in the gym.The controls are sometimes inconsistently unresponsive so if I swat the ball 10 times in a row in squash, the 11th time my arm won't move for 3 seconds and then it'll swing to catch up. And with water-skiing, I'll successfully squat 5 times in a row and the 6th time I miss the flag even though I am moving the exact same way as before.It's not very fun. The exercises are the same basic ones you can do on your own: lunges and crunches and bicep curls with weights. No hula hooping, skiing or snowball fights (like the wii). True, there is water skiing but that is basically squatting down and up and there is squash but that consists of mainly swinging your arms, lunging and swattingat the ball on a drab court by yourself. Would be fun if it were more like Wii tennis with a crowd, good scenery and partners.For the longer workouts, you end up repeating the last 5 exercises you just did. Gets a little old.The trainer is annoying sometimes. When he says ""niiiiice!"" I kinda want to smack him. I like Wii Fit's mellow, unobtrusive trainer.So despite the long list of cons, I am still happy with the software. I feel like I am making much more progress toning up than with the wii fit and that was the whole point of buying the software."
145026,0,"These socks have a weird grainy feel to them. To me, they are not soft and feel stringy around the ankles..."
25126,1,"This is a great product! A lot of people have been commenting that the rope is hard to adjust and that had me worried for a while but when I got my product in the mail, i saw you can just pop the cap off the end of the handles (very easy to do with a flat surfaced tool (flat screwdriver/scissors). You then pull out the rope, cut however you want to cut and clamp down the extra metal clasp that's included inside the handle. REALLY EASY. I dont understand why other people had such a hard time. have fun on your workouts!"
372471,1,"These are impressive looking hammers, but they arrive in pieces that require assembly. The assembly is easy, but I was dismayed to find that the languets (the steel sides below the head) are actually separate pieces. The screws supplied to attach them do not seat completely flush, and they are so mild that, even with pre-drilling the holes, some of the heads snapped off before the screw was fully seated. I am surprised,because Cold Steel usually makes some fine weapons. On a side note, the 30"" handle is a bit awkward for single-hand use, but a bit short for two-handed. Also, if they are to be used in any combat scenario, the rear spike is rather sharp, and needs to be dressed down for safety."

230780,0,"Bought this as a gift for my wife and she seems to like the bar. However, as with many of the other reviewers on here, the bar arrived with no collars. The box clearly states on the package that it includes 1 bar and 2 collars yet they can't seem to put the collars into the box based on many of the reviews on here. I guess I'll have to contact the manufacturer as one of the other reviewers suggested and see if they'll send them to me. If not, I guess it will be going back."
58814,0,"Amazon was quick to ship and the product is reasonably well made. Great idea. I mounted my speedo and hi-power flashlight to the bar. Everything works great...except... the mounting bar does not swivel left to right. This is a problem with the flashlight. The Topeak Bar Extender is limited to the angle of your handle bar where you attach the unit. If that angle is wrong, that is when the flashlight is on and the beam is not directed ahead, that toooo bad. I had an extra flashlight mounting attachment that not only would hold the flashligh but would allow a left to right swivel so that I could center the flashlight beam straight ahead.Everything else works."

335256,2,"I consider myself pretty healthy - I exercise 5 days a week using a combination of cardio / weights, swimming and yoga and eat a healthy diet but I am always looking for new tips and advice!This book offered both the good and the bad! To being with I appreciated the background of why this plan came to be, but as I continued reading, there was a little too much self fulfilling about why this program was the best thing ever and why you should abandon many traditional forms of exercise - there are folks that do yoga, weight lift or run who are in the greatest shape of their lives yet according to this book, you should initially abandon all of the above and only follow the forms of exercise in this book! Many people who are looking to get into shape may find themselves more motivated when they can incorporate some other forms of exercise which they currently enjoy I felt there were too many chapters devoted to how this program came to be and found myself skipping over some of the repetition in order to get to the actual plan!Now the exercises were great - this is a good common sense approach to exercise and the movements certainly gain results! Small but calculated moves targeting different muscle areas as well as the chance to change the workouts every 10 days keeps if fresh and effective - you will certainly feel it! The included DVD makes this book well worth the price and you will find yourself with excellent cardio and muscle targeting exercises that will tone your body and help you develop strong lean muscles that will help you look good and burn fat! Though I work out frequently, I certainly felt the effects of this program!Where this book really becomes a let down, is in the terrible menu section! Healthy eating is important when seeking results - exercise and eating go hand in hand in hand! This book has its ideas right when it tried to incorporate treats into the meal plan, because often diets are too restrictive and ask you to abandon all favorites which is when the average person feels deprived and is more likely to binge or abandon the plan! However simply incorporating 'treat' items does not make a diet effective or healthy!As a vegetarian, as others have remarked, on some of the days the calorie content was well under 1000 calories! Sustained eating at this level together with exercise is too restrictive - the average person would give up quickly due to that sense of deprivation, but beyond that such low calorie content with intense exercise, plus everything else the average person has to do in a day will certainly result in weight loss, but it will also long term potentially damage the metabolism - the body sensing deprivation, will slow down, in trying to protect itself so as soon as you try and eat a normal calorific amount, you might be more apt to gain weight! One can eat at least 1500 calories a day with an intense work out session and still get in shape! The diet was also lacking in nutrients - most days I did not see an abundance of fresh fruit and veggies, nor did I see the protein and carbs the body would require to stay full and develop more lean muscle mass!Its a shame, as we have excellent exercise advice with terrible dietary advice - sure if you followed the book you would lose weight - and maybe that is what the author is looking for, but generally this diet is far too low calorie to be healthy! A short term fix to a good body, is not a long term fix to great health!"
394554,2,I'm usually a Med so I got a Lg to make sure they were cozy as I wanted them for just wearing at home.I am returning the Lg and getting the XL only b/c I wanted cotton and they are fairly well priced.the sizing is VERY off though. go up at least 2 sizes ladies if you are planning on buying them.
411445,0,"On one side, the legs bend inward, then outward. The other side, with straight legs, has a 'stabilizer' bar that screws onto them. Obviously there were problems with these tipping over, and the 'solution' was to add this screwy bar, which DOES NOT lay flat on the ground, or have any rubber/vinyl feet.The grill legs CAN NOT be folded (or unfolded) with the stabilizer attached. So if you thought (like I did) that this would be more 'convenient' than the cheaper model, with the screw-on legs, you are wrong. It would be MUCH easier to assemble the cheaper grill with the detachable legs, than use this with the recommended safety stabilizer bar.The legs ONLY fold one particular way, and the stabilizer bar (not shown on the product image) must be removed to fold or unfold the legs. The stabilizer bar is difficult to install/remove. They didn't... quite... get the legs and welded-on leg sockets lined up. So you get to fight with removing it, to get it off, and fight with it to get it on. I've already 'shaved' plastic off the caps on the bottom of the straight legs, and some paint, trying to fit/remove the bar.General fit and manufacture are about what I expected of mass produced sheet metal and tubes construction. It is no lightweight breeze to carry, the fold-over table sides DO NOT clamp, as they appear to be designed to, so they'll flap around as you try to carry it, and between this and at least one not-really 'optional' cooking surface, you have quite a bit of equipment to move around, when you take it with you. Realistically, this grill is part of a truck or SUV camping excursion, so really no big deal on the weight.I would not recommend cooking without the stabilizer. As inconvenient and shoddy as it is, having the whole thing tip over, lit, with whatever hot, greasy things on it doesn't sound like a good plan, either. You're just going to have to beat it on, chip the paint, etc. Of course, now you have one more accessory to carry, or to futz with taking off BEFORE you unfold the legs, then with putting on AFTERWARDS. This would be *extremely unstable* with a large pot of water (or two) on top, without the bar. Only a little dicey, with the bar.I have not lit it up. I've only unboxed, set it up and inspected it. But this detail is likely to remain my main complaint. They added this 'safety' wart, and didn't redesign anything else to work with it, and apparently DO NOT CARE how bad it sucks. Hopefully a 'DB-60E' will have this better integrated to allow the legs to fold while installed, or something. Realistically, people who buy this will 'forget' that stabilizer. It's a horrible, horrible design. Or I should say, COMPLETE LACK OF DESIGN.I think they added this stabilizer, not so much as a fix to prevent tipping, but as a fix to prevent tipping LIABILITY. ""Oh, you didn't have the hideously inconvenient, almost impossible to install, concrete scratching, poorly fitted kludge accessory installed? It's ALL YOUR FAULT your kid was burned alive!""It's not enough to make me want to return it. It's more than enough for me to not recommend it over the substantially less expensiveCamp Chef Explorer Series EX-60LW 2-Burner Modular Cooking System, Black, with the completely removable, wider stance legs that I should have bought.DAY 2I'm less annoyed by the stabilizer kludge. +1 Star. It is definitely more stable WITH, than WITHOUT.Got the steel griddle + grill attachments, today. They were loose in a huge box with some wadded butcher paper, bouncing around with some AAA rechargeable batteries that had almost got lost to UPS land. Not something to count against the grill, but I guess it's a lesson not to order 'itty bitty' things mixed with large things, when making an Amazon order.Had to chug a beer to have something to catch oil, as I decided to 'season' the pan a bit more before cooking. Maybe that put me in a better mood. The oil catching thing was obviously not... quite... designed for beer cans, unless you cut the top off. But most any kind of can should do. But an interesting tidbit. On the left side, the griddle drains DIRECTLY over the lock pin and its wire retainer, the one for keeping the leg deployed. They obviously put holes in the back for the same pins, but elected to keep both of the pins in the front. So for future reference, put the griddle on the right, or move the pins to the back. It looks like I can take the bolts out, and attach the pins in the back, where they will be out of the way, and near the CARRYING HANDLE, which I did hold to unfold the legs so I wouldn't scuff the paint. Good. Too bad they didn't think to BUILD IT THAT WAY, in the first place.I got some propane, and cooked some spicy chicken burgers from Trader Joe's, and toasted the buns with butter, all on the steel griddle. They were yummy, and did not last to the point of taking a picture. Have not used the grilling box attachment, yet.Minor annoyance about the griddle. It has a nice, convenient carrying handle. It doesn't stay put, and it gets really HOT. It dangles directly in front of the control knob for the flame under the griddle. You can still adjust the temperature... only very, very carefully. After the griddle cooled down again, I discovered that it can, indeed be stowed in such a way that it is completely out of the way. Just not after the griddle is already hot.A note on 'seasoning'. The griddle may be pre-seasoned, but that does not mean 'non-stick'. It only means a steel spatula will clean burnt/caramelized stuff off easily, leaving more burnt/caramelized stuff behind, to protect the metal. So I call that a 'complete success'.Day 3:Grilled the other two patties on the 'grill' box attachment. Had to wait an hour or so, as it emitted an awful greasy chemical odor, probably from the painted surfaces getting hot for the first time since they were painted. The cooking surface its self had the same kind of 'pre-season' coating as the griddle. Once the odor was gone, it cooked as expected, with nothing particularly noteworthy beyond that.Cleanup on the griddle + grill cooking surface was pretty easy. Both fit into my kitchen sink well enough to scrub a bit. Almost all the charred bits fell into the catcher under the grill, where it was easy to dump into the trash, knocking the bigger debris loose with a paper towel, once it had cooled off.DAY 8:Finally got theCamp Chef Patio Cover for 2 Burner Stoves w/Folding Legsat my door. It reeks of unspeakable, ghastly chemical horrors. Something like Cthulhu rising from a Rubbermaid toxic waste dump. Not a big deal, it's for outside, and just heating up the grill should drive away any lingering scent. Open it outside, keep it outside, and in a few days, it should lose the 'aroma'.As with the legs and pin location/drainage choice, there are some problems with the cover and the accessories. For one thing, the little 'side tables' can't fold at all with the steel griddle on the grill. So much for storing that ON the grill, under the cover. I found a place to hang it by its handle, so that's not really a big deal. With the BBQ grill box in place, the table on that side can fold up to 90 degrees, but I ended up just shutting them and setting the two halves of the grill on top, rotated 90 degrees.CONCLUSION:All in all, now that I've used it a few times, and have all the accessories that I ordered with it, I recommend the less expensiveCamp Chef Explorer Series EX-60LW 2-Burner Modular Cooking System, Black. And a cheap TV tray. The built-in 'tables' suck, and cleaning grease off of them will be a chore. The cheaper model stows and fits RIGHT in all of the various covers/bags that others have reviewed, and it's can't possibly be any more bother fitting and screwing on four legs, than wrestling with this thing to set it up or collapse it or try to 'store' it, or even just cover it. This one doesn't really work with even the cover, unless you have somewhere else to put all the accessories.It's a horrible bunch of kludges built on kludges, with no thought given to use at all. The fact that they sold it without the stabilizer kludge, and none of their own pictures feature it shows they didn't even think about basic SAFETY, when they initially came up with this thing. No thought, design or effort put into it at all, and you'll regret it every time you try to put this away, or set it up.And I'm taking a star back, for those 'tables', and all the problems I keep encountering. At any time except when you're cooking and need to put something small and lightweight on them, they're an absolute hinderance."

Besides having to keep it wound all the time, my husband stated that the band was very unforgiving and uncomfortable. This is the third Invicta watch that I have had, and two of them are now no longer worth what they were paid for. It is very unfortunate because, the Invicta watches actually look so nice, but unfortunately, they just don't stand the test of time! (Pun intended). However, we also purchased a Citizen Eco Drive watch on the same day, and these watches are PHENOMENAL. They look great, and stand up to daily wearing, without losing time."

186270,2,"There were no instructions. The picture of the assembled unit on the package (which was the best hint they gave for assembly) was significantly different from the online picture (on which I based the purchase decision) and neither of them was close to looking like the actual product.The provided parts apparently gave you several different ways to attach things, but none of those ways was a decent fit for any bike my family has, especially not for the one I bought this for. The primary flaw is the two pieces that connect the front of the rack to the frame under the seat are too short. Also they only provided enough screws for the simplest possible install. If you wanted to use ANY of the small optional parts you would need to obtain extra screws.The package contained 7 long screws and 1 short screw. Unfortunately, I didn't think things through well enough in advance. The minimum of 8 connection points for my bike had 4 that needed the long screws, 3 that would be much better with a short screw and one that could only work with the short screw. I put the short screw where it was just better, not required, then realized my mistake and swapped screws but the short screw stripped when trying to reuse it."

81533,1,"While my sister visited me from another state, she suffered a fall during the night. She was calling me and/or my daughter, who unfortunately didn't hear her right away. It was almost 30 minutes later that I awoke to hear her calling me.She was not hurt badly but just a few bruises. I was upset that neither of us had heard her calling.So my idea was to get a ""cow bell"" that she could keep with her and would certainly be loud enough to wake either of us should it become necessary.It's just to make her feel more comfortable while here on a visit. We thought it was a good idea. My sister is coming back in December when I will present her with her ""emergency calling bell."" I know she is going to, first, laugh hysterically, and then say, thanks for your concern. Hopefully we won't need to use it."
96238,0,"It's cheap, and it feels cheap.My first and greatest gripe is the way this thing marks the rounds -- ie, with a bell instead of a standard beep. I'm not huge on appearances, and I don't mind looking a little foolish if it means I get a little better, but I honestly feel like such n00bsauce with this dinging bell thing going off in the middle of an MMA gym full of Muay Thai, MMA , and Jiu-Jitsu fighters of a more serious persuasion. It makes me wish there were a silent vibrate function, and I definately don't feel like bringing this to Marine Corps groundfighting or martial arts training sessions because of how annoying the thing sounds.It doesn't tell you what round you're actually on, it just tells you how many rounds you originally set it to.I'll only be using this at home and shadowboxing in the mirror, and I'll just use my gym's timer for work at the gym, k thx."

Polar makes better monitors in my opinion."

She wanted quad skates in a girlie color, so this is it.I can't believe that these cost this much."
452081,0,"I needed to order these shorts for my daughter to fit requirements of a fitness program she was going through. They fit her a little shorter than pictured on the manaquin (why don't they use real people in these pictures?), and so they didn't meet the requirements.Material is just your basic, thin stuff. But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her. I'm glad they are now using a read model. They held up for a few months before they ripped. They served their purpose."

There were no directions in the box on how to blow up the ball portion and which direction to put the ball in to the plastic part that you step on. Needless to say...it is still in pieces in my garage and obviously not being used. I am sad about this because they really are fun to use, but make sure when you purchase one it comes assembled, or make sure there are directions in the box."

Once while using this one, I placed it along a well used trail. I actually had a 6 point walk the trail and stop at each wafer to sniff it. Walk around the tree or bush, sniff it again and move to the next one. HS is the bomb."

There are wrenches to fit several marginally different tiny sizes of spoke-nipples. There is NO way for the bicyclist to determine the right size of wrench to purchase, so a person is led to purchase SEVERAL DIFFERENT wrenches, or EVEN WORSE, slip-shod circular multiple-size wrenches of LOW QUALITY."

I reaaally push the machine. at this point, it def is anything but 'whisper quiet', and it's not just the squeaking other reviews point to. after a half hour, the resistance wheel starts to wheeze and feels 'off'. it has recently started leaking black fluid onto the tracks the wheels sit in. small amt of fluid, but still...I expected the 430 to hold up better than this. I am not a whiner, and I would say this machine could be great for you if you want a lighter/ easier going workout 2-3 times a wk. BUT....Use it everyday, and you'll start having issues I promise. I bought the extended warranty, so we'll see how that goes. Initially it seemed like a great machine, but now I'm going against the majority of the reviews by saying I wish I had spent more for a ""pro"" model that could withstand the daily abuse of an intense workout. I'd give it 3 stars max...depending how the warranty (repair) shakes out. so..Depending on how you use it, it could be a great machine, but for me....I wish it was holding up better. it should have made it 3-5 years in my opinion, and the whole 'whisper quiet' is simply a joke after the first few months-although that has little to do with my overall complaint of the machine not holding up well."

445645,0,"I used this rangefinder for one season of playing golf. It is well constructed and operates as claimed. The only drawback is that you have to be able to actually see the flag to be able to get a reading. The other problem I encountered was if there is something behind the flag like a tree this product has a hard time telling the difference between the two. I understand that they (Bushnell) have newer models that do not have this problem. I later purchaced a GPS unit that I like a whole lot more as it gives you much more information than just distance. This is a good product, but I think it is obsolete in light of all the amazing GPS units out there now, some which can even be applied to your smart phone."
474837,1,"This product works great, you'll need elbow grease and about 30 minutes of work to get the tough stuff out.

I highly recommend, due to it getting the job done in a cost effective manner."

It is cheaply made of a VERY thin metal that bends very easily. I would still recommend this product, given that the price is very good for a large poker set, however, be aware that you might choose to purchase a better quality case, as we will certainly be doing."
392124,0,"I got this product about a year ago, and for the most part have been quite impressed with it. I originally purchased it to keep track of HR during runs, and make sure I was keeping myself down around 60% and not over exerting myself, etc. It worked great for this. It did seem to go through battery on the main unit rather quickly, and when I replaced the battery myself, that only worked for about a month (but this could have been due to faulty battery or something.)My real gripe is that the calorie counts that it delivers seem very exaggerated. I am primarily interested in using the unit to help me figure out my expenditure during exercise now, and unfortunately it seems to be way off. Newer units ask for more information, but all this unit requires is weight and max heart rate. It has no idea if I'm a man or a woman, my height (and therefore my still rather arbitrary BMI) and the other host of information that help make a calorie estimate more accurate. I'll give an example: I commute to work in the morning on a bike, mostly down hill, with a couple steep uphills at the end. Usual elevation gain for the ride is 54ft (compared to 254 on the return trip) Strava regularly estimates my avg 20 min trip at 130-150 cal, runkeeper estimates 350. My heart rate monitor says 400 for the trip. When you compare that to an online calculator that uses avg HR and height/weight/age values, I get 278 compared to 400. Take that one step further and apply gross to net calorie conversion, and you end up with a total of 242. So If I was entering in 400 cals into my counter, I'd be overestimating my workout by 150 (assuming that the online calculations are in anyway more accurate, but they require more personal information) I find this a little dissapointing."
367946,0,"The AB Sonic Massage Belt works as advertised and is easy to use. The only draw back seems to be that it runs on thin nickle size watch type batteries. Two are provided. These batteries don't last too long and are fairly expensive to replace. So what you save in the purchase of the massage belt you spend on batteries. If you use the belt daily, which you have to do to achieve any result, you can go through quite a few batteries. If you don't mind the expense and inconvenience of constantly having to replace batteries the product is quite good."

I have to change my socks at least once a day, and I'm not super sweater. I have other boots, no sweat problems. But with these it's just a matter of time before my feet are freezing because I'm rotting in cold, wet socks.And, they. are. hard. I know you need to break boots in an all, but they're hard as heck. Tight. I'm talking tight on my instep. Feels like a vice-grip on the top of my foot. They're easing up, but I don't know if they'll ever be truly comfortable. And maybe I'm the wrong person to review these, because I don't ride, or muck out stalls, or whatever. I live in the city. But I wanted a pair of boots that were as comfy as the boots I wore in High School. Not so much.If you're a half-size, get the half size. Don't size down. I can barely get my hoof into these as it is.If I had the money to spend again, would I buy these boots? Probably not.But they're well put together. I'll probably have them two decades from now and may then, just maybe they'll be comfortable, before disintegrating entirely."
227339,0,"I never had to actually float with this on, but I used it on a fishing trip and found that while driving a small boat with an outboard motor and trolling at the same time, my arm had to rest against the mesh material and after a while it would get quite uncomfortable.

The rack snapped in half behind our motorhome, leaving us with $1,000 worth of destroyed bikes. Buyer beware!!!"

458668,0,"This knife was is a little bigger than I expected it to be. It's just under 7 inches with a 3 inch blade. Being flat on one side(see pic) and roughly made, it's the cheapest looking knife out of the six I bought from BUDK but for a price of $3 I shouldn't complain. This is knife gives some if you try to flex it. Basically it's a cheap Chinese made knife that you can treat like heck or just keep in a pack and not care if you loose it or bust it. It is not high quality steel. It's purpose is self defense. It is not a throwing knife. It clicks into the sheath decently. I wish the sheath had a belt/boot clip rather than a a cord. And FYI, BUDK is fast to respond and resolve any issues you have."

As soon as it got light we packed up and went to a hotel.If you're going to use it for cool nights, say to 50, it works quite nicely. If you're not a polar bear-type, try something with a lot of down."
348835,0,"The ball is nice. I've only been using it a couple days, as the pump that comes with it (which is one reason I bought this ball over others that didn't come with a pump) is a cheap little plastic thing that split once, and after I taped it, then broke apart completely. I had to rig up a bicycle pump. Long, tiring process. Buy this ball if you want, fine, but not because it come with a pump. That would be a disappointment."
482991,0,I like the look and feel and it certainly sharp. I haven't owned one of these type of knives before and maybe for that reason I can't for the life of me figure out how to close it once opened. There doesn't seam any automatic way to disengage it from the locking groove at the front of the knife and since it is so sharp and the handle small I am afraid to put a whole lot of pressure to force it back in to place. So on instinctive operation I give it the 3 stars
42140,0,"If it werent for the crazy mess i had to go through to get this thing replaced, i woulda given this four stars. The gun itself works just fine. a good 10 BBs a second, and fair accuracy. also looks great. however, the button that holds the cover on was broken when i got it, so i tried to get it replaced because the seller has a 7 day reurn policy and it was HELL finally getting them to accept it, even after i sent pics of the problem they said they couldnt help me. at least it worked out, but if ur gonna get this gun, pray to god, theres no problems with it."

381720,0,"I just received this pedometer a couple of days ago. Purchased it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. My initial observation is that it can both grossly over and under count the number of steps taken and I'm already thinking of returning it.I was on the elliptical machine today and yesterday and spent an hour on it w/the pedometer in my pocket on both days. Yesterday, it measured around 9k steps which was in line w/the time/distance measurements on the machine. Today, I was on the same elliptical machine for the same time/duration and it only measured about 4k steps (less than 1/2 the day before). Will try it again tomorrow to see what it comes up with.Also noticed that it will count almost any leg movement as a step. For example, if you sit at your desk and ""shake"" your leg up and down (like people do when nervous or bored), it will count each movement as a step. Guess you have to remember to take the pedometer out of your pocket whenever you're not actually walking in order to make sure it doesn't give false readings.Will see if I can learn how to get more accurate measurements out of it. If I can't, it's going to be sent back and I'll just have rely on my own ""common sense"" gauge of how many steps a day I'm walking. Giving it a 3 star (""neutral"") rating for now and will upgrade it if I can get more consistent measurements out of it or downgrade it, if I can't."
423595,2,"This dirt bike is ""designed for ages 12 and up,"" but when my eight year old got on he looked like he should be a clown in the circus. The bike is tiny. I would recommend it for 5 or 6 year-olds, but no older. We had two other Razor electric dirt bikes, MX650 and MX500, and either of those would be perfect for an eight year old. In fact, after being disappointed by the size of this bike, we went ahead and ordered another MX500 (which, by the way, is an excellent product)."
51864,0,"I sold off a lot of games and an old Xbox system to get this game and the new Xbox360. My neighbor who I have played probably 500 games on NCAA 2006 came over and I was embarrassed.Just some comments that he made:What is the deal with screen putting a red box around the play I am selecting? (I know you can bluff but that seems a little awkward)Where are the 1AA teams? (Are these in the game anywhere? Maybe I haven't found them yet.)Do I have anymore choices when creating a player?One positive comment:The graphics are crisper and the stadiums look nice.Anyway, $60 later and I wanted to play NCAA 06 but of course Xbox 360 doesn't offer a download so this game can be compatible with the 360. It is funny how they don't have mods for the newer games like Fight Night 2nd Round or some of the newer titles if a more expensive version exists specifically for the 360. I should have researched this a little more with regards to the backward capability. Maybe my impressions will change if I play a little more.One other thing is that the players twitch a lot. Twice last night a defender passed by my quarterback and my quarterback went flying as if he had gotten sacked by a truck. We watched the replay over and over and my friend commented that he must have kinetic ability where you can make a tackle by just getting close to the ball carrier. That is really nuts. And like a previous post it froze twice.I'll keep playing it and see if I can develop a better attitude towards it. Maybe I just played NCAA 2006 way too much and have a hard time adjusting to the new game. It seems that a lot of other reviewers are in the same boat I am."
408752,2,This is just an average product. Not a high standard one where you feel satisfied with your purchase I was hoping for better quality. The air escape and the pump is very cheaply made.
388136,2,"I bought size medium based on the sizing chart. Unfortunately, the STABILicers frequently fall off my size 8 men's winter boots. I don't immediately realize when they fall off, once I do, I have to backtrack on the trail looking for the STABILicer that has fallen off. One time, I didn't realize one of the STABILicers had fallen off and almost fell because I expected to have good traction on some ice. I bought black, red may be better for noticing that they have fallen off and finding them on the trail when they do fall off.I'm using these while walking my dog on local trails in the woods of eastern Massachusetts, nothing too rugged. They do provide good traction on ice, but simply don't stay on. Maybe these stay on better with a larger shoe.Feb 2011 UpdateI'm still using my STABILicers. However, I now have a very small bungee cord strapped across the top of the boot to keep the STABILicers from completely falling off. The STABILicers still occasionally pop off the toe of my boot, but now it is immediately obvious that they have come off and I can pull them right back over the boot.Just a note, the 32North website indicated that the Lite's are ""Ideal for walking, jogging, and light running or trail hiking"", so I am using them as intended for light trail hiking. I'm wearing these over a light hiking boot, so sizing shouldn't be an issue, just seems like they need more material to better wrap over the toe."

70442,0,"FALSE SPEC. The watch DOES NOT have screw-down crown, so the""Pro Diver"" designation is a bit of a joke. The advertisedscrew-down crown was one of the main reasons I wanted thewatch. I STRONGLY DOUBT IT'S WATER PROOF TO 200M. Also,the second hand is different from product photos.I ordered model 9204 but the back of watch is designated 9204A.Maybe there is a 9204 model with screw-down crown ??The Screw on stainless steel back, with O-ring gasket seemswell done. The bezel operates well with a nice consistent feelto it. Internal mechanism is small plastic Japanese, whichappears cheap and fragile, and looks small enough for a ladieswatch. Battery is small SR626SW.Very attractive watch, with well finished solid SS case andsolid SS link bracelet. Lume works very well, and stays clearlyvisable throughout the night. Accuracy is normal for a cheapquartz. It gains about 15 seconds per month, when off wrist,but gains about 8 seconds per month when worn constantly.Synchronizing minute and second hands is difficult becauseof backlash, but I've seen worse.Overall, it is a nice watch, and well worth the $53 price, ifit continues to be accurate and reliable. Because of advertisinginaccuracies, I can't give it full marks."

205690,2,I bought this for a trip from Upstate NY to Cape Cod MA and this rack collapled 2 times about 250 miles out. It is not built well. I had two bikes on it and it felt strong but It just was engineered poorly. Luckily I had a bike lock attached to the bikes and the spare tire and that saved the bikes and rack both times. I had this on a 2008 Jeep Wrangler. I would not recommend this. One good thing was Amazon returns are free and I got my money back very quickly.

393885,1,"Overrall it is a great rowing machine for the price. It counts your reps,calories, time, etc. which makes it great to track your progress. The machine was fairly easy to put together. The directions could be a bit more clear, but after looking at the picture and the parts you can figure out what needs to go where. Once I got past that it ended up taking about 20 minutes to get it all put together and I used it immediately after. I have only been using it for a few days, but love the workout as it gives you varying resistance, and works out alot of your body. The only downside I have to this is the foot pedals, which is exactly what every other review will tell you. I have tried it various ways and my feet slide out regardless. I drilled a hole in and put a block to help keep my feet in and everything is perfect now. If you don't want to mess with this machine because of that you are missing out. All of the other comparable rowers cost WAY more, and all you have to do is tweak the pedals to your fit. Pros far outway the cons in my boat."

42156,0,"It is as advertised. The unit itself is well built. The rubber pads that the bike sits on will easily slide back and forth on the bars. I'm thinking of hose clamps on the bar to act as stops. On my 1-1/4"" hitch the unit is just a little bit smaller and will pivot 5 to 10 degrees (parallel to the back of the car) even with the hitch pin inserted. Not a big deal as during normal driving (even at 70 mph)it doesn't rock back and forth unless you're going over bumps. The threaded hitch pin is milled at the end to accept a hitch lock, but doesn't come with one. you're on you own for the lock. I bought mine for $70 at wal-mart and thought it was an OK deal"

I dont think they claim it to be anti fog but until you get into the water on a sunny day you dont realize how important that is. I had to stop every few minutes to clear them up from the inside.2. When you go under water, the pipe does get filled up with water.3. The fins, were pinching on my toes on one leg after an hour of use."
322260,0,"First off i planed on getting the stock before i got the gun.So heres my 3 stars. This product states in the instructions that it is not made for the marlin 795! To that i say poop on u! So first off once i got the stock and layed it out. First thing i did is line the old stock up with the new one and realized that a large amount of plasitc needs to be cut out for the magwell and mag release. Then i need to plane off half of the plastick 1/2 inch behind the front action screw in the shape and thickness of the trigger guard. I had no dremil. I began to outline the shape with a sieries of small holes with my drill then cut and filed flat and uniform. Planeing off that small area was a nightmare,borrowed a friends dremil for that . A while after that the action/barrel fit in with no problem. Installing the top part of the handguard with a scope on wasa a pima so take it off before hand or wait to fit it. Lastly make sure your trigger is positioned properly so it will fire. You have one shot so trial and error is key i fit my trigger guard multipule times ,stock was tight. This review is only on the marlin 795 other models will install with much less effort. 2nd main problem was with my utg low pro bi-pod...... the stock has a extended swivel stud that provides a loose fit when mounting on utg's swivel stud adaptor. the nut provided will not clear the cross pin to tighten to the stock. i needed washers .. that will need to be milled to match the bolt with the cross bolt. on the factory stock the problem was in reverse with the swivel stud. good luck take your time"

91109,2,"I was really happy with my Coleman PerfectFow Insta Start Grill Stove for about 1.5 camping seasons.That all changed when I took the grill out a few weeks ago and needed to cook a bunch of hashbrowns. I brought out my griddle and placed the it on top of the grill and the burner and proceeded to cook the hashbrowns. About 10 minutes later, I finished cooking and took the griddle off of the stove and found that the grill had actually melted and bent down into a warped unusable (and probably toxic) piece of metal. I can only assume that the griddle reflected enough heat back down at the stove... in the process it also melted the insta-start button and warped the controls of the stove. Unfortunately, Amazon's return policy has expired, so gonna see what Coleman will do about it.In conclusion, it seems that this stove is only meant for cooking open air, without any pots/pans on top of the grill... so unless you NEED a grill for burners/steaks - would recommend getting a two burner stove as they provide a little more flexibility."
362370,0,"I LOVED the design online and it looks just as sleek in your hands! However, the measurements are messed up. I ordered a medium based on my head measurement as instructed by the Size section. The medium was large enough to swivel on my head. Had to return it, heart broken and too lazy to order a small to try out and find it would not fit either.Here's my advice for helmet shoppers based on experience: Take the time to visit Target or your nearest bike store. Try as many helmets as you can (trust me, no 2 helmets, even the same size, are the same!). You'll find the one you want and then look it up on Amazon.com for price match. Then you can order online or buy in store."

469994,0,"May, 2009 - Okay . . . this is the second update to my review. Just days after the two-year warranty period ended, the computer console completely died. It's a useless piece of machinery now. I contacted Schwinn and they basically said, sorry, you're out of luck. I'm not a happy camper. I had such high hopes for this machine. I'm now thinking this machine is a solid 1-star item. Too bad, but I think I know why this model is now discontinued.November 2008 - This is an update to my earlier review. I would now give this machine 1.5 or 2 stars instead of 3.We've had this elliptical trainer now for about 18 months. I've been hesitant to write a negative review, thinking that perhaps I had received a bad one. Now, looking back at some of the other reviews, I can see a definite pattern.When this machine is working properly, it is a truly great workout! I like the program options and the workout customizations you can create. The heart-rate feature has been a little frustrating. If you don't use the chest-strap (supplied) you have to use the heart-rate monitor on the hand grips. Not a big problem, but it takes the machine a long time to recognize your heart's proper rate. (i.e. it takes well over 1 minute to work its way from 70 to 80 to 85 to 90 . . . to 160 or higher.) This affects the calculation of the calories you've burned, etc. and meanwhile, you're not getting the extra exercise benefit of using the motion arms.Unfortunately, that has been the least of our problems. The bolts which keep the arms fastened to the foot pedals are in constant need of tightening. I've put everything I have into making sure the nut doesn't get loose (and I'm not a small man) and still they loosen and we get a lovely clank, clank, clank, clanking sound to accompany the workout. (A lot like the Chinese water torture!) There are several other squeaks and creaks but I'm not sure where those are coming from yet.That would also be okay, but this past weekend the main mast (the center pole) broke! The piece is welded into the base with about five or six tack welds, which just isn't enough!! I ended up dissembling the entire thing (over 45 minutes) and taking the two pieces to an auto-repair place to have it re-welded. The guy said he was surprised that they used such small welds to hold the weight of that big, steel pole.I paid a lot of money for this unit because I was going for quality. I didn't want all of these problems. I even did my Consumer Reports research. It was all for naught. Hopefully their later models have addressed these and the many other concerns that I've read about, but as is, I would avoid buying this one. Schwinn used to be a good name, but the current owners of the brand are not doing it justice with this model!Best of luck to you!AGS"
305911,0,"Pretty nice cleaning kit. I use it to clean my Sig P220. Comes with pretty much everything you need. My only issue is with the case. The plastic seems a little flimsy and I usually handle it cautiously to prevent an accidental breakage. But, other than that, it gets the job done with no problems at all. I'd recommend it to a friend."
467618,2,I was very dissapointed with these arrows since they looked nothing like the picture or description. Not even the same brand. plain black with blue and white fletching.

313649,0,"These are very comfortable gi pants. They are a good heavy weight, but soft cotton, not the heavy canvas type, flexible and easy to move in. I've had several different gi pants, and these are, by far my favorite. They are elastic waistband, rather than drawstring, but I prefer that. And as a female martial artist it can be difficult finding gi pants that fit well, but these are definitely the best I've worn.Update to this review: I had decided to purchase another pair of gi pants and ordered these again since I liked them so much the first time. Unfortunately, the gi pants that arrived this time were nothing like the first. The previous pants were brushed cotton, elastic waist. The pants I received the second time were the heavy canvas type material, drawstring waist, and had the ProForce label on the front, exactly what I did not want. I'm guessing the description is intentionally confusing because the pants come from different vendors and Tiger Claw has no idea what may really be shipping? At least I was able to return them without difficulty and was able to find another pair of gi pants elsewhere that fit perfectly. Just be aware when ordering the gi pants may be different than what you expect."
449,2,"At 80"" iong, this is an extra long twin, not a standard twin. Consequently I had to take back the sheets I bought, as they were 5"" too short. I would have ordered a different model had I known that 80"" wasn't standard. It's easier just to replace the sheets and I don't have time to send the bed back."
79409,1,"These shorts are very comfortable. I prefer to wear them without underwear, but the fabric can be slightly see-thru. When wearing the lighter colors your private parts may be visible."
32443,1,"I have had these Harbinger 155 Power gloves for nearly 2 years and they have served me well. I do weight training about 3x per week and the seam on the left palm just started to come apart. And that was probably due to me throwing them in the wash. I am loooking for a new pair right now, but I am only really writing this review because I was very surprised about the 1-2 star comments of people not liking these gloves.Not often that you see a review like this one...after nearly TWO years of frequent use of a product. I highly recommend these gloves!"
57701,1,This is a great workout. All 3 dvds are a good workout. I used this to lose the baby weight after I had my son.

384604,0,"This product was great the first month I owned it, but with continued use I saw that without even my trying to go in one direction, it would move on it's own. Much like how gravity has a tendency to pull your limbs and body in one direction...it felt like I all of a sudden was a lot heavier on my left side. Well, I can't say I really got much of an effective workout after I discovered I was working harder to not spin in a one directional circle, pretty much counter-productive. I guess I got what I paid for. Although since I had ordered two, I've modified my workout to incorporate the both which actually does work. I don't spin. Not a complete waste of money."
376150,0,"After assembling, then reassembling the unit, it still comes out crooked, and will not lean naturally against a wall. Also, the rubber rings used to keep the ""arms"" from sliding down broke after a day or two.You can get the rack to work even with the above problems, but IMO those problems should not exist."
348977,2,horrible at holding knots. very thick daimeter i order 25 and its thicker than my stren 40lb test. i would never buy this again. all my knots would slip and i would lose my tackle no matter how many knots i put in it.
389419,1,"This style clip is great as it has easy on and off for the flag. However, I forgot to measure the mast they were to go on and found they are too large. :o(I recommend the clips, but I also recommend making sure of the size you need before ordering. :o)"
159838,0,"The picture displayed is of the old (discontinued) Yeoman configuration with the combo balde (screwdriver/can opener/bottle opener/wirestripper). The knife that arrived had 2 blades, one can opener/small screwdriver, and one large screwdriver/bottle opener/wire stripper.It may seem like a small thing but the new configuration has one more back spring and is therefore 1/8"" thicker."
328290,1,"I bought this product for my 6 year old daughter who loves to tumble. We have loved the mat, it is very firm and folds up nicely. Since buying the mat I have learned that some mats available are not compliant to CPSIA 2008 law and are not Phthalate free. Does anyone know if these mats are phthalate free?"
480987,1,"Since using the PowerBreathe I have more easily withstood the strain of intense breathing during strength training. Whether or not this has improved my performance directly, it has made it easier to mentally focus and make deeper inroads during a long set--which, in turn, has certainly improved my performance.The PowerBreathe is inexpensive, unlikely to hurt anyone (as far as I know), and actually kind of fun to use. I wouldn't consider it sure to produce miracles, but I found it an excellent investment."
488055,1,"We bought this many years ago - probably when it first came out sometime in the 90's. I used it quite often, but when we semi-retired and moved to a smaller home, we gave it to my daughter because we thought we had no room for it.Four years later, my daughter asked if we wanted it back. She likes using it, but had converted her ""gym"" room to a family room and needed the space. We took it, thinking that we might offer it to our community gym here.But when we saw it, we were reminded of how little space it really takes up and decided we'd try it in our home office. It's small enough not to interfere, and I love getting up from the computer to jump on for a quick two or three minutes regularly. That's just the kind of break I need from being desk bound.The nice part is that this can be easy or hard. You can relax and go slow and easy or pull hard. You can vary whether your legs or arms are doing the most work. You can add more weight or take it all off.The calorie/speed indicator stopped working years ago, but I really don't care about that."
461098,1,"The ball is very durable and I love that the rubber is not too thin or slick. The ball does deflate a little after each use, but that is to be expected. Great quality!"
126227,0,"I love this watch. In fact, I would go as far to call it perfect...except for one huge thing...the titanium case is about as durable as wet toilet paper.I've had this watch for about 4 weeks and the titatium face looks like I've had it about 15 years...and no, this is not from any kind of extraordinary circumstances. I just wear it to work at a normal job every day and it sees the regular wear and tear that any watch would see. Yet the titatium face shows scratches, gouges, abrasions, etc. Unfortunately, it dropped off my bathroom sink the other day and fell to our tile floor...well now it's sporting a nice gouge where it should be beveled.As for the watch itself, I love it. It does have rather short battery life, but with all that's running inside this thing, that can be expected.So if you don't care how beat-up your watch looks, then I'd give this a 5/5 for you. But if scratches and abrasions on your new $250 watch will bug you, then I give it a 2/5."
193593,0,"First off, I am a bit conflicted in giving this product 3 stars because it is a product that I still use and generally enjoy, and I got it for only $5 bucks (it's a bit more expensive now, but not much).But there are a few reasons I feel this knife falls short for most potential consumers. One of the biggest - the standards of Forschner's excellent and popular 8-inch chef's knife are not met in this product.I've owned a forschner chef's knife for a while now. Like most, I was impressed with the quality and bargain. So I had fairly high hopes for the paring knife. But when this knife arrived, I noticed a few things.1) It was quite thin and flexible, bordering on flimsy. No big deal, for a paring knife. I wasn't planning on using it to cut through bone anyway and being thin is useful for a lot of things. In fact, I've come to think this is a major strength of this knife - a thin knife cuts with less resistance and there's no reason for most people to want a thick heavy-duty paring knife that I can think of.2) It wasn't polished to a mirror shine like the chef's knife. Again, though some claim a glossier knife sticks less to food, I don't really find there to be much of a functional difference, especially for a knife of this size.3) The handle is nylon and not fibrox. I'd have known this of course if I'd read the description better. Still, I sort of liked the feel of the fibrox on the chef's knife and wish that forschner had some paring knives with the feature. (Maybe they even do, I don't know. BTW I have no idea what fibrox actually is except that it's some sort of plastic.)4) The handle is very small, even on the ""large handle"" version. This small handle is useful for fine detail work, but can get lost in my hands (normal adult size) when trying to do faster paring knife work - peeling, coring, cutting citrus wedges, making tournees of vegetables, etc.5) Most importantly, I noticed immediately that the paring knife was not nearly as sharp as the chef's knife. The chef's knife was sharp enough to easily shave hairs and shred paper to ribbons upon arrival. This paring knife on the other hand tore paper as much as cut it and couldn't shave hair at all. No real defects - just not carefully sharpened at the factory. It was, in short, about as sharp as any new but crappy knife. I wondered if it was even made of the same high-quality x50CR MO steel as the chef's knife. I looked online and though I couldn't find any info specific to this model, i did find an assurance that all victorinox forschner knives use the same steel.So I took out my whetstones. And I'm happy to say that the little knife sharpened up beautifully. The metal ground away quickly, but the steel was still very willing to take a good razor sharp edge for me - i didn't have any of the problems I often have with cheap soft-steel knives. I believe I will probably use this knife and be quite happy with it. But here is the problem. If you don't do your own sharpening on stones, I can't really recommend this knife much above other cheap paring knives. Those electric or roller sharpeners will not do the trick. And most people won't bother to pay a professional to sharpen a $5 knife. But you'll never get cutting performance comparable to the forschner chef's knife without a good sharpening.The edge retention is comparable to the chef's knife, meaning that it's strictly OK. Expect a few months of home use before it starts to feel dull. There are better options for edge retention, but they also cost more - sometimes much more.I guess it could have been just the knife that I personally received. But again, there did not appear to be any defects. It simply lacked the polish and craftsmanship of the much nicer chef's knife. So while this knife is actually a nice bargain for those with whetstones due to the quality of the steel, it was still a bit disappointing to those expecting the same quality as forschner's chefs knife."

246907,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."

These run a little bit small and should have just a bit more length to them. I'm 6'3"" tall and normally an extra large works fine for me, but not in this vest. I would have ordered an extra large Tall, but they don't come in the Tall size.I really like the fleece feel and the two outside zipper pocket, but it would be nice if they had an inside pocket, like Columbia puts on the inside of their Cougar Peaks outerwear."

375510,2,"(the following also applies to the trail hawk)I pray for the safety of yourself and those around you if you plan on using this for any actual work. The head is attached to the shaft by means of a tiny, tiny, TINY screw (which on my particular model, had been screwed into the shaft so far that it no longer even grabbed the axe head), which is a horrible solution to an easy problem. Thus, this axe can't be thrown (as the impact severely damages the shaft, mine split because of the screw), used in medium duty camping situations (buy a proper camp axe, you'll be glad you did)(it's also too heavy to pack), etc.The shaft arrived unfinished, and very splintery.Buy this (buy the trail hawk, it's much lighter) only if you want to make your costume a bit more realistic, or to hang on the wall, and nothing more."
24160,0,"I bought this rack based on the good reviews here on Amazon.The rack arrived very quickly. It is well designed, sufficiently strong tubing and joints, straps and buckles. It is simple to attach to the rear door of our Toyota Highlander without needing the instructions (which are at best a distraction, anyway... see below).The box was sufficient to protect the contents, but there was no internal packing, not even a plastic bag; had the box been subject to rough handling or rain, I am certain the rack would have arrived damaged. Luckily mine arrived in perfect condition.It is a bit of a misnomer to describe this as a ""four-bike rack""; it is a good size for carrying three bikes. Two adults' mountain bikes, one youth's bike and one child's bike is a *very* tight fit; with the handlebars turned 90 degrees and the pedals removed to take up as little space as possible, the last bike sits just at the upturned end of the horizontal bars. Four bikes is possible, but if you have pannier racks or other accessories that add to the width, you'll probably need to remove them.You should replace the plastic wing nuts supplied with steel nuts and apply thread-locking compound, and use bungees or extra straps to anchor the bikes to the rack.The instruction leaflet included in the box is laughable. I suspect it has been included as a legal requirement; it is no use whatsoever.The list of compatible cars is printed in tiny pale type; barely readable. But what is the point of including this? Surely you do the compatibility research *before* buying the rack?The instructions are out of sequence, and have you jump forward a few pages for an SUV, then back again to the beginning. The illustrations are not helpful.Lastly, the translations into Spanish, German and French are among the worst I have ever seen. Whoever typed them could not even get the spaces in between words in the right places when copying the text to do the page layout. Abysmal."
483291,1,"I got this for my 13-year-old daughter because she had an old Baby-G and she just loved it. That one got old and THIS one got her attention. She wears it everyday and when I tell her to not wear it, she just keeps it on! Amazing! It's at a great price and nothing can go wrong with it. Even the old one we got I believe 4-5 years ago, is still working fine! Great product and I will recommend Baby-G watches for young women and your daughters."

289787,2,"I really wish i had not taken the advice from the reviews to order a size up. The jacket is very pretty, i ordered a small in green envy and the color and quality of detail is really nice. It is really noisy however, and the fact that it engulfs me makes that worse. I would normally have ordered an extra small, and that would have been better. The frustration comes because the jacket is quite roomy everywhere but the shoulders , which means to return for an extra small would be prioritizing aesthetic alone, since mobility and therefore functionality would be impaired.I make my decisions to purchase items online carefully reading all available reviews and product details thoroughly.I am 5'2, 110 lbs.

335232,1,"I bought this item at first used to get a discount but it has to be new in order to receive the Dvd. I'm a mother of a 3 year old and a 1 1/2 year old so I feel pretty tired and sluggish on most days. I started to do Tracy's 30 day method along with the eating (which is definitely harder for me to do than the exercising) and instantly started to feel better. The first couple of days were the roughest for me getting used to the eating and working out pretty hard. But after that I don't remember a time when I've felt better. Before I had kids I would run for up to 5 miles a day and I would think to myself when are you to supposed to start feeling good. People always would say that working out makes you feel good but I don't remember that feeling. And after having two babies one right after the other my body and eating habits were really bad. I already notice my clothes fitting better and I definitely feel energized and just happier and I'm only on the 7th day. But I definitely recommend this book, you just have to have strong will power to make yourself continue to work out and eat the food she has laid out. The food is the most challenging part for me."

I like that you can create your own resistance and can work both your arms and legs at once and with low impact, and it is a pretty natural feeling motion, unlike some ellipticals.

The music isn't bad, but I listen to my own (it motivates me more).The resistence band just broke on me today while doing the alternating shoulder presses, so i will be buying a new one at Academy today.I lost 8 pounds after completing my first 30 day challenge, and have more energy through the day.Short workouts set out for you are pretty ideal when you don't have too much time in your day to work out.It doesn't track your weight, but I use my fit for that, but I love knowing how many calories I burned.It gives you goals, and I create my own, more motivation.In the journal you can track your eating habits, which make me guilty, so I try to eat healthier (my weakness is soda)."

470144,0,"Let me start with the positive: this bike gives you a very good workout. The dual-action provides an almost total body workout -- building both cardiovascular endurance and strength. The motion is smooth and not stressful on the joints. As the exercise intensity increases, so does the resistance provided by the fan wheel; and, as a side benefit, the wheel also provides a fair amount of cooling. The LED is large and easy to read in variable light conditions; and, it provides a wide range of metrics to gauge your workout performance.Now, to the bad: to put it succinctly, Schwinn's quality ain't what it used to be. In the little over a year that I've had my bike, I've encountered more than a few issues; and, although I wouldn't classify any as major, they've all been very irritating and frustrating. The list is as follows (I apologize in advance for any inaccuracy in the name or description of parts):- Shortly after I got the bike, a ring that keeps the pedal assembly from moving relative to the frame came off -- causing the assembly to move side-to-side while riding. I returned the bike to Amazon for a replacement.- One of the arms was missing a washer in the part that screws it to the frame; and, as a result, while I rode the bike, the arm would be progressively unscrewed from the frame. I returned the arm to Schwinn for a replacement.- A wedge pin attaching one of the pedals to the assembly broke -- causing the pedal to fall off. Schwinn sent me a replacement pin.- On my current bike, similar to my first one, the ring keeping the pedal assembly stationary relative to the frame has also come off -- again, causing the assembly to shift left to right as you ride. Since I've had the bike too long to exchange it, resolving the issue this time is going to be more painful than it was the last.In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that I do put the bike through a fairly strenuous workout. But, I knew that in advance -- which was the reason why I decided to buy a Schwinn: hoping that I'd be getting a high quality bike. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out like I'd planned."

Some of the reviews say this one isn't as tacky as the black striped one. However, I disagree. This is made from the same tacky material as all of the new synthetic balls are made from. That being said, the lacing is NOT tacky, which is fine. Tacky lacing is for fake football players. Kid's gotta learn how to throw from as natural a lacing as possible."

275240,0,"I've got a pretty large frame cruiser, but still within standard bike sizes, and the bar is just barely long enough to connect between the handlebar stem and the seat. If you try to pick the bar up in the middle (with the bike on it) the beam comes apart. It seems to be ok on the actual rack though, as there are two contact points towards the sides. I always keep a SUPER close eye on it though because I'm waay nervous that it's gonna separate and my bike will go tumbling down the road. I haven't used it very much because of it. If you've got a smaller frame bike you probably wouldn't have a problem at all."

208545,1,"I purchased this bike from Amazon after reading the other reviews which mentioned the value the bike represented at the $325 selling price (25"" frame). I am a prime member so the bike arrived in 2 days. I promptly handed it over to my neighbor who is much handier that I am. He had the bike assembled in approximately an hour. The bike gears were stuck in high gear for some reason so the next day I took it to a bike shop to have the gears adjusted. They also installed some thicker tire strips as I read the tires are prone to going flat due to the spokes. A few customers who came in inquired about the bike because it is really nice looking. This bike is super light and has very responsive steering. On even slight hills, I easily get up to about 20 mph. You really have to be ready to brake because it really flys. Overall, I would highly recommend this bike to anyone looking for a strong, lightweight, and sporty bike."

No hinges on the case - the only thing holding the lid to the back of the case is the glue (which is my case had come loose) attaching a small strip of leatherette. The lid fell off when I opened the case. I was so disappointed because I was really looking forward to getting a new game. Also - the dragons use the Chinese characters for dragons, not a picture, so could be confusing to new players (like my group).I gave this a 3-star overall because of the shoddy case."
416334,0,"I bought this because I can't stand squatting. The bags will slip off after a little weight so, probably best to poke a hole in the bag so it slowly drains (and doesn't splash on your feet). I really would have liked it if it had a lid on it since the bugs like to get up in that thing with a quickness. It's not fun sitting on a bag of bugs! Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do and is sturdy enough to hold me at 180 pounds."
89521,0,"I got this for a present. Not sure I would have purchased it for myself. I don't use the swing speed stuff that much. Never could figure out how to make the best use of it. I know already when I swing too fast! I do use the scoring function often. It does provide some useful info but the PC based part of the process leaves a bunch to be desired. It does not do a good job of presenting information in the way you would find valuable. You have to did around to get at what you want. The transfer mechanism is also a bit erratic. The worst problem is that it eats batteries. I play about 3 times a week and I don't get much more than 6 weeks out of a battery. Considering the written material says 6 months, something is not all it should be.In summary, a good idea with a lot of very rough edges."
107427,0,"This suit works absolutely GREAT! You really sweat up a storm! The ""BUT"" is that it does rip easily for no reason!

I am going to order 3 more (1 for me and 2 for friends) and I think I'm going to carefully duct tape all the seams (top and bottom) first before wearing."

268412,0,"Forza is a great cool down workout. I use it to warm up or cool down from other workouts. You do feel a bit in the shoulders but otherwise it is more of a relaxing workout. I know alot of people dig the yoga stuff so if you do but want something a bit more in motion; this is most likely a fit.I would also recommend to LARP kids and people who are wanting to get started in working out but are worried about early failure do to intensity. The reason is, it doesn't get the heart rate up too high but does work the body and would make a great spring board exercise routine. For LARP players, its a workout that involves sword swinging muscles and works them repeatedly so you are less likely to grow tired while beating on your best friend.Now for the down side, the DVD menu is like a bad bootleg as was already mentioned. Thats about all that needs to be said there.Second, if you already know a martial arts: DON'T BOTHER. Nothing in this will sharpen an already developed style. Coming from a Tai Chi sword background, I find it difficult to perform her unexplained stance and grip. If you don't know anything about sword fighting, don't worry about this. If you do, she goes very little into stance and nothing into hold of the weapon. This is fine because she is doing an aerobic routine and not teaching sword techniques. I just find myself wondering if my hips and bellybutton are in the right place when it is not part of what she is trying to teach. All my flaw, not hers. I expect others to have the same problem.Lastly, the workout is not hard. If you are a workout nut and want to up your ability.... not it. If you want something different but with the same level of intensity... not it. If you want a cool down or an off day workout - GET IT! It's a long slow workout and has its place, just not as a replacement to your current workout."

287700,1,"I like underarmour products, this one is the most popular and it really helps to keep you warm in cold weather. It's pretty good but don't think it is going to keep you warm on a windy day at 32 degrees. Since it's made for sports, as long as you are moving or running, you should be fine. The only thing I don't like is the price. It is kindda expensive but I guess it is worth it."
380157,0,"Okay where do I start. I was a little daunted when I read reviews on the Poker Case arriving damaged or dilapidated. Even with Super Saver Shipping, the product arrived in 4 days, (Including non buisness days). I opened the case and it was amazing. The case was unsullied, there was no damage to it whatsoever. The case was so great looking, it looked like it was packed to the top with $100 bills. The cards and chips were quite exceptional for the price. Chips were 11.5 grams and felt like real clay.I was so impressed with this set of chips. It was the exemplar of poker sets, the model to be imitated by other companies. It was too good to be true...Oh Wait! It is. One day after i recieved this item, i picked it up and the handle snaped off.I might submit it for a replacement, but I am going to attempt to repair it first.Great product, bad handleHappy Shopping, Amazon for best prices."

25427,1,This is a nice floor mat. I wanted something thick to put on the floor for exercising to make it easier for my neck and back as well as for getting up on my knees prior to getting up from the floor. It also works great as a mattress for the Grandkids when they come for a sleepover. I used it on top of my Granddaughter's twin bed and it was quite comfortable. I have dogs and cats so the material covering this mat could get pretty hairy so I bought an inexpensive zippered twin size mattress cover and I can still fold the mat for storage (just can't use the handles for carrying). I think I need to buy another one so all my Grandkids will have a place to sleep once the twins grow out of their cribs! This is a better investment than buying twin size beds that will take up space.

For someone who does not use this regulary, I did not realize that I needed to purchase precleaning fluid.

When I calculated the math on Insanity turns out I was only burning about 300 calories per workout. I did further research, maybe it's just me....Nope, most everyone I found on the internet that calculated were burning 300-400 calories on every single session, even the longest ones. Was I working hard enough? Let's put it this way I was monitoring my heart rate and had to stop because I was in my danger heart rate zone. The most calories I found someone burned was a longer session and their top number was 454. Then I thought well this is interval training so you burn calories all day long after Insanity workouts. Ohh, oh...you burn about an addition 50-70 calories a day due to interval training. I'd rather have that slice of cheese and run and burn double the amount of calories you do by sweating your balls off with Insanity. It's a good sweat but 300-400 just isn't enough for me but to each his own!"

When I put this Hogue grip on the pistol there was an unsightly gap showing between the frame and the grip. I don't like this and I was going to return the grip until I found the return shipping cost made it worth more for me to just keep it. I'll order a Pachmyr grip after I research more. I also got a Hogue grip for my s&w j-frame pistol and was very happy with it. This was an older gun and had a true square butt."

But again, the pad had spots on it, and there was no manual or anything that came with it, which I find odd. Even your simple toaster comes with directions or warranty of some sort. If I had purchased this at a local store, it would definitely be returned. Unfortunately, I don't want to have to pay for shipping to get a new one when the bench itself was about $30.

109525,1,I have owned this device since June 2006. The device linclines from 0-12 degrees and provides speeds of up to 12 mph. This tread mill gets up to speed and stop quickly but should not trip up most people. There is no cool-down cycle like on the systems at the club. Also the pluse sensors in the hand grips take a while and some adjustment to get an accurate reading. I plan on ordering the chest band monitor from the manufacture in hopes that will provide better feedback during my exercise routine.-G

440293,0,"If you don't know better, these probably seem like an improvement over the cheapest karate scrubs available, but compared to quality middle-weights, these really do seem like cheap lightweights. I wanted to replace some quality middle-weights that use a drawstring with something equivalent with this type of waist band. In that regard, this type of waistband is much more comfortable than a drawstring alone. Another plus is that they have a back pocket. Their saving grace is that they only cost about $20.On the downside, as I alluded to, compared to real, quality middle-weights, these are thin, light and abrasive, being partially synthetic. They're more of a middle-ground between real middle weights and light weights. Additionally, unlike a lot of other quality pants, they lack any fastener for the pocket. So don't put anything in it if you're training (not that you should anyway).It's a ""for the money, they're decent"" thing."

257019,0,I was hoping this would work to train my son (6 years old) to ride without training wheels which it did- worked great. It worked so well we only needed it for one day. I had then planned to put it on my 3 year old's bike to help push her up hills since she is not a strong peddler but you cannot use this product with training wheels. Other similar products on the market attach to the seat so could be used to aid/push young riders then help transition older riders from training wheels. All-in-all good product but hard to justify one day of use.
347159,2,"Do NOT trust the rubber straps to hold your bike on! I had 2 bikes both on the front of the rack as I was supposed to. I strapped them in very tight and put the blue cable around them for extra security. Plus, I had a bike lock wrapped around both of the frames. I wasn't on the highway for 10 minutes when one of the bikes popped off. Luckily it was strapped tightly to both the rack and the other bike so it dragged behind my car until I could get off the highway. I'm in the process of making a warranty claim to Thule so they can fix the damages to my bike. So far their claim rep has been nice but doesn't seem to think that they're going to pay for anything. My only shot is that there is a small fray in one of the rubber straps.Overall, I actually really like the rack. The lesson that I learned is that I need to use lots of extra straps to make sure the bikes can't move AT ALL. Also, I wouldn't recommend using this rack with a car, even if you have a hitch. The weight of the bikes pushes the shocks down so the bikes bounce around a lot more."

Helps to not be startled. All of the above deserve four or five stars. However, the fact that the radio doesn't have any presets nor does it provide any indication of where you are on the radio dial qualify for one star. A major annoyance and that deserves one star.

120636,1,"I really like Zippo's, and I have been trying to make the transition from cheap disposable Bic's to a more permanent lighter. In addition to my new Black Crackle Zippo I also have a Black Ice Zipper style Zippo, but I really don't like to use it because it looks so nice! I don't want to scratch it or wear the logo off, so it ends up sitting in it's case in my drawer. Really nice looking lighter, but not useful as a daily tool. So I needed a solution, something that I didn't have to worry about scratching or having to constantly wipe finger prints off of.As the title signifies, ""Rhino Liner for your Zippo"" is what I expected when I bought this lighter. For the most part, that is the case, but in other ways it is not. Yes it does have a gritty texture to it, but it is not rough feeling in the least, in fact it is smoother (or more slick) than a chrome style Zippo. With my Black Ice Zippo when I hold it in my hand I feel as if I have a good grip on it, if I get my thumb and start from the bottom of the lighter and slide it to the top, the case feels as if it has some grip to it (as long as my hands aren't greasy or something). With the Black crackle if I slide my thumb from the bottom to the top, it slides very easily and has virtually no grip on the lighter whatsoever. If you have anything in your house that is painted with a matte black style paint (that has a rough texture), that is basically what this lighter feels like. And it has significantly less grip than a chrome style Zippo.Now the look of the lighter is great. It's all black with that rough looking texture, simple yet beautiful. I may actually like the look of the Black Crackle more than I do my shiny Black Ice Zippo. And this thing is 100% fingerprint proof and likely very scratch resistant. It would have been perfect if it had a small white Zippo logo on the case.Now for the biggest downside of the lighter, the hinge quality. I have had this lighter for just about 2 days now, and I like to frequently flip it open and close it (who doesn't like to play with their Zippo?) Everything was great when I first opened it, the hinges were solid, smooth and nothing was loose. However in just two short days the lid is now extremely loose. If I hold the Zippo by the bottom and shake it, the lid is so loose that I can hear it moving back and fourth while in the closed position (makes an annoying clicking sound as it touches the insert). And when I open it, the lid pivots back and fourth much more than it should. Technically the lid shouldn't pivot at all if these were constructed right, but the new (well, since 2005) 5 barrel Zippo hinges really stink, even my Black Ice one moves a bit but it is not nearly as bad as the Black Crackle hinge.Overall I am pretty disappointed, I really like the way the finish looks since it is practically scratch proof and definitely fingerprint proof, but it is far too slick and slippery feeling for my taste, and the abysmal hinge quality is appalling. I guess I could send it back to Zippo, but I would be paying almost as much in shipping as it cost to buy the lighter. And it's likely the problems will just return (like the loose hinge) since the new Zippo hinges are no good at all. They really should go back to 4 barrel or even better, 3 barrel.UPDATE 7/16/2011 - I have decided to bump up the rating to 4 stars, as two was a bit harsh. While the hinge may be a tad looser than my other Zippo's and it may not have the grip I would have liked, it is a decent tool that gets the job done. This Zippo is the perfect lighter to take if you don't want to worry about getting scratches or fingerprints, and you really don't need to be delicate with it as the finish seems pretty tough. The perfect Zippo to chuck in your pocket or toss around to your friends without having to constantly worry about the finish getting messed up. Although I have the feeling that while it may be impervious to fingerprints and scratches, the finish may 'chip off' in chunks if dropped or hit hard enough."

32565,0,"The compartment is very roomy and can hold tubes, levers, CO2 tanks, etc. However, the velcro strap around the seatpost has caused me some problems.I ride on a Specialize Toupe saddle, which is very narrow and has minimal padding. This allows my thigh to run inward toward the seatpost a little more than a more generous saddle would. There has been a tremendous amount of rubbing on the velcro strap. Because the strap has relatively sharp edges, it actually caused a hole in my very expensive Descente shorts on a recent century ride.If you ride a padded, wider saddle, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you ride a narrow, thin saddle, you might want to look elsewhere for your saddle bag. Most likely you'll need something with a strap that attaches closer to the underside of the saddle or without a strap at all."
113709,1,"How to review a sweatshirt...I like Adidas fleece sweatshirts like this. They've got good colors, don't fade much if you wash them properly, and they're stylish.

472786,0,"I'm pleasantly surprised to find how versatile and effective they are, but they're flimsy for ""Very Heavy"" exercise equipment. The problem seems to be the grommets (holes the band passes through) on the handle. I pulled one blue band straight through it, while the purple one first bent, broke then popped through over 3 exercises, leaving a nasty welt both times. While I'm on a serious exercise program (P90X) and have done weight training sporadically over the last couple years, I'm honestly a bit of a pudgy nerd, so I don't think I'm too powerful for them. To push it on some exercises (overhead lifts, whole body movements), you've gotta stretch them pretty far, and the line between slacking off and breaking the band is too thin for my taste. If you're doing strength training and plan to be doing high-resistance movements, I would recommend a different band with a more reinforced attachment point. This probably isn't an issue with the lighter bands, but they really should build the heavy ones better."

198112,0,"This turned out to be more flimsy than we had hoped. Gets some use, but not too often. Main straps are WAY too long, too! We had to cut them in order not to drag or double wrap."
169036,0,"You have no idea how much I wish this actually worked for me. When it worked it was outstanding! But it just never worked. I contacted support and they responded but only to say that they insists in works in testing on their Treo 700w. I would do restarts before launching, shutdown everything else running on the phone but I could rarely get past a few holes without the software locking up or just shutting down randomly. Very, very frustrating. But when it worked it was very impressive! I no longer use the software."

117472,0,"I bought 6 sets of these for an upcoming fundraising event. The chips are great...no problem there. However, the cases are a whole different issue. First of all, they are too large for the number of chips. There is about a 2 inch gap between the end of the case and the row of chips. Thus, when you pick it up, the chips shift throughout the case. Secondly, the handle is made of cheap plastic and one of them broke before I even pulled it out of the box. There is no way you can carry the weight of these chips in the case by the handle. I am interested to see what customer service will do."
396578,0,"I orderd this vest and the one I recieved was not the same color. The one I recieved by BRIGHT royal blue with silver reflective marks on it. When ordering this in such a large size, one does not neccessarily want a BRIGHT color. This was why I had choosen this one. I will most likely be sending it back. It was a gift for my father who works for fish and game and is required to wear a life jacket."
96800,0,"I am a professional truck driver. My wife bought this cooler for a Father's day gift. At first I was impressed, but after awhile I found a few issues.The cons:1. It does not fit in the spot where my cooler/fridge goes in my semi truck(2008 Freightliner Columbia), the handle sticks out.2. It only cools the food to about 30 degrees below room temp.3. If unplugged for even a short amount of time it gets warm(needs better insulation)4. The reversible plug continually came unplugged, I never used the heating feature so this sucked.5. Shelf placement within the cooler while upright did not allow a jug of milk to fit underneath.6. Drained my truck battery, even after just a couple hrs with the truck off. This happened in two separate trucks I drove.The pros:1. lightweight.2. Greater amount of room for food, while horizontal.3. Might be great for short excursions.I was given a Coleman cooler, that I have been using for about two months. It keeps the food colder.Both coolers have possitives. You have to decide what you need more. Greater amount of room, or a cooler that is simpler to use.For me, next time I buy a new cooler, it will be another Coleman."

208848,1,"I bought a natuzi sectional sofa and when it arrived had a peice that was damaged, so they replaced it. The peice they replaced had a slight dull color which you can tell only if you are looking at certain angle. I tried few leather cleaner with no success. Finally I came across this product and I purchased both cleaner and restorer. When I used this product not only it was easy to use but it did give me a very good results. Now you can hardly see the diference in color. It cleans and restores the leather to make it look soft, bright and natural.Money well spent. It also works on car interior, leather seats etc."
284476,0,"The 956 Rack that was sent had not been properly machined so the parts would not line up to receive one of the bolts. The rack was effectively a really large paperweight! After looking a little closer, the part that goes into the car's receiver was also screwed up a little but functional.Thule customer service was really polite and told me that I could ship it back and then they would send me a replacement. This probably would have worked if our family was not 700 miles from home on vacation...sigh.Stuff happens, I guess. Off to find a hardware store and fudge the job. I'll machine it when we get home.Other than a little quality control issue and some poor timing... the rack is okay and not a bad buy for the money."

356697,0,"These aren't the most comfortable bands I've ever used, even with the handle they can really bite into the flesh especially for the larger lasses, and if you have the misfortune of it slipping up and putting pressure directly on your shin... I had initially planned on returning them, and I am concerned about the juncture where the band connects into the circle as it feels like it will break after a while, but they're functional with a little imagination."
446934,1,"I'm a person who is very picky on what type of watch I buy, and more so when I can't hold the piece before I buy it. I own expensive watches and lesser priced watches, so for me it comes down to the look, feel, and quality in determining if I'm going to spend the money. I was looking to replace a real nice titanium Citizen watch I bought in Europe 15 years ago. That watch finally stopped working (too much use probably) and Citizen doesn't carry the parts for it anymore, so I've been looking for a watch with similar looks, appeal, heft, and features. After many months and many different brands, I am pleasantly surprised to have found a quality watch made by Nautica. It has a nice large face with the chronograph features and the stainless steel band with the ridge detail adds a nice accent. If you are looking for a lightweight watch that is discrete, this isn't it. This watch has a strong look and feel without being gaudy. It is definitely worth the money."
271412,0,"The shirt is well made, with even stitching and nice seams. The cotten is not as heavy a weight as I was expecting."
153614,1,"excellent, product and does what it should. Except is pictured with a black waist band and the one's I received have white waist band on black. Looks a bit silly. But they still work well. I ware it under my uniform, which is black, and luckily, the waist band never shows. If that is going to be a problems then you might have to look else ware for merchandise."
97403,1,"The watch has gone on over 100 deep water dives (down to 120'). Due to the saltwater use, I find that I have to replace the rubber watchband every year or two (bands can be found at Wallmart, Target, etc.). I change my own batteries. The watch tool to open the rear costs $10 and is well worth it. I lightly lube the rubber seal with oil before replacing the back. The watch is still watertight. Mine is now a bit banged up as I never take it off (used while repairing cars, surfing, household chores, etc.) It still keeps great time, but I'm considering purchasing a new one as my crystal has a few scratches and I'm afraid that Casio my discontinue this model after all these years.I keep the analog watch set to EST and the digital to GMT (as I have friends in the UK)."
312406,1,"I've had the 9938 for just over two years and find it very accurate and beautiful. It took about a month to break it in, then it has consistently ran about 2 secs/day slow. I've learned that if left face up overnight and worn all day, it will run for well over a month without gaining or loosing as much as 5 secs. Mine does not have the 25 jewel ETA-2824 Swiss movement that originally came in these watches. Instead, mine has the 26 jewel Selita SW200 Swiss movement, commonly called an ETA clone. Comparing the movement in this watch to those in other automatic Swiss watches in my collection, this movement is among the most consistently accurate of the lot.The 23K gold plating really sparkles beautifully along with the highly polished steel parts and the sapphire crystal. I often notice people sneaking an inspection, presumeabley to see whether it's a Rolex. People often do the same when I wear my steel and gold Rolex sub, whose timeless design Invicta has nicely copied. The blue dial is strikingly beautiful too, particularly in the sunlight.The only item I don't like about this watch is that numbers on the bezel are in a more copperish dull gold color than the rest of the gold. Also, the blue part of the bezel is quite easy to scratch. I'd prefer screws rather than the existing pins in the bracelet for securing the extra links, but they work fine once they're in place.I will recommend this watch to anyone who wants an accurate high quality divers watch."
367772,0,"I bought this ride-on for my 2 year old. It took 20 minutes to put together. I thought the instructions were very clear. It had several options for infants through preschoolers. I chose the push-trike since my toddler can't steer. The sound effects were unexpectedly cute IMO but the trike is very loud on the pavement. The scratchy plastic wheels totally drown out the motor & horn sound-effects. The push bar is an ok height for me at 5'10"". The handle is just *really* floppy to use when trying to steer though! To turn you need to push down on the plastic ""roof"" arch, but it's way too flexible to control without extreme effort. I've only pushed my toddler around the block twice in the past 2 months. I much prefer our Kett push-trike. Fortunately our 6 year old likes to race around the driveway in the Bounce 'N Go so it wasn't a complete waste of money. It would probably be fun for an infant to use too, since it can be used as a bouncer w/o pedals."
406209,1,"these fit well, are very comfy and are a great addition to the llounging attire my hubby has accumukated. The gathered ankle are soft and not too tight and they launder very well."
139011,0,"As other reviewers have stated, this grill is good for burgers, dogs, and steaks when you're tailgating. I did grill some egg plant and it was ok as well. My problem is that I love to cook chicken thighs when I'm camping, and it doesn't work well for that. I don't marinate them or put bbq sauce on them until I'm done cooking and it doesn't make a difference except it's easier to clean. It doesn't matter if you bring it up to temperature before you throw them on, and don't move them for awhile. It still sticks. Cleanup is a nightmare because it's a one piece grate that's pretty large. What I've found works better than this for camping (gas grills aren't real grilling anyway) is a Lodge reversible cast iron griddle. It has a griddle on one side and a grill on the other. It's cast iron and comes pre-seasoned. It's a ton easier to clean and I actually use this Coleman grill to heat it up. I'm even thinking of tossing the grill grate from this unit to lose the additional travel weight. If I were a big hot dog and hamburger eater, this unit would get 5 stars. I'm more apt to cook a turkey burger, which would stick to this grill like pine sap on a hairy arm."

254143,0,"No complaints about the quality, but they turned out to be too big for me (I wear size 6.5 shoes)."
226021,0,"These balls are not in the shape that they're described. They are dis-colored and have scuffs on the majority of them. The balls seem to be deaden or have been hit to death at one point. Basically better off going to WalMart and grabbing the sack of balls for 11 bucks rather than getting basically the same quality for 30....First time buying these recycled balls and probably won't be doing it again. Even though the NXT is a better quality ball and this is a good price/ball, they seem to have all the life taken out of them so your better off just buying brand new Top Flite's."
451969,2,"when i received these bottoms, I didnt expect much because polypro is plastic basically. I dont blame the seller for the quality. These pants do not flex with your movement and they were a bit snug on the legs. The one great thing about these is they make a great wind block. I bought these mainly for warmth but they are not flexible enough to move with your body. they kept puklling on my knees. They also make me sweat but its no different than wearing a plastic trash bag. The vender sent them very quickly and I was pleased at the quick response. i just did not like the quality and flexibility. I wish they made a really warm pair of these undergarments that was really warm and breathed."
12094,1,Like the columbia fleece product they are soft. I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax. I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality.
64089,0,Because I am someone that is bigger I was of the opinion that that 3xl would fit that way that I like ........ although the fit is ok I just thought that it would have a little more room in the shorts being a 3x...... otherwise good shorts
448472,0,"Having already owned a Schwinn, I decided to get the women's version for my daughter, and men's version for my son. I am not at all satisfied with quality of the derailleurs. Photos on the site indicate Shimano Equiped, unfortunately I have Sram. That may not be a big difference, but it does concern me that I did not get what I thought I purchased.I'm am satisfied with the frame, wheels and tires, but for $230, I would expect something better than a $150 bike at wallyworld."

253651,1,"Gave it only 4 stars since didn't get a chance yet to test it out in rainy weather. Nevertheless, it's very spacious, seems well constructed, great value for the money compared to the more expensive brands out there, where you'd pay more than double the price!"
463605,0,Very light and easy to frame mount. Valve adaptor setup was confusing as instructions are quite limited. Takes a lot of pumping to fill a 700 tire and difficult to get up to pressure.
72916,0,The quality of the shirt is good however it does run small for the sizes.
196522,1,I am very happy with my new life vest. It is comfortable and well made and it fits me perfect. Nice zipper and buckles in the front. And the two zipper pockets in the front open and close easily and are roomy. Very nice life vest for the price.
467653,0,"I waited with major anticipation for these gloves to show up. I got the XXL size since one reviewer had said they ran smallish. Okay, they arrived. Took them out, put them on. Loved the overall feel and comfort and cosmetic appeal (its important for all wearing apparel to look good, yes? Smile, yes.) I bought them to replace my very worn Nike's. But, and I really hate to say this, here's the thing. The stitching down between the fingers is incomplete. Between most all the fingers. At first I thought maybe they were made that way, or maybe I just hoped so. But I don't think they are. The failure to fully stitch the leather between the fingers is bothersome, but for my purposes wasn't enough for me to go to the trouble to send them back. I probably should, and most would, and in all honesty, I thought Mizuno had higher quality control standards. Other than that.....smile, yeah, other than that, they are quite nice."
3483,0,I had to get these for a wedding. Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8.
274221,2,"As many others have said, the steering bar doesn't work properly and the bike is WAY too tippy - two things you do not want in a tricycle. We gave ours away after our older daughter outgrew (and never used) ours and are shopping for a different one for our younger girl. Stay away."
254770,1,Nice quality and great choice of colors and sizes. Can't beat the price for the variety and quality. A+ all the way.
211408,2,"I was so disappointed to receive a book and not a DVD. I browsed through the book hoping that it might still be savaged, but to no avail. It is better used as a textbook about Zumba than to actually do the workout. Very frustrating. It was terribly misrepresented."
297066,0,"this product was alright, especially given the price. the only issue i had with it was the handle. the ""two handed"" handle was awkward, and could not be used with both hands wielding the blade with any comfort. it has a handle that matches the contours of one's grip creating a fixed grip that doesn't yield to the way one holds a two handed blade"
296211,0,"Number 1, make sure that your weight bench is the right size for these. the inner section of the bar is only 31"", and a lot of racks are too big for that.Number 2, these weights will probably never work with any other bar you get, so don't consider it a foundation of set.However, that said its a decent set for the price, everything went together quickly when I got it, and all my components were there. The box had not survived and FedEx covered it with packaging tape to hold it together, but otherwise its good.Eventually you'll move on to something else, but until then this is a decent set for the price. But don't be like me and buy a nice weight bench expecting to use this with it."
210752,0,"A friend and I ordered the Flex bands and pilates workout to start exercising in the evenings. The bands were exactly what we needed and had the extra length, some that we looked at were much too short. We have only had them a couple of weeks, so the (body) results aren't in yet. Ha."
243407,2,"These guys make such a bewildering array of products that when you find one that meets your needs, you can never find more of the same kind. They should number their socks or something - &#34;Style Number 314683&#34; or the like, if they even make the same kind of sock, with the same texture and material and weight, for more than two months in a row. It's a pain, because if I don't wear wool socks my feet hurt, and they used to be very reliable."
113545,0,"Standard mid range quality belt, very light, and runs small, I would recommend going one size larger, could serve in a back up roll."
130434,1,This was a gift for my boss who was always telling people they were late according to his watch. So this watch I gave him is as accurate as possible using the radio signal to set time. Many fewer people are late now and even better his watch and mine are set by the same radio signal. Always right on time.
344076,0,"I play college level lacrosse and as I'm in college, I have no money. I bought this seeing a great deal and a good opportunity to practice. The product description was lacking, but i figured that from the picture it looked sturdy enough. They neglect to show (in the picture) that the net is connected to the frame with velcro bands that are, indeed, not sturdy at all. The first shot I took on it (around 75 mph) three of the bands snapped in two. I have since reconnected the net with twine instead of the velcro and it works well, but the initial product should specify that the quality is made for small children (not even high-school level) whose shot speed is not quite so high. 75 mph isn't even that fast..."

496269,1,"So far, this product functions and works great, but only time will tell whether it will hold up or not."
305693,0,I bought this product looking for a wider coverage than traditional but it is extremely big. I donated to my building because it looks good. It's not for an average individual.
401252,0,"These will do the job, but will leave you wishing you spent a little more on a better set of wraps. These are not really long enough to do a proper wrap and the material is pretty cheap. It will get the job done, but it could be much better."
387077,0,"I was disappointed that after my first use they started to rust, and then rolling them was impossible. After using them I would recommend trying to clean them with alcohol and storing them in a jar of oil or something. Stainless steel balls would be worth the extra money."

371750,1,"After receiving one of these unexpectedly as a gift, I started carrying it on duty regularly. I've never had to use it, but understanding what it's for, how it's carried and knowing that it might be the piece of equipment that saves my life someday, I carry it gladly and with a nice feeling of security. Lightweight, well made, very comfortable/ergonomic."

30358,1,"I'd recommend this for anyone looking for a fanny pack that is good for more active events. There's more fashionable bags out there, but this one is perfect for everyday use or something else where you'd use it casually. I bought this for shows and music festivals so I can keep my phone, wallet, and keys in there and still dance and run around without losing all my stuff. Also i was able to remove the jansport patch and put my own Beatles patch on there. So I really love it now."
483537,0,"According to Casio, this model does NOT have a mineral (hardened glass) crystal or lens."
255612,0,"Although the product came very quickly and in great condition, it did not function like thought it would. Maybe I need to keep working on how to place it, but it does not stay put on my yoga mat very well. It moves around when my feet move and every time i am in downward facing dog I find myself kicking it back into place from where it has run up on the mat and wrinkled. It mostly serves the purpose of having a layer between me and my mat."
378363,1,"So, it's no secret I'm a Yankee fan and have been for as long as I can remember. There was a stint where I nearly gave up on them and rooted for the Dodgers, but that had more to do with their Brooklyn heritage than anything else. I've had pinstripes since I was a kid, but never the road jersey, so when the price dropped to about half of what it normally goes for, I bit the bullet and picked one up.The Yankees road jersey is most certainly my favorite of the two they wear. It's simple and grey with the navy ""NEW YORK"" in all caps across the chest. There's a reason they haven't really changed the style since the 1920s: it still looks good. Since I've had to relocate from the five boroughs, I've found myself wearing this over the pinstripes most game days. That and sometimes the pinstripes are a bit too ostentatious for random ""out in public"" use. It works well as a good second layer during the chillier days of fall ball.I'm usually of the opinion that sports attire is overpriced, but if you can grab it in a deal, I'd recommend it."
339803,0,"the pedometer was very intuitive and works very well and is the most accurate that i have owned. the clip; however, is another story. the pinching part is weak and to small, lost it the first dayout. i bought a second one for my wife, and drilled a hole in the clip so the lanyard could be thread through the clip and the meter, and attached the other end to the clothing."
346760,1,Paddles fast and catches waves better than nine foot boards I've ridden. After years of use my leash broke and the board washed up onto a rock break wall. It got pounded for several minutes before I could free it from the volvo sized boulders it had eventually become wedged between. There were dozens of tiny dents all over it and a foot long torque mark on the deck from the waves trying to break it in half... but it survived. I got a new leash and I still ride it as my primary board.
157061,0,"We have not had a chance to ride these bikes, yet, but I was very aggravated when taking them out of the box for final assembly. I ordered & received 2 at the same time. They stayed in their boxes until Christmas Eve, when I assembled them around 2am. Both bikes have numerous scratches, deep nicks & 1 spot of extreme & deep scrapes (2 inches by 1 inch, & at the exact same spot on each bike). Many of these are down to bare metal. It appears that the factory assembly & packaging process does not handle the bikes delicately. They will have to supply me with 2 types of paint for me to keep these bikes - 1 for the 1st coat of glossy paint, 1 for the matte finish on top of the glossy coat.Also, the decals on each bike were put on sloppily, each with many bubbles including some 1 to 2 inches long, making it impossible to simply press the bubbles out.The bikes feel & look solid. We will be testing them over the next week. However, I expect the manufacturer to make good on supplies needed to repair all of the nicks & scrapes, for appearance & to prevent immediate rusting.Final note: I also bought a girl's Mongoose at the same time (Mongoose Montana Women's Mountain Bike). It has similar but fewer issues. However, the bottom metal part of the handlebars that goes into the frame & expands to hold the handlebars in place is rusty & nicked up badly, looking used.3 bikes ordered from Mongoose at the same time, all 3 with substantial enough cosmetic damages to want to return all 3 if the manufacturer does not step up to make things right. I have 10, 12 & 17 year old children who are excited & disappointed at the same time."

160133,2,"I wanted to love these skates. They are white and pink, with eyelet lacing and exactly as I remembered from my childhood. But I can't skate in them. I don't know if I just got a bad pair, but they are horrible. The wheels have no give in them (I even had them loosened as much as possible at the skating rink) so turns are a challenge and there is no smooth movement and they run large, so they bunch up at my ankle in a very uncomfortable way. I prefer renting rink skates to these."
120919,0,"A nice HR monitor, but a 32 page manual? Really? I'm sorry, but that's just stupid. For basic info (avg. HR, zones, etc.), it's quite good. Showing HR as a percent of max is really nice, especially when you're aiming for certain targets in, say, hard interval workouts. Calorie levels are, as always, completely bogus, and you have to wonder why the manufacturers continue to foist this sort of nonsense on their consumers.Biggest complaint - it's just way too much of a pain in the ass trying to remember the button sequences, and they're just making the monitor do way too much simply because they can. It's too easy to get trapped in endless loops, and too easy to inadvertantly dump your data. And why do they insist on making the batteries so damned hard to replace?Easiest solution of course is to simply ignore the useless functions and go with what you need. For me, that's current HR, zone indicators, avg. HR for the workout, and time. If there was a simpler model (like there used to be....), I'd have gone for it. Also, after about a year, it started getting hinky - not showing HR, blinking out unexpectedly, or showing an HR that meant my heart had actually exploded into a million pieces (my wife's does the same things). I think that Polar is the best maker, but all in all, I wouldn't buy another RS 100, and I would kill for my old school Polar that was way WAY simpler and way more reliable."
178842,1,"I have used this on my road bikes, door hinges, pad locks, gliding rocking chairs, garage doors, fishing reels, door knobs, and many other household areas and it's the best product I've ever used.

85180,1,"This glove is not only a good looking glove but durable. My only complaint is that the closure around the wrist is an inch and a half longer than cycling gloves typically are. The extra length covering the wrist is fairly comfortable but very hot, soaking the gloves in sweat in all but the coldest rides. I wear full finger gloves year round for the added protection and sweaty hand have not been an issue in the past. Buy this stylish glove, wear it in the winter and keep it in the closet when it is warm."

304867,2,"Pros: The watch is attractive and is comfortable. Both of these are qualitative descriptions so take them with a grain of salt. The four circular numerical rings, the four faces and six hands gives the watch a busy but yet nicely detailed look. I find the smallest numbers a bit of a challenge but at 54 years of age I can read them without glasses or contacts.Yes, it is heavy, but men's dress watches often are and should be in my opinion. For those with issues perhaps your wife/girlfriend can find you something lighter or let you use hers. Come now get a gym membership. What an embarrassing complaint.The locking design of the crown is most welcome. I won't wear a watch with a stopwatch feature and no locking crown and have stopped wearing other watches because of repeatedly finding the stopwatch running.I have had the watch for years now and am an active person. The watch has seen many hours of outdoor activities including advanced home repair.Note although the watch is advertised as one for an active lifestyle take care it not very durable.Cons: Following up on the previous statement I have had to send the watch in for repair at least two and I believe three times. The issues have been the stopwatch hand refusing to reset to 12:00 and the last time for the second hand falling off. I have recently found the reset button not working but don't plan to return the watch a fourth time since I don't use the stopwatch and because I have other nice(r) watches. None of my other watches including the Seikos have had these or really any issues.Although a Seiko fan I can not recommend this model due to the issues I have had and continue to have. Nor would I buy another Seiko chronograph. I gave it a two star rating because these problems should not be occurring however the repair facility has been great about quick turnaround on repairs and would receive five stars if they could."

I'm not a big person, female, haven't worked out regularly, not a lot of strength, but when I punch and kick this I have to chase it all over the basement. The base is heavy enough so it won't topple over (I filled mine with water as instructed) but overall it is not heavy and sturdy enough to stay in place. So when I work out with it, it is also very loud as it wobbles all over the cement floor. Probably not suitable for anyone much larger than me (135 lbs.)"
266211,1,I have this baby attached to my dash with velcro and have found it to be a great help in the city and in the country. I also use it hiking in the mountains. It's pretty handy for that as long as you keep the antenna high enough. I ended up sewing velcro to the shoulder strap of my backpack and mouted it with the antenna pointing up. Battery life is amazing and the accuracy is pretty good in the car. I usually get a good fix on 6 satellites from my car and that gives me position to about 60 feet--more than enough to tell what road you're on.
445412,2,I bought two of these umbrella's and they both are broken with very light use. The interior ribs on one umbrella bent so that it doesn't close and the other had a rib that became un-rivetted. For 30 [...]they should last more than 2 months! What a waste of money.

472743,0,"First of all, this wasn't exactly what I had envinsioned. I thought it was an actual scope that mounts onto the arbors, but it isn't a real scope. The front lens is frosted, and looking from the rear you simply see the reticle projected as a distant image. You have to mount this in front of the sights or a scope, and you line the sights up with this image. This works great if you have a scope (or sights) that are between 1"" to 2.25"" away from the bore centerline. If you have iron sights that are close to the bore of the barrel (as most are) then it will not work. If you have raised sights like an AR15, it won't work.The included arbors work great if you have something between a 22 and a 45 caliber. The so-called .17 arbor isn't really an arbor, it is a spring loaded metal rod that does not center well - not a big deal unless you want to use this with a bb gun which I guess most people won't.Other than that, it is a great product and very simple to use. If this does not meet your needs, then a centerline laser is an option."

209362,0,"I bought this mat because it was a lot less expensive than many of the Thermarest options out there and I needed something quick. Like others have said, it does not inflate very well on it's own and takes a good few breaths to get it to inflate to a comfortable thickness. The attached pillow is a very nice feature and is separately adjustable from the main mat to fit your preference.The sleeping area itself is my only complaint. Wegner should have put in more rivet points or use another method to keep the pad more flat and even. When sleeping on this mat, most of the air goes to the area where there is the least weight: the feet. It took some adjusting to get my feet from flying into the air when I laid down or rolled over, but it is possible to find a reasonably comfortable position on this mat. The attached pack straps are handy to keep the mat closed too.Overall, I would say this mat is decent for the low price and having an attached pillow is nice. It might be a bit bulky for those that like to backpack, but is good for the car camper."

66358,0,"The wave worked well for the first year, occasionally it was useful to have a heart rate monitor without a chest strap and when it worked it did quite well.It is very basic- stopwatch and heart rate, nice to have a backlight.After the first battery change it started malfunctioning periodically, it would not give readings, buttons stopped working intermittently. Finally it just stopped working entirely during a workout.I find myself repeating- like Polar, it's not a casio, it's not a timex. The quality control is not great. It is not very durable.

87757,2,"I've owned a number of air guns and enjoy shooting them immensely, I'd always wanted a revolver style one but this one's price pretty much sums up what it's worth unfortunately.Operating it is difficult, including reloading, getting the C02 in properly is quite a chore and I ended up with more than a few bleeding cuts on my hand, not user friendly at all.The construction is unfortunately cheap as well, the trigger is sharp plastic and many of the other parts provide a very unrealistic weight to the gun which just isn't fun. After it punctured two C02 canisters that I had, I decided it wasn't worth keeping, I couldn't get it to operate properly."
230366,1,"This is a beautiful, functional HRM that is a perfect companion to your workouts. I previously had a cheap Sports Instruments ECG3 HRM, and although it got me my heart rate and calories burned (the latter is inaccurate), that was about the only thing it could do and I often had disconnects between the ECG3 watch and chest strap (interference I think). This Suunto, on the other hand is perfect in reception, plus it keeps a nice 15-day log of your workouts so you can really analyze how well you are training over time. I too was curious about the Training Effect (TE) that was advertised, but I think it does give a fairly good indicator of how hard you are working out. TE takes not only heart rate into account, but I believe also the time spent in the workout along with your age/weight and activity level (which it automatically increments with more activity). I was a little surprised that I got to a TE level of 5 (the max) on my first couple hour-long bike rides, but I guess it's in the right ballpark, as I was really pushing hard and needed recovery days afterwards. As you've probably already read, this HRM also has traditional zones, avg/peak HR, and calories. Speaking of zones, if you notice on the face of the watch, heart rate and TE are displayed on the circumference of the dial .. this is a very intuitive user interface for these numbers because you can visually see which zone you are in and your TE (a picture's worth a thousand words....).Construction of the watch is fine .. I was worried about the plastic face at the beginning, but so far it is doing well, and I only wear this while working out on a bike or an elliptical and not as my daily watch (I require mineral glass for my daily watch). Unless I crash and eat the pavement hard, I think it should be fine. Now, you'll notice that there are 3 different bands for the T3. Get this one in the review (the matte black rubber)! It's soft, very comfortable to wear (compared to the stiff band on the the ECG3), and maintenence free. The other shiny black plastic band requires trimming (!), while the fabric band will stay wet...I have also researched Polar models (a friend of mine has a high-end version for biking), but not only are they much more expensive, the batteries are not user-replaceable in the strap, and they don't have the graphical indicators around the dial that I mentioned above .. they are very numerically oriented.As such, I highly recommend this T3 model if you are active and want to improve your stamina. I am very satisfied and happy with this purchase.Btw, I also have a Nike Oregon Series Alti watch, which I used to wear while climbing to gauge the altitude, but that was the only piece of information I needed from that watch (and it's a bit chunky for my wrist)... now with this T3, I can pace up the hills without killing myself :)"

There is no Sports Illustrated Covers, but they were honestly pointless to begin with. I feel like some special teams plays are missing from the playbook as well as on the kickoffs. Finally, this is going to sound dumb, but you'll know it when you see it and it will bother you too is that on the Automatic Game Changing Instant Replays it uses two screens to show a long pass instead of the fluid ball in the air footage we are used to seeing. You can watch those manually yourself, so it's perplexing why that is. Finally, then pennants are gone, replaced by achievement points.The good news?Everything else is here. Dynasty, In Depth Recruiting (regardless of the reviews on IGN the recruiting is actually deeper then it has ever been with during season recruiting), Coach Contracts. It sounds bad but the Recruiting, great graphics, and user controlled receivers almost make up for it.Is it perfect? Not even closeIs it as good as NCAA 2006? Nope (except for the recruiting)But like so many have pointed out you can either pay $5 a month ($60) to play college football on your 360 for the next year or you out of luck. My NCAA 2005 (the best so far in my opinion) and all the other original xbox NCAA's have yet to be backwards compatible. No doubt a marketing scheme. But this is definitely enjoyable.

259267,0,"First of all, I will not say anything about the instructions. Basically, the instructions for all cheap airsoft guns are terrible. Now, the gun itself is mostly plastic, and there are several points where it is almost expected to break. These points are where the stock connects with the gun, and where the fore end meets the main body.For accuracy, the gun was pretty good. Although the shots were not very high powered, they could consistently hit something at about 50 feet. However, the shots appeared to be shot at the end of an arc, so there was considerable drop as distance went on. This made the shots easy to dodge at long range.Durability wise, the gun is kindof a joke. Way to much weight is put in the front (the battery is located in the grip.) The thin plastic supporting the grip to the body is pretty weak. On the 3rd day, my brother banged it against a CARDBOARD box and the whole front end snapped off.It's difficult to glue back on because the batter wires go through the area.Also, the magazine is overly complex. Rather than giving us several dependable standard capacity mags, we get a single hi-cap mag. Basically every 10-15 shots, you have to pull a lever, shake the gun, and hit another button. Definetely not good when your in a fire fight. It would be much easier and quicker just to change the magazine. Unfortunately, I'm not sure where to get good magazines that work with the gun.........sigh."

299942,0,"I'd read reviews on this product before selecting it from among similar products. My notes are as follows:ASSEMBLY NOTES:1) Most indicated that assembly was difficult because of poor instructions. Provided you're reasonably competant and careful, it's not that bad. I only had to go back and re-do one step because I'd used the wrong bolt in the wrong spot. There was only one major snag (see below) but this may have been just a fluke. All in all, I was done in a couple of hours, including interruptions from the kids.2) This is difficult to explain, but the cables used to move the leg braces were too tightly wound into the ratchet to hook on according to the directions. I ended up having to disassemble the ratchet entirely to unwind them far enough to hook on. That was a real pain and certainly not covered by the instructions. However, I was still done in less than two hours. It just took a bit of swearing and the courage to stray from the instructions a bit.3) Again, difficult to explain if you don't have the thing sitting in front of you, but ... there are two oval-shaped braces that come up off of the leg pieces. They keep your legs from sliding off to the front. those oval pieces can be removed and inserted into any of three positions along the leg piece depending on how long your legs are. On mine, the cushion overlaps one of the holes (the one I need, naturally) and the oval piece won't slide in right. Not a big deal. I'm sure I can get it in there, but I haven't fooled with it yet.USAGE NOTES:1) Now that it's set up, I find that I really wish the thing had a mechanical way to get your legs back together. The ratchet works great for pulling your legs apart, but once they're there you have to get them back together on your own. With your legs splayed out like that, you can't really exert any inward pressure. You end up having to push your knees together with your hands. Not perfect, but it works.2) The leg pieces aren't quite wide enough in my opinion. If you imagine those leg pieces like tables, you put your legs on them and as you stretch your legs will tend to move forward on them. At the extremes, even though those oval pieces keep your upper leg from moving much, your heels will tend to come off the ends of the leg pieces. A better design would be to have those leg pieces wider at the far ends with more padding towards the front.OVERALL ASSESSMENT:This was the least expensive option and it does what I want. I didn't pay for bells and whistles and don't mind that I didn't get any. I've never owned one before, so I have no basis to compare with other machines of this type. Given that it does exactly as advertized, no more, no less, I give it three stars."
285721,0,"The photo for this item shows two sierra cups, which made me think that I would be getting two cups. That will teach me! You only get one cup for $11.95. Aside from feeling ripped-off, the cup is a nice, big sierra cup."
192495,1,"I got each of my kids one of these bags because they were carrying big soccer backpacks to practices and didn't need to. This bag is similiar in weight and fabric to an insulated lunch bag. It zips almost completely open, like a clamshell, allowing easy access to the ball. Outside it has two pockets, one of which holds the included water bottle. The other is the same size for another bottle, or maybe a pair of goalie gloves. The strap is adjustable in length, with a loop section you could probably hang it by. We haven't taken it to practice yet as the new season doesn't start until spring, but I can tell you this is just the grab-it-and-go bag we have been looking for."

Other then that it's well made and lasts under heavy use. I've had a half dozen of these for training classes and they've held up perfectly for almost five years now. They bend but don't break, hit hard enough to tell you've been struck, but don't leave any lasting injury though they do have a tendency to leave welts with heavy impact where the lighter tanto-style knives do not. I strongly suggest avoiding head shots or wear appropriate protection. Great value-priced training tool."

382925,0,"This item is as most others have said. It is easy to assemble, and it has a feeling of going downhill. It is an uncomfortable feeling, and I have yet to try and prop the item up with anything in an effort to fix it and make it more comfortable.If you are looking for an enexpensive unit this would probably be the one for you. If this is something you know you are going to use very often I would suggest getting one that cost a little more money and that doesnt have any downhill complaints."

403809,0,"This is a good cushion, and is adecuate as a flotation device. What I don't like about the cushion is that instead of it being one solid piece of foam, like the ones we used as kids, it is three or four layers of foam that shift from side to side within the cover. It works fine, but isn't as solid as the ones made from one piece of foam material. I don't think it will hold up as well, but time will tell. Having said that, I think it was a good purchase and would recommend it to those who aren't on the water every week."
395884,0,"I received exactly what I did NOT want-- the NEW version of the Cold Steel Recon 1 Clip Point. The old version is fantatstic, and opens and closes with ease. However , the new version is terribly difficult to close. I had to go to You Tube to understand how to close the blade. The knife itselfis a great knife, beautiful and comfortable to hold. However, the closing is extremely frustrating and a bit dangerous for me. Be careful.The display photo is misleading and should be changed.."
412263,0,"Bad vestibule design. The vestibule is doesn't provide a easy way to enter or exit the tent.The things that get stuck (frost/water) on the vestibule can also get onto your clothes/into tent while entering or leaving the tent.I would have recommended this to any one if the above was the only flaw.But below are some flaws that's really made me not to recommend:On one of the side where the fly doesn't cover fully (i.e. where there is a vent with mesh) water drop get's formed inside the tent caused due to the night's frost. Also there are two sides where the pole get's stuck to the tent is all cloth, if you by mistake hit the cloth while hitting the tent peg - the cloth get's torn. Not really designed for back-country rough use. Tent poles are cheap ones.If you are already shelling out around $80 for this tent I would recommend spend little more and get a different tent (with a fly that covers the tent completely) - not this one, especially for back country camping."
467917,0,"Not bad for the price but the downside is that (1) it keeps on slipping off my 9-month-old twins feet, and (2) the length is not adjustable.So currently it's just hanging there doing nothing. As my twins grow, I'm hoping they'll be able to keep their feet in it. But then again I don't know if it will be comfortable as the length isn't adjustable, and although it's elastic, unless they push it down they'll end up sitting like a frog.We'll see..."

14103,1,this product is very easy to use and is secure.My wife is able to put the rack on the car and load the bikes by herself. The only problem I have is that the straps that secure the bikes tend to strip out. I have had to use the third carrier straps. I would recommend this product to anyone
326426,2,"Despite generally bad reviews for this item, I nonetheless decided to give it a try with my RS800sd monitor. That was a mistake. It failed to work right out of the box. I tried it on two different computers and neither would recognize it. And before you ask, yes, I installed the driver correctly. 45 minutes on the phone with Polar support was of no help. I am very happy with my Polar monitor, but I was very disappointed in the quality of this item and am surprised that Polar would put their name on something as slipshod as this, especially at such a ridiculous price. I was able to locate a USB IRDA Bridge at an online retailer for 1/4 the price and it works just fine. I hope that this is not a sign of things to come from Polar."
372025,2,"The X-Large sweatshirt did not fit my friend who usually wears this size. He is 6' 2"" and 180lbs and this X-Large would fit someone his height but 280lbs or more. The length of the sleeves were great, but the torso and shoulders were very large/wide. A 10 ounce fabric is on the lighter side for a sweatshirt and the inside felt more like polyester than cotton. I was very disappointed with the product and was able to return it, but was responsible for the shipping charges both ways."
356864,0,I bought this in the hopes it would be similar quality to my Brunton 832Echo. Unfortunately there is a reason it was $150 cheaper. Ok for the price($99) but not as clear and bright as my other pair.
334008,0,"I love this knife -- everything about it, EXCEPT the translucent blue plastic which will show dirt underneath it after a couple of years.Since 1982 one of these Swiss Army Classic knives has gone into my pocket every day with my car keys. I have owned only three. The one that I have now is this translucent blue model. Bought it four years ago. It still works great. Does everything that I expect of it. BUT now it looks yucky, showing all the dirt collected from four years in my pocket. So, I am ready to retire this one and go back to a classic red model. That one deserves a full five stars.I cannot live without a Swiss Army Classic knife in my pocket. If they only lasted one year, I would buy a new one every year. For about $12, we are talking a buck a month if you replace it every year. My three knives cost me about $30 total. Since 1982, that works out to about a dollar a year. Huge Bargain!"
446462,0,"The product description says that this product is ""... not to be confused with cheap asian imports... "", but when I received it, it had a label on the bottom of the back of the package that said ""Made in Taiwan""."
414208,0,"Backboard was great value for the money -- except it came with a very large and fairly deep scratch. At first thought it was white paint -- but could feel ridge with fingernail. Rather than to ""mess"" with return -- I purchased special product to polish-out. Not counting time to chase down and purchase polishing product-- it took a couple of hours to polish-out the scratch by hand."
644,0,"This is a nice airbed. It is easy to set up and its comes with a nice smoth top surface so you do not slide off from it. The pillow shape helps a lot if you have a low pillow. The cons are: for some reason, it requires you to inflate it after one use. I think the valve is not strong enough to create a good sealing. And as all airbeds, it helps to place it against a wall to avoind the jello effect. If you can fit it into a corner, that will give you a lot of stabilitty. I like it."
465669,0,I bought this watch 3 months back. I did not like many things in it. It weights too much. It has some cheap plastic buttons which degrade the quality of the watch. The synchronization is also has some lag which I find annoying.The light lights up for very small time even if you keep the button pressed.All in all cheap watch....
480887,0,"Not sure it was designed to be slamed on the ground, but thats one of the ways I warm up before my workout.Beside cracking in half, I liked the ball. I liked the size and grip. It only lasted a dozen workouts, but makes a great place to keep the chalk."
458083,2,"As many other reviewers stated, mat is a little bumpy, but I expected that and I'm sure eventually it'd go flat (or you could iron it), and that alone I was ok with. What I'm not ok with is the fact that even if you do put it right in the hole, it either just sits in the hole or rolls down to the return device and just sits there. After moving the return device around at different angles I eventually got it to return one out of every 4 balls, and even then it only returned it about half way to me, even on short carpet.... I will be looking for a better return putting green."
435271,2,"I added my 2 cents to Tujungan's review below as well, but like he said I think I got a blemished ball. The packaging was sketchy, it came loose in the shipping box with just a bag on it. Some of the letters are already scratched off where it says 'Advanced Microfiber Composite', and some of the seams are very poorly glued, off-center, edges sticking up, etc.I will be returning it and maybe just buying another TF-1000. It's been my favorite ball for years, but I thought I would try something cheaper, I guess that's what happens, you get what you pay for.editted for typo"
176962,1,I bought this as a gift for my godson for Christmas and he loved it. His mother tells me this is now his favorite game in the house even over his gaming systems! Great fun and highly recommended.

342413,1,I received this pack today and was amazed by the quality ... strong material plenty of large pockets and wow get thisTHIS DOES HOLD THE MILITARY EXTREME COLD BAG!! THERE ARE FEW THAT WILL DO THIS!!nice rigid internal frame and a spare bag on top for what ever you needi did get the woodland camo color and i love itgreat pack i plan to put many miles on this one..
488897,1,"Product was exactly as described, works great and good value for low price. Would recommend it to anyone using it for basic distance/steps counted purposes and it stays on your belt all day has never fallen off."
85056,0,it is good for the price. but you cant use heavy bullets or it jams. the tip breaks very easy when i bought my cousin was messing around with it and dropped it and the tip broke off. but it still works. it shoots pretty fast about 300 to 310.
304577,2,"I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers. I really didn't know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow. Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging, it doesn't actually display it. It only uses it to calculate the distance that you've walked. I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked. I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket. I'm just going to buy another pedometer. One that displays the steps walked and has a cover."
128148,0,"it will serve the purpose for which it was made but it is basically a peace of camo burlap with strings tied on to it, i will use it and it should work but if i would have known that this was all that was included i would have saved my money and would have bought some blind material and made my own."
353838,2,"Never have I been so disappointed in a product. I was so excited when it came to find that it was lightweight, easy to set up, roomy, and shady. I loved the design with the screens attached. BUT, after not even two hours in low/moderate wind, one of the roof poles literally shredded in to pieces and one of the legs snapped. Yes, snapped in half.If you're going to use this product in sunny, perfect weather, then there's nothing wrong with it. But, it can't stand up to ANY little tiny bit of bad weather, so be prepared."
418185,2,"Got these for the ipong, but they don't bounce, so they go out of the ipong and just plop on the table..do not recommend as I need to find some that bounce well."
356388,0,"We received this hammock as a gift but returned it because the hammock is made of padded material, almost like a bedding. This is comfortable I'm sure, but we live in a very rainy area where that type of material would deteriorate quickly. So we are opting for the traditionally cord style. Not a bad hammock, but might not work in all climates."
243379,2,"After only a few months of using it, I realized the plastic inside of the lock was cracked. I don't know why or how this happened, or if I was provided a defective product at the beginning. It still works as a lock, but the straight part of the lock falls into three pieces (literally) when it's not connected to the curved half, and it takes a bit of fiddling to put it back together so it can be used. Would not recommend."
361261,1,"It's a fine example of the tried-and-true classic: the ab wheel.The two plastic wheels slide onto the center of the handle. The handles are made of a hollow steel tube. Slip-on handlebar grips give you a secure hold on the device and serve to hold everything together.The tread is nothing more than hard plastic, so make sure not to use it on your priceless antique Persian rug unless you want to cut the rug to ribbons.Ab wheels are one of the best ways to develop a strong core. Follow Everlast's directions -- which teach you how to progress from easy versions of the movement to more difficult ones -- and you'll soon be rolling your way to victory (and beyond)!"
46204,0,"I bought the brake to put onto the front wheel of a 16-inch bike for my kid. The brake is in good quality. But it takes me quite a while to put it on. First, you have to use WD-40 to take the grip off. In the process of twisting the grip with tool, be careful not to destroy the plastic like I almost did. Then you have to cut the wire and the casing. The casing is quite strong and not easy to cut. Then you have to take the brake apart and replace the axle (1.5 inch is too short) with the other axle with 2 inch length to mount. Be warned that the front screw is very tight. I managed to put it on the bike after putting it off several weeks. The seller's support is useful. But it is not as easy as I thought."
231338,1,"This is the best water purifying system I have used. Fill the bag with lake water, hang on a tree branch, open the valve and you have drinkable water.

473339,1,"I bought this bike in 2006 at Dick's. I ride at least twice a week and I ride hard. I ride from the the top of Pike's Peak here in Colorado Springs on a regular basis and it hasn't faultered yet. I weight 215lbs so construction quality and frame strength isn't an issue. My only complaint would be that there isn't a disc brake in the rear, but that can be fixed pretty easily. Excellent bike for an excllent price!"

241654,0,"If you are a child for petite woman under 90 pounds you will find this is a great value. But this quickly becomes a poor kayak if you weigh more. a 150 pound person over 5 feet tall will have an extremely uncomfortable time on a lake because the rear seat is so low, you will be slouching. On a river this might be okay if you are just going down river. If you are 200 pounds do not consider this. Your weigh will make a dip in a the canoe and you will be the lowest thing bumping along the bottom of the river. With your legs in the air you will find it exhausting to paddle. Adding a canoe seat won't help-- your legs will still be in the air.However for a child it's great. it's light weight and easy to maneuver. my 60 pounder sat forward in this and had ablast controlling it in waves and wind on a lake. The short, adjustable and light weigh paddle is actually a bonus for a kid: they won't care it's flimsy by adult standards and the weight is better for them.It's got about 15 pinch nozzles to fill. Which is not awful but is annoying to deflate. You cannot properly inflate the main tubes with your lungs, or a standard matress blower. You need a hand or foot pump. And if you don't the raft will bend if you way over 100 pounds. THe side valves do not fit any standard pinch valve or coleman valve inflators so be sure to buy one made for a seveylor."
292759,0,I like being able to purchase gloves in so many colors but have found the life of these gloves is short. Wear on the palm quickly.
150637,0,I usually wear a medium and am fine with the with of the shirt and the length but when I got this shirt it was huge pretty much a Large. If you are to buy this shirt then I would say to buy a size smaller than what you usually wear.The shirt itself though is good quality and comfy to wear.Would recommend this shirt for anyone.
181151,0,"This case is truly the minimum in storing and protecting a hand gun. It has thin walls and the closure snaps don't stay closed. It's probably fine for storing a ""mouse gun,"" but anything bigger like a medium frame or heavier small frame gun will keep popping the snaps open. In any case I would use this for storage only and basic transport. I would not use this to take tot the shooting range. If one were to drop it the contents would likely pop right out. you would have to use secondary lock on it to prevent that from happening. I ended up purchasing a new, superior box for less money at a local shop. Like I said, its barely worth the money and it only does the barest minimum job of safely storing your gun."
260449,0,It arrived in the time specified. Two of the lanterns worked great but the third does not work at all. Something seems to be wrong with the switch and will not turn on when switched to the on position.

407801,2,"This sleeping bag feels so thin and vulnerable that I sent it back right away. The outer layer isn't attached to the insulation and inner layer, and therefore the inside part of the sleeping bag can twist around: you will find yourself stuck in your sleeping bag...All the fabric feels very thin too. I don't recommend this bag for outdoor camping if you want it to last long. Maybe it is good as an extra sleeping bag at home for sleepovers?I bought a North Face Dolomite instead and are much more happy with that purchase. So spend a little more money and get a decent quality sleeping bag."
151241,0,"Bought this watch to wear walking, it was very eye-catching and (I thought) worth the money, but it didn't fit! The band was not as flexible as I expected, and it did not fit comfortably on my wrist. I'd say it runs small, so if you have a larger wrist, I wouldn't reccomend. Otherwise, it is very cute."
231573,1,"product is of exceptional quality, fits well and the measurements listed on the site are accurate"
137075,0,"This product helps you set your wrists at the top of the backswing but I don't know if it helps all that much at&#34;the moment of truth.&#34; I know the logic behind it makes sense, if you're not at the right position at the top, you can't get into the right position at the bottom of the swing. It's a little hard to get used to the feel. The strength of the product is that it helps you distinguish between feel and real at the wrist hinge/top of the swing position."
274025,0,"Columbia Sportswear Men's Cathedral Peak Vest. I ordered two of these, one grey and one Tusk color. I really like the Tusk. These run a little bit small and should have just a bit more length to them. I'm 6'3"" tall and normally an extra large works fine for me, but not in this vest. I would have ordered an extra large Tall, but they don't come in the Tall size.I really like the fleece feel and the two outside zipper pocket, but it would be nice if they had an inside pocket, like Columbia puts on the inside of their Cougar Peaks outerwear."

Where this device is placed puts it in her way getting in and out. For someone transferring to and from a standing position it would be fine. We could have looked more carefully at the photo before ordering."
341003,1,"Good Pedometer, reasonable price. It is very accurate, I have tested it against several known standards and it is very close. It stays attached easily and when it does come loose it just slips out of the carrier and the stop strap keeps it from falling and breaking. Only criticism I have is that the stop strap which is white nylon fabric gets dirty. Maybe some other material or color would be better. But it works great, is accurate, inexpensive and very durable. Can't really ask for more."
33406,0,"I like prAna. The material is stretchy and the shirt hasn't lost it's shape after many uses/washes. I never have to adjust it, no matter how hard the practice is. My only complaint is that it feels a little hot, and when it gets sweaty, it doesn't really wick the sweat away from your skin. All in all, I don't think that's much of a problem, and would purchase prAna again."
186854,0,"I have had this same basic bag about ten years. Most of that time I was only riding paved surfaces, and just wanted a place to put my cell phone and garage door opener. Here recently I took it on its first mountain biking experience and wanted it to hold a tube, tire levers, and a bike tool. The bag has no problems holding the tool, tire levers, and tube when you ride a fairly smooth surface, but when I started bumping on the rougher surfaces of the mountain bike trails, the hook and loop closures on the top did not hold the weight. In all fairness I was only able to use a smaller portion of the hook and loop to hold it due to the way the seat is on my bike. If you are able to use all of it, you may have better luck, however if your going to go bouncing down a mountain bike trail, I would look for an option that uses more than a hook and loop closure. If your riding smooth paved trails, this bag will be fine."
265024,0,"Pros: The price I paid for these sleeping bags for my two children ($29.99 each) was a great value. The exterior fabric is nice and it has a great stuff bag with a carrying handle. It rolls up small and compact. The ""mummy"" top can be sinched up to create a hood on cold nights.Cons: The polyester fabric on the inside is cold in cold weather. When the weather is hot, it doesn't breath, so it becomes very uncomfortable. The zip out sheet SOUNDS like a great idea, but it's very flimsy and with my children it just ends up being kicked down to the bottom of the sleeping bag. If I had it to do all over again, I would buy a sleeping bag that had a cotton interior. That is the major drawback with this bag. The fabric makes all the difference on how warm/cool you stay at night and this interior just doesn't meet the muster."
505599,1,"The device is smaller than expected; just over an inch;we weren't sure if it was going to work for us, but we bought it in a pinch.I have a generic heart rate monitor, and it worked just fine;just press the button and it starts recording the time of mine.The program that comes with it is not all that great;there are features to make graphs and keep records, but other features could've been added easily, to make better use of the heart rate.A nice function is being able to export to excel;if you are good at using the program, you can make better graphs, utilize the data, and that's pretty much all I have to tell.P.S. Its definitely worth the price;i didn't have to save up by only eating rice!"

142711,0,"I bought these to use at my local indoor range as some reviewers said they were good for this purpose. After all, they have one of the highest NRR available. However, when I tried them at the gun range, they didn't perform as expected. I even added double protection (ear plugs) but it was not enough, my ears were ringing after the session. Perhaps I'm too sensitive to loud noises and that's why they didn't do the trick for me. I was looking for something good at a reasonable price, but I guess I will have to spend more money if I really want to protect my hearing."

308959,1,"I am relatively pleased with this product, HOWEVER, the side velcro snaps did become undone during the sleep cycle. I ordered the twin size because it is larger than the regular size because I am 140 pounds and thought this would give me more than ample room to turn while sleeping. The side velcro closure did become undone near the top. This product is so luxurious feeling to fall asleep in that I look forward to my next travel where I can use it again and nor worry about the cleaniness of the hotel bed linens. I would buy it again even with the side openers being a little disappointing. I am happy with the top flap that slides over the pillow but usually take my own pillow with me. It would suffice even if I forgot to take my own pillow. The company also has separate pillow covers for those who do not take their own pillow. Great Christmas gift for a traveler."

273826,0,"I assumed, wrongly, that this would fit standard Mountain Hardwear tent zippers. I think the instructions specifically mention tents, but check your tent's zipper size before buying this. I've never seen a backpacking tent with zippers this large, and the parts in this kit are very much too large for my Mountain Hardwear tent.I'm sure there will be a reason to use this in the future, and it looks like a good system, but it will stay in my gear for now. I'll probably sent the tent to MHW for repair."
339101,1,"The pedometer itself is great and is everything I had hoped for. The clip to wear it on your belt is not very good. The clip portion is too short and the spring is not strong enough. If the clip was similar to the one on my cell phone, I would rate the pedometer 5+. If I try to play golf with it on my belt, it falls off, and it will even fall off sometimes when I bend over."
156780,2,This shirt ran very small! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it. The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need.
299389,1,Great product! I have more than enough space and it handles like a smaller bag. Only complaint is that I would have liked more substantial fence clips. There are two of them and they'll probably never fail but they don't seem as durable as the rest of the bag is.

It's the lack of directions that informed my rating (3 stars). The grill itself worked absolutely fantastic."
508704,1,"The Hollywood F1B was exactly what I wanted to carry our bikes for a recent camping trip. Easy to fit and fasten, it worked perfectly on my 2010 Fusion (with no damage to the finish, either). With just a little readjusting, it fit 3 full-size bikes. Only one has a horizontal bar, so the other two bikes rested on their angled frame pieces. The lack of individual frame clips and straps was actually an advantage for this arrangement. The mounting straps do loosen somewhat as the padding compresses, so stopping to retighten the straps after the first half-hour or so (as someone else suggested) kept everything snug and secure. Took off one star because the rack comes with only two tie-downs even though it's a 3-bike rack. I purchased 3 pairs of 2-foot long bungee cords that worked wonderfully for holding the bike frames to the rack. The center strap that goes around all three bikes is a nice extra security feature. Once tightened down, those bikes weren't going anywhere until we took them off at the campground. A good value for the money!"

Then the next day in the morning I was shooting at a target and a piece snapped off inside, when I took the gun apart I found it it was the piece that holds the gun when cocked had broken off. It was a tiny plastic piece that holds like 10lbs of pressure...The other gun is fine with no problems so far except that it curves upward a little.Surprisingly tiny..Cons...Cheap plastic, no metal partsCurved shootingSmall clip (9 pellets)Pros...Really fun to play withDoesn't hurt, but shoots 30ftEasy to take apart and put together"
131795,0,"These magnesium and FEU fire starters are good but not great. The small diameter sparking rod, about the same diameter as a pencil lead is only good for about 50 or so strikes, and scraping the magnesium off the opposite side is a hassle. The Swedish fire steels are a much better alternative because they combine the magnesium powder within the sparking rod creating more sparks, and no need to scrape a pile of magnesium before striking, and the strike bar lasts for many hundreds of strikes. That said, these tools are very inexpensive and do perform as advertised. I recommend buying the ones with the small striker attached (made of a 2"" piece of hack saw blade). If you use the back of a knife for striking the spark you'll vastly limit the number of available strikes."

With this level of both customer care and commitment to improving their products, Gerber fails miserably. I Therefore consider this tool only a little better than a rock.

266014,1,"I prefer this trap to another trap I've used for a couple of years principally because the closing door mechanism is 'spring loaded'. My old one closes by gravity aloneHavahart 1025 Two-Door 18 x 5 x 5-Inch Cage Trap for Squirrels, I only use one of the 2-doors anyway and I had to start placing a rock on top of the open door just to get the door to close quicker and more securely. Before the rock, I had a couple of animals trigger the trap and still be able to escape. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting a 'spring loaded' trap like this one if you are a first timer to the trap buying scene. I got a second trap so I could enhance my odds at success since [some of] my older 'wabbits can come in from two different sides of my property and avoid a single trap. This approach allows me to relocate the critters safely. Great for cottontails, ground squirrels, rats and an occasional bird who gets adventurous. While I bought my 1st trap to get the bunnies, I was shocked to find out that I had an even bigger ground squirrel problem than I would have ever imagined. Ground squirrel populations can really undermine your property, even though you don't see their burrows and tunnels. Now both 'wabbits and ground squirrels are under control, at least on my property. My trapping approach allows me to relocate the critters which makes my wife happy. I use cut up apple cores and carrots as bait since I've tried other baits and they don't seem to work as well. You can also use sprinkled BLOOD MEAL fertilizer as a repellent for 'wabbits. It is found in the garden section of hardware-type stores. 'Wabbits stay away because they interpret the smell as a site of a former kill by the resident animal predator. I use it when the trapping events are at a lull."
231397,0,"Okay...I have gone back and forth over the last year or so on whether or not to purchase these shoes for my 6 yo son. I bit the bullet when I found them 1/2 off and they were a great purchase for him. He is very athletic, coordinated, strong and he has had a few tumbles while wildly jumping around so I can see where other posters are concerned about kids safety. As with anything like this, there is an inherent risk associated, so we do require my son to where a helmet and wrist guards while using them...you have to use common sense. Getting the elastic straps on the shoes was an honest to goodness struggle - it was a wrestling match and if you are not careful, the elastic bands can snap and hurt you (again, an inherent risk that a rational person could foresee - these are like giant rubber bands - so be careful)...Overall, the shoes were a good buy for my son - he uses them on a regular basis and since we live in the Northeast, these are a blessing in the winter (another great way to let him burn off some energy....which if you have a wild 6 yo boy, you will certainly understand where I am coming from...)so far, the quality has been fine...the shoes have held up and straps have not broken.."
301579,1,"I'm not a dress-up kind of guy. To me a watch is like any other tool - meant to be durable and functional. That being said, this thing really doesn't look too shabby. I could see it going just fine with a decent suit if it wasn't too banged up and you dressed it up with an oyster band.Appearances aside, this watch is actually a replacement for my Timex Expedition 4 WS. I wore the Expedition for almost three years, and it served me well, but certain things about it were annoying, not least the weird proprietary watch bands. I also tried other ABC watches (including the meteorically popular Suunto Core) and had the same issues, more or less. I realized I didn't actually want a wunderwatch, and that all the bells and whistles were typically more of a hassle than they were actually worth. Having to calibrate the barometers was a real pain, the compass, while decent, was actually never used except as a party trick, and about the only advanced feature that really got any button-presses was the extra timezone, which saves only a brief mental calculation when trying to figure out what time it is at home when I'm abroad.I decided to get back to basics, and go with a watch that really just does one thing really well - telling time legibly and reliably. Some reviewers have complained that this Seiko diver loses or gains a minute or so in a week, or is difficult to exactly synchronize because the second hand continues to sweep while setting the time.Listen: Get real. It is not meant to be, nor is it advertised as, a precision chronometer. If that's what you really need, or even just want, in a wristwatch, go get one that is. Even scrambling around out in the middle of the boondocks on a tight schedule, when my life can sometimes depend on having an accurate timepiece, even an entire minute in 24 hours is not distressing to me, let alone a minute a week. In fact, checking it against the atomic clock it was set by a week ago tells me it is less than a minute off, which is unsurprising given that I didn't synchronize the second hands when I set it.This Seiko keeps good time, has had no hiccups, and is very legible in the dark. The bezel is sturdy and not obnoxiously loud when twisted into place. My only criticism for legibility is the amount of time it takes for the Day/Date to fully switch over. The date knocks over first, starting around 22:30 and clicking in just a hair before midnight, and the day moves over a period of about 3.5 hours between midnight and 03:30, making a brief stop on the alternate language's day (in this case, Spanish). It's not really a big deal, since the likelihood is high that you'll be sleeping while it's clicking over, and that it's easy to tell what day it is after the first few times you look at it in such a condition.Now, one of the really excellent features: The luminous markings are fantastic. They're painted with a new, non-radioactive compound called LumiBrite and are actually quite a bit better than the Promethium used in older watches. They do require a bit of light to ""charge"", but will do so reliably even indoors under artificial light. They are BRIGHT, and the luminous properties are supposed to have a useful lifetime many times longer than Promethium or Tritium based paints, which fade to unusability over a period of 5-10 years depending on the isotope and concentration.One of the best and probably most overlooked features is the offset crown. If you work with your hands, you'll appreciate it the first time you notice the callous on the back of your hand has faded away.A few words of warning:If this is your first Seiko automatic, particularly with this movement (""movement"" is watch terminology for the mechanism that makes the hands spin around!) be sure to read the instructions carefully when setting the time. If you don't, the Day/Date function will not operate properly, leaving you very confused within a matter of twelve hours or so of first getting your new watch. The instructions aren't difficult, just a little bit involved. Take it slow the first time, read the instructions twice before fussing with the watch, and think before you act. A few tries and it'll be second nature.Next: This is a gray market watch when bought from K.G. Company - the warranty card is included, but is not stamped or filled out. If you're not sure what ""gray market"" means in regards to watches, look it up and be sure you're okay with that before you order. I don't know for sure about ones ordered from Amazon.com, but I would suspect that they are gray market as well based on the price. I took the gamble based on the fact that I know several folks with Seiko divers nearing 20 years of hard use."

344532,0,"There were two problems I encontered with this handcuff. First, this particular brand is thicker than most handcuffs, so it didn't fit into my Bianchi dual handcuff holster.

It is cut about as thin as a real sword. which makes the practice weapon weigh a lot less, very breakable (thus unreasonable to spar with), and bent about the last 3-4 inches of the ""blade"". I don't recommend this for anyone wanting to spar and I do suspect that others are not as bent. This bokken is extremely breakable, problem is they do not say that it is a light bokken as opposed to the regular. 2 broken wooded swords out of 5.P.S.

I have not taken the bikes a long distance, so you will have to rely on others for how this holds up over the long haul. I could not see any real benefits from racks that cost twice as much.

273466,0,"I bought this pair of goggles mainly because of the good reviews on Amazon. The following is based on my personal experience with the polarizing brown version this product on a 3-day ski trip: I found the overall quality of these goggles acceptable. They easily fit over my medium size glasses. I found it easier for my ears to raise the handles of my glasses to sit above my ears in order to reduce the pressure caused by the goggles' stretch bands. However, there are two somehow annoying issues with these goggles: the first one is that these goggles slide down and put pressure on your nose, making it harder to breath. I admit that this is a person-specific issue and it depends on the shape of the face and the nose so others may not have the same problem, nevertheless I still believe it's a design issue. I did not have such a problem with another brand of goggles (Smith Knowledge). Another problem I found was that the polarizing lens was creating optical illusions -- such as wavy ridges when actually looking at a flat snow surface at a close range. My eyes got used to it very soon but still it was not the best experience. This problem may be specific to the polarizing brown version, or even -- out of bad luck -- my copy of the goggles but I decided to share my experience with others anyhow knowing this could be the case.Based on this experience I will definitely consider trying the goggles on before buying them from now on. If you have to buy online, considering the overall quality and value, I think the cheaper version of these goggles are in the acceptable range, especially if you have a small (not wide) nose."
215264,1,"The going price of $14 or $15 per road tire, Kenda Kontender, isan amazing value for the quality contained therein.I've had these tires for at least 5 years, on my road Fuji at least,and they're still going strong. The replacement only occurs after anextremely high level of km, at which point, the rubber cover is gone,and a plastic blue layer becomes visible. It still works, but the tirewill no longer contain the inflated tube at that point. So, the replacementbecomes necessary.In my particular case, the choice falls on the k-shield Kenda Kontendermeaning, kevlar bead, which add no extra weight, and no loss of handling,but an extremely high level of protection in terms of 30 km of gravel androck riding, without a single afterthought of needing to pack an air pump,or tube repair kit, since it will protect from a to z the interior air pressured tube.A winner."
156882,2,"The thing to remember with this volleyball set is the price - you can only expect so much for under $20. This isn't a horrible set, but for me it was a frustrating one. First of all, the case that it comes in is surprisingly nice for the price...fairly sturdy and with wheels on the bottom. In my opinion you have two choices with this set: either you set this up above ground and do not use the pole anchors, or you have to have help. I set this up by myself and had the first pole anchor very easily bend while trying to set the pole, and the second one simply snapped off (which I would assume was a defect as the ground was definitely not that hard). So if you do want to use the anchors push them in VERY carefully and have someone hold the poles upright while you set the anchors. While on the topic of anchors, don't trust the knots as I had 3 out of the 4 simply unravel while pushing these in. It would have been far easier for me to tie them correctly myself before starting the setup of the net, than to try and fix it once started. Lastly, the ball itself is actually surprisingly decent for the price. I intend to give this set away and try the Halex to see if it's any better."

Another thing, the box looked like someone had kicked it back already, all nasty and taped up. I was leary to accept the delivery for that reason alone!! I've gotten up on the thing 4x and am trying to give it a chance, but it does not feel good.

I mean the blade extends and retracts to/from the same housing, which is closed (and plastic) and doesn't have any ""holes"" built into it to allow fish blood/guts/etc., to leak out of.So, all that great length extends out of, basically, a pocket for fish guts. Every inch of extended blade means an inch more storage (in the handle) for ugly.Don't use this knife if you're trying to teach your kids/wife/whatever about fishing.

I emailed the company to see what they have to say about this.I took it for a ride anyway, but the front of the saddle put too much pressure on the back of my legs. I believe this would be resolved if I could move the seat farther back.I only had slightly more pressure on my hands before. However, I seem to be prone to numbness in my hands and this was enough to cause issues for me. I'm not sure if I could make this go away the proper adjustment.For some reason, I was noticeably slower. Not sure what to attribute that to. I think that would improve with time, if I were able to get the seat adjusted properly.That being said, I think this could be a workable seat if you have a straight post on your bike and like to sit relatively upright.

15057,1,"I bought this for Burning Man as I was to be out in the desert of northern Nevada for 8 days. It sure did beat digging through duffel bags for clothes, and with the side organizer pockets, that also came in handy storing my small electronics, ear plugs, toilet paper and so on. Even the little clip on one of the sides came in handy as I used it to clip a small trash bag to it. I knew it wasn't going to keep the playa dust off my clothes with the mesh front (nothing keeps playa dust away), but I just love having an organized tent so this was a great addition to myEureka! Copper Canyon 10 Five- to Six-Person 10-Foot by 10-Foot Family Tent. Sets up in a minute and tears down just as easily. Even if I was going camping for a weekend, I would still take it with me. After showing my friends what it looks like set up, I think they will be buying this for next years Burning Man event."
130354,0,This is great for picnics or just in the backyard. the only problem is that after you wash it the blanket becomes almost too slippery to put it back in the holder that well so that is why I am only giving it 3 stars.
180876,1,Great features for a very good price. Looked around until found one with all of the features wanted - found this one for a very good price. The seller packaged it very well.
275876,0,...everything I hoped it would be! Price could be lower though! Three stars because of price.
394166,2,"These shorts were awful!! I returned them the next day. They were paper thin, poorly sewn and unwearable!"
187864,0,"I purchase my Schwinn Meridian in March of 2010. I love my Trike, I would give it 5 Stars, however I'm experiencing a noise in the rear of the Trike, I have oiled and tighten the outer bolts of the drive shaft but it continues to make a loud clicking sound when I'm ride the Trike. Also on two occasions my granddaughter has gotten her shoe string caught on the chain guard finder. The chain guard finder is not very sturdy, in fact very flimsy! But I do love my Trike."
223279,0,"I like the mount and look forward to using it. However, when i saw it on Amazon it showed 3 mounts and the Product Features say 2-piece mount. When i received it, there was only 1 small mount plate and 2 screws included. Either ad is very misleading or they messed up order. I am waiting for reply from Price Pros....."
29918,1,"These shorts are awesome. They are extremely light-weight; it's almost as if you can't even feel them. They are quite long (I'm 6' and the large size hung right at or a little below my knees), but I've worn them running and they didn't bother me. These are perfect for lounging or going to the gym (I use them for running as well). Just two complaints: 1) no pockets, and 2) they are virtually see-through (I got the red color and they're still see through), so I'd recommend getting a dark, dark color. Other than that, the shorts are great!"
231724,0,"I haven't had a chance to use this product yet. I just wanted to let others know that the contact time with the water is 4 hours. If I would have know that, I might have chosen a different product. I am sure that this is an otherwise fine product."
505326,0,"I got into Turbofire because I got into Taebo. The progression was Taebo which I loved but got bored of (and couldn't stand the counting to 8 all the time). Plus Turbo has better music. Then I did turbojam. But it got too easy and in a search for something more challenging I then did Chalean Extreme. Loved it because it was like P90x but not crazy, It was doable. But Chalean didn't gave much cardio. Then I got Turbofire. I love the music. It has Salt n Peppa and New Edition! Or atleast covers of their songs. I like many of the new moves like fire throw and double bob where you are skipping sort of. It is not as intense as insanity but intense enough to burn 500 cal in a workout if you really get down low and wear weighted gloves. Unless you have already done Turbojam you will find it really really hard to follow along. And she's not as good about telling you what foot to start on. It definitely took me about 2 weeks to get the moves but now I know them and they are still fun and challenging enough to keep it interesting.I'm giving it a 3 because I can't do the workout any more because of injury. Chalean really needs to say more about pivoting and also include knee warm-ups and stretching/strengthening exercises because the workouts totally depend on pain free feet, ankles, and legs. This series has a lot more movement that has friction with the floor. I workout on hard wood but still have pain. The pivoting and the ski moves (like you are doing the running man) are just too much friction with the floor and it either goes to my Plantar fascia or my knees. I have to ice the bottom of my feet now and my knees. Although the pivoting works core and abs it really is hard on the knees and feet. Taebo doesn't have pivoting so I never had that problem before. I think if I just marched in place and punched to the front instead of to opposite sides I would be ok. And for the ski moves I just jog it out rather than slide my feet like that. But the fast paced moves make it easy to injure yourself. I find I have to be careful with seven step and clockwork and that one where you punch lunge and turn..forget the name - its a basic move. In Turbojam I also has some injury but since it was slower it was easier to watch myself and be careful and deliberate. But I will have to wait until I heal to try again. I also agree that the warmup is too fast. The tempo is twice as fast as Turbojam. A few times I just turned it off in the beginning because the tempo was just insane."
64512,0,This is a fairly good scooter but it has two problems. By the way this is my moms account I'm actually a guy but that isn't all that important. First and formost it has a wheelie bar making tailwhips and many other tricks twice as dangerous. If anybody knows the point of them please feel free to tell me. Also it isn't that sturdy and I broke mine jumping a gap. If your seriosly into scootering get the pro model and if you just hate wheelie bars like me get the A model.Razor Pro Model Kick Scooter (Clear or Red)
496213,0,The shirts are nice but the sizes are extremely roomy. I bought a couple of these for my dad who is pretty stocky and always wears and x-large but these were very big on him.
258168,0,"This is overall a pretty decent nightlight; however, the glass part tends to turn when you just barely touch it. If it is placed somewhere that you won't need to move it, then the problem doesn't really affect you at all. This was purchased for a kids sports-themed room and makes a GREAT addition to the decor. It doesn't look like your typical cheap plastic nightlight, because it isn't. Very affordable and stylish."
476132,0,These tees were soft and perfect when I pulled them out of the package. After a few washes they lost their softness and shrank about 2 inches. My husband is very tall and these ended up way too short on him after that....we ditched and switched to Jersey brand!
60110,1,"Once adjusted properly, the seat performed as advertised. Like any other seat, it took some getting used to but I'm more concerned with my anatomy than a few days of discomfort. Good job."
149414,1,"I waited to write a review on this saddle until I really tried it out on the road. After riding over 100 miles with this saddle I can honestly say I am so happy with this product!! I bought it for my new bike after I went numb in a ""delicate area"" following a 40-mile ride with the factory bike saddle. I looked all over the internet for a gel seat (made for women) that is affordable and this saddle met all my criteria. My average ride distance is 25-50 miles and I haven't experienced any discomfort since I began using it. It looks great and is durable; worth every penny and more!!"
100688,1,"This was just right for me - large enough to hold a spare tube, repair kit, and much more (but not large enough for a smartphone, but I don't need that).Attaches easily and fits well under my seat, and seems to be made of solid materials. Not sure how durable the zipper will be after long, outdoor use (that's how my old Canondale bag failed).I'd recommend this."
323924,1,"i bought this for about eighty-five dollars from amazon nearly a year ago. i am an amateur collegiate triathlete and wanted to use this in training. i rated this 5/5 stars not because it is perfect beyond my expectations, but because it is just what it claims to be, and does its job very effectively. overall, polar makes quality products - i recently used a similar hrm from their line in a VO2max test.(+) the connection between the watch and strap is consistent and i have not run into any interference.(+) the strap is comfortable - but don't be surprised that you may have to wet the contact points of the strap to give the contacts a good reading(+) it's easy to look back through your most recent exercise session data to gather time in chosen hr zone, what the zone was, total exercise zone, # kcal burned and what % of that was fat, and avg hr(-) it would be nice to show a max hr, but it's really not necessary unless you're doing a maximum exertion test. you'll either know you're already out of your ideal training zone (for whatever type of training you're chosen it to be), or will be slightly over (or under) in which case you'll be notified by an audible alarm(-) a split workout feature would be the nicest addition possible to this watch, although it is not advertised to have one and does what it does well without itdon't be swayed by negative reviews that suggest this is poor because it's not waterproof (wrong: it's actually water ""resistant"" to 30m, which means that nothing will happen to the watch up to that point, but that pressing buttons underwater will break the seal, allowing the higher pressurized water to come in and damage your new toy), that the chest strap makes poor contact, or that it isn't a full-fledged hrm. many reviews don't seem to recognize what this hrm was designed to do in the first place, either shorting the rating because they can't read directions in a booklet/online, or are comparing it to more expensive models. this watch does what it was designed to do quite well, and quite comfortably."
123620,1,"I first read this book before I was a sports fan. It is the best sports biography I've ever read. Not only a biography of a superlative athlete who is virtually unknown today, but a heart rending portrait of racism in sport."
382271,0,Was too small for my 9 yr old granddaughter. Would have been better if the band were larger and maybe more velcro.
373251,2,"There's something about it that I just don't look forward to using it.You definitely get what you paid for. It does it job but it feels flimsy and cheap and the pastel purple I got added to the cheap feel factor.I guess for me its a chore to workout and it would help to have something pretty to look at while I'm miserably holding a plank, but instead I'm staring at gridlines and an ugly color. I know for next time to spend the extra few bucks for something nicer. =P"
365404,0,"Overall this is an okay karate uniform. The material is light yet feels robust and the stiching is good. However, beware of the drawstring pants as there are good size slits in the hips which can expose ones underwear. If one is skinny it may not be a problem, otherwise decorum necessitates safety pins or a sewing job."
374809,2,It's nice that this basket is cheap and cute but the plastic smells terrible with a rotten fishy oder. Washing it helps some but only temporarily. The worst part is the bad fishy smell transferred to the stuffed animals that my daughter put in the basket. Avoid the chemical exposure and spend your money on something else.
128369,0,"Fundamentals Of Boxing/Advanced Punching Techniques were both good but it seems that he talked more than showed. I'm a Freddie Roach fan! He could combined both of these DVDs. 3 stars for the techniques explaned would be 5 if didn't talk so much.Punching Bag Training is 5 stars. Anyone wanting to learn how to hit the Heavy Bag,work the Double End and Speed bag, this is a very good DVD. He even covers some advanced technniques. I guess I expected more from a championship trainer."
394292,0,"I found the fit to be odd, both too tight at the cuffs and baggy elsewhere. They're also very thin and a bit more... revealing than other similar shorts.The chamois is comfortable, thin and soft.Aside from a few small issues, they're great. Just don't expect high-end tailoring or materials."
333230,1,"I love these tires. I have put over 1000 miles on them now, commuting 20 miles round trip and just tooling around town. They are very tight and difficult to mount the first time--which is why no 5th star--but it can be done. Now I find them quite simple to put on (I've had several flats, as is inevitable with the amount of riding I do).They grip reasonably well in wet conditions, and have held up nicely over the one very short section of rugged trail I ride as part of my commute (about 50 feet of rocky, rutty hard packed dirt on a steep incline)."
178746,2,"I ordered this item, thinking it was a pair. When I received it and realized my error, I ordered another of the exact same item. When I got it, I found that it was half an inch wider (so not the same fit around the wrist) than the first, a different shade of color, and the pile seemed thinner and flattened.Now I'm ordering a pair from a different company. Hopefully the higher price indicates better quality."
360682,0,"The product is ok, but the bar does not stay in place very well to hold the feet down."
405555,0,"These are good shorts, but not nearly the utility, design or materials of the discontinued Cliff Lakes from Columbia. I go through three or so pairs of these each year. Yeah, basically live in them much of the year. Hiking, biking, whatever. Probably will shop around for something better."
186130,1,Assembly instructions as well as operating instructions were almost useless something was lost in the translation... The workmanship was of good quality also the fit and finish were as well. This unit is not for the Toyota FJ Cruiser as you only are able to open the rear door less than half way even with the fold down feature enabled making the loading of large dogs with the unit attached a difficult task.
226277,0,The sock is good quality but a little too thick for me. I would recommended for colder climate areas of the country.
1479,1,Excellent Product for Outdoor Military Duty in heat exceding 110 Degrees. Best choice of all Under Armour products for use as underwear in extreme high and cold tempearture environments.
494752,0,"I placed this product on my wish list and received it for Christmas. I was disappointed, however, to find that the pendant is very light and flimsy and does not appear to be very high quality. I have not decided whether to keep it or return it at this point."
507948,0,"I bought a small and they were way to big. I am 5'7"" and they would go 3-4 inches below my knees. Great quality though, I wish they fit better."
449028,2,"you get what you pay for with this bike. it looks ok but feals very cheap. the chain guard and fenders have to be bent into place due to poor packaging, they are made out of very thin sheet metal so its easy to bend. the only things that need to be installed or tightened down are the seat, handle bars and neck, pedals, fenders, and the front wheel. i also needed to adjust brakes. it rides nice but i doubt it will last more than a couple years without needing a chain or spockets or crank bearings. i wouldn't be suprized if the fork bent on this thing too, just from normal riding. thanks china!"
164837,0,"I bought these to replace some ice packs that were lost. After following the instructions, and reading reviews here, I was able to get each pocket to fully fill. It did take some time. I recommend filling your sink with water, submerging the sheets while kneading them. Then walk away for a while and let them expand. After 10 minutes or so, knead again until all the pockets are full. I cut the sheets down to sandwich bag size, and zipped them in. There's absolutely no mess or leaking of gel. They're very easy to refreeze and use again.The reason for only 3 stars is that they do not stay solid for very long. I still have some old packs similar to what was lost. When I used both recently, the old packs were still solid after 7 hours in my cooler, which was kept in my trunk in 50 degree weather. These packs were mushy at the end of the same time period."
259403,1,Nice well made product. Seems sturdy. Can clip it to your binocular strap so anywhere you go you'll be able to wipe the lenses if needed. Cloth is sewn into the pouch so you don't need to worry about it falling out.
107513,1,"Excellent purchase/choice, my husband loves the shorts....says they're very comfortable and likes the fact it has the cargo pockets on the leg."
377274,1,This kit is an essential for a bicycle rider. It is neat and easy to carry around. Perfect for restocking your bicycle repair bag.
98288,0,"First of all the table was broke and was necessary to wait 10 more days to finally has it changed.It was necessary 2 persons to set the table and was hard to do it because the legs didn't fit well where they were supposed to fit. For one leg I actually used the help of a hammer.After the table was set, was just fun. It's a simple and nice table."
468508,2,"Under 'Product Features' it said:Product Features100% ring-spun cotton with a soft feel for long-lasting comfortNow I'm not real sure what ""100% ring-spun cotton..."" is, and neither did my wife when she ordered these for me, BUT we do know that it doesn't mean ""58% polyester/42% cotton"" as it says in the tag!!!We have bought Russel Athletic Pro Cotton shirts from other sellers, and they always said 100% cotton on the tags! These just don't breath it the hot summer humidity."
210896,0,"This kite is a lot of fun, handles really well and is super easy to get up without needing help from a second person. My only gripe is that one of the rods (Lower leading edge) snapped rather easily on my second day out with it. It's a $[...] part that they charge $[...] bucks to ship. Kind of a rip...."
492316,0,Bought this ball because I was sure it would hold my weight and it does im just afraid if I fill it too much it will pop so i dont belive mine is inflated properly. it does give clear instructions on how to fill. Ball is smaller then I expected. hand pump worked well did not take long at all to fill it. Have not yet watched dvd that it came with.

232679,2,I have returned four of these 12 cup perks and all four of them had a leak in the handle. Called the company and they said to return and to pay the return postage. That would have cost me more than the perk itself.
187670,1,"Have the same model bike at my second home and really like it, so bought this one for my permanent residence. I assembled it my self. It took me two weeks, but finally got it together. The front tire needs air frequently. Took the front fender off because I couldn't get it to not rub the tire and it rattled. I love riding this tricycle. It is a very pretty color."
22024,1,This gas cannot be found around my area. I order off of Amazon.com and found that the gas many years ago and is the best type that I have used. I completely recommend the use of 'green gas' it makes you weapon shoot well after continued use. This makes it an amazing product for this price.
465047,0,"The magazine is for a spring gun, so I was not expecting much. The magazine worked for a while, but managed to aquire BBs on the inside after a while and started to split open.

104991,1,"Florida living is one of being outside. Why stay inside to play cards & games in the gazebo, have coffee or tea with friends in the pergola or even as a serve yourself pool side. A bit of rain or pool water won't hurt this table and it wipes clean easily. Fold it away and it is always there where and when you need it. It will last a long time and if & when you get a newer one, this will work well in your potting shed or hobby work table. No end to its value in any home."
502699,0,"Product description says cards will be delivered in ""protective display album."" But they weren't. I received the cards in excellent condition, but they came lumped in a sandwich bag that was taped between two hard plastic plates, presumably to save the dealer on shipping costs, although there was a high shipping price attached to the item.Obviously, when one reads ""protective display album,"" one expects to see binder sheets with individual pockets. You can't ""display"" cards lumped together in a sandwich bag. Also, I'm no stickler about Mint condition, but once I remove the cards and put them in my own display sheets, their condition has degraded, even if slightly.The product is fine, and was delivered quickly, but given the high price of the cards and the shipping, having them delivered in a plastic bag, not the promised album, was disappointing."
64819,0,"This is the 3rd Razor A Kick Scooter that I have purchased, in as many years, so, obviously, I like the product. However, with this particular scooter ( I purchased two), the big attraction was the added features, of the bell and streamers. I was very disappointed that they were both cheap, and not very functional (streamers were as flimsy, as paper, and started shedding, right away,out of the box. The bell was no better...hard to make a ring, with the little plastic knocker, on the tiny little bell)...I would have preferred paying a little more, for quality, durable, functional, added features. I was very pleased with the color, since one girl wants pink, and the other purple, and this color satisfied both. Just, give us a better bell and sturdier, heavier plastic, streamers."

459654,2,"I had a previous model of this downrigger for many years before loosing it off of it's mounting while trailering my boat. The new 5 HS takes a bit of getting used to. First, it is really fast, maybe too fast. It is also noisy. The up and down switch is a problem if you want to raise the weight a few feet when trolling. Any up motion on the switch brings the weight all the way up until it clears the water. If you are trying to just raise the ball a little, it is easier to release the clutch and raise it up by manually turning the spool. It would be much easier if it were a 3 position switch like the older one. up is up, down is down, and the way-up position, brings the ball all the way up."
235500,0,"I love all of The Firm workout DVD's, however, this kit is a good kit, but not for me. This was a more physical workout tape and I had a problem keeping up with the sudden burst of speed. I was really looking more for a different kind of cardio workout DVD."

470098,0,"I coach HS football, and we were forced by the state this year to use the Wilson GST. The ball is very nice in use, great feel, good price, and works well if it isn't too wet. We also have some leather versions of this ball, and they work fine when wet.Unfortunately, the composite grip stuff isn't very long lasting. Despite the fact that we practice and play 90% of our games on grass and NEVER let the balls near cement or pavement, the new balls are wearing quickly, they look more beat up than last year's Spaldings that we used last year as game and practice balls, and still use for practice, and they are two years old. The Wilsons actually have worn the grip coating off at the seams and on the tips. The GOOD news is, it wears nice and even, it doesn't de-laminate and peel like the Nike Spiral Tech Composites did."
185489,0,"Not a fan of this pant, the waist fits too low and keeps rolling down! I hate that! The fit in the leg andlength is right on though. If they had more elastic in the waist or a drawstring they would be better. Noway can I wear these in my Jazzercise class - they would fall down!"
141238,0,"Received the product very promptly and in good condition. The box it was shipped in was really beat up and even creased... but, surprisingly the cue was unharmed. Supplier needs to put a little more effort into packaging. The cue is excellent. Great finish, great feel. I'm having trouble making the tip hold the chalk though. I've sanded the tip several times, but I guess it has too much varnish on the tip I guess? I'm nowhere NEAR being a professional pool player, so maybe I'm not doing something right?... I dunno.

325459,0,"The price is about right and it is the only set-up my kid seemed to like(as opposed to a rear mounted seat or trailer). Easy to load her in it.It was also easy enough to mount on a mountain bike, although i was skepticalat the one bolt that secured the seat to the cross bar mount, it seemedunsubstantial.Also, the straps could be easier to deal with, it would be greatif it also had foot straps.If i could get it to slide up another inch, i wouldn't have to alter my pedalingso my knees don't hit the back of the seat, though a slightly longer bike frame(or shorter legs) would solve that.In all, we are enjoying bike rides together."

I will be taking pictures and sending the package back. I will not be ordering pellets from them again. I have no problem with the price. JUST THE WAY THEY SHIP"
191126,1,"I've used this rolling backpack for a year now, so I can easily transport my teaching materials from one classroom to another. The bag can hold a huge amount of books and supplies. I love all of the zippered compartments and pockets. However, I have two complaints.1) When the backpack is full of books, the bottom front sags and drags on the ground. This causes holes over time. The company could probably have fixed this design flaw by reinforcing the cloth and leather there, or by placing a stiff plastic or metal piece along that edge to prevent the drooping in the first place.2) The handle has recently stopped retracting when you press the button on top. Instead, I have to bend down and press in the tiny metal bump on the side of the pole where the 2 poles meet, so the top pole can sink down into the lower one. Not a big deal, but still a little annoying.Overall, this was a great purchase. I'll just have to carry more books in my arms this year!"
444499,1,The most comfortable and generally not leaking at all! Ridiculously comfy and the vision is wide and great. Not the most competition looking... but that should not be seen as a weakness.
199551,1,Took me about 15 minutes to install. Works well. Get extra cable ties.
146352,0,"It really is a great product except 2 things:1. It is not self inflatable by any means - 5 minutes work of puffing, or more if you are in high altitude.2. I is quite big and not easy to find a place for it outside the backpack...But once it is inflated.... HEAVEN"
109105,2,"I was hoping it would not be made of potentially harmful material. Upon closer inspection of the packaging that the Sunshower comes in, it gives the disclaimer that the item is made of materials that have been found by the State of California to cause cancer.So, hey, it's really your choice. I just returned mine in the mail as soon as I read that. But I don't blame Stearns. All the portable showers are of the same PVC, no matter the brand.I think Kleen Kanteen needs to come up with a ""Kleen Shower,"" I'd buy it!"
469138,0,"The way the bike seat was structured is annoying because it doesn't hold in the seat very tightly so i had to keep re-screwing it in so I wouldn't bend the clamp holding it in place. Definitely okay for commuting but not really a ""racing"" type... Plus, my bike just got stolen and I wouldn't get this same one again."
67548,0,Well not bad for the Price BUT there are a couple of minor problems.First only one of the quick links was found in box.Second the threads on the Swing bolts has crappy plating and you will need to run a die over the threads.Note big pile of shavings after you do.I found this out as the first bolt broke. Not a happy camper here.Now I have to find replacement bolt and a quick link.But over all it is a good swing set kit.Once they fix the threads on the swing mounting bolts.
130014,0,"I have been a fan of the SureFire lights for a long time. I like the Streamlight products as well, especially for the price. After reading the reviews I thought I would give this one a try, just so I have a light that doesnt cost me $15 worth of lithium batteries every time the wife or kids get a hold of it and leave it on.The first annoyance I found was that this doesnt come with batteries! How silly is that! The lithium battery lights come with $15 worth of batteries, the LED lights come with batteries, why not this one? 3 C batteries only cost $3, why be stingy with this light and not the others?Now to the light. I could barely tell the difference between the two settings using the LED lights. Seemed pretty pointless after I used it a couple of times, they would have been better off just using the 3 or 6, not both. The regular light was disapointing. Not very bright when compared to the rest of the Streamlight or SureFire lights I have owned or used. It also had a ugly yellow color light and does not focus well, not the nice focused white light like most of the Streamlight products.I know this is a less expensive model than many of their lights, and much less expensive than the SureFire brand lights. But even taking that into consideration I am disapointed with this light.I would recomend the ""Streamlight 68202 ProPolymer 4AA Flashlight with 7 Ultra Bright White LEDs"" for $18 over this light. The LED setup works better, it comes with batteries and is much smaller and more manageable. For a ""bright"" light, I would go with the lithium battery type of Streamlight or preferebly the ""Streamlight 75014 Stinger Compact Rechargeable 15,000 Candlepower Flashlight"", it is much brighter, smaller, and rechargable.I am a fan of Streamlights products, this one just left too much that could have been improved."
210720,1,"After being in a terrible accident that broke my neck and fractured my eye socket (among other things), I ended up in physical therapy. First, the PT clinic at the hospital told me to use Leslie Sansone ""Walk Away the Pounds"" DVDs to gently rebuild my stamina. After getting me ambulatory, I then found a truly great PT sports therapy clinic where their philosophy is to strengthen the core first while at the same time using ultrasound and cranio-sacral therapy to alleviate the horrible pain.When I began there, I decided to get the Stott Pilates ring as a symbol of recovery. In the last month, I finally began to use it, also using Pilates exercises to strengthen my neck, shoulders, and of course my core.A warning to those who are quite strong or already very active -- this ring is for beginners only. You could easily snap it if you are strong already. That being said, it is a great device for beginners in Pilates, and not just people who have been injured. I use it at home daily doing the exercises and the Stott instructor at the sport physical therapy clinic has shown me modifications so that I can use it while doing exercises like the hundred, to further strengthen my core.Stott Pilates is a fantastic form of Pilates. They are willing to accommodate people who are in different circumstances, and the ring truly bolsters your strength, stamina, and coordination with its emphasis on form. I highly recommend this product to all beginners. I also strongly advocate that you use the ring and start Pilates ONLY under the personal instruction of a certified instructor. This applies to everyone, and you have probably heard it elsewhere, but Pilates requires proper form and proper breathing. If you do not even know how to ""imprint,"" then you will not be doing Pilates.The ring is an essential tool. It makes the workouts fun, and you can hold it between your legs to strengthen your abs, quads, and glutes while learning how to do a proper chin tuck before rolling your head, neck, and shoulders up off the floor. I take the ring wherever I go because it is easy to pack, lightweight, and a real workout tool that uses your own body weight as resistance. Get this ring -- you won't regret it."
438688,0,"It's a self-inflating mat...if it doesn't self-inflate, which I think we can all agree it does not, blow in it. Do you really need instructions for this? My mat did not self-inflate, but I blew into it and it actually turned out to be pretty good. It is way too narrow, but it holds the air and it's comfortable to lay on, so it's better than the two Eddie Bauer mats that I purchased last summer for almost twice the price."
395856,1,"I bought this jacket last year, and have been VERY pleased. It is wearable in most any type of weather. While put together, its thick, weather proof, with a unfoldable head-piece for wet weather. or lighter cold snaps, you can take out the liner and use either piece separately."
233675,1,"I was reccommended to purchase this product at a local feed store after coming home from the vet with my german shepherd. She had a large (grape sized) cyst on her neck and if she ever scratched she would rupture it. I was recommended a $300 surgery to have it removed. I was hesitant to purchase the Nu-Stock but I am SO GLAD I did! I've been applying it to the entire area (which was shaved) every 2 days or so for a month and a half, at first it only looked to be healing where she had previously scratched it so I quit using it a week or two, the cyst started to come back! I started back up with it and now the cyst is no more than a small scab on her neck, the product is drying it out and it is falling away! I'm very sure if I keep using it her problem with be gone completely and she will be a happy old girl again! If you get it for a problem similar to mine I suggest not giving up, Rome wasn't built in a night!"
74664,0,"It's a good carrier, but I hate having skis in my hand. Makes it tough to walk. I'm looking for one I can wear on my back."
383286,0,"Ok so I wont give this less than 3 stars, because it did last me around 9 months. I mean I still use it now, but it makes a horrible noise. At first it was great, but a few months in the black shavings started to come out from it somewhere, and I had to put a towel under the front when I used it because it was such a mess. In addition to this at high settings it made this horrible squeaking noise so I just lowered it which mean an easier exercise. Then it started to make the noise at lower settings, now if I used it, it is at a low setting and it makes the horrible noise. I will put up with the noise until I get a new bike. Overall if I went back I would have bought something else, but this wasnt completely useless."

467964,0,these are a verry well made pantie but a littel to much spandex and it not meant for every day use ore all day but it can be woren by ether a man or a woman
63257,1,The one I got isn't yellow and blue... it's all blue (which I like much better). It's sturdy! That means it's also heavy. My kids use it for gymnastics at home and for playing the Wii dance games... it helps to reduce stress on their feet jumping on our hardwood floors. Great product and worth the money.
475359,1,"This is a great backpack, durable and plenty of room for a whole days worth of books for classes and your laptop.The bone color is more of a off-white grey color, which i like.I love the pocket for my iPod and water bottle. It also has a nice zippered case for my computer doodads such as flash drives and other small items."
441732,0,"I had a Dean Markley sound hole pickup, which produced a hum when I turned up the volume. I thought this pickup (Seymour Duncan Hum-Canceling pickup) would be ideal for my needs. It does eliminate the hum, but the Dean Markley had better tone and volume at a lower setting. I use it regularly, but am actively looking for an upgrade."
405982,0,"I've had this knife for only a few days, and have already dumped it as my primary pocket knife. I'm left handed, and even though this knife is labeled as being ambidextrous, it really isn't. For one, the release switch is harder to operate with the left hand than the right. It's also harder to open with the left hand as opposed to right handed. Closing it is about the same either hand, but I feel more comfortable closing it with the right hand as opposed to left.I'm decidedly left handed, and this knife is way easier for me to use in my clumsy feeling right hand, and that's saying something. I suppose if I had to, I could train with this knife right handed until muscle memory kicked in and I was comfortable with it, but I'd rather use my dominant hand, the hand I've used for one handed knives for going on two dozen years.If you're right handed, it's an 5 star knife. If you're left handed, check out the Kershaw Asset Serrated Folding Lock Back Serrated Knife for a knife better suited for lefties."
462312,1,I've owned several seiko kinetic diving watches in the past and I was very impressed with the size and quality of this one. I'd heard reviews of similar older model Yema diving watches appearing too small when compared to Seiko's standard kinetic line but this particular model is amply large and very cool looking. Though it says Yema it feels like a Seiko (and apparently that's who manufactures them). Also initially I had an issue w/my order and I was taken care of right away and the retailer was very accommodating. An expensive looking watch at an affordable price--also comes with a beautiful case. Very nice...........
208548,0,"The shorts were smaller than expected. They JUST fit me, and the white ones are very see through. Im guessing another color other than white may be better"
389667,0,"The product is good, however it is not the mirrored silver as it appears to be in the picture. It is a dull gray color, which was fine for us."
224316,0,The material is thinner than the one I bought a few months ago and the color is just so so.
470522,2,"Save yourself the trouble and buy a two piece base. It looks terrible and makes it tough to clean. Amazon thinks I need to write more words here to complete the review, so I am."
160815,1,I am a collector a timepieces and have several timepieces that several thousand dollar and this timepiece in my opinion gives them a run for their money. It stands out and looks good with whatever your wearing and has plenty of flash. Ive received some many compliments on this particular timepiece that Ive lost count. All in all this watch gives you much more bang for your buck its worth. I am very satisfied with my purchased and with its shipping was like clock work it actually arrived a day ahead of what it was scheduled.

126660,0,"Although this is better and softer than my Schwinn stock seat, it's still pretty hard and makes me feel like I'm sitting on 2 lumps which is pretty annoying. After a bike ride with this seat my butt isn't sore in the usual spots like with my stock seat, but this seat still feels lumpy to me. Maybe I just need to wear it in...hopefully.Edit: It's a bit better but it takes a lot of adjusting. If the seat is tilted even a little bit too high or low, it's uncomfortable or you slide off it. When you get it right it's comfortable. I do indeed like it TONS more than my stock seat, I was just expecting it to be softer."
306430,2,"While the mat may be ok, that fact is I ordered a Gray mat and I received a Red Mat. It says Gray on the receipt and on my order. I am disappointed as I feel it's not worth sending it back. But I hope they read this and make sure it doesn't happen again!"
387288,1,"Bought this jump rope since the ""adult"" version was not available and almost twice the price. Both versions are used by people at my gym and both perform perfectly. I am 5'4"" and still needed to cut some length, so although it says ""junior"", it is sized for average adults. The more expensive version is not noticeably better. They both have the swivel action in the handles which I think is key to why this rope is better than any other you can buy."
315969,0,"The pants are well constructed, but built for giants. My husband is 5' 11"", we bought a size #7. I kid you not I had to remove 6"" and re-hem. Luckily, I am a seamstress, so no big deal, but if you are not crafty, you may need to reconsider these unless you are 6'5""."

240565,1,"Very good vest for daily socks. Tailoring and a fabric at the highest level. Has ordered two vests in black and gray color. The sizes have approached ideally. The lack of a black vest a label on the back party, it is shown outside and looks as a stain with glue. On a gray vest such isn't present. More remarks aren't present."
125359,1,Great skates. My daughter absolutely loves them. The only thing they seem to run at least half size smaller...
108051,0,"Cute helmet holder for a NY Giants fan family. Only 3 stars as there are 2 things missing: a drainage hole at the bottom so that water can get out and not collect in the bottom; secondly, the opening is not wide enough for a battery operated toothbrush so it doesnt fit in all the way."
459149,2,"The features of the watch are great, dual time was just what I was looking for since I am an ""analog"" guy. I'm old school so I tell time quickly by glancing at the hands but I use my watch as an alarm clock so like it's digital features.The bad part is the chrystal must be made out of some form of transparent cheese or really cheap soft plastic cause it has scratches and pock marks in it from which it should have withstood. I mean it wasn't abused but the lens just can't take much and it's a shame cause it is a great watch.The hands on the watch are adjusted with a forward and a reverse button and unfortunately the reverse button quit working in about 6 months from new.You see it is a great watch except for these shortcomings. I love the subtle blue face and it's features but I wish they would have put a little more quality in it's components."
468322,0,Good price but I won't to see more colors If you did I will buy more

334496,1,"To me, these knives are like socks in the dryer. Every so often I just lose one. But like socks, I use this knife daily. Not as a knife proper, but to pick on things, open this or that, fasten or tighten a screw. I finally learned not to use my teeth to rip on packages and find this knife in my pocket instead. The small jeans pocket. This should be a standard issue, everybody should have one and the TSA should lay off. Nobody is going to highjack a plane with this one."
445713,0,"I installed this antenna on a portable cd player, which admittedly is probably not the intended purpose for this antenna. The directions state that the antenna should be grounded, but because my cd player is portable I was forced to put the grounding wire to the negative post of whatever 12V battery I may be using at the time. Reception is poor, I get few stations and what I do get is a bit scratchy. I believe this antenna may require the use of another antenna (i.e. whatever it is being grounded to) in order to work. It gets 3 stars because it didn't work for my application, which is probably not the intended application."
494970,2,"The bottle looks nice and for the price, I just assumed it had a vacuum between an inner and outer wall (Thermos-style design) to keep the temperature in. Not at all! The aluminum wall of the bottle is one of the best conductors of heat, and the plastic liner inside the bottle is thin and does little as insulation. So I put cold water in the bottle and even add a couple of ice cubes, and the water still becomes room temperature before my son's soccer game is over. Other people have commented how you can put cold water in the bottle and the side of the bottle instantly becomes very cold, telling us that it has very little insulation. I'd rather pay for a good insulated (vacuum between a stainless inner and outer wall) bottle, but even many inexpensive plastic style water bottles are generally made with two walls and insulation in between the walls."

Well my wife decided to do it again and her buddy tennis instructor in another state told her to get one of these.It actually made a difference, because she could get enough practice in in a couple of hours a week of me pitching to her and her hitting or serving, to get good enough to play for the first time in her life.Now, a couple of months later, she is actually playing with 3 of her friends every week and doing pretty well. I am astonished.Get the Gamma ball hopper easy go wheels, to go on it, to make it easy to drag around. You'll want 4 or 2 with a separator. Glue the two halves of each wheel together."

482814,0,"This is a really nice knife, and I bought it after seeing all the great reviews. I ordered it at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and it was delivered to my door (up on a mountain) at 10:30 am the next morning (with Amazon Prime's $4 one-day shipping).Initially and for the next 3 or 4 days I was immensely pleased with it. It was extremely sharp, slick-looking, and the assisted open worked like a charm (even though I never used the speed safe... it seemed inconvenient.)However, on the 4th day, when I looked closely at the blade, I noticed that tiny spots of rust were forming on it. This is the reason for my 3-star review. The specs say it is stainless steel, and I have never had a knife rust that fast before. I had it only in my pocket and cut only a few things with it in these few days, and I see no reason for there to be rust forming under these normal conditions.I doubt the small amount of rain that got on it was acid rain, 1000 degrees fahrenheit, or anything like that. I have returned the knife for a refund."

I've used it to train for two marathons, a half marathon and a 12k trail run and couldn't be happier with the results. The watch didn't help me finish any of those races, but it did help me track my progress as I was training. I've never had any issues with the watch's mechanics or technology. I have a local jeweler replace the battery when needed and the watch is none the worse for wear."

501323,0,"I bought the Vetta because I had purchased one 15 years ago and it lasted this long and I was very happy with it. This one had everything I was looking for including cadence. However, I ignored some of the warnings of the difficulty in installing it. First, it comes with wires that will ONLY accommodate a front wheel installation. So, if you plan on using your bike on a trainer, you are out of luck. I found extension cables that allowed me to install the sensors on my rear wheel...however, when that arrived it didn't work. So, I ended up sending everything back."
193308,0,Dont buy this unless you already have good calouses on your fingers. Its all hard plastic with absolutely no padding at all.

However my fingertips on my right hand were too sore to use this after just one day
27642,0,"I'm a big fan of Citizen watches, but this isn't one of my favorites. The face looks nice, but the LCD is hard to read, especially on an angle. The LCD date/time digits are very small. The band is somewhat of a ""bracelet"" type, and doesn't work well on a small wrist. The mode selector stem feels kinda cheap. I do like the yellow second-hand, but it would have been so nice if it would have switched to being the chronograph second hand while chronograph mode is selected. Also, this watch has no way to retract the hands to 12:00 to get them out of the way of the LCD.However, one cool feature I haven't seen mentioned yet is the ability to make your own 3-letter timezone name and assign it any timezone (hour adjustable only). For example, if you lived in Sweden, instead of using ROM or PAR, you could create one called SWE.Having 3 alarms is great, but why doesn't anyone do something innovative, like say have one alarm repeat daily but only on weekdays and not weekends. Or make one of them be ""one-shot"" where it goes off once, but not every day. With 3 alarms, there should be more variety other than just different beep sounds.I find the dull gray color of the watch to be... dull. Titanium has a way of looking that way. However, newer designs by Citizen use Titanium in a much better way. Check out the ""Duratect DLC"" ones. It is a special processing done to the titanium to make it scratch resistant. It comes in black too."
112151,0,"Very nice just out of the box, but i wash it and put it on the dryer, came out with a little rip on the edge of the fabric, don't know what to think about this, maybe it was the regular cycle on the washing machine... other than that its pretty nice,it works!"

However, we quickly learned this item doesn't detect anything buried even just 1-2"" below ground, if it isn't literally just below the surface, it doesn't work.

339254,0,I purchased the pedometer for an upcoming hiking vacation and for overall use after the vacation. I took the instruction book along to adjust all the settings. I purchased the unit based on positive feedback and ratings. The unit works fine but WARNING the supplier I purchased from did not include a battery for the unit. I ended up on vacation ready to use it and adjust settings to find out after finding a small enough tool for the back screws that the unit was missing a battery. Totally out of luck and this was never mentioned in the description anywhere that batteries not included. Had to order batteries when I returned home. Real bummer !

I bought this for international travel because customs officials are notoriously fickle when it comes to knives. I'm headed to Scandinavia soon, and both assisted and locking knives are prohibited. No need to get my $225 Benchmade confiscated. As a weapon, the dagger of this would certainly punch through clothing and skin. Tried it in the garage, and it'll put a hole in drywall w/o problem. Will it punch through a leather coat? I dunno, but then neither will the bad guy. I'm recommending this item for the female college students on my trip, and I'm going to try some fine grain sandpaper on the tip.2/17Just bought another. Works well as a brush, and I have 3-5 female students who have bought one, too. They like it for walking across campus at night."

However, even though I ordered this knowing that there was no zipper, I expected the cocoon to close more snugly. However, when you close it up, the neoprene does creep up a bit, exposing the lantern to danger. A zipper, or some way to keep the cocoon closed would make this a 5 star item for sure."

Don't bother using the scope, since it points enough off of center that the target better be within 2 feet of the muzzle.Had bought another gun for another son who experienced the same type of shoddy workmanship and poor quality so the makers can't blame it on the child.

133000,0,"I bought the Sports Instruments PRO 9 Metal Heart Rate Monitor in the summer of 2006. I was very pleased with the apparent sturdiness and styling of this monitor, and the functions were quite useful for assessing the effectiveness my workouts. However, the battery has died. Normally I would change the battery myself, but I don't have the requisite tools. The manual recommends that ONLY a qualified Sports Instruments technician change the battery. This is deplorable. First, no list of technicians is provided and second, it will probably cost many times what I would normally pay to have a watch battery changed. I've requested to know the tool I would need to do this myself, as well as a list of ""qualified"" technicians from Sports Instruments but I am considering just taking it to a local jeweler. UPDATE of 01/31/2007. I took the monitor to a local jeweler and he told me he didn't have the necessary tool for opening the case. In addition, I just received this reply email from Sports Instruments: ""Dear Customer: It is the 1.5 mm hex key, I believe. I don't have a list of tech's in the area, but we suggest sending it back to us for repair as we can make sure it is done properly. The cost is $15. Please send to the address found on the product return form on the website and I can turn it around within 72 hours of receipt."" ---Just as I feared this repair will cost me more time and money than it should. (Notice the customer rep is not sure beyond a doubt what tool I would need to open the case but will only say he ""believes"" it is the 1.5 mm hex key.) Positively unacceptable!"
309720,0,"I bought this watch several years ago for use in my personal and professional life. I originally bought it for its simplicity, and water resistivity (200M). When first purchased I really liked the watch. I enjoy the simple look, the functionality and the durability of the watch. It has always kept great time.The downsides. I am a perfectionist when it comes to watches. When I first recieved the watch, the second hand did not, and never did match up exactely the markings on the dial. Secondly, there was some ""wiggle"" room of the bezel against the case of the watch. This does not affect the fuction of the watch, but as I am a perfectionist, this displeased me. Finally, after 3 years of repeatedly adjusting the date of the watch from month to month, the threads on the screw down crown stripped, leaving the watch.. less than water resistant.I guess in the long run, I would have spend some additional money and purchased a watch of higher quality overall, like the Victorinox Divemaster 500M Chronograph i just purchased.I hope this helps!"
301235,0,"This watch looks great and is from a great Japanese watch brand. However, the movement is made in Malaysia, and that could have something to do with the watch being about 1/2 minute fast per day.

I checked for punctures and found none, I then did a water test looking for a pin hole leak and found none. I now suspect that the problem is a seam or at the air pump connector. I called the manufacturer and they advised me that they do not warrant air mattresses and suggested that I contact the seller, Amazon. I called Amazon to see if I could get an exchange or a refund and was advised that the return date for this item expired on March 2011, 30 days after purchase and that I was not entitled to an exchange or a refund even if the item was defectively manufactured.Intex Prestige Downy Twin Airbed Kit"

140309,0,I bought this game as I wanted a great workout that was fun for the Wii. I was looking forward to it considering it had sports like the inline skating and the boxing. But my biggest problem with this game is it does not allow you time to grab the resistance band or put the numchuck in the pocket. It goes from one workout to another without allowing you time to set your controllers down and pick up the band or put the numchuck in the pocket. Also one thing I don't like is that strap for the band around your thigh is huge and keeps wanting to slip down my leg. The trainers think you are not doing the movements when in turn you are trying to adjust the strap or pick up the resistance band. All in all it would be a great workout and you would get great results but it is just too complicated with all the tools you need for it. Less is more when it comes to this workout.

165191,2,"The idea of a teeny, keyring-sized Leatherman is great! I snapped one up right away and started sticking it in my pocket for all those little handy problems that come up when you're far away from any regular tools (or even a larger multi-tool).You know, like performing a quick tracheotomy on the bus. Or defusing a thermonuclear device someone found in a storage closet. Or trying to survive after a plane wreck on an island.Ok, more like opening the case on a PC to add a sound card, trimming a hang nail, opening a bottle of beer, or opening a shrink-wrapped CD.Well the idea was a great one, but I found the size of this tool too small to work with the flip-open Leatherman approach. The blade is too small for cutting most stuff, the pliers can't generate enough torque, and the tool selection too limited. Worst of all (and this is a problem I've had with other Leatherman products, though not some of their competition) its tricky to extract the right tool and I scraped up my finger tips several times catching them on the knife blade or sharp edges of the tool.So its a great idea but doesn't quite work. I'd say, if small size is key, go for one of the more pocket-knife-like products. If features are key, it might be worth accepting a bit more bulk and getting one of the mid-sized pocket tools."

269257,1,"Overall not a bad bike, it doesn't weigh a brick ton, has decent components, and was easy to assemble. A basic working knowledge of bikes is essential to getting the most out of this bike, the brakes need a little fine tuning ( depending on your preferences for how sensitive the brakes are,) but the d&eacute;railleurs were set up pretty well. The saddle is pretty uncomforable for how much it weighs, but there are plenty of aftermarket saddles available. The only required upgrade (IMHO) is some clipless pedals. They are way lighter and offer better performance. The bike isn't the best handling bike, but it does ride pretty well, and does whatever I ask of it. It isn't the quickest, but for the money I would probably buy another one."

141902,0,"I believe these are decent rings at a decent price here on Amazon, HOWEVER:(Disregard this post if you are looking for see-through ring mounts as the following post does not apply.)I am not a ""gun expert"", but this might be helpful information if your not familiar with scopes and rings, etc. Please confirm this for yourself, because I could be wrong.A part number on this item might help a lot. This is a pretty good quality item (esp. for rim fire rifles) and good manufacturer in general, however these look like LOW rings which may be good for Objective Lens sizes under 30 MM size (definitely under 40mm) and would probably work well with an old-style straight 1"" tube scope.(Note: The Objective Lens is NOT the end you look into.)Low height rings maybe may work with Objective Lens under 30MM in Dia.Medium maybe works with Lens around 30-40MMHigh maybe works with 50 MM or larger.Millet has rings specifically numbered and specified for different firearms (see part numbers below).This is all a guess, BECAUSE IT DEPENDS on other factors:The mount and ring height ""partly determines"" the clearance between the bottom of the Objective lens to the firearm barrel. Ring height may also be influenced by the firearm dimensions: the height from the top of the receiver (or the mounting base with a weaver / picatiny rail) down to the high point of the barrel at the receiver. (The ""height"" refers to the ""up and down"", ""vertical"", or ""Z"" dimension).Millet Detachable Mounts - general published height dimensions (height measured from top of weaver rail to bottom of 1"" tube of scope) are as follows:Low .115Med .220High .470For example, say your were looking for rings to mount a Meuller 4.5-14x40MM AO 1"" tube Silver Scope on a Ruger 10/22 Carbine (Standard .820 barrel). See [...] for scope dimensions. Say the 10/22 has a standard Weaver style rail mounted on the top of the receiver, which adds no height to the base of the rings up off the top of the receiver.The objective bell of the Mueller scope is 2.07"" in dia. (O.D.), so we take half of that, which is 1.035"" minus half of the 1.0"" O.D. scope tube (that will be in the ring)or 1.035-.5=.535 which gives us the difference from the bottom of the scope tube to the bottom of the Objective Lens Bell. So .535"" is the height we need to be clear of, as measured from the bottom of the 1"" tube. So... The approximate drop in height from the top-of-the-Weaver-rail (mounted on the receiver of the 10/22) to the section of the barrel where the Object Bell will be hovering over is about 3/8"" (or .375). (Note: Remember most barrels are tapered, and consider possible interference with fixed sights too, if present.) The offset of the Millet Medium height ring from the top-of-the-Weaver-rail up to the bottom of the scope tube is published as .220"". So, .220+.375=.595"" offset giving us a clearance of .595-.535=.075"" (a very close clearance at under 1/16""). So if the calculations are correct, the LOW Millet ring would never work, as the medium ring just makes it by a few hairs. Also consider that the small clearance with the Millet Medium Height Rings and this particular scope example might make it difficult, if not impossible, to use a front lens cover.I believe we would require a medium or high set of rings to keep the 40MM lens from interfering with the top of the barrel. (so one might choose: Millett Part# DT00908, which is called: "" 1"" Medium Silver .22 Cal Detachable, Clam"" -- see part numbers below). The High Millet rings would increase the clearance (or gap between the scope Objective Lens Bell and Barrel)) by another 1/4"", which might be something to consider with this example Mueller 40mm Objective Bell, especially if you ever wanted to put caps over the end s of the scope.Without the part number included in the listing above, one can only guess it is the LOW height model from the item photo and other buyer's comments, who said it was not high enough and did not work for his scope(ibid).It also might depend on where the shooter's normal repeatable cheek weld on the stock of the rifle puts their eye or where the shooter feels comfortable. Many people do not like see-through rings because of this, because it puts the scope too high to get a normal cheek weld.There are also some posts online for different scopes and firearms (blogs, youtube, manufacturers websites, etc.) to refer to. If someone has the scope and rifle in hand, they can measure them and try to obtain some dimensions online for the rings. People can also reach out to a gunsmith and ask about their specific combination of gear, as not to blow more dollars on a useless new item (some rings can cost more than some scopes).Good Luck, I hope this post helps someone.Some good online posts I have found regarding scope ring sizing:[...] [...]Millett Part Numbers:Millett AL00019 1"" Medium Bright Aluminum Vertical Split, ClamMillett AL00020 30mm Medium Bright Aluminum Vertical Split, ClamMillett AL00719 1"" Medium Matte Aluminum Vertical Split, ClamMillett AL00720 30mm Medium Matte Aluminum Vertical Split, ClamMillett AL00919 1"" Medium Silver Aluminum Vertical Split, ClamMillett BB00715 Matte Browning, A-Bolt Two Piece Base, ClamMillett BB00716 Matte Browning, BLR,BAR Two Piece Base, ClamMillett CP40702 1"" Medium- Alum Matte Remington 700 Series, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40704 1"" Medium- Alum Matte Remington 7400, Sig AMT, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40706 1"" Medium- Alum Matte Marlin, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40708 1"" Medium- Alum Matte Savage 110, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40712 1"" Medium- Alum Matte Browning A-Bolt, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40714 1"" Medium- Alum Matte Browing BAR,BLR, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40716 1"" Medium- Alum Matte FN Mauser, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40718 1"" Medium Matte CVA Octagon, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40726 1"" Medium- Alum Matte Ruger 10/22, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40728 1"" Medium- Alum Matte Remington 740, 42, 60, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40730 1"" Medium- Alum Matte Winchester 70, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40912 1"" Medium- Alum Silver Browning A-Bolt, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40918 1"" Medium Silver CVA Octagon, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40922 1"" Medium Silver Knight MK-85, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40924 1"" Medium Silver Knight Wolverine, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40925 1"" Medium- Silver Remington 700 Series, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CP40930 1"" Medium Silver Winchester 70, Combo Base & Rings, Detachable, ClamMillett CV00702 Matte CVA, Traditions, Round Receiver Two Piece Base, ClamMillett CV00901 Silver CVA, Traditions, Octagon Two Piece Base, ClamMillett CV00902 Silver CVA, Traditions, Round Receiver Two Piece Base, ClamMillett DT00001 1"" Low Bright Detachable, ClamMillett DT00002 1"" Medium Bright Detachable, ClamMillett DT00003 1"" High Bright Detachable, ClamMillett DT00701 1"" Low Matte Detachable, ClamMillett DT00703 1"" High Matte Detachable, ClamMillett DT00704 30mm Low Matte Detachable, ClamMillett DT00705 30mm Medium Matte Detachable, ClamMillett DT00706 30mm High Matte Detachable, ClamMillett DT00708 22 Cal Medium Matte Detachable, ClamMillett DT00709 22 Cal High Matte Detachable, ClamMillett DT00901 1"" Low Silver Detachable, ClamMillett DT00902 1"" Medium Silver Detachable, ClamMillett DT00903 1"" High Silver Detachable, ClamMillett DT00908 1"" Medium Silver .22 Cal Detachable, ClamMillett DT00909 1"" High Silver .22 Cal Detachable, ClamMillett FN00705 Matte FN Mauser Series, Interarms Mark X Two Piece Base, ClamMillett KN00902 Silver Knight, Wolverine Two Piece Base, ClamMillett MB00708 Matte Marlin 336,30AS Series One Piece Base, ClamMillett RB00707 Matte Remington 7400, 7600, 4 , 6 One Piece Base, ClamMillett RB00708 Matte Remington 740, 742, 760, SAV170 One Piece Base, ClamMillett RU00701 Matte Ruger 10/22 One Piece Base, ClamMillett SB00710 Matte Savage 110 Two Piece Base, ClamMillett SB00711 Matte Savage 110 Accutrigger Two Piece Base, ClamMillett SB70710 Matte Remington, 700 Series Two Piece Base, ClamMillett SB70910 Silver Remington, 700 Series Two Piece Base, ClamMillett TP00010 30mm Medium Bright .22 Caliber Aluminum Vertical Split, ClamMillett TP00709 1"" Medium Matte .22 Caliber Aluminum Vertical Split, ClamMillett TP00710 30mm Medium Matte .22 Caliber Aluminum Vertical Split, ClamMillett TP00909 1"" Medium Silver .22 Caliber Aluminum Vertical Split, ClamMillett WB70706 Matte Winchester & Marlin MR-7, 70 Series Two Piece Base, ClamMillett BB01002 Smooth Browning, X-Bolt Two Piece Base, ClamMillett BB01702 Matte Browning, X-Bolt Two Piece Base, Clam"

I ended up with quite a large puddle inside the tent after a heavy rain storm. Make sure you take the time to water proof it. The head room wasn't bad, but not as good as my old Coleman cabin. You need to be in the center of the tent if your tall (I'm 6'3""). The shoe pocket is a nice idea, but it would be better placed on the other side of the door, closest to the zipper. There doesn't seem to be much available in the way of cabin tents in this size range, which is how I ended up getting this one. Once it's properly water proofed, I'm sure it will meet my needs."
359317,0,"Ahhh Tiger Woods, I have never watched him play but I have watched myself play AS him. My grandfather and I started playing this game in 97 I think. The game has gotten a lot bigger and a lot better looking since then. I really like 08 but there are some things I hate. These few things are big enough to bother a lot of people. I will tell you everything I like and everything I did not.ProsThis game a great looking. While graphics don't mean that much to me, it is still nice to have a good playing game look so great. The controls are very clean. I was worried about the putting because I didn't like 06 mainly for the putting controls. They put back the line showing you how the ball will go. Putting will take a little bit to get used to but when you do it will be very easy and you will probably like it a lot more than 07. There are a lot of different things to do in this game. I have not even gotten to do them all yet. I have been spending time playing the career mode. It is very fun and actually challenging when you first start playing with the player you make. If you liked previous Tiger woods games, you will more than likely enjoy this years as well. You may even like this game if you did not like the ones before it. This game also has a new thing called Photo Game Face. This is a really cool new thing that allows you to take a picture of your face in front and side view, then you upload the pictures to the internet. EA Sports World dot com. You then download the picture onto your Xbox 360 and put it on a golfer. After this is done you can make your golfer look however you want. You can change the body size and shape., the hair, the clothes and everything else. It makes doing well with your character that much better being you. You can make like 10 characters. You can not play with them all during the same game which is something I will talk about later in the cons. As I said I have not done everything on this game yet but being as the first thing I did was this much fun I can only guess the rest will be just as fun.ConsNow for the few things I did not like about the game. Again these few things bothered me enough to almost make me sell the game. First let me talk about making this game personal. Well there are a lot of things you can do to make it just the way you like it. For example you can change the swing or the stance of your golfer. The big thing I like to change is the controls. I can not, for the life of me, use the left analog stick to hit. I have been using the right stick since I can remember. Now your probably saying ""well how is this a con?"" The problem is that you can only change any and all of the personal things, when your online! This isn't bad at all for me because I have a wireless adapter and a wireless router in my home. The problem with this though is my grandfather has fiber optic. I have not been able to set up a connection at his house. I think I finally got it working one day but then he (who has always used the left analog stick as compared to my using the right) had to use the right stick. Since I had my character set up to use the right. Everyone that played with me at his house, had to use the control scheme I set for my own golfer. This made it hard for my grandfather and uncle to enjoy or even play the game. Don't let this miss lead you. They can make there own golfer and set up the controls which ever way they choose but there is only one way to do so. They must play with there own character. As you read before in my pros, you can set up more than one golfer. You can not play with more than one at the same time however. The only way for each person to play with there own, personal, self made character. Is for each person to have there own xbox live account. My uncle wouldn't pay for it because he doesn't own an xbox. My grandfather is retired and likes to save his and my grandmothers money for important things. So unless all the people who wish to make the game personal, and play together with you, wish to pay 50 dollars for an online account. They can not make the game the way they want. It is like you buy the game, but unless you buy xbox live your just renting it. This reminded me of the iPhone and AT&T.; Apple makes you use them even though they are like the loest ranked service around. When I found this out it made me so angry. Now even if he picks his golfer from the roster that is in the game. I have to either struggle to play with a control scheme I have never been able to do, or if somehow I finally get online and can get the controls the way I like. He has to play with my control scheme. Which he can not do.So what it all comes down to is this. Tiger woods is a great game in many important ways. I is a blast to play and seeing your character build up his stats and get better makes you feel great. The online factor is very fun and it makes you feel good winning against another person. But there are things that should be looked at before the next Woods game is released. The way I see it is. If you have already payed for xbox live. You should be able to have as many people play with you at a time as you wish. Let Microsoft not let anyone play online whom doesn't have there own xbox live account. But don't stop people from playing with there friends and family in there own home."
18658,0,I am using it almost daily and it is performing well. The only thing I will mention is that my previous jogger (which I cannot find) was widerander and fitted better so it stayed in place and did not try to ride up in deep[ water.The jogger was purchased at Amazon.
91667,2,"I ordered this to hold up my banana seat on a retro-look motorized bike I'm building.Due to not being able to adequately being able to tighten the clamps to the bar no matter how tight I could get the clamps...had nothing but issues with not being able to ride my bike. As long as this type of sissy bar is not being used to support any type of weight and for decoration only...you will have no problems. Because of this...ended up finding a less expensive 42 inch sissy made to fit a beach cruiser frame and bolt to the axle of the rear wheel. This ended the issue of the ""adjustable"" seat while being used. Plus...was able to bend that new sissy bar to an almost 45 degree angle for an even more funky look.In addition...you are on your own to locate the bolts and nuts to hook the clamps to the bike. Would have been nice to have included 50 cent bolts and nuts to install to your bike."
493614,0,"I was kicking around picking up Cold Steel Kukri machete when this guy showed up including a sheath. I went over to You Tube to check out any reviews, found 2, and went for it. It's OK!Guys are afraid of 440 stainless, but 440c is an acceptable knife steel, and can be quite tough when properly heat treated. I chopped up a small junker tree out back and batoned through a bunch of firewood and the blade held up fine. Couple licks on a steel and it was right back where it started. Factory edge is to abrupt and honed only so-so, but it's a chopper so it's good enough.Finish was applied evenly and held up good through use. Handle is comfortable shape/material. Slight wiggle in handle to tang fit, seems to be getting worse under use, so fit gets a solid D+. I'd buy this thing again, and I'm considering another Smith and Wesson big blade because I'm very happy with the cost/performance ratio. Go ahead and buy it."

47616,0,Other than the fact it smells horrible - it performs well and rolls up neatly for storage. It has velcro straps that keep it secure. The mat is very thick and doesn't move/slide around to much while using it. It's great for situps and just about any other activity you'd be on the ground for.Update - I just can't get over the smell of this thing. I've used it/washed it/let it bake in the sun/hung in the wind and it still smells like death... I live in a dorm and I just can't escape the smell. I store it in three trash bags and you can still smell it. Threw it in the trash today - just couldn't take it anymore.

313069,1,"I've been using the bodylastics for about two weeks and i'm blown away that a product that is so simple and inexpensive can be so effective.I'm 54 years old and have been working out regularly for 25 years. I have a complete set of free weights and a weight stack home gym. this simple product can duplicate almost every exercise as well as my heavy, expensive equiptment.In a number of areas bodylastics are superior. The potential for injury is much less and it is easier and faster to switch between exercises. Finally, the best exercise is the one you actually do on a regular basis. I enjoy the bodylastic work out much more than using my old equiptment- I'm getting addicted and can already feel better muscle tone than i was able to achieved before. These bands will work your muscles every bit as much as a weight set- i'm sore after every session.The DVD that comes with the set is ok for a beginner but if you search the web you can find some sites with better info.Look on ebay- you'll find endless listings for bowflexes and total gyms that are being dumped after collecting dust from non use. You won't find anyone selling a used bodylastic set."
289532,1,"So when is my Precip lime colored jacket gonna wear out? Never. I have had it for a few years and no excuse to buy a new one but, I just love it so much that I wanted it also in brown. I mean I have taken this jacket around the world through backpacking, backcountry skiing, rafting trips, you name it and it is an amazing jacket. Layer under it and you can use it year round which I do. I am always dry in this jacket even in a long downpour hike, ski, raft... I am dry. The pit zips are awesome and easy to open and close on the move and I love the cut. I feel like a woman not some guy with a straight jacket on that does not fit my hips. You ladies know what i mean, right? I have a figure... this jacket shows it. Oh, and not to mention, it washes well and dries quick. I cannot say enough and if i could substantiate it in every color for every day of the week, I would have one for every day of the week. But, I already have two now. Maybe in three years marmot will keep this jacket on the retail options and I can get yet another color. So buy the jacket. It is a steal for the uses, value and overall performance of course."
265301,1,"Overall, this is a good knee pad. It stays in place as well as can be expected given my use in the martial arts.Go to the Cliff Keen website to find the sizing charts.

303237,2,"At the beginning of the summer I made a commitment: I would work my way through the P90X DVD set that so many people have praised.Now that I'm finished, overall, I have to say that I found it a disappointment: the plot was repetitive, the dialogue was unconvincing, I never got a sense of any kind of character arc, and they needed a ton of ""padding"" to stretch this story to 12 DVDs -- they easily could have told it in 2 hours (1 disc). With a name like P90X, I expected a taut, futuristic, military techno-thriller; instead, it centered around a guy in a room encouraging people to dance like him -- not very interesting.Furthermore, the setting never changed: if you're going to confine the action to one set, next time consider doing it as a *play* instead of a TV mini series."
355919,1,"Comfortable, large enough for one person. Rolls up around you when you're in it but I prefer that in a single person hammock for the stability. I'm sure it won't last forever, but I'd be happy to get several years out of it for the price."

The provided Belt adjustments keeps the holster from slipping on your belt.

This is an excellent product that works for any holster as long as Blackhawk makes one for your pistol."
509979,0,"Yes, it's true. The Viscaria is a very technologically advanced Table Tennis bat. The blade itself is very supple and very well-constructed to be lightweight and not top heavy. The Bryce rubber is of course world-class rubber that professionals use at the top of the line. However, if you are honestly at the level where you think you need to use Bryce rubber, go have a bat custom-made. There are countless websites that give you selections of rubber, blades, and they'll even attach them for you.I got a bat almost exactly like this, except with a better backhand rubber, all for about half the price. At this level of Table Tennis, it's best to forge your own."

86760,1,"I have used this knife for about a year here in the middle east. Great knife, holds an edge real well. I like the light handle (some people have told me they like heavier handles) but I prefer the lightweight material. One of the reasons I purchased this knife is the cutout feature in the handle for cutting fishing line or small strands of rope, but I have to date not used it. Also, I play with the opening mechanism a lot when im bored, and the arch lock mechanism has become slightly weak from overuse. I have to pull it farther down to close the blade, and it doesnt feel all that fluid anymore. Overall, I think the knife is worth the money. Id go with the black Tini coating, and I prefer straight blades as opposed to serrated. That is why I went with the Tanto blade, and it is much thicker than the other option. Overall, a great knife."

99840,0,"Prompt delivery of my Mio Sport Select Heart Rate Watch. Unfortunately, the watch arrived immediately needing a battery replacement. I had no problems getting a replacement battery. The watch was packaged with a 1-page instruction sheet and two other inserts (one with their customer service info; one with replacement wristband info) so the customer service number was easy to find. The customer service rep I got on the phone was very courteous. Mio outsources its repairs so I sent the watch with a letter directly to the repair center. The watch returned with a new battery w/in 2 weeks. I've been wearing this watch to the gym and use it to take my heart rate during my cardio kickboxing classes. Sometimes the reading displays quickly, but other times it takes me awhile. It is supposed to tell me how many calories has been burned; however, I haven't been able to figure that feature out quickly enough and the 1-page sheet of directions doesn't quite cover that. I'll have to visit the MIO website and watch their product demonstration video. I hope the watch lasts; however, should I ever need it replaced, I'll probably try another brand - perhaps Polar - the pioneers of heart monitoring devices. I'll also opt for a more feminine style. This one is too big for my wrist, but I couldn't turn down the low price Amazon was offering (lower than $30)."

502260,2,"Ordered this for my Yankees themed audio room. Do not buy this! Poor quality. The plastic case was made of cheap mdf board, where the edging was routered for the protective top to fit the ""wood"" was left unstained, and the router line was uneven so the case top looked even worse when rested in the wobbly recessed routered line. The stadium was very undetailed and basic. The signs and flags were a poor combination of being poorly glued on and/or just plain stick on stickers that were coming undone. The painting of the fans was the quality of what my young daughter would do. Bottom line - whole item was worth maybe $20. Cheap chinese junk that the importer should be made to take the loss on. I will not accept it and returned it to Amazon.Oh, and one last detail, the boxes the stadium and cover are shipped in are as cheap as the stadium. During the shipping process they broke apart (the outside shipping box was not damaged) and the stadium was damaged and the cover cracked. Back to China with this junk!"

432436,1,"I wavered between giving these three stars or four stars.Pros: They are light, they condense well, they are not teflon (I avoid teflon because of research showing subtoxic effects of teflon), food cooks fast, and are inexpensive.Cons: I used these pots with a Coleman Gas stove and after the first time using it, the bottom of the pots warped and both the inside and outside of the pot became discolored. I was boiling water for pasta in one pot and making sauce in the other pot. I was disappointed because I felt that they should be a bit more durable. That being said, they still seem to function fine and I have used them since. I don't know if they will last as long as I was hoping.I guess overall they are good. They are inexpensive and light, but don't seem very durable. If you need something quick and cheap, these might be the right pots."

314789,1,"Purchased the gray version of this bed online about a week ago. Took me about 3 minutes to unpack and about 7 to inflate both sections. Fits together well and held air pressure for 4 hours with no signs of leakage. Packaging was nice and the current version comes with 2 oversize duffles with more than enough room for a properly deflated mattress. Several older customer reviews indicated their was not enough room in the bag to fit both mattresses and pump, Intex seems to have addressed this concern. The 3-way air valve on the bed frame is good. Direct connection to air pump really speeds filling, has a check valve so if the pump dislodges you don't lose the air you put in and basic deflation is as easy as squeezing a clip and the whole valve pops out. 90% of the air leaves in seconds. Smaller nozzles on both 2 and 3 way valves made smaller pressure adjustments to suit comfort pretty easy as well. The whole thing is flocked for a ""fabric feel"" and placed together it actually holds the sheets in-place; however, they did not flock the inside bottom of the bed frame making the use of it as a second mattress (for more guests) less appealing than the packaging implied. The actual deflation went OK except the air pump would not pull air out of the bed frame (because it cannot override the check valve) and the tolerances on the bed valve cap are tight making the air pump difficult to connect to completely deflate. It took about twice as long to put away as setup. Overall a good value if you are looking for a versatile airbed with the added benefit of standard sheets staying in-place."

The thing is as loud as a leaf blower if not louder. I am sure my neighbors now hate my guts. I actually took it inside to kind of minimize the noise level. I do not think you really need ear plugs and such but if you have low tolerance for noise, THIS IS NOT for you. Otherwise it worked great for me."

22919,0,"So I bought these for our multi day backpacking excursions because they wick well, and supposedly resist odors. They feel super comfortable with the exception that they creep up my ashnitz more than normal boxer briefs. They prevent chafing, and breath well. As far as preventing odor, not a chance. Like all polyester/plastic clothing, they seem to reek at the end of the day of normal activity. My standard cotton boxers smell way better after a long day of hiking. Hype sells, but I call bullisht on the odor prevention."
100902,2,"I am a road cyclist. It is helpful to know a few things about a given ride: the distance, the speeds, and the total cumulative ascent. The total cumulative ascent (TCA) is the summation of the hill climbs for that day. For example, a ride of 100 miles on the flat is a whole lot easier than one of 10,000 feet TCA. I had a Casio watch which readily gave the TCA in 1998, unfortunately it was lost in Italy. I called Casio prior to purchase of a new one and was told that the Casio Pathfinder PAG40B would do the job. The watch does graph the altitude. However, after hours of trying to obtain the TCA using the instruction manual and a phone call to Casio it would appear it cannot be done. It is a shame; it is a good watch otherwise."
266315,0,"Please don't take this as a negative review of the product, it is not. The product itself is what it advertises it is. The strap from the holster to the calve support could be longer or adjustable.

Without the support strap the firearm slides down all day, it would be great for a short seat time period however wearing daily without that support at least for me is out of the question.

Then I tried using the stopwatch timer function, and that is not working either.I thought maybe it's the battery, since the one they give you with it is a generic-looking one, but even putting in a brand-new known brand C cell doesn't help. One thing I noticed when I replaced the battery is that I get a high pitched static sound for about 5 seconds, then it goes away. I don't recall that happening the first time I put the battery in.Anyway, I stupidly threw away the box it came in so I now have to send it back to Accusplit instead of returning to Amazon. I called the support number to see if there was any thing else I could try, and although the gentleman I spoke to was nice he didn't even try to help. He just immediately gave me the address to send it back to.I will update this review once I get my clock back from Accusplit.As of now I'm very disappointed that it didn't even last a month."

It does the job and seems to be a good value for the money, but it definately is not a performance rower.PROS:CheapCompactFolds EasilySimple Digital Display lasts a very long time one one batteryCONS:No chain, the pull mechanism is a strap of fabric.Plastic wheels support the seat and pull movement. Mine have note worn out yet but they're not that smooth and they do feel as if they have worn down significantly during the year that I have used my rower.The pull movement creates no momentum as with a fan or water resisting model, so you really cant build up much inertia and each pull feels like you're starting from a stp, which is not mych like real rowing.All in all it's a good unit but if you're looking for something that will really take a beating and last a long time and also emulate the feel of rowing much better, get a concept 2 model D or E. I wish i had spent the extra $400 at the time, because now I have to sell my current rower first. Interested?"

169159,0,"I bought this bike to donate to a benefit for a sick child in our neighborhood, and so when it was delivered we left it until 2 weeks from the benefit to assemble, hoping to keep it shiny and new until delivery. Unfortunately, like the case of another reviewer, we found that the front fork was too narrow for installation of the wheel, and it was missing a kick stand and a set of pegs.I immediately wrote to Amazon, as out return window (30 days post receipt) expired 2 weeks before, asking them to allow us to return it and also asking them to ship us another right away so that we could make our deadline. The other reviewer seemed to have had better luck than we did. They did make an exception to the return policy, but my only option for replacement was to order another bike and pay for expedited shipping, which I have done.The order process did not include a way to ask them to check the fork before they ship, and to inspect to make sure all the part were there. I did write back to customer service asking them to forward the request to anyone that could help, because if it happened a 2nd time (as it did with the other reviewer), we would have no time left to deal with this before the benefit.Before re-ordering we did call the manufacturer to see if we could deal directly with them, but apparently this is a discontinued model, and they have no parts to send us.I am hoping that everything comes in this shipment, and am expecting the quality to be that described by the other customers. But I think it's important to let other people know that this bike seems to have inventory problems inside Amazon, and it is no longer has manufacturer support. And also - if you order one - open and inspect immediately as sports equipment is limited to a 30 day return window.The bike did have strong parts, and looked very nice when we tried to assemble. But since you can't use it without a wheel, 3 stars is the best I can do."

7464,0,"considering this is an entry level electric airsoft gun i think you would be more happy with a spring gun for the same price. this gun is mostly plastic, which means it will break easily (depending on how much and where you use it) also it has low fps and range. when i got this gun it worked ok the first couple times i played with it, but eventually (even with a new battery) the bb's just fell out of the barrel. another thing about it is that you can only fire full automatic and trying semi (holding the trigger half way) will not work. a spring gun for a similar price will have better fps, range, and accuracy. plus you dont need to charge a spring gun."

401437,2,"At one time, you just needed to see the Everlast brand name to be assured that you were getting a top-quality product: one that would withstand anything you could throw at it.Now that they've outsourced their manufacturing to China, Everlast quality is not the virtual guarantee that it once was.I purchased (and use) these wraps. However, one of them was manufactured improperly. The velcro closure is sewn to a different side of the wrap than it is on all the others. Because of this, I always ended up putting it on backwards. I finally marked it so I would know to put it on differently than the others.For around $10, you should expect to get something that has passed a quality-control check. After all, wraps are just some strips of cloth and velcro; they probably cost about $0.25 to manufacture.These wraps are short, just over 100 inches, but fine for hitting the bag. They are not elasticized, but that is fine for my purposes, as it's what I prefer. If you want to do serious sparring or fighting, or if you want to put some padding on your knuckles (under the wraps), you'll need longer wraps than these. In short: you can wrap your wrist, knuckles, and thumb with these, but you won't have enough material to wrap between your fingers. They come packed in a plastic mesh bag, but it can't easily be reused. A cloth mesh bag with a drawstring would have been better.Summary: overpriced and shoddily-made."
75021,1,"I have caught more fish, and more variety of fish with this rig than any other fishing method/rig/lure. It simply consists of a sturdy monofilament line, a swivel, a spacer ball, a blade harness, a blade (I prefer red or red and white), and a hook. Baited with a minnow, a worm (crawler), or a leach, I have caught northern pike, walleye, crappie, sunfish, perch, and bass. The only complaint I have with the rig is the swivel is rather cheap. I tie on a more reliable swivel to prevent line twisting. This rig can be casted, but works best with trolling. I use a 1/4 or 3/8th slip sinker weight above the swivel. It catches fish! If all I could have in my tackle box was one rig/lure, this is the one I'd have.Now I've given away my best fishing secret! Hope you have as much success as I have!konedog"

617,1,"This air bed is great for the price. The built-in pump allows you to add air easily. I found that if I use it more than a couple nights in a row, I needed to add air, but it was very convenient with the built-in pump. The pump is noisy, but that is to be expected. Twin sheets fit well. The top is quite bumpy when fully inflated, so you can let some air out, or add a mattress topper for more comfort. I do no care for the built-in pillow, so I just sleep with my head at the other end. My teenage son has also used it, and loves the built-in pillow, so I'm sure that is a personal preference. Overall, I'm very satisfied. It inflates and deflates in a matter of minutes, and come with a storage pouch that it will fit into easily."

Taken them to Costa Rica and Mexico on many fly fishing trips, ended up giving them away to the boat captains who admired them. The adjustable pocket clip is unique and securely attaches to any thickness of pants or shorts. The knife itself fits inside and clips to the watch pocket of my jeans, out of the way of the main pocket. The blade is high quality, typical of SOG workmanship. Unfortunately, SOG no longer manufactures this model. When I saw a Mini Auto-Clip knife listed on Amazon, I grabbed it for a spare."

The destroyed box was left on my front porch, and, of course, critical parts of the stand were missing. This may be a good stand, but right now I'm still waiting on the parts that will allow me to assemble it and try it out."
469922,2,"I found the product to be designed OK but poorly manufactured. During assembly, several of the parts did not fit properly. I had to actually drill and tap some of my own screw holes in the metal rods (requiring metal boring drill bits) to even complete the assembly because the alignment was so far off for some of the predrilled screw holes. The directions are minimal, and the only way to correctly assemble the product is to look at the picture on the box. If you are anticipating a high quality product, I would look elsewhere."
191096,1,"This thing is fantastic. It's light, it's super sturdy, and it folds into a nice small size.I took a file to the edge to give it a sharper digging point, this is something I do to all digging tools though. The metal is strong, but takes an edge pretty easily with a metal file.The one downside to it is that if you squeeze the handle to hard the shovel folds. I noticed this when I was digging a hole and was coming down with a stabbing like motion. My natural instinct was to tighten my grip and when I did I could feel the thing fold. After I did this once or twice I was able to remember not to squeeze.All around a great product though. I use it with my gardening around the house, and it will be coming with me on all my future camping trips."

376808,0,"For the price, this is a great mount. This is just about exactly what I wanted and the price couldn't be beat. I was actually looking for something that was steel so I could weld this to a mount in the bed of my pickup. While this mount and others like it do lock, they are bolted down and I find that to be a weakness that is hard to overcome. The fact that it is steel will allow me to weld it to a tubular steel crossmember in the front of the bed (if I get around to it ever). Of course, this WILL compromise the powder coating and require it to be repainted but I'm OK with that for the added security. I usually also use a cable lock for the frame of the bike.I read reviews of the locking lever of the skewer being difficult to open due to the fixed part that it locks to, I have found this indeed to be the case and usually either have something on hand to pry it open or am digging for some random object to do so if I've forgotten it. I do appreciate that I can use my own padlocks instead of being restricted to using a proprietary lock like on a Thule or others."

156337,0,"At over 6' tall, I purchased this product knowing I was just above the recommended height. I purchased it because the image made the height of the chair look like it was roughly the same height as the chair I am using now, relative to my desk. I was grossly mistaken.The model in the picture must be just shy of 5' tall because the chair in person is very small and low to the ground. I had a couple of people try it out (5'10"" and 5'6"") and both of them remarked how low the chair sat, and neither would use the chair because of that reason.Further more, the small size of the actual ball made for an uncomfortable experience. The ball was firmer than most exercise balls and the curvature made an unusual pressure point on the tailbone.I am giving the product 3 stars. With a few caveats this ball chair can still be a good product for some. A) You almost need to be 5'3"" to 5'7"" inches to find this chair suitable. The range they provide is unrealistic for this size chair. B) You wear jeans to work. The rubber grips clothing firmly and it will cause accelerated wear to finer fabrics.All that being said, this chair is still more professional looking for an office environment and it does have some health benefits. You will still get the looks and the questions, but at least it looks like it was built for the office and not the gym, but if you are looking to help your back and posture, I would recommend getting just a plain ball (seems to be a common opinion on this board) instead of this chair."

110073,0,"Okay, maybe it was the wrong timing - should I write this review a couple of weeks ago - it would have another star.I was looking for a cheap mountain bike, and that what I got. If I would get it for $150 (as some of the reviewer here) - I would think this is great value for money, for $270 that I paid - not so much. Now here are some pro and cons...PROS:1) it is still fairly cheap compare to other mountain bikes2) disk breaks are great3) suspension is great as well, making you forget about fairly deep wholes and cracks in pavement4) being able to adjust breaks and gears while riding is very convenient5) gears range is sufficient to climb steep hill, or get a cardio on flat road.CONS:1) It is cheap and therefore - HEAVY. Don't get it if you plan to lift it up often.2) The inside frame is smallish, making it very difficult to mount it on the bike rack (Hollywood for 2 bikes)3) the manufacturer suggest professional set up - its cost of about $50 should be considered along with purchase price4) I opted to set it up myself in local bike shop under supervision of skilled person - it took about 1-2 hours to do, but5) it worked fine until a couple of weeks ago I've notice that the right pedal stuck under odd angle from crank. I didn't address it immediately (didn't have tools handy and forgot to do it at home) and on my next ride it fell off after 4th mile. The metal inside got eaten out and now I need to replace entire crank set (or at least one or both legs of crank set)Can't really blame the workmanship, having it set up myself. However, I can suspect it was set up correctly (no problems in the beginning) and just got loose somehow. Would I get it again? Not for the price..."

283746,2,"I've been on 2 to 4-week wilderness trips in northern Canada and Alaska reaching up to 300-miles from the nearest settlement. Needless to say, there's been bad weather experienced in tents. Never has there been a tent pole failure (an old Eureka 3 season). A Eureka Tetragon 7 was purchased as an inexpensive tent intended for car camping; not for critical dependency. It was delivered late afternoon with expected overnight rain. Good. It could be tested to determine if seam sealer might be needed as a touchup. It went up before nightfall in the back yard. A check the following morning showed one of the two main poles had snapped in half. Though not in the tent overnight to describe wind conditions, there was an indicator. Two 10-ft-diameter outdoor canvas umbrellas had been mistakenly left open overnight. If strong winds had been present, they would not have remained standing. After allowing the tent to dry in what became a sunny day, a closer examination showed the two short poles in sleeves above both doors looked as if someone had deliberately abused them. They would not last much longer. I sent an email to the manufacturer asking if they knew of manufacturing defects. Two months later, there was still no response. That's when this review was submitted. I've since purchase a Marmot Thor P3 expedition tent (for other purposes obviously) and I'm considering a 3-season from Big Agnes or Marmot (at higher prices than the Tetragon 7). Having owned North Face expedition, Eureka 3 season and car camping tents plus experienced other brands on trips, it was unfortunate to permanently eliminate Eureka (now owned be a larger parent company) from any further purchasing decisions. It's a manufacture's decision what kind of reputation they want to develop; no response to an inquiry is not a good customer experience. I will never trust Eureka again."

I received them in a very timely manner even though I live overseas on a military installation. The shipping and timely delivery was great!I used them twice and noticed that the outside edges of the foam handles were beginning to fray. This is a result of the nylon straps rubbing against the foam padding when you do things like bicep curls or any other exercise that involves the handles moving but the padded foam handle remaining still in your hands.I was very disappointed that this was the case and expected a better made handle. If Perform Better had made the foam padding a little shorter than the actual length of the handle, then there would be no problem. My solution was to actually use a scalpel knife and trim the edges of the foam myself so there's no rubbing. I should now get years of workouts out of these handles."

I have lightweight bikes on it, but doubt it would be trustworthy with a 35+lb cruiser or freeride MTB hanging on it.Height adjustment is primitive but fairly straight forward and easy with pinch screw on the wrap-around dual arm. Unfortunately, the pinch bolt requires a wrench so it is not fast to adjust the height of the arms.And unlike other designs, the arms of the bike holding part are one piece meaning they cannot be independently adjusted for height.The stand is solid and fit together fine.

2681,0,"As I had mentioned in my review of the, IMHO, very high quality, Oregon Scientific Pe829A talking pedometer/fm radio, the heart shape units, one of the main units that are more of a little kiddie/giveaway type unit IMO, can vary in quality from model to model.I have owned Bally Total FItness/Park Avenue, Sharper Image, (Seen Here), And Ultmost models, and the quality and accuracy of each unit seems to vary.The Bally/Park Avenue units seem to be the worst, as they are very difficult to even get to count steps, and once you do get them to count steps, they are way to oversensitive, sometimes counting nonexistant steps on their own when sitting on the nightstand/desk.The Sharper Image model that I had was ok, except for the fact that the Battery Holder was damaged when replacing the button cell, thus causing it to malfunction and eventually stop working.As long as you do not drop them on a hard surface, the Ultmost models seem to be the best/most accurate of the bunch.Also, although they do seem to calculate a bit differently, the Sharper Image and Ultmost models do in fact have the same voice chip.The pace melodies on the Bally/Park Avenue models sound the most like a toy out of the bunch, although the others sound pretty much like one as well, or like a modern ice cream truck chime.In conclusion, I'd say that while they last, the Ultmost models of these heart shape units are the best/most accurate of the bunch.Good Luck."

155592,0,"I received this watch as a Christmas present in 2005. I have been using it for the past 6 months (average 2x per week). I spotted this exact watch but with yellowish straps at an expo from Polar after I got my watch for only 2 weeks and was diligent about keeping it clean, but to no avail, it turned yellowish after about 2 months and now it just looks dirty and old, the face is still the original ""ice blue"". If you are thinking about this watch, buy the black one.After I started using it, I wished I went with another model since this one doesn't store any previous data. I track all my runs and sometimes I forget to record before my next run and I lose all my previous data once I press ""start"". In addition, it doesn't have a stopwatch. Once you press stop, it thinks you're done with your workout instead of just a pause or break so you can't track your actual total workout time. I just let it run even when I am at stoplights or water break. If lap feature is important, go with another model. Another complaint about this watch is that there's no backlight. I have to wait till I run under a street light to see my data. The data sheet said it has a backlight but I can't manage to find it.Today both the buttons cracked and fell off my watch. Now it's useless.I still have the most basic model from Polar (bought in 2000 and it's discontinued) that only monitors my HR and that thing still works because there's no buttons to push. Polar makes good HR monitor and I would still buy another one from them. Just not this one."

I took it back to exchange for a non-defective pump, making sure to test before I left the store. Two more of these pumps also had seam leaks! The last one they had in stock was okay. The hose is thin hard plastic with a seam running lengthwise. I can foresee replacing the hose in the future with something more durable."

154129,0,"My wife and I used this pretty regularly for about 10 months.Pros:-- Good workout. Definitely improved cardio and leg strength-- Use of armbands improved effect of cardio workout and arm/shoulder strength-- Small, so it doesn't take up much spaceCons:-- As the title says, it only lasted about 10 months. Frame became bent from use by that point.-- Any use over 10 minutes meant the plastic of the pistons started to melt slightly, causing ""that smell'-- Started squeaking after about two weeks of useOverall, it was a ""get what you pay for"" kind of investment. Definitely got 70 bucks out of it, definitely improved our overall fitness. I'm a big guy (6', 190), and suspect that if it was just my wife, this thing would still be in decent shape."

Also it can be attached to the blackhawk drop down holster platform or the quick disconnect molle platform, both are sold separately. The only con is that it is handgun specific, but thats how they achieve a perfect fit and serpa retention."

140649,0,"I like the product and the thought behind the workouts. It really does make you sweat and the routines build in complexity in a good way.However, the transition between biceps curls and shoulder presses is ridiculous. You can literally spend minutes at a time making tiny wrist adjustments and then holding still, making tiny wrist adjustments and holding still, trying desperately to hit the precise position the game wants - all the while being scolded by the game for not doing it right. There is no way to snap the game out of it and move on.This isn't an exercise you encounter infrequently, and it becomes immensely frustrating at times. There is no way to count on a quick 30-minute workout if this exercise is lurking in your path. Did they not play test it?This would otherwise be a solid four - even four-plus - stars. It's unbelievable that EA Sports would release such an otherwise terrific game with such a huge, annoying flaw."
436274,0,"Please don't sit back and just get comfortable with your history of dominating the Football gaming world. First off - 720p...what's that about - why isn't it 1080i/p yet?I consider myself a different type of gamer...I play about 4 game titles a year and that's it but I play the crap out of those 4 games. My favorite is my Madden and a few other EA sports games and that's all I can fit into my video gaming bag. The last two years I've enjoyed the College Football games much more than the Madden titles. It has nothing a little to do with gameplay but mostly it has to do with longevity...or maybe a new word - gaming elasticity. How long do I play before I'm bored. The college football game has the recruiting piece that adds so much to the dynasty mode and it lets you turnover your roster and discover new players and ways to play with your team. The scouting & draft, coaching changes and free agent period in the Madden games is supposed to provide that same change of pace but those features are so under produced it's not even funny. I'm not really even sure I understand why there is ""scouting"" during the season b/c I don't feel that I get anything out of it. The Coaching change screen seems like it's missing something - why can't I sort out head coach vs. special teams guys etc - the way you could in the past by their ratings on different things. What happened to spring training where I could improve my guys before the season - now there is some weird antiquated practice/training option before each game - no offense but those mini-games aren't that fun and doing it ONE time per season all at once is plenty for me. One other big confusing thing for me is the uniform choice screen - why can't I see what uniform I'm choosing and which one I'm playing against until I get into the game. For instance I choose the cowboys history uni and then I get in the game and see that the other team is wearing white too...how does that work...that seems like something that would get fixed in edit?The Gameplay isn't all bad but a bit frustrating in many areas but mainly turnovers. I love the majority of the running game play but my running back fumbles at least 3 times a game - when is that realistic? The passing...well I'm still working on that one...I know part of the problems there is me - well that and the fact that linebackers apparently all have 3-4 foot verticals to snatch balls out of the air.I'm just pleading that it gets better ever year...I realize it's a new console but Madden has always been the absolute best game out there for so long and these last two years it's fallen way short. Let's get back on top EA."

Looked up the brand on my tag, found the same brand and type of sweats on Amazon, so ordered myself a new pair. My order arrived promptly, no issues there. However, when putting them on for the first time, I noticed one of the drawstrings had sunk back into the waistband. I managed to pull it through, but it wasn't a fun way to start off. A couple days later, the stitching started coming out of various spots on the waistband. And about a week later I noticed the crotch seam had split.

It is very easy to put together and also to transfer between bike trailer and stroller and is relatively easy to pull behind a bike! However, we purchased it with hopes that it will fit two children in the future. I really don't see how two children would fit in it comfortably. The price from Amazon was great! It is approximately $30-$40 cheaper than other places. We chose the free shipping with Amazon and received the trailer within two days. It folds flat, so it will be making a trip to the beach with us in a few weeks. In addition to fitting two children, my only other problem with the product is the buckles are difficult hook. Once my son is in, he's in. Getting him out takes a little work!"
26335,1,"I do a lot of hiking and while I'm happy with traditional hiking boots I've often wished for something robust that had a higher side, to keep out the grit and pebbles that inevitably make their way into my shoes whenever I'm out on the trails. So when I heard about Danner I did some research and looked around for a local stockist, but alas no one within 100 miles had what I was looking for. Normally I'd never buy shoes over the Internet, but with no other option I gave it a shot. The boots arrived quickly and it was immediately apparent that they are a very high quality product. When I tried them on I was very pleased by the comfort and support. A short 150-minute hike revealed that they needed some break-in time, as they left my heels with large blisters. The soles and sides of my feet, however, were totally protected.Now, some weeks and many kilometres later, the boots have broken in to the point where I can comfortably hike for 3 hours under a full pack without blistering or chafing. Hopefully I'll be able to work these boots up to full 10-hour hikes, at which point they will be pretty much everything I could hope for. The thick soles provide plenty of cushion over rough terrain, the waterproofing works (at least through small streams) and the Gore-Tex inserts help my feet breath sufficiently to avoid over-sweating. I'm also really pleased to be able to recommend whole-heartedly an American product that's proudly made in the USA. For too long, US companies have either sent work off-shore or have hidden behind protectionist barriers in order to palm off shoddy products on captive consumers (yes, General Motors and Motorola, I'm talking about you but there are many others) or they've just made junk that relies on brand loyalty alone (Harley-Davidson, please stop making 1930s machines with 1930s mechanical problems). With Danner you get a great product made by great people that is competitively priced and can stand comparison with similar products made anywhere else in the world. America needs more companies like Danner."

In fact, all of our expert camping friends were ooohing and ahhhing as we put up our tent.I would have given this AWESOME TENT 5 stars but I'm taking one away because of the awning! What is up with that thing? We could not figure out how to get it up! We had everybody looking at it and it didn't seem to make much sense to anybody. In fact, I noticed in all of the pictures posted, none of them show the awning. The picture on the box shows the awning poles going down to the ground being held up by nothing!

218947,2,"I bought this Coleman hand pump to go with a Coleman 4-1 twin/king quickbed (which I like a lot). The main disappointment is that the plastic air hose doesn't attach to the vinyl filling valve. You insert the tip, which fits ok but not snugly, put both hands on the pump handle as shown in the box photos, start pumping... and the air tube pops out of the bed. There is a threaded collar made for a different product that doesn't attach to the mattress valve and in fact gets in the way. So the only way to use the pump is to try and hold the air tube on the filler nozzle with one hand and pump with the other. The threaded collar can't be removed without breaking it off, in which case one might be able to duct tape or clamp the air hose to the filler nozzle. I expected better, both because of the completely misleading picture on the box and the fact that I was using two Coleman products that I expected would play well together. Disappointing design that I can't figure out why no one else mentions."

241632,0,"I purchased this bike in August and promptly started to assemble the bike. When I tried to attach the front brake rotor the 6 screw holes on the hub did not line up to the mounting spacer provided. I called the number on the waranty card (World Wide Cycle) and the person on the phone told me that I actully had voided the waranty by assembling the bike myself. It had to be assembled by a certified bike shop and that was printed on the outside of the shipping box. There is no such statment on the outside of the box.I did email Columbia directly and explaned the problem. They promptly sent out another spacer and 6 bolts, That is why I gave them 3 stars and not 2. It turns out the hole pattern on the wheel hub is not spaced correctly when measured with a gauge. I am able to get 5 of the 6 bolts in the spacer.Has anyone else had this problem?This is my second bike. My first bike I purchased in 1994. I purchased it from a bike shop and road it very heavily. I am really impressed with the quality of this bike aside from the brake issue. I hope I can get it resolved as well."

The felt feels cheap, the cupholders are very cheap plastic inserts that fall out constantly when unpacking and packing, and it feels like something someone build in their garage using wood and parts from a home improvement store. The carrying case zippers ripped on day one (another reviewer said something similar).That said, it does serve the basic purpose and is fairly cheap, so if you're looking for something that is just better than the dining room table, this will do it. It's a little too heavy to return easily, so I'll probably keep it. In retrospect, I'd rather have spent another $50 and gotten a nicer table with a plush edge."

These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I've been through - including 5.11, Woolrich, etc. I think the best feature on these pants - which isn't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side (for me, the strong side). This pocket, placed directly behind the front pocket (and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer's) has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached. The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size, such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis.

We took it to Lake Powell and it was perfect! Not a winter/cold tent - but great for summer/warm weather. LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Look forward to many more adventures!
416210,2,"I bought this watch primarily as a running timer. It is marginal for that use. First, the chronograph numerals are small and hard to see during the day and nearly impossible to see at night. Secondly, depending on the time, the watch hands may obstruct your view of the chronograph. So, if you're thinking of purchasing this watch for running, you might think twice."
100360,2,"I am not a boxer - amateur or otherwise. I like the heavy bag for arm workouts. I used these on my 100lb. neva-tear bag, and after the second use, the spandex material is already tearing at the knuckles. The left hand thumb stitching came apart too. Don't expect to get much use out of them. Also, they don't protect the forefinger area, so punching has to be more controlled - which isn't a bad thing unless you miss - ouch! Gel area provides good cushioning, but I still had the red (bloody) areas between the bottom of my fingers - same as I get with cloth wraps. Good wrist support, and faster to put on than wraps, but at least you can wrap the areas you want with more material using traditional wraps. Not worth the price."
322405,0,"Although the box appeared undamaged, the bike arrived dented on the main frame. There was also a screw missing so we ended up just skipping putting on the plastic decorative pieces on the handlebars. There were no tools included to put the bike together, so make sure you have access to your own. The brake system is tricky to adjust so that the brake pads don't rub the tire on one side. Overall, the bike is a sturdy construction and my son loves it. We were just a bit disappointed in the condition it arrived in."

484977,0,The system was easy to set up. The problem with it is the 200 watt inverter did not work. I had also read a reviewthat mentioned the same think but did not think much of it. I sent the defective item back but it was returned back.I was told that I would have to send the entire kit back. Problem was the kit was already mounted. It would be too much trouble to pack it up again. Not very impressed with the service.

130495,0,its a decent stand but it wont hold any bike of weight if they added or had avalible an option of adding weight to it it would be nice i now use it as an extra stand in the garage im not worried if it gets grabbed because it is tough to carry your best stand around all the time but for on the road or heading out its ok but i wont buy another a great starter stanD thats what it was for me and i do still have it so there it is
39300,0,"received these as a present for my 26th Birthday, and I was quite pleased at first with the ease of selecting the weights and the obvious convenience factor of having the various weights in one bundled package.However, the weights are cumbersome when compared to traditional gym weights. In addition, the selection mechanism is known to break, and BowFlex does not ship just the plastic tabs because ""the handles are assembled in a factory and are not serviceable."" They want over $60 for the handle assembly shipped...which is total bull considering the defect involves a piece of ABS plastic worth a fraction of a cent to make.As far as the plastic part that keeps breaking is concerned, I figured out a very easy fix. Without pictures it's slightly difficult to explain, but here's what I did:1. Removed the round BowFlex 'B' labels freom either side of the handle to expose the 3/4 nut and bolt head.2. Marked each of the weight selection rings, the metal locking ring, and the end caps with a permanent marker to keep everything aligned during re-assembly.3. The issue I was having was only with one of the plastic interlocks, so I took the 3/4 nut off and slid the affected side off as an assembly.4. Careful - there are two ball bearings with springs behind them that push into the metal locking ring to give the selection a secure ""ratcheting"" feel. Be careful not to lose either.5. There are two Philips screws that go through a curved metal plate. Behind the plate is a spring and the plastic interlock/tab that pushes into the metal ring to lock the weights.6. I simply noted the length of the interlock tab, clipped it off flush with a pair of dykes, and drilled out where the tab was. Then I found a machine screw that was the size of the hole I drilled and threaded the bolt into the drilled hole. After noting how far the screw had to protrude to correctly lock with the metal ring, I hacksawed the excess and ground the exposed tip round so it wouldn't catch or scrape up the locking ring.7. Re-assembled.This worked for me, but I obviously won't guarantee it will fix your weight selection problems. I suppose I can get pictures of the fixed piece so curious people will know what I'm describing."

490390,1,"I love this knife! I'm just looking at it her and I'm disappointed because it was about half the price here than it was at the specialty shop in the mall. But I still don't care, even 70 bucks was worth this blade. I got the half serrated model 4.5"" for work and I use it very frequently for cutting open boxes, tearing through wrapped pallets, all that sort of stuff. Its incredibly sharp and very dangerous (which is good, a safe knife doesn't exist, which is why I'm glad they included a safety). The release is fast as lightning, I clocked it at .124 seconds from the time the mechanism kicks in to the time its fully locked a ready. Its also very sharp, I managed to get through one of those impossible to open electronics packages in a matter of seconds. Get it, the mechanism will never wear out and its a fantastic blade, especially at this low price."

326387,0,"This binocular has a nice tight feel. It is easy to focus, light in weight, and is very easy to adjust. The field of view is actually 441 feet at 1000 yards, not the advertised 330 yards. This was an error in the specifications as listed on the Amazon web site. Bushnell indicates that this model ( 13-2000 ) has a 441 feet @ 1000 yard field of view.The unit I initially received had a minor flaw on the interior coating of one of the objective lenses. Apparently there is some room for improvement with Bushnell's quality control program.I am waiting for a replacement of this same model, so I would say that overall I am pleased with the unit."

It is true that the fender won't prevent all the water and mud from coming off your front wheel, and your shoes might get a little wet. But this is much better then what would happen without it.

446881,0,"The good- it doesn't roll in the brackets: the bar comes with hexagonal shaped ends, which won't roll around.- easy to remove off the brackets, for storage.- it looks good: chrome bar with black foam handles.The not so good:- comes with no instructions...- the screws included are too short for a regular wall (screws are 1'', the drywall is 1/2'', which leaves another 1/2 to reach in wood stud ?). I replaced them with number 8, 2'' long wood screws, and they went just fine.- the brackets have a poor design: even thought they have locking latches, and the bar's ends are hexagonal, the bar is a little bit loose in the brackets.- if used in a wider space, the bar slightly bends in the middle. Mine is 42'' wide. They should have used a stronger gauge metal. The fix: place a steel bar inside the bar to enforce it (maybe a rebar from your hardware store, like a 3/4'' rebar)- the grips are hard to move along the bar. The ""fix"" is to ""roll them up"" on the bar, like a shirt's sleeve, and move them to your location on the bar, and then roll them down. Annoying, but works.Overall:- no instructions- short screws- poor design brackets- bends in the middle- foam grips won't move easy"
94672,0,This holster does NOT fit the PT145 Millenium Pro. The picatinny rail is very tight and the snap will NOT work. The front sight will hang up when you pull the gun. Could get you killed in a defense situation!
78750,0,"I thought it would be like a traditional lifting strap. I figured these would be stronger because they're made of nylon but without the padding on them, they rubbed my skin and left marks for a week at a time. They do their job, but it scrapes your skin at the same time making the next few days a little irritating. They were stiff at first, but I wore them in. If you wrap the strap on top of itself, it won't work right. You have to wrap it so you only grab a single layer at a time. Its a hundred times more effective that way. All in all, it's a great product. I just wish it didn't hurt my wrists as much."
75909,1,This product is a tiny folding stove that takes uphardly any room at all and holds a pretty large pan.I haven't used it yet as I bought it for back upsurvival emergency use. I did get one for a gift toa camper friend though. Love the way it folds up tosuch a tiny package.
509717,0,"I have had this bike for a year now, trying to use it on the occasional 10-mile commute. I can say the following things after putting it through at least 500 miles:sizing - I am 5'10 and it was just fine. The geometry is comfortable, and the ride a little stiff but bearable. It is very fast because it is so light (for this price range), about 24lbs.brakes - barely adequate, quite spongy. The calipers flex so it is hard to put full force on them. This works fine at low speed, but if you're trying to slow down on a big downhill going 40mph, its going to be a little scary.drivetrain - rear = good, front = bad. It is impossible to tune the front derailleur so that it doesn't throw the chain and rub like crazy. This is because of 3 reasons: a crappy derailleur, a chainring that isn't quite true, and a loose bottom bracket (pedal bearings). I think the bottom bracket got loose over time, and I don't have the tool to tighten it back up.wheels/tires - great! They arrived pretty straight, and I trued them just for fun. I have had no problems at all with them.I must add that even though many components are aluminum, it still has lots of steel parts that will easily rust if left outside, just like any other bike.Overall, you get what you pay for. This bike has a good frame/fork but pretty low quality components that will wear out in less than 1000 miles. I would only recommend it for occasional recreational use that wouldn't hit that kind of mileage."
6094,1,"I now commute to work a little over a mile and also use my bike when grocery shopping. The rack is very sturdy and handles all the weight I have put on it so far. I also bought the Topeak folding basket that slides onto the groove on top of the rack and keeps it locked in place. It's a great system. Since my bike frame didn't have predrilled holes for the front frame brace connection, I just drilled out the holes a little larger and put the braces on the seat stem height adjustment bolt. Been using this rack over a month now and it has allowed me to carry groceries in the basket instead of in a backpack. I would recommend this to anyone that regularly needs to carry things and doesn't want to use a backpack to do it. Bill"

454824,1,"I've never used a heart rate monitor while running before, and now I am not sure why I did not try this sooner. The monitor works flawlessly every time.

484899,0,"These are nicely styled compared to what is available as hiking shorts in any local stores. My only complaint is the use of velcro to hold the pockets closed. It is necessary to 'peel' your pockets open thus, it takes two hands to put your wallet back in the pocket. Try doing that while sitting in your car. Otherwise, nice shorts."
119459,2,"Although it gives the appearance of a solid product, this press is a textbook example of poor engineering. I want to consider two issues separately, design and reliability.Design:This device appears to have been designed by successive corrections of mistakes, rather than by following a global engineering plan. To disassemble and clean the priming system, for example, requires unscrewing several layers of components. In addition, screw heads are not aligned in an intelligent manner so that you can reasonably comfortably use a screwdriver or other tools. Components critical to the proper functioning of the press are installed in a way that proper placement can't be seen, such as some of the primer smaller parts, made of fragile plastic. Changing the shell holder plate is a cumbersome process prone to mistakes - for example, the indexing ball bearing can easily fall off if extreme care is not taken. Changing the primer plunger is also cumbersome and the smaller plunger does not necessarily properly line up with the center of the primers. The issue of design is not a problem until you have to take the press apart (which happens often, as we will see next) and find yourself working through layer upon layer of mechanical components. On the plus side, the die plates give a measure of flexibility.Reliability:The awkward mechanical complexity would be tolerable if the device were reliable, but it nothing like that at all. The main culprit is the priming system. It takes only a few granules of powder to fall into the priming system to inhibit it from working properly, and for you to spend significant time accessing the internal components of the priming system to clear that one granule of powder. You have to go through several layers of unscrewing, with screws of different sizes and lengths to get to the place of interest (the screws do not line up with accessible space, remember). Astonishingly, the most critical components in the priming system are made of extremely fragile plastic and are very prone to failure.Conclusion:This press gives the impression of solidity, and as long as nothing goes wrong with the priming system you can argue it is relatively solid. However, solidity and strength do not translate into reliability when a critical component stands in the way."
436552,0,"Overall Im happy with the shorts... I mean, it's really a piece of fabric to cover part of your legs.I have to say thou, one must double clarify the size thing on these.

These tires do slide on and off without difficulty, and I have had NO problems with pinch-flats, even on the cute little board bridges that go over NOTHING every quarter mile on some of our bike trails. I also run tire liners and thorn-resistant tubes, BTW, so I don't get the puncture problem (and yes, I inspect and clean the inner and outer surface of the tire at every change - it's been about a month between flats). Not a bad tire, though, and it rides well. NOTE: I am now in Albuquerque but haven't changed my review profile yet (hence, the goat-heads!)."

Otherwise I am totally happy with them. I love how they wrap around the sides and cut out the glare and sun, and the moment I put them on I could feel my eyes relax. I couldn't believe how well they fit and how natural they feel, considering they are going over another pair of glasses. I live in AZ and have recently found out that I am already developing cataracts, even though I am not that old. Evidently the sun and dryness of our weather are contributing factors. I will not be without these from now on. I consider these a great find and have already sent them to my mom and dad."

They fell off!!!! I was expecting to have to suck it in to get the zipper to close and I wore a pair of yoga shorts under them to prevent a rash since I have wetsuits and knew what to expect.These were HUGE!!!!!!! Like I said I ordered a size smaller than what the measurements indicate on the sizing chart and I cannot keep the things up. I didn't even need to use the zipper to get them off once I realized how oversized they are.I should of just worn wetsuit shorts I already own and saved my money.

I'm sure it will last for a while, but I plan on modifying the bolsters and screws to insure that part of this thing doesn't go flying when I try to use it. Bottom line, if you are a collector looking for something to put on your wall and nothing more that I would give this 5 stars and say buy it for sure. But if you are a practicer of one of some form of edge weapon art then I would say try to find one elsewhere first, but if you cannot this will work fine......with some modifications."

444127,1,"I had never saw the timepiece in person, but I was easily convinced that it was a remarkable looking one just from the hi-res pictures from a Google search.If you're wondering about the heritage of the watch, check out this awesome site that discusses all the different versions of the Nighthawk that are out there: [...]Pros:-Remarkable looking timepiece. It's a flight watch, so it is bound to be busy looking in the dial. However, the layout of the intricate details is done impeccably such that each detail fits in place.-The illuminated hands and markers really do shine in the dark, a lot more than my other timepieces that cost more.-Bracelet is a brushed steel (i.e., not shiny), which means it shouldn't appear scratched as easily as the polished bracelets.-Haven't seen another flight watch that looks better than it (Invicta makes a nearly identical one...I'm pretty sure Citizen had the design first).-Heavy watch (not necessarily a good thing, but confirms that it is indeed stainless steel)-Eco-Drive technology (supposedly, that means you never have to replace the battery; I'm pretty sure the battery will eventually need to be replaced, not because it's out of juice, but because no battery lasts forever).Cons:-Crystal is mineral, not sapphire. Then again, I don't think you can find a timepiece at this price point that offers sapphire crystal. It seems that all Citizens only come in mineral, which is disappointing, since Citizen is a renowned enough company that they should be willing to offer sapphire in their products.-The clasp scratches very very easily."

So, if you plan on using your bike on a trainer, you are out of luck. I found extension cables that allowed me to install the sensors on my rear wheel...however, when that arrived it didn't work. So, I ended up sending everything back."

462560,2,"These ear Buds are not the most comfortable items to wear nor do they stay in the ears.

I guess these are good for something, but I am not sure what."
270929,1,"This crop comes with 2 stitched, leather tongues that are both longer and better quality over the cheaper crops. (Plus these are tongues, not a small ""loop"" of leather.) The $7 shipping from this seller comes with first-class shipping so that seems like a fair charge.Note: this crop does NOT come with a secured handle loop. If you're worried about a secure grip, you could probably attach a braided one at the top of the handle. I like the slotted handle though - and in my mind makes up for not having this particular loop.A fine tool overall."
221334,0,"This review is for two similar Coleman Xtreme coolers, which are virtually the same size on the exterior: the 70-quart, 5-day, BLUE cooler and the 56-quart, 6-day, GREEN cooler. By the way, these coolers do not come equipped with a plastic shelf to keep food suspended above the melt water.First, let me say that Coleman made its reputation years ago with its workhorse, white-gas cook stoves and lanterns. Today Coleman mostly makes products for backyard use and casual family camping. Coleman generally does not make quality products for avid outdoors people operating in rugged or demanding conditions, so you can't expect too much when purchasing a Coleman product.That said, I went through Amazon.com to purchase a Green Coleman 6-day cooler because I didn't want to shell out hundreds of dollars more for a tougher product and because I needed a cooler that would fit comfortably between the gunwales of our canoes. So far, I have used this cooler on two river trips, the first of which lasted seven days in southern Utah during September, 09. The weather was hot, but could have been hotter. Our block ice lasted 6 days, and on the 7th day we had plenty of ice water, so the cooler achieved its 6-day rating.This was followed with a 4-day trip in October, which wasn't long enough to test the cooling performance of the cooler, but did reveal the cooler's low-quality construction. On the second day out, one of the handles came off when its plastic retaining pin fell out. A member of our party had with them a smaller Coleman Xtreme cooler, and both of its hinges were broken off and useless. So, if you plan to use this cooler much, I would suggest taking the preventive measures described below. And then try to be gentle with it.A few weeks ago I purchased a 70-quart, 5-day Blue cooler at Wal-Mart for $30. At this price I couldn't pass it up. Apparently the store had a few of these left over from last year, and they were being sold at a deep discount because Wal-Mart is featuring a different Coleman Xtreme product line this year. I haven't used this cooler yet, but I can describe how the two Xtreme coolers compare physically.NOTE: See my ""customer images"" available under the main product photo to see what I am describing here.On the exterior, the two coolers are indistinguishable except for the colors. Same cheap plastic hardware on both. On the interior, the 6-day green cooler has noticeably thicker walls implying more insulation, and thus 20 percent less volume than the blue 5-day cooler.Here are the fixes I have adopted in an effort to overcome the flimsy hardware issues. When I got home from the second river trip, I used a screwdriver to pry out the plastic retaining pins on the two handles (two pins each) and glued them back into place with Gorilla glue. This I expect will hold the pins in place for a while. On the newer cooler, I removed the plastic handles altogether and replaced them with rope handles. This type of handle has the advantage of remaining in a fixed position (unlike the original sliding plastic handles) allowing me to run a strap between them to secure the lid in case of a canoe upset.On the interior of each cooler, I have screwed into place a short nylon strap between the lid and the side wall. The strap is long enough to allow the lid to open beyond 90 degrees and remain in an upright and open position, but the strap is short enough to prevent the lid from extending backward far enough to place excessive strain on the hinges. I am hoping this will keep the hinges from snapping anytime soon."

If you're working out on concrete and really can't handle a thin mat, this might be a good option, but just consider yourself warned that this mat is very slippery when you're sweaty. I sweat very efficiently, and I have to put a towel down just to hold myself in place during certain workouts. Given that this mat was more expensive than many others, I'm a little disappointed with its performance from that perspective. That said, this mat is so thick it could also double as a thin camping mattress/pad. So, maybe I am really getting my money's worth. :)"

If you learn like me, then they will get a little beat up, but I have sadly sent a few flying into stone walls. The blade has never broken or chipped. The weight is also good for their size. They are amazing with short distance fast speed half spin throws. They fly just as well when throwing full spin. If you're looking to learn to throw I would strongly recommend this knife. Of course it will take some time to find your grip and get a feel for distance and spins, but once you get a feel for throwing in general, this knife will not let you down."

446503,0,"I purchased this machine and loved it at first. It was a little hard to get used to the resistance as I was always an avid weight lifter. I wanted something that was quick and easy. This was the machine.Now, why I do not use it any longer. As I progressed I felt something was lacking with this machine. I determined it was the power rods. They just do not offer even resistance. What I mean by this is example, a rod is rated at 50 pounds resistance, BUT, that is only when you can get full tension on the rod. Many exercises are situated in a way in which it is not possible to fully contract the power rods. The smaller your body type the more pronounced this will become.If you are serious about getting and staying in shape I would bypass this machine and take a look at the new machines from Bowflex that no longer use the power rods."

212863,0,"I bought this grille as an addition to the the three burner grill. It is OK for steaks, hamburgers, etc. (flat stuff) but since it is so short the maximum height of your food is about 4"", maybe 5""( no roasts, chicken or turkey). The box has a bottom made of paint covered sheet steel. It started to peel and rust right away since you can get the box so hot the paint can't take it. When the grill was set on medium, the steel plate bottom glowed cherry red hot. When this happens, the box starts to rust right away.If you lower the heat, the grill plates don't get hot enough for grilling and burgers take forever. The exterior holds up OK but the interior doesn't. Like the Webber grills, the paint or coating on the interior top starts to bake off and peel. My Webber took 5 years to start this process, the Camp Chef started right away. If you have bought the three burner unit and want to grill, this is the only option but I don't rate it very high. The idea is good but the function leaves something to be desired. Oh one other point. I bought the wind screen for the burners because of windy conditions. You can't place both on the burners at the same time! So if you need a screen for the third burner, you're out of luck."
379612,2,"I was only able to wear this suit a couple of times,due to it ripping. The first time I wore it the rubber band came out of one of the legs. Maybe I just received one of bad quality."
903,0,"The design of the card holders is okay. The problem is that it was put together with low quality glue. It is basically a sandwich of plastic, rubber, rubber, and another piece of plastic. One rubber piece is supposed to be glued to each piece of plastic. However, the glue used was so cheap that the rubber was peeling away from the plastic. When trying to use them, the cards would go between the rubber and plastic instead of between the 2 rubber pieces. Luckily everything was screwed together so it was easy to disassemble. I took off the rubber pieces and re-glued them with model cement like the stuff used to put model cars and airplanes together. After reassembly, they worked pretty good.They are a bit pricey for what you get. It's just molded plastic, rubber, and screws.When I first took them out of their box, they were a little worn from rubbing against each other. They probably should put some cheap cardboard between them to prevent this. But, it's not a big deal either. They're just going to get worn when using them anyway.I did like that they came in four different colors.If you have the tools, you can easily make some cardholders out of a piece of wood. My dad and I made 8 of them in about 30 minutes. They are about 11'' wide with 3 slots to hold the cards. They work great. I'd say even better than the plastic card holders."

107315,1,"I have purchased two of these and I am on line to purchase another. The pluses and minuses:Pluses:- Perfect size. Pour in a 12 oz can and it fits perfect- This thing REALLY works. I love it!! While you shouldn't expect it to take a warm drink and get it cold, it will take a fairly cold drink and keep it cold. It will keep it cold for at least 45 minutes or so.- If you don't drink very fast, there will be a portion of the drink that will turn to ice. Kind of fun.Minuses:- Really only one, but a big one. Like I mentioned above, I have had two of these things. I just threw away the second one. It lasted about a year, and then the side split open. Same thing happened to the other one. I can't figure out if there is anything in particular that I have done to cause this. I have never put it in the dishwasher (directions say not to and that is a VERY good direction). I typically just rinse it off and put it back in the freezer.Even with the minus, I still want to purchase another one. It is that good and it works very well. The company should probably do a little better job of quality control on the production so this won't happen."

It worked pretty well for a while, but then over time it felt like the gel was breaking up and then I left the bike in the sun and the gel started to melt an ooze out of the material. That was it, it was ruined. It lasted one season of riding. Felt good when it worked. It did the job of getting me acclimated to my bike seat. After a good season of riding i didn't need it any more, the standard saddle is fine."

When I asked him why he didn't ride more, he said it hurt his back. I have actually ridden this bike as well and it is a bit uncomfortable. I wish I would have gone with the more expensive version that had the rolls for the back instead of this hard 'cushion.' The only other problem is that it is hard to steer and impossible to back up. You have to literally pick it up and move it to turn it around in a small space."

I do my yoga on a wood floor and with the mat it is still very hard and not that comfortable. I can deal with it though. It is nice and long so i can stretch out head to toe, but the width is sort of thin too. Not very wide, so if I lay on my side with my knees at a 90 degree angle they go off the mat. They are very sticky so that is nice, no slipping! Over all it's a decent mat but not perfect."

It's a little noisy when hitting the bag, much more so than the $2-300 speed bags...but the price is good so its acceptable. What isn't acceptable is that the height adjustment screws don't keep the platform from sliding up and down the track when you hit the bag. I've tightened them as much as I can and they still don't hold it in place. Of course you could rig something up to stop it from moving..but that takes away the functionality of it being adjustable in the first place."

But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her. I'm glad they are now using a read model. They held up for a few months before they ripped. They served their purpose."

276279,2,"When I read other reviews that said it was dangerous to assemble, I just thought maybe they weren't doing it correctly. Be forewarned, until you put the bolts/screw in (which we didn't receive), the trampoline CAN snap shut with FORCE. My husband was injured. Having three adults is the best safety precaution, just make sure they are all in place before the final stretching into place of the trampoline. One strong adult can push the trampoline into place, while two others can hold it down to make sure their half does not snap back while the bolts/screws are being put in. I wouldn't have attempted this in the first place if I knew the potential for injury. It's just not worth it."

414767,0,"I am rating this sleeping bag 3 stars because it might be alright for some people, but it wasn't for me. Having read the positive Amazon reviews, and pleased with its price, I was enthusiastic at first about this product. My significant other has a Slumberjack single bag that he has used for years with no problems and high satisfaction, for instance. And it seemed to be roomy and of good quality, from the descriptions. However, when I opened this product, spread it out on the livingroom floor and looked it over closely, several things were apparent. The fabric and insulation is not of high quality, being rather limp, and the actual construction was not acceptable. The sewing of the sections was crooked (the plaid pattern of the flannel liner was slanted), made worse by the fact that there is stitching through the batting only every 10-12"". Immediately I thought of two grown adults rolling around on it for the 8 day car camping trip we were planning and said to myself: fiberfill balls and lumps a go-go. It also simply didn't f-e-e-l like it would really keep us warm to 40/30 degrees, thinking longingly of the single down bags we would be leaving behind in order to enjoy the couple-friendly experience promised by a double bag. Granted, I did not test the temperature comfort factor there on the livingroom floor, but I was not convinced we would not be okay in the elements without the added cargo of added blankets (no big deal, maybe, if you have a Hummer, but we have a Subaru station wagon). The pillows are miniature and flat, and will not please those used to a full size bed pillow or someone like me with a long neck. The bag is indeed roomy, and this point I want to highlight as a positive. It is absolutely true that a 6' person and mate could sleep in this bag, probably with their large dog, and be reasonably accomodated. However, having shipped the bag back to Amazon, I immediately proceeded to REI for an upgrade, where I found the Kelty Eclipse double bag, which excells in construction, materials and overall design sophistication, at the exact same price (on sale). Slumberjack? What Slumberjack?"

229588,0,"I bought a pair of these for qiqong and kung-fu practice a few months ago and I have to say they are working out better than I expected. They are durable, flexible and light. My only complaint is that it feels like the sides of my feet are hanging over the sides of the sole. This makes it a little harder to balance sometimes. However a larger shoe size is too big. Other than that I'd say this is a decent shoe, especailly for the price you pay."
191932,1,"The clubs are very inexpensive and are great quality. I purchased a set of Dunlop clubs and also these Cougars. With the Cougars I drive farther and my short game is also better. The only thing I did not like was the bag, but for the price you can afford to buy another bag."
388189,0,"The product itself is cool. Slides on the show a little. I got my brother some a few years ago. I don't remember what company I ordered his from here on Amazon. This current purchase was to my brother-in-law and was from FootSmart and I received an email that said shipped and will arrive before Christmas (was Christmas gift) when infact they were back-ordered. They were not actually received until Jan 18th. Furthermore, they claim to have sent a second set to rush the order and want me to ask my new brother-in-law to return the second set on his dime and time. Extremely awkward and odd if you ask me. I was not pleased at all."
480165,2,"I purchased this thinking it had the hammock with it. It was sent to my daughter and she was seriously disappointed, as well as we were, that there was not a hammock. The product is great, but needed more details."
449136,0,"This really is a great product, but with one annoying flaw. I've been working out for years and started with the #1 which was perfect. I can just about close it 10 times per set and I already feel the difference in my grip strength when I do heavy lifts at the gym.However, the issue with the abrasiveness of the handles is a very true and annoying one that you won't realize until you really start using it. I read the other reviews before purchasing and thought people were just exaggerating but it's true.I definitely don't have soft, girly hands but I developed blisters on my fingers that caused me to have to stop using it for a while to let them heal.Maybe I'll develop tougher calluses, but until then, it sucks to not be able to use it as often as I'd like to."
12790,1,"I bought this gun 6 years ago! believe it or not it still works and with no leaks, thanks to the gun oil it kept strong and shoots as hard as when i first got it! I bought it to take down rats on my chicken coup, but i use it to kill squirrels because its soo powerful and dead accurate! Love this Gun!!"

492145,0,"These are my first set of knives, but they seemed really nice. They're much heavier than I expected. They are VERY loud if they don't stick into wood. The weight of them is probably the culpret here. I got the large ones.Right then, down to business: One of them broke on the first real throwing session I had with them (around 60 throws). It broke at the second hole down from the blade, straight across. These blades seemed indestructible, but they apparently aren't. I got these blades because they seemed to be of higher quality (all one metal piece, nothing to break off), but when there's only one thing to break, and that ONE thing breaks, the entire knife is ruined (obviously).TLDR; They're fun, but they break across the middle of the blade at the holes in the butt. Also, maybe a bit heavy if you're not trying to draw attention to your new hobby."
80700,1,"For the price, really good. Looks nice even when the bike is not on it. Could also be used as a hat or coat rack. Puts my bike into an unused nook in the wall, freeing up some floorspace, and it actually turned my bike into a piece of art, too.Its a little bit cumbersome to get the front wheel around the hook, but its not too bad once you get the hang of it. The plastic rear wheel holder will stick better with some screws thru the pre-countersunk holes, but it should be fine with just the double stick tape provided, nothing pulling it off the wall anyways. Time will tell how it holds up, but it seems like a pretty quality rack. Id recommend it if you keep you bike inside your house/apartment."
5073,0,"Shipping was expected, upon inspecting the unit found the box torn like someone already received it and tore the box when opening, this made me pay attention to all parts were as listed, only to find the screw that secures the magnet missing, all items were in sealed plastic bags, needless to say I returned it."
18611,0,"We've had this treadmill for exactly 1 year and it gets regular use. It had been fine up to this point, but we had to have the belt and frame replaced last week - thank goodness for the warranty. The technician that repaired it said that this model has a very weak frame and cracks are common. Ours had cracked all the way from end to end! I suspect that part of the problem is my husband's heavy running because I had never had any problems with it and I normally just walk or jog lightly. The belt also slips and rubs the sides sometimes. It's a decent value for the money and great for walking or light jogging, but if you intend to use it for heavy running, invest in the more sturdy gym-quality ones."
197291,1,My 5 1/2 yr old son had the original Razor for years and wanted to do more tricks. The A3 has a wheelie bar and bigger wheels. I actually love riding it too. The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is I thought the A3 had a kick stand (saw it on a website) so it didn't have to be laid on the ground when not in use.
239942,0,I got this barrel for christmas and it seemed pretty nice except i wasnt that happy when i played with it. the barrel kept on chopping my paintballs which i later found out that it only fits a certain type of balls. the barrel adapter is also not that great and it doesnt completley align the barrel with the gun which keeps the paintball from fitting into the barrel causing it to chop. I would like to say though that tippmann did not lie about the range difference. when i went to try-city i could see that the paintballs were flying out of the field from the other side.
333592,1,"I bought these to wear in the Merrel Down & Dirty Mud Run and they were great! They stayed on through all of the obstacles - even the mud pit!

318237,1,"My wife received these in a care package during her deployment in Iraq. Sometimes she can't shower due to mission activities, sometimes the showers are broke, sometimes she just needs a refresher in the middle of the day since you can boil water outside in the summer with no flame.She loves them, plain and simple. They're bigger than the standard baby wipes and you don't smell like a baby walking around all day plus they actually stand up to the abuse better than others."
142687,0,"These ear muffs are not adjustable and barely fit. I am 5'10"" tall and weigh 185 # so I don't think I have a large head. I have to tilt them back a bit to ensure my ears are completely covered. They do work well but are not comfortable."
114512,2,"Even after wiping down the mat, it is hard to work on because it is so slippery. After 3-4 classes, the mat is wearing down and has holes in places. I got this as a gift and will be upgrading to a higher quality mat as I am an advanced yogi."

124146,0,"This watch serves its purpose but it has several issues1) The digital portion tends to lock up.On several occasions, the digital part of the watch just froze. Sometimes it would clear up,but other times it would begin to beep without ceasing. I quickly figured out the only way to stop it was to hold all four buttons inat the same time until it completely reset. Then I had to re-enter everything and re-synchronize the digital and analogue. Total PITA.2) The Indiglo tends to randomly turn to night mode.This seems to happen whether you hold the appropriate button for that feature or not. This drains the battery.3) Short batter lifeI've run the heck out of my watch, I freely admit, but my first battery only lasted a year-and-a-half. I suspect Indiglo is much to blame, but it is probably the analogue side of things too.Bottom Line:I won't say don't buy this watch. It's one of the few hybrids out there and it does the job. Just have all the facts going in."
374682,0,"This knife was super tight. I tested it out by chopping down a small tree, maybe 4 inches in diameter, and the edge got a little bent, so when i tried to fix it, a chunk of the blade broke off. The metal isn't strong enough for the size of the knife."
29008,0,"I've had this lock for a few weeks now and it works great. The key is nice and the locking mechanism is quite smooth. It is heavy, but that is what I expected with a u-lock.The mount that comes with it to attach it to your bike is horrible though. It fits poorly to a round bar (on your frame), doesn't come with a hexagonal wrench you need to install it and when mounted, it is far from secure (both the mount on the bike and the lock on the mount). Really poorly constructed. If you are planning on mounting this lock onto your frame I'd think twice before buying this. I hang the lock on the middle of the frame between my legs instead.In conclusion, good lock with horrible bike mount."
67964,1,"Solid feel. Probably 3/16 steel. Sharp edge and integrated sharpener. Comfortable shaped handle with tacky feel. Well made, and USA made! An was about 25 percent cheaper than buying in a local store. I'm happy."
510724,0,"I had initially purchased this jacket since it seemed reasonably priced and would help me achieve the free shipping I needed for my other purchases. It's a very conventional track jacket, but for most people, I would recommend sizing DOWN. I normally wear large sweaters and ordered medium, and it was still very bulky. Unfortunately, I'd have to pay for shipping both ways if I want to exchange the item, so I've decided to keep this slightly oversized jacket."
262702,0,"The baskets are pretty great. The issue I have is the clips that hold it to your rack. They are not big enough and required some bending to fit right as they don't exactly fit well. If the screws were longer it would of been better. Because of that, it was extremely difficult to get it on and took two people. After it was mounted, it works fine."
108432,2,"Amazon sent me a used, dirty, broken watch. There was no manual or any other documents inside the box. Completely unacceptable from Amazon."
396373,2,"I thought these ran very small, ordered them for lounging and sleeping but I thought they were at least 1 size smaller. Very short, they went to goodwill next day. Price was good but not worth returning."
346701,1,"I couldn't give any less that 5 stars due to the fact that they are really nice sunglasses. They were just to big for my face which isn't Ray Bans fault. I ended up sending them back and getting the cockpit style which fit way better. I have a narrow face and the tear drop style which these were just looked ginormous. So, I guess if you have a larger face these would be perfect. I just love the aviator style...it's timeless. I remember my uncle who is a pilot wearing them 25yrs ago and the style is still going strong."
161780,2,"i read the reviews saying 1 wasnt enough for people's pools, so i bought 2 thinking it would be enough for my above ground pool, sadly it wasn't. my pool is a decent size, i think 24 round 4ft deep, and 2 is definitely not enough, maybe if i bought another 5-6 lights and my whole pool would be lit. the light when it's in the pool reaches down to the floor, but it doesnt spread out far, maybe a foot around the item. also it has to be like pitch black outside for you to see the lights, but its so pretty. theres also like 3-4 different light speeds. the aquaglow itself was bigger than i expected, and they sent me different colored tops (an orange and a yellow one) from the pictures they showed which is no big deal. unfortunately i don't think i'll be purchasing this product again, and i probably won't use it in my pool besides from when i tested it, but it's in my room as a colorful night light :)*also i paid like an extra 10$ for 1 day delivery cause i wanted to try it before my pool party, but i didn't expect to have to sign for it at delivery. i wasn't home when UPS came on friday, so i didnt get it til monday annnnd the UPS guy didnt even wait this time, they just left it on my porch --- i pretty much lost my one day shipping money and time but i guess that was my fault, but i just thought i'd throw that in there."
128573,0,Neither the coat nor pants have pockets. Also the coat could be a little longer to provide coverage during stretching.
353638,2,"This is the worst striker ever. In the product description it says this is made of ivory, but this is just a piece of plastic and even lighter and smaller than a regular striker. They cheated me really. It is not the striker they show in the picture. Never buy this product, you will hate it if you love to play carom. I even had to pay more than $10 with shipping.I'm totally disappointed with this product, Amazon!"
174913,0,"The stand has a stable base for holding the wheel, but the truing arm which the adjusters are screwed into is made from plastic. i expected it to be made of steel bar similiar to what my freinds is like. hopefully it'll be fine."
27770,2,Item did not survive one day. First gust of wind ripped the canopy and twisted metal legs. Obviously inferiorly made product. Not made in USA.
196405,0,"While these look like the stoves from the 70's and 80's they are much more flimsy. Get on E-Bay and find the white gas stoves from the 70's and 80's, the single burner 502's and the 220 and 228 series lanterns, they are much more durable, the old leather pump cuffs last much longer than the rubber ones. You can easily clean the old units up, repaint them if ness, and get them going each in about 1 day's spare time. Use PEERLESS mantles or TIMBER CREEK mantles in the lanterns, they are brighter and last longer than the modern coleman #21's. Check oldcolemanparts on google to find their site, and you can order replacement parts, and decals for your rebuilds. Articles in the FORUMS will tell you how to overhaul the generators so they will burn unleaded or white gas (easy fix) in the older units."
229806,1,"I purchased these for my son, he lived in Florida for about 13 yrs.,he had to move back home this past April, Because he lost his job. So I got him men's under armour to help keep him warm cause he is not use to winter here in West Virginia. It's been a big help it keeps him warm. Thank You."
344545,0,"I like everything about these pants except for the belt. Most football pants have the belt go all the way around the pants so you can adjust the waist easy, but these ones are stitched on. I had to end of fixing the stitch so my son could even wear them, or else they would keep falling off. Good quality material, but I do not thing I would ever purchase them again because of the belt issue."
111839,0,"Very nice just out of the box, but i wash it and put it on the dryer, came out with a little rip on the edge of the fabric, don't know what to think about this, maybe it was the regular cycle on the washing machine... other than that its pretty nice,it works!"

7230,1,"Made in America. Priced right. Perfect thickness and tight fit. Excellent for working out, yoga, pilates, around the house or even for layering. They are basic but they are not cheaply made or lacking quality.cons: I wish the color selection was better and that they made complementing tank tops, sports bras, shorts or calf length pants."
355598,0,"I bought one of these single-burner stoves to take on campouts and it has worked well most of the time. But the cheap price leads to some drawbacks: The knob came off after about the 6th campout (but was easily replaced from an electronics parts retailer); there's no carrying case and the cardboard box came apart after just a couple of trips; the wind screen/pot supports scratch the base when you install them, which leads to rust over time; the wind screen and fuel tank connector kind of fits inside the base, but not really, which makes it a bit awkward to pack up and carry. But, for the price, it works reasonably well."
15783,1,"This has to be one of the best bladders I've purchased. I wasn't sure about the handle, but after the first use I was very glad I went this route. There is a quick release for where the water line meets the bladder. Makes cleaning quick and easy at the end of the day. I also enjoy the magnetic clip for the mouth piece."

161886,2,"The rubberized coating began to deteriorate after a little over 2 years of use to the point where it stained my hands. I sent the binocs to Cannon and their estimate for repair was about what I paid for them new. They also accused me of causing the problem by getting some type of ""repellent or lotion"" on them. This was my response:The binoculars have never been exposed to any type of repellent or lotion or abuse of any kind and for you to suggest so is inappropriate. On the contrary, they have always been wiped down to remove any salt water spray before storing and have always been used with care. They have been kept clean and dry in a dedicated waterproof Pelican case. Neither of my other binoculars, a Steiner Marine nor a Nikon WP respectively have suffered the same issue and they have been exposed to exactly the same environment. I would not expect any $500.00 precision instrument to suffer this issue with typical use as your product obviously has. Your lack of customer service and recognition of an obvious, common flaw in your product has lost you at least one loyal customer and perhaps a few more as I will not recommend your binoculars to any of my boating friends. Please return the binoculars without repair."
372825,0,"I bought a size 14 first and it was molded larger than an average size 14 boot but very easy to get onto my foot at the ankle part of the boot. I then ordered a size 13 to see if it felt any better. Well first of all the boot had a different pattern on the rubber itself than the size 14 boot. Also it was very hard to get my foot into it because it was mold much, much, smaller at the ankle area. Although both boots are stamped with the tingley brand name, it seems as though they may have not come from the same factory due to the different mold pattern on the toe of the boot, and the different boot removal lug on the back of the heal."

164553,2,"Beware!! This coin is looks good on the one side, but have you ever seen the other side? There is a good reason you only see the one side and that reason helps the seller, but deceives the buyer. Side 2 is horrible looking, I thought when I bought this product that the other side was going to look like the front, but it doesn't. Since my bad purchase I have found better card guards out there that have both sides finished and are much higher quality. Just do your shopping and you will be glad you did. There are some other websites that I have bought from that have a much superior product and better prices."
297099,0,"Cute helmet holder for a NY Giants fan family. Only 3 stars as there are 2 things missing: a drainage hole at the bottom so that water can get out and not collect in the bottom; secondly, the opening is not wide enough for a battery operated toothbrush so it doesnt fit in all the way."
124942,1,"This is the best watch I've had for everyday use. Never need to adjust the time its always 100% accurate. Alarms work great and no need to reset them daily. Battery is always at full capacity. Cool feature for dark places, the watch can illuminate atomatically when you turn your wrist as if you were reading the time. That works great for movie theaters and such, and can be turned off at the touch of a button.I work in construction and I never take the watch off at work. It's been banged up, rubbed on brick and concrete, and hit with sharp edges. I've had days where I've had to use a chopping gun or a reciprocating saw all day (the vibrations would destroy a normal analog watch)and the watch is always fine. Its been filthy and sweaty from sheet rock and 100 degree days at work, but all it needs is a rinse with soapy water. I've had the watch for over three years and would definitely get another one or two. G-shock has a loyal customer for life."

15550,0,The card shuffler works as expected but it did not come with a tray to put in the slot to easily remove the cards after shuffled. We bought this shuffler to replace one we had but broke after we dropped it. Our original shuffler had a card tray and we expected the one we bought to have one too. I do not know if the tray was accidentally ommitted or was never intended to be part of the shuffler. If it was never to be then I am disappointed because the picture looks like there is a tray and not having one is very inconvenient and cheap. If I knew there would be no tray I would not have bought this shuffler.
6714,1,"Nice pants, generously sized - I often take a 36 waist, and the days of 34 are in the past... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two: a pencil/screwdriver shaft section plus the rest, which isn't quite big enough for a smartphone. Get a seam unpicker though, and you can turn it into one larger pocket that's ideal for a phone, complete with light velcro fastener at the top.All pants should have a phone pocket these days, preferably a subtle one."
418993,1,"The binoculars are pretty much what I expected. They are not the much better optically thanlower priced binoculars but are much better construction. They will take more punishmentI expect.

431186,1,"I've had my Jon E for 3 winters now. I always light it according to the instructions. light the starter wick beside the catalyst and let it stand for 1 minute. Blow out the flame. (From now on, there is no flame in the warmer.) put the top on the warmer, and let it sit for 5 minutes. It's ready to use. In my experience this warmer works very well. It does smell like lighter fluid when lit. It comes with a filler cup, and burns 7-8 hours on one fill. I put this warmer in my inner coat pocket or pants pocket and it's rarely gone out. It gets very hot so I always use the bag. You can control the heat a little bit by opening or closing the bag. If it's in a pocket, I leave the bag open so it can get enough air. To put it out, take the cap off and pop the catalyst off the body. It will go out in several seconds and wear gloves because it's hot. I'm very pleased with it and I've just ordered the giant version. I'll write a review when I've used it."

306461,0,"As advertised, this mat is thick and is comfortable when your weight is on your back, hips, or knees. However, it is slippery. The mat seems to be coated with a waxy type of material that does not improve after washing. Even after I soaked the mat in the tub, rinsed it off, and dried it, it was still slippery when I took it to yoga class. My hands slide in downward dog, and even my back foot feels like its sliding when I'm in warrior poses. Unless you don't sweat during yoga class, I would not recommend this mat."
253215,2,Just got it today. I was exited to mount it on. The bracket that holds the cage to the handlebars is not sturdy enough. Bought three cages for my wife and two sons two years ago. The brackets on all three are very sturdy. I believe They were sold by another vendor thru Amazon and did cost $ 7.00 a piece. This is cheaply made it's not worth buying it. To return it may cost more than it is worth. I guess I will trash it.

Twenty bucks was bad enough but to add more than 30% more to the overall cost??? Ok, so I did not think it through completely & wanted socks for my Yeti sized feet - shoot me.To add to my disappointment while waiting for these (should be) solid gold socks to be shipped, I was in Costco & found socks of equal quality & size (size 14 shoe) for just $9.95. Hmmm, lets do a little math - 16 pairs for the same overall price as 6 from this seller .... time to hit the control/alt/return keys on my laptop."

188425,2,"I bought this before going on vacation so I could keep my money on me while I was at the beach. It seemed to seal just fine when I tested it after receiving the product. However first time at the beach, my money got soaking wet. I tried it a second time just in case I did it wrong the first time, and again the seal just opened right back up again. It was a waste of money."

These are LABELED Stiga 1-star balls, at least that is what I received.They were in a Stiga BOX with Stiga tape sealing it.I'm happy with the purchase, but I think I may try the Gogo 3-star balls next time as they have a similar price."
164706,0,"I've had to use these running shorts along with my previous pair of too-short shorts. The Champion brand are great for wicking away sweat and keeping a tender body area dry however they are extremely see-through immediately upon putting them on! If I wear my black running shorts over these I get the best of both worlds, but for the price of these shorts I would prefer to only need one bottom that has thick enough fabric to not show off my underwear/skin."
151321,1,My other Casio watch finally quit working and was starting to look worn so I used the excuse of a bad battery to buy a new one. I'm a big fan of the value and style. My faverite feture of this watch is the light button on the front and it also has a feature that turns the light on automatically when you flip your writ up - how cool. You can't go wrong with this watch... Joe
213456,2,"I am a regular prime subscriber to Amazon. I do online shopping, dont like to shop in stores, etc....I order many many items online. Never, and I do mean, never have I experienced such stupid people as those employed by Speedo. I am reasonable, and fairly accepting, do not get upset easily. When the product arrived, it lacked some simple instructions for use to exercise. Just a little booklet, with 4 types of exercise. No big deal. Of course, it was printed in 4 languages. I just needed the English version. When I called Speedo customer service, I was told to mail the total package back. That it was IMPOSSIBLE to email me the manual. Keep in mind this is one sheet of paper. Not to mention the fact, that I paid an additional charge for overnight shipping of the barbells. When the little fool told me, she was quite polite, and very sorry. HOnestly, I dont want polite and sorry, I want service. I want the copy of the excercises to do. I then emailed them; that, in turn, was turned over to someone else. After 3 days, they sent me an attachment, I tried 3 different versions of software to open it. I emailed them back requesting---just scan it, one page, and email it to me. The next thing..they sent it in the wrong language. Right, they sure did. The next thing they sent, was the original, unable to open, and only two exercises. Again, keep in mind, this is a one page document. I still do not have them. I am just tired of their stupidity. NO review for i have not used them. No instructions."

Along with a change in my eating habits and the Callenetics program I was consistently asked....what are you doing? You look fantastic! Unfortunately, I allowed life to get in the way and did not continue with the program. I made up my mind to begin again. Found this dvd on Amazon and am on my way to being fit and strong again! I truly believe that Callenetic will work for anyone!"

165102,0,"This is a nice set, and Hoppes is a good brand. Still, for a universal kit, it ought to have brushes big enough more manly calibers such as .40 S&amp;W or .45 ACP. With this kit, if you have any handgun bigger than a weenie 9mm, it looks like you're out of luck."
160927,2,"I don't like giving bad reviews, but this is the first item I've ever returned to Amazon. Within 4 hours of setting this watch for the first time, it was already 3 minutes slow. The first night I slept with it on, I fell asleep around 11:45. When I woke up at 5 am, the watch had stopped at 12:15. Extremely stylish, though, and it has a very sturdy case."

You clamp your battery according to red and black color and plug it into the socket for a recharge. This product recharges your battery and that's it. The display lights show you whether your battery is ""charging"" or ""charged"". I made a mistake of thinking that this product can also be a power source (when recharged again) so I can use carry it on my boat in case my battery dies out and let the battery to draw power from it."
289645,0,"This board looks like something you could buy at wal-mart for the kids to play with in the pool, I bought one as my first board for the cold waters of gloucester MA because i knew i'd hardly ever use it annd there are no surf shops in that area. when i did find a shop with boards they were upwards of $600I now live in Huntington Beach CA, and I feel as if I'd get beat up if i dragged that board to the beach. HOWEVER.......I now call it the ""unbreakable loaner board"" and let my friends use it when they come here on vacation, it floats great, and is rather heavy which makes it super easy to stand up on, Its a great board to learn on if you dont mind being ridiculed by other surfers. its not worth 300 dollars though. ESPECIALLY not when you can get a used Merrick @ play it again sports for like 150 bucks"

75328,1,This game will give you an all new respect for the real drivers. This is not a game for the average driver. Even the beginner setting are more then a handful for me. I have both the 08 and 09 games and I do like the lay out and the caracteristics of the 08 game just a little better.
202560,2,I thought to myself why not drop $50 bucks on my first training broadsword. First of all you can get it directly from MartialArtsmart site for 5$ cheeper. I didn't lern this until after I ordered it through Amazon. Out of all of the broad swords I have seen to train with this one is the most flimsy. The only thing this sword is good for is to make the wiggle sound!! A wooden sword would have been a better sword to train with IMHO.I should have spent the extra $20 to get the Competition Broadsword. Yeah this one has a cool black scabberd and the carrying case it comes with rocks but blade is like a wet noodle.I don't reccomend you buy this sword and spend the extra 20$ for a stiffer sword.
208443,1,"I bought this at a sporting goods store for $99 about a year ago. Unfortunately I can't compare it to other trainers, but I feel that the total review score for this thing is inaccurate.Setting the trainer up was sort of difficult, I remember there being an awkward screw that had to go in a hole at a very specific angle. But, I can't remember much because once I set it up, it hasn't come apart. (No need to.) That's a good thing because you don't want your trainer feeling like it's going to fall apart after putting it together. It folds nicely for storage without having to take it apart.It comes with an axle you will need to use with your bike for it to fit on the trainer. That's kind of annoying, but again, I can't compare this to other trainers. (At least it comes with one!) It does not come with a stand for your front wheel, something to consider. (I picked up the Blackburn Trak Block bike stabilizer.)It has three resistance levels. You set up your bike. You ride on it. Indoors. $99 is a pretty good price for a bike trainer. I have seen name brand models (with more reviews) on Amazon with cheaper prices."
122422,1,"My husband and I purchased the Gazelle Power Plus for us to share. We have a small house and can only have one piece of equipment. I wanted a treadmill, my husband wanted an eliptical. We found this and agreed to give it a try. I think it's a good value for the money. It's a little on the large side, and dosen't fold up for storage (at least not easily that we can see) It works well so far. I work up a good sweat using this, so I think it's working. I can see that it might get a little boring, but exercise has never been a real passion of mine anyway. My husband and our 2 year old assembled it. It took about 2 hours (with the help of a toddler) It seems very sturdy. Overall, I'm satisfied with our purchase."
339300,1,I love this Pedometer. Just put it your pocket and go. I also bought the safety leash that is sold seperate because it has a medal clip. I recommend both.

346306,1,"So I've had my rack for about a year now. Usually, we load up our 2 bikes to tote to some of our favorite trails. We have had a few occasions to load 4 bikes, and it is very difficult...although not impossible. 3 bikes is fine, 2 is downright easy. The built in straps and cradles hold the bike on perfectly, with no fear of coming loose. And, after a year, there is no sign of wear and tear on the straps (I kinda wondered if they would withstand the test of time - so far so good). I had read that the bar that extends into the trailer hitch is too long for use with a Toyota 4Runner - that the bar hits the spare tire that is mounted under the trunk area. That was true. So, I cut off a few inches from the end - and it seems to work fine. I'm not sure, again, if that has weakened the unit, but time will tell. For now, it seems to be fine. The other problem I had was with the built-in locking strap. When the bike holding arms are in the vertical position (swinging down), the lock strap slips out of the end of the arm and drags on the concrete unless you remember to strap it up. I've done this 2x now - and let's just say it doesn't really lock anymore. I love, love, love the way it swings out, even fully loaded! It is so convenient to swing it away and have full access to the trunk area. So, all in all, I really like it. If I didn't have to modify it (and worry that I've somehow compromised the integrity of the unit) to fit my trailer hitch, I'd give it a 5-star rating...particularly since our normal usage is only 2 bikes. It's not really suited for full-time 4 bikes. Lastly, the unit is quite heavy and cumbersome for storing when not mounted on the SUV."
273648,0,you get what you pay for....the watch is simply too curved for my wrist. in profile it almost looks like a half circle. so this would be good for smaller bony-ier people.... but not a bigger 6'1 guy..its a simple inexpensive watch for wet locations

315098,0,"The half that's the allen screw is great. It can be used to attach road bike inner ring (grandma gear) and other uses. However, the part that's a nut doesn't have any strength. Buy these for the screw part (allen wrench fits) and discard the other part (outer jacket--no allen fitting).For use with double-rings, do keep the steel nuts from your oem set.Compared to FSA and Truvativ where both parts fit allen or torx and both are strong--well, this product is about half as useful as those."

447924,0,"The helmet does look oddly round from the front, which I don't care so much about. It's a helmet, it's not going to look cool. More importantly, the helmet is uncomfortable. The adjustment straps for the ""one-size fits all"" design get scrunched up on the interior of the helmet right on top of my head. You have to make sure to pull all of the straps out and then tighten it to fit your head. All of this seems normal, but other helmets can be adjusted and stay adjusted. The strap on this one always feels loose."

429690,1,"Bore snakes are wonderful. You can use them at the range if you want to stay a long time, out in the field as a quick clean for a battle rifle... the uses are nearly endless.The only maintenance required for bore snakes is occasional cleaning. You can see when they are dirty by judging the tarnish on the brass bristles. Tossing them in a 'delicates' bag (ask your wife about this) and placing them in the washing machine works very well.However... bore snakes are not intended to be replacements for the usual rod and patch method. For 12 gauge shotguns, use the rod, but buy up some Tampax Original Regular. When you fluff them out, they work perfectly as a patch for thoroughly cleaning a 12 gauge barrel. I found this excellent advice at the 'Box 'o Truth' website, and it turned out to be exactly what I needed for my own shotguns. They clean much more quickly and efficiently compared to regular patches."

112441,0,"Very nice just out of the box, but i wash it and put it on the dryer, came out with a little rip on the edge of the fabric, don't know what to think about this, maybe it was the regular cycle on the washing machine... other than that its pretty nice,it works!"
394613,1,"ok... so.... because you said probably i am going to assume you did not buy that gun, and therefore can't say anything about it that you don't know. because you didn't buy it.

370395,0,"I was expecting a lavender/fuschia/black plaid fabric, instead it was gray and black plaid with pink highlights. I would also classify this as a wheeled carry on piece of luggage, instead of a daypack, even though the straps can be fastened into place so you can carry it like a backpack. It's a bit cumbersome for everday use, but my elementary school student is using it with no complaints so far. One teacher commented that my student user looks like she's ready to board a plane."
127681,2,"This game is absolute garbage. I have nothing good to say about it. The controls are so messed up it seems like they spent about 4 minutes writing that part of the game. It finishes your full swing about half way through your back swing over half the time and gives really, really low power.When you do manage to do well in a tournament, it's all over if that was your first day. You can't win it. If you're in first place after the first day, the other golfers start having insanely good scores (usually around -16 to -18). If you get lucky and have a good first day, you are better off not saving the game - you'll never be able to beat those -16 to -18 scores the game thinks it needs to give your opponents.As everyone else has said, the graphics suck. Not just how poor they look at any given time, but the frame rates are terrible too most of the time.The sound is also horrid. I'm amazed they could get that wrong, but it seems that every golf course in the world is completely surrounded by hundreds of air ports and dogs. The commentators are equally annoying. If I made a mediocre shot (like getting within inches of the hole after a 55 foot putt) I doubt it's the ""worst putt"" you've ever seen. Good thing these morons can be turned off.I think it's clear that this game was rushed and that EA didn't bother to do ANY play testing at all before shipping this out the door (having the developers play-test doesn't count - I mean real testing with real gamers that don't know the game already).The tournament scoring thing is about the worst bug of them all. It's clearly intentional and it completely prevents winning first place if you do well on day one. No one finishes -18. The people in this game are finishing with 53, 54, or 55 as the norm. This makes Wayne Meyers' 57 at Southern Oaks look like a joke."
12625,1,Like the columbia fleece product they are soft. I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax. I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality.
335939,0,"I bought this treadmill because of it's high rating in Consumer Reports. I'll admit that, so far, I'm happy with it. However, I was dissapointed to learn that it was made in China. My experience with Chinese products has not been a positive one. Poison in dog food, toothpaste, pharmaceuticals, and sheetrock are just a few examples of why I am so lerry of Chinese products. Low quality and cheap components seem to be synonymous with ""Made in China"".I know it's unthinkable for America to build our own treadmills, but I would feel a lot more confident about my investment if it had been made in Japan or Germany. Time will tell."
454009,0,"My ""little golfer"" rec'd this for Christmas and loved it... until it broke. For the first 10 minutes it seemed to work properly. We were all extremely disappointed when the mechanism that rotates the holes in the center stopped rotating. The toy itself seemed too heavy for it. When upside down, it worked OK but turn it rightside again and no go. It totally died after the first day. If you're little one is into golf, it may be worth the six bucks to hit little putts. The golfers are cute and do actually swing at the balls. As for the fun of hitting it into the holes, forget it. Anyone over 5yo would be very disappointed."
102941,0,"Unfortunately, in my effort to to get my Christmas shopping done early, I ordered this item in November. My son did not like his watch, and I need to send it back.

The shower wasn't in that bad of shape, so we thought this would bring some life back to it. IT pretty much did NOTHING (which is better than it having done damage!). Wish I knew what product we could use to make that happen. Would love to hear some ideas!"
326656,1,"I bought this to feed turkeys and ducks and so far it is still hanging on the barrel. I had a Moultrie (sp?) and the coons chewed EVERY single support off - found it laying on the ground.

107681,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."

Yes, I weigh a bit more than I used to but I no longer carry a 15 to 35 pound pack and I do many less miles than in the past. At this sort of price, these socks should be a whole lot more durable.If anyone has a suggestion for a replacement, some other sock that has the same function but is a better value, please leave a comment. Thanks."
307070,0,"It shipped super fast but the box was in Japanese- so probably a knock off. It seemed a little small, and is very inaccurate. Neat toy but not worth it."
506555,2,this piece of crap broke after 20 short minutes bb`s got jammed in the barrel first (i used high quality 12 gram bb`s) then the hammer would get stuck when i`d pull the the trigger so this gun certainly isn`t elite (as the title says) this gun wasn`t even powerful or accurate it sucks just like the real thing (matter of opinion) buy at your own risk.
494829,0,"This shirt is not true to size, way to big for my son. I thought he would be happy about it but he says it's way too big for him. They are very comfortable to wear and easy to care for.

427807,2,"Tired of looking at my gut and troubled by arthrtis, I thought I'd try this workout. The music is just okay, the instructor is good. The excercises aggravated my back and knees. If you have AO beware! Even with modifications it's too much of a strain for me. After a month of following the diet and workout plan, I was disgusted to only lose 1.5 pounds. Shopping in walmart I saw a Taebo Celebrity workout for 9 bucks and change. After five workouts with the Taebo I've lost 4.5 pounds. AND I'm still eating dessert everyday. This workout is not at all taxing on my joints. Ya live and learn."
119891,0,"This Brewers lamp is hard to rate. I LOVE how it LOOKS, but the quality is just ok. It's a bit smaller than I pictured it would be. The lamp shade is connected to the base VERY poorly and after a few months the lamp shade already fell off, there is not a way to fix it, I'll have to take it in some where. So, because of the shade and having to deal with finding a place to fix it, I would have to say that I wouldn't have bought it (even though I still think it's the nicest looking one out there)."
191078,0,"In my ever humble opinion, the claws sit wrong when held. They curve out from your hand, instead of straight out like I think they should. Also the part where its made to look like the claws are actually coming out of your hand bites into the meat between your knuckles; making them painful to hold for longer then 2 minuets. Great for a Wolverine costume though, as most people that will see it wont know the difference. I strongly suggest finding a pair of gloves that look decent with them to minimize hand irritation."
333742,1,"first thing, it comes with all the zip ties you would need to mount it. also comes with all the mounting hardware you need.2 sets of data, so if you accidentally reset one of them, you still have another set, or if you're comparing 2 sessions of record.very informative instruction and easy to understand with diagrams."
61383,1,"I ordered two of them, the smaller 16 oz and the medium 22 oz. I love both of them and will be ordering more in other colors. If you put the top on correctly, it does not leak at all. Also, both of them happen to fit my car cup holders. The 16 oz is a little small but comes in handy for quick trips when I don't want to lug a heavier bottle around."

398135,0,"I got these for my daughter when she was about 2 years old, and that seems to be a fairly ideal age for these skates. Indoors they roll pretty well, making pulling her along fun, but on the sidewalk it's a nightmare. Now, a couple months shy of her 4th birthday, she's completely done with these since she sees our neighbor's kid whizzing by with real skates. The knee and elbow pads are nice, but also sized pretty small. I can't believe they advertise these for ages 3-6. Any six year old would tell you in no uncertain terms that these are ""baby skates""."
484206,0,"This workout attempts to update Callanetics, but I'm not sure they succeed.Is it a terrible workout? Not really. If you're looking for a hybrid of yoga, callanetics and pilates, it's not so bad.If you love straight up Callanetics, stick with the older, Callan-led workouts. Callanetics at it's core is very simple, and the older workouts tend to flow quite nicely, which really means that once you learn the moves, you should be able to work on your own without an instructor, book or dvd. It's all about working at your own level, at your own pace, nothing scary. If you're looking for Callanetics, I'd say to look at the original '10 years younger in 10 days' (an hour long), or the AM/PM (2 20 minute workouts, definitely doable as morning/evening workouts, it's most of the 10/10 workout spread into two workouts).In this 'Evolution' workout, three exercisers work simultaneously, each doing a slightly different level.There's not much in the way of guidance, so in order to know what to do, you have to really look at the screen and try to puzzle out what's going on. This is much easier for some moves than others. The transitions from one move to another don't always make sense either, and you won't know what's coming up based on the instructor. More than once I've had to stop the dvd, figure out what position to get in, get myself there, and then restart the dvd. This kind of thing really ought not to be necessary.There's a section that purports to give tips on proper form, but it's a discussion of theory and principles, not a step by step, here's how you do moves x, y or z.I do like some of the ideas for modifying the pulses, but again, the lack of proper cuing makes it impossible to figure out what to do unless you stop focusing on your workout and look at the screen.Given that the original Callanetics workouts were all about getting in to the proper position before doing the pulses and maintaining proper form throughout, easing gently back out, the lack of advice and structure here seems kind of sloppy.Some of the flow of the workout just seems odd, and in my view, if you want someone to do a particular yoga or pilates pose, use that name for it (cat, dog, downward dog, etc.) so people know what's expected.I'm assuming that some of this new 'Callanetics' is all about marketing, continuing the business Callan Pinkney began, but honestly, I'd have preferred an old-school Callanetics routine."

204160,0,"This rack will not work well if your car has a spare tire on the rear door, like my Rav4. The inner bike is very hard to fit on due to the space taken by the tire. I can squeeze the first bike on, but I have to remove the pedal. Like others who have noted damage in shipping, my rack also arrived broken. One of the tire support adjustment handles was broken off. I didn't think it was a big deal at first and I just tightened it with a wrench. But, when I went to mount a friend's bike, I realized the wheel supports needed to be adjusted to different bikes. I adjusted the other side, but it was a pain. Overall this is a good basic rack for the money, but I wouldn't recommend it if your car has a rear mounted spare tire that will interfere with the rack. Happy cycling."

65544,1,"I was VERY impressed when I pulled this helmet out of the box. I had tried a few on in Walmart and a couple of other places after I had purchased this one. When the helmet arrived it was every bit as good as the best one I saw at Walmart. Yes, that is not the highest-end retailer of bike helmets, but my point is that some of them are more expensive than this one and most are every-bit as expensive.The helmet fit is quite adjustable, but fit almost perfectly right out of the box for me. I ride in Tempe, Arizona, where it gets very warm in the summer. This helmet has excellent ventillation. I have to give it the highest rating possible because it is every bit as nice as I can imagine a bike helmet could get. I also appreciate the sun visor because it really does cut down on the light in my eyes. I still wear sunglasses, but it keeps the sun from shining directly into the sun glasses.This one came with an LED light on the back straps, just below the helmet, but far enough away from my head that I don't feel it. I was just informed via a comment that this helmet is not supposed to come with an LED. Perhaps I received the wrong helmet or my review link went to the wrong item. Personally, I wasn't expecting an LED light on the back, so it might have been a mistake. Honestly, the light is not important to me, I just thought it was neat."

360631,2,"I bought this remote with the understanding that it would be a remote on/off switch for my MoJo Mallard. The installation was a bit more difficult than anticipated, as it would not fit into the body cavity of the decoy as the battery has a small plastic box to house it. I had to remove the battery box completely (2 screws) so I had enough room in the cavity for the remote receiver could fit with the battery. With the battery box removed, I could now install the remote receiver into the cavity.To install the remote receiver, you first need to remove the wire-loop hook-up on the multi-pin connector. You then connect the remote. Caution -- the pins are not very secure and can wiggle out of alignment making it difficult to connect. Once connected, a green light will light up on the receiver, signaling a connection. You then need to reboot (clear the memory) the system by pushing the bottom of the receiver where the light lit up, for 5 seconds. You then need to press it again for 2 seconds, and then push the bottom on your remote control to sync the receiver to the remote control. Pack all the wires into the MoJo cavity, (Note -- I extended the wire antenna of the receiver out through one of the screw holes where I removed the battery box for better reception), and turn it on by pressing the on/off button on the bottom of the decoy.Here's where we hit the second installation speed bump. The remote would only slow the wings down -- they would not turn off. Fast or a little bit slower was the result.Frustrated, I contacted MoJo directly, and they offered to have the Remote Kit returned to them, and they would replace it Free of Charge. So off to the Post Office I went.As of this writing, I have returned the kit to MoJo Outdoors, and am waiting on the replacement kit. I will update this when I get it installed."
483587,0,"The concept and medium size of this inflatable was great! But, the seams between the sections is not strong enough to handle normal use from children. I began repairing tears after the first day of use. It now has 6 patches after 2 weeks of use and headed for the trash can. Also, the pillows were not a good idea. One child tore off a pillow causing a 12"" tear and thus resulting in cutting off the whole upper section. If durability was better, this would be a five star toy."

344838,0,"It's not expensive, I give it that, but the plastic is way too thin where screws tighen, especially the backboard. And the base HAS to have some weight either on it or in it, otherwise it can tip over very easily due to the inherent in-balance. The rolling wheel mechanism should also be secured by bolts and nuts instead of a shaft rolled into grooves. Otherwise it does its job, but never try to hang onto the hoop, the whole thing will break. I didn't bother to fill the base with water or sand and simply placed something heavy on it, but one time it was removed by accident and the stand fell forward. The V-shaped bracket behind the backboard promptly broke free from the bolt/nut secured to that thin plastic wall of the backboard. My mistake, but really wish it is built with higher grade material, or reinforce the nut area better or simply add thickness around that area."

They have an opaque yellow color right out of the bag. This is purely cosmetic, but adds to the disappointment of the product overall. On the treadmill, they are just average feeling. Not worth a premium over any other sock."

350486,0,"I chose this watch over the other Casio atomic solar watches because it didn't have all the extra digital dials and doo-dads on the face that make the watch more difficult to read. Despite its size, it's very light and comfortable. Unfortunately, it doesn't synch very well. It only synchronizes its time successfully every couple of months, and because of that, the Auto DST functionality is useless. Also, it doesn't hold its charge very well. It's supposed to get a full charge in 5 minutes of sunlight, but I've found it takes about 20 minutes in direct sunlight to fully charge. It doesn't seem to get a charge from indoor light at all. The owner's manual says that the battery has to be replaced after a few years. What's the point of having it be solar then? A regular quartz watch battery lasts that long. It also doesn't have a countdown timer, which would be really useful for parking meters, laundry, cooking, and the gym. Aside from that, it's ok, but I think Casio has a way to go in improving their synchronization and solar power functionality."
461651,0,"Great design and build quality (minus the rubber feet). Extremely heavy-duty although as the instructions state, you wouldn't want to sit in the middle of any of the aluminum ""bed-rails"".The fabric is tighter than a drum (at least right now that it's new). The ""hammer-handle"" (leverage) trick works great to get the 4th, even the third corner in place (note: A smooth handle such as hard-wood works better than a sticky handle such as rubber).Very comfortable for my 6'1"", 185 lb. frame. It's like laying on a very firm trampoline (i.e. heaven).Now to the rubber feet.THINK CLOWN SHOES AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY I TOOK OFF TWO STARS.That's because the rubber feet do not sit flush with bottom of the steel legs and the rubber feet buckle/crack (the steel legs ARE cut at the proper angle to sit flush with the floor).I ended up salvaging as much of the rubber feet as I could and then custom-fitting them to the legs. I used scissors to form-fit the rubber feet to the legs and eight layers of duct-tape to fasten them (really quite elaborate...should last for decades). The cot will now sit flush on the floor of my tent without tearing it.Bye-bye fragile air mattress with no easy way to level...hello XXL cot!And although it's possible, two people would be REAL cozy!"

495387,1,"I ordered the Nikon ProStaff rimfire 4x32 (black) and a Bushnell Banner 4x32 at the same time. I had purchased Nikons primarily in the past, but have recently added a few Bushnells based on a local gun store's recommendations. Leupolds give me more of a parallax problem than these brands, but that's likely my eyesight. I have a Ruger 9mm carbine that came with a very low-end Tasco scope that I've tolerated too long. I recently bought a Sig 522 and wanted to put a close range .22 scope on it. I bought both to do a comparison, then decide which (if either) would go on each gun. Both scopes are about the same dimensions. Neither poses a mounting problem. The Nikon comes with the rings, the Bushnell doesn't. The Bushnell is every bit as bright and clear as the Nikon--for about $30 less. Both adjust well for focus (mid-age eyes here) but the Nikon has a ring that backs up against the adjusted eyepiece to lock it in place. Eye relief really isn't much of an issue with such low powered firearms. Still, the Nikon gives about three generous inches of relief.The sighting reticle on the Nikon is not specified in the Amazon ad. This seems to be a problem with most of the lower end scope descriptions on Amazon. Mine came with the multi-X reticle (sideways X that thins near the center). This is a fine reticle for .22 work (or my 9mm carbine). The .22, much more than the 9mm in my comparison of scopes and carbines, wants a precise view to plink or hunt small game. I prefer the multi-X for this.I like the Bushnell and I'm keeping it (and reviewed it at the same time as this). It's on the 9mm carbine. The Nikon positively locks the eyepiece and the 522 gets handed between eager family members and friends but comes back to me unaltered. The Bushnell gets twisted (adjusted) easily for everyone. (Can you see who would like either and why? One of the two may be an advantage to you.) The Nikon's included scope mounting rings dilute the $30 savings on the Bushnell some. The provided lens covers came with one cap ""chipped"" so that a piece of it about 1/4 the size of the cap was loose in the bag around the scope. I couldn't see any signs of damage but I wondered if it had been dropped at the factory (as the unit was sealed, yet had this slight damage). If it was dropped, there was no negative result in the scope. But it does make pause a little to think that the quality control is not a better than to include a broken piece--even if it is small. (The box had no damage and the packing was very good so it most likely happened in pre-packaging.) I like the Nikon better, all things considered. But my study of each reminded me to look at other brands of scopes in a similar price range before settling on one. If you're not new to scopes, you may already have a favorite brand and hesitate to stray. But if you're newer--or new to the value segment of the scope market--you won't be embarrassed by these (even if you have a Bender and Schmidt on your custom silhouette tack-driver)."

509826,2,"I must agree with the previous poster. I've only had my Kettler stepper for six months or so. The first few weeks went great. I used it for 20-30 mins a few times a week. I began to notice that after 15 minutes I could smell a burning smell. It turns out that the pistons under the pedals were heating up from friction so much that smoke was coming off of the machine. Then, the machine began to squeek and crunch loudly as I progressed beyond a 15 minute workout. After using the machine for longer intervals, like 30 to 50 minutes, the plastic cap under the pedal on the left side popped off rendering the machine useless. I snapped the plastic cap back on again but it keeps popping off every ten minutes. This is a huge interruption during a workout (having to stop every ten minutes to service the machine). I am terribly dissapointed with the performance of this machine. I bought it because it is compact and I thought sturdy. Boy was I wrong! Be leary of this machine!!

The mat is thick, which definitely increases comfort, but it is also a very dense material. That means it isn't so soft as to decrease stability which is very important in balance poses.I've read claims that the material is odorless. I've found this not to be true. However, the smell is light and I expect it will fade over time. I personally do not find the smell annoying or distracting but it might be a consideration for people with known sensitivity issues.Due to the length and thickness of this mat, it is heavy. This could be an issue for those who want a mat that is easy to transport. I commute by bike whenever possible, and even though I'm tall, fit and reasonably strong, I notice this thing stuffed in my messenger bag! But hey, let's just consider that part of the workout.

The lanyard is very thin and lightweight which help keep the total weight down to just 9 grams! Do no forget to melt the ends of the nylon lanyard to avoid fraying over time since this may weaken the already thin lanyard.

He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."

79355,1,"4 1/2 stars.GYMS VS HOME:Gym memberships meant having to drive somewhere, waiting for machines, gawkers and gym rats, sometimes smelly environments, showers/lockers/changing rooms, hauling shower/dressing accessories, bringing home foot fungus, and over-all just that extra time/inconvenience that ultimately meant we'd never go. Waste of $$$. With this at home, we just jump on, get it done, shower/dress/etc quickly, privately and safely when we're running short on time. All of which means we work out more consistently.PRICE:Even the cheaper membership fees for two ppl ($40/mo each=$960/yr) will break even on this within the year. We're planning to add a treadmill or eliptical next year to round out the cardio (for now, we're enjoying jogging the surrounding neighborhoods).This is an awesome all-around system for the price. Ours isn't an ""APEX"", but it looks exactly the same (probably the same manufacturer, just different distributor - ours is a ""Total Sports America 5820"" from a few years back) except for this bench looks slightly improved.CONSTRUCTION:I don't find this to be that rickety. The pulley beam is supported with a cross brace to the side/supports to create the 'cage', and when tightened properly is quite sufficient for an average home user. Of course, If you're lifting/dropping 200-300lbs on it every day, perhaps it could loosen quicker.But, the construction and layout is much better than the cheaper units. The separate bench from the main 'cage' is a great feature.PULLEY:The pulley system could be better, which is why i deducted 1/2 star. Doubtful you would notice it if you have more than 20 lbs on the pegs. And perhaps they've got better systems on the newer/other models. (Ours is plastic coated stiff wire cord.)BENCH:This bench looks slightly different than ours, and perhaps better. But to be aware: The adjustable back lock knob on ours requires unscrewing and screwing back in to adjust/lock it in different positions. (A tight spring loaded pull-pin type system would be much better.) Our seat also rocks side-to-side a little due to the pivot joints needing to be loose enough to move freely for the sliding block adjustment mechanism. Luckily, not distractingly or dangerously. Again, all this may be updated/altered on this/other models, but something to consider.FREE WEIGHTS (Sold separately, I believe):Get creative with the free-weights you buy/use, and you can cover anything you used to do in the gym ... barring the pool/sauna, of course. But you can use your community center (often cheaper too) if you want those."
485038,1,"This is a great kit for people just getting into solar power and don't know exactly what they need. We don't get 60 watts with ours, more like 40. We live in Ohio where there isn't an abundance of sunlight though. However, that is enough to run our radio w/ CD player that says it takes 1.6 watts and/or our 3 LED lights w/ 4 bulbs each that take 9 watts and still keep charging the marine battery it is all hooked up to. We'll have to get more panels or a kit to make our own panels in order to run our internet router or antenna or to charge laptops, etc, very efficiently but we've learned so much using this kit and didn't need to buy ANYTHING in order to set it up and start using it except the battery. I would recommend this for anyone needing a little power at a remote cabin or to use in case of a power outage to run their radio and small things like LED lights or possibly electric tea pots and the like. Though I'm not real sure how much they require to run. It's also helpful you can add to this system if you need to. We haven't had it long enough to see how the plastic stand holds up but it isn't very sturdy looking. I imagine that it will eventually dry out and start to crack. We'll just weld a metal one hen the time comes though."

445260,0,"Pros: protects you from rain, supposedly windproof (haven't tested the windproof yet).Cons: Very poor handle for a 30 dollar umbrella. The handle is too small, which is saying a lot since I am only 5'7''. The umbrella is as big as a normal sized umbrella, and a little bulkier as it is kinda double layered. The material quality doesn't particularly seem like it's any better than a 15 dollar umbrella.Overall, this is a solid medium sized umbrella. Except for the windproof factor, there isn't anything really special about this umbrella, which is disappointing, cause 30 bucks is a lot for a umbrella."

Highly recommended!"
328324,0,"As a fine scale modeller, I've learned that Revell kits tend to be more geared toward beginners. That opinion holds true for this particular kit as well: it's generally inferior to the Tamiya (1/350 and 1/700 scales) and Hasegawa (1/450 scale) kits, and has many flaws: inaccurate decals, insufficient painting instructions, and poorly proportioned parts (many are far too thick, even given the limits of styrene casting, and my deck was warped significantly). The 1/535 scale is absurdly eccentric: there literally aren't any other kits in this scale, much less aftermarket parts (like photoetched railings). That said, it's cheap as heck, and simple to build, making it perfect for a beginner. The historical value of this ship was done imo insufficient service; I'd expect a kit to have more than a single page factsheet that focuses only on the Japanese surrender. Beginners, keep in mind: paint and glue are not included."

450043,0,"Pros - Assembly was easy and fast. Rack is rock solid. Doesn't wobble or sway in transit. Rack swings out far enough for truck tailgate to come down. Unloading camping gear with bikes in rack was a breeze. Security cable is a plus!Cons - The rubber straps aren't permanently attached and don't lock in to their starting position easily. They Lost one right away. Order an extra set. Also- order the quick attach locking bolt. The bolt for the neck of the trailer hitch means you need a rachet set or wrench every time you want to take the rack off. The lock for the security cable is not included.This was our first rack. We are ""occassional"" users. (Car camping, local bike trail, etc.) Good rack for us. If you are hauling women's or girl's bikes order the mounting adaptor. Adaptors much less expensive online. We didn't order them with the rack. Rookie mistake. Wish the instructions had some pointers on best way to mount four bikes.Overall - Great value!08/25/2008Just came back from a weekend camping trip.

When I compare what we got for what we paid to what they got to what they paid... we definitely got the better value!!"
99362,0,"Pretty short review. The bike is nice for the price, however the sizing is weird. I am a 5'10"" male with about a 31"" inseam, yet this bike I could barely get on.

440289,0,"If you don't know better, these probably seem like an improvement over the cheapest karate scrubs available, but compared to quality middle-weights, these really do seem like cheap lightweights. I wanted to replace some quality middle-weights that use a drawstring with something equivalent with this type of waist band. In that regard, this type of waistband is much more comfortable than a drawstring alone. Another plus is that they have a back pocket. Their saving grace is that they only cost about $20.On the downside, as I alluded to, compared to real, quality middle-weights, these are thin, light and abrasive, being partially synthetic. They're more of a middle-ground between real middle weights and light weights. Additionally, unlike a lot of other quality pants, they lack any fastener for the pocket. So don't put anything in it if you're training (not that you should anyway).It's a ""for the money, they're decent"" thing."

365361,0,"Overall this is an okay karate uniform. The material is light yet feels robust and the stiching is good. However, beware of the drawstring pants as there are good size slits in the hips which can expose ones underwear. If one is skinny it may not be a problem, otherwise decorum necessitates safety pins or a sewing job."

440379,0,"These are decent pants. The wide elastic band is very comfortable. I had to modify the length and bell of the pants as they are a bit ""disco"" for my taste. The price for the pants is good, but the shipping and handling charge is excessive and a bit slower than other companies."
60570,0,"I thought that the shorts were going to be small on me, a 4x, but after wearing and washing only once the material became softer and actually became larger, a perfect 4xl. I know that some reviewers do not like the length, but I perfer it. The waist band is heavy duty and well sewn. The draw cord is of good material and heavy duty as well. I would buy more than three pair but I think that they will wear so well, I will not need another for a very long time.Update 2/15/13I received the other two pair that I mentioned in the opinion above. Well, the athletic shorts are not the same as the first pair. The material is of lessor quality, the waistband is of lessor quality. At the price I paid for them, they are worth the money, but the first pair are a much better buy. In today's world things change quickly, this change is a sour note."
282403,1,This item is constructed very well. Purchased this item for personal training and self defense classes i teach. Compared to other items this one was very affordable and was alot thicker.

30528,2,"I have other Topeak products that are of high quality, but this went into the trash after numerous attempts to properly mount it. Followed all instructions but the flimsy little cable that is supposed to hold the basket from sliding down doesn't work. First, it slips a lot. When you tighten it, it easily frays from the holding screw. Finally, just when you think you got it positioned and tightened properly, the stub on the other end goes through the weak plastic hole in the bracket that is supposed to hold it (metal being held by a plastic retainer = bad idea).So we called Topeak and got a new wire sent to us. Same problem within 10 minutes. I suppose the basket works great if you keep it empty. We gave up and threw this piece of garbage out."

It would be way too small for my 6 foot 3 husband. The product itself seems to confirm my sizing suspicions - it comes with a measuring tape that you are supposed to use to check the diameter as you inflate the ball. Even once the ball was filled to its maximum capacity, there was still about a foot left on the measuring tape.Oh - and we found the pump to be pretty crappy - I can't imagine it lasting for more than 3 inflations."
428466,1,"Just got back from a cub scout camping trip. We had to park in a parking lot and haul the stuff to the camp sites, anywhere from 200 to 600 yards from the parking lot. This thing is perfect. It hauls a whole camp set up, tent, chairs, sleeping bags, clothes bags, everything. The big wheels go over dips and roots easily. The frame is very light and folds completely flat, the wheels come off with the turn of a toggle, packs small in the back of the van. Pop the wheels on, load up the gear, strap it down and go. Of course it rained. Got home, hosed off the mud and put it in the garage. Perfect, ready for next time. I'm a happy camper."

369542,0,"First, the good. For many years I tried just about every sharpening system out there. The early ceramic rod sharpener that had only one fixed angle for sharpening, the one with only one ceramic rod and a spring with a plastic guide that worked by moving the knife up and down, the small sharpeners that had two pieces of steel that worked by pulling the blade in the ""V"" formed by the steel, and finally, the venerable Sypderco Sharpmaker.There were also many purchases of regular bench stones, but these require skill in maintaining a constant angle, either by look or feel, and I eventually learned that I was ""angle challenged.""The Sharpmaker is a good sharpening system and I regard it highly. The only ""problem"" is that the system only gives you two choices for the sharpening angle: I think it's 30 degrees and 40 degrees (I'm not positive so verify if you're considering buying that system. It's a very high quality, well-thought-out system if you plan to sharpen only at those two angles.As I became more interested in knives and wanted to sharpen at angles less than 30 degrees, I decided to try the DMT Aligner system. For the first time, I began to produce edges that were very, very sharp. I use a Sharpie marker to coat the blade and then sharpen a few strokes to see how close the selected Aligner angle is set. The freedom to choose a variety of sharpening angles, combined with the very effective different DMT diamond stones, is really great. Now it's actually fun and easy to sharpen knives. And the half-round sharpener (available as an extra component that must be purchased separately from the kit) works great on concave blades. Highly recommended if you have knives with concave edges.Now for the bad. The part that clamps the blade, which also houses the two plastic guides that set the angle, is made of cheap, flimsy plastic that breaks easily. I've had the kit for two weeks and I've already broken the one that came with the kit. Luckily, replacements for this part only cost about $12, so my advice is to buy the kit AND an extra blade clamp. I just purchased two so I will have an extra when the next one breaks. Maybe DMT will eventually come out with a more durable clamp, but for now we're stuck with the flimsy plastic model.All in all, the DMT Aligner is a good sharpener at an affordable price and I will continue using it. For its price, it's a very good value."

146876,0,"Although this is a good accessory to have i wouldn't recommend it over the Ear Bud/Mic for skiing, especially if you wish to conceal it. I used one for half a day under my ski hat and goggles. While comforatable with just the hat as soon as the goggles are placed over it the strap squezes the ear piece against the ear which became increadably painfull after a while. Another draw back with this is that if another person is talking and you talk/laugh or breath heavily against the boom it cuts out the other person. Which can be very anoying. It also takes a while to cut in when you talk so you have to repeat yourself or say something prior to the message you actually wan't to give. One reason this accessory would be good to have is if you needed to use your radio while both your hands were being used (like riding / Manual Labour/Climbing) as with the earbud you need to be able to press the PTT button."

85015,0,"Understand that ""Blue LED"" means just that: ""Blue Light-emitting diode."" LED's are not lasers; chances are the last LED you saw was in a button-battery-powered keychain light. Even if this included LED is a larger, more powerful LED than average, it is at best a blue flashlight with a lens to focus it forward, it's not a laser pointer.On the upside, that means it doesn't really matter if its angle is a bit off your actual aim--it's there for illumination, not precision.If your favorite feature about the xm8 is its appearance, but you can't find an xm8 with the features you want (example: this one is a springer and you might want automatic), consider getting a g36 instead.(or g36c, etc.) The xm8 is so similar to the g36, some companies sell the outside parts to let you convert your g36 into an xm8.So you can find a g36 variant with the features you want, play with it enough to see if the performance is good enough for you, then either sell it off or buy a compatible conversion kit to make it look like the xm8 you always wanted."

503935,1,"I gave this pole to my wife for Christmas, so other than using it briefly on the hills around our house, I can't evaluate the durability, but she and I agree the feel of the handle is great and it performs the basic function of a hiking pole - stability - as well as more expensive poles. Length adjustment is easy and the locking mechanism secure. The snow disc, thermometer, and compass are nice bonuses that we probably won't use too often. I thought I'd spend 2x or 3x more for a pole of this quality. Compared to my more expensive hiking pole from a big outfitter (and others I've used), the Hammers HP5 is just a tad heavier, adjustment isn't quite as smooth (but it does collapse a bit shorter which is nice for transport), and it lacks a camera attachment in the handle; but at this price point those are all very minor quibbles. For the casual hiker seeking additional stability on rocky and steep trails, for steam crossings, etc, the Hammers is a great investment."
316883,0,"This is another well made Arc'teryx product. The fleece makes a great layer for warmth when used with a shell and is well designed. The fit seems a bit large for a medium (I'm 6' and 165lb and it fits a bit loosely), but that's typically true of Arc'teryx.I guess I didn't give it 4 (or 5) stars because it is extremely simple for the amount of money it costs. I have several Arc'teryx products (backpacks and jackets) and have always found the high price has been worth the quality of product I get, but I found the trade-off to be lacking here. There seems to be nothing that makes this fleece standout from other fleeces in the higher-end outdoor clothing market, yet it is priced significantly higher. I've seen fleeces made from other companies such as Patagonia that would undoubtedly do the same job functionally, but look and fit much nicer - all for at or below the price of this fleece. I guess for this price, I expect a bit more."

It would fix itself for a couple seconds and then it would work, but after about a minute or so, it froze completely and I couldn't even fast forward or anything. I took out the dvd to see if it was dirty or had scratches and it looks fine. I put it back in and tried to play it, and it was still stuck and freezing. I don't think it is my dvd player, because I use it on a regular basis and it has never done that before. I'm not really tech-savy, so I have no idea what the problem could be."
274434,1,"I own two of these,one for each of my recurves.This works great.It is difficult to get on at first so be patient.If you have a take down remove your bottom limb to install.I highly reccomend this as it offers great protection for a good price"
369474,1,"These are rather lightweight, but the fabric feels very sturdy. I'm a big guy (6ft 315lbs) so I was a little worried about the sizing. I wear a 48"" blue jeans and these were a little tight (not uncomfortable) around the waist. I could have skipped the belt and they would have stayed up. They're not too noisy, but I've owned quieter pants."
288864,1,My mom bought it for them and they loved it. Its really a great gift
501721,0,"Not as comfy as the Cudas Women's Havana Flip Flop Sandals. These flips flops have a raised arch, which sits too snugly on the arch of my foot. Sizing is fine, and I really like the patterned bands."
104650,0,"I have actually ordered this same rack before, Very impressed with quality and found set-up took about 1/2hr: pretty simple. UNFORTUNATELY this second rack arrived in a box that looked tampered with and indeed was. Missing many of the screws on the plastic card. looks as though this left the warehouse this way. Did call company and am waiting on new screws. Will update when and if they arrive."
473416,1,"Great mat, because it is really thick! I've used it many many times and it has retained the cushion. Great quality for a good price!"
128995,0,"I get cold easily. At home sitting, outside, running, whatever, I get cold. I have owned coldgear in the past and has good results, felt warm in cooler without ever getting overheated. However, the ones I used to have didn't keep me warm when it got below say 45 degrees or so. I needed a new pair, so bought this ""Frosty"" pair that supposedly would keep me even warmer than my last pair.Not so. These don't keep me particularly warm. They are thinner than my other pair, and I feel like the wind cuts right through them. Granted, I don't jog anymore due to a neck/back injury, but I fast walk, which in my experience, warms me up as fast and as well as jogging ever did. It was only 55 degrees out this morning, but humid here in the Seattle area. Maybe it was the humidity, it was kind of ""misty"" out. Someone from Seattle or a cool and humid place like it might know what I mean, it was cloudy, not raining, but the air had definate moisture in it that gets your clothes damp and condenses a little on your skin. Not sure if that matters, but I felt a damp chill as the light wind hit me. I was shivering within minutes and did not get warm thereafter. Like I said, I do get cold easily, but I feel since these are rating for colder temperatures than I am usually out in here in Seattle, I feel like they should have kept me much warmer than they did. They are very thin, not as thick as my last pair, and I felt not thick enough to block wind at all.The fit was better than my last pair though. I don't have thin ankles. I have big achilles tendons from year sof playing soccer (so I'm told) and finding boots or hiking boots is a challange, because everything is too tight in the ankles. My last pair of coldgear tights were WAAAY too tight in the ankles, so much so that I had to pulled them down over my feet or I got deep red marks on my ankles and stuff started to go to sleep down there! The ankle elstic on these in tight enough to keep the tights in place but not so tight as to be at all uncomfortable. Another thing, though, while putting them on, and I did not pull hard at all, the seams on the legs and hips popped when the fabric stretched even the tiniest bit. I can't see any split seems or anything, but i can't imagin from the amouth and feel that there aren't broken stitches just waiting to come apart. I stopped and intead of pulling from higher up on the calf, i first pulled the elastic over my foot, them sort of scrunched the legs up, but still I kept hearing those popping noises from the seems, and when I got to the hips, I had to pull to get them up the rest of the way, and winced at more popping. They were long enough for my 33.5"" legs, which I like. My last pair was too short, and since I had to pull the ankled down over my foot, they kept falling down, so that aspect was a plus.One other thing. I don't really care about compression, so that wasn't a consideration when purchasing, but in case it matters to some others, I felt zero compression in these tights, and i was careful to order the correct size.Overall, the fit is comfortable, and the length was great, but I just didn't feel like these tights were sturdy or warm. I need a wind breaker on top I think to make them warm enough, and I think there's a good possibility I'll need a sewing machine at some point."
154465,1,"I feel like there are already too many reviews of this product, my extra contribution of praises seems moot. However, I will say since I received my combo cooker, I haven't used any other pan. I love them a little too much. Sometimes I say 'Gooood Joooob' in a mothering voice after creating some kind of food masterpiece in them. I was worried about the extra care but I actually don't mind at all, in fact sometimes it feels like less care since you don't reeeeeally have to wash them. All in all I am very in love with my new children. They are so obedient and trustworthy, I could never see myself going back to some Non-stick, Teflon, delinquent pan."
205202,2,I purchased the SIGG aluminum water bottles to be more environmentally friendly; however I just learned stainless steel is the better material of choice. Aluminum although light weight has to be lined with something to make sure the contents are safe for drinking. Usually it is lined with baked on epoxy (toxic) or ceramic (can crack). I have also heard aluminum toxicity has been linked to many health conditions.
305102,0,"As of right now, the picture they have for Acai (purple) is actually the Coral (orange). So instead of getting the orange mat like I wanted, I ended up getting a purple mat :( So if you're ordering, make sure in your cart that you have the right color. So Acai is purple and Coral is orange.Customer service is emailing me a return label, so I'll be returning the purple for the orange soon. I'll come back and re-rate this mat for what it is once I get the right mat."

245560,2,I wear xxx clothing but both Russell Athletic items were too small I barely got them on. It seems that it's sized wrong.
351390,1,The shipping was prompt and the product is exactly what I wanted. It is good quality and will keep me warm all winter long!
37032,2,"These shorts come with a non-standard 8"" inseams that will likely not fit anyone who is ordering their waist size if they wear a 10"" inseam. In fact, I have a few Columbia shorts and the standard size for the inseam is 10"" on all of them (mind you these were off the rack at Columbia stores, in their standard sizes). 10"" also happens to be the size that is advertized on the site, although now it says 8"" and 10"" inseams, without the option of choosing which one you will receive.I have asked Amazon to replace the items since they claim that the 10"" size is available and will see how it goes. However, I would recommend that you stay clear from these shorts since they will likely not fit, unless you know an 8"" inseam is the correct size."
393772,0,"Assembly of the product wasn't bad -- instructions made sense, didn't need a lot of space to assemble it, and it only took 30 minutes (while slightly distracted).There is decent resistance offered and the seat glides smoothly enough -- it performs well given its low cost.The information presented by the computer is perhaps of limited use, but for many people, that may not matter.Everything about the product was fine, with one exception that made it practically unusable for me: the foot pedals. The pedals are a bit oversized, but that's not the issue. When you pull yourself forward, your feet tend to slip downward; unfortunately, the lip at the bottom/back of the pedal is so small in height that your shoe can easily slip past it, and right out of the velcro strap which is only at the top of your shoe.I contacted Stamina Products, but they had no solution to offer.Fortunately, someone posted user photos on this Amazon page, which provide an easy way to resolve the situation. Simply drill two small holes at the bottom/back of the pedal, and use a long shoelace on each pedal to tie your shoe ""down"" to the pedal -- once the shoelace is threaded through the pedal, bring it over top of the tongue of your shoe and tie it. It works very well, even with a lot of strain and without having to tie the shoelace very tight.With this improvement, the product works very well. If it had only had that out-of-the-box, I'd give it 5 stars."
221813,1,"This exercise ball is great and the quality is very good but go a size or two up. I ordered the green one, 65cm, and I am returning it to get the silver, 85cm. I am 5'6 and it just wasn't large enough, even at full capacity."
60612,1,"I am very pleased at the performance of these binoculars at this price point. I recently compared them side by side to some really high dollar Zeiss binoculars and yes there is a difference. But the difference in dollars is way, way larger than the difference in the view. Throw in free shipping and no tax and you can't beat it."
472640,1,I bought 2 Eagles dart boards for Christmas presents! I was so happy with the quality and the look. The darts with the Eagles emblems were a hit.

165507,1,"I got my first pocket knife when I was eight. A small Case brand. Have always had a pocket knife in my pocket, except when taken from me at an airport on many occasions. This smallest of the line Victorinox has been on my key ring for years. I don't have to sharpen them, because they always take it from me at the airport after which I buy another. Friends have their EDC (every day carry) knives. Big ones, medium ones, no small ones. I'm thinking their flick open self defense knives will never be used except for wearing a hole in their pockets. Mine, I come to the rescue for everyone around me. Sure, I can cut that string. I can open that package, I can make it easy to open the packet of soy sauce. All stand in disbelief as I come to the rescue. However, I am a little upset that they do not comment on my mask and cape. Most recently I had to help my Dr open a sterile package. I did wonder if I gave myself a new disease or perhaps spread something everywhere beyond the reputation of the Victorinox Classic."

197266,0,"I love the fact that these bands come in various strengths. That's about the only plus I can give them.In the future, if I decide to spend $10 on rubber bands, I need to make sure that they will never break. I told myself ""these other reviewers must be stretching the product too much."" Nope. After 3 days of use, probably 2 hours total usage each day, the white one snapped. Granted, I was using the same one the entire time, but I still feel as though the band snapped before even a reasonable amount of use.I would not recommend that you buy this product at the price I did. $10 is too much for rubber bands. If they hit $5, go for it. Having bashed the product's durability, I will say that they do provide an excellent work out for your hand muscles. My forearm was burning the day after I got my set. They totally do what they are supposed to do, they just don't last as long as they should."
403211,0,I did extensive research on which socks would keep my feet warm in the winter. These do the job. They are very comfortable and always want to wear them in cold weather. The problem is they don't last. After only 4 months (Through Winter) they wore thin and this caused holes.
275678,0,This pod is just okay. Nothing terrific. I am comparing this to a 20 dollar UTG model that I purchased a few months ago. This inut is not ready to connect to a picatinny rail. You will need an adapter for that. I could have purchased 4 UTG pod at different lengths that mount directly to a picatinny rail and they also come with the adapter to connect to a traditional rifle strap eye. Would not purchase this again- too expensive for what it is.
492296,2,"I an very displeased with this product. I gave it to my grandkids for Christmas and 1 week later it was broke. The ""Joy Stick"" will move in all the axis but no screen movement isseen. Is is not well made."
308953,2,"Let me start by saying the company I bought this from was fast at sending my order out. I did not try to remedy my situation with them because it would have cost more to ship the item back and forth. The item I received was no good. I got what I paid for which was a cheap laser that doesn't even point straight. Take my advice, spend the money to get something of better quality. I spent alot on the gun and didn't think I needed to spend for the accessories. Don't think like I did (like a dope trying to save a buck!)."
490430,1,"I use this while camping several times per year for my twin air mattress. Fills up the mattress and I use it to top off any air that escapes from the mattress each night during these week long trips. I think I'm on year 6 with this one.Only problem I had was the first trip when I didn't charge it before I left. Like the negative review before, being chained to the vehicle to use it is a pain. But if you do, leave it in the charge position and plug in to the vehicle for a couple of hours and it's good to go.I just need a new wall powered DC power source so I don't have to charge it in the truck.Model# AP617"
367396,0,So the one thing I didnt see when I placed my order for this shower bag was the length of the shower hose. It is way to short. I will be adding on a new hose as the one that comes with the bag is about 8 inches long. Everything else about the bag is pretty good. I like the pockets to hold soap and the mirror is a nice touch. The handle is well made and the over all quality is good. If they just gave you a longer hose it would be excellent.
332280,1,"I liked it, well packaged, seems reasonably sturdy for the price. Nice and bright, I thought it was broken at first because I turned it on and only one row of LEDs lit up, then I pushed the button again and both rows did...nice feature. You can't beat it for the price."
229388,2,The shoe quality is fine. But I ordered a size 34 = Boys 3 US and it the shoe says 37/235 on it. It's VERY BIG and unwearable. I can not find how to contact the seller to get another new smaller pair. Will not purchase from this vendor again.

145133,0,"We bought this sled about 3 years ago for our son's first Christmas (he was 8 months old). Unfortunately, when it snows here, we get several inches at once. We took him out for a ride and promptly tipped him face first into the snow. We thought that maybe it was because he was so little and waited until the next winter to try again. The same thing happened again. If the sled went over one of our tracks left by walking, the sled would tip.It is a beautiful looking sled and it perfect for setting the kids in by the blue spruce to take Christmas card photos, but it hasn't seen much use as a working sled.Today we had the perfect amount of snow, just a couple of inches, so I put my one year old in an pulled her all over the yard. She loved it, and it didn't tip once, but I was watching carefully and there were a couple of close calls. The place it worked best was on the non-shoveled sidewalks. There, it rode smoothly. I think this sled will be reserved for times when there is only a little snow or when it is actively snowing (and the walks are not cleared) while we walk my oldest to school."

320507,1,"I bought this to turkey hunt with so my gun wouldn't get wet while transporting on my ATV and side by side. All of my hunting buddies were impressed with it. Gun stayed completely dry and I am extremely satisfied. I have not tried dunking it in the pond like the Duck Dynasty Robertson's would have, but I would like to see someone else do it to see if it floats and keeps gun dry. Mine will probably wind up in a mud hole eventually, so I hope it don't sink."
93141,2,"According to the description, ""This is not the smaller version that came out later"". I was expecting the full size manual (8 1/2 x 11) like I've owned in the past.

122820,0,"This layout is the most basic I've seen. It does job at its low price, but it's not very high quality.It's mostly intended for dealer-managed games, not home games, since there is a specific seat for a ""Dealer"" on the Holdem side. We've actually drawn in two additional player spaces in that area since we don't have a designated dealer."
267893,2,"I purchased this goggle, and to my great disappointment, it doesn't fit on my head without exerting an enormous amount of pressure. If only 3 inches of additional length had been supplied to the headband, there would be no problem. Quite a waste of money!"

310078,2,"I bought this to use while camping as a shower. The structure is too flimsy to hold any size water bag. It happened to be windy the day I used it, and the poles snapped. It would be OK for privacy if you needed to change, but that's about it. Not recommended."
413689,2,"I liked the upbeat vibe from this, but I didn't feel like there were any people that looked like me. They all had great abs, and I never felt like I was doing it right, because I didn't look like them."
32698,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
473936,2,"Got one yesterday, not so impressed.It did keep hot water warm after a night, better than Contigo I got from Costco at half price.But it is inconvenient: When I want to drink from it, I have to unscrew the cap. This makes it useless while driving; and after removing the cap, it is same as any other mug or cup, can spill easily.So it is an overpriced, overrated product just like BOSE. I am thinking whether to keep it."

210688,1,"I've had many pairs of binoculars over many years, some pretty good, some pretty bad, but these Nikons were a surprise the first time I put them up for a view. They are, I think, the best you are going to do in the price range, and maybe better than you will do in the next range up."
439228,0,"This basket is a nice one. It seems relatively sturdy, although it did arrive with one side crushed down a bit. But I was able to bend it back into shape. To use the nice clip on feature, though, you need their special rear rack to clip into. I had ordered a different rear rack, thinking it would clip in universally to any rear rack. Not the case. So now I have to go through the hassle of returning the incompatible rear rack and finding the right one. All in all, though, I do think this will be a good system for biking to the grocery store and purchasing two bags of groceries. I also purchased two of the diamond cargo nets and they appear to work nicely with this basket for securing the grocery bags for the ride home."

From day one it leaked, started with just a couple drops progressed to steady, slow seeping after ~year. Contacted Stanley, said they'd send me a replacement cap & seal. Didn't get it, contacted Stanley again ~3 months later, said sorry, would send replacement cap & seal. Didn't get it, contacted 3d time, no apology this time, said they'd send replacement cap & seal.

209485,2,"I thought I could save some money. Boy, was I ever wrong! The clamps to attach the door gym to the door are heavy and so bulky the door wouldn't even close. The bungee cords are attached with &quot;pop&quot; metal that's stamped together. Very dangerous as the ends can slip out of the metal from the pressure when the cords are stretched during exercise. This machine is an accident just waiting to happen.The handles and only one(??) ankle strap are cheaply made and the snaps used to hook onto the bungee are so small it's almost impossible to connect to more than a couple of the bungee cords at the same time. Shoddy workmanship and clunky. Uugghh!If you want my advice, try a SmartGYM instead. It costs a bit more, but it's certainly worth it! The lightweight design (only 3.5 lbs) is fabulous. No clunky steel brackets that prevent the door from closing. Plus it's totally portable for traveling. Over 70 exercises for strength training and cardio! It even does Pilates. Plus it comes with 2 handles, 2 ankle straps, a cardio belt, a carry bag, 54-page manual and 30-minute workout video. And everything is well-made, too.I've tried them both and I know. SmartGYM is the REAL deal."

141177,0,"It met the goal of getting the bike past inspection, but the vibrations caused the nuts to loosen rather quickly and it doesn't have the length to provide a good rearward view. Needs to be a little more substantial for everyday use."
252078,1,I like these shorts because they are oversized. After my gas dryer from h*ll gets a hold of them they shrink down just perfect. These are great to sleep in only. No pockets suit me just fine with no bumpy material laying on your sides. They are very comfortable. The material gets softer with each washing. These make the perfect PJs only. I would not use these for any other activity's. Russell makes more durable shorts and w/pockets for the sports/workout minded person. These shorts should have been marketed as PJs. Now you know.

To get the u lock out by taking the wheel off the thieves would have to either wreck the frame by bending the dropouts tremendously, which would defeat the purpose of taking the bike in most cases, or cut the rear wheel open, which is no small feat.Or has this method been rendered obsolete by some new thief strategy I don't know about?Also: Solid lock in Denver, been using the older model for a few years with no issues."

211282,0,"Good product, fair price and easy to install, that is if one has the proper connectors. My 3 rating is not related to the product . It seems the manufacturer fails to give instructions as to the proper connector needed to complete the wire connections. I found out the hard way that standard off the shelf lug ring/eye terminal connectors will not work on this unit as the hole openings are too large and the outside of the connector will overlap between the lug post thus defeating the trip breaker. (See feedback on this site from Jeff) If you purchase this unit be sure to purchase a set of lug ring connectors that are designed to fit exactly over the 3/16"" lug bolts and are sized for the wires you are using ( 6 or 8 awg wire). Ring/eye connectors in these sizes may be hard to find at your local hardware store, you may want to shop on line. Also the ring connectors in size 8 and larger require an expensive set of compression pliers to properly make connections.A simpler alternative is to purchase a set copper mechanical lug connectors sized for 3/16"" bolts and copper wire range of #6 -#14. Copper lugs are little bulkier but easy to install with a flat blade screwdriver.The copper lug connectors I used are manufactured by ""Ideal"" part #770701L. These type connectors are available at most major home repair chains, your local electrical supplier or can be ordered on line. Do not use copper lug connectors on aluminum wire as they will corrode and fail over time."

244271,1,"WARNING!!!!!!!! THIS WILL BECOME YOUR NEW FAVORITE!! no other long sleeve t-shirt can compare with these SUPREME Russel brand shirts. it is so universal you can wear it for anything for any task and looks and feels great too and it has great quality which can last for years to come. its so comfortable and loose you don't have to worry about the texture or fit because the description and pic on amazon is accurate. buy this product in your size, your actual shirt size because these shirts are a little looser. please guys do not pull hard or stretch these because first when you wash it for the first time it will shrink about 1/10 of its actual size, however even though the fabric is a cotton/polyester blend so it has some elasticity to it the material can be permanently stretched if forced enough though-but it maintains it shape great but you have the option of stretching it to fit your preference if you got long arms or something, normally most people are OK with this. THE KEY POINT OF THESE SHIRTS ARE THE DIRIBILITY AND QUALITY."

Even after multiple washings with soap as well as vinegar, the bad taste and odor were there. I even tried putting bottled water in them...just to see if it was my city's tap water that was leaving the metallic taste. It didn't matter. They were unusable and I returned them. Try Klean Kanteens--they are a little more expensive but better quality and, best of all, don't taint the taste of your water!"
107532,1,"I really love this bike. It was a great buy for the price and everyone that sees it thinks it rocks. The directions to put it together are terrible and if you need on line help forget it. I had some damage to a couple of plastic nuts and a major scratch and tried repeatedly to get the parts from Bicycle Source Group without success. It's really hard to get the fenders and brakes aligned so the tires don't rub. If you are mechanically adept you can figure it out but for the rest of you, hire someone!!!!"

375768,0,"I've said it once and I'll say it again graphics do not make a game, I have been very generous with rating this game. Yes it gets you all fired up and really, really excited, but.........that's about it, the enthusiasm wears very quickly, for those of you who really understand the true fundamentals of basketball and really love the game you will know what I'm talking about. Sega have really pushed the visual reality that much further but there's still so much MORE! development to be done. Fast Breaks (I don't think so), passing to players out of bounds, ball in play before players are even on the court I mean what's that all about can somebody please tell me? And saving the game 'settings and rosters' and keeping them that way surely it shouldn't take a whole VMU to do so on the PSX it only takes 8 memory block for NBA Live and that's a hell of a lot more feed back on you season that NBA 2K will offer you (Quite an expensive game if I may say so). You are not really in control of what you want to do if you are winning by over 40 points don't let your players drive too often or they will be injured for about a month and in the playoffs you don't need that. Considering that it requires and whole VMU to capture your progress over the regular season surely you should have a lot more saving options and season stats, and speaking of a regular season why can't you defend your title why do you have to restart and win from scratch (COME ON SEGA) There are a lot of things that needs fixing before the next release of NBA 2K.1. At the Moment EA are still holding court. My advise rent before you buy you could save yourself some hard earned currency."

The DX does not have these panniers - the side pockets are indeed side pockets.Most of these reviews - and the photo - apply to the the Topeak MTX Trunk Bag DX from 2007 and earlier.

It has a mesh pocket on top, and the bungee covers only half of the top. The side pockets look larger. They've eliminated the carrying handle.

119543,1,just as you see on the picture. it's regular size. you can probably pull down the sides to cover your ears but it's really designed to show the rockets sign clearly. nothing bad about it but it charges a bit more than it should. it happens to a lot of sports signature product or team product.
128929,1,"sporty and stylish. you can wears these pants traveling or to work. very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new ""Utlimate ROC"" pants. These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants. by thicker, i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness. the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single ""cargo pocket"" on the leg, but is not zipped. the new version has a zipper there. both of the ""cargo"" pockets are not big and bulky. you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets. So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper. the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great.

91204,0,"I have no beef with the watch itself. The Seiko SKXa53 is a superior, high quality, affordable automatic (self-winding) dive watch. The bracelet, however, is cheap and not well made, despite it looking very nice in the photographs.But Watch Pavilion is a troublesome vendor. Be cautious with this seller. Avoid them if possible. I bought the ""value package,"" choosing ""expedited"" shipping at a whopping $20 for a 1 to 3 day delivery. But the order arrived very very late and in two sections -- the watch itself arriving about ten days later, and the rest of the shipment two weeks later. What's more, I was not told about any of this -- and when I queried for several days via email, nobody answered. Completely ridiculous.When I tried to ""track package"" using Watch Pavilion's interface with Amazon, I learned they'd sent my package to Pennsylvania (whereas I live in Illinois). They apparently really DIDN'T send my package to PA: they just put someone else's information on MY ""track package"" page.TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, when I did finally (after several many many days) get the watch, it did not have the appropriate blue disc of plastic on the back, showing it has new and unused, and the cellophane on the bracelet was tattered and falling off: it, in other words, was pre-owned.Not wanting to deal any futher with Watch Pavilion, I kept it. It keeps good time (gaining 12 sec's per day -- not bad for an automatic). Buy this from someone else.NOTE, too: that the textual description on this page does not match the photographs -- which shows a band remover, a link remover, an extra rubber bracelet, and the watch."
380664,1,the thing that's cool about this is that I just put it in a waist pack that I keep my phone and camera in and then I forget it. Every couple of weeks I hook it up to my PC and it downloads my activity so I can see if I need to increase my number of steps. It has a notion of what an aerobic step is versus just walking around in a bookstore or the like. it's a great product. It's fairly accurate but not as good as GPS or shoe pod types - but the always on feature is really appealing.

5623,0,"I recently obtained a Bersa .380 hangun as a gift. I've been shooting for over 20 years, off and on for fun.This was my first personal handgun and I wanted something adequate to store/carry it in without having astupid, over-priced case to carry around. The case itself is not thick, it's molded plastic and the twofoam insert are thick and i'm sure are good enough to protect it.It even has a small hole in the handle to attatch a small laptop/luggage lock. The dimensions are off, mainly being it is best for smaller handguns but larger ones with 5"" barrels and larger caliburs will need a larger case.Might be a tight fit for those and other reviewers have managed to fit two handguns inside easily. (See above pics.)For those not wanting to spend a ton of cash on just a case it's not a bad purchase. I do believe that if someone wanted to get inside they could. I would suggest anyone owning anytime of firearm purchase a good gun lock for each one. I've found them to be $10-$12 a piece and they do have multipacks. They keys for those are random so one cannot simply purchase a replacement key.That said, it arrived on time and in the condition listed. Good purchase."

The chain itself seems to be well made and as I have not attempted to cut it myself I can only go by what the manufacture claims and hope that the property is secure. I would bet that it is.The lock itself does not work for my situation. I live in Michigan and this lock is pretty much useless all winter as it easily freezes up. The design of it allows any moisture to run right into the top of the lock and it does not take much before you are having to use a torch to un-thaw it. I would have to take it inside and let it dry out completely before I could use it again. But as soon as there is any precipitation, once again the lock is frozen.

You never get your heart rate going.If you ""work out"" for 3 minutes and then stand there for 2 minutes waiting for the next exercise and the explanation you are never going to get anything from it.I really wish i could return this game. Such a waste. At least the Wii fit has cutesy games you can play. This is just a sham."

450992,0,"a lot of the replacement 27in wheels available skimp on something, like spoke count, spoke material, or rim material. these are a nice alloy rim and 36h hub, combined with STAINLESS STEEL SPOKES. SS spokes are far stronger and more desirable than ucp spokes (which is what the similarly prices sta tru wheel comes with). Only dowside to this wheel is the rim is single wall, and it comes still needing the spokes to be stress relieved (look up how to do it). also the hubs were a little tight, but the bearings were nicely greasedupdate: about 4 mos in spokes started breaking. I would not recommend this rim if you are a heavy rider. it is on my brothers bike and he weighs 230. so far 3 broken spokes and once they start popping it is like popcorn. still if you are lighter it is a good wheel"

He can see everything I see, so we can talk the whole time. Installed easily and works great. Wish the shoulder straps were a little closer together. Modified that myself and it keeps the straps from sliding off one shoulder. Everbody with small kids are very impressed as we ride by. Did find it benificial to lower the seat in order to be close to flat footed when we come to a stop. This helps stabilize the weight up high at rest. Great product!!Charlie"

390851,0,"My review closely follows ""toughcrowd"" who wrote an excellent and detailed review.(...)Remember that the bezel is bi-directional in keeping with the concept of the watch. There's no ratchet/spring device to keep it from moving around which for me was aggravating.The background UTC and 24 hour subdials are ok with me but should have been designed better to allow for larger time markers. Given the choice I'd rather have larger markers than the two subdials which are not a necessity.The digital clock/date window is too small and has black LCD figures on a gray background. It needs to be larger and the background color more contrasting with the digits for better visibility. It's hard to read the digital time or date even in daylight. The digital clock and date are useless at night due to no background light.The time markers and hands do have illuminous coatings. But the hands and markers are so small that they are too dim at night. My experience was that the coatings only held light for a short time-certainly not overnight.The lack of half-hour time adjustment is unfortunate but will only affect those in Newfoundland, Suriname, Iran, India, Sri Lanka, and Central Australia. Suriname, Iran and Sri Lanka are not on my travel list so this is almost inconsequential.The alarm volume is way too low and not adjustable.If you have a skinny wrist and have to take a few links out the watch may become uncomfortable as it did for me.This indeed is a nice looking watch with many functions but you have to consider its limitations as well. The numerous features and functions of the Eco-Drive are still quite impressive. Except for the Arabic numeral bit, this timepiece is loaded with amenities. It's difficult to find a quality solar-powered watch with so many functions.I cannot find anyone or any study that shows titanium is more prone to surface damage than stainless steel. In fact it is twice as strong, a third lighter, and is extremely corrosion resistant compared to stainless. Unless you like the polished look of stainless, which is less expensive, go with titanium. I've also researched analog/digital watches solar watches and Citizen is the way to go. The 5-year warranty and the Amazon price are outstanding as well-the retail price is $575.00.Having said all of that, I ended up returning the watch. The clincher was it simply became too uncomfortable after taking links out to fit my relatively skinny wrist. I give the 51L a marginal recommendation but look forward to continued evolution in design from Citizen and others in the solar/chronograph category. The Skyhawk should rely less on the Blue Angels motif and more on functionality."

47284,0,"I've had mine for about eight years and it's still in good shape and does the job when called on. I wear it about a quarter of the time when it's raining.You're basically looking at a parka hood versus the hat. The hat gives you good vision but provides no air management. The hood is the opposite.The hat will have you sweating above 50 degrees, negating the rain it keeps off, although that wouldn't be a problem if you're just standing around waiting for a bus, say. It also blows around in the wind, which by itself is annoying, but also doesn't do much to keep you dry and warm in driving rain. You will definitely loose this hat if you don't keep the neck strap tight in windy weather.Contrast that with a hood on your rain parka or sweatshirt hoodie. That's always handy, and you never have to stick a wet hood in your otherwise dry pocket. With the hood you get good air management, that is, it keeps the wind off of you and lets moist air circulate. The downside is a restricted view and muted sounds, and if it's a man made material then it can be somewhat noisy.So ja, the hat is fine and does a good job in the right conditions. For me personally, those conditions are circa 32 to 55 temps and very low or no wind where I want peripheral vision to see what's going on around me."

317498,0,"Over the past year, I've reloaded about 2000 rounds of 380 ACP using this die set. I have come to like some features of it, and curse others.What's in the box:380 load data for common powders and rounds. Of no use to me since I shoot cast bullets because I am cheap.A powder scoop that works for some powders, but not all. I use Titegroup and HP38 mostly. It works great for HP38.Three dies: 1. a full length resizer / decapper. 2. Expander die with the little powder through expander thing. 3. Bullet seater and crimp. As the dies go, they're carbide. You shouldn't need to lube them at all since the 380 is a straight wall case.The decapping die is fantastic. The design of it is such that you will avoid broken decapping pins if you find a berdan primed piece of brass in your 380 bullets. I broke one pin once, and Lee sent me a replacement free no questions asked. Great service.The expander die is hit and miss. It's not very good for cast bullets. But it works quite well for plated or jacketed bullets.The seating and crimp die is awful. I have so many issues getting a consistent overall length with this thing. After many trials and errors getting it set correctly, I can only come to one conclusion: it's the die. There's just too much slack in its construction. In the stock photo on this page, you see the three dies sitting in the red container. The seater die to the one on the left in about the 9 o'clock position. That little screw on the stop is how you adjust the OAL. But when pressing the ram, it slides up and down, back and forth. I cannot figure out how to get it to stay put. Two identical pieces of brass, two identical bullets, and I get two very different overall lengths.It's a bit troubling. Also, for cast, forget about seating and crimping in one step. I was getting my cast bullets off center when I seat and crimp in one step. When I separated it into a seat step then crimp step, I got much better groups.Lee makes a very low cost product that seems to attract a wide and loyal following. They have outstanding customer service, but I am hesitant to recommend this set for the reloader. If I was to do it all over, I would start withLyman 380 Auto Carbide 3 Die Set. The cost difference is small, but the performance difference is great."
202795,0,"I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised? Does the value justify the cost? Does it improve my life? I put my recommendation at the top, then answer those three questions below.RECOMMENDATIONThe coupling of this HRM with the Garmin 305 is pretty standard setup. I recommend getting the combo.FUNCTIONALITYTracks your heart rate data over time. With the right testing and analysis, you can really increase your day to day workout effectiveness by using heart rate as your metric, instead of RPE or speed. Everybody has bad days, and if your only goal is to spead X amount of time in Y heart rate zone, you can acheive that even on a bad day. The battery life seems pretty excellent. Been using mine for 2 years without replacing the battery. Occasionally, it takes really crazy readings that are way too high, but that's pretty rare - I've only seen grossly errant measurements 2 or 3 times in hundreds of workouts, and it might have been due to the band slipping down too far and losing contact.VALUEAgain, I recommend buying the combo of the 305 + HRM.DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?The main benefits of the HRM for me are: in running, making sure I'm not pushing too hard too early in the run, and in biking, making sure my heart rate is high enough. You really have to get your heart to the point where it will cooperate at high power, so sometimes you have to go for a tougher gear and push your HR up."
384980,0,"I bought this originally to bring juice to work in from my juicer. I popped it in the refrigerator the night before to keep it cold. It stayed cold all day then, which is excellent. I love how long this thing keeps liquids cold. I haven't tried hot liquids in it yet. I love that it's normal stainless steel, since anything painted seems to start chipping or peeling after a little while. The pour spout makes it easy to pour into another glass if needed without dribbling and I'm sure will help prevent you from burning your mouth on hot liquids. It does slow the flow of liquids, so it probably won't make the best sports water bottle. My biggest complaint about it is liquids seem to get trapped in the lid area and leak out a little while moving if not kept straight up and down. I would normally put this in my backpack where any juice leaking out would cause a sticky mess. A nice bottle, but not the best."

24387,1,My teenager loved it and will be bringing it each year to the Patriots Training camp to collect his autographs!
399823,0,They work well but I didn't receive what the picture was showing. I got all black arrows and I did want the colored ones.
485517,0,I am a first time tent buyer and the directions that come with this are a lot less than a beginner needs. I tried for an hour to figure out how to put this tent up and still have not been able to. You definately need at least 2 adults and someone who has knowledge of putting tents up as the directions are very brief. I have not yet used it so I cannot atest to its durability.
420812,0,this tool has several useful functions but is not as sturdy as a standard Swiss Army tool.
148206,1,I gave this to my son as a gift and I've heard no complaints. This was something he requested and I was glad I could get it for him.
68836,0,"Overall I was relatively pleased with these glasses for my work in dental school. I don't remember them fogging up excessively. The fit was relatively comfortable. However, one day I noticed they had several severe scratches on their lenses which made them all but useless. Perhaps I had put them next to something abrasive in my locker, but I would have hoped the lenses would be more scratch resistant for being labeled that the lenses are coated for ""superior scratch resistance.""If you can ensure that they won't get scratched, these could be the safety glasses for you. But if scratch resistance is important for you, look elsewhere. Hope I helped in your decision!"
147681,0,I would recomend this trap. On the first day of use i caught about 11 baitfish. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because it's cheaply made. On the first day of use the zipper fell off. the best way to use this trap is to let the bait float around in the trap instead of putting it in the bait bag. Use mackeral and bits of shrimp as bait.
274455,0,"I own several Russell t-shirts that are about 10 years old. They are heavy cotton and even 10 years later...still are holding up well. I got this one today and the cotton is probably 50% of what it used to be. You can almost see through it compared to the old Russell shirts. I think that a Beefy T-shirt is thicker. Disappointing for what they used to be. If you don't mind a thinner cotton shirt, this one is good."
276769,0,i think this is a good product as it went along with the everlast bag and got good customer service
300801,0,"My wife and I got a tip that Schwinn made the best mid-priced elliptical. We were happy with the price and reviews were high, so we made the purchase. However, I don't use the machine, just my wife. The reason is that the stride is too short for my liking. I like to alternate the ride on my toes to work my calves, and then my heels to work legs and I can't do that on this machine. You have to stay on the front part of your foot because of the stride."
284390,1,"This is a very well made, thick leather lifting belt. It provides a great amount of support for your core and lower back when worn while squatting and deadlifting. I used to look down on lifting belts as unnecessary crutches, but after tweaking my lower back a few months ago I've done a complete 180. I won't do any heavy weight now without the belt, it helps to keep your form perfect and allows you to get the most you can from your squats and deadlifts. This belt in particular is recommended because it is wide in the front as well as the back, providing maximal support. Don't bother with some cheapo velcro or nylon belt, get this or something similar. I expect to get many years use out of this belt, and my back is already thanking me for buying it."
51791,0,"I'm disappointed with EA's attempt at college football for the Xbox 360. First of all, much of the game play is similar to previous years, so I was almost tired of it before I even finished my first game. The 360 version seems to be tailored for HD TVs, making text and plays difficult to read on my old fashioned 27 incher. EA has also removed many of the features that I enjoyed. I'm a fan of Nebraska, whose great teams are all sadly in the receding past. Hence, I enjoyed playing the historic and All-Time teams, which are missing from this version. I also liked the campus challenge and the unlockable pennants; also gone.There are a couple of positives, however. You can now select plays by play type instead of formation, which is much easier for me. The 3 mini games are also fun for a short time.All in all, I'd say, stick with NCAA06. Unfortunately, there is zero chance that it will ever be made compatible with 360, since it would reduce EAs ability to sell the crappy 07 version to 360 owners."
361307,1,This is really a great product to increase core muscle strength. It's also very easy to set up. After a few weeks of use (3-5minutes daily) you will notice changes in your abdominal area as well as in your shoulder muscles.All in all a great product I recommend purchasing.
13460,0,"These shorts don't fit as well as I wish they did, which is in part, my fault. However...other than that they are satisfactory."
446321,0,My son loves to go play airsoft and there is nothing soft about that game so I wanted him protected.
317313,0,"It's good, but sometimes it takes too long to launch so you get bored waiting and get caught off guard and you could walk (or put your face) in front of it at the wrong time. Fun 'cuz it can throw a very long way (& very high up), but it is hard to catch. VERY LOUD! Broke once, but my Grandpa was able to fix it."
37915,0,The bottom part of the vest is too loose as if it's meant to be worn by people with a big belly.
405017,0,"My son loves the set, but was very disappointed due to pretty severe damage on the handle. I noted reviews concerning damage due to poor packaging prior to my purchase, but took a chance. Will hopefully be able to exchange without too much hassle."
328779,1,"I don't have anything to compare this too, since it was my first 'wicking' technology pair of shorts, but I must say it has lived up to my expectations"
74335,1,"I was very happy with the speed at which my order was shipped (it was holiday season). When the Old Century game arrived, it was more than i ever expected. The craftsmanship is outstanding. I purchased it as a gift for my father whose favorite team is the Phillies, so it was really cool to have that detail."
437249,1,Functional. My previous gloves had a better feel to them. They are a bit big. Overall definitely a good buy.
499998,0,"its a nice football. Nothing special, doesnt glow extra bright or anything, but it's nice to have for kids with smaller hands"
104947,1,"I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago. I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs. The oldest ones are getting too worn out for ""dressy"" occasions and have been relegated to work pants. I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking. Good looking, tough wearing, and very comfortable. I hope they never stop making them!"
39600,1,"They are sweatbands, no surprises here. They have held up perfectly in the wash. They decorate my son's wrists nicely."
496346,1,"I bought this seat for my wife and though we haven't ridden very much since then, it's apparent that it's very comfortable. I was a little cautious because it wasn't a gel seat, but it is certainly as comfortable as any gel seat I've tried. Thumbs up for sure."
490033,1,"This does a decent, quick job of getting oil off your ball while you are at the lane bowling. If you want something better, you need to either pay to use one of the automatic polishing machines or take the time to spray and hand polish, but that is not reasonable in-between frames. My son also thinks this is fun to use, which is good and bad - it makes him want to actually clean his ball, but then he wants to do it all the time because it is fun. A good addition to your bowling gear. Ours is blue, like they state, colors may vary."
239066,0,"I have one of these life jackets, and it's definitely a quility built life jacket. I tested it by jumping into the lake one day, even though I cannot swim. Sure enough it supported me in the water without any trouble. If general safety is your only purpose in looking for a life jacket, this one is a safe bet.Comfort varies with this jacket. While they are more comfortable than less expensive life jackets, they are not particularly comfortable during rowing. The life jacket has a tendency to slip up from my waist during rows, even with a secure fit. If you're just spectating in boat and not doing anything, however, this jacket does just fine.Alternatives to this around the same price is Cabela's Full Motion Vest. It allows more freedom of movement during rowing, and is much more comfortable."
336158,2,"Completely useless product. Wobbles and there is no adjustment for the leg shape/size.Instead, buy velcro type ASO ankle stabilizer WITH stays."
188900,0,"Bought this last Christmas, it made it through the summer, but by this point it no longer has any grip. So I got the kids another one this Christmas. At this price ($8.99) I believe we got our value out of it but feel it should have stood up to a little more abuse than it did."
306004,0,"PRO: 127tpi makes these tires nice and supple so they handle and ride like a dream. If you haven't ridden on a high end tire before and can get a great price on these, you should definitely try them. I paid only about $20 a tire, so it was well worth it.CON: Though they're rather resistant to puctures they have an outstanding ability to swallow whole bits of glass that you will have to dig out with your multitool. Putting this tire on your rear wheel will result in a tire riddled with small cuts. If you ride in places prone to sharp, tire puncturing road debris--like the entirety of New York City for instance--then don't buy these tires or at least don't put it on your rear wheel.BOTTOM LINE: I went through several of these tires, which lasted only a few months each, before giving up on them. The problem is, while a piece of glass or other sharp debris wont usually pass through all the way to the tube for a straight up puncture, eventually something will put a gash in your tire that is so big that the tube bubbles out of it and bursts.I should note however that stiffer tubes--like Bontrager--will not bubble out as easily, so if you're going to get these tires, make sure to pair them with pricey name brand tubes, not cheapo tubes such as Pyramid.These are the first tires I've ever had to patch the actual tires instead of just the tubes.Fortunately, Hutchinson offers the same great performance in a slightly heavier and tougher Kevlar tire--the Fusion Comp 2 Kevlar."
43560,0,"The pad seems to be sturdy and well-made. I have attached it to the sled and the side straps are definitely long enough. The padding could be more dense but the fabric looks like it will hold up well, at least it is not vinyl. To get the best performance, use liquid car wax on the bottom of your toboggan."
127046,0,"I bought this Airsoft Gun as a substitute untill I buy a new, much nicer, Airsoft Rifle. I was not very accurate, and the BB's tended to curve upward sharply. The stock is made of cheap plastic, and was unuseable for me. The sight, and the small plastic piece connecting it tended to fall of at inopertune times, so i had to seal it on to the gun. However the gun is very light, easy to handle, and has a large magizine capicity (32 Rounds)for the type of gun. It is also easy to cock, and is a nice replica of a MP40. It is a decent weapon, but should only be used for yard wars, or decoration, or the money saved to buy a nicer airsoft Gun."
58789,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed. Thank you ladies, for your review comments, as I rely on these to make my purchases."
264904,1,"Got it for my grandson, he really liked it. I was at his house over the weekend and saw it, looked really nice."
205236,1,"This item is perfect for that reserve battery when the main dies without notice. Installed this in my 2010 GMC Sierra 1500. This is mainly sold for marine applications for safety purposes. Its specific application is a reserve when needed, the isolation keeps it charged. easy install if you have room in the engine compartment. I have tested it it works perfect...."
77196,0,"It's not expensive. I use it very occasionally (tiny print on watch batteries, for example, or pulling splinters). The light really is useless, so have a separate light or flashlight. The lens is cheap plastic, with a small &#34;spot&#34; area for more mag, but it works fine.I can't imagine trying to use this for daily use."
194356,0,"It was a decent disk, but was not very bright. I thought the batteries were dead, so I bought new ones. Same result. It is a decent disk, but not amazing."
444654,1,Easy review. I really like these goggles for their fit and effectiveness. With other goggles I've had to really cinch them down to get a good seal. Not so with these. I get a good seal without just from the design of the eye pockets. Very satisfied.
15344,1,"I ordered the Koolatron to carry my yogart, protein power drink and insulin on long travels. I commute 32 miles one way to the office and it keeps my lunch fresh. Remember though that your items should be cold already or from the fridge. It definitely does and job and fits nicely in my vehicle."
445579,2,"Description of these socks stated there was no elastic which is a false statement, other than that I guess they were okay, but they had too much elastic for me so I returned them"
355605,0,"I bought this item because I wanted an inexpensive stopwatch - not a watch or an alarm clock. The setting of the various features is not particularly intuitive, and it's easy to jog it from one mode to another inadvertently. It serves its function, but I think it could be better."
308965,0,"Like the weight and size of the sack, but was disappointed that it came apart so easily at the velcro seam. Though I appreciate being able to open it up on the side / seam, would be better if it only opened with intended effort."
494803,0,"I bought this item to wear while hiking in the summer to protect my arms from ticks. It was a great, lightweight piece of clothing, but while the fabric wicked away sweat well enough, it also reatined the smell of said sweat. After a long day of hiking in the woods, this shirt was somewhere in between ripe and rancid and everyone around me knew it! On other occasions when I was not exerting myself as much it functioned perfectly, wicking away persperation and not retaining the scent.Other thoughts, I bought white, and wish I hadn't since it doesn't come all the way clean, even with pretreating and bleach. My shirts are now a very subtle shade of gray.As long as you aren't someone who gets cold easily, this shirt would probably serve extremely well in early spring and late fall. Being a hot bodied person, I see myself using this throughout the winter.ADDED AFTER 1 YEAR OF OWNERSHIP:I should have mentioned in th eintial review that there is no elastic at the wrists, so protecting your arms form ticks is OK, but they can slip up under the cuff pretty easily.Also, I wear these infrequently. Since getting them, I have probably only worn them about 15 times, and I have noticed that the elastic at th eneck is failing and the shirts are getting lose around the neck (I hate that feeling)."
350827,0,"Ordered this for my husband who is a fairly big man, but this watch was so big we returned it. It is beautiful and has great features, but BIG."
385624,0,This is ok but it's not very relaxing... I would classify this music as a bollywood soundtrack.
125377,1,This belt is fantastic for the price. It's just what my son has been looking for for his play stuff. Most belts don't come with all the little pouches they are all sold seperately. Great product!!
314250,0,overall good value and a little thinner than the higher end uniforms. You have to ask for the size chart 1st to buy as i guessed wrong on the size. they were very good at communication/response and overall refunded my stuff. Good Vendor just wished they put the size chart on the website instead of asking for it.
398244,0,"It's beautiful. I loved it when I first got it and put it together. But once the toys got in there and challenged the sides, the bolts kept coming out. It is very poorly designed. So we took it apart and use it as wall decorations. Not recommended."
343632,0,"My daughter loves it. She is 10 and a little under the 80lb min so getting it to bounce is tricky. Had to show her how to jump on with both feet to get it started.The end caps on the handle bars popped out after an hour of use. The foam on the handlebars twists with use as well and will likely tear away over time.However, these concerns are minor considering the low price."
431408,1,"Got this to go in an vehicle and works great, seems very durable, and was the cheapest one I could find!"
100536,1,"So far so good, no problems, the display is nice and large. A very basic monitor"
124932,0,"Made the other person happy, I did not use this item. I would not be the person to rate it!"
96688,0,"Do yourself a huge favor and try your hardest NOT to wash this product. I know, tough when it's an apron and you're either BBQ'ing or cooking, sauces and juices flying everywhere. The logo fades quickly after two to three washes sort of negating the need for a logo in the first place. Works fine, does what it does, annoying that it's not made better."
81245,0,"I bought this on clearance expecting it to fit as my daughter wears size 28 in all other swimsuit brands. Not the case - she couldn't even squeeze into it. Its a nice thick suit would be a good training suit, just sizing issue."
344626,0,"I PURCHASED THESE PANTS AND THEY WERE NOT TRUE TO SIZE. I WOULD PURCHASE THEM AGAIN, BUT WOULD GO 2 SIZES UP THE NEXT TIME."
288979,1,This does a great job of keeping me warm when I'm out running in cold weather. It can be a little uncomfortable as the material is a bit stiff and the mock turtleneck is a little irritating around the neck. But those are minor issues and overall I'm happy with the shirt and wear it frequently.
156658,0,"I ordered this chair on November 3, 2008 so I've only had it for a little over 2 months now. It did take a little bit of adjustment to begin with...and I did remove the back since I found myself wanting to slouch with the back as something to lean against. Since then it has worked fine....until the air stopped staying in it. For the past week I've had to repump up the ball every morning...and then again half way thru my day. I've checked it for leaks but we can't seem to find/hear/see one. I'm gathering that after a couple of months the plug must get loose perhaps and let air seep out slowly. If I only had to repump it up once a week or so, as I did in the beginning, I would have given it 5 stars. However, for what this thing cost I expect better performance. I'm leaning towards what one other reviewer said.....get the regular ball and use it without the chair part. I do that at my kitchen table and it seems to work fine so at this point I'm out $100 for this chair and I'm headed to Target to buy a bigger ball to use at my desk by itself. Sitting on a ball is the way to go....just need to get the basic ball so if it starts going flat after a couple of months you're only out $20 versus $100 (or $80 now that it's been marked down)."
333991,1,"We cut back our spending this past Christmas and, because I've carried one for years, I gave this to all my buddies (I gave the Victorinox Swiss Card to their wives). Practical, convenient, necessary."
343301,0,it says it goes with the jbl 6'but it doesnt now i will have to manufacture a piece to join both things...other than that it is really nice
484620,0,"I've had one of these since it first came out. Generally OK, mostly does what I need it to do. HOWEVER, the flashlight is completely useless. I gave up trying to fix the contact and/or feed it batteries well over a year ago. Unless the light is redesigned, don't count on using it for long. Otherwise a decent product."
458816,1,"Personally I bought the 5"" lure despite the recommendation that it was ""too large"". The first night I brought it out I pulled in a nice 29"" Northern Pike. Unfortunately the skin of the lure didn't stand up to the teeth of the fish all that well and it lost the eyes in the fight. Still the movement and look of this lure is the best mimicry of a minnow I've got in my tackle box. I'm sad the only fish I landed tore it up so much, but I'll certainly buy another one before next years trip."
98929,0,"FYI: This light actually uses AAA batteries, not AA batteries. This detail is incorrectly stated in the product description."
291256,0,"I bought this bottle because I like to be environmentally friendly whenever I can be. It cost a bit more than I thought was necessary, but that's life. I wanted stainless steel rather than aluminum and I had to pay for it. I agree that the opening is a bit too large to drink out of without fear of it sloshing out all over you. For this reason, I don't recommend it as a bottle to leave in your car and drink from as you're driving. I love that I can put it in the dishwasher. However, I quickly found out that more paint has peeled off after each trip through the dishwasher. If I had to do it over again, I'd get the non-painted bottle. It looks pretty tacky as it is now with large splotches of stainless steel showing where the brown paint has come off."
235153,0,Please check the dimensions before ordering. It looks great in the picture and is in fact very small.The knife was shipped on time with good packaging.I look forward to finding a similar knife that is more like the picture.
448657,0,"I ordered this product as a gift but was surprised to receive it in black rather than UT burnt orange. When I asked the seller about it, I was told that they never had it in orange and that Amazon lumps all sellers together and only allows one picture. Although it appears to be nice enough, the lunch box itself is on the small side but will hold a sandwich, small snack and 12 oz drink. Still, I am disappointed that I received something I did not order. It might be okay if one of UT's school colors was black but that's not the case."
44426,0,The CycleOps mat arrived at my door in no time with Prime shipping. When I took the mat out of the box though the sticker peeled off so now it is just a blank mat. It seems to absorb vibration but my CycleOps trainer makes more noise and it is the Fluid 2. The mat also is a little short so the front wheel is barely on the mat.
273728,1,"These traps are AWESOME !!! I live on a 300 acre farm in Ohio and have had a huge increase in the Groundhog / Woodchuck population this year. I decided to level the playing field and put 4 of these traps to work around the farm and got 17 Groundhogs in 5 weeks. One of the traps would hit at least every other day. Highly recommended, but you must be pretty stout to set them by hand without the tool."
267279,0,"I bought these hoping they weren't like the kickballs in the store that aren't perfectly round. The storebought balls get egg shaped within a few weeks of use. Because the balls come deflated, I was hoping I could air them up to prevent the egg shape. That didn't happen with all of them. Some are round right now but I'm not holding my breath."
309955,1,needs to be seasoned but thats just addd water and oil to smooth the rough edges now its drying and almost ready to use.
149593,0,"I bought these a couple of weeks ago for skydiving and have been fairly happy with them. I like the versatility of lens colors and like the ability to swap between the head strap and traditional sunglass temples. When I tightened the head strap up for jumping, they fogged a little, but I've never seen a set of tight goggles that didn't fog at some point. They work well as sunglasses and goggles as far as I can tell. I wouldn't say they're the best on the market, but am not dissatisfied with the purchase.The lenses are easy to swap, but I'm a bit leary of the clasps that hold them in...they seem somewhat frail in comparison to the rest of the construction."
388695,1,"Very well made and durable,clean lines and extremely sharp out of the box. I have used Sog knives for years and they have never let me down in any situation. I have used Sog knives (Seal pups) (only real difference is the size and handle grip) Elite and regular models to dispatch all kind of snakes and Gars on the river, skin wild game etc and have used as a utility knife in the woods also. Sog blades are tough hold a good edge for a long time and are dependable ""They will not let you down period!!"" I would trust my life to the quality of this or the Seal Pup knife. If you are thinking of getting this knife or the smaller Seal Pup don't hesitate. It will be a satisfying experience not only for the good deal you get price-wise but also for the return on the investment in it in the form of good performance and quality materials that it is made from. Other Sog products that are note worthy also include the Jungle Canopy, The Nw Ranger their multi-tools Tomahawks etc. DO yourself a favor and add one too your collection if you can!!"
265506,0,"Got it for my new bike. service was good, it arrived in time. It was delivered undamaged. The quality of the lock is not that of great, and the size is a little small but still managing to use it on my full suspension bike. I would recommend it if you have a not so expensive bike. It is a good product for the price."
350398,1,it does everything it advertises as well as sets it's own time to the atomic clock and automaticly changes between standard and day lite savings time. indestructable for the active female
439966,0,"I have used Toko brushes to wax my nordic skis for many years and could not be more satisfied with the quality of their products. However, when I ordered this brush the picture showed it as a full copper brush but I received a half nylon half copper brush. Toko brushes are great and when I get the opportunity to use this one I know I will not be disappointed, but I still would have appreciated a more accurate picture of what I was actually receiving."
494731,2,"the directions are horrible. i've hooked something like this up before , and so i improvised. it doesnt work. i called customer service , they responded quickly and tried to resolve problem. they're sending me a new wire for it."
434856,1,I bought this for a trip overseas to use on the plane. I like it better than the plane pillow. I thought it would roll up smaller though but it still fit in my carry on bag.UPDATE: I have the medium pillow it's a little bit bigger than a plane pillow. If you are a man you might want to get the larger one. Remember to fluff the pillow I didn't at first and just stood there a looked at it waiting for it to do something.
482744,1,"This is by far the best knife I have ever owned. It is very solid and well built. When you hold the knife it feels sturdy in your hand. The way the knife opens is smooth and effortless. Just apply a little pressure with your index finger and the blade is out and locked into place in a second. The blade is VERY sharp, it can cut paper, plastics (thick or thin) like butter without dulling. The frame lock is sturdy and I would never but another knife without it. The belt clip is great and can be attached to either side of the knife. As far as I can tell this is the highest quality knife I have ever owned. I do not anticipate having to purchase any other knife for a long time, unless I lose this one."
15519,1,"This product is fantastic. I have never used foam glove conditioner before and it worked great. In my opinion, it's better than the oil based conditioners."
344653,0,"I like everything about these pants except for the belt. Most football pants have the belt go all the way around the pants so you can adjust the waist easy, but these ones are stitched on. I had to end of fixing the stitch so my son could even wear them, or else they would keep falling off. Good quality material, but I do not thing I would ever purchase them again because of the belt issue."
213974,0,"I had to return these boots because of the unfinished inner seam on the shaft. It rubbed my ankles adn felt uncomfortable. Thicker socks helped, but then felt it too tight in the foot. Overall, the boots looked great and were otherwise well-made. Would probably work well if you can wear with thick socks."
302598,1,"FIRSTLY, i want to say that i've gotten through 3 weeks of this program and I am completely addicted! I am a girl, and a major girly girl at that, and i still love these. I know a lot of women have been worried they cannot handle it, but you can!!! it definitely kicks my butt, but i just pause the dvd whenever i am out of breathe and need a longer break. i do every single rep that the people on the t.v do, just with longer breaks. Before 3 weeks ago i couldn't do a single pushup (yes i know i have absolutely NO upper body strength, but now i can keep up with the people better. i can do 20 pushups in a row without stopping, which is saying something for weak armed me!ALSO, most importantly, i purchased this product used from amazon for only $60!!!! and guess what? the used dvd's work perfectly. i got the nutrition guide, calendar, and all the workout dvd's and they all play great! so for people saying they don't want to purchase these because they are too expensive, buy them used from a trusted seller here on amazon! i'm so glad i did that because i'm a broke college student and don't have $100-150 to afford these at regular price.FINALLY, i absolutely love this workout program for 5 reasons:1) i can wear my pajamas to workout. i use to hate going to the gym because i was always so worried about how i looked and how others looks that it was hard for me to concentrate.2) i was afraid to push myself to hard at the gym for fear of messing up or people judging me for my small sized weights, but now i workout in my basement and can act and look like an idiot while i do these videos which is amazing! (i play club music during them so during the 30 breaks i am dancing and jamming to the music haha)3) i HATE the cold and winter, so i use to hate leaving my house and having to endure the cold to get to the gym. but now i can stay inside my nice warm house and workout without being cold :)4) I am a night owl and always do my P90X at 11 at night, so this is a huge bonus that i can do these videos anytime. yet another reason why i hated the gym: i don't like working out during the day and i love sleeping in too much to ever wake up early for a workout.5) Most every workout is only an hour and considering i am a full time student and have a full time job it gets pretty difficult for me to find time to workout, but since the videos are only 1 hour, i find it easy to always find the time at night to workout!yes i realize the above statements probably make me seem ridiculous, but i don't care, just more proof why these videos work so well. after 3 weeks i already feel stronger, my endurance is wayyy up and i feel healthier and happier :)hope this helps anyone who has any doubts!i was the queen of doubts, but now they are all gone thanks to the amazing epic P90X!!!"
490995,0,"Pros: comes with an air gaugeCons: too bulky for my road bikeI bought this pump after I was out on a long ride and experienced two tube failures. I only carry two CO2 cartridges and soon found myself with less than manageable inflation due to a failure of the CO2 cartridge head. I liked the idea of an integrated gauge on the Topeak, so I bought it.When I tried to mount it to my Specialized Grand Sequoia road bike, I found I did not like the mounting options and the seeming bulk of this pump. I returned it and bought a lower profile pump without the gauge."

I usually eat one of these around midday when I'm being physically active, it truly does give you an extra little boost to help you meet your goals in an energetic but not frenzied way.

281019,2,These boots went on tight like putting nylons on an Elephant and don't cover the entire top or bottom of the fender.

102232,1,"These tools are very compact what has obvious benefits if you want to carry them with you at all times. On the whole, these seem solid and most likely include all tools one might need in event of road emergency. On the other hand, such miniaturization impacts the comfort with which these can be used, and if you plan to use them for everything (including more complicated repair), you may want to choose something ""more full size"".My use is what I described in the first part of the review, therefore I would recommend them to others mainly because of the ratio ""many tools in small package"""

343622,1,I looked at multiple tubes and cases from all of the vendors on the market and found this to be the strongest shell and design. I purchased this case primarily due to the ability to store rods with an overall length up to 7 feet 2 inches that works well for my spinning rods. The triangular tube shape also appears to be more solid construction and is less bulky than the Bazooka and other similar models. The handle and carrying strap make it easy to cart around. I also like the locking mechanism since this is made with real hardware that provides for two locks. Great product and travels very well.
98751,0,"This is my best rear flash light I have ever used so far for the visibility, strength and practice. However, this is not enough if you can't fit it in a visible solid place. If you have a seat bag like I do you have to give up either that or the light as the light will not be visible and will be blocked by the bag. Knowing that you can't just raise the seat randomly and your leg when spread has to be at least 10 degrees, this is a problem.It only comes with 1 typical mounting solution which doesn't work for my bicycle. The bracelet is not flexible and the light itself will not mount on just any other bracelets. If you want to mount it on the side bridge you may lose flexibility as the flash would have to point up and lose its famous sharp visibility. Unless you install it up side down, but then you may lose the flash on a bump or shock.I started looking for another bag to set it up somewhere else so I can install the super flash under the seat. Unfortunately, they don't mention this significant issue in the description.If you are buying the super flash to install it under the seat and you don't use a seat bag, then this is PERFECT for you and you'll love it."

200868,1,"I purchased this scope for an AR-15. In addition to the Eotech 512, I have BUIS (Back-Up Iron Sights). One very nice thing about the Eotech with the BUIS's is that I can leave the BUIS's up (in the deployed position) and still use the Eotech. In fact, it is very easy to zero the BUIS's once the Eotech is zeroed (just look through the Eotech and adjust the BUIS's until they ""co-witness""). It's very nice to have both sights available. So far, I have put about 500 rounds through the gun and it continues to hold it's zero perfectly. I purchased the gun for home defense, and don't plan on having to shoot more than 50-100 yards (I live in a semi-rural area), and for this purpose, the Eotech is fine. Just remember, it's a 1x scope, so on most paper targets at 50 yards, the little red dot will cover the bullseye of the target and a good part of the ""black"" portion of the target, so don't expect to group shots in a 1"" pattern with this sight--that's not it's purpose. However, rest assured that it is quite easy to group shots within a hand span on a target shooting from a standing position at 50 yards--lethal! I highly recommend this scope, and I plan to mount one on a Mossberg 500 as well (to shoot slugs). It's very easy to shoot with both eyes open, and not have the scope compromise the field of view. 5 stars!!"

I slipped and fell the other day when I was holding a warrior pose because the mat is SO slippery when I sweat. I've always had to use a towel for my hands but with the Jade I had to place towels under my feet so that I could stand on it. The rubber smell is not very offensive to me, I think that is a matter that will be different for everyone but it really doesn't bother me very much. I ordered the blue one and it is more baby blue than the grey blue it appears to be in the picture. Overall the structure of the mat is good quality; I'm just going to keep my hopes up that the mat will be better once it is more worn in."
440656,0,"These pants have a very wide elastic waist, but the pants are so wide that on a very thin girl, the effect is almost comical. I should add that my daughter is just shy of 10 years old, average height and on the thin side, and the size 1 fits her well lengthwise, but, as mentioned, the pants are really baggy. So, these might be great for a brawnier child.The weight of the fabric is as expected, not light, but not a super heavyweight pant either. Quality seems good. No apparent shrinkage, but I do not put them in a dryer."

363882,0,"The problem with these is that the liner inside fits in a way that the crotch of the exterior of the shorts rides really low, and creates an unattractive pouch in the front, like you are hiding some kind of accident in your pants. I don't know about you, but when I spend money on workout clothes, I expect them to be functional, but I don't think it's too much to expect them not to look weird. Other than this, the quality of the materials is great, so if you by chance have a body type that can wear these a bit better, I would recommend trying them on in the store first to make sure, which unfortunately kind of defeats the convenience of online shopping."

And since I only use it indoors, the ""40 degree"" is more than enough. The price is good, also a little more than $25 so that we have free shipping.The only con is: after I unfolded it, I couldn't fold it back as small/neat as it previously looked. I almost couldn't put it back to its box (if anybody wantted to return it). OK, it was an mean thing to say about the comforty sleeping bag.btw delivery was fast.

266312,0,"This rig is pretty good for the price. I have one major complaint - the Velcro retention strap on the inside has a very hard corner, from where it was melted to prevent fraying. This tends to dig into your leg, causing discomfort. A thick sock helped, but it does become uncomfortable after a while. If it weren't for this, I would give it 5 stars.I will say that it holds the pistol very securely to your leg, and it does not move about. I think it felt just as secure without the upper strap as it does with, but I also generally wear it inside a pair of cowboy boots. I bought the size 10 and it fits a Colt Mustang and a Taurus TCP, both in 380, very well."

171963,1,"First, great job to Amazon for a very speedy process. Between ordering and shipping all went smooth and quick. I always shop on here before I go to a local retailer. Now the Kershaw Ken Onion Red Blur knife, great. Absolutely not a single bad thing to say about it. The day I got it in the mail, it was the sharpest knife I've seen. I carry it in my pocket and use it all the time. Cut food (of course after cleaning the blade off with soap and water, then some rubbing alcohol. Sometimes toss in a good 2-5 minutes over a flame too.) like it were melted butter. My wife loves to burn our meat and pizza and this knife still sliced and diced with ease. At work, I can't find a thing this knife won't go through! I bought this knife around six months ago, the blade is still razor sharp, the spring is strong as ever, and all the bolts are still nice and snug."

94322,0,"I am mounting this rack on a 26"" Schwinn Breeze.Mounting holes are a #10 and I drilled them out to 1/4"" to fit the holes where my rear fenders attach to the frame.The mounting bracket is included. A pleasant surprise to me! Wasn't sure if it was.Looks exactly like the one that someone sells separately for $2.99.The bracket is where I had problems.Bracket is a little short for my application and thus,the rack sits more at an angle rather than flat like I would like it.I would like it more parallel to the ground.All in all tho, not a bad rack. Fairly good chrome/ workmanship.Rack is kind of on the short side and could have been a little longer.Screws were too short/ small."
146932,0,"I wouldn't rely on this as my only source of hydration, but it's small and ideal for lightweight use. I wanted something small and compact to wear under my jacket when snowboarding. This is very comfortable and not too bulky. The zip pocket fits a Luna/Clif sized bar easily, plus money and ID as needed. The straps are very long and when tightened all the way the pack rides high on the shoulders. I've had to bind up the spare nylon with rubber bands to keep them from dangling.No leaks, no drips, good seal on the mouthpiece. Easy to clean, doesn't pick up odors, but a little hard to handle. The tube attachment is a little difficult to screw in and out, but no more than any other similar design. The bag is a little flimsy and I worry the plastic could rip if handled roughly."
149547,0,"We bought two of these for a Lara Croft Halloween costume. When they arrived, I was disappointed but not surprised to find that the tips of the guns are painted orange as per US Law. Some of the photos show a black tip, which would enhance the ""believability"" of the costume, but it isn't a huge deal.One other negative seems to be durability. While the gun feels very solid in the hand, and is quite hefty, it turns out to be pretty fragile. My wife and I collect movie prop replicas, so we bought these with the design of adding them to our collection after Halloween. We had them hanging from the wall about 4 feet up, and my wife brushed against one of them, knocking it to the floor. The top piece of the gun came off the main body. Springs and bits of plastic were everywhere. It took me about an hour, some specialized hobby tools I have, and quite a few choice words to get the thing back together again. It's just like new now, but before you pistol whip someone with this bad boy, make sure you take into account the hours of reassembly time (as well as the assault and battery charges) before you do it.I loaded and fired the gun once just to make sure it worked. It was actually pretty powerful for an airsoft gun. All in all, these were perfect for the costume and look great on the wall. Expect for that orange tip."

I thought the handle would extend more than it did, so if you have a taller child you may want to look into other models of this scooter. My kids are on the shorter side so they will get a bit of usage out of these scooters. Overall we are satisfied and the kids are having lots of good times."

267467,2,"I did not buy this thing from Amazon.com, but I did purchase one a little over a year ago from a local bike store. This trainer is awesome for riding at first - you will never find another trainer with such a realistic road feel. However, within two months the happy turned to horror as the friction-resistance pad began to wear. I would be riding along at a great pace and suddenly the unit would become so hard to ride I would have to stand on the pedals, then just as suddenly as it came, resistance returned to normal. This continued on and off for about a month, then one day during the middle of a workout the unit locked down completely. I disassembled the resistance unit and found that the resistance pad, which is made up of some sort of rubber material and resembles the brake pads on a car, had worn almost clean to metal. The time from opening the box and the first ride to total failure was a little under four months.Overall, I would have to say that the quality with Blackburn trainers leaves a lot to be desired. The unit that I got as a warranty replacement, the Blackburn Trackstand Fluid, is also knocking on deaths door, again after about four months of total riding usage."

38424,1,"I replaced my 12 to 53's (also Elixir) with these custom lights and simply love them. I basically went to a lighter string for comfort, more than anything else. I think I've tried every string made (maybe a slight exaggeration), and have no desire to further experiment. Simply put . . . these work! As with all Elixir polyweb strings they have a tendency to look a bit worn or tattered as you use them over a period of time, however, they keep their tone, reduce squeak and are comfortable to use for acoustic guitars. They do last! I currently use these on a Rainsong, which is carbon fiber and has a tendency to amplify string squeak due to the guitar construction. Being a loud guitar to being with, you lose little volume (if any) going from 12 - 53's volume wise.I also used Elixirs on my Gibson SJ-200 and Southern Jumbo (12 -53's) and would never Considered anything else."

480577,1,Not much to say about this simple product. Its lightweight and fits securely on me. I would recommend this product to those who want to stay safe while running or cycling.
188611,0,Does what it should. Only complaint is that I accidentaly 'crimped' the back pad above the point where the white metal ends. Now it sags a bit.
399092,1,Great value...tripod sucks though. You will have to get a better tripod which I already had. Field of vision is good and it does work in the rain.
274998,0,"Nice, but far thinner material than an older identical style number. I was hoping for the heavier version but these will do for light duty. Minimal shrinkage in sleeves as well as overall length and width, but they WILL shrink."
320125,0,"The clipless part of the pedal is excellent, but the platform/caged part leaves a little to be desired. If I were wearing hard soled shoes, they would be perfectly fine. But if I'm just wearing flip-flops or other light weight summer shoes(I'm a female), they're not at all comfortable on the foot. The clipless part of the pedal raises up from the middle and you can feel it through your shoe. I certainly wouldn't want to ride more than a few blocks with that protruding into my foot. Next time around, I'll just buy regular clipless pedals."
440348,0,"These are decent pants. The wide elastic band is very comfortable. I had to modify the length and bell of the pants as they are a bit ""disco"" for my taste. The price for the pants is good, but the shipping and handling charge is excessive and a bit slower than other companies."
62183,1,"I bought this for the gym, so that I don't have to keep taking the cap on and off of my normal glass drinking bottle. I was using glass because it's safer than plastic, at least plastic that *unlike* this one is not ""BPA Free.""Unfortunately the rubber bite valve is a huge pain in the butt to use...you have to bite down hard in order to keep it open while you suck the water out. NOT quick, easy, or pleasant at all.Fortunately, the bite valve is easily removable, which leaves you with what is basically a bottle with a large sturdy straw that (unlike a normal straw) you can close and seal. Much, much better than using that damned bite valve!So, I am happy with the lighter weight, unbreakability, and convenience of this bottle compared to using my usual glass quart bottle!"
501212,1,I like it a lot fits very nice and the color is also good. The delivery time was good too. I look fforward to the warm summer months wearing this swimsuit.
153199,1,"I use my tackle box to store beading supplies. It has ample space and partitions for all findings with room to spare. The upper part, under the lid is perfect for storing beading tools."
336796,0,"The picture of the Blazers reverse mesh is the wrong color. In the picture it is black, however the jersey I actually received was red, disappointing as I would rather have had black.Other than that I received it in a timely manner and the correct size etc..."
259099,0,These goggles are ok if you are an occasional swimmer with a smallish head. These kept popping off my big noggin and the strap is at its last little plastic holder. Looking for a two strap google with the adjustment in the rear now.
344739,0,"I PURCHASED THESE PANTS AND THEY WERE NOT TRUE TO SIZE. I WOULD PURCHASE THEM AGAIN, BUT WOULD GO 2 SIZES UP THE NEXT TIME."
184302,1,"Great board. My roommates and I play all the time. We get bounce outs every once in a while but only because it hits the metal wiring. And some of the metal wiring(around the bullseye) is coming lose but it goes back in easy. The darts it comes with are satisfactory with me (amatuer dart player), although the plastic breaks when getting hit by other darts. I already purchase new darts and they are en route.Overall, this product is great for leisure dart playing."
399526,1,"These sunglasses do a great job of reducing glare and, surprisingly, fit very well. They are my first pair of polarized glasses and are worth the money."
150774,0,"This LaFuma bag packs incredibly tiny; the (noncompression) stuff sack it comes in is only slightly larger than a Nalgene quart bottle, it's incredibly light (1 lb 4 oz), and for certain very specialized uses where being able to fit a summer weight sleeping bag in a pants cargo pocket (or a water bottle mesh outer pocket in a daypack) it's probably ideal. It's so thin (maybe 1/2 inch or less total loft?) I question whether it will work at 45 degrees. The stuff sack has a handy temperature range chart which shows the LaFuma's 'comfort' range as 54 degrees and above; between 54' and 45' the wearer is 'in transition' (which I interpret as 'no longer comfortable'; and from 45 degrees to 23' the wearer is at 'risk' (of hypothermia, I suppose). It's summer now, can't currently test it out below the 60's, so I can't fairly assess its warmth potential. If you want a 1lb 4 oz mummy bag that almost fits in a Nalgene bottle, and you're confident that you're going to be indoors or inside a tent, out of the wind and that the temp isn't going to break much below 55' (according to the stuffsack temp chart), this might be the perfect choice. Mine came with a glow-in-the-dark zipper pull. 'Tactel' lining fabric, which I wasn't familiar with, feels like a smooth nylon, almost like silnylon. Stitching's good."
471481,1,"I bought 2 pairs to bring to burning man and they were great. during the day I used the tinted plastic, and at night I had to change it to the clear one. They're kinda hard to snap on and off, but thats better than them just falling off. they saved my eyes."
143807,0,"I haven't had a chance to ride it yet, but here is what I noticed right off. It says it is a women's bike. I am 5'5.5"", and it is a little small for me. Also the bike in the picture is blue and the one I received is red/silver. It reminds me more of a boy's bike."
292353,1,"It's a good purchase for the eco-friendly environment. I am trying to introduce in my family not to use the plastic water bottle and use for of the Klean product. I am very happy with the product but one problem I have with this , it does not fit in my car cup holder. I need some lean and less circular product from Klean. otherwise it's cool..."
229464,2,"I bought a pair of these shoes for martial arts practice, and over my years of practice have never felt shoes so bad.There is so much padding on the bottom of the shoe, I couldnt feel anything at all and because its made of a rubbery material it bends in the wrong way when holding stances.This is just a cheap poor quality shoe and terrible for any purpose I can think of...even for light practice."
134693,0,"Works well, cleans guns fast for right after shooting.Still need to clean gun with brushes and solvent, but now you can wait to do that.Made in China - They should tell you that up front."
105736,0,It did not fit my aftermarket 45 deg site and I had to chuck it up in the drill press and file/sand the diameter down a bit.
421027,1,"Very easy to use and I find it faster than walking off yardages. I highly recommend this device to anybody who is good enough to need to walk off yardages. If all you do is look for the nearest yardage marker and then estimate the yardage, then it probably isn't worth the cost. The slope feature is also very useful on hilly courses. It has significantly helped my golf scores."
494670,2,"I cannot use any of those painballs. They are all damaged. They have all sorts of forms but round isn't any of them. I guess will will accept my loss and just throw them away. The seller ActionVillage also never responds to any email requests. Also, those balls are the same that they sell at Walmart. Walmart paintballs are the worst one can buy. Splash or Gab paintballs seem to be the best calls one can buy at a reasonable price."
54676,0,"I can't speak to accuracy for live fire or ease of sighting in because I only use it for dry fire training. For that, it's perfect because it's CHEAP! I like to use it during dry fire practice to see how my trigger pull is affecting my aim. I do this without even aiming, but just pulling the trigger on a snap cap and seeing how well I'm isolating my trigger finger's movement. It's perfect for that."
308544,1,"I feel it's a good and well made product. The problem is when ""working out"" becomes fun you will tend to over do it. I have blisters on the insides of my fingers - so watch out for that."
235492,0,"The segments are supposed to progress in difficulty as you work through the discs, but the workouts are basically the same difficulty. Good for a day when I don't have time for a real workout. I can always squeeze in a 20 minutes quickie."
156105,1,"Very comfortable. However, they were a little shorter than I thought they would be from what the picture shows. I plan on buying more."
229227,0,"Unfortunately this shoe comes in a medium width and I need a wide width for comfort. Out of the bag, it has a very ""chemical"" smell and needs to be aired out well before use."
147415,0,"What I received was 10 mylar blankets in plastic bags. The blankets fold into a 3"" by 4"" by 1/4"" package and are in 10 small zip-lock-style plastic bags. Each unfolds to the full size (roughly 80"" by 50""). The mylar is silvered. It is extremely thin and fragile. It is very easy to tear even accidentally. It wasn't possible for me to re-fold the blanket small enough to fit back into the small plastic bag.These might be useful for hiking with a backpack or some other situation where reduced weight and size are paramount, however they need to be considered disposable because they are so fragile. I recommend instead an all-weather blanket."

160056,0,"Skates are super cute with pink and periwinkle wheels. My daughter is 7 and skating lots- asked rink to loosen wheels so they go faster, said they can't go any looser...and that is why they are inexpensive. Good for beginner skaters but would not recommend for kids who will skate frequently. After a month I already feel she has outgrown the ""speed"" of them."
14599,1,"EXCELLENT WATCH. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. EASY TO WEAR, TAKE ON AND OFF QUICKLY WITHOUT HAVING TO FASTEN STRAPS.AS ITS MADE OF PLASTIC DOESN'T CAUSE DERMATITUS (SKIN ALLERGIES)THIS IS THE 5TH ONE OF THESE I HAVE BOUGHT( I HAVE AN ORANGE AND GREEN ONE AND NOW THIS BLUE ONE) I LOVE THEM AND I WOULDN'T BUY ANY OTHER TYPE OF WATCH AGAIN .WELL PACKAGED AND SPEEDY DELIVERY AS USUAL."
31955,0,"Case is flimsy and latches aren't the greatest. Foam protectant inside is thin and not glued down. When you open the case, foam has a tendency to want to fall out. Holds my Winchester 1300 shotgun 18"" barrel pretty good with plenty of room for shells and chokes. Good enough for transport in your vehicle but I would not trust any other means of transportation where it may get bounced around. Best part, I got this case in a yard sale for $3 :-)"
476355,0,"I've had 4 dri fit shirts from Russell and am very pleased with it, until I got this one. This shirt was shorter than the others despite all of them being XXL. This one has a thinner material as well which makes me feel uncomfortable when I wear it out. And the picture is misleading as its similar to the previous shirt I bought. I've realize the mistake and decided to wear it at home since its such a hassle for me to send returns from my home country. I've printed out a reference of the shirts I wore and will look carefully before purchasing. I wish that all the sizes across the various models of shirt of standardized so I don't have to double check and or worry that it won't fit me and its easier for me to choose the models I want to buy to wear."
413836,2,"I ordered this item on Dec.12,2010 and on Dec. 13 received confirmation that it had been sent and would arrive between Dec.17th and Jan. 4th 2011. When it had not arrived by then I checked with the postmaster and she said I needed a tracking number. I e-mailed lola teacher and asked for one and did not receive an answer. Two days later I e-mailed again asking to please notifiy me if it had been sent, no answer again. On Jan. 11th I notified my credit card company and they will investigate. This is the first time I have not been satisfied with a person selling on Amazon. She had a good rating when I ordered this item. I hope Amazon will remove her as a seller. I feel like if there had been an emergency that she couldn't send it I should not have received a confirmation it had been sent. If she actually sent it then she should have answered my e-mails."
256817,0,"I really like this shirt but the XL is a Medium, at best. With Jockey brand t-shirts, I wear an XL so I was hoping it would be ok. I'm going to order an XXL & hope that it fits."
488188,0,"It would be nice to have a listing of the items that actually come with the gun. I am pretty diligent when ordering online and I didnt locate the scope as not included. I would think that the scope is a pretty big thing to come with a sniper rifle and it is in every picture. My bad, I should have read the reviews that others had said the scope did not come with the gun. Just make it easy Amazon, and list the items that are to come with a purchase and make it very visable on the site when purchasing."
184965,2,"I bought the bottoms for my husband who is 6'2"" and they only went half way up his behind. I bought a large which is his correct size but they just weren't long enough. It's too bad because they were thick and looked really nice. I wouldn't recommend these bottoms for a tall person."
61583,1,"We were looking for BPA free bottles after the recent news articles about the chemical. This bottle is a great, cheaper option, than some of the steel bottles out there. You'll have to decide if the mouthpiece is for you. I have other Camelbak products, so I was familiar with the bite valve. My wife on the other hand doesn't really care for it. There is that slight ""plastic"" taste, but I tend to dribble on myself with the wide-mouth bottle, so this was a good option. All in all, a good bottle for the office or a lite day on the trail. It doesn't fit in a cupholder in our car. It's really close, though, it would have been nice if it were a little slimmer and a bit taller to accommodate."
157365,0,"I like the idea of this seat, especially its width, but I also feel less secure while I'm riding. I had no idea that I was using the horn/nose to balance and stay on the seat, but I must be. I probably could become used to this one, but life is short, so I've chosen a wider seat with a horn."
451736,0,"this is perfect to have in a bedroom or office. for the price this works out great. i would have liked a 1/2 hr fire rating or little bit more heavy duty. perfect to keep out younger children or kids but to keep your valuables, get a real big gunsafe for that. you nedd to use logic, dont put $5000 worth of stuff in a $60 safe :)"

270306,1,"This product worked exactly as Polar says it is supposed to work. This is by far the best monitoring system I have used yet. After doing the simple calibration, this device has had spot-on accuracy even on 7+ mile runs. I use to have a Timex Speed and Distance system, but it was not very accurate and would not work under a canopy. The only disadvantage witht he RS200SD is the battery life of the foot pod. Its only supposed to last 20 hrs, doubt it will work with rechargeable batteries. This is the only problem with this system, functionally an excellent system!"
53450,0,"Small, easy to use, accurate enough, but the clip is very, very easy to knock off. I have dropped it several times, and finally sent it flying into a bucket of water. It may recover when dry (or may not), but I would like a much better fastening mechanism."
283327,0,"I love this watch, but I have had to replace the pins in the band 20+ times in the 4 years I've had it. It is a ridiculous pain and I am going to go ahead and just get a new watch.The jewelers I've spoken to all say that Seiko does a poor job designing their watches and that pins shouldn't bend and break in a properly fitted watch.Buyer beware...and e-bay for $200."
486306,1,"I bought this backpack to have a small book bag for school and everything else. Right now this bag is holding up pretty well. Its withstanding my everyday abuse of 2 large textbooks (like ""microbiology"" large) and a full binder. Good pack for general. of course it may not last forever, but the material seems light enough so it shouldnt be that hard to repair or sew if problems happen in the future."
456324,0,"First of all, this item arrived last night, so I haven't yet had the chance to test it on a run. However, I wanted to let other customers know that the item is not as pictured. Rather, what I received was the other Nathan Elite 1 Plus pack, gray, viewable on Amazon. Rather than the nutrition flask being stacked on the 22 oz bottle, the flask is angled to the left side of the body while the 22oz bottle is angled to the right side. In addition, I considered both versions of the pack, but ordered this one because of the bottle positioning, but also because the pocket on this pack appeared larger than the pocket on the other pack. The pocket on the pack I received is pretty small and I'm not sure if my cell phone is going to fit in it, much less the phone and my keys. Overall, not pleased. If the company is going to sell an item, they should make sure the image matches the item they are selling. I'll probably keep the pack, but won't buy from this seller again as I can't be assured I'll get the item I actually ordered."
304315,0,The enclosure went up fairly easily. One drawback that the net has is that you have to tie yourself in once you get in. There's no velcro or magnet or simply an overlapping mesh doorway/portal to get onto the trampoline? Who wants to tie themselves in once they get onto the trampoline. We simply leave it open and there's a little area that's not fully netted. That's all.
465583,0,I am disappointed with this product. The bottom compartment zipper broke; I've had to sew the compartment closed. The back straps are coming loose.
321819,0,"I love this bag. I purchased about a month ago. I tried to put my laptop in it today and it doesn't come close to fitting my 17"" laptop. Now I have to buy another bag."

463927,1,"I've had one of these display cases for over 10 years and it has held up very well. It can hold up to three 1:35 scale model tanks, depending on how wide each model is. The case has clouded some over those ten years, but it does it job very well and keeps all the models inside free from dust and keeps little fingers from touching them.This week I picked up a second case for new models that I have just completed. The new case is one inch taller than the old model case which helps with taller models. This new case seems to be made of the same materials as my original, so I expect that it will give me many years of service also."
178902,0,"The knife has always been in my pocket since I bought it. The handle feels nice, the linear lock works well and it looks nice. I used it for all kinds of cutting and it performed ok for a little while. As of late the blade doesn't seem to hold an edge as the other reviewer mentioned. The clip broke off and I have tightened the screw that holds the blade in the body of the knife and even resorted to loctite to prevent it from coming out. That fixed that but the edge seems beyond repair and the belt clip broke ages ago. If you need it for box opening great but if you need it for anything from boxes to chafe tape to scribing metal I would suggest looking at others."
68289,2,"A waste of money in my case. The product was not very functional and was repeatedly reapplied before giving up less than a week after it was received. Great in theory, but ONLY in theory."

354554,0,"Feiyue states in their promotion that Shaolin monks and masters order this product. Indeed, the shoes allow your feet to grip the earth and serve their purpose well. But, they commonly come off your feet, the metal eyelets come off, the soles and sides of the shoes break open. The Masters use their leg wraps as stirrups to keep the shoes on. The No. 1 consumer shouldn't have to improvise on the product. It's been a long standing complaint that Feiyue needs to update their construction."
276043,0,"I bought two pairs of these sweats. One is fine today, the other experienced shrinkage in one leg of nearly 2 inches!!!! Also, fairly baggy in their cut. The material is very thick though, probably moreso that most comparable products out there."

256172,1,"I bought this item always wanting the benefit of inversion. It comes as advertised. Easy install of the rack. Boots are easy to put on. It takes a little getting used to the boot pressure on the bottom of my shin, but is as comfortable as can be expected."
166002,2,This knife is tiny! I can't even peel an apple comfortably with it and my hands are not that big.
487195,1,"I have played with a number of different balls, and these beta Ti balls go as far as any others. Subjectively, it seems that more of my balls stay on the fairway when I hit these off the tee, although that may only be my perception. Certainly I can not notice any difference in my game when I use these, although I am not a scratch golfer by far. The other advantage is that at this price, it does not hurt me twice when I lose a ball, like it does when I lose a more expensive ball."

143569,0,I purchased the gift pack which consists of live pepper spray and dispenser along with an inert practice unit. I liked the design which allows it to be sprayed at any angle as opposed to standard designs which are like aerosol spray cans with the nozzle on the top. This is supposed to allow you to fire Spitfire from the hip. I tried this at the park with the inert canister and was shocked at how little range this had. I think trying to spray this from the hip at an attacker in front of me hoping to hit their face would fail. It might be useful if you hold the dispenser right over their eyes but that's too close.I e-mailed spitfire asking if the inert practice unit replicates the real thing as far as spray pattern and got no response.I'll be carrying something like Fox Labs since spitfire doesn't inspire confidence at least for stand off range. I don't want an attacker so close when I need to use the spray. Spitfire says most attackers occur within three feet. I'm not even sure this spray will reach that far.Please if you purchase Spitfire also purchase a practice inert test canister to make sure you don't get a surprise at how close you need to be to use it.

317024,0,"I bought 10 different color pair of these gloves. I love all the fun colors, but the gloves showed significant wear after only one time. They looked worse and showed more wear than gloves I've worn for months. The gloves appear to be very thin or weak material. Too bad because I love the fit and the color choices."
498224,1,"My husband probably thought I was goofy when I ordered him these underwear for Christmas. But, I couldn't get past the ratings. They were so touted. Wow, my husband was not disappointed.

495205,1,"Edited Feb. 2012 - We purchased two of these whips in the hopes of being able to make a toy, similar to cat toys, that would stand up to our now 2 year old Border Collie mix rescues, Nougat and Cooper. Something that they could chase and play, using their natural instincts and as a bonus helped wear out their high energy levels. We have had these for these for well over a year now, they are very durable, being able to handle 100 pound dogs (they share when they go to the dog park) and have exceeded our expectations. We tied on a no stuffing type dog toy such asEthical Pet Plush Skinneeez Squirrel 24-Inch Dog Toywith a flexible cord but not too stretchy. These skinny toys have worked the best with the way they move and dance on the end of the cord.We move the handle(whip) back and forth, starting off slow, watch the dogs eyes and body language as they lock on to the toy and then let the fun begin. You can either stand in one place and spin the whip around you or trail it behind you, play some tug of war with it, the wrapped handle of the whip doesn't cut or burn your hand. We also used this in our 'drop it' training, make sure your dog is already trained to relinquish food or inanimate objects before hand, using this to reinforce that training. This is also great if you have or know someone with mobility issues. We have taken this over to a friend, to give him a way to play and interact without over exerting himself. He can sit or stand in one place, play tug with them, even in the house and they all enjoy it so much. And best of all no one is missing out, the dogs get to run and play and he gets to join in and contribute. If you really want to have a blast take these to a dog park and watch the different dogs join in. It is wonderful for kids, too! It keeps their hands and bodies at a safe distance from the dogs, and the kids love playing and being the leader of the pack. The best part is the way you get to bond with your dog.Wonderful and exciting exercise for your dog, a fantastic way to bond with your canine family member(s), we dare you not to smile and laugh when you see your dog in action!"
379194,0,"We have 4 Siggs- 2 adult and 2 kids. They really do protect the taste of your water- nothing like drinking out of a nalgene bottle. However, all of ours have dented severely after just a few days of pretty light use. We haven't even used them hiking yet. I can't see these bottles lasting more than a few seasons."
438376,0,"My hands are really small, and yet the small size in the gloves hurt my hands and cut off my circulation. I couldn't get the size changed despite this problem because sending them back would mean I would pay half of what they cost on shipping. I kept them and tried to stretch them and they are a little better, but they have ripped a little even though I have only used them a couple of times. Probably because they were too tight."
356398,2,"I am 125 lbs and this hammock should hold up to 300 lbs. One of the cheap ropes snapped in half on my 5th use of this item and I fell down, hit my head, smashed my elbow and hurt my back. Amazon being a company too large to care about the well being of the people they sell to would only give me a partial refund on a defective, dangerous product. I believe sending them my doctor's bills will be next as this has been a bad experience all around. DO NOT BUY THIS HAMMOCK! CHEAPLY MADE, DANGEROUS PRODUCT!!!!!!"

344753,0,"This is a nice product, just be careful with the sizing. My son wears a size 12 jeans and weighs about 90 pounds, he needs a size medium pants. I had trouble finding the sizing chart and ordered the wrong size. Also, the belt isn't a ""true"" belt in that it doesn't go all the way around the pants so you can't buy a larger size and just tighten the waist."
265012,1,I did not buy this chair from Amazon. I spent $... at a local store. Wish I'd bought it from Amazon (could have saved a bundle). I was shopping for a chase lounge for my deck. I looked at this chair and then looked at the price. My initial reaction was this is way too much money for a folding chair and I am looking for lounge anyway. Then ... I sat down in it! Boy are looks decieving. This chair was GREAT! I bought it without any regard for the price. I set it up on the deck and went to sleep. Work hard for my money and this chair earns it's price.

474188,2,"I got this watch in about April of 2007. I used it roughly 2 to 5 times a week for probably about 30 minutes to 2.5 hours at a time on each day, never doing anything underwater but just regular aerobic exercise and resistance training.The heart rate function worked decently well and tracked calories as stated. Like other reviews have said though, it is very sensitive to others around you that may also be wearing one and get really thrown off. Same with walking/jogging my dogs around the neighborhood, there were times that my heartrate would go to the 60 bpm range and then after half a block jump to the 200 bpm range - way off.In about September 2007, my heart rate would not go past 100 even though I would be working very hard. I thought it was a dying battery so I replaced those. That didn't help. I went back to the store where I got it and tried it with a chest strap from a brand new one, and it worked just fine. Turns out the transmitter from the chest strap just GAVE OUT. REALLY? I was appalled because I spent a little over $100 for this watch. LUCKILY, the store felt bad for me and just swapped it out for a new one.A few months later, in April of 2008, the SAME thing happened and all of a sudden the chest strap stopped transmitting my heart rate to my watch. I went back to the store and again they were willing to give me another new one rather than make me go through the trouble of sending the watch and chest strap back to the manufacturer for a repair under the warranty.What a hassle. I was saved from wasting my money on this thing only because the store I bought it from was so generous. Otherwise it would have been $100 down the drain on both watches. I'm expecting this THIRD EXACT SAME watch to breakdown a few months from now too, to continue the trend.I should have invested a little more money into a heart rate monitor and gotten a Polar, which most of my colleagues have and NONE of them have had the terrible experience I have had with the Imara."
391429,1,I LOVE this HRM ... I use it everytime I work out (5 times a week) and have been since I bought it (apx. 1 year ago). It never fails me. I LOVE how the cardio machines pick up the information from the belt! Although the calories burndt on the HRM are different from what the cardio machines say (I am not sure which one is wrong?). I do have a difficult time setting upper end/lower end HR but I need to read the instructions (WHICH are available on line - Yippee). I bought one for my son for a Xmas gift and encourage any of my friends to buy this ... For the price .. you just can't beat it! HAPPY HEART RATE MONITORING!

I used it once and then when I removed it from the bike rack, one of the rubber stopper/holder things on the bottom popped off as did the spring. Luckily, I was able to find both pieces and put them back on. It was about the third time I used the basket when two of the rubber holder things and springs fell off and now I can't find one of the rubber holders. It's frustrating because I think this is a great basket, but now I need to figure out a new way to attach it to the rack."

I have owned this unit for over two years and it is still working fine. The brushes do need to be replaced after repeated use, which is no big deal. Any mechanical device will have parts wear out, and the brushes are cheap and easy to replace. Park Tool makes a lot of good products and the cyclone is at the top of my list of favorites."

437014,1,"This is not my first springer pistol and I've had better ones, but if you're on a budget or you really don't care enough to spend $60 or more on a side arm, this is perfect. First off let me say this gun looks and feels awesome. It's heavy and looks very real, and comes with a U.S. Military seal on the handle and serial number engraved on the slide.Pros:-Fires 1.2g 6mm BBs very hard for a $15 gun (about 250 fps)-More durable than most cheap spring pistols-Looks and feels awesomeCons:-Jams frequently-Safety is merely aesthetic and doesn't work.To minimize jamming, move the slide fast and do not let go of it. Simply pulling it back and letting go will cause small parts in the gun to break. Once these break, you can no longer ready the slide without having your hand on it, even then it's only a minor inconvenience.So far I've had the gun for just over a week and it's broken on two occasions, although both times it was caused by the magazine injecting too many BBs at a time into the gun causing it to jam. Also, this gun comes apart without much trouble, and on both occasions I was able to fix the problem in minutes. This is the only thing that kept me from giving this gun a 5, because otherwise it's a fantastic buy at just $15."
455198,0,"The HRM- This HRM is decent at what it does. It sometimes is a bit slow to read the heart rate correctly, sometimes gets 'stuck' for ~10 seconds before it changes, and reads way high on occasion. That being said, it works ok most of the time. Gets the job done.Batteries- The batteries last about a month each (both the chest strap and watch battery), but keep in mind that I have to wear a HRM every day all day. Changing the battery in the watch is a pain in the butt, but changing the battery in the chest strap is easy.Chest strap and watch/wrist band- The chest strap is good, though the elastic does continually loosen as you continue to wear it. It eventually got to wear I had to cut and sew it myself so that it would not be so loose even when I had it tightened all the way. This chest strap does NOT have a faint beep with every heart beat like many others do. The wrist band is not terrible, but the Timex T5G971 and Polar FT4 have much nicer, more comfortable wrist bands. The watch screen on this one gets scratched up pretty easily.After almost a year of use, this HRM's beeper stopped working.The only reason I stuck with this one instead of the Timex or Polar is because the chest strap doesn't have the faint beeping with every heart beat. If the other ones didn't have that, I would use them instead for sure. I'll give this 3 stars because of the price."
122390,0,I bought this for my rec soccer team of 8 year olds...it comes with a black dry/erase pen but nowhere to put it...no velcro or anything so I had ot attach my own velcro to it with a string. Makes it much easier. It has 2 sides..one a full field and the other half a field. As longas you arent bothered by the loosey goosey pen then this is a good value for the money.

The instructions are terrible (I could have drawn better pictures) and I plan to call FP in the am and give them my complaint.Also--one of the most difficult parts of putting this seat together was dealing w/ the 'butterfly' straps. The straps are flimsy too and not what is pictured on the main page. This seat does not come w/ a 3 point plastic guard. It's merely yellow strapping material. Anyway, the straps do not fit thru the slots and after tugging and pulling w/ the pliers, the strap began to fray in several places. Yeah--like that will be real sturdy.So DO NOT buy this seat. If I had the $ to throw away I'd spend $... on the IN STEP 1-2 seater trailer I had seen at a specialty sports store.Also--the helmet inside the box is not the same one that was pictured. And it says nothing about a free book inside the box, so that was the only nice surprise.But I am sure we'll be returning this fiasco in the making.Melanie in NJ"

The hitting engine is pathetic and it's nearly impossible to see the pitches right. Every player has huge legs and a funny pasted on face that slightly resembles reality. The graphics are OK but older versions of MVP trump them...actually MVP 2005 kicks this game into the gutter. The fielding dynamics are frustrating as well, and there is very little control over throwing and jumping/diving. Then there's the management part of the game, trading sucks, and the whole roster management is fragmented to a maddening degree. My advice, wish this game had never been made and wait till MLB 2k6 or give up until EA can make MLB licensed games again."

461754,1,"I must say that I did not buy this cot for camping, but for everyday use. I bought a extra long twin mattress and needed a frame for it, and found it very hard to find frames that fit that extra long twin. I must say that putting a temperpedic type foam mattress on this caused it to bow in the middle. That's normal for a cot, as the fabric will do that. However, the fabric on this thing is very tight, and if you use it for camping I would recommend the mattress pad that Teton makes for it. For my needs I needed it to be perfectly flat so I cut a couple pieces of 3/4 inch plywood and covered them with upholstery fabric. They lay across the top and my mattress lays on top. It worked perfect and has a modern look to it, and I have tons of storage underneath. The frame is really well made and of good design. Great product!"
197753,0,"I just installed the Thule 400XT rack -- the original estimate of half an hour though was greatly off the mark. It took me about 2 and a half hours to install the first time. However, one I learned from my mistakes, it was a lot easier to install.The general difficulty I had was very fine tolerance the parts have in attaching them to my '01 Prius. For example, I had to load bars initially upside down (grip side down) which made a big difference in trying to do the initial lock with the tensioning cam (still required a lot of force though). Also, there was little extra leeway on the screws to attach the fit kit to the feet. Lastly, setting the final tabs in place took a while until I realized I could just get a plastic card and push them in while shutting the assembly. After all these hickups, I know how to set it up a lot faster. Othewise, solid construction and it doesn't look like it will move anytime soon."

It has 2 bottom zippers (a double)that do nothing and are not needed, one simple heavy duty zipper would have been great. You will have to mess with it to get it to zip up. (see other reviews) I spend at least 30 seconds to 2 minutes (yes 2 full minutes)to get it to zip correctly without damaging it.(The double zipper is very troublesome)This is not a conceal vest due to it's light weight, even the smallest of firearms cause it to droop radically to one side.The pocket zippers are very difficult to operate, you must hold the zipper end side of the pocket to unzip them, very small cheap nylon zippers.. I'm going to try to add silicone and see if they work better, but this is a cheap vest and I'll probably not use it much. Too much trouble to return. Save your money and find a better quality vest.This vest IS:Black, light weight and has 2 inside pockets. Lots of outside pockets and CHEAP! If you don't care that it takes a long time to put on and get it zipped up and want an inexpensive vest then this might be for you.Bottom Line:I'll probably not use it much.

This flaw can be costly to consumers; I have torn 2 tire valves while trying to force the Bell pump heads to fit correctly.

308444,1,"I have been using this powerball for a while after I received it as a present. This product is definitely beneficial to all types of users.Pros:- Wide range of speeds, as you get stronger you will be able to grip and spin the powerball better as the powerball spins faster.- Very compact. You can bring this thing anywhere, leave it in your car, leave it in your pocket, or leave it on your desk. The powerball doesn't take up much space at all.- It's very quiet. Although it makes some noise when you ""active"" the gyro, it's not annoying by any means or will bother anyone.- Does not use batteries or need lubrication. No worries about replacing the batteries or having to provide any maintenance for it. All you need is a string, a dock or a decent thumb to get the gyro spinning.- Lights up. It looks like a fireball once you get it to spin fast because of the energy used to light up the LED's inside.Cons:- Like other's have said, it's a bit tricky to get the powerball to start with your thumb or with a string but after about 3 tries you'll get the hang of it. If you have a dock then it's MUCH easier to get the gyro going.- I wish they had more colors for their powerballs."

I have small feet so I bought the small size which fit great, but my toes are too short to fit into these socks correctly. There is extra material that hangs off the ends of 3 of my toes on each foot. So if you have longer toes, you absolutely have to get these socks.

141200,0,For the price it's hard to complain really. The liner is basically a twill fabric that offers no real insulation. On the plus side the liner should be good for most any mummy style bag out there. I am 6'2 and this is plenty big for me and my bag. If nothing else the liner will just serve as a barrier between you and your bag so you don't dirty up your bag as quickly.
321954,0,"I paid $250, and for that price, I'm satisfied. The watch would be ideal if not for a couple of minor issues. First, the thickness. I love the diameter of the watch. In that regard, the size is perfect. But it's a little more clunky than I would like and I notice that Amazon doesn't divulge the thickness it the listing. My guess is they realize that this information may sway some buyers. Also, unless I'm doing something wrong, the alarm is only functional when the watch is in ""Alarm"" mode, which makes it unusable as a watch (pretty bizarre). Lastly, the on-line pictures make this watch appear silver but it is not. The titanium gives it a slightly different color.But the bottom line is that the watch looks great, is EXTREMELY lightweight, keeps great time, has a perpetual calendar, and never needs a battery. So if you can look beyond what I mentioned in the first paragraph, I think you'll like this watch."
490386,1,"This is a great assisted opener for the price. I also own the SOG Aegis and TF-7 Tanto TiNi, and this has great value for the dollar. The clip operates much better than the very difficult clip on the Aegis, and the Flash II also has an easier to operate arc lock actuator, which sticks out slightly more (but will not interfere with your pocket). This knife doesn't have as sure grip as the TF-7 or the Aegis, so I would not recommend it as a defensive knife, or for any kind of heavy use. If my hands are sweaty, I can feel the knife slipping in my hands.The most standout feature in this knife is how strong the spring is for the assisted opening feature. It is VERY STRONG, meaning it takes very little pressure to engage the blade. Because I live in California, this isn't exactly a feature I want, as there are very draconian laws regarding knives of these types. If law enforcement was to inspect this knife and give it a good shake with the safety disengaged, the knife would definitely open and it may be misconstrued as a gravity knife, which is illegal to carry in California. I've tightened my knife up an unch to remedy this, but the action isn't quite as smooth.Overall it has typical great SOG quality, and is a good candidate as an EDC or backup knife. Just make sure to adjust it if you are in California!"

They're normally not too baggy, falling down, or not fitting in those ""awkward"" areas.Either I've gotten to be a smaller size, or these shorts are knock-offs...because these shorts don't fit me like my other soffes. They're awkwardly baggy in the crotch, the bum isn't defined, the legnth is a bit longer than the others (even when ""properly"" rolled up).The main pro is that the material is very soft and comfortable.

Can't use it until I get rid of that smell as it really distracts from the class.

491365,2,"When I purchased this stand I was building a Cove Handjob MTBm which has an oversied downtube and standard bottom bracket. It worked pretty well for that project. However, I have 7 other bicycles of various types and materials and not one fits on the stand; not road or MTB, aluminum, steel nor carbon fiber, standard bottom brackets or BB30. They all must be jury rigged with velcro straps, rubber tubes, bubble wrap or other material and once jury rigged they are not secure enough for working on - no stability. I've tried everything. I just can't believe Topeak still offers this stand for sale. It's a waste of money."

It seems that all MFH2X60 series come in two flavors - 19 or 20 oz. If you really need to specify the weight, you'd better look elsewhere. On the other hand, this is a pretty good beginner cue stick. When the two pieces are put together, the center of mass is about 4.5'' from the top edge of the grip.

370811,0,"Knife is Sharp. Smooth aluminum handle. Positive locking when opened. Knife was stiff when arrived, I oiled it and began to work it many times and it began to loosen. Indent on back of knife is not very deep where you press down to close. Spring is strong and diffucult to press and hold. Blade must be wiggled to complete the closing. This would be an excellent small knife if closer was better designed, or maybe I got a dud. I'll stick with Benchmade folders as they seem to be much better thoughtout and implemented in their design. They are my best made knives.Update - lock spring has loosened a little more where it will close more easily now. Took a few weeks of working it."

265569,1,"I've owned this shirt for about 2 years and, although it's now beginning to show signs of wear, I've put it through it's paces. I even trained for and ran a marathon in it. It's a relatively thin, soft shirt that wicks very effectively. Many shirts in this category tend to use what feels like harsher, less cotton-like materials or construction. I wouldn't put this with the top elite (and high priced) training wear, but this Underarmour T feels natural and light and is reasonably priced."

I got this one today and the cotton is probably 50% of what it used to be. You can almost see through it compared to the old Russell shirts. I think that a Beefy T-shirt is thicker. Disappointing for what they used to be. If you don't mind a thinner cotton shirt, this one is good."

Unable to get it back on or find a replacement band, I went looking around (my first mistake) for a whole new slingshot and found this. Seeing the price, I ordered it up and was pleased to have it arrive quickly and cheaply. Unboxing the product was the saddest moment of my life. The frame is made of hollow plastic, slightly thicker than an average shopping bag. The band snapped when I pulled it back for the first time. I am so sorry that this exists."

276210,2,When I got the trampoline I was surprised that it said that you need three people to put it together. Myself and my little sister put it together. I will say that it is very easy to put together. I came into problems when you went to move the tramoline because the trampoline base will move and fold so when you go to sit it back down it is not level or even with the floor. So each and everythime the trampoline gets moved you have to manipulate it tyo get it to sit straight. It is a hassel since it is moved alot because I bought it for my 2 and half yr old.

135983,1,"Fact: this will get you in amazing shape.Fact: it is insane, BUT in not so many good ways.I've been working out for a couple of years now and sometimes you just get stuck (see no changes) even changing the workout routine trying to ""shock the muscles"", so I quit the gym for a month and started this program. And it was a shock, I had no idea it would take so much effort and I mean this in a good way. There are lots of great exercises, many of them completely new for me.This will improve your cardio resistance so much and that means you'll get definition, BUT I couldn't help to MISS THE GYM, because you have to use your legs A LOT, so I felt like my arms and specially my back and shoulders were not getting enough workout.Then on the second month I felt like Shawn T made 3 times more difficult (instead of twice as hard), I know the program needs to demand more effort, but it should do it gradually.What's insane in a bad way:- there are way too many jumps, so besides being discouraging and a little boring is bad for your knees.- most of the push ups are late in the videos, when you are more tired (and for the girls who are usually not used to this exercises would make it just too much)- some exercises are just silly (just like 4 or 5), that's my personal opinion, I just didn't feel like I was getting anything done.BOTTOM LINE: great video, you HAVE to be in some kind of shape to be able to do this, it will get you results, it is a great alternative for working out, but you won't get the muscles the people in the video have, you need the gym or something like P90X to do that.Something just to keep in mind: since it is so demanding (really short periods of rest and long periods of exercise, unlike the gym) it would be better to do it fist thing in the morning, but if you only have time at night it would be almost twice as hard since you'll be more tired by then."

406153,0,"Since the last time I bought the Russell Dri-Power Sweats Russell has gone down in quality. However, I do want to say that Amazon and the company I bought the sweats from were fantastic with my order. Here is my review:1. Russell Athletic is now using less material and the sweats aren't as baggy as I like them. They are a tighter fit without any physical body weight changes on my end. (lol)2. I am not liking the ""Fuzz Factor"" when you first get the item. Seems like too much fuzz is coming off of the inside of the sweats. Even after the first washing.I haven't been able to test them out in the weather yet, so I cannot comment on that yet. If I can remember I will try to say something later if the opportunity arises."

133313,0,"I bought this racket because I've noticed my game leaning more towards defense rather than offense. There's nothing quite like returning a smash where the opponent put absolutely everything he has behind it. This racket excells beautifully at that. However if you like to hit a lot of drives and smashes, this is absolutely not the racket for you.I've used a number of Butterfly rackets - most notably the Seemiller and Carlos Chiu. This one has a flared handle that takes a lot of time to get used to and it's also a bit lighter than those other two. It also seems to have less padding. These all combined make for a great defensive racket but also makes it a bit rough offensively. It seems to be inconsistent in both speed and spin when trying to hit anything with power. With the Chiu, the ball always seemed to come off the paddle the exact same - hard - which made it tough to return smashes. The Seemiller was better than the Chiu on the defensive end with less power but with that come sacrifices on offense. The Kenji just makes smashing anything within 9 inches of the table impossible and also somewhat difficult to drive. It's fairly easy to chop back, but that (for me) is a bit boring. Overall it's just not satisfying for me to have to rely on the opponent to make a mistake rather than blasting one at him and not giving him a chance to even get his paddle on it.In conclusion, if you're the type that really likes to rely on defense to win games, get this racket. If you like to hit a bunch of drives and smashes, get the more powerful and higher-spin Carlos Chiu. If you like a nice mix of the two, go with the Seemiller."

361030,2,"NEW REVIEW: Don't get this trike. I hate it. My son hates it. My husband hates it. My husband tried to fix it. Invest your money in a Schwinn Roadster Trike. That's what we finally did last week. My son loves riding the Schwinn - he hates the Kawasaki Trike. We'll keep it to see if maybe later on he may venture to using it, but other than that we may just cut our losses and sell the darn thing!OLD REVIEW:I had purchased this trike for my son last year and I was impressed with the product. It was an awesome looking bike that looks like it would last a long time. He wasn't able to quite reach the pedals when received, but he liked being pushed around on it. So it wasn't used a whole lot if barely because we kinda got tired of pushing him around on it and wanted to wait till he could actually reach the pedals. Fast forward to this year. He is able to reach the pedals and is learning how to ride it (He is 2.5 yrs old at about 38 inches in height). However, recently when he attempted to ride it again, the pedals would move, but the front tire wouldn't. It would appear to slip. This really disappointed me especially the price we paid for it. So me being a ""bike mechanic"" as I had to learn to fix my own bike when I was little, I took off the front wheel and pedal, unscrewed about 10 screws and finally right in center of the tire was the problem. There were three long screws that were NOT attached to their washers and the plate. Because of this, there was no ""catch"" to rolling the tire. So basically screws and washers were rolling around inside the center portion of the tire, not attached to anything. It was a pain in the A%% to take apart and it's a pain to put it back together. You will need two people to do this. It's up on the work-bench. Would be easier if the pedals could come off easily, but I'm not going to mess with that. I'll try to upload a picture of this later on. At least it's fixable I guess. Perhaps Kawasaki should revert to a spoke wheels with rubber tires like a regular bike, but smaller version if anything needed to be fixed."
24362,1,"My son is a 12 year old die hard Pittsburgh Steelers fan. This helmet is awesome, he was so excited when he opened this Christmas gift.

The second time, an order fulfilled by ""Serious Steel"", I got some weights which feel a bit lighter and are not stamped with the Champion name, are not as comfortable to hold, have some sharp edges around the center circle, are dirty, and are labeled Made in China.

10324,0,"First off I'd like to start off this review by saying that like a lot of people have mentioned, the material is super thin. If you take a single layer up to the light you can see the specks of light through it. The collar portion seems to be a double layer though, and the vest itself is decently warm AS A LAYER. By itself, wind will cut right through the thin material and leave you cold. The vest does work well as a thin, insulating layer under a soft shell or windbreaker. The double thickness collar is nice because when you zip up the vest all the way it does keep your neck warm. I would have preferred if the entire vest was the same thickness as the collar though.For the Amazon price, it's not terrible. I'd probably pay a little more and get a Polartec fleece material vest though. Definitely not worth the $40 sticker price that was on the label. But if you plan to just use this vest as an internal layer then it's decent for the $25 price tag."
218499,1,"My wife and I just took this cooler on a short vacation in my brother's very dark-blue (read, hot in the sun) car. It kept things very cold for 24-hour periods if the lid is closed tightly (we did open and close it several times throughout each day; no problems as long as we closed the lid properly). It would probably have lasted longer than 24 hours at a time, but we changed ice every morning just to be safe.There were a couple of times it was left in that hot little oven of a car all day in a sunny parking lot in 85-90 degree temperatures, and everything was still cold when we got back to the car in the evening. Not bad considering the sides aren't really that thick.The lid isn't difficult to close, but it does need to be *closed*. All I mean is that it won't close with gravity; just push the lid down with your hand (it doesn't take much pressure) instead of just flipping it down and walking away.It also didn't seem to take much ice to keep things cold. We'd pour one hotel ice-bucket of ice into the bottom each morning, which was enough.The size is also great; it fits right behind the front seat of a car and still leaves room to open the lid. However, it is taller than it is wide, so you'll want to make sure it's held in place somehow (e.g., if you sit it upright by itself in your trunk, it's likely to tip over and spill during the drive.)My only caution is the handle. It seems strong enough to handle any load a cooler this size is likely to be asked to carry. However, if you hold down the cooler with one hand and lift on the handle with the other, you can feel it bend in the middle. It feels like it's actually two pieces of plastic, joined in the middle by the gray rubber grip. In that case, I could see it breaking if the cooler were to be filled with very heavy items. But again, it seems to do fine with what would be a normal load for this size of cooler.Overall this is a very good purchase and I'm very glad we bought it."
212597,0,The locking handle for the parent to steer doe not lock and the trike is constantly heading off to one side. I will have to lift and move the trike back to the center of the road to continue on. It made for a miserable ride. The sun shade also does not stay up. The attachment holding the shade is very flimsy and the shade kept leaning to one side and so I ended up removing it because it looked stupid. My son is almost 4 and does love the bike because he has always been short and this is the only trike that his feet reach and he is able to peddle on his own. It is way overpriced though (maybe worth $50)!

If you wear a size 7 or smaller hat, then this should be a great helmet for you. The dial adjuster on the back is super easy to use with the helmet on, and the cam locks on the side straps seem to be very secure. There's even enough length to the straps to leave some room for adjustment under my chin (which was a problem with my old Specialized helmet).Unfortunately, I'll be returning this and getting aBell XLV Bike Helmetinstead. If any of the Schwinn helmets on Amazon were clearly listed as fitting an XL head size, I'd stay with my loyalties."

95010,0,"I ordered this DVD, because I had done another one of T. Shaun's Insanity DVDs and thought this would be a good one. Overall, I think it's a good high intensity, 20 minute workout. My problem with it is the amount of time you spend on the floor doing push-ups and other similar exercises. There is also a lot of up-and-down off the floor. You need a lot of arm and back strength for this workout. I am a 46 year old woman, who is in pretty good shape, and I could not get through all exercises, because I don't have the upper body strength. I think there might be other high intensity workouts that are a little more female friendly."

I called Century for a replacement nut, but they told me to call Amazon instead. This is one of the drawbacks from buying from third parties. I called Amazon and they told me to return it. I am praying the new one they will send me will have the nut. I am not sure if this is a common problem. Lemons can be a headache."

I can easily look back up to 7 days and compare how many steps I took, far I walked & Calories burned. It can go in your purse, or you pocket- it doesn't HAVE to be on your foot.

343963,2,"OK, it looks and works great now, but it was a b**** to set up. Took me about 4 hours, I think, though if I had to do it again it would proabaly take only 1 hour (instructions are that bad). Really should take 2 people but I did it alone. As other reviews have noted, diagrams are wrong, and some things are really tough to fit together. Make sure you use something to remove the paint from the insides of drill holes or you'll never get some of the bolts to go through! My (nearly) fatal mistake was to put the top part of the pole on sideways. It seemed to be the only way to get it to fit together, so I thought it was right at the time, but when the time came to attach the backboard my error was revealed. It's a miracle I was able to get the thing apart with little enough damage to still make the thing stable when fit correctly. Anyway, make sure the little dimple points the right way and the holes on the very top (where the backboard will attach) are oriented laterally. I love the finished product, but hope you know what you are doing and have a tool kit."

143993,0,"I have the all black version of this knife and it's well made and works great, but not the most beautiful knife to look at (though some may find it attractive). I saw the grey version and liked the looks better, so I ordered one from Amazon. After receiving it I noticed right away that it was roughly finished and made grinding noises when opening and closing when compared to the black one I already own. I thought this was a fluke and returned it to Amazon for an exchange. To my utter suprise, the replacement had a saw cut about 1"" into the handle, and it was sealed in the Geber package from the factory like this!!!At this point I gave up and sent it back to Amazon for a refund and called Gerber customer service. After doing some checking, the Gerber rep confirmed that some of their grey versions were roughly finished compared to the black ones. The Gerber rep was very nice but did not offer any way to remedy this for me, as I still wanted a grey version that looked and worked like the black one I had.All this said, my black version is a fabulous ultra-light one handed pocket knife, better than even more expensive knives like Benchmade and Spyderco (I own knives by these companies too). If you get one in grey that works nice and doesn't look like it was unfinished then keep it! Gerber makes some other great and affordable US made knives like the EZ Out series which don't seem to have the quality control issues (the full size EZ Out is so good that I sold my Benchmade 551 Griptilian and kept the EZ Out).Get off your butt Gerber and fix this problem as this is a great knife that deserves better!"

It occassionally looses track of what it's doing and either underreports or wildly overreports. I suspect normal moving around breaks the sensors away from the body and produces the false reports. I am using electrode cream on the sensors, so it should be doing a little better than this. The sensing harness is comfortable and doesn't move around much.

187904,0,"I was taking a 17day trip to europe and my only luggage was one backpack.I compared the following backpacks: '06 REI UL30, '06 REI Catalyst 35L,'06 REI UL45, '05 Kelty Redwing 3100, '06 Gregory z pack, '06 Gregory g pack,'06 Osprey atmos 50, '06 Osprey atmos 35Testing:First off I recommend REI for backpacks. They have a very liberal returnpolicy which allows you test at home and then return. Also very knowledgeableand helpful staff.Some of these (REI UL30, REI UL45, REI Catalyst 35L, Gregory Z-Pack and Kelty Redwing 3100) I purchased and tested at home, them later returned.For these I packed exactly what I was bringing with me to europe. Total weight of pack was 23-25 lbs., then later returned. I also did instore testing on all of them by packing weight sacks equaivalent to 20-25 lbs and then walking around the REI store for 15 mins.This was an April trip so I needed some mild to chilly weather clothes.For reference as to how much the packs can hold, this is what I packed in each of the bags I tested at home and eventually what I brought to europe on my trip:1 pair jeans1 pair lightweight long pants6 pairs boxers1 short-sleeved tshirt2 long-sleeved tshirts1 long-sleeve columbia fleece1 tolietry kit2 paperbacks2 small top10 travel books (equal to 1 paperback together).2 undershirts6 pairs socks1 pair gym shorts1 long sleeved button down shirt1 sweater1 folded up duffel bag to use for return trip for souvenirs1 outlet adapter1 ipod power supply1 cell phone power supply1 marmot precip jacket (sometimes I was wearing this)I first wanted to see if everything would fit and then I put the pack on for about 15-20 mins. I also wanted to get a pack that was small enough to carry onto a plane. For sizing note that I'm 6'3 190 and always tested the large size which hold a bit more than the smalls and mediums. Also note that I bought 4 of the REI stuff sacks and put clothes in those. They worked great for easier packing.Backpacks Tested:'06 REI UL30 - $85Tested in store and at home.Very light. Not much in the way of outer pockets. I could just barely get everything into this. That's with really squeezing and putting most books in outside pockets.I really liked the skinny/tall feel of the pack. The support system and padding on the shoulder straps was not as full/quality as the osprey, gregory or kelty. But good enough for my travel needs and comfortable. Though maybe not if you were doing an all day hike. If it was a little bigger or if I was bringing a little less it would have been the winner.'06 Catalyst 35L - $90Tested in store and at home.Light. But not as light as UL30 or UL45. And no outside pockets at all.This fit everything. Nearly equivalent space as REI UL45. The Support system and straps a touch better than the UL30, UL45. Also has the skinny/tall feel like the REI UL packs, which I felt was more comfortable and makes squeezing into airplane and traneluggage compartment much easier. In the end, the lack of outside pockets and it being a touch heavier than UL45 was the reason it wasn't the winnder.'06 Gregory Z-Pack - $190Tested in store and at home.This was a grade up in size and quality from the others. Very light. Lots of outer pockets with a big outside net pocket. I easily got everything into this with plenty of room to spare. I could fit 1.33 times my load.Seemed to be very high quality. The support system and shoulder straps were a step up from the REIs. But it had a ton of straps. Straps everywhere. The staps were really a nuisance. I liked it and was very comfortable. But it was more than I wanted to pay and was also concerned it was to big to carry on a plane.'06 Gregory G-Pack - $150Tested in store.I really liked the outside big net pocket. And like the Z-pack was of high quality. It didn't seem to fit as much stuff as the REI Catalyst 35L and maybe just as much or a little less than the REI UL30. Also seemed to be a little small for me. It rode real high on my back and didn't rest on my hips. The large of this seemed to fit like a medium of other packs.'06 Osprey Atmos 50 - $200Just looked at in store. Didn't put on and test. Looked great. REI didn't have a large on the floor. The REI staff were big on this model and a couple of them said they had bought one for themselves. But I was 1.5 weeks a way from my trip and couldn't take a chance on it not being shipped in time. The OSpreys were my favorite as far as style goes.'06 Osprey Atmos 35 - $160Tested in store. Had a fantastic support system. In a class by itself for thesupport system. It was the first one I tested in the store so I was just gettingstarted in getting the feel of the packs. Didn't test at home with my exact stuff.But based on in the store testing it seemed to hold less than other bags of the samelisted size. I say this based on how many of those 'weight' sacks that the REI staffloads in the pack for you. You then go walk around the store for 15 minutes.The REI UL30 and REI Catalyst 35L each fit more stuff than this bag. This bag wouldnot have been big enough for me.'05 Kelty Redwing 3100 - $70 (on sale on REI.Outlet, normally $110)Tested at home. This thing fit a ton. It's got a different configurationthan the other packs. This one is short and wide. The REIs were long and skinny.The Osprey and Geregory's were in between. It easily fit in everything.Fit as much as the Gregory Z-Pack, maybe more. Had good/enough outer pockets for my liking. At first, I though it was great. Had a comfortable shoulder straps and good support system. After a while though it seemed a little bit heavier than it should have. Maybe it was because all weight was outward, because of the short/wide style. I was also concerned that it was going to be too wide to fit into the overhead compartment on a plane or at least to big to pass the size test to get it onto the plane. I didn't want to take that chance. Though the REI.Outlet price was a great deal.'06 REI UL45 - $100 - WINNERThis is the one that I didn't return.Tested in store, at home and on a 17-day, 3-country, 4-hotel, 7-train and 4-planeeurope trip. Very light. Very durable. Very portable. Very comfortable. Not much in the way of outer pockets. The lack of outer pockets is its biggest fault. It fit everything listed above. But without much room to spare. Though I could have squeeze in a few more tshirts and didn't fully utilize the top pocket. Like the other REI packs I tested it has more of a tall/skinny style. That fit better for me and also seemed to carry the weight easier. It rested on my hips correctly. Not much in the way of bells and whistles like the Osprey and Gregory's. Only one outside packing strap that locked the cover to the top loading opening to the main body. But that's all I needed to get it tight and squeezed in. I thought this was a pro not a con. Whereas the Gregory's had straps everywhere. The UL45 also has an internal strap to compress the stuff in the pack. It's also on the UL30. Not sure if that made much of a difference, maybe a little. This pack and the UL30 had the ActivMotion support sytem which means the shoulder straps on each side and the back suspension are one piece that moves together. I actually didn't think this was advantage for me. It actually seemed to make the pack more likely to be crooked on my back than the other packs. But not a big deal. And REI totes it as an advantage so maybe I was doing something wrong.As I said above the REI packs seemed to hold more stuff than other packs with the same listed capacity. This was a big advantage. More space for your money.Keep in mind that I generally did not have the pack on my back for more than 1hr at a time. Usually just from train station to hotel. Or walking between terminals in the airport. But during those times it was very comfortable, you forget it's on your back. Also very protable in terms of storing it in airplace overhead compartments and train luggage racks. I never had a problem. It fit with plenty of room to spare.This would be the perfect pack for me if (in order of importance)...1 it had an outside back pocket/net like the Gregory packs. and/or a little bigger outside packs2 it had a water bottle holder pocket or any kind of pocket on the hipbelt3 the support system was a little closer to the Osprey Atmos packs.I highly recommended the REI UL 45. This pack has worked out great for me. I plan to use it on other trips and on weekend camping trips."

I'm 5' 6"" (on a good day) and at my peak could dunk off two steps. The program works and the jumpsoles are much more effective than the Strength shoes. The proprioceptors are by far the best balance workout I'd had.Marriage, two children, and nearly thirty I'm starting it up again and recently purchased the 5.0 system. Pretty much the same as the original and just as grueling.I would recommend this product for anyone serious about testing their physical limits. If you follow the program it will be tough. You will see your vertical decrease before you see it increase. Don't be discouraged, hang in there, and trust me your perseverance will pay off in the end.If the above statement dispirited you, maybe these aren't for you."

The hard plastic 'feet' take some wiggling to get on, I had to tap them on with a soft mallet. The paint finish is pretty good (a textured dark gray), but as with most things made in China, I wonder if the paint contains lead or some other noxious ingredient. The item was packed pretty well, everything was wrapped in a thin padding material and the bolts, nuts and washers (shocker, washers were included!) were shrunk-wrapped to a piece of cardboard. The included instructions are clear and straightforward, but honestly, if you need instructions to assemble this product, you need to go back to school ;)I would recommend this product."

507241,0,"I bought the black model of this gun and my friend bought the black and silver (""black slide"") model. Beware: THE BLACK MODEL IS NOT NEARLY AS POWERFUL AS THE BLACK AND SILVER MODEL. I don't know why this would be the case....different internals maybe? I'm upset I bought the black model. For anyone wondering, we tested the black model and the black and silver model exactly side by side with the same BBs. We even tried using different sizes of BBs on both guns at the same time (.12, .20, and .25 grams.) Every time, the black and silver gun went farther. I do not know how powerful the silver only model is.Overall, it's a good gun, but the aim is almost useless. I like the magazine. I bought a speedloader to reload faster but it's not really necessary at all. Also, on this product page, the black model looks like it is the only one with the safety and the grip is cut a little bit differently. This is NOT the case. The black-only model and the black and silver models look exactly the same, besides the color of course.I would recommend buying the black and silver (black slide) model. Do not buy the black only model."

304061,1,"These mounts are specifically manufactured, and advertized to fit the Crosman 13XX series variable power pellet pistols (1300, 1322 & 1377) AND some other specific Crosman pistols and rifles (2240, 2260...). If you don't have one of these, then don't buy them and give them a bad review (or do your THOROUGH research first- but don't complain if they don't work for YOUR application).These are of good design to fit the aforementioned guns and are manufactured with close tolerances making a secure attachment 100% possible. There is no way these will ""normally"" become loose, or not fit on the barrel- even without shims or tape- unless you bang your attached sight (red-dot, scope, etc.) around or have stripped the screws. What some of you might experience is the slight movement of the barrel in the receiver which imitates a loose mount. And in RARE conditions you did find the need to shim in order to tighten the mount's grip, I'd place some plastic or metal at the TOP of the 3/8 (dovetail) ""rail"" in order to keep that area of the Intermount 459MT from closing in while you tighten the screws. This may, however, widen the ""rail"" some making your attachment of the sight a little more difficult. Make sure the barrel and mounts are oil and grease free before attaching! Also, if you over-tighten your scope, red-dot, etc. on the mount, you will, of course, loosen the grip of the mount on the barrel (DUH). If this occurs, remove the sight, carefully re-tighten the mount then re-attach your sight firmly but not too tightly.Although I don't have all the pistols this mount will fit, I do have both the Crosman 1300 Medalist II and the 1377 which the mounts fit perfectly and have a set each on both guns. Could they be designed better... possibly. Are they Mil-Spec... no. Could they be made of higher grade metal... of course... but then they would probably cost more than the gun they were designed for.So... I hope this clears it up for both those who claim they won't fit and those of you whom are indecisive on whether to purchase or not. Amazon has a good return policy and will provide a return shipping label if you do have (legitimate) issues... provided you aren't yelling at them when you contact customer support!Food for thought about any complicated process (like this): If you're an adult having a problem attaching these mounts, give it to a kid to handle... If you're a kid- give it to an adult to fix."

506442,2,I order this product for myself and one for my parents. Neither of them would even turn on. When I contacted the seller. Deals of today they said I would have to go to the manufacturer to return. I contacted the manufacturer and they have not handled this item for 3 years and had turned it over to another company. That company CT Global said since I bought it from a non authorized dealer they couldn't help me either. I have yet to hear back from Ebuyyxp to find out what to do. I think Amazon needs to be more careful whom they allow to sell stuff through them.
76253,0,"I bought these hearing protectors to use at the local gun range. They work moderately well, but I find the noise reduction not quite adequate for range use. These don't have enough padding to block out enough sound of even a 9mm, let alone the guy next door shooting a 500 magnum. They work fine for outdoor shooting.They also don't fit on my wife or adult daughter, both of whom have narrow faces. They only seem to stay on my big head (in more ways than one). Women or men with shorter or narrower jaws need to look at the over the head hearing protectors.On the plus side, the electronics do allow me to keep a normal conversation while shooting at the range, and their price is far below the pro version electronic hearing protectors."
215780,0,"It's a cool sports watch but setting it to tell time was a horror show that required a call to the help desk. The manual is totally unclear and seems to be written in Martian. Also, I got it for the heart monitor. Maybe it will and maybe it won't Yes, the chest strap is on right, the contacts are wet. Sometimes it works. Sometimes not. Sometimes it works for awhile and goes to two zeros for no discernible reason. I'm not sure at all this is worth the aggravation"

200607,0,So I bought this holster hoping that it would help me conceal my glock 19 at work. I have a great iwb holster but in a truck all day it is hard to draw. The holster fit the gun great and stayed on my leg nicely and was comfortable. The issue was the glock 19 was too large. it left a noticeable print on my pant leg and with a hiking boot on was a lengthy process to draw. I could see this holster working great on a smaller gun but the size of the g19 made my pant leg get caught on the draw and showed terribly.

159733,0,"Needed a smaller hydration pack for my son to take on an Encampment, this pack did the trick just fine and worked well for him. However, we let a friend borrow it to take to her camp about 2 months ago, she chewed the mouthpiece as if it were a piece of gum or something. :-( Saw the damage when she returned it, figured no big deal, just get another mouthpiece at Walmart... HA. No such luck. A person has to buy whole new bladder for $10 bucks just to get a new mouthpiece. Suddenly not such a great purchase any more. Not sure if better to blame Walmart for not offering mouthpieces or Outdoor Products for not having them available, but just putting it out there."
383853,1,Beautiful gun. It is shaped so that my hand (small) and my son's hand ( large) can both use it comfortably. We don't have to share because the price is so good.
419709,0,"This seat works great once installed. It is very comfortable for the child (my 2 year old fell asleep in it on the first trip out). Very secure with harness, foot straps and a pull down horizontal bar that then locks in place so I felt very comfortable with it. Balance is good. Rode 10 miles first trip out and had no problems.Buyer Beware!!!! My one complaint has to do with the included bike rack. If you have a mountain bike with disc brakes and quick release, it simply doesn't work!!! I only found this out after receiving the item and realizing there is no way for the Blackburn Expedition Plus rack included to be installed. After doing some additional research on the problem I found that Blackburn now sells a different version of their rack (look for Blackburn rack for Disc Brakes) that is meant for bikes with disc brakes but that is not what is included in the co-pilot box. So, I was able to purchase the modified rack on Amazon for $60 and at least get the seat installed but I feel cheated in that I feel like I paid twice for a rack for the seat (assuming the price of the seat would be less if it didn't include the rack). It would be especially useful for the co-pilot people to make it very clear their included rack doesn't work with all bikes but their box actually says ""Seat and Rack works with virtually all Bicycles""!!!! Talk about false adverstising. Very disappointed in this aspect of the seat but the seat itself is great."
113173,2,"This is a beautiful bottle and easy to fill but it leaks and that is completely unacceptable.

121719,0,Cheap way to buy dumbells but if you have worked out much before you will understand these sorts of dumbells leave alot to be desired-there is something about the feel of them in the hand and the oddity of their feel when doing arching movements like flies...they are ok with presses but with flies and curls they disappoint.It might be simply the solid one piece construction that does not allow the weight to shift through an arch but I have noticed the best dumbells in my hands have always been the ones which have multiple small steel plates on each end that fit snuggly together.

207972,1,"I've got plenty of cheap spinning reels, and decided to throw down some serious money on an expensive one, so I went shopping on Amazon. This reel came up, and I looked at the reviews, broke down, and ordered another ""cheap"" reel. One review said it was bigger than expected, and that sold me. I was looking for something bigger for macinaw and steelhead. Well, I loaded it up with 20lb test Spiderwire, mounted it on a medium weight older rod, and took it out on Flathead Lake. I was pleasantly surprised. It cast very nicely and was quite smooth. It's a simple reel, no bells or whistles. I nailed macs in the 5 to 10 lb. range, no problem. I'll find out what this reel's made of when I try it on Salmon River steelhead this fall. I'm a little suspicious of the drag knob. I'm not sure you can crank it down to a 20 or 30 lb. break. I'll find out. I figure that for the price, if it doesn't work out, I'm not out a lot of money. So far so good. I was a little disappointed to see that it is made in China, but isn't everything? I have nothing against the Chinese, I'm glad to see conditions improve for them. I only wish that an American company could turn these out. But, that's a subject bigger than this review. The 106 gets 4 stars for price, and effectiveness as tested thus far. If a 20 lb. steelhead destroys it, I'll let you know."
227696,0,"Some reviews for Dickies overalls indicate that the sizes run small. I found the opposite to be true, at least compared to normal jeans. A lot depends on what you plan to tuck under these - for a T-shirt, I suggest ordering your normal jeans size or even a bit smaller unless you are looking for a baggy look.The straps are a bit limited on adjustment possibilities. By default they are on a ""farmer setting"", i.e. with the bib almost to your chin, which makes the whole getup look a bit silly. If you get the right size and adjust the straps, however, these have a nice fit and could almost be mistaken for a vintage fashion look.Unfortunately, these are clearly made for work. The seams are untidy and the colour of the thread (red and bright white) is appropriate for garage only. Yet I am not sure these would last long in hard work, the fabric and seams do not seem that strong.Having said that, these are by far the best fitting overalls I have owned. Extremely comfortable to wear."
438181,0,"These polarized sunglasses really do effectively cut out a lot of glare to help me see more comfortably. They have a wrap-around design that helps them to conform very snugly to the contour of my face - I couldn't ask for a more comfortable fit. The rubberized grips near the tips of the arms help these glasses to stay on securely.These shades look sporty and sexy but not overly flashy. They are thus perfect not only for your outdoor actvities such as biking, but for everyday wear as well. I got the frame with the tortoise design - beautiful! It is actually a bit darker than it appears in the picture on the product page.They come with a protective semi-hard case and a microfiber cloth. The case has a hook for attaching to your belt loop, backpack, etc.I thought these were the best glasses I had ever owned. But, alas, after just a month, one of the lenses popped out of the frame even though I took very good care of these glasses by returning them to the case when I wasn't wearing them. Maybe there would be better quality control if these Bolle glasses were still made in France instead of China? Anyway, it was back to my trusty five-dol1ar Wally World ""Berkeley"" sunglasses.---These polarized sunglasses are functional, attractive, and comfortable but not very durable."

A minor inconvenience, easily taken care of. It does look nice, and has enough room in the XXL to wear it over my down parka when I photograph winter sports.

For my uses, the fishing vest my wife gave to me at least 20 years ago is still much better. The large, lower pockets are above the belt line, just right for larger lenses, and they don't get crunched between my body and guardrail or other hard object I am leaning over.

On the Humvee, the upper breast pockets are too small for lenses or flash units. But, it will make a great birding vest, methinks.Just my impressions after using the vest for awhile, but it may be just perfect for your needs. From the photos, my remarks re: pocket size may equally apply to the Humvee Travel Vest, too."

408882,0,From what I can tell this stand is a solid piece of equipment. My ONLY problem is I can't put it together. Nautilus sends you these screws which they apparently expect you to be able to tighten with a HEX screw. One a piece of equipment like this that you really want to make sure the screws are tight - it's impossible to get these things on. I've hurt my hand several times trying to tighten these things. As it is now - the stand wobbles back and forth. You would think they would know this is a BIG problem and would use REGULAR bolts or screws!! Until I receive some new screws from Bowflex - I can not and would not recommend anyone buy this product.Oh yes - like everyone else has said - the instruction manuel is AWFUL!!!
73935,0,"I called Muzzlelite before ordering the Bullpup. I told them I had a muzzle-weighted, 16.5"" barrel. Muzzle diameter was measured as 0.999 inches. I was assured by a technician that it would fit. I might need to do minor trimming.The truth is a little different! If I had a tool that could bore that accurately, I would be left with 0.04"" of plastic holding the sling and the front site to the remainder of the firearm! That reaming would go about 3"" into the Bullpup, so don't expect to use your trusty Dremel for that!I still kept it - just paid another $60 for a new sporter barrel (18"", so Bullpup meets federal regs) - and waited another week for that! I think that hurt the most. I settled for one with a front sight on it so as not to wait much longer than a week.Other than that, it is pretty well designed, and has lent itself to other fun modifications. That included putting a Weaver-mount scope on it. Although from the picture it looks like it could take an AR-15 mount, it won't. I expected that, though, and don't see that as a real drawback.I'm still having fun with it, and it does look wicked!"

64966,2,"This scooter is trash. I snapped mine trying to gap a 4 stair. If you just want to cruise around, this scooter is perfect for you. If you're obsessed with tricks like big airs, stair sets, bar twists, barspins, tailwhips, 180s, 360s, bri flips and more, you NEED a pro model scooter. They're faster, smoother, stronger, and lighter. There is no point in the wheelie bar, the deck squeaks and the bearings rattle when you ride it, and the folding mecanism just makes it heavier and less sturdy. If you want a good quality, cheaply priced pro scooter, I recommend the Razor Pro Lo or Ultra Pro Lo scooter. The handlebars are wider which makes it easier to grab them while landing barspins, wheels are much smoother and you get more speed when getting air off ramps. Or if you don't want the Razor Pro, just switch out the wheels on a kick scooter to faster wheels. (I recommend Demon or Yak wheels, you can get them at any scooter store. That's what I did, WAY faster and smoother!) Also with the Pro Lo scooter, you should change out the grips for ODI Longneck grips because when you're hands are sweaty, they'll slip and it's hard to grip the bars. ODI's are almost exactly like BMX bike handlebars. If you REALLY want a pro scooter, I recommend you start with a complete pro scooter like MGP or Slamm, they make great completes. Alloy wheels, better clamps and forks, and overall better performance. If you don't like the bar height, you can always cut the bar and make it smaller. These completes are available at any scooter store. For me, I'd custom complete a pro scooter which means buying seperate bars, grips, decks, griptape, wheels .etc and having the store employee put it together for you. I'll start with the bars. There are different kinds of bars including Twan Nawt, Viper and more, they come in different colors (My favorite is the rasta Twan Nawts!!!) Grips include ODI's, they're amazing, and have really good grip for doing big tricks. Clamps are better than the Razor's because its stronger and won't snap you get big air or gap a big set of stairs. Decks can include Phoenix or Blunt and come in different sizes depending on your skill level. Wider decks are great for beginners because it's easier to catch the deck when doing tailwhips. Smaller decks are great for pro riders if you love backflips, flairs and more. Griptape, it doesn't really matter just make sure it covers the whole deck for more grip while doing tricks. Wheels, Yaks and Demons are great wheels, they're faster, and smoother and just better to get more speed. The Razor kick wheels were SO laggy and slow, I switched mine out for Demon wheels. Brakes, I recommend the Fakey Brake, it's better for doing fakies and the brake doesnt rattle when you move around. So, the point of this review is to throw away you're Razor Kick scooter and go for the pro model scooters!"
469202,1,I bought it for my wife and she is very happy with this product. Good quality and perfect shape. Recommended.
63760,1,We own two of these scooters and I would highly recommend them. They are fun for the kids to ride and stand up to the brutality of our 10 and 12 year old boys. They are much better quality than similar electric scooters we have seen in this price range.

The Norinco ate one up with minimal effort, so the other two buffers are in a drawer, awaiting other later-model SKS's.Also, watch out when installing- the two forks on the upper receiver cover are sharp!As for in use impressions, the SKS has pretty minimal recoil to begin with, so I got this more to slow the cyclic rate a bit and reduce parts wear.

43350,0,"I searched for a long time trying to find a good waterproof pouch for holding passports etc while snorkeling at the beach. I was willing to spend much more than this pouch cost, but I couldn't find anything with really stellar reviews. This Kwik Tek Dry Pack seemed to get some decent reviews, although many said that water does get in. Others said that it was large enough to easily fit passports inside. Since I knew that some water would get inside of this, I put my passport inside of a ziplock bag, and then in the pouch. It was hard to fit the passport in the pouch with the ziplock bag over it. I did get it inside, but after a day of snorkeling, my passport was a bit wet. The ziplock back (which was new) had gotten a small hole worn in it, and the water got in the pouch and then in the ziplock bag. Maybe the larger version of this pouch would allow you to fit a passport in a ziplock bag in it more easily, and then maybe it wouldn't wear the bag. I'm still looking for a decent waterproof pouch, but I don't think this is it."

423547,1,"This is a great, very inexpensive, extremely light weight, tried and true fire starting tool for emergencies. I have about five of them in total taking up permanent residence in my parka, hiking Backpack, emergency kits, and gun bag. This way I never forget to take one with me.Helpful hints:* The packaging says to make a pile about this size of a quarter for best results. This is very accurate however the pile should be at least 1/8 of an inch deep (eyeball it).* Be extremely careful when using a knife as a shaver/striker. I found the tool pretty effective without having to bear down on it very hard.* Use a straight, smooth, fluid motion both for shaving the magnesium off and striking the flint. DO NOT chop at the magnesium or the flint. I watched in dismay as a friend made a mess of his by chopping at it recently so I thought I would include this. The chopping motion is dangerous (when using a knife), ruins the tool, and does not yield NEARLY the same results as using a smooth motion.* If you have to use your knife, use the back side of your knife or the base of the blade if it is squared off and not sharp. Most fixed blade knifes are squared at the base. If your blade does not lock or is not fixed, USE THE BLADE. Do not try to use the back of the knife if the blade is not fixed or does not lock. It will most likely close on your fingers/hand causing injury if you try to use the back of a non-locking blade.* Don't just buy this tool and not test it out. Spend 15 minutes playing with the tool and starting a fire (in a safe and controlled environment) BEFORE you actually need it in an emergency situation. Trust me, this tool will last you a LONG time. You are not wasting it.Cons:* The product does not come with any kind of striker/shaver attached. This tool could really benefit from a small piece of metal to use as a striker and to shave magnesium off.* Shaving magnesium off and striking the flint with your knife will dull the blade pretty quickly."

464088,1,"This pump is very handy because of its small size and light weight. It also has an air hose that rotates 360 degrees, which makes it more versatile. Mounting it to the frame was easy, and it will mount to most parts of the bike frame. So far, I've been impressed with this item."
177922,1,"Prior to buying I read reviews and was made aware of some issues people had.1. The poles are telescoping making one a thinner diameter that is not very clamp-able. One user even claimed this was a one bike rack as the upper portion with a thinner diameter was unusable.2. Even on the thicker diameter pole the clamping strength may not hold over time and bicycle may inch downward.3. The surface of ceiling/floor and height of extension are considerable factors.1. I put the thicker diameter pole as the upper so both clamps could attach to it. This puts my lower bike just above the neoprene grip that keeps the clamp from going lower. The problem with the thinner diameter is no longer an issue.2. The upper clamp still slid a down a bit at my first attempt to put a bike on it. I took an old tennis ball and cut a small piece and wedged it between the clamp and the pole with the rubber side facing the pole. After a good tightening the hanger is firm and definitely not coming down. Easy fix + I didn't even buy the old tennis ball, I found it. Any piece of rubber should do the trick. This was inspired by a user posting that they used an old bike tube.3. I knew before hand that my rack would be on a carpet floor and the ceiling height was on the lower end (~8'-0&#34;)so the bike hangar did not have to be extended near capacity. So it is pretty stable. Not stable enough to climb or anything rough but it can easily handle on/off of either bike with no worries on my end.On a side note the box arrived cut in half with holes and with the pole inside holding it together but miraculously all the parts made it. Also, I had free 2 day shipping that ended up being 6 days. I understand weekends are unrealistic however, do not get me excited (UPS) by saying that my package is out for delivery at 5am on Friday only to correct on Saturday that Monday is the new delivery date. WTF, I was so excited to get my trashy looking balcony clear of my bicycles."
455623,2,"it was love at first sight with this watch. Being a diver and always in and around water, it was perfect. I had many compliments regarding it's looks, many. I would take it off each night and put it on in the morning. All went well for a little less then two years. I took it off when I went to bed and in the morning when I went to put it on it was dead. I thought battery, no problem, wasn't to keen on getting it cracked open to change it but that is what had to be done to get it running again,or so I thought. Went to my repair shop, trustworth and reliable, where I take my Submariner to. They told me it was not the battery and that it was dead. I still had to get another opinion, because I just not believe it. I did and well it was confirmed it had died and could be fixed for around $65 to $75. About what the other shop said. they both said that based on that, with it being opened up and will probably never be as good in the water, that I should look at the big picture, maybe buy a new one. That was interesting in that neither sell watches and they make their money on batteries and repairs. What would you do? For less than two years of usage, I have to decide. For now the Rolex gets to be worn. Like I said I loved it and put the Submariner away for it, that says a lot, but I do like value for the dollar too."

275784,1,"This is my third Giro helmet (after a small-vented kiddie thing and a Helios which was regretfully surrendered to a crash), and it is undeniably the best. It is extremely lightweight and comfortable, thanks in large part to the Roc Loc 4 system. This adjustable retention system provides a very snug fit and some on-the-fly adjustability. It feels so secure on the head that it sits in place even without the chin straps fastened. The straps are not overly bulky and allow for even more adjustability. The large number of vents allows the air to flow easily through the helmet, cooling longer rides. From my experience, Giro helmets are extremely safe in a crash. I have seen someone dive over his handlebars and crash headfirst into concrete while wearing one. The helmet was damaged (and subsequently retired to &quot;trophy&quot; status), but his head was intact. In addition to all of the important things, this helmet looks slick. It's hard to see on a picture how good these things really look. They are the current helmets of choice for the USPS team riders. The only downside I can see is that they are very expensive."
163403,0,"I purchased this item for what I thought was an old Marlin 336. Turns out my rifle is a model 30A, so the foregrip was tricky to get on. The buttstock bolted on perfectly, and the foregrip took a little bit of easy drilling. For the price, the product works, and works well. It was pretty much exactly what I expected. The only reason I did not give it four or five stars is because it did not exceed my expectations in any way. It's just a decent stock/grip for the decent price.Took me about 45 minutes to remove the old parts and install the new ones."

Overall it may be a decent buy, but it appears to me that it just doesn't support properly even if it wasn't bent. The material is good quality and the bag works well, but unless you have a real desire to get a hammock you can camp with I suggest a more stable, permanent hammock."
89855,2,"This is undoubtably the worst rifle ever made. Sadly many people opt for this rifle due to its small price tag. All I can say is, ""you get what you pay for."" This is a perfect example of it. You CANNOT upgrade it. It is inconsistent, has no accessories, you must pracitally destory your sight assembly to fit a scope on it. The maximum range is about 15-20 yards aiming at a mansized target. Do not be fooled by most advertisements, this rifle shoots rounghly 200 FPS. Worst of all, it WILL break within a few months and become just another expensive doorstopper. My advice, save your money and buy something better."
438186,0,"The shipping on this item was lightening fast--I ordered one afternoon and they were at my front door when I was leaving the house the next morning. The glasses are attractive and I love the polarization, but they are very uncomfortable in hot weather. There is no ventilation with these things, and you end up with sweaty eyes and fogged lenses. I haven't returned them because the price was decent and they do serve a purpose, e.g. when driving in a climate-controlled car. But there's no way I could use these as sport sunglasses."
318539,0,The Ironman arm blaster functions well. It holds my arms in place making curls a lot more effective. I felt the difference after one workout. It is inexpensive for a reason. The quality of the device is average. It has a cheap foam neck pad that slides on the strap. You also need to place the dangling end of the strap (where you adjust the length) through the neck pad to keep it out of the way. It could be a little longer and have a deeper body recess for added comfort. It doesn't bother me too much but larger people (more than 40 inch chest) would probably do better with a bigger version. Before you buy one try them out at your local sports store to see which one works/fits best.

398044,0,"I actually got these for using while riding my bike at night because I wanted clear lenses and bike glasses are a total rip-off. I've worn them during the day also and they're OK for that. At night, though, they show a lot of glare from the various lights around the city; stop lights, street lights, car lights, etc. This glare looks like extra lights so it's kind of annoying. They were cheap though so I deal with it. They do sometimes get a little bit fogged up but it clears easily if there's some air flow. I have no idea how well they work as actual safety glasses. I &#34;might&#34; recommend these to a friend."
121063,0,"I've had the RS100 with WearLink strap for about 5 months. I mainly use it on an elliptical (Precor), & when riding my bike. Here are my thoughts:The good:Seems to accurately & consistently transmit HR data. Watch has consistently detected HR soon after putting on transmitter belt each time. (I've never had to take belt off & re-wet electrodes). Visibility of heart rate (on watch) is good.The not so good:-Maintenance of WearLink strap is a pain, & time-consuming. Compared with the regular Polar straps with transmitters (i.e., T31 coded strap) and straps from Timex & others, this one requires a good bit more time to maintain & clean. If this extra cleaning is not done, as many reviewers indicate, it becomes inconsistent in transmitting HR & eventually fails. It's hard to understand why Polar hasn't provided customers with a transmitter (with strap) that's very low maintenance AND has a user-replaceable battery, as Timex & others have for years.- Poorly-thought-out display. One example: I have very good vision, but it's very difficult to see the calories expended thus far at any point during exercise session due to the tiny space in upper part of watch display dedicated for ""calories"". I find that I need extra light (or must press ""light"" key on watch) & to hold watch up relatively close to my face to see this (""calories"") information. Does Polar not realize that users would like to be able to actually see (at a glance, without much effort) the calories expended - probably several times - during exercise sessions? There's no way to enlarge this (display of calories during exercise session).- Too easy to inadvertently delete exercise data by accidentally pressing another button on watch (which then overrides exercise data).- Minor point: Watch strap & buckle poorly designed & flimsy - causes a little bit of needless frustration & extra few seconds ea. time you put on or take off."

182053,1,"Arrived the day after I ordered them and the first thing I noticed when I pulled them out of the box was the weight. These are heavy pants which I love. The material is super thick, no worries about them tearing. The pockets are large, the sizing is generous. I ordered a 36/32, knowing full well that I wear a 38/32 in most pants, but I wanted these to last after I get back to my usual weight which fits a 34-36 nicely. The elastic waist band is nice, it easily stretches to size larger and shrinks to a bit under a size smaller. The legs are a nice loose fit. I have large thighs and where a lot of pants simply don't work, these give me the room I need. I just ordered a second pair of these and wish I could afford to buy all of them and wear nothing but these everyday. I simply love them. Great fit, great quality."

In reading other online information, I had a much greater fear of the noise than what actually occurred."
62805,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed.

491171,0,This is a good little bottle. It fits in the drink holder nicely and is a good size. The cap isn't the greatest. It feels a little cheesy and doesn't always seal tight. As long as you keep it upright it's ok. I bought 2 of these and the lid is the same on both. Certainly a less expensive option than other stainless bottles on the market. I can live with the lid but YMMV
351596,0,"The unit itself is ok but what lets it down is the magnet attachment for the spokes. The magnet screws on to the spokes which should be fine , except that the thread the screw goes into is plastic. Overtighten it and you are screwed!!! as the thread is knackered. Then the magnet gets loose , turns , slides up and down , twists and the unit works intermittantly or not at all. Most annoying. In the end I had to use super glue to fix it. It is a fairly basic design fault which they could easily rectify with a metal thread insert."

504595,0,"Fit and finish were great. The only thing I didn't really like is the fabric was so thin it was almost see-through. I bought these in black and would definitely have to wear black underwear rather than white under these. Still debating as to whether I'll keep them. They are comfy in every other way, so I guess I will keep them to wear & wash and take the risk of having to discard them later. Because of the transparency, I cannot imagine how anyone could wear a color other than black with these and feel comfortable in them. The other factor in my decision to keep these is they were not made in China which were a factor for us as we do not want to support exploiting anyone via sweat shops (and avoiding Chinese factories which are notorious for horrible conditions is our clumsy attempt at trying to do what's right)."

Once you loose one of those strange pieces good luck finding replacements! No help from Skuut (do they ever answer phone/ e-mail?). Now the other reviewer with similar problems mentioned home assembly, but make no mistake: the wheels (which fell off in both our cases) are factory mounted.Now this is a safety issue as well, if you have seen kids racing around on Skuuts you know that a wheel suddenly falling off is no laughing matter.If you order a Skuut, go ahead, order some Locktite as well and put it on ALL screws, not just the ones you put in.Now to close on a good note: The Skuut is great fun for the kids as long as you can keep it rolling."
56605,0,"I received this mat and loved it at first, mostly because I just used to for only situps. But now I have moved on to doing yoga and exercises involving motions and this mat does not cut it. Through every move in yoga or motions this mat stretches out from underneath of you and you lose your pose and then get bad form from it. Another problem that I have with this mat is that if you get the smallest tear possible in it, it will continue stretching and tearing more and more. So my final though is just get it for only using it to do situps or an exercise required no motions at all."

40125,1,"I received this sword as a gift for meritorious service on a campaign; therefore it has much sentimental value for me. The sword itself is fairly well crafted and the blade even comes with an edge almost sharp enough to cut. The pommel is attractive but does contain imperfections upon close inspection. No one is going to mistake this for a museum antique or an actual sword (it is too heavy and the balance is all wrong, with the base metal of the blade putting the center of balance well forward of the pommel). Nevertheless, it is quite serviceable as a wall mounted decoration. The mounting plaque did not come with instructions and is pretty much hopeless pressboard junk. Plan on getting decorative mounting hardware from another manufacturer."

Before buying this product I researched the reviews on Amazon and have found the positive comments true as stated.

139986,2,I am very disappointed in the leg strap. I bought this game to help lose weight and if you are heavy the leg strap is difficult to get on and keep on. In fact it may not fit depending on how big you are. The company should really develop and include in the game an extension for the leg strap.
445286,2,"I've owned this umbrella for approx. six months. I have not used it in unusually bad weather. Here are three, major, problems I have had with it: (1) after using it only a few times, the arm began, spontaneously, popping open - without me pushing the open button, (2) there are two ""belts"", which have velcro, to hold the umbrella closed; the velcro on one of the ""belts"" came loose, rendering that ""belt"" useless,(3) one of the arms in the body of the umbrella lost its hinge so that when the umbrella is open, that section hangs limp. I had purchased low-cost umbrellas all my life and never had this many problems with any of them. I thought, by purchasing this higher-quality umbrella, it would last for years without issue. This hasn't been the case. I am going to return the umbrella to the seller and, reluctantly, pay the, outrageous, $10 return fee. If, for any reason, I have an issue with the seller's return process or the new umbrella, I will write another review."
506268,0,"They do lay flat, you can store stuff under them, they are short and while sitting you would sit below the top of the wind shield which is great on a cold day and makes sence why they are built the way they are built as are most similar seats. You will need some sort of foam or rubber to put around the bar that folds down onto your floor so that when laid down the aluminum does not rub on your floor which would be fine if I had carpet and not all fiberglass/topcoat. The reason I'm writing the review is because a screw came out. The one that holds the aluminum framing to the bottom of the seat, directly the support that holds the seat into the box. A few more supports/piece of wood or metal could work as well; this happened the first day out. It is a very wide and coarse screw, but the plastic seems soft bc there was plastic around the threads of the crew when we found it. That means I have to put in at least 1/4""-thread lag bolt or something to hold it until it strips out. The next choice is to plastic weld more plastic in, get some sort of anchor like with Sheetrock/cement, or get sheet aluminum or stainless steel and attach it to the bottom of the seat so that there is something sturdy to bolt things to. The framing is good, the box is sturdy and you could always build your own wooden box inside the plastic one to make it more stable. You could also just build a wooden box to lift seats up or make the box longer so that the seats recline more when in the up position. Mold has grown on the top of the material even though the material sits out in the Florida sun all day, this means that it's not mold resistant at all and will be bad in no time. The mold was a big surprise to me considering this was not a problem with the captains chairs I originally had in the boat that sat in the sun as well. I'm going to have covers made like the tailor made seat covers, but with two floatation throw cushions sewn in so that the seat sits up higher. We all drive around using two float throws now on the seat. The seat is not very comfortable in that it sits very upright. I would get a better brand and style if I could do it over again. The price is not really worth all of this."
351129,0,"I am still on the fence about this workout. The first time I did it, I hated it; Cathe's constant chatter was so annoying. The second time I did it, I pretended it was a stretching workout and didn't mind it so much. The third time I did it, I was back to being annoyed by Cathe's constant chatter.I am a long-time Cathe fan and have every one of her workouts. I always pre-order on the first day. I usually enjoy Cathe's workouts. I also practice a few types of yoga, including kundalini, vinyasa and power yoga.There were things I liked about this workout. What I liked:**The relaxing music. I usually don't like Cathe's taste in music, but I loved this music. It reminded me of the music that's played when I get a massage. It's very calming and relaxing.**The pretty set. It's still the brick walls with blank windows, but plants and flowers were added.**Cathe's meticulous attention to form. This was both a blessing and a curse (see negatives below).**It `forced' me to do stretching. I know stretching is important, particularly for someone like me who does lots of weight training and intense cardio, but I tend to skip it.**It may be good for those who prefer athletic yoga without all the talk about spirituality and new-age expressions.What I didn't like about this workout:**Cathe tried to be all things to all people and it didn't work. She gives a lot of form pointers, to the point where she is talking constantly throughout the workout. Form is critical and pointers are important for beginners. That being said, the poses are held for an extra long time, which is hard for beginners. If you can hold the pose, you're probably familiar with yoga and don't need the constant form pointers.**The misleading title and description. Yoga Max implies an advanced workout that is tough. This was more of stretch workout that was supposed to be relaxing. The end result was a stretch workout that was annoying.**The workout didn't really flow well. It seemed to me to be more of a collection of stretches that just happened to use yoga poses. I'm spoiled by Shiva Rea Vinyasa workouts where the poses flow seamlessly.If I could, I'd give this workout 3 1 /2 stars. It would have played better if Cathe called this a stretching workout. I would suggest that if you're interested in this workout, check out the clips and other reviews to see if you would enjoy it. VideoFitness Forum has some discussions about this workout as well."
334857,1,"Bought a used boat that had pedestal bases mounted in the floor. I determined by the v-notch and deep-slot that these were Springfield Taper Lock bases. I had purchased adjustable pin-style pedestals for a couple fishing seats. I ordered a couple of these adapters in hopes they would do the trick - they sure do! The v-point lines up with the base's v-notch, and you push the whole thing into the base. The arm that sticks out has a tab that snaps into the slot on the base, and once it catches, the whole thing fits perfectly flush to the base. I tried to remove it by lifting the tab, but it really grabs and holds tight - it can be removed, but it sure won't pop out accidentally! Seems to be very durable material, not a cheap composite. I hope to get many seasons out of it. Another advantage is that you can lift out the seat pedestal and insert another pin pedestal for a table, a grill, whatever you can mount on a pin pedestal."
176427,0,"1. the ""Oxford"" shorts are shown as a dark maroon kind of colour, which is what I wanted, but NO! I received them in a heather grey colour, even though the packaging still says ""Oxford"". So BEWARE! I don't know if it is a photo error or a packaging error; either way, not worth the postage to return it2. they are small but NOT THAT SMALL! I read the reviews extensively before finally buying them. Previously, someone reviewed saying that she's an S-M and a XL would fit perfectly - which is what I bought. But both pairs arrived amazingly big. I think my boyfriend can wear them! I folded the waistband (note: elastic band, not strings) down twice and the shorts are still too long and too baggy and make my butt look 50% bigger. I'm a size 4 or 6 (ie S or M), and if I were to buy again, I would get size M, or at most L. So be careful when you up the sizes!Unfortunately these were not a good buy for me. I gave it 3 stars, however, because I think if you were lucky enough to get the right size and colour, they would be pretty good and they seem very comfortable."

I also own the double high version of this matress -- and I highly recommend that version instead. It's a little bit more money, but I sleep better on that than my Cal King at home.

Note: When you cook these meals be sure to mix everything up really good so you don't get a bite of dried food. Also, let it cook for as long as possible!

A friend suggested the Topeak Road Morph G Bike Pump with Gauge for the quality, air capacity, gauge and fold-down foot rest. I really like the flexible hose (the Zefal had a valve at the end of the cylinder) and the pump works well. I had a little difficulty with changing the valves but another reviewer here clearly spelled out how to do it. The zip tie mounting is a little cheesy, but I'm not going to ding them for it.

147754,1,"My son has a few bikes already, but since I got it for him about a month ago, this is his first choice to ride. It seems well-made and it only took about a half hour to put together. It wasn't too hard and the directions were pretty clear. Normally, I would rather get the bike already put together, but one of the reviews said it wasn't too bad, and I'm glad I didn't let that deter me.It isn't great for riding on any hilly areas. The tires are plastic and it's hard to pedal it going uphill without the pedals moving without engaging the wheels. But any park with a reasonably level surface is great and it doesn't take up too much room in the car. We let our son ride in the house and in the backyard patio area and I haven't noticed any damage to our laminate wood floors. (Hard to say since our floors have been through a lot with him, though.)He loves to pretend he is riding a motorcycle and this bike makes pretty cool sounds. I'm totally immune to noise at this point, so it doesn't bother me, but there is an on-off switch for the sounds (and you can always take the batteries out.)I'm really glad I got this bike even though we have two other tricycles and one 2 wheeler with training wheels. His friends love to come over and ride together, so it's worth it to get an extra bike or two. And the price was so reasonable, I didn't have to get it used. I would definitely recommend this bike."

One of our weight group purchased the pedometer from Amazon and recommedned it to me.Since purchasing my pedometer, my walking, (and jogging in place in front of the TV each night), has increased by leaps and bounds!! The calorie and mileage counters have greatly added to my committment to walk. I have lost 1 or 3 pounds each week since my purchase, and I attribute this success to my pedomter!

453727,1,"I bought this when my family was getting together for a Disney vacation. I wanted to ensure we didn't have chafing thighs or sore feet after walking around the Disney parks for hours in the Florida heat. It worked great--none of us had blisters or chafing issues.My boyfriend is a runner and also likes it for marathon training.The great thing about the tube was I could squeeze some out into individual containers for each family member. The consistency, which I expected would be similar to Vaseline, was thicker than I expected so a little goes a long way. I think the tube version is probably more sanitary than a stick since you're dispensing it into your hands to apply it. The tube also allows you to, say, apply it between toes. It washes off well with soap and water.The packaging says it was created by a physician and is wetsuit-safe (if that's a concern) and contains anti-fungal and anti-bacterial agents.Personally I would be happier about using it long-term if it was free of parabens, which I don't think it is (hence the four-star rating). But I'm not aware of any alternatives that are paraben-free either, so at the moment this is probably the best bet for runners or anyone battling chafing."

61980,0,"I'm an active athletic college grad student, always on the go. I spend a lot of time on college campuses and in the great outdoors/gym.I've only had the bottle for a couple months. Within ~25 or so uses I noticed a leak in the part of the cap that flips open. If I turn it upside down at all, I risk dripping significant amounts of water, all over myself or my things in my bag. When the valve is flipped up, even more water drips through. The bottle is NOT leak-proof in my experience.I called the company and explained the situation. The woman started lecturing about the correct way to clean and ""maintain"" it (really? telling me it's somehow my fault?). She then offered to replace it and mail me a new one.I requested that instead of a new bite valve cap they should send me just a plain old screw on cap, because I have no faith in a water bottle design that isn't water proof. They agreed, and a few weeks later I'm still waiting for it to arrive.I would highly recommend against the bite valve design. I do not want to live in a world where something as simple as a water bottle requires ""maintenance."" That said, the bottle itself is perfectly fine, hard to mess up, so just avoid the bite valve gimmick and you should be fine.UPDATE: The mail came in. They sent me 2 new caps: one with the bite valve and one regular. I threw away the 2 bite valve caps and use the regular cap. The company delivered, and has very good with customer care."

When I first received this four pack I thought that it was missing one of the parts. In the assembly instructions there's an e-mail and phone toll free phone number provided for product support. The phone number is for some sporting goods/fitness type of company ( I called after hours and got there answering machine) and their e-mail address is not a valid address (i.e., it bounced back as undeliverable) so, should you ever need any support or parts for these tables you are out of luck. I considered sending it back to Amazon but I'm actually happy with the product as it does meet our needs but once thirty days of ownership goes by your on your own.So, if you take a chance and buy this, make sure you check that all the parts are there BEFORE you assemble it. Otherwise it will be a real pain in the butt to disassemble it and try to repackage it for return shipping.Buy at your own risk. I assure you there will be no manufacturer's support for this product should you need it.I'm a little disappointed that Amazon would sell such a product."

496485,0,"I recently took up bike riding, both for fun and for exercise. I didn't spend too much on my bike, because I wasn't sure how involved I would stay with it, but I did want a comfortable seat so purchasing a replacement one was a must!I did quite a bit of looking around on Amazon and other sites. Price wasn't as important as comfort, so reviews were helpful and especially from Women. I settled on theSchwinn Pillow Top Cruiser Bicycle Seatbecause it seemed to have some of the features I thought were important such as a wider seat and a cushioned or gel top.It was very easy to install with standard household tools and with just a bit of adjusting I was ready to ride. The first week I rode was great except that no matter how I positioned myself the seat never felt entirely comfortable. I even readjusted it the second week hoping that it would help, but it didn't. I still have this seat on and continue to ride, but I my search continues for a new one.I still think this is a nice seat and it obviously works for many people, but I guess I must be one of those that it just isn't a good fit for."

282119,2,"Let me first say that this mat is very soft and provides excellent cushioning for the back and the knees. But that's about the only positive thing I can point out about it. I'm rotating a number of Jillian Michaels' workout DVDs. Needless to say I end up sweating A LOT. During floor exercises the sweat collects on the mat and it becomes so slippery that my hands are sliding away from under me when I am doing any plank moves. Clinging to the sides doesn't help either because the mat is so stretchy it gives way, and that also damages it. I wear shoes during my workout because I'm afraid I might hurt my ankles or toes with all the jumping and lunging, and that also shows on the mat in form of scratches. During pylometric exercises the mat moves around and bunches up (on a carpeted floor). The thickness and softness of it becomes a disadvantage for me when I try to balance myself on one leg. Also, I find the mat to be too short for much of the dynamic floor work (I'm 5'8"")."

I love the options the sheath gives you. It fits on my 5.11 RUSH bags perfectly. The blade is nice and thick, the knife feels balanced, stout. The strike cap feels like it will do what its made for, smashing sh*t. The straight edge is not as sharp as I thought it would be, but it looks like an edge that will last in the field, plus the serrations are more than sharp enough if you need to cut through something fast!

233628,0,"Im not a gunsmith or a gun nut, but I am a factory trained armorer for SW revolvers. Otherwise, I would have taken the sights to a gunsmith and been 5 star happy. Because revolvers are niche weapons in law enforcement nowadays, I dont get nearly as much practice on them as I do the plastic electric guns. Because I dont get as much practice, when work doesn't go smoothly on revolvers, my first reaction (usually correctly) is to doubt myself. I spent a couple of hours trying in vain to get the tiny detent/plunger and the detent spring properly installed, no doubt stressing six months of my lifespan away in the process. Finally, I went into our part supply and pulled a rear sight stock screw and found out the plunger hole in the Meprolight screw is the wrong size. Tried to replace MPL screw with factory screw and couldn't- they are threaded differently. So choices are to install without detent or have gunsmith rebore the MPL screw hole.I looked online and I am not the only person who has encountered MPL screws with improper holes. If someone else brings me these, the first thing I will do is grab a spare detent and try the hole size. If its not a match, I will immediately send them away to a gunsmith.I'm sure I will see them again. The sights looked and worked great once they were on."

In that time it had fairly regular use and sustained a fair number of small dents, which seems to be fairly common with this type of bottle.However- I was VERY much taken aback the last time I filled it and it had developed a pin size hole on the side of it- not where any dent was near. This causes a water to run down the side of the bottle and renders it useless.I think 5 months is much too short a life for a stainless steel bottle. I wish I had invested the money in something that would last. I contacted the company and was told that returns were handled by the seller, no guarantee by them."

When I go over big bumps, the light falls forward.Other Planet Bike stuff is excellent, but this leaves a bit to be desired.Edit: Tried new alkalines versus charged ni-mh batteries.

275306,0,"This bike rack works well once it is mounted. The description of the item did not mention that it needed to be mounted on the Thule roof rack adapter. I ordered only the bike rack. I hoped that the rack would mount directly to my Toyota Rav4's factory roof rack. I've since been looking at other factory roof racks, and have noticed that most of them have airplane wing-like bars which go from side to side. These bars are about three inches in width, and the hardware on the Big Mouth Bike Rack is set up to fit the Thule adapter, which has bars little more than an inch in width. Instead of ordering the adapter, I spent a day tooling my own mounting hardware. This gives the bike rack a much cleaner look, and sets the rack and bike closer to the roof, making it easier to load and unload. The second problem is that the end caps come off much too easily. Other than these problems, the rack works well, and is easy to load and unload."

My husband was without his watch for 6-8 weeks, but it was returned in working order.Now, (Jan. 2012) it's not keeping time again. I'm hoping it's just the battery this time, but I have a Seiko which I've had for 10 years and it's never had a problem. Do Tag Heuer watches bought elsewhere have this many issues?? I can't believe that's the case, which makes me concerned that those bought on Amazon are 'refurbished' or 'seconds'."

140585,0,"I had high hopes for this game since it was produced by EA but sadly after 3 days of game play, I'm not that impressed. The exercises and stretches are ok but the motion control isn't that good. I still can't seem to get the squats to work. While the exercises are ok, the ""sports"" games are really not that fun. They're actually kind of boring and repetitive. Once again, the motion control isn't that good on the sports games like volleyball. In addition, you try to hit these targets on a lot of sports games and no matter how bad your form is, you always seems to hit the targets.One big problem that other people have mentioned is that the leg strap keeps falling down. My gf is skinny and even with the adjustment strip, it still falls down.Overall, if you are new to exercising and need some motivation to do some easy exercises, the game is worth a try but if you have already had experience in exercising, then this game is actually a bit frustrating."

473134,1,"Purchased this a while ago (purple one, high resistance)Shipping: Came on time, packaged fine - no problems there.Contents: Came with band, door attachment in a box with a little manual on a couple of exercises. Nothing wrong with any of these things, fine condition.Product: Well-satisfied. I don't believe anyone that says they snapped this thing. It's incredibly durable and has weathered even my intentional attempts to snap it. Door attachment looks cheap and dangerous, but it works just fine. As a tip you should put it on the back part of your door, by the hinges, instead of the opening side. Much safer and sturdy this way.It's very strong, very durable lasted me a few years already.Note that resistance bands are not intended to be exactly like weights. Therefore you should not really be struggling to bring one of these up the way you bring a weight up. This is probably the source of complaints that the resistance is too small.Probably biggest downside is that it has a kind of dirty rubber smell that will get on your hands after use. The handles also get moved around and its kind of annoying to readjust it for different workouts.Price: Seen the same thing at Big 5 and other sporting goods stores for 12-13 bucks. I'd say the 10 bucks here is worth it. Save some gas and a trip to the store too."

2119,0,"I don't love this bike rack. I bought it for my hatchback, and it's nice that the angle can adjust to fit my car. It also doesn't scratch the car at all with the rubber pads and coated strap hooks, which are both nice features. But the arms don't lock into place very well. You just have to tighten these little knobs down the best you can. I wish they would click or snap into place. Then they wouldn't wiggle lose and always require tightening. The cinch straps are also awkward to tighten down, and don't work great on bikes with cables running along the top, or really skinny frames. There's a plastic molded piece for both bikes that's supposed to let you strap in your front tube too, but it's in the wrong place, especially for the shape of my carbon frame road bike, so it ends up just being in the way and can scratch the frame. Over all it's a sturdy rack (very heavy!) but poorly designed."
73684,2,"First, the shipping and packaging. Very poor for both. Shipping was far too long. I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered. The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay, however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag. All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away. They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse... in the trunk of somebody's car. I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second, I ordered XL and glad I did. I normally wear a large, but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them, they shrunk to just about a Large size. I'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering. If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light. This is fine with me. Others may not like a light sweatshirt. It won't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all, I got what I paid for. A cheap sweatshirt."

The straps that you loop around your mat are adjustable, but are SUPER long. I have a 3/16"" jade mat and there is a lot of leftover tail. It would easily fit a much thicker mat, probably even my pilates mat. Ironically, the shoulder strap seems short. The other thing I don't like is the straps get twisted very easy. It seems to take quite a while to get it set up properly to buckle it so the straps aren't twisted and are centered on the mat. I'm going to go back to some sort of yoga bag/tote. Much quicker to get out of the studio when finished."

283777,0,"This item is an inferior, cheaper version of Ontario's Black Wind swords. That being said, this isn't a bad item. Its makers certainly knew they were using inferior materials, and made the best thing they could anyway. The steel, while not very good, is thick and well designed for maximum durability. The scabbard is pretty useless for wear on the back, it's only good for its belt loop. It's also right handed only, which I find very stupid. It took a whole star off its rating. I threw the scabbard away entirely. Even if you're right handed, it's nothing special, and mine cracked at the edges the first time I drew the blade. Good sword for the price, very bad scabbard. If that's okay, get one."

Held fine to the beach with 1 stop halfway to re-tighten the straps. On the way back, my husband was lazy about stopping and the rack almost came off when we were a mile from our home - so please, stop every 100 miles to tighten the straps if you are driving long distances.I had a big grievance soon after I bought this because it is sold way cheaper at Toys R Us."

436230,0,"Short and SweetI have had these for over a year now and wear them at least once a week. There is a design flaw in the pocket which I hope will be fixed soon. When I sit on anything that places my knees higher than my rear things begin to fall out of the pockets. This includes car seats, couches, and recliners. Other than that, love them.ExpandedI purchased these one year ago along with a similar pair of Columbia Silver Ridge II convertible pants which I will be using for comparison. I find myself wearing the Mesa pants much more because of a few key features which I will point out in a moment. First let me lay down my general impressions. They are very comfortable. They have a waist lining which by the manufacturers description is chamois lined and it is very nice indeed. The fabric has held up just fine to regular one to two time a week wear. I have also taken these on several weeks of travel and backpacking. They are light weight (a little heavier than the Columbia), quick drying, and durable enough not to worry about if they are going to snag on a branch. Finally, I just plain like how they look on me.What I LikeThe Mesa pants feature that I like the most is in the waist band. Not the chamois portion, though nice, more specifically it is the belt. The nylon belt is integrated into the pants much like a drawstring, completely enclosed by fabric. On the Silver Ridge the nylon belt goes through loops which sometimes ride up and begin to chafe my sides. Also, the belt being enclosed means that when I wash it, it stays in place unlike the Ridge II pants which comes out, ties itself into knots and then requires rethreading of the belt after each wash (trust me it gets annoying). The best part of the Mesa belt is that it actually works. I find that with the Ridge II pants the belt requires repeated tightening throughout the day. I have finally started tying a knot in the belt so that I would not need to do this. With the Mesa pants I have never needed to do this. Even when I go to the range and have a pistol on my hip for hours at a time I rarely need to adjust the belt on the Mesa pants.What I Don't LikeWhat I hate, and yes there is something that I hate about these pants, is that they are some of the worst pants that I have ever owned for keeping things in the pockets. Now I did buy these on a discount clothing site, perhaps they have updated the design but I nearly stopped wearing these pants because of the pockets. If you have anything that will not grab the netting which the pockets are made of (keys stay put thank goodness) such as lighters, pens, small flashlights, you had better do a quick check of your pockets after getting up from a couch, car, and every time from a recliner. Basically, if your knees go above your rear, your pockets are going to start vomiting out your goodies.RatingI give these pants a three star rating because of the poorly designed pockets. All the other features about the Mesa pants are great, so much so that I still where them more than anything else but the pockets suck. For what it is worth, if the pockets were redesigned I would rate these a high four.Bottom lineI would buy these again because I just plane like them and they work for me. Great belt, bad pockets, fix this MH!"
402717,1,"I've bought 3 of these things now. The first one I bought was stolen along with my truck! Thankfully, the police recovered the truck but the knife was gone. I liked it so much I ordered another one. Just finished ordering a 3rd for my son as a gift.Sturdy knife, solid construction, all stainless. Comes with a decent black nylon case. Holds an edge fairly well. I take it hunting and have skinned deers with it.You should know they make another version of this knife with a gut hook on the back of the blade that might be handy if you wanted to use it to field dress game. Personally, I prefer to go without the gut hook in favor of the stronger blade, but that's up to you.Anyway, it's a good rugged outdoor knife, can't go wrong with this one."

Rinsing them out or washing by hand creates a bit of a mess as the items inside for weight leak brown color when wet.I'm a man and when I put these at the tightest with the straps, they do not stay on my wrists, I have to push them up my arms a bit. Obviously made for those who are more obese.However, they are very very comfortable (soft) and have held up well with many long distance runs."

332262,0,This model will challenge your patientce. The parts all have excessive flash to be cleaned off and they dont even come close to fitting without gaps. A lot of sanding and filling will be required for the seams on tail and undercarriage. The fit of the top and windshield is non-existant and must be made. Then when you think you have got it easy and downhill they decals will make you crenge no wet and stick to these it wet and fall off better have a handy supply of decal set and fix. This is almost close to a scratch build when it comes to fitting. If it doesnt drive you crazy it will make you a better builder.
322309,0,"Was excited when this arrived with the expectation that it would be easy to switch out the original wood parts of my 1974 Marlin .60 with this new composite stock. Was very disappointed with the amount of drilling out I had to do with my Dremel to get everything to work.Not sure how different new Marlin .60's from my version, but I had to significantly drill out the interior of the handle in order for the trigger assembly to fit. Not a big deal if your relatively handy, but this product is advertised to be an effortless change out.Everything fits now and the only other gripe I have is the so-so fit of the upper barrel piece that snaps over the barrel. I think that could be refined for a better fit, but overall I do like the &#34;tactical&#34; look of the gun."

I opened it up to check the case/chips for damage and was very happy with the look of it all. The chips are cellophane-wrapped and to my un-trained poker eye they look very professional.It's very heavy - but he's an older teen - he'll be fine.I thought the price was decent, got free shipping and hoping my son is just as pleased when he opens it in a few weeks.I'm giving a 4-star review - this being a gift, I can't fully unwrap the chips and tote around the case myself to fully comment on the total quality."

284135,2,"I bought this to take my family of five and two dogs camping in Virginia over Memorial Day. I figured we would need the room and the dividers would help keep the kids and gear seperate. When we arrived at camp, it was in the afternoon and we started setting up camp. Setting up the tent turned out to be a major frustration. Complicated poles and set up instructions. Worse, one of the cheap plastic roof clips that hold the roof up on the pole busted. It just snapped in two when we tried to snap the pole in place. As a result we had a big sag in our roof all week. Next the main door zipper got stuck, and we ended up having to use safety pins to keep the mesh door closed at night. This created a minor problem with bugs. My kids hate bugs and I heard about every bug in the tent, all night, every night. We ended up 'bombing' the tent with Raid bug spray, which helped but left a nice chemical pine scent in the tent. OK, so we're campers and we perservered. Until the 2nd to the last night, when it rained, as it often does in Virginia, and guess what....we all got soaked. Dogs, gear, sleeping bags, kids, wife, shoes. We had numerous leaks around the roof material seams and on one of the windows. OK so maybe soaked is a bit of an exageration, but its close. What wasn't wet was damp.I tried to return the tent but the dealer where I bought it only wanted to make repairs. So I called Eureka and got basically the same response, if I would return it at my expense they would 'evaluate' the tent and get back to me.Bottom line - very disappoointed. This is a fair weather tent at best, based on my experience. I sure wouldn't trust it if I even suspected that it could rain."

490364,1,"I have been using the SOG Flash II for a month. I found out about the Flash II through the reviews on Amazon.com, starting with reviews of the Kershaw Skyline that referred to the SOG Flash I and then the reviews of the Flash I that made comparisons with the Flash II. Some reviews said that the Flash I was a little small, had a finger groove that did not quite fit, and a rattling lock, so, since the Flash II was less than $50 ($42.24 with free Super Saver shipping when I ordered it), had a bigger handle, had a new Arc Actuator lock, was only about 3.1 ounces in weight, and had a handle design that left enough space between the handle and the thumbstuds (similar to my Kershaw Storm II) that I thought I could actually use the thumbstuds to successfully open the blade (I usually have an easier time opening the blade with the flipper style opening designs), I decided to try the Flash II. I like the comfort of the handle, the weight of the knife, the sharpness and shape of the blade, and the ease of opening. With some knives, I have to grip the knife handle tightly and position my thumb carefully and push quite a bit to start getting the blade open. Not so with the Flash II. As one reviewer said on 10/8/2009, it ""opens fast and hard feels like it could fly right out of your hand when opening it."" When I held it loosely and pushed on the thumbstuds, my Flash II DID fly out of my hand -- fortunately, I was sitting down at the time (so the knife did not fall very far) and the knife landed flat on its side and did not hit my feet (and no one was watching me at the time).In recent years, I have downsized my lockblade knives for everyday carry from the Buck Folding Hunter-Spyderco Endura-Kershaw Storm II size to 3-inch lockblade folders that are about 2.3 to 2.6 ounces in weight, so I did not buy the Flash II for everyday carry around the office. However, even though it is bigger than what I need around the office, I have been carrying it around the office and opening and closing it just to ""practice"" with it and become familiar with the different feel of the Flash II. I agree with the reviewer on 2/9/2009 who called it ""a fun knife."" It actually is light enough for everyday carry. I also carry a Victorinox Swiss Army Knife (usually, a Victorinox Executive to the office), so if I have to cut something in front of mixed and uncertain company in the office, I can pull out a little red-handled Swiss Army Knife instead of the Flash II.The only problem I have had is with the low-carry bayonet pocket clip. I certainly wanted to try it, because most of the reviews that mentioned the low-carry clip reported very favorably about the low-carry clip design. One reviewer did say on 4/14/2009 that it was ""hard to get off."" Interestingly, the only SOG knife that I already owned was the SOG AutoClip -- the old version with a slot in the 3.5-inch lockblade but no thumbstuds -- that I bought because I liked the idea of having a pocket clip that could have its tension adjusted for pocket material of different thickness, but the metal clip of the Flash II is not adjustable. I am used to knives having a part sticking up above the pocket clip that can be grasped to pull the knife out of the pocket. With the low-carry pocket clip on my Flash II, I was grasping the knife with my thumb on the side of the handle inside my pocket and with my index finger ON the clip outside my pocket. Squeezing the thumb and the index finger resulted in additional pressure being placed on the clip against the pocket material and the knife handle -- the pocket material bunched up and withdrawal of the knife got hung up. Not a smooth draw from the pocket. I figured that I must be doing it wrong, so I sent a message to SOG asking what was the proper technique to use to pull the knife with the low-carry pocket clip smoothly out of the pocket. The SOG Warranty Administrator kindly replied as follows, ""I grab the bottom of the clip with my forefinger and my thumb resting on the top of the knife that is sticking out, and when I pull up on it, I am slightly bending the clip out and pulling up at the same time."" I tried that and found that lifting the clip (which is really stiff) minimized the bunching up of the pocket material and did make it easier to pull the knife out of the pocket. However, the edge of the clip dug into my index finger when my index finger alone was lifting the knife out of the pocket by the edge of the clip and it did not take long before my finger was sore -- wincing in pain is not what I wanted every time that I pulled my Flash II out of my pocket (I noticed that the low-carry clip on the SOG Aegis is designed differently, with the tip of the clip bent up and away from the knife handle, which would seem to be a better design for the technique of lifting the end of the clip without having the tip dig into the finger, so I might try the Aegis if one of its versions drops in price to below $50 -- Nutnfancy in his YouTube video review of an Aegis commented that he thought that the Flash II was ""kinda goofy looking"" but that the Aegis was a ""beautiful knife"" and ""freaking awesome""). Furthermore, placing my thumb at the top of the knife did not provide much of a grip once the pocket clip cleared the pocket, and the knife slipped (fortunately, when it did slip, it fell INTO my pocket and not on the floor). So now when I grab my Flash II, I place my thumb on the top or back of the handle, my index finger at the end of the clip to lift it a little, and my middle finger on the bottom of the handle (the side where the blade is) and pull primarily with my thumb and middle finger pinching the top and bottom of the knife handle at its back end. There is less pressure on my index finger, so it hurts less, and the knife has not slipped out of my hand when I have used this three-finger (or thumb and two-finger, if you don't consider the thumb to be a finger) grip.But in view of the difficulty I have had in pulling my Flash II out of my pocket when the pocket clip is engaged, I am not quite convinced about the value of the low-carry pocket clip design (at least the design of the clip on the Flash II, now that I noticed the difference in the design of the clip on the Aegis, which I have not tried, yet) -- if I was so concerned about someone noticing that I might have a knife clipped to my pocket, I would just put the entire knife inside my pocket.UPDATE June 24, 2010: I received the SOG Aegis and have been carrying it. I prefer the clip on the Aegis. The Aegis' clip is bent upwards at the end and the clip seems to be more flexible (possibly because the point of contact with the handle for this clip is at the end, whereas the Flash II's clip has the point of contact closer to the middle of the clip), making it easier to withdraw the Aegis knife from various pants pockets that have material of varying thickness.UPDATE July 10, 2010: I noticed a crack at the tip of the handle on my original SOG Aegis, so it was returned for a replacement. The clip on the replacement Aegis does not seem to be as flexible as I thought it was when I first received the Aegis. In addition, the Aegis has friction strips on the handle with raised letters ""SOGSOGSOGSOG"" that add more resistance against sliding the knife out of the pocket easily. Furthermore, the end of the handle is not as flared out as the handle on the Flash II, so it is difficult to use the three-fingered grip on the Aegis -- I have difficulty getting a grip that way. So now I just reach into my pocket, grab the knife, and yank it out of the pocket and do not bother trying to use the tip of the clip of either the Flash II or the Aegis. Time will tell what happens to my pockets. So whatever advantage the design of the clip on the Aegis might have had over the design of the clip on the Flash II appears to have been countered by other changes in the handle of the Aegis."

When we came back outside, the Quik Shade had collapsed. 4 snapped scissor supports, 1 snapped leg, a ripped canopy top, and 4 cracked scissor connectors.I emailed customer support and attached photos of the ""disaster"" and they said the Quik Shade was designed for shade only and not for storms so the warranty would not cover it. They still agreed to send me the replacement parts to repair it as a one time courtesy.Final review: Great for the shade, not built for weather. Take it down when a wind or rain storm starts."

The engine sounds are not very loud and there is no way to modify the sounds. He hung it in his office and if he has the radio on, you can't even hear the clock when it strikes on the hour. I do like the fact that the clock has a sensor for darkness. If it is dark in the room, the sounds do not go off. That's a good feature. All in all, the clock was a nice purchase and my husband likes it, but the manufacturer could put a volume control on the sounds."

Bottom line, it works just like any of my other towels, although the Gaiam sucks, but that's besides the point. Compared to the YogaRat towel it's no better. However, it is WORSE than any of my other towels in the sense that it SMELLS funky all the time. It has held a stench like crazy since the first time I used it, even after multiple washings. None of my other yoga towels or clothes have this problem. The second I start to sweat on it I can instantly smell the sick sweat/patchouli like scent that makes me super self conscious during the entire class.

It turns out that I also could not find any Canon binoculars with a digital camera; oh well, may they will make one in the future. When Canon makes one I will be ready to purchase."
489541,1,It is currently in use and I've no complaints. It is what it is and that's a low cost but effective case to carry and store handguns. Nothing fancy but then again I didn't pay for anything fancy.

I have gained about 40 pounds(mind you I am due in like 3 days now). The only two issues, the top section for a size 40 is huge, I feel like I have a ton of denim over my chest, and the stitching in the crotch. If the bibs are not adjusted correctly at the shoulder straps, can rub a little when ya walk, if you know what I mean....."
162601,1,"The monitor was bought because the battery on my old transmitter had run down. I was pleasently surprised to see that the new transmitter had a replacable battery. The receiver is not used much, but just gives current and average HR."
388666,2,As another reviewer stated the inside was damp even with a bag of dessicant inside. So I question the waterproof feature of the item. Plus why was it damp inside anyway???Letting it dry out and getting some new dessicant to include with anything I place inside.

290649,1,"The Rio is not the best whitewater kayak, nor is it the best touring kayak , but for the price, it's the perfect multi-purpose boat. I use mine to paddle rivers, lakes and the ocean. It has enough agility to manuver around rocks and through rapids, and if you paddle evenly, it will track reasonably well on flat water. The thick cover protecting the tubes is so much better than the Tahiti-type boats, that I never wory about springing a leak. The seat is very comfortable and elevated a few inches off of the bottom of the boat to help keep your backside dry. It's not a true self-bailer, but there is a plug in the rear that can be removed to allow water to drain if you're in big waves or whitewater. Overall, I'm very pleased with my little Sevylor Rio. For a kayak, it is extremely stable, even when fishing; it's easy and comfortable to paddle, and it is very well-built. I totally recommend this boat. In fact, I'm looking to buy one for my wife now too."
392076,0,"Simple, either user error or the monitor did not work on this particular unit. Either way did not work for me. Out of 10 attempts to get a reading on my heart rate, I was only successful two (2) times. I do not have the patients or time to try and find the ""sweet spot"". If you do, this might be the Heart Rate Monitor for you. However, it worked and looked great as a time piece! Currently pending a refund on this model."
33797,0,"I sit A LOT at my job and decided that I would get this treadmill so that I could move more during the day during my breaks. I have a herniated disk and sitting all day just makes it worse.First, The treadmill came to me at record pace. I ordered it Friday and it arrived that Monday with standard shipping! Very easy to put together. I had the assistance of my 12 year old daughter and we were able to finish it in 15 minutes. However, this is where my 3 star rating comes in...when you put it together you only have one option for the incline and it's pretty steep. I've tightened the belt as much as it will go and it is still very difficult to walk normal on. Now, granted I am completely out of shape and have back issues so a flatter level option would have been better for me. Someone w/o back issues may not have as difficult a time as I do. That said, I will give it a try and maybe it will become easier for me."

476362,0,"If you are looking for a body-fit, dri-power tee, this product isn't it. I usually wear medium to large t-shirts and prefer to workout in body fit or non baggy clothes. I've already read reviews about how big they were and to order a size smaller. Mediums are usually a tight fit for me. I'm 5'8"", weigh 180 lbs., muscular built. When I ordered three different medium colors. Wow.. when I received them, the mediums were pretty loose on me. I could easily grab an inch on side of my torso before stretching the product.The shirts are made of good material, comparable to Underarmour and other products. It just doesn't look as great as them. Wearing the Russell brand made me feel like I'm working out with a king size pillow sheet."

359138,0,"the optic quality is good and it seat great on the face. Also the lanes work very good in the sun and and dusk and dawn (we have a very strong sun here where I live). Also ventilation while riding is very good. Also you have many nice accessories such as the strap and the sweat bar. All these are the positive things, but there are few serious issues with these -1. The temples have axis to them that allow the temples to rotate, the thing is after some time is start rotating all the time2. the temples are very fragile - I broke one when I placed it inside my backpack and when I took it out it broke very easily - too easy3. Customer support (at least in the US) is terrible for them. I try to contact them about the issues I have and never got any replybottom line - you can find better than this"
271669,0,Nice product. However the S&H costs were high and it took forever to receive shipment.
343460,0,"I was a little skeptic on this seat, not because of safety reasons (it comes with more than enough designed measures to keep the seat tightly attached to the bike), not because of size either -although my seat rests about 10 inches from my childs face when riding-. I was concerned about comfort and that my child (she's 2 years old) could ride comfortably during long rides. I've been riding with my child in her seat for about two weeks, in about 2km/5km rides every time. She even rides singing and admiring the scenery. Yesterday she even took a nap when riding... and we arrived home with her snoring!!! So... yes, it's a confortable seat.If I could ask for something, it would be more face-room for her, but I guess my bike is not long enough. Leg room could also be improved, since my feet get too close to her toes, and sometimes both of my heels brush her toes when pedaling. I keep feeling my bike is short in dimensions."
5855,0,"I bought my 4000 about 4 years ago - since then they may have updated the firmware but it had one nasty bug. If you wanted a continuous plot over time (days lets say) you had to leave the 4000 turned on continuously to gather data. That meant batteries - LOTS of batteries, even though it ran for 3 days on 2 ea AAA cells. It also meant alot of use of the battery door, which has a firm gasket to weatherproof the unit.In short, the battery door proved to be a weakness - I had an OD and a bright orange unit - both failed on the battery door. Due to the glued up housing design the broken part made the units unrepairable.Today the 4500 model is available for $35 more and includes many more features, like a compass, and the ability to have the unit power up, take readings, and power down every 30 minutes. So far after 10 days, mine has only used 3% of the batteries taking measurements every 30 minutes for detailed plots of pressure, altimeter, wind speed, and a half dozen other variables.The 4500 represents the state of the art system which is why I purchased it after destroying two 4000's. You can find the 4500 here:Kestrel 4500 Pocket Weather Tracker. They also make an OD green version, however the backlight is optimized for night vision goggles which means ordinary eyesight won't see much at all. Unless you are using it with a $4K set of an/pvs-xx goggles then you should buy the yellow cased version which has ample brightness for night use."
107016,1,I got these pants primarily for golf. They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free. Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn.
452105,0,"Overall Im happy with the shorts... I mean, it's really a piece of fabric to cover part of your legs.I have to say thou, one must double clarify the size thing on these. I read the reviews on this product before making the purchase and ordered an L size and frankly they are too small, I'm a 4 and these shorts squeeze my love handles so, that I cant really wear them with a tight shirt without looking like a fatty.Other than that they'r fine.I would recommend them however make sure you get the size you need."
154114,0,"This rifle looks pretty good and that is what you should buy it for. The ""laser"" site is good for playing with cats. Think of it as a cheap toy gun that happens to spit out plastic BB's and you will not be disappointed. Hobbytron is a good relible vender."

162348,2,"I purchased this rug in sunshine, and I was very excited when it arrived because of the fabulous colored design. Unfortunately, once I opened the packaging, I was met with a musty smell. The rug honestly smelt like dirty dish towels. I tried to overcome the smell my airing the rug out on a clothes line for a few days. No airing time nor fabric spray could eliminate the odor. I went to one class on the rug, the smell was too strong I couldn't concentrate. Also, the rug came with many cotton threads starting to unravel within the pattern. The rug left marks on my knees and hands from poses, overall I was not impressed."
86703,1,I bought this on the recommendation of someone else. I was looking for a good all around lock-blade knife. What a great purchase. The knife is surprisingly light and strong--must be those new-fangled materials. I love the tanto blade. I've had knives with that blade in the past. You can punch through a steel drum with that type of blade--not recommended.

Worked well.2nd - for overnight guests (air mattress was two weeks old). Worked well, felt good.3rd - for weekend guests (air mattress was two months old). DISASTER. The mattress was half-deflated by 2AM. The same thing happened to our poor guests for all three nights they were here. I'm sure they've never been happier to return to their own bed.We were incredibly careful about storing the product while not in use and there is no discernible leak (no noise) so we can't fix the problem/patch a hole. Needless to say, I am horribly disappointed. Guess it's back to the pull-out couch for our friends and family. Don't waste your money on this product if you plan on getting more than one decent use out of it."
225654,0,Nice quality sweatshirt. Unfortunately the website shows the color that I bought to more of a lime green. When it arrived it is more of a glow in the dark green. In face I think it would glow in the dark.Took longer to get to me then promised.
276348,2,My son ordered this product so that he and his friends could jump before slam dunking his baskestball into the hoop.

I think the quality is very low but for $30 I guess you get what you pay for....

211834,0,"I bought this with the idea of using it for frying an egg or two, since eggs stick to my stainless pans. If you have the same idea, don't buy this! Buy a teflon coated one instead. My old teflon pan was ideal for frying eggs; they slide right off. Since eggs stick, you will have to use a spatula to get the eggs out. But this skillet is too small and the sides too high to allow easy flipping with a spatula. And then the cleaning...this pan does not have a mirror surface, rather a porous one. Eggs get stuck in the pores and don't clean off easily."

Disappointing for what they used to be. If you don't mind a thinner cotton shirt, this one is good."

39399,0,"The pack is very comfortable, and has ample room for some extra gear. The 100 ounce reservoir is a good size too for my long recreational rides.My only gripe about the pack, is the lack of something stiff/hard in between the reservoir and the 'Air Director' back panel. When you fill the reservoir to full capacity, it is elliptical in shape and tends to push the center of the back panel out towards your back. And this cuts down on the efficiency/effectiveness of the 'Air Director' back panel. I took an old 3 ring binder that I had laying around, and cut the front cover off and shoved it in there, and that helped a lot."

Unfortunately we found it's a bit wobbly due to the bracket which enables it to fold. The wobble makes leaps, switch leaps, back walkovers, etc. difficult. I think this is an awesome beam for a little one just starting gymnastics but not for those who want to practice/refine skills for competition."

86512,0,"Simple bench, easy to construct (5 minutes.) Great for simple workouts; not at all sturdy enough for anything with heavy weights. I tried to create an incline by proping up one side of the bench by stacking a few books under one end; when I layed against it to test it the lower leg bent like tinfoil just from my body weight. I guess I could have realized that ahead of time but seriously I was supprised how easily it bent. You get what you pay for; for $40 bucks I'm still happy with it."

210056,0,"Update: This watch completely died 2 months after I got it, and I was actually happy to have a reason the pitch it into the rubbish bin. Because it was truly rubbish.I got this because I need a calendar on my watch. It has a nice, large display, but I'll often glance down and see that it has either changed from regular to military time, or else the stopwatch is running. I assume it's because the 'buttons' to change these options are aligned along the edge of the watch.Great idea, bad design."
471007,0,"I've been using Body Glide more than once a week for 4-5 years. Body Glide used to be a great product. It's still a decent product, but it seems the water content has been slightly increased. This change has caused a ""paste"" problem. The first time I got a ""paste"" stick from Amazon, I assumed it was a fluke. So, I ordered more from a different on-line company, and unfortunately I have the same issue on multiple sticks from multiple sources.Body Glide is advertised as, ""Dry Non-Greasy Skin Lubricant"". The important word here is ""dry"" and in the past the product has always been dry. I could rub it on with a nice firm stroke and it would really stick right where I wanted. No mess, quick and easy, all set for my ride. The new product is softer and more of a firm paste than a true dry solid. I can't simply rub it on dry like I used to. Now I have to rub in on with light pressure, then spread it around with my fingers a bit, then wipe down the side of the stick since the new product is slightly messy."
386097,1,"I bought two of these knives when they were first issued years ago, and have since carried one or both daily. The originals came &#34;razor sharp&#34; and over the years have been easily maintained that way.Recently, having thought I'd lost one, I ordered a replacement. This replacement was everything I expected, including being identical in quality, razor sharp, every bit as well manufactured and finished as the originals, and at a great price.Having found the one I thought lost, I now have three. I have no reservations in recommending this knife if your needs are met by it's size and design."
253083,1,"Croozer Designs Cargo Trunk Bicycle TrailerI needed a vehicle to recycle metal, aluminum, and copper. I search on the Internet and saw this product advertised. I liked the design and versatility enough to purchase this product. The entire shipment came in one box. I was able to assemble the product within 15 minutes in my kitchen. I have used this product on many occasions. One suggestion that I like to make is that if you are riding your bicycle with the Croozer Designs Cargo Trunk Bicycle Trailer you need to be very careful and ride slow when crossing streets in order to reach another sidewalk. If this product is not leveled at all times, it will flip on it side sending its content outside of it. My overall rating of this product is extremely favorable. The entire unit is easy to store away because it folds into a large rectangle rendering itself ready for storage. I highly recommend the purchase of this item."

343124,0,"Fit and finish were great. The only thing I didn't really like is the fabric was so thin it was almost see-through. I bought these in black and would definitely have to wear black underwear rather than white under these. Still debating as to whether I'll keep them. They are comfy in every other way, so I guess I will keep them to wear & wash and take the risk of having to discard them later. Because of the transparency, I cannot imagine how anyone could wear a color other than black with these and feel comfortable in them. The other factor in my decision to keep these is they were not made in China which were a factor for us as we do not want to support exploiting anyone via sweat shops (and avoiding Chinese factories which are notorious for horrible conditions is our clumsy attempt at trying to do what's right)."
455159,0,"The product works fine, but the first time I used it, the raised crystal on the watch got scratched, directly blocking the time viewing area. Also the numbers (time, heart rate, etc) are of a font that is not particularly easy to read. Other than that, the product is good for the price."

I agree with the other reviewer about the instructions; the're absolutley horrible. Probably about the worst I've seen. Mounting it was pretty easy, despite the instructions, which seem to have been ""written"" by someone who hates people. Really, would complete sentances have been that hard? Anyway, once mounted, I've had a GREAT deal of difficulty getting the thing set up and even getting it from km/hour to mph. Mine may be defective as I followed the ""instructions"" (I use the word loosely here). I did get some of the other settings set. Also, this thing locked into the mount and I can't get it out. It seems cheap to me (and yea, I realize the cost was cheap and I guess you get what you pay for). Anyway, I'm going to throw this thing away (too hard to return and not worth the trouble) and buy something a little bit higher quality. I may come back and edit this review if I ever get this piece of ____ to work. Sorry if this review was unfair in any way but I really don't like this product...UPDATE: well my friend who is a serious cyclist helped me get this set up (he even had a little trouble) and it works great. i've had no problems with it. i still hate the instructions and the set up. it could be that i was just a little crankier than usual when i was dealing with it though..."
60153,0,"I'm 6'3"" 290, first time out I used this seat on a 30 mile ride (probably not the smartest thing to do!). I used the seat for an additional 2 rides of about 15 miles each. I found the sensation weird and found my balance was way off with this seat. I also felt my hands were under a lot more stress than with a normal seat. On the other hand there was no soreness in the perineum that sometimes occurs after a couple hours on the bike with a normal seat.I had a long ride (5 boro bike tour) coming up so I switched back to my conventional seat. I found when switching back that this seat had taught me how to better sit on the conventional seat so that I got the benefits of both."
268128,1,"This is an awesome knife. Cold steel made this thing to last. I've had it for 2 years now and even without sharpening it the blade is still sharp enough to cut anything. I even used it to cut wrapping paper this last Christmas. (I couldn't find the scissors). I've used it to open boxes, chop up food (meat, cheese, veggies, etc), it even makes short work of those annoying plastic packages that everything comes in. There isn't anything flimsy or low quality about it. It folds up nice and solid. I especially found the sharp tanto point useful. Unlike most knives the sharp corner bites into anything I'm trying to cut. This kife is a perfect 10. I can't find anything wrong with it."
46409,0,"First of all I did save a lot of money purchasing this bike rack. It was convenient for me because it seems the only bike racks in my area are for 3 bikes and they are double the price. I did understand as well that this may not be the ideal bike rack given its price and some of the bad ratings on Amazon.This was the first bike rack I bought so I had a learning curve towards mounting the rack. But once I learned, it is not all that difficult to mount. The threads though tend to twist easily if you try to hurry and not pay attention. The straps though do hold the bike securely and I found it easy to get both of my bikes on when needed. My biggest issue though is I just do not trust this bike rack. I live in hilly terrain with curvy roads with its complimenting pot holes. The first time I used it I went on a short trip (8 miles) and when I went to remove the bike the left hook at the top of the trunk had came all the way loose. I fiddled around with it after my biking trip and after 30 minutes I felt confident enough to drive. Next biking trip the same thing happened. Before I left I had spent a lot of time trying to make sure the hooks and straps were evenly distributing the stress of the bike and tied 2 good knots for each strap. Still the left side came loose. Afterwards, I decided I needed to use two rubber hook straps to firmly secure it. Now since I have done that I feel more confident that the rack will be able to perform its duties and now the left side does not loosen.Overall it is not a bad purchase I just do not think it is ideal for bikers that live in hilly or mountainous terrians unless you have ways of strapping it down more securely. The need for some patience if you are a first time user of a bike rack is needed as well."

The ability to zip up the fly to the SUV is very nice for those mid weekend beer runs. the little supported porch is kinda dumb to set up but is nice in case of rain. All in all good tent
104322,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
275707,1,Great item. Make sure you get the right size. There is the 1/2 and then there is the other size. You can't go wrong with these pedals.
79360,0,only had the hat two weeks and it no longer lights up so i guess your batteries no good haven't had money to buy new ones to see if it even still works that way

300351,1,"This is a must have for any gun owner! It eliminates the traditional ""cable"" locks with keys. having the ability to change the combination is very easy and there is no damage to the firearm. Works great on handguns and rifles and keeps the trigger from being pulled. excellent product....I highly recommend it for keeping little hands or unauthorized adult hands safe from potential injury or worse!! I will be purchasing additional locks in the very near future!"
419610,0,"I wear a size 4 - 6 or small in misses' clothing or a 5 - 7 or small in juniors' clothing. Because these shorts are made of a 50/50 poly-cotton jersey knit, I ordered them a size larger than I normally wear--medium--thinking that even though they initially might be a bit big, they would shrink enough to be a good fit on me. Unfortunately, the medium was far too small for me. In fact, I'd guess that the medium would be a perfect fit for someone who normally wears a small. I have reordered the shorts in a large because they are nicely made and exactly what I need. My only complaint is that the sizing seems very inaccurate. They definitely run about a size smaller than other knit shorts in the same size."

438752,0,"Overall, this tent is ok. The one we got was missing the gear loft (I'm hunting around to see if we can get one), and the instructions sewn into the storage bag looked like they were meant for another model of tent. Not a bonus when you're having to set it up at night using lanterns and flashlights. Even the pictures in the instructions didn't match our tent. In the process, one of the tent poles broke, which made matters worse. Thank goodness for duct tape!Once we got it assembled, it worked fine. Good amount of floor space, but I still don't see how they imagine you're getting 8 people in it, unless they're all packed like sardines and don't have ANY extra gear. As a friend said a while back, take those recommendations, and divide by two, if you plan on having ANYTHING but bodies in the tent. Also, be aware that, no matter what it says about the rain, if you get morning dew, ANY place you touch the tent below the rainfly is going to get a bit damp on the inside. Haven't had a tent yet that didn't do it."
147600,1,"The stand arrived on time with all the parts. Assembly was fairly straightforward and required crescent wrenches to tighten the bolts. Placing the handles for pull-ups proved the most challenging, but I finally got them configured correctly with extra effort. Although the stand moves a little when it is in use, it has adequate stability during use. It provides a wide range of exercises using body weight for resistance that gives me a good upper body workout in the convenience of home. It is proving to be a good product for the money."

17754,0,"For those whom are considering buying this product-you don't need another review that praises the ingenuity of the Tent Cot so I'll just give you the gripes.1. Should have included a rainflyFor heaven's sake I could see sunlight through the sewn seams of the roof of the tent which were not taped. A rain fly should not be considered an accessory!!!!!!!!! Yes, I ordered one today.2. The grommets that secure the poles (you insert the poles in these gromments at either end of the tent roof) for the roof were offset from the center of the strap making it difficult to insert the end of the poles. Quality control problem?3. The roof would have been better (in my opinion) as a noseeem roof WITH A RAINFLY INCLUDED!!!!!!!!!4. The instructions are terrible. The setup is simple if you have done it once or twice or have seen it done. Try to figure out the simple setup from the enclosed crude instructions and you will wonder how they can engineer such a great product and stop the process when they got to the instructions-typical old school engineers.5. No UV protection for the fabric expecially for the rainfly (poor show). $13.00 for a bottle of 333 UV did the trick.6. At 40+ pounds I would still be tempted to backpack this in for short trails (no ground sheet, mat, stakes, fly weight) but it is so wide. If they had a couple/decouple in the main tubes so you could fold it in half-that would be the ticket!!!!!!!again a great product but it could be so much more with these little extras.hope this helpsThis would have been a 4 star product if it were not for the above issues.for what is worth...."
324787,1,"I got this grill as a gift from my wife for tailgating and it works great. My friend also got one and we cooked for 20-30 people at our tailgates this season for six games. No problems cooking a variety of food and I didn't experience any trouble with hot spots or putting the lid down. I have a couple minor complaints. One is that the hooks on the front of the grill are so wide that they are pretty useless for hanging cooking utensils on. They just won't fit. I had to set them on the side slide out side shelves, which are awesome, so they take up space I could be using for something else. Also the latch that locks the cover never fails to open when I'm wheeling the grill around. That is super annoying because the grates fall out then you get your hands dirty picking them up. With that said I can't recommend this grill enough. It was perfect for tailgating and never let me down."
443508,0,"So, I bought two of the 20 oz. bottles, mostly on the recommendation of a riding buddy who bought one of the 24 oz. bottles. They seem great, holds water as one would expect. Insulation is reasonable considering the materials it is made from, and relative to competitors... So for all those reasons, that is why I would give this product at least three stars... However that is where it ends, I can not in good conscious rate it any higher. Why you ask? Because unlike any other bottle I have owned, including simply buying a beverage from a convenience store and placing it in the cage, this one accumulates an unusual amount of bacteria in and around the top where you seal the lid.See, inside the bottle, it is designed to have these little concave dimples all along the walls. Well, these little dimples seem to collect bacteria (black and green mould) in these spaces that are sometimes hard to see, and also to reach, in order to clean.I only put bottled or filtered water in these bottles. I have placed them in a dishwasher and hand washed them. The bacteria is hard to remove. You have to find or make a special implement to clean these areas. I ended up using a Q-tip bent at an angle and fastened to the end of a chopstick, in order to reach the desired areas...i have bought and drank out of those 16oz. bottles of water that are so common and often free at large events, and have let them rest on a table for days and sometimes a week, and never have I had an issue with bacteria growing in or around the bottle...So, if you don't want to deal with this issue, do not leave liquids, including water settling inside this bottle. Also when not in use, let them air out and do not store sealed, and rinse before and after use...** I would have bought them here on Amazon, but I needed them that day, and my local REI had them on sale at the time..."
223058,0,"Does anyone use a tackle box for fishing tackle anymore? Anyway, this tackle box holds a lot of stuff! I have my saltwater, trolling, bass gear, and panfish gear all compartmentalized and that part works great. The dividers feel cheap to me, and hooks and swivels seem to always get mixed up underneath the dividers. I'd almost rather just have set compartments without the adjustable dividers so things can't sneak under. The top offers a lot of storage, mine seems to be filled with rubber worm packages and extra line, but it would have been nice if there was a divider made specifically for this space (other than the spinner bait box they sell). Anyway, it works, and I can keep it in my boat for all of my fishing ""expeditions""...Oh yeah, if rain gets on it, everything inside will have to be removed to dry it out - so remember that since not all fishing days are fun in the sun..."

203075,0,"I bought this feeder 5 years ago, mainly because I wanted the directional feed spread. This feeder works very well with pre-processed feed like deer pellets. However, if you use corn it must be clean...no cob or stalk pieces. The motor feed ports are small and will eventually clog if these things are mixed in. But the biggest problem that has recently developed is with varmits. The hopper of this feeder is made of thick plastic, but it didn't prevent my local raccoons from chewing a hold right through the top. It had been about two weeks since last checking the feeder when I found one large hole and one very small hole in the lid. I was amazed! I figured I'd just rivet some sheet metal over the large hole. But after putting the modified feeder back in service, one day later the small hole I didn't cover turned into another very large hole. They were chewing through this thick plastic like butter. I ended up taking the motor assembly and legs off of the plastic hopper and attaching them to a 55 gal steel drum. Problem solved. Although this feeder went 5 years without a hitch, if I bought a new one today, I'd change the hopper immediately."
44399,0,"This riser block has three levels that you can put your front tire in. The highest level makes the bike about level when sitting in my Cycleops Fluid 2 trainer, so the other two level are useless for long rides in the trainer because you are facing down in the front with too much pressure going on your arms, wrists and shoulders.Before I used this riser, I used a automobile ramp that was for driving my car onto to change the oil. This ramp offered much more variation in angles for the bike but would not hold the wheel snug as this riser does. This riser is also portable, as the automobile ramp is not.Ok product, just wish it was constructed to raise the front wheel farther than it does."

I received them in a heather grey colour, even though the packaging still says ""Oxford"". So BEWARE! I don't know if it is a photo error or a packaging error; either way, not worth the postage to return it2. they are small but NOT THAT SMALL! I read the reviews extensively before finally buying them. Previously, someone reviewed saying that she's an S-M and a XL would fit perfectly - which is what I bought. But both pairs arrived amazingly big. I think my boyfriend can wear them! I folded the waistband (note: elastic band, not strings) down twice and the shorts are still too long and too baggy and make my butt look 50% bigger. I'm a size 4 or 6 (ie S or M), and if I were to buy again, I would get size M, or at most L. So be careful when you up the sizes!Unfortunately these were not a good buy for me. I gave it 3 stars, however, because I think if you were lucky enough to get the right size and colour, they would be pretty good and they seem very comfortable."
455340,2,"I purchased the Omron HR-100C, primarily based on it's price. The first watch sent to me responded erratically. While running on a treadmill it was more likely to give a erroneous heart rate, or not work at all, than to give me the information I wanted. I paid $11.50 to UPS to send it back to the company. I also included the required $8.00 check for the return shipping. Omron sent me a new watch and transmitter that lasted for just a few months. Today I took the watch and chest transmitter to the track. The watch is frozen in the stopwatch function displaying 00'00'oo. I won't be making this mistake again. Incidentally, on the back of the watch it says, ""Made In China""."

I looked at vitually hundreds of watches. This watch really fit the mold for me. I was looking for a rugged watch with a steel band. I love the digital display (which I keep permantly on the date)(although it does so much more).The watch looks great and is an impressive piece. Why only 4 instead of 5 stars? First, the latch sometimes comes unhinged on the band causing it to open...loose watch. It never comes loose unless I snag it on something, but still, it should hold a little better. Second, call me anal, but I like to keep the digital second hand even with the analog second hand...doesn't happen. In a matter of days, one is always ahead of the other.The seller was great, although a tad slow on the shipping. Overall, I'm very happy with the watch, and I would definately recommend it to others. Looks and feels great. Another overall victory for Timex."

It arived at my house exactly 4 days after I put an order for it through free amazon shipping, and putting it up was very easy. My mother helped me get the tent'on its feet,' and in five minutes, we had that beauty all set up. The inside was roomy, much roomier than I, or my mother had thought. The only downer is that the bag is very small, so you should read the directions first before putting it back in the bag. Overall, it is the greatest tent in the world."

They are well made, beefy, and feel very cushiony. I wear a size 10 1/2 shoe so I ordered the large. They were snug and I will have to wait and see if they stretch at all. I would definitely order another pair but would go with the next larger size. These socks are built to last a long time and are very comfortable except for the snugness. I wear wool socks all year long because they keep my feet warm and dry. These are excellent socks for wearing outdoors in the winter months and hiking in the sumnmer. They are top notch. Definitely recommend."

438056,0,"Important caveat: my review applies to any rack that only has a single mount point on the seat post. Swaying will *inevitably* occur no matter how tight you attach it if the load is moderately heavy.I have used this rack for a year. I can't give it a good review.This rack sways side to side under heavy load, regardless of how securely you fasten it. It is difficult to secure tightly because it is a quick release. This is a huge problem because metal parts from the pannier frame or from overhanging cargo will get caught in the spokes, and cause an accident or equipment damage. A load less than 15 pounds would not cause problems. As load weight increases, the chances of swaying will increase regardless of how tightly you attach the rack.If your bike can accommodate a multi-point mounted rack like the Topeak Explorer, you would be much better off buying that type of rack. It is cheaper, very easy to install, and more useful in more situations.The only reason to buy this beam rack is if you have a mountain bike with a rear shock or your bike cannot accommodate a multi-point mounted rack for some other reason. Or if you absolutely need the quick release functionality.Among seat post mounted beam racks, I believe this is the best in class. High quality materials and craftsmanship throughout. That's why this gets 3 stars instead of 1.Don't make the same mistake I did, buy a Topeak Explorer if at all possible."

73050,0,"READ THIS REVIEW FIRST ! I normally don't write reviews, but I think this will be very helpful to you. This product is a set tool for a Conibear #220, #330, or #330 Magnum ! Let me tell you, if you do not have this tool, then ""good luck"" trying to set your #330 Magnum Conibear. I spent a bit of time with this tool & a #330 Magnum Conibear trap, & here are my findings. First, this tool appears bigger than it actually is. When the tool arrived, I thought they must have shipped me a smaller set tool by mistake...but in fact, it was the right set tool, but it's just not as big as you would think. Next, this tool is not quite big enough to easily set a #330 Magnum...a #330 Magnum is a very powerful trap & requires a LOT of leverage to set it. When I first tried to set the #330 Magnum with this tool, I could not do it alone...I could not use both hands to scissor this tool on the trap spring, & also attach the safety catch to the spring. I had a friend help me. My friend & I are both average sized men of average strength. I even with help, I could not close the trap. I went to Home Depot & bought 2 sections of black iron plumbing pipe, both sections were 4feet long. I slid a section of pipe over both handles of the set tool, which gave PLENTY of leverage to EASILY close the trap spring. My friend got near the floor to set the spring safety, & I was standing & using the pipes & set tool to close the spring. Just as the spring was nearly fully closed, the center nut & bolt assembly sheared off under the pressure & exploded into the garage & was lost. This set tool is made in China & the center bolt is 6mm & probably a cheap alloy. I went to Ace Hardware to replace the broken nut & bolt assembly, & I purchased a set of metric hardware which are ""hardened grade 10.9"" items, one 6mm bolt, two washers, one nut. I re-assembled the set tool with the new hardware, added the ""cheater bars"" (iron pipes) to the handles, & we tried again. Using the iron pipes as extensions for the tool, & with the hardened metric bolt, the trap spring closed so easily, that I found that I could do it all by myself & set the spring safety all alone. I spent time getting very familiar with the whole rig, & I finally determined what needed to be done to make this a ""professional grade"" set tool. I went to Lowes & bought 2 metal flat steel bars of the same size, thickness, & type that are used on the set tool, & about 4 feet long (they have red paint at the end, they cost about $7 each). I welded those bar extensions to the handles, which now made the set tool MUCH longer, with much greater leverage. If you do this, you need to make sure that you only weld at about 2"" from the end of the handles, otherwise the extra material will be too close to the center nut & prevent the scissor trap tool from closing fully...you want the scissor action to close nearly completely so that the spring is brought almost completely together. The final touch was when I cleaned & degreased the nut & bolt with some spray on brake cleaner, & applied Red Loctite thread locker & let it sit for a day. After those modifications, the improved set tool will close even the most stubborn #330 Magnum Conibear trap. Note: if you buy the set tool but you do not use any of my modifications, then do yourself a BIG favor & just check the nut & bolt assembly to make sure it is tight EACH time you go to try to set the trap...if the nut & bolt assembly is loose, it will ""walk out"" as you scissor the handles...each time you try to close the trap, the nut is spinning off, & after a few tries, the nut & bolt will be unstable enough to explosively shear off, & you could get hurt. Wearing eye protection, thick leather gloves & sturdy boots is a advisable. But if you choose to use any ONE of my suggestions here, then definitely use the Red Loctite to prevent the tool from breaking apart during use."
216097,2,Hi I purchased this to stand in for a temporary mattress and unfortunately in my new apartment with no other mattress I filled it with cool air from blow dryer...built in pump is manual. Anyway no sooner did I lay down but with in three minutes the air is out of mattress and I am sleeping on the floor. Unhappy...I took a chance purchasing on internet and now will have to figure out how to return this while sleeping on a wood floor. When it is briefly inflated I can see that it wasn't a bad idea on my part just a faulty product delivered.

We really liked the low profile of this stove (some others sit up high and we were concerned our dogs who tend to get a little excited may knock the others over). The Coleman canisters can be found nearly everywhere which makes it easy to buy replacements (though we hardly used 1 in our entire weekend of camping). Great for heating up a teapot of water or a pot of chili. No frills but works as expected. Would definetly purchase again but if you're looking to feed a family, consider a 2 burner."

361435,1,"If you travel for work and never know whether you will have a gym nearby this little band fits nicely in a suitcase (it takes up about as much room as two pair of socks). As a woman, I find this to be enough of a workout when I add pushups, sit-ups, dips, lunges and squats to the band workout. However, men may find one of these is not adequate tension for a good workout. The handles are small, and I would suggest buying two to provide extra tension for those more serious exercisers.The manufacturer printed a diagram of the exercises on the face of the band, which is quite helpful. The exercise name and muscles worked listed on the band are as follows:Lower Body workout1. Leg Lift (buttocks)2. Leg Extension (quadriceps)3. Outer Thigh Lift (abductors)4. Inner Thigh Life (abductors)5. Lower Back and Leg Stretch (calf/hamstring)6. Leg Curl (hamstring)Upper Body workout1. Arm Raises (deltoids)2. Arm Curl (biceps)3. Stretch Out (shoulders/back)4. Arm Extension (triceps)5. Back Row (Lats)6. Chest Fly (pectorals)Once you get used to this band you will find that you can use it for exercises that aren't on the band. One example of this is a tricep exercise that I do where I grip the band with one hand that is placed in the middle of my back. The other hand is behind my neck holding onto the handle. I pull the top hand toward the ceiling. If you have enough tension on the band this makes a nice tricep workout.The exercises that you can do with this band are only limited by your imagination. If you want a product that takes up very little space in a suitcase but is still an effective exercise device I would recommend that you give this product a try."

185372,0,"This should not be considered a standalone lock for a high risk area, but it is a quick and handy way to make your bike a little less attractive to steal. The ease of use ensures that it will get used frequently, and any lock has to be better than nothing at all.My preferred use for this lock is as a backup for a good U-lock. With both locks, the bike looks fairly unfriendly for carrying away, and it allows you to lock the front wheel without removing it, which I find quite a pain."
374067,2,"Well when I received this gun i thought it was great looking for its price and it came with some cool stuff. However I tested it out in my living room and when I shot a piece of foam from 10 feet away with .12gm bb's, it didn't even penetrate the foam. This lead me to think that the guns fps was much lower than expected. I took it to the air soft factory and had it chronograph ed before I entered the game area. It registered as 80-95 fps which goes about 35 feet and then falls to the floor. My cheap sidearm even went 280 fps which shows you that this gun is a piece of trash. Considering that i shot myself in the leg in fully auto mode and didn't really feel it from 5 inches away, this gun deserves a 1 star out of 10 stars... However it looks nice"
381360,0,"I bought this pedometer two years ago. My main complaint with the OMRON is that it was bulky and fell easily when I bent over. It worked well at first, then started to undercount my steps. Frustrated, I stopped using it. I started using it again a couple of months ago. This time, after a long rest, it was again accurate. But alas it died (it refuses to count any step, even with a fresh battery.) I had paid over $50 for it, and only got about 10-12 months worth of use. I didn't think it was that good, so I replaced it with an Ozeri tri-axis: that one seems to systematically overcounts my steps sometimes by 20%, counts bumps on the road when driving, etc..... so in retrospect, this OMRON pedometer wasn't that bad, especially now that the price has come down. I am going to buy an OMRON pedometer again, one without the software option, which I found useless, and obviously not one with the tri-axis option. They are too sensitive."

384018,1,I purchased this bike for my son when he was 4. He is now 9 and doesn't ride it anymore. This bike has never given me any problem other than the training wheels wore out as my son rode the bike so much. The bike is very good quality considering it was not made in the USA. I would highly recommend this bike to anyone looking for a first bike for a kid. My son is now riding a geared mountain bike and still occasionally asks if he can ride his baby bike. It is funny to see him on the bike now but is is still holding up. I think it is time to donate it to goodwill.

204525,0,"When I first recieved this sword through the mail it was like the best thing ever. Looked exactly like the one in Final Fantasy and it was huge. There was really nothing wrong with it until that one day when I happened to drop it while cleaning it. Then I found out that the blade isn't actually connect to the handle and the guard. When the sword fell on the ground the top part of the guard that covered the inside got dented inward and it was loose. I moved the piece up and figuered out that the blade actually moved up. I looked inside under the top sheet of metal that was covering the guard and I realized that there was a round piece of wood inside the guard going down to the handle and that they just glued the piece of wood there and shoved the blade into it then glued the top part of the guard onto the wood to cover everything else. I pushed the blade back in to where it was before, but I don't think I'll be swinging it around anymore because you can't really risk it flying off and killing someone... It better off if you buy a case/stand or make one and stick it in there for display because one drop can ruin it all, but there really isn't a better replica beside this one.EDIT: Had someone with the same problem and they didn't want their sword anymore and we decided to take it apart and have a closer look. The handle of the sword is completely hollow same with the guard. In the handle there is a cylindric piece of wood that is shoved down the handle and glued with wood or super glue to the sides of the handle on the inside. The Blade extends all the way down in full size to the end of the guard then it narrows down to around the width of the handle which is around a little over an inch.. the blade also gets thinner and is around 1-2 millimeters thick compared to the thick part of the blade on the top which is 5 milimeters thick... for people who don't understand this take a look at one of your regular small knives that you use to cut food and etc with. That should be around 1 millimeter. That part of the blade extends almost all the way down the piece of wood and the handle. I REALLY wouldn't consider this full tang but they twisted the meaning around. The blade isn't welded onto the handle or the guard. So they're really like 2 separate pieces. Pretty cheap if you ask me...."

20896,1,"Arrived 3 days ahead of schedule!Good watch so far. I've had it for a little longer than 2 weeks and I've used it sea-kayaking, flown cross-country and worn it every day. No scratches yet. It is a big watch and the band is loose even on the tightest setting (admittedly I'm not the biggest guy but I am athletic, as I presume most users of this watch will be so you may want to change the band). All the functions are very accurate but I am most impressed with the weather forcast. It predicted a sudden New England rain shower when everyone else (even local Maine fishermen) swore it would be clear all day (we were even at the beach and it saved the day when our party left about 5 minutes before the rain started coming down putting us way ahead of the resulting traffic). It does require input however, in order to work well. Use this website ([...]) to calibrate the baro to your location (go to WikiHow to learn how to read a 'METAR') for the most accurate weather and alti functions. You'll need to do that evey time you travel someplace far or dramatically different from the previous setting. Compass is OK but you have to hold your wrist in a certain position, the calibration procedure will leave you dizzy and it only works well outdoors but still, it DOES work. I haven't noticed any of the poor water-seal issues lamented by others. I've washed the dishes with it and it took a decent sloshing on one particularly rough kayaking trip with no problems. The thermo is pretty worthless but I figured it would be since the sensor sits so close to your skin. It's usable, however, if you subtract about 13 deg F from the reading. The bezel rotates which is handy for some more involved navigation practices. No problems with random button pushing. Watch the DVD, it helps (esp. with the compass cal).Gripes? The loose watch band, the thermo and it looks too much like everybody's Timex Triathlon. But that's really about it. Great watch!"

332626,1,The Protege computer was easy to setup and works well after it is configured. Make sure to read the instructions carefully for the initial setup. Once I set it up I haven't had to worry about it. It is easy to change modes while on the ride. The computer itself is well sealed and seems resistant to water. I rode through a rain storm and didn't have any problems. I have used it for about 400 miles so far.My only gripe is the max speed sensor sometimes gives erroneous readings. I think this has to do with either hitting a bump or rolling back when starting from a stop. I will occasionally get 70-90mph max speed readings which are obviously false. This doesn't seem to change the average speed much so it is a minor issue.

378014,1,"Very nice finish, mine has a light mount on the rear, and extra hardware and hex key is a nice touch. Mounted on a rack friendly 90's hardtail Trek MTB with 1.9 rear tire in about ten minutes - simple. Although accurately described, the top platform is just about 12"" long, and a little on a narrow side. It looks undersized on my MTB. In comparison, my Jandd Expedition measures 15"" on the top platform and is wider, a pretty big difference. Not necessarily a negative, it's light and hardly bulky, and it does the job. I guess if you were putting this on a sleeker road bike this size would be actually be a plus. Universal? I think it will fit the majority of bikes that are rack friendly, i.e. have mounting bosses and a fairly conventional chainstay distance. I suspect the largest frames will have fit problems."

Since this one is ""body-skimming"" as the description aptly notes, and since it is not at all stretchy, which the description did not note, larger busts might get a little smashed, and for me, the arm holes gapped a lot due to the less than ideal fit.

If this happens to you Do Not remove the broken peice. Doing so will throw the balance of the knife making it much harder to flip. Other than a short lifespan, the knife needs oiled once in a while. Those are the negitives. The positives are: works well, great for training or experimenting, and you will not get cut."
445607,0,"I had seen the reviews on here previously that expressed some concern over the size of this case. However I checked on Oakley's official website and this was the recommended size case for my Oakley Whisker Polarized glasses. So undaunted I purchased them here on Amazon.Let me start by saying that they do fit, but the fit is incredibly tight, in fact so tight that I have gotten my Whisker's stuck in there once and decided never to use the case again.The case itself is well made, but I'd much rather not risk getting my ~$200 Prescriptions stuck in there or damaged in the case. Another downside is that it does not fit my 31Thirteen's either that I use for my daily prescription.If I could do it over again I would have ordered the Medium Sized Soft Vault (my order from my Optometrist apparently included the Medium Soft Vault with my Whiskers) which fit the Whiskers and my 31Thirteen's quite well (although they do have room to roll)."

272661,1,These are very well made and take a beating. I cut out the roll in the palm to use them for MMA training. The wrist wrap feature is great for hard hitting (similar to their lifting gloves). Overuse of these gloves seems to make wrists weaker because of all over-support they provide to the wrist during punching. I use them once in a while but prefer a light bag glove with a looser wrist to increas arm strength.
4302,2,"The binoculars didnt work for myself well or the kids. Optics in the lower price range rarely do. The flashlight sucks. The whistle is cheap compared to the orange safety ones you can find in camping supply stores for a few bucks. The compass comes with no instruction valuable to preteen age kids. I cannot find anything nice to say about this kit. Buy your kid something else. Maybe one nice item, with a book on how to use it."

Of course Under Armour is wildly popular right now, and he wanted these because of that fact.However, the socks are thin synthetic material and fit somewhat tight on his average sized leg, and they made his feet sweat. I also thought they were overpriced for the quality. We liked the Mizuno Performance Solid Color Sport Socks better for the same price, although the ""stylish"" logo isn't easily visible while wearing them."

174208,1,"These pants satisfy everything I was looking for in a pair of work-pants. I am a claims adjuster and as part of my job, I generally spend 1 - 2 hours per claim on the structure's roof. Living in Texas, this can be EXTREMELY hot and my cotton Polo Chinos weren't cutting it as the cotton was like a sauna thereby not letting me stay (relatively) cool. So I wanted some pants that would achieve this but that were also stylish. These pants not only fit the bill on those accounts, but they have numerous deep pockets that let me secure my gear without worrying about my tape measure or other equipment falling off of the roof or me having to make more than 1 trip to get what I need on the roof with me. I am definitely going to buy more of these and I recommend them 100% for anyone who wants a stylish pant and who works in a hot environment and needs to carry various tools."
288010,0,"The cotton of the pants is good quality. The pants themselves are good quality. However, the elastic around the waist I found way too tight, even though the pants fit well otherwise. I gave my pair to my husband because he could deal with the tightness around the waist. But then, as he wore them, the elastic at the ankles completely gave up the ghost after just a couple of washings. A case of ""too much and too little."" I wouldn't buy this product again."
327667,1,Out of all the sweaters that i have this is the best! Its very comfortable:) i feel like a Fluffy Bear when i wear this:) it keeps me very warm... and its also very stylish:D i accidentally made a mistake by ordering a bigger size but its doesnt matter.. its still pretty comfortable:D I would reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a stylish and comfty sweater!:D
259345,2,"This is another of those things that I bought that seemed like a good idea at the time, but in the field, it did not prove to be useful... If I were you, I would stay away from it.. It just is not a usuable product... Looks nice, but is a waste of your money. You will play with it for awhile, like I did, then that will be the end of the attention it gets... Just get some micro clothes at the dollar store and move on.. I actually put my micro cloths in a ziplok bag to keep dust, sand, etc off of them. and you can laundry them.. Along these lines, I prefer an item I do use a lot and that is those lens cleaner pen/brushes that is sold here by different vendors. Has a retractable brush on one end and a lens cleaner pad on the other. I use these a lot.... One should however to be sure when using them to use the brush first to get the grit off the lens before using the cleaning pad... Just a good common sense approach, etc....."
240795,0,Its well balanced in the hand however the locking buttons are so firm they hurt my fingertips to push and the lanyard ring took a bit to find. The pliers were made in Taiwan and the rest of the multitool was constructed out of china; I was a bit bummed to read that. The spring loaded pliers are nice - Only thing I think it is missing is a nail file and maybe a awl or gut hook would have been nice instead of scissors and the serrated knife =) Next time I think I will go with SOG because they let you customize their multitools

This is false I used that buyers review and before I received my order went ahead and bought the wedge putter combo (as it was only about $30) I received my order in a very prompt fashion. But was surprised when this was a FULL COMPLETE set. I have not had a chance to use them but again as other reviews point out the driver is NOT short... and neither am I. I am 5'11 and have been golfing for about 8 years and had absolutely no problems with any of the lengths. The grips all feel amazing as do the balance of the clubs. All clubs are meticulously wrapped (excessively so). The only real complaint I have with this set is the bag stand; when fully extended, sits fairly low. Other then that a great buy!!!"

56479,2,"The design of the shirt looked nice online ... but for more than 30 bucks, it was a rip-off. The fabric is cheap and thin, the button threads are weak and look like they'll give out at any moment, and the logo on the back of the shirt is painted on as opposed to embroidery (this last bit really bugged me). All-in-all, this shirt makes for an interesting photograph ... but for a bowling shirt? Come on. It isn't built to take the stress of an evening out bowling with the gals."

403334,2,"This is my first time reviewing an item ....... but I feel the need to set the records straight. I have purchase 6 O'brien tubes over the years, but I bought my boys Airheads Christmas 2010 because of the positive reviews. And don't get me wrong - it is a decent product. BUT - we're on the second season of the two Airheads tubes and I've had to repair them with Aqua Seal 5 times. One of the tubes is beyond repair. The heat stitch popped and now it looks like a balloon. I'm switching back to O'brien. My boys are rough on tubes, but O'brien definately masters the race for endurance year-over-year."
413460,0,"Seemed nice enough--until it was washed. It shrunk in the length, although not badly, but...the sleeve length changed considerably. Consider ordering a tall if you need longer sleeves."
468870,1,"I read all the reviews of people whining about the fit and what not. I haven't a clue what they're on about. I have a 1928 91/30 with a hex receiver. It fit perfectly! a bit snug, but I used my man hands to force it in all the way, and boom goes the dynamite."
192261,1,"I fell in love with Under Armour's products four years ago, and that hasn't changed.They were still a niche brand then, on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ...Gear products are the reason why. They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first, not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams. I tried some of the competitors first, but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one. I'm glad I did. The HeatGear material is perfect. It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me, that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version. I like the sleeveless version for working out, because it helps your range of motion with your arms. The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt, but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt. UA has started to offer a sleeved ""Tactical"" version of the shirt, which I might buy one or two, but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton. The hold you in place. You are not as hot as some may be while working hard. You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money, and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can."
409662,0,"I purchased this clothing tree without reading that it is youth. Despite this, I am pleased with the product I received. The paint detail was nicely done. Assembly was a breeze.This was a gift for a Mets fan. Even though it is a youth product, we hang out clothes on it. It works fine. It's sturdy and has not tipped over even under the weight of several layers of adult clothing.The only complaint I have for the manufacturer is that the package arrived with 3 stickers on 3 different sides of the box that showed the product. This was ordered as a gift, so when it arrived, the recipient knew what was in the box immediately."
82059,0,The only problem is I think they run just a little smaller than other athletic shorts in the size small.
112228,0,These are very light weight and not very sturdy. They will do in a pinch for example if your car breaks down in the rain they will be a welcome item. I recommend them for one time or limited use but that is it. Not bad for the price.

95597,0,"I was pretty much a beginner as far as throwing darts went when I ordered these. I tried to do a little research before buying these, but I really didnt know what I wanted. I ended up ordering them cause of the name: ""Bombs Brian Kincaid"" ;.)Now that I've thrown darts for a little while, I think I'd prefer a smooth straight barrel, but for this review, I'll try and just stick to things not related to preference.Here's a couple +/-'s:+ they look sweet. glossy black w/ shiny silver. the flights that came with them match them well- the tip doesn't stay tightly fastened to the barrel. Some O-rings were included, but I couldn't figure out how they're supposed to fit. Ended up jimmy-rigging it up, and now they seem OK.- the movable points seem to move too much. I dont know if they're supposed to... but I had thought it would be some kind of spring mechanism. You have to pull out the tips in order to reset them. There's no springs (to be fair, I don't know if ANY tips operate with a spring).+ the shafts are well built, and stay attached to the barrel pretty well.- the tips seem to be getting rusty / discolored.+ the price: about half the price of similar darts you'd find at a local shop.Overall, I'm satisfied. Next time, however, I'll try and throw with a few different barrel types for awhile before buying a set. Would I purchase again from US Darts? maybe. (depends on how much money I have and how into darts I really get). I'd like a better made tip and a spinning shaft."
117302,1,"I was unsure about this item, never bought stuff on amazon until I decided to buy this seat for my son. I am very impressed with the service of amazon , and also with the this bike seat.The ibert is so easy to put together and it just works great.I am the only person that has it in the area and I already have 4 parents interested in getting it because it just works so good. I don't regreat this purchase at all and my son loves to be close to me as we ride our bike."
131397,0,"very lightweight, really hard to notice that you have it on, its pretty smaller and never seems to get caught on anything. So far keeping time very well. It was easy to set and no problems with showering with it.just wish it was luminous, I really cant read it in the dark."
317634,1,"I have an inguinal hernia and this inexpensive device has saved me from untold discomfort until I can have surgery. It works great, is easy to fit and adjust, and it is comfortable, fitting discretely under my clothing. It is very similar to wearing a jock strap. Cons: Urinating from the standing position can be difficult and keeping the straps from irritating your legs can be a hassle. Overall, considering the cost and the end result of alleviating pain and allowing one to function near-normally this is a great buy."

I probably would not go back again to buy another - I might try for a cotton/polyester blend next time."
225606,0,Get a size smaller than you normally wear. The cut is quite generous. I was swimming in the Large I ordered using the company sizing guidelines.
250818,2,The riser ring is not sturdy enough to provide the support to hold the front wheel. Found the riser shifting and moving as I stood up to pound the pedals. The Cyclops riser is much sturdier and worth the extra money.
142044,1,Love the head set. Works good with my glasses and hat. There is white noise but if you double up with plugs can't even hear. Should of bought one of these too start off with then all those other ones.
486545,0,"It gets a huge bubble on the surface, came out after using it for a month, makes it uncomfortable to sleep on. That is not from over inflation. The good thing is that it has no holes after almost a year of use."
417338,0,We bought this bike about a month back for our son- he is 2 years and 5 months old. He hasn't learnt how to pedal yet so the real test will be when he starts pedalling and we'll have to see how long the bike lasts. It seems like a good buy for the price though- looks good- our son loves it. Only issue is that the foot stand in between dosent have enough space for his 2 feet. The assembly was also not very difficult- took my husband around 3 hours.
431965,0,"I'm put off by the chemicals in this spray. It contains pyrethrins which is toxic to animals and fish.It is said to be a safer alternative to other pesticides because it breaks down itself in 5-7 days, which is better but far from good. Because of it's chemical break down, it's considered ""organic"". It is not a safe product and I won't have any pyrethrins on my tomatoes and vegetables.If you do use this product, take all the necessary precautions in reducing the risk to animals."
478706,2,"At first glance, it was a good buy. The passenger area is roomy, the attachment is simple, and the bike is stable and easy to handle with it on.HOWEVER...The front area, where the child must stand to get in, is fabric. Not reinforced fabric, not fabric with a sheet of pressboard. JUST fabric.Worse, this area is held to the frame by three strips of velcro stitched into the seam. It took ONE use for the first strip to rip out, and less than a week for the other two to do so. After that, if my children didn't keep their feet on the bar when riding, they'd hit their feet on the ground as we rode.But it gets worse.The bar that holds the trailer to the bike is riveted. Loosely. This means that after a time or two using it, it becomes ""floppy"". There's play in it, and it sags... meaning that in use, the trailer tips down in front. Since there's nothing to support the easily-stretched-out fabric of the floor, and the children are only keeping their feet off the ground by resting them on the frame-bar, this is makes for very dangerous riding.After a week of use, there was a hole in the floor. After two months of using, it was 100% unsafe.Most annoying of all? Although there's a separate cargo-space in back, there's nothing separating the floor. (The afore-mentioned saggy cloth floor.) So if you stick something in the cargo area -- say, a bag of lunch -- it winds up down by the children's feet. There's no partition to stop it from rolling forwards as the trailer tilts.The irony is that for the same price, you can find trailers with reinforced floors, welded joints, snug & secure fabric, and a SEPARATE cargo area."
67092,2,"When I received this poker chip set, I was shocked to see how bad the case was. Once the case was opened; it took me a good 5 minutes to close it back. The lid was very unstable; and would not close properly. The case is very cheap. If you are buying this; for sure you will be looking for a new case after a few use."
329158,2,"I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise. Just to be safe I ordered a large. The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long. The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg."
167595,2,"Long ago, Buck put as much care into grinding and finishing the steel parts of the MiniBuck as they did with the legendary 110. Everything fit together perfectly.About 10 years ago, Buck got really sloppy with the MiniBuck and never got better again. Like Buck's other bottom-rung models, they now do what looks like a single-stage grind to bevel the blade (no brushing or buffing to finish it), leaving an extremely rough grind which not only looks and feels bad, but doesn't match the flat parts. Another issue is that a very rough surface holds onto grime (especially tape gunk), and is not easy to clean.The blade and lock bar don't fit together very well. The lock bar looks like it doesn't click in all the way and is not level with the blade or handle.It's still a functional knife, but it's not visually impressive and probably not very suitable as a gift unless you find it for a very steep discount at a large store (sometimes they use these as discount leaders) and are on a strict budget."
193870,2,I was looking forward to carrying these on trips and not carry a mat. These socks slip too much and actually mess up my balance! Don't waste your $!
21813,0,"Okay, I'm not a dummy and I did put it together after a reasonable amount of time but the pictures and instructions in the booklet is not great. The Ab Lounge Sport should come with a step by step dvd. Overall, the product works great."
204506,0,"I bought these compression tights to wear everyday during the winter in New England. The material is great; it's comfortable and keeps me warm. The only problem is the elastic at the bottom which cuts off the circulation in my feet. I've tried pulling the end over my socks or rolling them up to my ankles, but the elastic is too tight for my comfort. I'm 5'3"", 115 pounds, and I bought a small. I love Under Armour, and I recommend the fitted leggings which do not have the elastic band at the bottom end."

38686,2,"These breeches were NOT cotton. They were a polyester/spandex blend, so I returned them. If polyester works in your climate, they were very nice breeches, but in 110+ heat, poly is a no-no. The seller said they would fix the link to the product description, and they may have, but be aware."
11867,0,"I bought this vest from Amazon for less than 30$. At that price, it isn't a steal, but it's also not like you're wasting your money. The Cathedral Peak vest feels highly synthetic, but is well seamed and finished. The fit, like other reviewers have pointed out, is tight (I'm skinny, but it's barely loose around my body, and I'm talking about size M). For me, that's a plus, as I don't like the ""garbage bag poncho"" look, but you might like it that way. In terms of insulation, the plastic fabric shows its worth (could make you sweat a lot in a humid environment). Seems like a good choice for a desert/mountain environment, which is where I live.I've docked two full stars because of a simple fact: the pockets. They're horrible. The zippers open UPWARDS, when most technical clothing goes the other way around (and they chafe quite a bit). Worse, the pocket liner is a solid polyester fabric, instead of light mesh or microsuede like in better products, even from Columbia. I don't know about you, but I care about vest pockets very much, and these were a total disappointment. These people should know better.In short: it's a warm, fitted, cheap, plastic vest with terrible pockets. Still, it serves its role."
87967,0,"It is soft and fleecey and it looks good. The charcoal is a very nice color. The problem is that there's no hand warmer pocket in the front. I know, I know...I should have looked closer. Well, I didn't, and now whenever I wear it, I find myself trying to put my hands into a front pocket that isn't there.Another slightly annoying thing is that the wrist cuffs are pretty tight, so if you try to push your sleeves up to do something, it can be somewhat uncomfortably tight.On the positive side, it is a nice warm underlayer and is a clean, casual look with jeans. I like it, I just wish it had pockets."
107985,1,had this for a week now and I think I like them. The latex smell is present but not unbearable.
316004,0,"These were very cheap pants, and as the saying goes; you get what you pay for. Everything seems to stick to these pants because of the cheap material. They are sufficient for just a workout, but far from something you would want to wear in a demo or any display!"
469783,0,"Weight is on the lite side, feels good in the hand. Releases smoothly. Had to add weight by using 550 cord and tape on the handle, still lite. Then tried using just a leather handle, still a lite throw. The best throwing knife I have so far is the SOG Seal Pup after that would be Cold Steel True Flight Thrower. Only because I've replaced the 550 cord Handel several times after cutting the cord with the follow up throw."
157719,0,"I'm picky when it comes to tanks. Fit is priority and this fits well. Not too tight and the armholes are sufficient without forcing a wardrobe malfunction. That's the good.It's a bit odd that they call it ""heavyweight"". If this is heavyweight, the lightweight tank must be saran wrap because this is the thinnest shirt I own, including a 15 year old tee that I wear all the time. This tank is a bit revealing but that just may be the color I bought (yellow). Overall, it's ok though. I'd buy another in a darker color, mainly because of the fit. I do wish it were a little thicker material, not just for coverage but because I'd like it to last longer."
4802,1,"Really a nice set, chips real CLAY no cheap plastic !Trust in this set and you'll be happy !"
370268,0,This was a little too sweatery and not jackety enough for me. Too slouchy and not as structured as the picture looks. I have other Marmot jackets I like better. I sent it back.
232294,1,This is a really cool nipper. If you love flyfishing as much as I do you will be stoked to clip this nipper to your vest.
125873,2,"The M3 is probably a great watch, but the manual is so minimalist that I'll prob never figure it out. It really needs a menu hierarchy/map so you can figure out where to find the various functions."
361598,1,"Light weight, good quality leather.Came inflated just the right pressure.Nice finish and workmanship.Don't know how long it will last. The last one I bought had a crack in it so it was leaking all the time."

210631,1,"Ordering, and receiving was an easy process. Product came in a reasonable time and in good shape. I couldn't be happier!"
416796,0,"It's just a short. Quite mediocre in quality, hence the 3 stars. I didn't have high expectations for this short since I was trying to meet a minimum total for an offer and I would only use it to lounge in. The material is a bit more rough than expected. And the red is much brighter than in the pictures. The only major issue I may see for others is the discomfort that may be caused by chafing by the inner elastic band."
510492,1,"This mattress is excellent for the price. Others complained about smell so I was concerned mine would have that problem too. I ordered it for guests and wouldn't want them to be uncomfortable. There was an odor upon opening the box but after we aired it out overnight, it was fine. The mattress held air all night. It was easy to set up and comfortable to sleep on, despite the thin profile."
97709,0,"I had a problem with the arbors, they fit very loose on all my rifles, I was mainly looking to be ""on paper"" at 50 yards, but this boresighter was not the answer, I thought I could make it work, but all the adjustments were off, I mean, way off. It is still sitting on a shelf."
12927,1,I bought this stop watch for work. We need something that times up to 15 minutes normally sometimes more. As well we needed something that read temp in C not F as well humidity. This does it all and it will change humidity fast and accurate. Only issue I had was a small scratch on the screen of the stop watch as well when I ordered it on a Wednesday and he didn't provide the shipping label till near the end of the day on Friday. I didn't recieve it till Thursday afternoon the next week. But other than that I'd give it a 4 out of 5. Works great so far!!
316571,0,"Completely satisfied with the shorts. That said, they came with, for lack of a better word, a scuff mark on the back right side. As if they were worn and the wearer slid on cement or something. Not a big deal to me, but still curious."
62152,0,"First of all, it's a great bottle. I love the bite-valve, the design, everything about it. The only problem I had was when I ordered the color ""ICE"" version of this bottle (which it shows on the website as transparent or white), I was sent a Light Blue version of the bottle. It wasn't worth the trouble to return it for a different color, so I just kept it. By the way, I got the sleeve for this to prevent sweating (which covers up the color anyway)."
140524,0,"i read a lot of reviews before purchasing this game, but i finally got it yesterday and tried it out by creating a custom work-out just to see what exercises were available. i can tell you that my work-out was only 12 min. and i was definitely sweating afterwards.this game definitely provides more of a work-out than wii fit and has much more of a ""serious tone"" than wii fit. i think even the basic or beginner levels on this game are more intense than anything on wii fit, but i think wii fit is more of a concentrated balance improvement game, whereas this is more of a physical exercise game.overall this seems to be a great game if you want to really, really work-out like you would at the gym or in an exercise class and probably would be nice along with the wii fit to mix things up a bit.pros:-intense work-out-variety of exercises is great-better music than wii fit, although i really didn't notice it much while doing the exercises-nice graphics, nothing fancy-just nice-can do a complete work-out without having to stop and select excerises after completing 1 exercise-can customize a work-out, do 30 day challenge, or choose a pre-selected work-out-includes additional sports games such as volleyball and basketball techniques and in-line skatingcons:-the leg strap didn't stay on through any exercise. i either had to hold it with my left hand or let it fall off and pick it up after each exercise.-the avatar's response is not as good or responsive as the wii fit's, which is probably the biggest flaw for me. my avatar would perform movements that i wasn't doing. i especially found this to be true during the track exercises. i would be standing still and the avatar would already be running around the track and i would get the ""perfect form"" response when i was standing still. this could be due to improper holding of the remote, which seems to take some trial and error, but still...wii fit does a much better job of this.-have to hold remotes in exact position or it won't register your response or give an improper response.-had to maunally enter weight and doesn't seem to track weight gain or loss-not as much fun as the exercises on wii fit"
344952,1,This is an ideal entry level hoop for the price. The thing I wanted to note most is one person can put together without any help. The trick is to assemble the base and pole separate(deviate from the instructions). Once everything is together place the base against something solid(wall) and slide the pole with backboard and rim attached into the slot at the bottom(it has wheels). Once the bar is set in the groove raise the pole to a vertical position and the second bar will snap into place. Then attach the brackets from the base to the pole and you are done. Took me 30 minutes but it does take some time to figure out the instructions as there are only diagrams with no written instruction.Good luck!
115889,0,I do Bikram 5 days a week so I thought a nice mat was something I should havethe mat is nice it has nice cushion my towel sticks very wellIt is heavy but not to the point where its a hassle to carryMY biggest problem is how it moves around during class it literally shifts the hole class which drives me nuts I like to stay aligned with the mirror and sometimes its moves so much I have to stop and move it back I am practicing on carpet in a standard Bikram room I don't see other people having to adjust their mats. So Im thinking of how I can alter it to make it stop moving. I would not buy this mat again because of this issue
29371,0,"When the item arrived, it did not have a padded seat as described. Also, I think the cord intended to pull the boggon is far too short. However, since I gave this item as a gift, I can't comment on actual usage. Finally, the item is shipped in an Amazon shipping box, with no additional packaging. I had to turn the boggon into a ""gift boggon"" filling it with other gifts and wrapping it like a gift basket."
105081,2,"I bought it and thought it would be ok for my folding bikes; however on the product description page, it didnot specify what type of bikes it is tended for.

91568,0,"Matt clearly takes pride in his endeavors; yet, he showed no attempt to apply this work ethic to presenting knowledge. The look and feel of this book, the exercise descriptions, the graphics, the navigation devices, all are horrible. This is true for all of his books and videos.I believe Matt wants us to believe he is trying to match his products to his crass persona...and that would be fine. But the truth is his books and videos are simply unprofessional. They lack good topical structure, information presentation, etc. Basically, there is a general lack of respect for books and video creation.So why three stars? Because content is king! And Furey's books/videos have rock solid and usable content. Most of his exercises work. Period. And his advice, although not explained very well, is more solid than most polished fitness books.Again, there is nothing wrong with having a crass persona. We all love Mickey (from Rocky), but 'Mickey' was delivered via fantastic actors, sets, writers, and directors.Matt's philosophy (psycho-cybernetics) allowed him to be a champion wrestler and very skilled speaker and advertiser. He just needs to apply himself more toward his books/videos."
356256,2,"The ball was fine, average, nothing wrong with it. But the instructional DVD that came with it didn't work, it read ""disk error"" on all of my DVD players and would not load on my computer either. Per Amazon's policy, I attempted to contact the company first, multiple times, I finally received a rude reply that they only replaced things bought on their webside. So much for a company standing by it's product! When I contacted Amazon customer service with this information, they fixed the problem immediately. GO AMAZON!! I would NEVER by another product from The Firm again!"

187250,0,"My current pair of workout pants were recently retired when the draw string to keep them in place ripped, leaving me in constant fear that they would fall at any moment. I ordered these because I know the Adidas name, as pretty much everyone does. They feel like a quality product, the only problem is they are so big. The waist isn't an issue because the drawstring can always be adjusted, but the leg length is just way too long. The legs constantly drag, which isn't good during a workout. It's distracting and it'll cause the pants to show signs of wear and tear faster then they should. I guess I could have ordered a smaller size, but I'm 6 foot nothing and haven't worn an XL in anything since about highschool."
287053,1,This was part of the base layer I used while I took a weeklong vacation dog sledding in the Yukon Territory. These were integral in keeping me warm and wicking away the sweat you are going to work up while pushing a dog sled up a hill and keeping you warm when you need them too. If they can keep me warm in -40F weather they should work for almost anything you can throw at them.
222418,2,"I think weightlifting gloves are one of those items that you really need to try on before purchasing. Nevertheless the price was right on Amazon so I took the plunge only to find out that the size wasn't ideal. I'm somewhere between a L and an XL, but the way these gloves were made I don't think either would have fit me quite right. The gloves look ok, but there was some strange sewing/fabric near the fingers that just irritated me enough to not want to wear them when lifting. Ever since my wife made me start lifting with gloves to avoid those manly callouses I can't lift without them, but I much prefer the Nike strength gloves which are made of a much thinner fabric and have a zipper to close as opposed to irritating velcro."
487632,0,Not the best quality set. I probably expected better for the price but it was about the Univ of Washington logo for my diehard Husky husband. He used them once and said they were kind of flimsy. They are now decorations hanging on the grill while he uses a more sturdy bbq tool set.

171512,1,"I own 3 self-inflating air-mattresses, the Coleman Queen GuestRest Airbed is the last one purchased and the best of the 3. I've had it for a couple of years and it has held up great. The air pump is quick and the bladder has remained leak-free. It is easy to fill or break-down and stows away in a relatively small case. If anyone tells you it sleeps like a real bed, though, they are crazy. It is a comfortable air-mattress, but is is still an air-mattress."

359964,2,"The longer that I box, the less impressed I am with Everlast products. From double end bags tearing after a couple of weeks to hand injuries from Everlast gloves, my opinion of Everlast is declining precipitously. This swivel came with their entry level speed bag kit. I wanted a speed bag set to train with when I am not at the gym. The product is complete garbage. The action is terrible. Do not waste your money on this product. Pay the extra 10 dollars and get a decent swivel."
229457,1,"After reading a lot of reviews for similar products complaining of terrible smells and shoddy construction, I was worried that there weren't many good options. Shoes seen around the dojo that appeared to be online were not rated that well. With these shoes, no bad smells, comfort and quality was fine. Hoped to find a shoe that covered the laces and/or no laces, but these shoes are comfortable and haven't been an issue with untying."
115320,1,"We purchased this camera soon after we bought our canoe. Using some conduit hanger for electrical wires, I rigged up a bracket to mount the camera to and it works great. We just wanted something to capture our leisure paddle down the river. By no means is it super high quality, however it's great to share with family...also great for Youtube videos. I do wish you could use a larger capacity card, and the battery life could be a little better, however overall I'm super happy with it.One thing I should note is that the audio is virtually worthless. Our camera captures virtually no sounds. We had no intentions to use the sound so it's not a big deal for us...if I remember, I disable the sound thinking I may get a little more battery life. We're heading to Hawaii in a few weeks and can't wait to try it out there!When we bought it (September 2009), it was $50....definitely worth this price! I dunno if I would've pulled the trigger if was the $70 it's currently listed as, however I would've been equally happy if I would've."
500674,0,This is my second Tag Heuer purchase. With my first watch I was impressed with the quality and accuracy of the watch so when I was looking for a sports watch Tag Heuer was on the top of my list. I purchased the Tag Heuer Men's Formula 1 F1 sports watch. I have had it for about two months and the watch is high quality for accuracy but there are some draw backs. Time is hard to tell in low light or bright sunlight. The watch face is white and the numbers are silver. It is impossible to read at night. The illumination is poor. The watch is good looking and is accurate that is why I gave it three stars.
387155,0,"I use this for barbell hip thrusts. It does the job and hasn't smooshed down or deformed at all. Nice nylon material, strong stitching.It does not stay closed over a standard-issue barbell. The velco is too weak, and the pad is a bit tight. It gets instantly pulled open when it makes contact with your body. But all you need to do is make sure the area with the pad closure is rotated away from where the bar contacts your body. It's a bit of a nuisance, but it was worth it to me to save money."
37539,0,"This vest was so thin that by holding it up to the light you could see through it. A large size which I usually wear was way to big--should have gotten a medium. Rather than returning it, I gave it to a friend who likes it and wears it all the time. I ended up buying a Lands End Polartec vest which I like a lot better than the Columbia."
218011,2,"By all accounts, this system looked like a good compromise between much pricier alternatives and cheaper, smaller, and more rickety-looking models available. Assembly was not too difficult, directions were fine. However, my unit came with a molded plastic base that does not hold water. Contacting the manufacturer revealed that the consumer product hotline provided connects you to an unrelated manufacturing company (whose folks were very understandable, noting that they get lots of calls about Spalding products). Scouring the Spalding website eventually revealed a valid number, which resulted in having to call a separate parts department, and after enjoying long spells of music on hold (in both cases), I was told that the offending part was out of stock and would be available in three months or so. Alternatively, I could disassemble the unit and have it replaced (which, of course, is not a real option - if you put the unit together as directed, once the unit is assembled, I dare anyone to take the three main pole units apart).Overall, I cannot recommend this unit to any sane person, though of course if I had used sand instead of water for ballast, I suppose I would never have had this problem!"
184109,0,This is a perfect gentlemans knife. Nice size and features. Good blade that holds and edge and no play in the blade at all. The only problem is it is hard to open using the thumb stud. I've had it a couple of days and when I first got it I could open it with the thumb stud but now my thumb is so sore there is no way. I don't know if it will get better as time goes by but this thing is a challenge to open one handed.
455971,0,"A little disappointed because the reviews that I read said this would be perfect size for my daughters age...but nothing was mentioned about the child's weight.

No quality control or true warranty from manufacturer (Dewey USA) who to my surprise was quite nasty about giving me a refund. Upon returning set, I had to pay all shipping costs. I lost $75.00, made a lowsy gift and made a fool of myself. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!"

120722,0,"The holster is very nice looking, materials are nice but it is extremely bulky so in reality as a day to day holster is not really an option.I bought another holster as well , a Galco one for my daily use and will keep this one for the shooting range."
210191,2,"I bought this off the ""deals"" pricing. This holster fits the gun OK but it is a left hand, not right hand holster. Looks like someone put in back in stock and did not understand it was left hand. I kept the holster because it fits my gun."
52101,1,"Not meant for large hands.My hands are small but, even I find it a little clumsy.It's quite tiny. It's best feature has to be the safety mechanism.This mechanism must be initiated before pushing on the thumb stud. I like it because I prefer to keep my knife clipped to the inside of my waist band. And the safety keeps the blade from being accidentally propelled open in your pants. Though, it is ambidextorious, it is easier for me to use my right hand, and takes some doing with the left. I'm not to impressed with the plastic handle, but as a person who has also taken apart my knife to examine the internals, I can tell you, it's solid construction. You won't be breaking this knife any-time soon.(There is a spring inside the handle that propels the blade out after you press on the stud.)The Flash II is exactly the same as the Flash I, only larger. Better for bigger hands.However, it's not better than a Kershaw knife,( ""Tactical Blur"")The Kershaw's handle is more solidly made and it has a bar instead of a spring. The Kershaw bar propells the blade lightening fast. But injury is a big concern. The Flash though not as quick as the Kershaw, has the safety. Which makes a safer knife than the Kershaw.I give the Flash I, Four stars: for....1. Solid Blade construction.2. Safety mechanism.3. Discrete carry pocket clip.4. Ease of use.It doesn't get a fifth star because there is no blunt end at the base of the blade to keep your thumb from scraping the edge when you open it.And for the plastic handle as well, and no brass bushings on the inside wear blade meets handle.(Sorry for spelling errors, to lazy to get 10 pound dictionary out)"
429585,1,I was a little concerned that the good reviews were not accurate but they are. It was super easy to assemble and is durable. It folds up nicely and I am happy with my purchase.
215519,0,"When these breeches arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the fit was pretty good. I'm only 4'11"" and the 28's weren't too long and didn't bag too much in the knees (common when you're shorter with breeches!). However, after riding in them a bit, I wish they had a bit more give in the fabric to conform to my body. Once on my horse, I had to really pull on them to adjust the legs upward for a comfortable ride. I just didn't get enough give in the crotch to make them comfy enough, though I think they fit well when standing! Perhaps I just need to break these in more, but I'll have to wait for the cool weather as the synthetic full seat is also a bit sweat inducing. Granted I rode in an indoor arena, when it was probably over 85, but I don't have as much of a pooling sweat issue in my seat when I wear a cotton breech. I think with a bit more riding time in these and cooler weather, they'll be good though. They seem extremely well made so could stand up to some washing for a more worn feel. Then, these will probably be among my favorites for cool weather riding!"

82868,1,"I love this jacket and get tons of compliments. While it looks like it would be heavy and bulky, it's the true opposite. It's good for cooler nights (down to about 50 degrees), but acts as a good liner under a coat or shell for cooler weather. I'd say it's not as warm as I expected, but because it is thin, it works well under even my tighter coats. It's been great for travel, since it's so lightweight. Definitely more flattering than a bulky sweatshirt."

We went for a replacement rather than a refund thinking that we got a dud. The new lantern arrived in no time, but it too did not work! If it hadn't been that 1 of the original 2 lanterns worked I would have blamed something that we were doing or not doing--but having 1 that worked we realized that either the lantern was defective from birth or suffered harm during the delivery. This time we went for a refund, not wanting to take another chance on getting another inoperable lantern. Too bad because the lantern is great (when it works)--it was just too much trouble for us to get 2 working lanterns so we had to give up with 1 working lantern."

103734,0,"I do not like this holster. I'm returning it to Amazon.The belt loop is plastic as shown in Mary J. Toth's picture. This makes it difficult to slip on a belt. (I tried it on a 1.25"" harness leather belt.) This holster rides high. I bought this for a Ruger Old Army which has a 7.5 inch barrel. It's difficult to draw and to reinsert the revolver back in the holster.There is no strap adjustment tool and the holster does not have a thumb break. For those with smaller handguns, this holster cannot be worn inside the waistband as stated in the description.Other than that the holster is well made."

When I first bought it, it was snug but after an hour long training session it became loose and started to shift around. I would consider purchasing a different knee pad since the quality of this one is pretty poor. If the manufacturer's fixed this issue I'd be more than willing to purchase it again though."
154848,0,This pump does not really blow out a lot of air. This will work for emergencies but i wouldn't use it for an everyday pump. Quality is okay and it fit on my bike fairly easily. Takes up minimal space.

499920,0,"Let me start out and say unless you have to buy it from amazon don't because i bought mine for about 3.50 bucks. What they sell it here for is way to expensive for only an ok set of silverware. Overall If i had to choose I would most likely buy this set again for about 4 bucks but there are some flaws in this set.What I like about this set is:It has an EPIC spoon; this is one of the best spoons I have used very good for soup or anything else because its very wide.I like that it all fits together on the forkWhat I dont likeThe knife if good but needs some sharpening. I sharpened it with my dremelThe fork is useless. Even though it has prongs on it like a normal for they are not spaced far apart. So again my dremel did the handy work and i sharpened the point and cut part of the metal down so it could actually be usefulIf your a backpacker I wouldn't recommend this because its very heavy but its very very sturdy.Even though they connect together they don't stay together, I drilled a hole at the end of all of them and put a clip ring on them so they would stay together.As I said earlier I wouldn't recommend for a backpacker even though that's what i'm using it for because im too cheap to spend 10 bucks on a spoon for titanium and 15 on the other utensils.I would recommend this for all around use though even if it is just basic camping"

484141,0,"The original Core Stretch had foam cushions on the bottom that were uncovered with bit of texture so when you tucked it in your waist it stayed put. The new ones, the foam rollers are covered with vinyl and when stretching, slips out from your waist. It's very frustrating and a poor upgrade. I haven't looked in to what would be under the vinyl should it be removed as this new one was a gift, but my recommendation is you check yourself or add tennis grip or something to the rollers to aid in their staying put. Other then that, it does indeed help with stretching and is a good product for seniors with arthritis or for people who need to sit in a chair to do their stretching."

We will update our review if we recieve the items requested. We can not test the bike until we at least recieve the pedals. We do not want to return the bike as we am definitely afraid of the shipping costs!!Update as of 12/4/2008: I did recieve some pedals through Kent Bikes.Com. It took a while but they did ship them out to us. They did not hear our request about the outher items such as the reflectors and other items listed above but we do like the bike and ride it often."
294077,0,"I bought this to use in my motorcycle,mounts very easy,but the backplate doesnt have any type of cushion for the batteries,so if you have it on and it a bump it causes the gps to go off,then it takes a while for the gps to callibrate,and just when it starts working good,bump.I cut small peices of foam and inserted between the batteries and the back and it helps the problem alot."
35839,1,"Good, not too pricey gloves for the martial artist who is interested in a good price. I have had mine for about 8 months and the stitching is holding up fine, wrist support is good, and fit is adjustable."
337335,2,"I find it amazing that this pedometer does not allow you to simply reset your data (i.e. steps, miles walked, etc.) to zero with the simple press of a button. The only way to get a ""fresh start"" at ""zero"" during the day is to either set the clock to 11:59 p.m. and ""trick"" the unit into thinking it is midnight at which time it resets your miles walked and steps taken to zero. Or you can ""Reset"" the entire unit which means you have to go through the entire set up process (i.e. time, stride length, weight, etc.) all over again.Absolutely stupid you can't simply ""reset"" with the push of a button.Looking for a new pedometer now."

245565,1,It's a nice quality shirt. I use it for running and so far it hasn't fallen apart. Purchased Dec 2012
349736,0,"These bars do help alleviate joint pain when doing pushups, but the foam grip that you see in the picture is a loose covering and slip much too easily when doing pushups. You get what you pay for.My suggestion, pay double the price, and you should get something with a little more quality."
403326,0,"This is my first time reviewing a product. We live on a lake and have had multiple tubes. We took this one out for the first time today and the first ride was set for a slow cruiser with a 3 year old and 6 year old. When going slow, this tube totally dives, which knocked both kids off right away and neither wanted to ride again. Then we put the 13 year olds on it and it works great. If the riders are older and can keep their weight back to start, it's really fun. It goes fast, catches good air, and is easy to hold on to. But going slow is not an option, and is actually pretty dangerous for younger riders that can't keep their weight back.Bottom line, if your riders are older this is a great tube. If it's going to be used for little kids or for slow cruising, it is not a good tube."
323703,0,"Good looking watch; rating it lower than ""5"" due to uncomfortable band!It never feels right on your arm..."
26676,0,"This net is OK for recreational use, but isn't as good as the Typhoon Net or Hurricane Net. The net is not very sturdy and is difficult to use in windy conditions. Also, the telescoping poles can bend easily and become damaged."
466864,0,"The airzooka is a neat idea: a wastebasket-sized cylinder with a strong bag inside held taught by a heavy rubber band. Pull the bag back, and it snaps forward quickly, making an invisible 'puff' of air that can easily travel 15 feet.It's a cool effect, and a lot of fun. You can actually knock down very light things from across the room, blow a person's air, and make a strong enough breeze for them that they blink in surprise.On the down side, it takes some real muscle to put this thing together so it doesn't collapse after use: it has three different rings mounted inside each other you need to snap into place. And, it looks like a trash can with a plastic bag, inviting abuse. My son played with it by shoving things into it, pulling part of the bag off the rim, thus breaking it.Pro:+ Interesting idea, works great as long as you can get it put together right+ Fun and harmlessCon:- Hard to assemble correctly. Definitely takes an adult, preferably a strong one.- Not durable. I've had two of these, both broke by the bag coming unstuck from the rim, keeping it from moving as much air.- Bulky. Takes up a lot of space wherever you store it.It's OK to buy one of these if you're an adult I'd say, but if it's for a kid, expect it not to last too long."
75604,1,Can't go wrong with Russell products - for comfort and long lasting quality -
242506,0,"The material is a little scratchy and lighter weight than I expected, but all in all this is a good product at the price. I will say they don't seem to stretch out of shape as fast as other brands.If you are looking for higher quality (and price) get the Champion version."
200145,1,I purchased this product as a present for my son's friend and he loved it.
342443,0,"The problem with these is that the liner inside fits in a way that the crotch of the exterior of the shorts rides really low, and creates an unattractive pouch in the front, like you are hiding some kind of accident in your pants. I don't know about you, but when I spend money on workout clothes, I expect them to be functional, but I don't think it's too much to expect them not to look weird. Other than this, the quality of the materials is great, so if you by chance have a body type that can wear these a bit better, I would recommend trying them on in the store first to make sure, which unfortunately kind of defeats the convenience of online shopping."
167041,0,"I bought two of these over four years ago. The steps are hollow, so I was concerned about it standing up to my weight (I weighed 265lbs. at the time). Not only did they stand up to the rigors of a step routine, but I used them as a makeshift bench for all types of strength exercises. Amazingly they don't give despite they're being hollow; the plastic they're made from is quite strong. The size is good for solid footing, and while they're a little bulky, they're very lightweight, thus easily transportable from room to room.That said, There are some issues:1) They occassionally slip off one another during a particularly rigorous and fast-paced aerobic routine (that's no surprise, given that you're essentially stacking two smooth pieces of plastic).2) The top is stubbled for adequate traction and footing, but heaven help you if a considerable amount of sweat gets on them: it's like stepping on ice.3) The bottoms have tiny rubber pads on them, which does not help with keeping the step from sliding around the floor, especially a smooth floor.Once I resolved those issues, they were wonderful. As for price, I paid $20 each for them, so this price is a little high for my taste (I don't remember the company I got them from). That's why I give it 3 out of 5 stars instead of one or two stars."
442700,1,boots were as expected and I would purchase again. They were promptly shipped and arrived timely. no complaints from me on these boots.
256585,2,"I ordered this Oriole's jersey, and they shipped me a Brewer's jersey. I contacted Amazon, and they said they would ship me the correct item. Yesterday I got a SECOND Brewer's jersey in the mail. Now they are offering a refund, and will not correct the order."
134532,2,"Amazon item description states this item is a DIGITAL SCALE!! IT IS NOT!!! It is only a device to hold fish and to measure length NOT WEIGHT, though the item description states ""Digital scale weighs lbs and oz, or kilograms."" Very unhappy :( RETURNING ITEM FOR REFUND!!!"
54567,1,"I bought this helmet as a gift for my daughter. She hasn't worn it yet much due to the ice and snow, but it's true to the photo... a cute metallic pink, good fit."
256647,0,"I purchased for a ""just in case"" fix to mount my PakRak if the standard hardware would not work. the hardware arived in good condition, and if the original piece loosens or doesnt hold i have a backup."
510987,2,"This light looks nice but it doesn't stay put. This light moves horizontal and vertically while you are riding. Yes, I got it tight but it still moves around and you have to keep re-aligning it while riding."
37738,0,"Columbia Sportswear Men's Cathedral Peak Vest. I ordered two of these, one grey and one Tusk color. I really like the Tusk. These run a little bit small and should have just a bit more length to them. I'm 6'3"" tall and normally an extra large works fine for me, but not in this vest. I would have ordered an extra large Tall, but they don't come in the Tall size.I really like the fleece feel and the two outside zipper pocket, but it would be nice if they had an inside pocket, like Columbia puts on the inside of their Cougar Peaks outerwear."
500116,1,"Bought my first ASP light (white light, not Elite) about five years ago; I use it regularly (several times a week) and it still works like new with the original battery. I've given about a dozen (both blue and white lights) as gifts and the recipients have all raved about how much they like the lights and how often they use them. The blue lights aren't as bright as the white, but are useful when you don't want the light to be too obvious (as in a theatre) or when you're working in night conditions and don't want the brighter light to dim your vision (star gazing). When I discovered the Elite, I HAD to have one, and it's worked as well and as reliably as the others. The ""stay-on"" option of the Elite is especially useful when you need to use both hands. The emergency flash is a nice extra, but I'm grateful that I haven't needed it. This is my second ""Elite"" purchase -- for the car glovebox."
428995,0,"These lugs crimp okay but no better than others and are not 100%. I had to crimp using the proper tool several times on one of the lugs out of four in order to get it to hold sufficiently.

32926,0,I am a 23 year old army veteran living in Saint Louis MO looking for a 3 person or more team to battle. Since I got back from Iraq and got out of the army 3 months ago I have been looking for a good team to battle. My 3 teammates and I are only interested in SERIOUS gamers that want to battle for real. NO KIDS!!! 18 and older please. We can battle for money or just bragging rights. We only battle in the woods 2 or 3 square mile radious boundry. ALL airsoft weapons allowed. Both team captains agree on the terms and no refs. This is real battle and we treat it as such!!!
141448,1,"I brought this grip because I wanted to improve the feel of my Ruger LCP. I went to the range and shot about 150 rounds through the gun before having this grip on. My hand was sore and bruised. With the grip on, the difference is very noticeable. It's more comfortable, the guns fits better in my hand.I recommend this grip to anyone with a Ruger LCP. You have to so some trimming of the grip since it's universal. But after the trimming, it fits great and works wonderfully."
267952,2,"I have to agree that the mirror 'arm' is too short.However, my helmet is one of the larger made.(Bell Faction Dave Mirra Multi-Sport)I also think I should have purchased a mirror with a larger diameter.Since the mirror arm and mount adjustment socket-balls have sucha limited range of movement, I had a very limited choice in wherethe mirror base (double-sided-sticky) could be installed.I have to look way up and left to see the mirror, andthat might take a lot of getting used to.Had I been able to mount it lower, it would be easierto use (without rolling my eyes so far over).While out riding today, I found that the mirror can be removedfrom it's base. Built into the flat mounting section, thereare two little 'snaps' that hold two segments together.While I was reaching up trying to adjust my view,the whole thing popped off in my hand.I snapped it back on later when we stopped for ice cream. :)There is much more vibration ( = fuzzy vision) thanis seen in my handlebar mounted (Blackburn) mirror.If you ride on bumpy roads a lot, forget this mirror!If I get another one, It will be bigger and have a longer arm."

510392,1,"like the tittle said, this is the best air bed I've bought and its still ticking. I've had it for a bout a year now and believe me, i put it through some abuse, but it still manages to surprise me by staying inflated.Here is a tip, if you don't want it to deflate on you during the night, do not take off the main valve to deflate the bed, if you take it on and off it will not fall into place correctly causing the valve not to seal properly, just unplug the small nozzle, then twist off the small wheel and release the air in that manner.if you don't want to wait around, just plug the valve with a q-tip and let it deflate on its own. if you do this i a sure you, it will not deflate. unless there is some other problem with the mattress."
495850,1,The videos are true to their advertisements. Great exercises that really give you a workout but don't leave you drained and too sore to move the next day. You really do get fast results that last!
207526,1,This is an awesome filter. It works smoothly and I absolutely love its ruggedness. I have a pet peeve about how there is only junk available to us these days. It is nice to see a company put out a good product that will last for years.
2421,0,"This ball popped suddenly within two months of purchase. I made sure to inflate it correctly, so it was a disappointment when we could no longer use it. It seemed good until then."
436144,0,"I had to use a 1 3/4 inch block of wood secured with two small nuts and bolts to raise my straight (non angled)Leica scope high enough to meet the camera lens even when the camera is set at its lowest adjustment point. This device was apparently designed for angled scopes which I consider very odd. Also, the shoe plates have to be extremely tight -- to the point where you might damage the threads -- to prevent the scope from turning and thus misaligning when bumped or carried. Otherwise, it is very well constructed and works very well -- after it is re-engineered to work with a straight scope. The quality of the photos shot through the scope with my Canon Powershot S100 (an absolutely marvelous compact camera) is excellent. They are comparable to photos taken with a good DSLR with a 700+ mm lens. Bill Jones"
225022,0,"This watch looks pretty classy, but the quality is a little cheesy. The clasp is a little rickety, and the numbers are a little hard to read for the ""seeing impaired"". But, for the money, its a pretty good deal. Not disappointed that I bought it. Might not have if I had seen it in the store first."
283732,0,"Once I had an Eureka tent before and it was a great product. That's why I decide to purchase this item. However, I am dissapointed to realize that this tent is not propperly impermeable. On my first camping I experienced some rain and some water indeed got inside. I recommend this tent only if you prentend to camp on very mild weathers with very little rain."
269585,2,I found that this product looks easy to use but is HARD. I would not buy one!!!!!!!! Does not work like they show. very dissapointed!!!
56845,0,"I got these for my wife and small is extremely small, more like fitting the hand of a ten year old girl, don't get the small unless you have super tiny hands, also product not as pictures as usually all these everlast products are, received the model with the crisscross x straps."
38931,0,"Pros:- swords themselves are well made, smooth and balanced- good quality wood- very cheapCons:- plastic grip guard doesn't stay in place; the little plastic ring that separates the division between the grip and the sword comes loose and continually has to be pushed into place; the notch into which the guard is supposed to fit isn't straight so even if it could stay in place it wouldn't be level;"
400468,1,"I use it on our mountain bikes, mortocycle and car tires.Works well and fast to adjust tire pressure.Bit noisy but other than that very satisfied.Recommended."
264897,0,I was unable to use this because I needed a 36 spoke wheel. This one only has 32 spokes. My application was for motorized bicycles. 38 spoke wheels are needed for rear sprocket adapters.
422966,0,"I ride this bike once or twice a week for for about ten miles along the seawall. I do not think it would hold up well if I rode it with any greater frequency. Around town the six speed gearing is enough. The brake are great, the crank arms feel flimsy to me. If I wasn't so cheap, I'd get rid of the neither fish nor foul road+knobby tires. I'm slightly cramped by the handle bars, so over six feet should perhaps look elsewhere."
332475,0,"made out of pine...price is right, but shipping is a little out to lunch.. it is a good template to make a rack out of fancy wood, though.."
398642,0,"Purchased the Schwinn 418 after reading several favorable reviews and not seeing any negative comments. After using it for 2 weeks it developed an annoying squeal in the pedal cranks. I disassembled them and greased them using wheel bearing grease and within a few minutes of use again, started squealing. I called Schwinn, got voice prompts and ultimately a voice mail, left message, also sent e-mail asking if this has been an issue, if so, do they have a fix for it. 4 days have passed and they still have not responded.I like the design and the computerized programs, makes it fun to use after having a manual elliptical for many years. Overall, I think it is a good product, if only we could get it to stop squealing."
8441,2,"I mounted this mirror on my bike, and THE NEXT DAY I accidentally tipped my bike over on the side that the mirror was mounted on, and the mirror hit the ground. Luckily for me, the mirror is made out of glass and it shattered on impact. I guess this product is too cheap to be made with any type of shock-proof material. Oh well, $15 lost and a lesson learned."
454475,0,Basically a heart rate monitor should do just that and that s what the Omron HR 100C does. No need for other models which in some cases cost ten times what this machine costs. The only draw back Is that you have to wear the watch on your wrist and cannot rely on your treadmill to pick up the signal from the belt as it seems to be further than the recommend range.
308840,1,"i've been a coleman user since 2005, its mattresses are spectacular, and its quality is awesome, but in this specific case, be aware of the electric 4d pump that comes in the package. it just sucks, its inflate power is so poor, just enough to half inflate the mattress. so its better to buy the mattress alone, and buy a separate real pump, otherwise you will be disappointed in a camp in the middle of nowhere sleeping in a half inflated mattress"
281434,1,Excellent service and a great watch. Hard to find a better automatic watch for the price.
170551,0,"Pros: Cheap! Holds 3 bikes, but more like 2 on my 2000 Sentra w/ spoiler. Fits over most car spoilers. Folds and is easy to store.Cons: The six straps are a pain to adjust. Bottom support rests on my license plate. Bike hold downs move around.I bought this because it was the cheapest three bike trunk rack I could find. Over all, I'm happy. Unfortunately, like another reviewer here, the straps kept coming loose, even after I did as the manual said and tie things off in knots. This is most likely due to the foam compressing under load or the knots tightening and creating slack.After a trip to REI, I fit two triglide rings to each of the top straps and one of the side straps. After adjusted to my car's trunk, I looped the straps through each triglide buckle twice. So that's three layers of webbing in each buckle. This also means I looped the webbing through the hooks, and the ladder locks bolted to the rack. The result is nice, dense, non adjusting, triple 1"" webbing straps. This also means that I now have 3 straps less to worry about. I added two triglide buckle to each of the remaining three straps. Unlike the other straps, I didn't go through the triglides twice. Spacing them widely apart and going through them just once keeps the straps snug and secure, though a bit of a pain to adjust. If I had to do it again, I'd probably buy six or three 1"" ratcheting or metal cam buckle straps. This of course would put me close to the price range of higher end racks. But for a few dollars, triglides can do the job. It also looks very tidy as there are no extra bits flapping in the wind.Sadly, on my car, the bottom foam bar rests directly on my license plate. So it is slowly rubbing the paint away underneath it. A total bummer. I plan on adding a closed cell foam pad underneath it to put that to an end.The bike hold downs do move about. Once I figure out what the best distances are for our bikes, a few inches of PVC pipe and or zip ties are probably in my future. I also picked up some 60"" side release buckle straps to loop through the bike wheels to prevent spinning. A small patch of grip tape to the bottom support tube prevents scratching from chain rings and denting of seat tubes.In the end, it's three stars. It's the little things that make a rack easy to use. This one lacks very much so the little things. But, a little thought and very inexpensive bits will make things right for existing owners. For the tinkerers, here's your canvas. :)"
146972,0,"Its pretty much what you see is what you get, but for someone particular like me there were two things that stood out to me. First off I use this for my runs and kayaking. The thing I like is that there is a small zipper pocket on the back of the hydration pack. I love this spot for my keys, my last pack did not have one. The thing that I dislike is that there is no chest strap. I have a broad chest so I find the straps slide off my shoulders. My last pack had a chest strap and the pack did not move at all. And lastly, there is no clip or anything for the mouth piece, so It just dangles and I have to tuck it under the strap to keep it from getting in the way."
307362,2,"The ball came in soft and i bought a pump to inflate it. It wouldnt inflate as a seam was broken I received a credit for the price of the ball,But lt cost me $6 bucks because I did not get credit for the shipping. A real bummer!!! I was told that I would get full credit by AMAZON customer service, bt that was not the case. They lost a customer for 6 bucks, what a joke..."
58167,0,"Bought 3 of these for my young children because they are advertised as 4'6"" long.

263426,0,The watch is beautiful. It looks LIKE my REAL Rolex which was stolen from me a while back and is being held as evidence. However the Invicta LOSES FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR PER DAY??? So I plan to stop using it. Who wants a watch that's always slow an hour or so???
502203,2,"I ordered this clock on the 21st of Dec, prior to Christmas, and paid for 3 day shipping. The ad said order by this date to get your product before Christmas. Well, when I got my confirmation email it said ""Shipping Method: Expedited"" then it said ""Delivery estimate: Dec. 29, 2011 - Jan. 4, 2012"" conveniently stated so that the product will arrive ""on-time"" but nowhere near ""3-day"" or ""expedited"". So when the clock made it to our house on the 3rd of Jan. the box looked beat up, the packing was loose, the cheap box on the INSIDE was not taped shut, there wasn't any kind of packing slip, no directions for the clock.... very unprofessional. So I opened the INSIDE box to find that the hands on the clock were loose, the clock was scratched, the clock did not fit it's housing, and the screws on the back were stripped out and rusted. Now this was just the beginning. I called to ""FansEdge"" to complain and they asked me to get the order number off the packing slip that should be on the inside of the box, keep in mind that there wasn't any kind of paperwork inside the box at all. FansEdge told me that they ""Sub-contracted"" these orders, not sure from where. Now they refunded my money but they told me that UPS would contact me and send a ""return slip"". UPS contacted me by email but never sent a return slip. After calling back to FansEdge several times and multiple emails I was left with a clock that I have bought better quality products at the dollar store and yes, I tried to put a battery into the piece of junk.... and surprise, surprise, it does not work. I am very disappointed with the way this was handled from beginning to end. Not professional at all!"
434417,0,"The unit is certainly a great solid piece of equipment...but if you're interested on buying it, this is what you should know:The Aluminum Pulley kit that is displayed on these pictures are not included on none of those price tags...according to Body Solid and other resellers that aluminum kit is an upgrade that you have to buy if you want a much smoother workout, which I found incredibly disappointing to find out right after I bought it.This is not Amazon's fault, and it's certainly false advertisement, I spoke with both the reseller and Body Solid, and as of now Im still waiting on a resolution from both of them.I will update this post as soon as I get a resolution on this matter through Body Solid.For those thinking of buying it, I wouldn't recommend using this product with the pulley kit that come from stock, they're not that great, and according to other reviews online they say the aluminum kit is the way to go.UPDATE: They did resolve my case, but it wasn't easy at all. Contact the seller before you buy!"

12170,2,The vest did not meet my expectations. The quality of the fleece was not what I expected. I expected a thicker fleece. It is very hard buying some things online without details of the construction of the item. Thanks Scott
406547,0,"Yes, these are comfortable pants. The elastic waist does add to the comfort by stretching when you're active. The cotton canvas material breathes well for summer wear and also insulates pretty good for colder weather. The pants are cut roomy, have double material in the seat and knees. The rear pockets are large and the number of patch pockets allow you to carry a lot of stuff. But these pants share the one major downside of the Royal Robbins Billy Goat pants from which they are derived. They shrink. Mostly in the length but also some in the waist as well. And they continue to shrink over time. They seem to come a little oversized when new to help make up for this shrinkage but the sizing is not really consistent which leads to differences in fit over time. I have some 5.11 pants that still fit me well in both the waist and inseam, some that are now ""high water"" pants that look goofy since they hit me above my ankles and some that are now too tight in the waist. All of them started out the same size. Since cotton does stretch with wear, those that are only a little tight in the waist are still wearable but not as comfortable as they started out even considering the elastic waist band. I was originally very impressed with 5.11 pants, so much so that I bought several pair in various colors. Now I have an assortment of pants in various stages of fit. Take it from someone with experience, wash these things in cold water and dry them without any heat. Even taking these precautions, I still had shrinkage problems.As an alternative to the 5.11 tac pants, I've found Tru-Spec 24/7 in ripstop poly/cotton to be an excellent choice. The Tru-Spec pants are comfortable year-round despite being mostly polyester, they handle hard use extremely well, they have roomier (and more) pockets with some of the strongest Velcro ever made and they don't shrink even a fraction of an inch despite many washes. The only downside to the poly/cotton Tru-Specs would be for those who might be in proximity to open flames and burning embers due to the polyester content--be careful around a crackling campfire."

191504,0,I liked the backpack and how it looked. I read a revieve and they said they couldn't get there sleeping bag in the bag compartment at the bottom and I thought they must just have a much bigger bag that not all that suitable for back packing. Found out they were right. I did Find a way i'm kinda suborn i was bound to get in in there. I went through the top unzipped the bottom and pushed like heck to get it down there. I got it done but cant zip the bottom back up. The sleeping bag now goes in the main compartment and use the bottom for clothes and what not....other then that .......good bag
67728,0,"Although I am accustomed to sharper swords, this serves well enough if you need something to intimidate those who threaten you. I would not trust it to perform too magnificently in actual combat, though it is more of a show sword."
148418,1,"I got this item for my kids for Christmas. Make sure you already have a pump ready to inflate it since it comes deflated. It also has a sticker on the side of the box that states to ""open immediately and inspect it for damage. Claims must be filed within 10 days."" I looked it over and it seems in good condition.

51838,0,"If you're a big college football fan, then I think you should definitly buy this game. It's got the college atmosphere in each big time stadium. The atmosphere isn't as good in the littler schools such as Idaho. In fact, the game doesn't even have Idaho's real stadium. Same goes for a lot of the stadiums. I'm also very dissapointed that there are no Division 1-AA schools. I really enjoyed having them at my disposel. EA just keeps getting more and more dissapointing."

78212,0,"I got this bike as I wanted to do a sprint triathlon this past summer. I am a swimmer/runner and hadn't really ridden a bike since jr. high. I didn't want to invest thousands of dollars into a bike if I wasn't even sure if this was something I wanted to continue with in the future. To just go out and ride 20 miles or so on a Saturday afternoon, this bike definitely does the job. As a racing bike I was at a serious disadvantage though. I'll probably do another tri or 2 next summer with this bike, however after that if I decide to stick with it I will definitely upgrade. Glad I made the purchase though and I do think it was worth the money."

465994,0,"This item is inexpensive because it isn't as good as the ones that cost 2 to 10 times as much. But it still works. It's light weight and seems rugged. It came with a hard case that was way better than what I expected, and a soft case that is nice too. The little tripod is cheep but works. I like it just fine."

25383,0,The mattress is convenient because it's easy to store but as far as comfort it's not so great. Really hard to lay on. We put 2 foam things on top of it and it's tolerable. Overall it's an ok product.
461385,1,Low cost makes this a good set for beginners. The plastic does chip when the discs hit trees and concrete.
350148,1,"I bought this watch 2 years ago and after abusing it non stop it still looks as good as when I first put it on. To dress it up, I bought the steel bracelet which isn't great but does the job. I prefer now to keep it with the original rubber bracelet. I got it for about $400 but even at $600 it is still the best swiss automatic you can buy. Your next watch after this would have to be an Omega or Rolex--Anything else would be a lateral move. Buy this Tank of a watch--you won't regret it."
68858,1,"I use these to wear around th house. I wouldn't go out in public with them. I only paid $11 for a pair. I'm very short, so when capris go on sale I buy them. These are not stylish (you can tell from the photo), but they are comfortable for me. I haven't had a problem with the ""hanging crotch"" so my body build must be different from other reviewers'. They wash easily. The drawstring hasn't given me any trouble with coming loose in the washing machine. I really don't like drawstring pants that have loose strings. So I like these and will watch to see if and when they go on sale again. Mine are in navy and they haven't faded."

133252,1,"We purchased five of the Silva Starter 1-2-3 Compasses for an orienteering course that we run with 5th graders who have the attention span of a block of wood. The compasses are easy to use, accurate, and durable. After each event, we line them up to see if they all read the same and they always so do. It would have been nice for Silva to include a simple lanyard. Make sure you look at all of your buying options; Go2 Outfitters charges over $2 more than a direct from Amazon purchase."
368643,0,"I bought this to keep my kid warm in an outdoor pool in Orlando in February. It bought us about and extra 10 minutes of swim time before he turned into a total popsicle, but that was it. The water was heated to 72, and the air was 70. I really didn't think I was asking too much, but apparently I was... I think I needed something thicker and I KNOW I needed something with insulated arms - preferably long sleeves (this item has spandex sleeves and that's it)."
120091,0,"I bought this watch in Dec 2008. For 3 1/2 years it ran great, but once the battery died, I couldn't get it started after replacing the battery. The watch has been through all kinds of different weather elements, since I live and work in Dutch Harbor, AK. I would not recommend this watch for long terms use."
375188,1,"These bottles are of high quality and don't leak when using the solid caps. After owning some for years, I recently bought more for a long trip.Four stars because the small bottles are just 2 ounces, so you don't get the full benefit of a 3 ounce carry-on bottle. It would be nice to be able to purchase a bunch of 3 ounce bottles..."
22950,2,The hat was suppose to be an XL size yet it wouldn't even fit my friends head who normally wears a Medium. All of this after having to wait almost 3 weeks for it to deliver. Very disappointing.
389447,0,Good quality line but didn't like fishing it in a strong current. Braid is better for what I do. I gave this a shot on someone else's suggestion. I could see how some people like it.
243899,0,"This is a good product and I only wish it also came in a ""wicking"" or moisture moving weave/style. I always buy Russell if it is available."
342316,0,This is not an expensive seat therefore not high quality. It does look better than some I've seen in Sportman's Warehouse. Sits comfortable enough and feels like it will last awhile but just looks cheap.
360498,1,"One of my cohorts has this in their van, and I so badly want one for my own. It is so neat and does not get in the way.I have only experienced it when used to keep Pop, fruit and sandwiches cold. So much better than a regular cooler that require ice that melts and gets things wet and squishy. They have used it when taking a long drive to someones house and they are taking a warm dish, they said it is great for that too.I may break down soon and buy it. I live about an hour from my office and by the time I have gotten home with groceries they have gotten warm or are starting to melt/thaw. The markets are better on that side of the river, with this, I could do my shopping where I prefer and not worry about getting a speeding ticket racing home from the market.They always keep this in the back of the van out of the way, yet convenient to get to. It would fit so nicely in the back of the Cruiser."
151434,2,"The boots don't fit right. Not enough padding, and the latch is loose, even with extra padding. I don't recommend these boots. I have other Body Solid equipment, and their quality is excellent...not this time..."
243494,0,"The material is a little scratchy and lighter weight than I expected, but all in all this is a good product at the price. I will say they don't seem to stretch out of shape as fast as other brands.If you are looking for higher quality (and price) get the Champion version."
439828,0,The product is awesome! I just ordered the wrong size and now have to re-order and then I will be extremely pleased so check with me again!!
243663,0,I have always loved Russell shirts but my local store doesn't stock them any more. Ordered several online and was a little dissapointed. The fit was the same but not nearly as thick of a cotton as what I used to get. Delivery was quick though.
270,1,I love this bed. It stays firm and it is easy to pull into the livingroom to watch my big tv.It doesn't go flat like the other 2 I purchased at a Department store for $21.00. and booth of them have leaks in only 2 months. Ive had this bed (Intex) for 6 mo. now. I would advice everyone to get one
452989,0,"Good, not great. The waist band to waist band seam in the back is also the junction of the waist band to shorts seam. Result is 4X material thickness at these seams in this one location which is right over my sacrum. Not comfortable, digs in when laying on my back, especially when pressuring my sacrum with leg lifts. The shorts fit great, but the inner mesh support is tight for me. Maybe I a have a big a**; but hopefully my excess size is in the front. Shorts material is great and super flexible. Needs a pocket."
502444,0,"The poker and blackjack layouts are great, but the craps layout is very small. It would be hard to play with more than one or two people. There is no way that an on/off puck would actually work on it. I thought that the craps layout would be the full size of the table, not just the size of the inner layout for poker. I have to find another source for a craps layout for our casino party. That being said, the table is perfect for poker or blackjack. Given the price, I'm still happy I purchased it, just disappointed with the craps part."
219674,2,"I recently bought two pairs of these! I was very dissapointed when I received them and I saw they were not original Feiyue shoes, but replicas. They are very similar but the shape is very diferent. The originals are more pointy and these are rather round!I would have prefered to buy just one pair of original feiyue shoes than two replica pairs. I think AMAZON should be more careful on how they sell certain products. If not, in a couple of years you'll buy an Ipad through amazon and you'll get a chinese replica."
465435,0,"I bought this product because it looked a lot smaller than the other similar ab slide/roller/etc devices. I have one of the big, bulky blue ab devices and I love it. Those things have an internal spring that provides some resistance in the movement. Plus they have a much wider wheel base that makes them far more stable than this ab wheel. Overall, those isolate your abs much better and make the workout a lot easier on your arms and wrists than the ab wheel does. So you end up being able to do more reps to target your abs. So if you want a better ab workout, I'd go look at one of those. However, this ab wheel is MUCH smaller and therefore much more portable. I can disassemble it and easily fit it in a suitcase for traveling--which I do a lot. That way I can take it with me and not miss out on my daily ab workout. For that purpose, I love this thing. But because of its drawbacks, I have a feeling if I had ordered this thing as my first ab toy of this type I would have given up in frustration--its simply not sable enough to make this type of exercise comfortable for daily use."
55196,2,"I ordered over 30,000 bb's and none of them where like what the description said. Instead I ended up with 30,000 cheap yellow bbs that break in my AEG. My whole Airsoft team ordered some and all of them ended up with cheap bbs as well. Don't buy."
110535,1,I have been using this product for over a month now.It's been wonderfully simple to install and fun to use as long as you have a high enough doorway to set this up on.I like the fact that I don't have to drill any holes or anything to use this. That is what good design is all about!!
20489,1,"Represent your NFL team in style with this cute, sporty antenna ball! Excellent quality, very well made. I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy my lil guy is. We rocket down the highway everyday but I've never lost him! I would caution against rabid NFL fans; my sister had her Cowboys antenna ball ripped off and stomped flat by an angry Broncos fan! A small amount of rubber cement applied to the inside of the ball before affixing to the antenna will discourage theft! Cute way to represent your NFL team!"
13898,0,"I bought these socks through Amazon because I got Vibram fivefingers and couldn't find toesocks in any stores where I live (without socks I get blisters). They might seem a bit thick for some runners, but I like that. 'Small' fits my European size 36 feet well, but the toes are a bit too long and wide for me. The excessive fabric around the toes makes in somewhat difficult to put on the Vibram fivefingers, therefore only three stars. Still, I might have small toes, and if that is not your case, then these might be fine for you."
157432,0,This seat was a bit of a disappointment. It is much shorter than pictured and not nearly as comfortableas the seat that came on my AD4. I would not buy it again.
134062,1,So much easier then by hand!! Works great and is really handy and safer!! A must have for people who reload!!
273887,1,It is really cool fits snugly over my oversized driver. Got a lot of looks first time out on the golf course this year.
268637,1,I am female and pruchased this bike when I started trail riding. It is a bit heavy but I loved riding it. Good starter bike for the money. Would recommend it for beginners.
139187,0,"This set is okay if space and weight are not a concern. You can also buy these pieces separately at a camping store and some sporting goods stores. I recommend this because then you can select the pieces yourselves, and the quality is better this way. I find that these sets have lower quality."
234110,1,good timeing is what it is... buy it? cuz they did no lie to any one about it... 2 words
206925,0,"Like the beeswax, if these get too hot, they will make a mess. If you buy old ones, they probably won't smell.Stick with the paraffin. Buy it by the case.Otherwise, if you get a fresh batch (use your nose, it shouldn't smell like a crayon) and you watch it, these do stink it up pretty good. I wouldn't use it in the tent, but def in the rainfly/vesibule."

439315,1,I recently decided to purchase not one but pull golf cart for my brother whom i often golf with. I read most of the reviews and found this particular item by Tri Tech to have the most positive review. I recieved them within 5 days and they were very easy to assemble. They work great on the course with no problems. However the only downfall is the water bottle it comes with is very cheap and with the bracket that holds it in place does not allow to to interchange the bottle with one of your choice.
254042,1,Great Fitt and all I love it and Plan on buying more maybe It depends on how the weather will be

19677,0,"I bought this watch, my second Atomic Casio, because my first one was too big and because the cover came off one of the buttons surrounding the case, exposing the small plunger inside. The thin design of this one was an improvement, but now (only a few months after it went into service) the cover on one of its buttons has broken, too. So, I will not buy another Casio until this defect is remedied."
137771,0,"I am a huge collector of Pittsburgh Pirates hats. I have 17 different, and some how this is the one that I love the most. I wear my old one all the time, and I can't take it out in public... you know how it is with old hats.I can only rate this a 3 out of 5 though because this is the one hat that is impossible to be 100% happy with because in 20 years I've bought 6 of this hat alone (it's my favorite), and each has been a slightly different color, and that kind of frustrates me as to which is the TRUE color of the time. This one is Bright Yellow, I bought one that was much darker last time, and the one before that which I'm wearing now was somewhere in the middle. So it's by no means the dealer's issue. They did an amazing job, and it was one of the FASTEST deliveries I've ever had from Amazon, or eBay for that matter. I would happily buy from this vendor again. Especially if I can find the Yellow Pirates' Painter's cap with the black stripes. I have the black one, and they'd make a great pair."
435235,1,"I paid much more for this than a typical basketball but there's a huge difference. Great grip. Just looking at the ball, you can tell the difference."
271299,0,"Russell Athletic Long Sleeve Tees I purchased a few years ago were made of heavy (I mean heavy) material. This shirt, while nicely made, is not nearly as heavy, the most important characteristic that I wanted in my tee. The addition of a tasteful logo on the sleeve cuff is meant to compensate for the reduction in cotton fiber?"

500977,0,"The dimensions for this device are 3.5"" x 2.5"" x 6"" and the antenna telescopes out to 9"". I purchased this for the crank function which takes approx. 60 seconds for a full charge which lasts about 10 minutes (though the manual says 20 minutes.) The plastic used to construct this devices seems solid. The sound of the built in speaker/amplifier gets distorted after 1/4 turn of the knob but its loud enough at that setting.The reception is decent and since i only listen to one station the analog tuning doesn't bother me.It came with a little leash which seems perfect for strapping it on a belt.Its good for what i wanted it for, a walk around the block so i can listen to NPR..."
428601,2,"This is tricky. I shopped the various rearming kits for my Sospenders inflatable lifejacket, and ended up ordering two of these. They turned out to be the wrong size, and as I re-examine the details on the website I think the mistake was mine. Be sure to pay attention to the diameter of the threaded tip of the CO2 cartridge. Unfortunately, not returnable."
135127,0,"This product is alright, nothing special. I'd prefer an indented center to actually catch the punches with but these do the job. They feel kind of flimsy so I'm not sure if they'll last too long - but they work right now and are good for the price that I paid."
489582,2,"Assembly of the Airzooka is a major hassle and can be seriously frustrating. Poor product design.From the instructions one can surmise that the user will make the cone out of the three rings by use of a screw thread. The problem is that the thread is on the inside (not visible) and there are two sets of threads (one for each ring intersection) but only one place to hold on - this makes the system difficult to manipulate and impossible to visualize.If you go ""off-plan"" in the first steps of the instructions it is next to impossible to get back to the starting point: you are on your own to twist and pull, rotate backwards and push. My experience was that the device did not ""click"" as it should have and the rings got cross-threaded - I then spent the rest of the afternoon jamming it and pulling it until I had something that seemed solid and aligned (a big risk for $18)"
205677,0,"It's a pretty good jacket, but when I received it, it had a weird rubber tire smell. It took a couple of washes to get it out"
373496,0,"These targets are small than I expected. Not for use for any guns except BB guns and maybe a .22. The material they are made of is thicker than paper, which is good, but I had a hard time taping them to shoeboxes and cardboard to shoot at. Good for indoor close range shooting, but not functional outdoors."
331884,1,"fast delivery, price is great and item in very good condition"
149430,0,"When this knife arrived, I was initially surprised at how small it is, however after handling it a bit, it was comfortable to open and close one-handed. It's very sharp as expected for a Gerber product. My main disappointment came when I tried clipping it into my jeans pocket. The design of the clip and it's attachment to the handle, creates a ""bump"" under the clip that has to be gotten past for the clip to securely hold the knife in the pocket. I foresee this as a problem, first with the likelihood of unnecessary wear on the pocket, and second, that the knife could accidentally be pocketed with the clip unsecured, making it easier to loose the knife. I'll be using it without the clip, in fact, I may remove it so I'm not tempted. Then again, the clip also works as a fingertip grip surface for one handed operation. I'd reconsider this design for another."
168064,1,i like this basketball. has good grip and a great bound. to me it feels lighter than a normal basketball
284778,0,"I purchased a 12oz. Klean Kanteen sippy cup in pink. Well as soon as you put a cold beverage in it, it becomes like a giant freezing block of ice for my daughter to hold. Then it sweats a lot and loses temp.I researched some more and discovered Hydro Flask through Amazon reviews. ALL their bottles are insulated, and they offer a 12oz. size one. Not sure why KK doesn't offer 12oz. size insulated bottles, and their wide mouth bottles (I purchased a couple of those to try out) well the gaskets are a pain to replace and you have to order a ""gasket replacement kit."" But besides that, those don't work for little kids. I liked the style of the cap on the KK 12oz. size but wanted it to be insulated!So I ordered a purple Hydro Flask in 12oz. for my 18mon. old daughter. Then I got the idea to see if the KK sippy cup adapter would work on the standard mouth 12oz. HF bottle. It did!! I was so excited, I now have found the PERFECT solution and the perfect bottle for my daughter, yeah! :) And when she's older, I'll just put the HF cap back on that came with the bottle, which is very much like the KK loop cap for classic bottles.I posted about it on the Hydro Flask site, if anyone wants to see the pic. I don't know why I don't see a link HERE to upload a pic, only a video?!?[...]And no I don't work for any of these companies, I'm just a mom wanting to share with other parents our there. :)"

216605,2,"This tent was very easy to setup and easy enough to put back. I was able to get it back in the bag fairly easily. However we have heavy rain this past Saturday night and it didn't do a very good of keeping rain out. Of course for the price I paid I shouldn't have been very surprised, but if you're looking for a sturdy 3-4 person tent for all weather camping this is probably not the choice for you."

It did not arrive in time and when I received the e-mail confirmation for the order and noted it was scheduled for regular shipment, I e-mailed back asking if this could be corrected.

306706,1,"I belong to a recreational volleyball league and decided to invest some money on a REALLY good volleyball. Seriously, before I bought this I had no understanding of cost concerning a good volleyball.Having paid nearly $50 for this, I was really hopeful that I would love it (as would my teammates). When it arrived it was a little under-inflated but it was great-- the leather was soft and no matter how hard I hit the ball on my hand, my arm didn't hurt too much.Yes, this ball was so great that it was STOLEN from me. I don't know who the jerk is but I hope it was worth it (""Dear V-all Pilferer: YOU SUCK""). Despite having lost the ball, I decided to buy another one, the exact same ball. I'm still playing with it today and I love it. This time however, I have written my intials ALL OVER THE BALL with a sharpie. Obnoxious, yes, but I hate it when people steal my stuff."
356066,1,was very impressed with stand when it arrived was very well built and flexed very well when people were using it this past summer looks like a winner
345005,0,"This is a nice product, just be careful with the sizing. My son wears a size 12 jeans and weighs about 90 pounds, he needs a size medium pants. I had trouble finding the sizing chart and ordered the wrong size. Also, the belt isn't a ""true"" belt in that it doesn't go all the way around the pants so you can't buy a larger size and just tighten the waist."
297957,1,"Item arrived very quickly and new in package. I ordered a different size so the fit would be a little better for me and it was great. Not sure if I would go with the Velcro going forward though. It's a little stiff and makes it a little bulkier. If you are debating, just get one without the Velcro. It won't slide out!"
31987,0,"I loved this bike. Easy to assemble out of the box. It is sturdy and the contrasting paint job is nice. My 7 year old daughter, however, insists that it is hard to ride; meaning it doesn't go as fast as the 10-year-old bike (refurbished courtesy of granddad) she found in the barn and prefers to ride the speckled-blue spray-painted rusty-chained hand-me-down instead. Go figure! If my daughter loved it as much as I do, I would have rated it 5 stars."
23570,1,My daughter was 10 months old when I first got this helmet and she has a small head so I had a hard time finding a small enough helmet. The helmet size easily adjusts and the smallest setting actually fits her perfectly. She will be able to wear it for a long time. I liked that it is gender neutral as well so that when the next baby comes a long we will have a helmet to use whether it's a brother or a sister.
317651,1,Thanks for the speedy service. This product is excellent and helps keep the hernia in place. I would recommend this product to anyone with a hernia it really helps a lot.
316467,1,These gloves are great. Way better than any of the more expensive gloves I have had in the past. They breath more and do not have too much padding. Fit is good as well.
459449,2,i ordered two of these saddles because they looked nice. What sold me was the hint of red pictured on the saddle. The saddle DID NOT have any red on it what so ever. Also the product is labeled as a Gel seat. it is definatley NOT gel. its just foam.I took the saddles off and switched back to the old ones.
281413,2,"I love the filter itself, but our new faucet doesn't take the counter top model. The first time I installed it, it was leaking, and in the process of fixing this leak, it broke, and I had to buy a whole new unit. Now it doesn't leak, but it also doesn't work. Several complained about slow water, but in mine, it just doesn't even go. It sounds like from the other reviews that this product is simply not there. We like the spout itself (matches our new faucet very nicely), but the rest of the materials are very chinsy (mostly cheap plastic). I've sent them emails, but so far have not heard back. Like other reviews have said, ""don't buy."""
271223,2,I hate being a walking advertisement for sporting clothes companies. So I was disappointed to see the Russell shirts I ordered all have the annoying white logo on the sleeve. Can't wear these to work...oh well.
363293,2,"Yes, this looks like it would be loads of fun but it really isn't. It's not at all like a trampoline because, in spite of what is advertised, most of the jumping energy is absorbed by the water. In addition, it's not built to withstand normal exposure to weather and sunlight. We have it anchored in the middle of a small fresh water pond in a mild climate (Alabama). Our ladder attachments deteriorated at the start of the second season. I was able to repair that with a hand stitcher but then the trampoline ring attachments, spring cushion and springs disintegrated and that was beyond repair. Overall, I guess I could say we got maybe 2 seasons of ""light"" use out of it -- I'm estimating about 25 cents per bounce. On a positive note, the inflatable ring part still holds air so we use it like a giant (rather expensive) inner tube. By contrast, we also bought one of those inexpensive (land) trampolines at the same time and it's still in fine shape. BTW - that ""Lifetime Warranty"" is laughable. RAVE Customer Service quickly and conveniently decided that this was ""normal wear"" and was not covered. They wouldn't even return our follow-up calls. Shameful."
313187,1,"I bought this backpack and another one for a one week trip through Europe.This bag was really good and I really liked it. The only problem I found is that the handle of the backpack was unwinding on the left side. it seemed that it would last for a while, but I had to start being more careful with it.It was my first backpacking trip, so I did put a lot of things, but the backpack wasn't full.Another problem that I found on this one is the lack of pockets, since I lack many pockets in the bags. There is one in the top, the main one and a small one in the front, wich connects to the main compartment. But we can work with that."
416335,1,"This worked great. Do have to be careful that bag is locked around the ring, but other than that it did great. Lightweight, but sturdy."
293259,0,I purchased one for myself and another for a police friend. My sheath was not molded correctly which makes the knife one Inside the sheath very loose and prone to being taken. My friends sheath was molded tightly which makes the knife snug. Knife seems high quality but the sheath for me makes this knife what it is and I questioned returning it.
480326,0,"I hoped these would be soft, but they are not. I should have ordered 100% cotton.Meant for working out at the gym, but I wouldn't wear them anywhere else."
185517,0,"They're not stretchy, very stiff, and the waistband digs into your hips. However, they did look good, I'd just prefer a more comfy pair of yoga pants. I couldn't imagine doing any yoga in these."
386285,1,"We originally purchased the wobble board because my husband has weak ankles. Well, it's helping to strengthen his ankles and so much more. The DVD has several exercises and stretches that help work your entire body. It's a nice, sturdy, high quality board."
217471,2,"I purchased two pair of these breeches. Upon wearing the first pair, the waist was baggy, which caused the crotch to sag a lot. I return the other pair."
115371,2,"The sound on this helmet cam is not very good. The mic. picks up way too much of background noise. A small piece of tape on mic. helps a little, actually definitely worth the under $100 price tag, but would recommend waiting for ATC 3K."
44732,1,The Huntsman lite is an excellent knife with plenty of tools that all work!
17026,1,Very functional sling but really nothing special. Would buy again if given the chance as it is a well made sling.
429758,2,"They are cute, but cheap! They were bent when I received them. I would never order these again. Not at all what I expected."
81696,1,"I love this watch. It doesn't have or need any wires to hook to your shirt or chest. Just simply use 2 fingers to press the 2 buttons on the face of the watch. It has a lot more programs than I thought it would have. It has regular time with the day and the date in the face, heart rate, alarm, calorie counter, timer, dual, and CHR. It is great. I dont even use all of the programs. Actually, I wear the watch everyday, even when I am not working out."
109315,0,"These shorts run ridiculously small. I triple checked the size on the tags and on the interior because I was so sure I was sent the wrong pair. Since these are so much smaller than I expected, I would definitely recommend trying these on in a store to determine size. Plus, I didn't know until too late that the seller gouges the price for shipping, in both directions, which is going to make returning them a really expensive hassle. So, be sure to review all the necessary details of the shipping policy and rates before purchasing."
57110,0,"When the shipment was received, there was a total of 2 mats/rugs. So, I checked to make sure that I wasn't charged twice...I wasn't. The discription states ""area rug"" so why did it get 2? I would have been happy with 1 at 1/2 the price. Was I supposed to get 2 ""car mats"" or did I recieve an extra 1? They measure about 27 inches."
134383,2,The mask constantly leaks water and does not seal properly around the face. I would not recommend buying this mask.
116910,1,"We first had a topeak seat- while it was very safe and study it dwarfed our small toddler (started using at 12 months.) It was so big and the back of the seat always pushed his helmet over his eyes. While he seemed to enjoy riding with us, he didn't seem to like the seat. We got the ibert a few months later (when he was 15 months and 22 lbs.) and he loved it- our only regret is that we wish that we would have gotten it sooner. We use the seat for short rides around town and it's great for those purposes. Based on other reviews I was cautious about how it would fit on my bike (I'm 5' 2"" and have a women's frame mountain bike) so we actually were able to go to our local bike shop and have them install it to make sure it would fit. Also, the current models come with the seat pad (and the price is about $10 higher to include the pad) so check to see if you are getting the newest model that includes the seat pad."
458547,0,"Looks great overall, but construction quality is questionable. Loose thread scraps are everywhere! I have worn and washed them a few times now. So far, I'm still good, but such an abundance of thread scraps makes me nervous."
95601,0,"But, while wearing it the traction to the floor is not so good, so you could slide just a bit. If that is not a concern for you, then these are wonderful slippers."
170230,0,"Pretty thin walls on this container; I have bumped it a couple of times, dropped it one or two times and looks like I threw it off a tall building. It's like it's made out of wax, if you bump it or drop it, your ""accidents"" will show. It's the Dorian Gray's picture of metal water bottles."
204054,1,Used this rack for a trip to Arizona and back from Minnesota. Very pleased with how solid it kept the bikes. No bouncing around. Quick and easy loading and unloading the bikes. I am very happy with my choice.
125323,1,"These are an upgrade from my previous set of Harvard paddles. These are a dramatic improvement in control, spin, and sound (rather than the muted sound, the Butterfly paddles produce a traditional pong sound that helps identify the speed of the returner's shot. It also provides sonic feedback on the shot that you yourself have hit.) I can generate good speed, create predictable spin, produce touch shots, and direct the depth and angle of the shot. The price was great for 4 paddles."
235930,1,"Likes : Price and Purpose, feels comfortable with the small yet chunky Glock 30 SF in your side, fits snug no loose or wabbling feeling while transitioning from sitting to walking vise versa. Fit's Gun Perfectly no issues with magazine release button accidentally ejecting magazine. retention is perfect, easy to draw out and draw in but very still while in holster.Dislikes: Not meant for concealment (unless using a jacket) Holster is small enough to carry around comfortably but still bigenough to be noticed while using T shirts and or tank tops.Final Word: I bought this holster because it was very affordable for a retention holster for my Glock 30 SF as I mention above I use it as concealment when I wear Jackets or large sweaters without a doubt it's not good for T shirts or tank tops yet always comfortable with my overall wardrobe. Im very pleased with the product, it suites my intentions great non expensive holster for a &#34;compact&#34; Glock 30 SF."
126533,0,"I found that this seat was not as comfortable as I though tor hoped it would be. Yeah, seat is wider than most seats, but padding is not that good. Thought of ordering the Gel pad for this, but it costs twice as much as the seat did.Its ok for short rides, but if you are going for a 15 to 20 mile ride, better be ready for the soreness to set in."
351502,0,"The rear light is great, though I do worry about snapping the clip (mentioned in other reviews - its hard unflexible plastic vs flexible plastic or metal for a more solid build). However, I have issues with the front light:1) it's HUGE. and HEAVY. bobs up and down a bit because it doesn't attach super tight.2) the top isn't covered well, and it shines in your eyes at night a bit. not the best design."
427556,0,This is a cheap holster. It is good enough to get the job done (holding a gun). It is mostly used in my wife's purse so it keeps the gun upright in her purse.
169054,0,I bought a LARGE reflector vest and was very surprise to find it too SMALL. I was not comfortable sending it back because I did not want to pay for more shipping cost. I will not do business with this company anymore.
237249,1,For a small these are a bit big but I got them for home use only. They're comfy and usual Jerzees quality.
184332,1,"This helmet is light, it has a comfortable fit, it has good ventilation, it is easy to adjust(front and back) and it is a durable, sturdy choice for every day use.Yes, I would recommend this to a friend."
333906,2,"I bought this watch 3 months ago. The watch was listed at $375.00 but sold for $92.00. Sound like a bargain? Think again. The watch has never kept proper time, stops running after only a few hours, it's supposed to be water resistant to 10 ATM's but fogs up every time it gets wet. Not submerged - wet! I have had to make corrections to the time and date so often the stem just fell off. I contacted AMAZON who told me to contact CROTON. CROTON wanted me to send the watch and $25.00 to ""tune it up"". Call me silly but why should a brand new watch need a tune up and why should I pay them to fix a brand new $375.00 watch? I opted to offer the free advertising. And here it is."
95009,1,"I love this workout, it is very challenging but you are able to modify any of the exercies either by doing it slower or not as fully."
278179,0,I am a kite surfer and wanted something for the cold days. They are way too stiff and make it very tiring to hold onto the bar for any long period of time. I know this is not their intended use so i cannot say they are bad. Perhaps for diving this is how they should be. They are high quality though and otherwise comfortable.
29298,1,"Don't toss the cable.It's not short indeed. The cable does not have to go ""two ways"" like those with embedded locks. Just tie the cable around the front rim by pulling one end loop through another (the tip is on the product photo) and hook the ""free"" end to the U-Lock.In most cases you can pull the cable through the rear rim as well. I'm using Sheldon Brown's locking method, the cable length could be even shorter for it."
189658,2,"The shorts fit reasonably well, but the fabric was sheer to the point of showing everything underneath. Considering most cyclists don't wear anything else underneath their cycle shorts, it was pretty indecent!"
138824,2,"I read just about all of the 90+ review. Same issues, busted up boxes with missing parts and a rear wheel that goes bad. How can this continue? Why does Amazon even sell these, and how is Razor dealing with this? Don't they get the message by now something is wrong?"
136966,1,I would love to have one more of this watch coz I love it.Most especially the color it has.Pls send one to me .This is my e mail.
487661,1,Yes! I was very pleased with my order. It came in plenty of time for me to give as a Christmas present.
265162,1,I ordered these shirts for work to wear under my police uniform/ballistic vest etc. and desired something that would not add to the heat. These shirts are great. Best I have tried. Comfortable and little accumulated moisture.I have a trial period for PRIME and was amazed that I odered the shirts on July 5 with 2 days shipping free. Arrived July 6th. Sweet! Highly suggest this purchase for any activity where heat could be an issue.
182999,0,A little too thin and too shortNot what I expected being deluxe grade I thought it would be a little heavier material
353940,0,"I bought it due to the fact its made from recycled material and I consider my self a ""green person"". Only thing I dont like about it is that it takes a while to get the mat in the bag. The other bag I have you just unzip and place it in there, with this one its more of a challenge because you cant just slide it in there, you have to wiggle and pull and move it around. So other than that its good to buy if you are concerned about the planet every lilttle purchase helps!"
212813,1,"Better and more convinent than a full size bike. I use it under my computer desk - perfect, well made, sturdy."
162682,1,There were no surprises.The watch does what it is suppose to do and I have no complains.So far it has worked without flaw.
349391,0,This dvd is not worth the cost of shipping. I was extremely disappointed. I can see why it was so cheap.
314103,0,"Worked right out of box, but springs are strong and when closed it didn't work well, so I had to open the battery compartment, and it worked well. If you can play with it a bit, you'll have a nice little unit for the price. Kept minnows alive for 8 plus hrs in 10Q bucket."
438571,0,We have to have these pants for our school uniforms. The pants fit weird. The waist is super small and the length super long and I have very tall children 5 Ft at 9yrs old. and the pants are at least 6 inches to long if I buy the correct waist measurement.
485733,1,"I think the first time I got these shorts it was from a sporting goods store. These shorts have an outdoors adventurer type of feel to them, and quite comfortable. After a few months the snap-button pops loose easily so I wish it had a standard button instead. But these are still the best shorts I've found in a while so I bought a whole bunch when I found out I can get them on Amazon too..."
52629,0,"If you are over 6 feet tall I would stay away from Russell items. I have had problems with the arms being too short in the past, but I figured I would try this ""nu blend."" Same problem- Russell seems to be under the impression that all athletes have short arms."

110255,0,I ordered this for my wife. She isn't complaining about her uncomfortable seat anymore. I only wish the seat encouraged her to ride more often. LOL
40979,0,"It fits on any car window. I would suggest that you don't buy one for your house window since it is pretty small. It's a flag, nothing special."
510639,2,"If I could I would give this item less than one star. Do not buy! It is extremely hard to inflat. In addition, it is very hard to insert the pump into the air outet."
51492,2,"I had to return this product. The seller understood. It was just way too small for anything. I highly recommend looking twice at the dimensions of this rucksack before purchasing it for books or anything. It is cute, but you might want to go with the bigger version. Thanks:"
295321,0,"This watch is uncomfortably huge; it seems to follow the current trend of ""large is stylish"" but it is too large, too heavy, and too uncomfortable for daily wear and use. Having owned and worn a Seiko dive watch for years, I could not comfortably keep this watch (and wear it) so returned it."
210930,1,"I absolutely love 5.11's clothing! These polo's are awesome! They're very comfortable, made out of quality material, and constructed perfectly. I have several of them and will buy more when I wear them out. Highly recommended!!!"
455899,1,"i got this pogo stick for my little brother. He's small for his age, and i was worried because most pogo sticks would either hold too much weight therefore leaving him too small to make it jump, or too flimsy. I was at first turned off by ""foam"" in the title, but after researching all the available sticks, I took a chance on this one, and it has been far beyond expectation. The foam doesn't rip easily, and it provides excelent cushion for a more comfortable ride. Also the knob at the end is nice and wide for good balance. My brother got it in the mail, and for the next week, spent more time on his stick than off. he came to a 2 hour game of mine and pogo'd the whole time...he didn't stop once!overall a great stick and highly recommended for smaller children."
371827,0,"When I bought this shirt it seemed pretty sweet, however, after one washing (cold water, delicate dry) it shrank two inches in length in the body and about an inch in the sleeves. Fortunately I bought it for work so it is not that critical, but it is now definitely too short. I would recommend instead the Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Crewneck Sweatshirt. Super sweet and warm, and no shrinking..."
53684,0,"Nice t-shirt; however, the length shrank a little. Fabric is going to be durable."
430148,1,"I had been looking for a pair of black, sporty, comfortable shoes for walking around campus for a while now. I happened to come across this pair and decided to take a chance with them. I haven't worn Reeboks since I was like 10 years old.. and I think these were a killer deal at 25.99. I didn't want completely black shoes, and I really like how the gum colored sole of the shoes breaks up the blackness of the shoe, and the moderately gray stripes on the side aren't too bright. I'm not a very flashy person, and so I had planned on switching out the shoelaces anyways, but these shoes do come with an extra pair of black laces. There are only three small RBK logos in orange; two as seen in the picture on the tongue and on the bottom front portion, along with one on the upper back portion of the shoe. The shoes are surprisingly comfortable and padded like typical skate shoes, only that they don't have the super puffy, wideness of most skate shoes, which I really don't like. They give the slim feel and lightness of pumas, while retaining the ultra comfort and well-cushioned feeling of any other skate shoes. However, I have to admit that I have thin feet, and these shoes are slim enough that they fit just right. I wouldn't recommend these to people with really wide feet. For anybody else, these shoes are extremely comfortable and have a really great look to them. A sort of subtle ostentatious feeling to them. Well-made product."
418014,1,"UA black polo, love the material, quick to dry, easy to wash, very comfortable to wear. I wear this as part of my work uniform and even out and about!"
329041,1,"I'm 5'1 and short-legged. It's very difficult for me to find full-length pants that are short enough for me. The 29-inch length is perfect!!! The material is nice too: very sturdy, doesn't shrink after washes, and stay dry while working out. I'm going to get a few more of different colors.The only downside, if you can call that, is that these pants are not as low-waisted as they look in the picture. Maybe because I'm so short, but the waist band is right at the bottom of my belly button, which is a bit higher than I expected. But I don't mind if i wear them folded at the waist."
426371,1,"These had warmers take about 15-20 minutes to warm up yet, when they do, they are not only really warm but they stay warm for almost 24 hours (around 18-20 hours, from experience)."
242743,1,This is a great addition to your gun good for BT 4 combats. Like most reviews have said you need to make the hole wider for the spring but that's simple enough. The only problems with the stock is it rattles and the butt of the stock is rough but these issues aren't a big deal.
261658,1,"I do a lot of night riding and I ride with a lot of night riders. Some people like to mount two or three rear lights to try to improve visibility. There's nothing wrong with that, but I think variety is the key. After all, if one taillight doesn't get a driver's attention, why would two? That's where this device comes in. Because it's attached to your ankle it moves up and down as you pedal. That makes it different so I think drivers who might tune out a tail light might 'see' this better. That doesn't mean it's a substitute for a tail light - just that it's a good addition.It's best to wear this on the left ankle (although one on each ankle would be even better). It also has the advantage that drivers approaching from the side can see it - even those approaching from the opposite side.The construction is good with an adjustable clip on an elastic strap so it fits conveniently but firmly to your ankle. There is an excess of strap which has to be tucked in and sometimes works its way lose. The light is bright enough to be seen from 1/4 mile on a dark road and perhaps 100 yards in an urban setting. It runs off of a watch battery. I don't know what the run time is but I've only replaced the battery once in two years. There is a solid and a flashing mode - I only use flashing."
447732,1,"This is just what we wanted to go spotting deer at night. You can see them from quite a distance. And it is easy to handle. Since I didn't have the faintest idea what I was looking for in a spotlight, I want to thank you for showing the correct product to me. It made a great Christmas present for my husband."
509002,0,"The long and short of it. The swiveling handles are awesome. The cord is pure crap.Bad: The cord is standard width (making it easy to substitue), however it's extremely light. I get it, ""It's a speed rope so let's ship it with a light cord, right?"" Well the hollow cord is TOO light. Seriously you need a little weight for resistance sake and to help with the rewinding action. Am I right? Anyway my long lived Ironman Speed Rope (see no longer available here:[...] was near perfect except the quality of it's handles were evident of it's $10-12 price tag. To get to the point - I snipped my Ironman rope, which has a solid core and is a perfect weight, then wound that one right into the the Buddy Lee handles - I didn't have to make a hole. Now I have a perfect jump rope.Good: The swivel action is so worth it. Honestly the only legitimate complaint anyone could have is because of the quality of the cord shipped with the setup. The handles have a short, non-bulky grip and it took some getting used too but the designers really have something. The foam meat(grip) sits in your palms and allows your fingers to close around the smaller area protruding from the foam grip. It's clever stuff.Recommendations: Find a standard with speed rope cord that is not hollow, take some pliers and wind that bad boy right into these handles. You can find a solid cord on a rope in any sports store. I'm positive new buyers will read this and put the crap cord in first to prove me wrong but I am very sure you will be disappointed."
306864,1,"I bought these t-shirts for my husband. They were a tad thinner than I expected, but they are a very nice product. These are one of the few t-shirts that give my husband the space he needs between his shoulders. He really likes the way they feel and thinks they are very comfortable. If he likes them, that's fine with me. I'll probably buy more as he needs them. I would have rated them 4-1/2 stars, if available."

8223,0,"It's not like looking out your car's rear view mirror since a bike isn't as stable a platform for a mirror as a car.

494296,0,"This sword looks AWESOME, so I bought it for my husband who loves swords! He was very happy with the look, but the feel of the sword has a lot to be desired. The sword is not sturdy, and it shakes alot. If this sword was to be played with, I have no doubt that it would fall apart in my hand. If you want something pretty to look at, then this is your sword for you! Otherwise, move on to something more battle ready."
159292,0,"I bought 10 different color pair of these gloves. I love all the fun colors, but the gloves showed significant wear after only one time.

303041,1,This is a great product and exactly what I was looking for. Product arrived quickly and was just as described. My husband and I love it!
491277,0,"Deceptive ad to the max, we don't care to have discription in metric. Makes product seem larger than it is. Also cap to bottle broken with no contact info in package to replace. Better off buying a stainless bottle at Albertsons or Vons."
9157,0,"This vest is as advertised but is very small for it's rated size. I had to return the vest as it was just too small and out of stock larger. I would say it is a medium or maybe large at best, certainly not an XL by most standards. Quality seemed fine."
86350,1,very happy with purchase. works great to water proof and crush proof items and still be able to see inside.
58081,1,"These work really well. I have 10 in. blades, and I didn't have to cut them down at all. I'm not sure how you would cut them down as they are super thick. If you have blades much smaller than 10 in., you will need something really heavy duty to cut them to size. The springs were a little difficult to get on, but my husband and I managed them without too much problem. I got the green pearlz, and I really like their color (although it is a bit different from how it appears on here)."

349110,0,I bought a bar for my girls to practice at home and thought this would be helpful to protect there hands from blisters but the sizes were too small. If its suppose to be for beginners I assumed the small would be good for my 7 year old but they were too tight. The straps bother them. It rubs at there wrist and is more painful than blisters. Haven't tried anything else yet to compare to trying to find a local place that my girls could try on the grips first. Just overall a poor quality for beginner gymnastic.

386278,0,Item arrived very quickly and as described. The wobble board is a very challenging way to exercise that could become frustrating after a short time.
288779,0,"It's not the best by far, but it's fun to play around with. Not very bright but some how I rigged it to my flatline barrel on my A-5 but it was VERY tricky because the srews it comes with where no where near long enough for the job. Not for up scale work and not completely accurate, but for just messing around I've got no complaints."

42119,0,"its a decent gun( i got mine for cheaper). the clip is moderate capacity, i would say about 50 to 70 rounds. i dont know the exact fps, but it isnt the greatest in the world. one thing you should know is that the first shot falls out the barrel, the second gets about 10 feet, the third about 20, and then it gets full range after that. so semi auto is useless on this gun."
313735,0,"These are very comfortable gi pants. They are a good heavy weight, but soft cotton, not the heavy canvas type, flexible and easy to move in. I've had several different gi pants, and these are, by far my favorite. They are elastic waistband, rather than drawstring, but I prefer that. And as a female martial artist it can be difficult finding gi pants that fit well, but these are definitely the best I've worn.Update to this review: I had decided to purchase another pair of gi pants and ordered these again since I liked them so much the first time. Unfortunately, the gi pants that arrived this time were nothing like the first. The previous pants were brushed cotton, elastic waist. The pants I received the second time were the heavy canvas type material, drawstring waist, and had the ProForce label on the front, exactly what I did not want. I'm guessing the description is intentionally confusing because the pants come from different vendors and Tiger Claw has no idea what may really be shipping? At least I was able to return them without difficulty and was able to find another pair of gi pants elsewhere that fit perfectly. Just be aware when ordering the gi pants may be different than what you expect."
367044,0,"The color was not black, it was blue, that is my main reason for only three stars. Otherwise this coat is flattering to most body types. It is very well made, material looks good, but holds wrinkles. I have worn it it in below freezing temps and it holds up to the cold and strong winds very well. Hopefully designers will come up with a better fitting hood, it is a little too much for me."
208697,0,"Gave is 3 stars because the swivels were not the same as the product. All tho, it works awesome that was my only problem. Other than that the rubber texture is really something...grabs on anything and will stay there, plus swivels were nice black lightweight aluminum(?) and havnt had any problem while shooting.First sling i bought and would buy another one"

392291,1,"Jan 2011 Been using this for a few weeks now and am very satisfied with it.Had to really read the manual and work on it for like a couple hours to determine my heart rate zone and set up and get going but it's easy to use by the time you're done setting it up (it didn't take days for me to remember how to do things without the manual thereafter.)I have a rather small wrist and the smallest watch band setting fits me. I'm on the short, medium size side and the monitor also fits. Using a sewing measuring tape, the watch from one end to the other is approx 9"" (of course, you need to take into account that the holes don't extend to the innermost or outermost point.) The heart monitor case is approx 12.5"". The monitor band is elastic and, unstretched, is approx 20.5"" at it's longest setting and 11.5"" at it's shortest.When I put the monitor on, I usually get a little water from the sink and wet my skin under the monitor and the heart rate picks up immediately. Thereafter, the sweat does it for me. I haven't had trouble getting a signal and keeping it.I like that you can enter your age, weight, gender, and target heart rate. There are multiple options to view your heart rate (just heart rate, lap time plus heart rate, etc) which is excellent. Mostly I use it to keep within my heart rate zone and see how many calories I've burned.While I like the feature to beep when not in target zone, it is a little too loud and frequent (think alarm clock beep!beep!beep!) to have to listen to during the legitimate times you are not in the target zone (like warm up and cool down) and there is no easy one button off/on for the notification so you can shut it up part of the time. While perfect for runs where you can slow down and speed up at will, when working out to DVDs you don't really have a choice and there are periods where you slow down and it's just too annoying. Would have been better if alert was lower/softer sound and spaced farther apart between beeps.Jan 2012 Heart rate monitor no longer working even though replaced battery. Still, was good enough that I will buy another to replace the original."

507358,1,"Ok, so i got this thing a few weeks ago and it is so beast. Its more accurate and powerful and a m182 i have. At first i figured a $20 pistol is going to suck, but after i fired it I couldn't beleive how insane this was. A few hours ago me, my brother, and his friend went sonny corleone on my bro's girlfriend. they had 182's and i had this beast. they were shooting way faster than me, but i hit her more times than anyone. she rolled up her window and sped down the block, and all their bbs were going like 20 feet and at like 40 feet i was still hitting her car. we probably shot like 2 or 3 hundred bbs and i hit all of mine and they hit about a quarter of theres. if u get this gun, u wont need anything else going into battle."
285848,0,"I have mixed feelings about my Simms wading staff. The central cable keeps the staff well connected during use, but after about four seasons of use it came loose and the sections fell apart - first day of a three day fishing trip. Here in PA we have some rock bottom streams, so I found it necessary to modify the metal tip to allow me to install a rubber tip so that I'm not transmitting loud noises each time I plant the staff. I like the formed handle a lot, but the location of the nylon strap (on top of the handle) caused it to rub the back of my hand all day. To avoid this problem I had to use black electrical tape to lash the nylon strap down the back of the handle so it emerges below my palm. Works great that way. When I purchased my Simms staff they were using a 3oz. pull weight retriever which allowed the weight of the staff alone to pull the cable out and I had to bend over to get the handle each time I wanted to use the staff. After I complained Simms did send me an additional retriever which I black taped in tandem with the original. Bottom line is that I am about to order another and go through all the modifications over again. I'm anxious to see whether Simms will repair the one I will be sending back."
495440,1,"This is my first chronograph watch. Styling and execution are top notch, although I'd really prefer if the second hand would sweep instead of the small hand on the left subdial."
112017,0,It's made from a comfotable material but it does not have a hem string so it tends to hang too loosely when worn as a outer garment.Works nicely when worn as an inner garment
112141,2,"Wasn't what I expected. I had purchased this to replace my usable, yet wearing down Timex Ironman. It doesn't have half the functionality of my Ironman, and costs about 20-30 dollars more. Unless you like fancy watches, or only use a watch to tell time(Yeah, I know how it sounds.), I suggest getting something else. I use my watch for a lot more than just the time, so that's mostly why I gave this a bad review. Returned and am still using my Timex Ironman."

417540,0,"We have had this trike for several years. It is a good trike, except for one thing. The tires are plastic and if your child has to ride uphill or up a driveway, the wheels spin because there is very little traction on them. Our drive way is on a very small incline, but my kids have the awfullest time getting the trike up the drive way unless they use their feet to push it or get off and push from behind."

435851,0,Why is there a cancer warning about nickel in the product? Is there a risk to the person using the sharpener if she inhales dust?
304108,0,"When it arrived at my house I took it out of the box only to find that the blade was dirty. This is really uncalled for. They could at least have cleaned it. Not only that, it was also somewhat dull. The dullness was most likely caused by someone using it. Maybe I bought a used one, i don't know. I was under the impression that it was new when I made the purchase. Other than those major flaws everything looks good. Haven't had to use it yet because of the lack of zombies nearby."
207873,0,"I had used Uncle Mike's holsters for decades and they were at one time high quality. This thing is a piece of junk. Not only does it not come with all the parts to put it together it does not say anywhere in the description you need to assemble it yourself. Not just adjust it, assemble it.I am not going out to the hardware store to buy the screws that it didn't come with so I am sending it back. The instructions are useless if they don't send all the parts.Never again Uncle Mike. Contacting Uncle Mike/Bushnell by email is impossible as they don't post an email address on their websites.UPDATE: After calling Bushnell (Uncle Mike's parent company) support I found that it is supposed to ship with all the hardware and assembled. The clamshell packaging is not sealed, but snaps together. It appears Amazon shipped a holster from which someone has stolen parts. I am sending it back but I will give Uncle Mike's another chance to send a functional holster."

304102,0,"I wasn't expecting much to be honest...basically a decent piece of spring steel that I could rely on in case I'm ever without a gun if SHTF. Mix that with a bit of wanna-be Michonne-ish inner geek and you have an idea of my expectation. Never intend on hanging it on the wall, or worshipping its curves for hours on end...just wanting a tool. I have to say my expectation is mostly met except in one way...the damn thing is dull. Not being an experienced ninja/samauri...or even an amature, I'm not so sure what to expect in the way of sharpness. I was under the impression these were supposed to be hair-shaving razors. Instead it's more like a dull pocket knife. I'm pretty sure I can work on the blade a bit with some whetstones, leather, and rouge...but feel a bit cheated here. It's also a bit dirty, but I expected there would be some machining oils from mass production."
406468,1,"I've had this tire on my bike for about 4-5 months and it still has great tread, I ride in the woods and also romp on the gas in the streets so surprisingly it hasn't worn down from the pavement. Other than that great traction no acedental slips. Great buy"

410459,1,"If you are a cheapo like me you prob thinking you can get away with buying baby powder and save the $14 -$20 you are going to pay. Well, ill tell you what when I broke up one block of this (8 blocks per order) I realized I was going to have a lot of chalk for a long long time. I filled about 2 inches of a sandwich bag with just like about a 1/4 block and still thats a lot. Prob a 1/4 - 1/2 a block would last me 1 - 2 months using a moderate amount chalking up before every lift 3 days a week. Worst case scenario one order (8 blocks) should last you one year ! Do the math, even if u use a little bit more than 1/2 a block a month still thats about a year. Oh and it sure beats baby powder, baby powder is smelly and it gives u a soft grip. This chalk gives you a firm grip and does not have smell. Well if you are reading this review, do reviews on this or any other products because its what makes this work. I use to get lazy and not do them but I realized that there are people out there that help us by reviewing so the least you can do is help them by doing a review."
458493,0,"I own and fish with a Daiwa Luna. This Millionaire S series is not even in the same league. I've inspected the CV Millionaires which seem to be nicely made rugged reels. The S series hardly even resemble them. I've taken my S series apart and looked closely at how it's made and I'm not impressed. It has a fairly heavy duty looking clicker that makes a loud enough sound. Every thing else about it looks cheap and only time will tell how it will stand up to catching heavy catfish and stripers. The handle knobs are hard, not a softer material you can hang onto with wet hands, the spool tension knob is plastic where it should be metal and the drag star is plastic. I've never had any real problems with plastic drag stars other than they look cheap, but I have had nothing but problems with plastic spool tension knobs. A set of handle grips would take care of the slippery handle knobs. I have fished with a lot of different brand and price range round reels for years. Looking at this reel makes me think it should retail for under 50 dollars. I ordered this reel on sale at an advertised savings of more than 200 dollars. After clicking order I did some research on the S series and found most retailers were selling it for 10 dollars less than what I had ordered mine at and they were advertising it as a budget class reel. I immediately hit the cancel order button but the seller shipped the reel anyway, perhaps before they saw the cancel e-mail or maybe they didn't want to lose a sale. I decided to keep the reel rather than go through the hassle of returning it. It's not very smooth operating, but maybe it will surprise me and last long enough to get my money's worth out of it. There are better round baitcasters out there for what this reel is selling for at it's ""sale"" price."
24113,0,"I've been using these gloves for maybe 2 years now. They are probably the most comfortable gloves I've ever worn....when I first buy them. In the last 2 years I've gone through about a dozen pairs. I buy them at Academy, and I've only actually paid for a few of those pairs. The rest have been replacements due to returning prematurely worn gloves to Academy. It has gotten to the point where anyone working the cust. serv line there knows why I'm there as soon as they see me.These gloves work fine for moderate lifting. They have decent grip when you first buy them, and require no break in like some gloves.But after a while the pinky always splits at the seam. I usually sew this back up. Then the seam on the ridge of the palm splits. I usually sew this too. Then the palms get worn through in small spots, and the rest of the palm becomes worn smooth and hard, offers no grip what so ever. Its not fun curling 145# on an ez bar and having the bar spin in your hands like its on bearings. I'm finally going to try something else."
115513,1,These are great gloves. They were used for doing an ice sculpture also. The company that I got them from was very swift in sending them so that they arrived before Christmas. Would recommend both the gloves and the company.
360987,1,"Just back from family vacation in Nantucket - drove from CT in XC90 with 5 bikes on this rack. It's too close to the back of the car to open the tailgate so I bought an 8"" extension which did the trick. Even with the extension, the rack holds the bikes fairly steady although there's a fair amount of swaying when you go over big bumps.It is expensive, but it's solid and I expect it to last longer than our previous rack (an Allen 4 bike rack) on which 2 of the straps broke after 3 years. I bought the STL2 lock because I prefer to have a hitch pin which goes all the way through but that was not necessary - the pin didn't loosen at all despite being driven over cobbles in Nantucket and even on the beach a few times. Extension is necessary if you want to be open the hatch on most cars, as it is basically impossible to lower this rack once it's loaded with bikes (maybe you could do it with 3 people).I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is expensive. Wal Mart sells a 5 bike rack from Allen for $99, for example, and while I am sure this is better I am not sure it's 2.5x better."

Didn't work wth our Sebring sedan and 2 dual-suspension bikes. They have super beefy odd shaped frames. At the angle it put the rack on the trunk, we just couldn't get more than one bike on. We went with the new version which is the 962xt. Which you still need to get a frame adapter for DS and/or MTB type of bikes."
376339,0,"I got this watch primarily for counting swimming laps. It works great at that- Once I figured out how to do that (it's a little confusing, but then again, I'm no Einstien). Other than that it's a watch worth the money."
432780,0,"Didn't really want to rate this since it will not work with my ProPlus 2.1. Let me say that again, because if you have the Proplus 2.1 rather than the Proplus 2 (the two models are almost identical and have the same functions--only difference is one has two metal buttons). I never dreamed that a "".1"" on the end of the product name would require a completely different PC cable. At 89 bucks a shot that is an expensive oversight, especially after throwing out all the packaging. Bottom line, just thought I would alert the consumer because the different cable requirement is not highlighted by most retailers."
351617,1,"This is a great little light - Visibility is wonderful and very strong. There are three settings, one of which I use day and night because it flashes and is visible from the sides.

The light includes a seat post mount, which I have had to use - the mount on my back basket snapped the first week I had my bike. Overall, I am very pleased by the size, and the amount of light it projects."

46863,1,This pack works great. There is plenty of room for your helmet as well as anything else you want to cary along. It has a pouch for your camelback as well as clips for the tube. this pack will do what ever you want it to do. The only down fall to this pack is the absence of a waist strap. Otherwise it is confortable to cary and very handy.
360768,0,"i was just using it and the trim broke. i hit myself in the face with the bar, fell backwards and hit my head on the wall. my face, the back of my head, and both my jaws hurt! ouch!"
65677,2,I bought one of these back in Sept 2007. The lights work OK (though they seem to drain the batteries faster than a Planet Bike Super Spot). My problem was that a good bounce or accidental hit to the light caused the thin molded mounting fins on the light body to break off. I went thru two lights in about two weeks. It must be a design flaw. I now have two very nice hand held flash lights.

If I could remember if it's a good value or not, I'd possibly give another star. These are thicker than the mexican blankets, the Pune cotton blankets, and thicker than the softer Manduka blankets I bought in purple. They are a little stiff to fold but, not as bad as some that i have. Two provide four inches of lift for sarvangasana."

82018,0,"I wear a size 4 - 6 or small in misses' clothing or a 5 - 7 or small in juniors' clothing. Because these shorts are made of a 50/50 poly-cotton jersey knit, I ordered them a size larger than I normally wear--medium--thinking that even though they initially might be a bit big, they would shrink enough to be a good fit on me. Unfortunately, the medium was far too small for me. In fact, I'd guess that the medium would be a perfect fit for someone who normally wears a small. I have reordered the shorts in a large because they are nicely made and exactly what I need. My only complaint is that the sizing seems very inaccurate. They definitely run about a size smaller than other knit shorts in the same size."

152874,1,"This is a folding knife, not a razor. If you are looking for a folding knife that can be a conversation piece, this is it. A straight edge razor that you can actually shave with costs more than $5.49; a lot more.This knife does not have a liner lock (contrary to what the description says). It has a backspring that holds the blade open, but it does not lock the blade. The backspring does a good job though. This is the reason why this knife is a bit harder to open and close than a liner lock one.Overall, it is a good knife for the price."

334398,0,"I've been carrying this handy little knife around with me on my key chain for the last year or so and I have one big complaint I would like others to be aware of before they look into purchasing this. Overall, the knife is -perfect- for everyday use, other than this concern...This is the location of the lanyard loop, or the ring that you can affix to your key ring. This is located at the base of the blade and at the other side as the toothpick/tweezers. By this placement, whenever I use the knife, I have a ball of keys in my hand. Had the loop been placed at the other end, the keys would dangle off the end out of the way. So, I've found this a not-so-handy, pain in the rear to use. The same problem extents to the tweezers and toothpick. They are dangling off the end, just waiting for something to catch on them and let gravity do the rest. Had these been on the other end, next to the ring, this would be completely avoided. I must admit that maybe the knife opens the way it does for safety reasons, but I think I could manage.So yeah, the knife is great, but the key ring loop is positioned in such a way that it makes using the knife a bit of an annoyance."
385758,0,Perfect rack for light duty. My needs were too much for this product and I replaced it with one that attached at the bottom as well as the seat post. The biggest problem I had was that even with a minimal amount of gear on the rack the center of mass on my road bike was over the back wheel which made it extremely difficult to maneuver when not on the bike i.e. getting in and out of my apartment building.

432515,2,"It's apparent from the photos, but I overlooked how narrow the wrist armature is. To grasp it I have to rotate my wrist sideways to slip it between the metal arms then straighten so the strap is over top of wrist. Definitely designed for a child's hand not an adult's.The rubber tubing is soft and flimsy so it is not possible to pull really hard for much power. Even a child can probably pull hard enough to break it over time, sort of a designed-in power governor for older children tempted to shoot far or hard. For an adult this is only marginally useful for target practice and not much good for dealing with problem birds as I had hoped."
493128,1,"I read over many reviews for various plate racks before deciding on this one, based on form factor and the amount of weights it can hold. I was fairly peeved when I first started assembling it, though, because one of the cross pieces would not fit because there was a huge hunk of welding left behind. This 1/4"" excess meant I could not put the rack together but thankfully, I have a Dremel and was able to grind down the excess welding in about 5 minutes. The only other aggravating part was tightening the bolts for the top 2 weight holders; it is a very tight squeeze and difficult but not impossible to do. Once these issues were resolved, the rack met my expectations and the form factor is perfect for the area I needed to put it. It is sturdy and will probably last the rest of my life."
249986,0,"You cannot get much quality for $150 in a bike (I got one new for $75 @ Meijer on season clearance). Owner's manual was missing which was no biggie for a cyclist.Also, this is not 26"" type. It IS made to fit most riders of this size, however. Front is 16x2.125"" & rear 20x2.125 both Kenda and better than average rims. The gears and such are junk Falcons, but work pretty well. Brakes are linear-pull and stop much better than average for so cheap a bike. Anyway, I checked it over, adjusted the fit as I tried it out. Then the seatpost bent back. And hard to find a good quality post of that size. I've checked my 3 best sources. If they used anything over 26.0 mm, it would be a breeze to get something very good and frugally. I found one post of same apparent quality, in alloy8-(. I'm 5'8"" and have to put post about 4"" close to min marking of post. Weight about 180. Also, this bike is not well understood by 99% of dept store customers, and must be ridden a few miles over some days to like it or hate it. Needs muscle growth a little different than reg bikes. I also figured I'd want to swap gears a bit when I saw it, then vetoed that after I found myself almost huffing & puffing to ride at usual pace. Of course, it's not built for going fast. Best for enjoying views and having fun. Rides nicely on dirt shoulders, wet dry and rocky or on pavement.Personally, I like it a lot & will make room long-term in my stable of asst'd steeds."

They don't really mold good at all and in fact, one of the mouth pieces we had to throw away because after boiling it for the 7 seconds it said on the directions, the mouth piece was rough and wrinkled. We did three of them so we'd have some extras and the other 2 did not do that and turned out ok. But, still just a very basic cheap mouth guard. Can't say I'd recommend it."

I can't say anything negative about it, I highly recommend it to anyone that doesn't want to spend thousands on a nice watch and is looking for a good looking solid everyday watch."

446491,0,"Because you're not working hard; that's why it's so 'smooth': The resistance increases through the rep, so if you choose a setting that allows a full-range rep, the correct resistance is at the full extention of the rep. This gives you the illusion of some work done: The end point is hard, but then, back to the 'smooth, 'comfortable' feeling the rest of the way back and forth. Enough for warm-ups and resistance aerobics, not for strength or muscle. To make it worse, Bowflex tries to simulate gym machines with different, incorrect angles of resistance. Also, keep in mind that the power-rods need a lot of space to curve out during use. (Even Bowflex has changed their form of resistance to 'Spiroflex' on their top model,($2,499+), a night-and-day better resistance curve and much more space efficient.) ///If you already own a Bowflex, I suggest that you do limited range movements: Begin at the first few inches of the movement . Set the rods so that the movement is difficult right away, and work through the few inches of appropriate resistance. The 'hard' side will stop you on it's own, it's the 'easy' side that you must consciously avoid. As you progress, you can avoid any rod changes by merely moving up into the next few inches of the range as you get get stronger, making sure to not to re-trace the newly-too-easy segment. When you are able to do a full set in the last few inches of range with the same rod-setting, add rods and start back at the beginning. (This can be called 'triple-progression': 1/Add reps, 2/After reaching the target rep number, intensify range,3/ After reaching target reps in the most difficult range , start over with added resistance. ) Remember that with such a short range of motion, the usual number of rep will not be enough. You'll have to experiment to find what works for you, but some of the things you can try: A/Very slow movement will increase time-per-rep, and may allow reps numbers to remain in your accustomed range. For short-range, slow reps will probably be around 2 seconds and 2 down. B/stopping for a split second at the peak of the movement can increase intensity....Even if you don't want to work to muscular failure, you might want to do it once or twice to find the proper rep range, after which you can back off a rep."

275328,0,I purchased one of these QAD Ultra-Nok XL a few weeks ago locally and I love it. I had also purchesed some X7 arrows for league archery and a drop away rest.I found that the original nocking loop was too low once I set up the drop away rest with the fatter arrows. The Ultra-Nok was easy to set up. It is best done over something that will catch the tiny screws when you drop them.It worked well for a couple of weeks but then I started to notice that the trigger release was snagging. Also our local archery coach said that as it added weight to the string it would slow the arrow down. I went back to the string knock and the trigger problem seems to have gone away.

The product description clearly says ""..full grain leather cover"" then goes on to say ""ultimate INDOOR basketball"" while the amazon.com product description says ""rubber cover"". So this is a case of confusing advertising. Had I read that all before I quickly pressed ""buy it now"" and had I known it was a regular rubber basketball, I would have continued my search looking for an outdoor leather ball.Like I said, it's probably worth the money, but if you are looking for a LEATHER BALL look elsewhere."

However, the part of the band that holds down the excess amount of strap beyond the buckle came off within a couple of weeks. This leaves about two inches of band extending out away from my wrist. Once I am positive I won't be needing the excess for any further adjustments, I will simply cut it off. I would recommend this watch with the concern that there could be further problems with the band."

I used it for a single bike ride at night and was sort of annoyed that I couldn't get the headlight strapped tight enough on the handlebars, so every so often I would have to grab it and re-aim the light while I was riding. Also, the taillight was missing the cover when I received it from Amazon. I didn't have time to return it and get a replacement, and it still works fine. Can't speak to the brightness of the light as we rode at dusk and not after it got really dark."

I've been buying harbinger wrist wrap gloves for years and when I saw these decided to try something different.The grip on the gloves is great, but not the wrist protection. The way the wrap is designed it does offer a thick barrier that can come in handy when using straps, but for those of us who have wrist issues it doesn't have the same kind of support that the Harbinger wrist wrap gloves do, which start much higher on the hand.It's not a bad glove, but thought this feedback might be valuable to others who have wrist issues and are considering it."

After receiving the item I realized that is was NOT rainproof as advertised. I returned the item with the return shipping lable and a description for why I was making my return, via UPS and was charged $7.65 for return shipping. I was credited by the company for my purchase but NOT for shipping, as a result I paid $7.65 for nothing. I am disapointed that the company had advertised the jacket as a rain jacket when it is not."
36568,1,"Items was deliverd as ordered in about 6 business days. Package and contents were is good condition. After laying out the parts and reading the instructions, assembly took about 1 hour; mechanically challenged should expect about 2 hours. Quality of the 231 is good to excellent. The chassis is sturdy and the connection points are very well designed for strength. The seat & backrest are very comfortable and seem to be well constructed. The cons are: 1) the fan is useless & 2) why have the power adapter external; it should be internal with a long power cord to the wall plug. I intend to mount power strip across the front to plug in the adapter and a floor fan to move some air. Overall the 231 is as good as some of the commercial bikes I have used at the workout center. I have used the bike for several weeks, and as it sets in front of the big screen TV, it continues to ""invite"" me to pedal even during the presidential debates. Considering the price I paid, I call it a ""best value buy""."

However, this one was, visually, a little perplexing.So, I gave in and read the instructions. They were absolutely NO help.The diagrams are worthless and the description on which pieces of hardware you should be using during each assembly step are not real clear.Be prepared to take your time and lay all this out before hand. Took me about 20 minutes after I spent 5 minutes cussing at the instructions!Also, the tools needed diagram on the box is complete balderdash! What you really need are: Hammer (which isn't mentioned on the box), One Adjustable wrench (not two), screwdriver (phillips and slotted because neither seemed to work just right). No allen wrench is needed and you don't need the second adjustable wrench at all.Overall, a good item that felt sturdy after assembly. The graphics are very cool. Be sure you press the stickers down real good as they were coming loose in places. But I have found that typical on almost all toys with vinyl sticker graphics. You just can't find good third-world labor anymore!!!As long as you, or someone you know, is above average mechanical intelligence, you can figure this assembly out.

265028,0,"My 6""5' fiance bought this sleeping bag for himself since it was supposed to be 86"" tall. I'm not sure who measured the bag, but the specs are wrong. I'm 5'9"" and it's a great size for me. It's very cozy with the hood drawn tight.They also say that there is a sheet liner in the bag, but that's not accurate either. A liner means it LINES the bag. This ""liner"" is more like half of a liner. As someone else mentioned, it would be nice if this were a real liner so that it could be washed and the bag would stay cleaner, longer. I feel that the ""liner"" is easy to accidentally unzip, so I can imagine it bunching up at the bottom of the bag after a night's sleep (I haven't slept in it yet).I think the detachable hood is a nice feature. I've never had a mummy bag, so it will be nice to sleep in my bag without wearing a hat on my head to keep warm.I'm very cold-natured, so once I do use this thing (it will get down to freezing this weekend when I use it) I won't be a good judge of how well its temp rating is.The bag comes with a stuff sack, but you can't stuff this sleeping bag like you can nicer bags. This bag has to be rolled tight to fit in its ""stuff"" sack. However, it can be accomplished with minimal difficulty (easier than putting a tent back in its bag!)."
440603,0,"If you don't know better, these probably seem like an improvement over the cheapest karate scrubs available, but compared to quality middle-weights, these really do seem like cheap lightweights. I wanted to replace some quality middle-weights that use a drawstring with something equivalent with this type of waist band. In that regard, this type of waistband is much more comfortable than a drawstring alone. Another plus is that they have a back pocket. Their saving grace is that they only cost about $20.On the downside, as I alluded to, compared to real, quality middle-weights, these are thin, light and abrasive, being partially synthetic. They're more of a middle-ground between real middle weights and light weights. Additionally, unlike a lot of other quality pants, they lack any fastener for the pocket. So don't put anything in it if you're training (not that you should anyway).It's a ""for the money, they're decent"" thing."

12036,0,"I like the cut of the vest and the cattail color is pretty well represented on my monitor - maybe more of a rich brown than the rich maroon-brown I saw, by a slight margin. There's some reddishness. As many others noted it's a thin fleece, so it might not be the best value for the $30 I paid in my size. Whether that thinness becomes a longevity issue or not I'll have to see."
372242,1,"I bought this to replace a folding hibachi that just couldn't cut it. This is a technical grill, so you need to read the instructions, and have some good tongs. You can end up moving charcoal around a bit. I also got the gas attachment. That burned hot in the center and didn't diffuse very well. The instructions do recommend a center plate to help with that.But this puppy pops right up when you grab the handle. And then it collapses as soon as you pick it up. And it is very sturdy while cooking, so that quick change ability does not sacrifice robustness.The grill is designed heavily around dutch oven cooking. It works fine without a dutch oven, but if you do do dutch oven cooking, you'll be in heaven. It also burns wood, so you will always have fuel in a pinch.I prefer to use natural wood charcoal, and this grill is easier to use with briquets. The recipes and temperature references are all ""calibrated"" on briquets.Overall though, this is a fantastic portable grill. Unless you really need the gas, it isn't really required. They also offer a Nomex ""hood"" to cover the grill, so it can bake or smoke. So you end up with a capability to cook many different styles. This is perfect if you are going to be in your RV or popup for an extended time."

Already ripped the 5 iron cover...was being careful when taking it off, but ripped anyway (although it will still be functional). Not a bad product for the price, but would be nice for them to 'slip' off a bit easier. If you're looking for a cheap means to protect your irons, these will do."
389389,0,"I have wanted an indoor smoker since using one in a cooking class a few years ago. I recently purchased this indoor smoker and was very happy when I received it. I first used it with chicken, and it tasted amazing. I love that you can get a well cooked, flavorful, juicy chicken breast without the skin or added fat. However, during the cooking process, smoke was pouring out of the corners of the cooker. I used some wooden clothes pins to hold the corners together, which helped some, but the smoke found other ways out. I had the window open with the vent on, and most of the smoke seemed to be going out the vent. My son did complain of the smoke smell during cooking, though we didn't get the smoke haze another reviewer mentioned.The following day, I had cold like symptoms--stuffy nose, red itchy eyes, dry throat. I assumed I was getting sick, but the symptoms passed after two days, and I thought nothing more of it.The second time I used the smoker I made salmon. Again, amazing flavor and I am very happy to have this smoker for what it does to food. However, same cold-like symptoms set in by morning. My house smells of smoke two days later, and I now have every window open to air out the house (luckily I'm in Southern California). The cold-like symptoms are fading, and I have no doubt they are caused by the smoke in the house.I plan to continue to use the smoker, but it will have to be outside on the barbecue grill.As far as the product itself, it is really easy to clean and can go into the dishwasher. The burn marks from the wood don't wash out, but that's to be expected. It's overall very sturdy feeling and well constructed, except it's not as air-tight as they claim. I think it will hold up well on the grill."
403130,1,"I've used this knife to field dress, skin and field quarter 4 white tails.Pros:*Prying the ball and socket hip joints is a breeze, with no knife damage.*Comes out of the box sharp enough for duty, but (see Cons)*Good grip and comfortable. Doesn't slip when covered in sticky deer blood*Heavy blade spine...this means it doesn't bend when prying...a good thing...but also makes it less than ideal for cutting out backstraps next to the spine...but good enough if you are careful.*American madeCons:*'Appears' to be a hollow ground blade...great out of the box, but not for long-term resharpening. Simple edge would be better.*Blade edge deforms if used for any hacking on bone. Recommend hatchet or bone saw for this dutyAs with any butchering, expect to sharpen the edge continuously. I use a pull sharpener, and have to clean the muck off the edge and sharpen about 6-10 times per carcass.I gave this blade a 5 star despite cons, as it is the best blade I've found for the price point."

It is very easy to switch from rocker to push handle. Even my 5 year old could figure it out. The only bad part is that it tips easy with the handle on it. My son tipped it over and scabbed his nose. Overall we are happy with it and think it is a great first trike."
218944,0,"This product is a bit puzzling. i got this product today, and the picture on the sides of the box show the product (black) that was actually in the box, the front shows a product (forest green) that has the two inflow/outflow faucets side-by-side on the top base of the pump, and the Amazon pic (black) shows another pump that that has one faucet on the top base and one faucet on the bottom base. It does say on the box (on all sides) that ""Product design may vary."" (see submitted pics)The one that I received has the in/out openings in the middle of the handle, so right between where your thumbs would be. This means that every time you pump, the hose also moves up and down with it. Not a very good design. Mine also did not have foam (as the Amazon pic seems to have) on the handlebar.I specifically got this pump as an alternative to the pump that came with theGreatland Air Bed with Pump - Blue (Queen), which is rechargeable, but must be charged prior to use - it canNOT be used WHILE charging, which means that you have to plan about 3-4 hours ahead at least, for it to charge enough to inflate a queen sized bed.The problem is that the adapters that are included with this Coleman pump do not have one that will fit the Target bed. I was somewhat misled when I saw on Amazon that some people who bought the Target brand beds also bought this pump, leading me to believe that it was compatible. The largest diameter (basically without using any of the adapters) that this pump can fit into is 1"". The Target bed has an inner diameter of 1 1/4"". I ended up getting a vinyl tube, with inner diameter 1"" and outer diameter 1 1/4"" and it does an OK job of fitting my Target beds.I can sympathize with some of the other reviewers when they say that this pump is very difficult to use -- just consider, that the smaller the opening/tube/hole, the harder it is to pump, right? I used this pump to pump up my twin and queen Target air beds, (so, an inner diameter of 1"") and it wasn't all that easy. Not enough to break a sweat, but not exactly a walk in the park (for reference, I'm about 6', 200 pounds, fairly fit). The adapters included range from 1/8"" to 9/16,"" and you'll be straining a lot more when you use these.Timewise, the rechargeable pump (so, battery-powered) that came with the bed can inflate a twin in about 30 sec. I have another electric pump that runs off 120V, and it inflates it in 15 sec. The pump takes me about a minute.The pump itself is made of fairly rugged plastic, and should last. It's not a smooth operating machine like other pumps that are more for high pressure/low volume. There will be some leakage and lack of efficiency. So even if it does leak a little over time, it should still do the job of inflating low pressure/high volume inflatables."

27973,0,"Great styling and mechanically sound watch. However, the minute counter on the chronograph function (9 o'clock sub dial) is difficult to use; there are only a count of seven minute markers between each ten minute block. For example, between the ""10"" and the ""20"" of the minute counter, there are only seven dots to mark the current minute. At five-minute intervals, it isn't so difficult, but at minute counts of three or seventeen minutes, for example, it's hard to say if four minutes have passed, or eighteen minutes have passed, respectively. Overall I like the watch for telling time, but the chronograph function has critical limits that should be considered before making a purchase."

113787,2,"I purchased the 102S model based on (i) the Company's reputation and (ii) the reviews from Amazon customers. This looked good when the product arrived, it was properly packaged and free from damage. This a very intuitive product and this is necessary as the instructions packed with the product are marginal at best. Things went well until I went to adjust the top strap - the lever on the clamp broke off with just the slightest pressure. This of course made any adjustment impossible.Upon examination it was evident that the quality of the metal used in the clamp was not sufficient for the purpose intended. The quality of the metal reminded me of that used in some of the cheap products that were imported after WWII. This problem was apparently not unexpected as I saw that one other customer reported it and when I called Allen they treated it without any expression of surprise an in fact they sent me two of the clamps an indication that I should expect a repeat of this problem.The rack itself shows evidence of good engineering and reasonable workmanship which is a credit to the founder Dick Allen. My contact at the company was Alex Allen would is apparently in charge and frankly was not impressive. I suspect that this product has, and continues to undergo a ""cost reduction"" analysis that has resulted in the inferior clamps that can break at any time. One has to wonder what will be next? When a product breaks ""out of the box"" and the replacement part is no better than the one that broke it does not instill confidence.This was a good product at a fair price IF the quality of the parts are not diminished. I am concerned that the current product does not represent a good value as a result of what I see as a deterioration in quality - Buyer BewareAllen 102S Premium 2-Bike Trunk Mount Rack"

Got replacement through Do-All as indicated in the original instructions, no problems it just took another 10 days. New unit required some tweaking, had to take off a slider plate and file off a few rough spots and replace some of the cheap bolts and hardware I stripped while reassembling. Main motor gear was slipping and required realignment and tightening. Unit works great now I have completely reassembled it. Go over unit with a fine tooth comb tightening bolts and realigning moving parts before you use it - you will be better off for it. Its a low end automatic unit but value for money, the next best models cost several hundred dollars more and I (a casual shooter) couldn't justify spending more money. You will also need a battery (deep cycle) and I placed it permanently on a garden cart because the thing is unwieldy and heavy, not to mention moving the battery around.

The bite valve was a nice feature especially in the gym> I especially loved that I could throw this in my purse and it wouldn't spill (it is a little big, but it is nice none the less) HOWEVER I have been using the bottle without the bite valve for at least two months with no problem, then all of a sudden water just starts leaking out of the top of the straw (it would only come out when the straw was out, not bent into the lid). Just a few minutes ago (which inspired me to write this review out of frustration) I opened the straw up and water gushed out like old faithful, all over my lap and down my dress. Needless to say I am not a happy camper about it right now.I am hoping that it has something to do with the weather being quite warm and the bottle being moved from my warm car to inside and air conditioned building that has my bottle all leaky (and the pressure in and outside the bottle at dis-equilibrium). Maybe I need to put the bite valve back on..? I am not sure. Tonight I am putting the bite valve back to see if that helps. In the meantime this bottle only gets 3 stars from me."

363544,1,"Powerblocks are very ingenious, instead of having a bunch of dumbbells lying around taking up space, you have a pair that you select the weight you want. At first glance the square design seems a little odd, but have no fear they are very functional and comfortable. The price does seem high, but if you were to buy all the dumbbells powerblocks replaces you would spend more. Don't be fooled by imitations, powerblocks are the original and the best. They are also ""Made In The USA"" which is nice to see nowadays. A few things to be aware of. The blocks need to be on a flat level surface to properly insert the pins. If you have extra cash they do sell a stand. Before you invest make sure you choose the right model, think of future expansion as far as weight goes. Not all models are expandable. All in all I'm very happy with the Poweblocks."

51301,1,"Computer failed and had to be replaced at 2 yrs and about 300 hours of use. Had to use the bike shop (where purchased) to look at the unit and they were able to get a replacement part from Nautilus, Inc. Total cost for the repair came to over $200 - which seems a little pricey for only a little over 26 mos of use, especially since it's about 50% the price of a new one.Try finding the part number for the computer ....FYI - the part this week is Nautilus p/n 25059 and is named a Console - made in China, of course, and fits both the 103 and 203 -LIKES: extremely quiet, easy to use, can watch/do/be in the room with others doing TV/paperwork/conversation ... etc. I like to set the heart rate and the computer does the rest to keep up with stepping the resistance to keep it at the same rate. This function works well, however it would be nice to have a selectable lower 'step up rate' from the start as sometimes at the 4 to 6 minute mark will be very difficult while attempting to get the heart rate up, and can be almost extra strain to the knees at this point. But, once the heart rate gets to pace, riding for the rest of workout is very well done.The unit is very robust and stable when using, and hence the heavy mass to accomplish it is appreciated.DISLIKES: Magnets will rattle at times, Heart monitor sometimes gets lost and then under/over shoots your heart rate setting. Purchasing parts can be a challenge outside the channels of a specialized bike shop.MAJOR DISLIKE: Had a 2 yr expensive computer (replacement) failure. If it should fail again, it will be history. Did not find that anyone else has reported failures other than initial shipment problems, so I might have just been the 1 in a million to get one that would fail.Feel free to contact me (Nautilus, Schwinn, etc.. ) if you would desire.

367178,0,"This is an update to an earlier, one-star review.Unfortunately, I live in a part of the country where no matter how clean you keep your house and no matter how carefully you seal up food or anything else that could attract ants, you will end up with ants in your apartment/house during certain times of the year.I used to use this brand of ant trap regularly. They worked great. Now, apparently the formula has changed (apparently due to government regulations? I'm not sure) and these traps just don't work as well anymore. However, they do seem to work. It seems you just have to be patient.I put these down because I saw some ants -- not a trail or a huge number or anything, but enough to be irritating -- in a corner of my apartment. At first I rarely even saw ants going into the actual trap. They were attracted to the trap, but didn't actually go into it, which seemed to make the traps essentially worthless. I put the rest of the traps around different areas of my apartment and nothing much seemed to happen. I was about to go buy another type of trap.Then, I noticed that there were fewer ants around ... so I thought, well, perhaps these are working, just very slowly.Then, one day, after it got rather cold outside, I came home and saw that the trap I'd laid down in the original corner was just *covered* with ants and they were dutifully going into the trap, coming out, and then trudging back to their colony (wherever it is). I noticed that two other traps I'd laid were also attracting ants in a similar fashion, but in much smaller numbers.So, finally, the traps seem to be working. I will update this review again in a few days, because by then, I hope all the ants will be gone.Bottom line: It seems like you have to be patient with these traps. If you only have a few ants to begin with, it may take a while for the ants to start feeding on these traps."

Not really an ""extra-wide"" chair. The chair's description says ""extra-wide"" but I am a middle sized man but I can barely fit in this chair. I am wondering why they call this chair an ""extra-wide?"" Honestly, more like a small-middium sized chair. Even the back support only touches up to my lower back.2. The mounting plate came with this chair but there are not screws or bolts in the package. How am I supposed to mount this chair? Tie it down with a rope or something? Also, the mounting plate is made with PVC or something (not metal) but the thread inside the holes are made with metal and I don't think it's stainless steel. So beware if you want to mount this chair on a ocean purpose boat(s). Don't be fooled by ""mounting plate set!"" They should note that ""no hardware included.""3. Not very comfortable than I expected.4. There are some grey colored finger marks on the plastic white chair (not very pretty)5. Some permanent marks on the back rest cushion (they packed together with armrest cushion and backrest together, thus left imprinted marks onto the backrest, very disappointing).This chair can be very comfortable for a 5 year old child. If you are an adult and preparing to use this chair as a captain's chair on your boat, look somewhere else.The true value for this chair in my personal oppinion.... is $45 including free shipping."

279766,1,"I used this bed myself for 2 weeks while my mother was visiting. It inflates quickly and stays inflated during use. I felt like I was sleeping on my own bed.

183251,2,"If you are a masochist and enjoy finding your 2000 odd steps reset back to under a hundred several times a day then go-ahead and buy this - you will be transported to ecstasy on a regular basis.For anyone concerned about things that might rile them enough to put their blood-pressure up may I suggest they avoid this product? After a day of use I feel sure this product had to have been designed by someone who suffered a deep personal dislike of anyone trying to get fit.Putting a highly sensitive and huge reset button on the front was NOT a good idea, not even a half-good idea.Heaven forbid that you dare to bend over when wearing it, put a coat on, brush against a work surface, or even dare to drop your trousers when you need to to meet a call of nature. Any one of these actions, plus a multitude more will cause it to reset back to 0.You can slightly overcome this reset problem by cutting the strong plastic packaging up, (which BTW must have been designed by someone else as it is tough and does it job) and taping a bit of the strong plastic over the reset button, ( Sadly this vital information does not come in the instructions.)This is the first pedometer I have ever bought, and won't be the last as I'm going to look for one that has tested in real-life and not just via a computer screen.I am giving it one star. This as you might guess is not for the pedometer itself but for the little book about fitness that came with it that is really quite good."

210128,1,"This is my fourth pair of Maui Jim sunglasses, and the second pair with glass lenses. I have become a firm believer in glass lenses because they offer a clearer, crisper, and overall superior lens compared to polycarbonate. It is a fact that MJ lenses are the best in the industry, and MJ is still an independent company which makes its own frames and lenses. Many other brands are owned by Luxottica, and it's not so clear cut where frames, lenses, or final assembly originate from. With Maui Jim, it is either Japan or Italy. The fit and finish on these glasses is typical of Maui Jim, which is to say excellent. The temples of these Stingrays are rather wide which help to block more sun light from getting into your eyes, but they also block peripheral vision so be aware of that especially when driving. They are very lightweight which makes them really comfortable to wear all day. These glasses come with a semi hard ""sport"" case, I would prefer a hard clam shell case. Overall, this is yet another home run for Maui Jim, and thanks to their superior products and designs, another dent in my wallet. An absolutely top notch product. Made in Italy."

The screw hole used to attach the threaded mount to the rifle were not drilled perpendicular to the cylinder of the threaded mount, which created an uneven surface, resulting in an inability to use it to mount the bipod to any rifle. I had to use a grinder to compensate for the non-perpendicular hole for the screw in order to get a flush mount. Very poor quality control. Disappointed."

500784,0,"I got a 12 decks of these a while back and was satisfied at first with them. However, if you do any kind of card manipulation or card magic, you will find these unsatisfactory. They have an interesting finish that seems to grab dirt as soon as they our out of the box. After about ten minutes of handling, they will not fan well anymore, and they don't ribbon spread well at all. Certain sleights become far to obvious with these. I also play poker and I suppose if all you do is play cards, you may not have any issues with these. The price looks good, but when you tack on shipping it quickly adds up. I would recommend going to your local Costco and picking up some Bicycles for about the same price."

I contacted TMAS and they were very understanding, and, no questions asked, sent me a new pair of shoes the next day! I did not expect this kind of response and was very pleased. I received the shoes two days later. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE."

434897,1,"My fellow backpacker friend scoffed at me when I told him I bought a thermarest pillow, but to me, resting my head on a comfortable pillow and not a rolled up jacket (or my backpack) is worth its weight in gold! I wake up with a happy head and no knots in my neck. It makes the camping experience that much better. I wish it would compress down more than it does (I have a medium and it compresses down to the size of a large loaf of bread. It does take some time to fill out, so make sure to unroll it as soon as you make camp so it has adequate time to fluff up."

507910,1,"We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old. She never had a tricycle before this 2-wheel with training wheels. She was SO excited when she received it, even though she was not quite coordinated enough to ride it initially. It is a high quality, heavy bike - but its design allows her to get on it without help and we don't worry about her hurting herself on a 'top tube' (the highest bar on the main bike frame) or get clothes stuck in the chain (great chain guard on all sides). Less than six weeks later, she is able to pedal it by herself. Sometimes she gets stuck and asks for help, but we encourage her to stand on the tallest pedal and she is able to get 'un-stuck' by herself. (Read: it's not too heavy a bike). I LOVE the brightly colored paint scheme (that it is not gender-stereotyped princessy or the like)."

257029,1,"I vividly remember the first time I rode my bike without training wheels. I rode straight for about three houses; then, in the middle of an intersection, my bike spun around five times and threw me to the ground. (Hey, that's what it felt like, and my friends all agreed: five times!) I suppose avoiding that kind of learning experience was what prompted me to look into riding ""assistants.""I read the reviews and thought the Balance Buddy sounded like a great idea. My 3-year-old has aCars 12-Inch Boys BMX Bike by Huffyand he's just starting to want to ride it. The BB was easy to put on, but seemed (despite all the reviews talking about how it allows you to walk upright) a little short. I'm 6 feet tall and extended to its longest position, the BB is just about at my fingertips. It does move up and down (pivots at the axle) so that's helpful. The bike is only a 12-incher, so obviously the BB would be an easier reach on a larger bike.At first my son didn't want me to have anything to do with his riding; he would only let the 8-year-old neighbor boy ""push"" him. After a couple of days, though, he allowed me to help him ride. He switches back and forth between training wheels and the Balance Buddy, which might not be a good thing, as he has a tendency to lean over onto the training wheels. I can't seem to get across to him that balancing straight up is the goal. Plus when he rides his attention is on everything but what he's doing, so I'm sure that steepens the learning curve. We'll keep at it and see how he does. He's the next to the last kid in the neighborhood with training wheels and I'd like to see him out with the bigger boys.Update: My son is now five and too big for his bike, but before we got him a bigger bike I wanted him to be able to ride without training wheels. He kept arguing for the training wheels and I countered with the Balance Buddy; in the end I took the BB off and let him coast down the driveway. On the second trip, he started pedaling and we haven't looked back. Today we put him on a 16"" bike. I still like the idea of the Balance Buddy, and I think that it helped somewhat, but in my case it wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped. As always, your mileage may vary."

170846,2,"We had used the same tent for many, many years and thought it was time for a bigger tent. We bought this tent to better fit the family on our last camping trip. To our surprise when we tried to set it up, the grommet and tab that connects the pole to the ground was missing on one of the four corners. Also missing was the tab and grommet to stake down one of the mud porch flaps. We rigged the pole to our vehicle using some spare rope and used a rock to hold down the mud porch. It seemed ingenuity might keep the tent upright, but then a tab that was sewn onto the tent detached. We ended up fitting the whole family in the bed and cab of the truck for the night. We took down the tent and stowed the items in the carrying bag, hoping the experience with the tent would be over. Not quite. The seam on the bag now has a hole! The tent is tall and roomy but terrible for the wind. This is the worst quality I have seen in any product in a very long time. It'll be returned today."

It's very frustrating for him to constantly have to stop to reload. O.k., I guess, for outdoors play, but it's too loud for in the house."

We have two little ones, my son is 2 1/2 and my daughter is 3 1/2.My hubby and I each purchased one for our bikes and he LOVES it, he couldn't be happier, I on the other hand was pretty dissapointed.My knees just kept hitting the seat, and like some other reviewers had written, due to the seats position on my bike, I had to peddle with my legs spread waaay out, and lets face it, I just felt very odd doing that, not to mention uncomfortable,....and I looked pretty goofy doing it as well. :) I enjoy riding my bike, and putting this seat on it made me not enjoy it so much.I SO wanted to love this product, especially since my husband makes his ride look so effortless when he rides with our son or daughter. There is no leg spreadin' going on for him. :) I was very attracted to the idea of our children being seated in front - just the idea of something different I suppose. :)This seats harness was just basic, nothing spectacular. The time it took to put it on both bikes was not long at all, less than a half hour. Very easy to do. The seat itself was very sturdy.I will be purchasing a rear seat as I think that will be the better fit for me, but I must add that while this product may have not worked for me I still think it is a very nice quality seat for the price. My children are very comfortable and happy in it and they enjoy riding in it so much! They'll just have to take turns with who will ride in front with Dad and who will ride in back with Mom. :)"

This is a summer kayak only and you will get wet. I would never take this boat in cold water..The kayak does not propel through the water as quickly as a fiberglass o r plastic one does... You have to paddle twice as hard as others who are in non inflatable boats..Also, I had the same problem as others when trying to get a wet boat back into the bag.This kayak is much cheaper than the plastic and fiberglass ones in the stores...

I chose the free delivery and was expecting to wait for the total three weeks it said it could possibly take but after I ordered on tuesday I had my bike on friday. Assembly was simple, I did it while watching Jeramiah Johnson starring Robert Redford, and shortly into the movie I was riding my bike instead of assembling it. It has a lot of good features especially for the price, and the only problem is with the useless fan and I wish the control screen was angled slightly different, all in all it is a quality product and I am very pleased."
136918,0,"The problem with these is that the liner inside fits in a way that the crotch of the exterior of the shorts rides really low, and creates an unattractive pouch in the front, like you are hiding some kind of accident in your pants. I don't know about you, but when I spend money on workout clothes, I expect them to be functional, but I don't think it's too much to expect them not to look weird. Other than this, the quality of the materials is great, so if you by chance have a body type that can wear these a bit better, I would recommend trying them on in the store first to make sure, which unfortunately kind of defeats the convenience of online shopping."

This source provides a sufficient length so that I don't have to re-order for a long time."
139712,0,"First, it is indeed pretty flimsy. Important to note is that the canvas roof is actually structural and holds the flimsy metal frame together.

99166,2,"After almost 20 years of trekking, backpacking and mountaineering, I decided to hang up my trusty mule of a pack, the Lowe Alpine Contour IV, and splurge on a comfortable load master, the Gregory 95 (large).I packed it for a 10 trip to knock out 5 14ers (and a few 13ers) in the Sawatch Range of Colorado.When I pulled it out of the Eagle Creek XXL duffle in Denver, I noticed the plastic in the hip belt was snapped.What that meant was for the entire time we were backpacking to basecamp, my heavy load (60+lb) was pinched into my shoulders.I don't know if it cracked during transit, or if I missed the crack in the store (as some other reviewers have noted that these packs often come defective).Additionally, just through normal usage on one trip, the fabric has several rips, punctures and tears. It seems delicate. I didn't notice any stitching blow-outs, but will watch (as other reviewers have noted on different back country sites) for that since it seems to be common.I guess that they don't make them like they used to. I have contacted Gregory and am waiting for a return authorization.In the meanwhile, for my upcoming winter trip, I am pulling out the trustworthy Lowe Alpine instead.Sadly, I had always heard that Gregory's were the top of the line in comfort and durability, and for the price they charge, you would expect that.Be very cautious if you are looking at an extended trip with more than 40lb loads, have a backup plan in case it fails far from civilization."

They wash easily. The drawstring hasn't given me any trouble with coming loose in the washing machine. I really don't like drawstring pants that have loose strings. So I like these and will watch to see if and when they go on sale again. Mine are in navy and they haven't faded."

176812,1,"Purchased this knife from Amazon and the day after it arrived I had the opportunity to field dress a smallish boar (115 lbs). I had put my own edge on the knife so it was a razor. I love the handle of this knife we had a light rain falling and the grip on the knife is very easy to hold with no slipping. I don't find the knife handle to large at all. I was able to split the rib cage with a couple of easy pulls through the ribs, no need for a saw.After we had the hog hanging up my 16 year old daughter skinned the hog with this knife and she had no problems with the grip either. In fact the blade design on this knife is the best skinning knife I've ever used. Because it has a very large curved blade it works extremely well to remove the hide. The steal also holds an edge very well. My friend who has always been a folding hunter knife fan all his life was so impressed with the knife ordered one Amazon the next day. I'm purchasing another knife for each of my daughters. This is a great heavy blade knife with wonderful curved blade for skinning."

352462,1,"I did a lot of searching for a watch to wear every day. I have some expensive watches that I try not to wear to work to preserve them. I liked the idea of the G-Shock but I found there were too many combinations and I could'nt decide on a model. After a lot of thought it came down to two thigs for me. The strap style band and the least amount of gadgets. At work, I dont need to know the altitue or which was north is from my desk, or the barometric pressure. All of these things and more are usefull to some people but not me. I love this watch for its simplicicty, size and looks. Buckle style bands never seem to fall in the correct hole for my wrist size, they are either too tight or too loose and I didn't want another stainless band this time. No regrets at all."

116329,1,"So my new Sigma arrived in the mail yesterday, which was pretty quick and with free shipping! Anyway, this thing was a breeze to install. I left the instruction book alone and just went to youtube and there is a video there made by Sigma (I think) that shows you very simply how to install it. It's not this particular model, but it's exactly the same installation. I had it installed in about 10 minutes because I had to spend a few extra minutes figuring out how I wanted to route the wire down my bike and the fork. Then I broke out the book and watched another video on how to measure the size of your wheel/tire. I used the tried and true ""roll out method"" which can be done a few different ways. Either lay a measuring tape (one that has mm on it was well as inches) on the floor, mark a spot on your wheel or tire and simply roll the wheel around one revolution. Then calculate how many millimeters. Simple. The other way is to put a chalk line (thin one) on the actual tire, take it outside and roll it a few revolutions and then measure the distance between chalk marks on the ground. Again, simple. The computer was easy to program, and unlike a few other reviewers, I like the fact that each feature can be reset individually. What if I got up to 50mph on a downhill and wanted to show that off to someone? Anyway, great bang for the buck. Super easy install, fits very securely to the bike, and was well worth the money."

508950,0,The bayonet seems to be made of good material but it is a bit hard to attach and detach to the bayonet lug. I didn't find this out until after having to have the barrel hole drilled bigger as it won't fit over theAR-15 larger flash suppressor. The sheath is not of high quality but for the money this is a reasonable buy.
79780,1,"Just to start off, i should say that i am not really a 'hardcore' cyclist. If you're the kind of person who can put an entire bike together from memory, or the kind of person who commutes every day on a 900$ road bike and always wears spandex, your level of commitment and bicycle knowledge is probably years ahead of mine. I know enough to be able to name all the parts on my bike and do light maintenance, but i don't ride every single day, i don't tour, and i find road bikes kind of intimidating.All that said, i like this rack a lot so far. It fit perfectly fine on my hybrid bike. I have a step-through frame, so the top of the rear tyre is actually several cm higher than the bosses on the seat stays, so i did have to bend the little rods on the front of the rack down quite a bit to get them to reach. But it's fine, it just requires a little effort; if i can do it, anyone can.This might be self-explanatory, but just in case it's not, i do have one tip regarding those rods: If you do have to bend them, bend them only as much as you need to to get the holes on the rods to line up with the holes on the seat stays. Don't try to get it perfect, just keep it in place with one hand and use the other one to screw it on. The tightening of the screws will easily bend the rods the rest of the way.Other than that, installation is pretty straight-forward. The instructions were kind of confusing to me at first because they're in a dozen languages, but actually there are only four or five steps. Partially screw the rods onto the rack, then screw the rack to the drop-outs, then bend the rods and/or screw them to the seat stays. You can then optionally install a rear light mount on the back of the rack. All the screws are standard hex bolts (i think #5 but i'm not positive), except for the one that attaches the light mount (it's a Phillips).As far as quality and usability, i've only recently got 'serious' about bikes, so i don't have experience with any other racks. But from my experience just with this one, i'd say it's pretty good. I use aTopeak MTX Trunk Bag EXwith my rack, and i have no complaints. There is a 'foot' on the bottom of the bag that slides into the rails on the bike rack, which holds the bag down and prevents it from moving side to side. Then there is a clip on the front of the bag that clamps down on the bar at the front end of the rack, which keeps it from sliding off the back. It seems very secure and there is almost zero movement.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a rear rack. My only disclaimer is, again, what i said at the beginning -- i'm not a hardcore cyclist and i don't know much about the things that they'd be likely to worry about, like weight and carrying capacity. But for the average person at least i think it's great."
204799,0,This thing works. You will feel it right away in your butt and thighs. It does take time to get a rythm going because its really hard to keep your balance. I finally decided to wrap my exercise bands under it and hold onto them for balance. This made a Huge difference and now I put the stepper to good use.

98192,1,"I had the gloves for about couple of months now and they're still in great shape. There might be other gloves out there that go for a little bit less, but if you dont mind spending this much, then go for it. It's money well spent, at least for me that is."
284304,1,"As others have noted, the pictures don't do this watch justice. I brought it to the jeweler to have a few links removed, and when he caught the subtle iridescence of the black mother of pearl face, he exclaimed, ""Wow, this is a nice watch! How much did you pay for it?"" This from a man wearing an $8,000 Omega dive watch.From a design standpoint, Invicta pro diver series are as close to being knock-offs of the Rolex submariner series as they can be without inviting a lawsuit for trademark infringement. This one looks pretty similar to some stainless/gold Rolex designs, but with rectangular hour markers instead of dots. I don't care for flashy watches, I prefer the utilitarian stainless with black and white dial look, but I was looking for a watch with day and date and an automatic movement. Because I wanted to wear it every day, it had to be cheap enough that I wouldn't mind it getting beat up. This watch fits the bill, but is actually a bit nicer than I wanted. I'm going to be sad when it's all beat up, but hey, I only paid a hundred bucks for it, and nobody in his right mind is going to examine this thing through a jeweler's loupe when it's sitting on my wrist.From a performance standpoint, I really have only one complaint, which is that the second hand does not stop when you pull out the crown. That means any talk about the watch being accurate to seconds per month is silly, since you can't really synchronize the watch that precisely. Users of cheap quartz watches will be surprised by this, but apparently lack of this ""hacking"" feature is fairly common in mechanical watches.Somebody complained this watch only has four hours of reserve power; I can only guess he did not follow the manual's advice and wind it up every several weeks. After winding it up it for the first time it has not run out of power, even when I've left it on my bureau overnight and into the afternoon. Others have complained the face was too small. It's a normal sized watch, and I can't see any functional reason for it to be any bigger. I guess it's a matter of the fashion message you want to send. This watch doesn't have tons of dials and crowns and complications, it's about utility with understated elegance.One pleasant surprise is the luminescent markings. At first I set it next to a cheap quartz analog and was distressed when it was not nearly as bright. But very quickly cheap quartz watch dimmed, and this one kept going. The luminescent hands on this watch remains readable all night provided your eyes are fully dark adapted. Unfortunately it's not nearly bright enough to read while you are driving at night, which would be nice, but I'm not sure whether even most tritium watch faces would be readable under those conditions. On this watch you can easily see the hour and minute hands after hours in darkness. The hour markings and second hand aren't quite as bright but after a few seconds you can make them out too. The trickiest thing to see is the zero marker on the bezel. If you really need that, you can put the watch under a light for a minute or so and you should be able to discern that too all night.It appears that Invicta has discontinued this watch, although the all gold tone version is still available. That's a shame because it's a nice looking, utilitarian watch that's not so expensive you have to fret over it. If you are looking for an affordable automatic watch with a day/date calendar, this is it."
175026,0,"We live on a cliff overlooking the city. We bought this to watch the firetrucks, police, and other goings-on below us. It works great for that purpose as long as you don't zook all the way in. The biggest issue I have had is figuring out how to mount this to the deck rail. There isn't a good ready made device for that purpose so I had to design my own. Really pleased with what I have now."

308888,0,I sent this air mattress to my adult sons to use while they were in between roommates and apartments. They said it was too high and they occaisionally rolled off during the night. They preferred the Aerobed air mattress which they already owned and which was 2 years old.
3179,1,"My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US. I, myself, am not a great runner or trainer (I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts) so I was satisfied with a 6$ shirt I found at Old Navy. My roommate, instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words ""buy this for me"" and adding the link, decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt, from which (after summing up what he had written) I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike. He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma, so I cannot add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago, I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited. Footnote: he was also excited by my 6$ shirt and is also very excited about making rice and veggies for dinner and our upstairs neighbor, which in my opinion, is o.k looking at best. This brings to one of two conclusions: 1. My roommate is easily excited. 2. I am a poor judge of people's emotions.In the three days since, he has worn this shirt on a total of 13 different occasions.In conclusion - my roommate seems pleased with this shirt. I am not as pleased since it is very tight on the body and his preferred choice of pants to wear with the shirt is... well... none. I urge you to try and NOT imagine a 30 y/o bulky man of Georgian decent in a tight top and briefs walking around your apartment...In any case, I will report back if he starts walking about with a frown on his face or ending text messages with "":("".It seems like a good purchase.Matan"

181333,1,"I've been shopping around for an affordable automatic diver's watch for some time. I've done my research on Casios, Seikos, and others. I found a lot of people highly recommending the Invicta brand. I was lucky enough to find this model under $70 on an Amazon sale. After owning this timepiece, I would gladly pay full retail if I had to do it again.The bracelet fells very solid, and polished to a high gloss. The only drawback is the constant grease and fingerprints aquired through use, a minor complaint. The bezel does rotate, but serves no purpose outside of asthetics. The weaving pattern is very flattering. Attention grabbing like lesser watches that have the fake diamonds around the face, but not nearly as tacky, in my opinion. Around the bold numbers is the military equivilant of 1300, 1400, etc. The face is not nearly as yellow as the diagram dipicts. It seems to be a more lighter champagne than yellow in indoor lighting. The backing is also mineral crystal, common in automatic watches so you can see the interior mechanism.The automatic movement is amazingly smoothe. Watching the second hand move, it maintains a very steady tic. I've witnessed other cheap auto movements that are jittery and inconsistant resulting in constant loss of time. This is not the case with the Invicta. The sweep maintains integrity while moving forward. This quality is hard to find in most ""bargain"" automatic watches.Overall, I am very pleased with my investment. It might not be an Omega or Rolex, but it looks great, accurate, and well worth the money paid for it."
230275,2,"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR WIFE TO HIT YOUR UPS DELIVERY GUY WITH A BROOM.I purchased the Eclipse because of the reviews on Amazon - mostly they indicated that the machine worked great, but would break after two years of daily use. This I can live with. Heck, if an exercise machine isn't a rack for partially-dirty clothing at this point and I've put in 800 hours of sweat and blood into it, it's still far cheaper than joining an exercise club.So, I put it together. Assembly was easy. My eight year old and I slapped the thing together with a minimum amount of cussing. He knows I don't like him cussing.My son was particularly happy about the included water bottle. For some reason he has a minor obsession with them. Hydration is his mantra.I put my exercise togs on and started ellipticising, or whatever you call it. I set the timer for 40 minutes, and made it through 35 minutes of silent sweeaty cardio. The silent part is nice, because my wife is a writer and comes out and hits me with a broom if I make too much noise.5 minutes left, right? Then the thing started making a horrendous clunking on the downstep on the right side. My thoughts? Maybe it's left handed. In order to avoid making my wife angry and getting her broom out, I stopped.The next day, I called customer service. They indicated that the part to replace was a little bearing. They'd ship it out in 7-10 days. Hmm, I get to pay to repair the thing on the first go 'round, after one excercise session?So, I waited.Bearing shows up. I don't know what they feed the people who tighten the bolts on these things in China, but they must have bulging arms and tendons of rippling steel. I finally got the bearing off, and replaced it.The thunking stayed, and my wife re-emerged with her broom. I hit the Amazon website, furiously re-packed the Eclipse in the original shipping container, and *poof* a UPS man appeared immediately to whisk it away, muttering that he hated lifting three hundred pound boxes. My wife hit him with the broom and he stopped whining.No, I'm not getting another Eclipse, but whatever I do buy will be from Amazon.Jeff Bezos, you still rock."
237011,1,"I initially purchased four of these wide mouth 32 oz. Nalgene loop top bottles to be used by my family and me when we go for walks and/or exercise. We find we now use them throughout the day as our regular drinking receptacles. We are all health conscious individuals who are trying to drink the recommended amount of water for our activity levels. I like that the measurement markers on these bottles allow us to keep track of our fluid intake and make it easy to do so. We fill them with filtered water and have never noticed a change in taste of any kind.I am also pleased that these bottles are very easy to clean and re-use. I haven't put them in the dishwasher yet only because it's been convenient to hand wash them for re-use.We like these bottles so well that I have ordered quite a few more to give to various family members. I did order smaller sizes for young ones in the family and am looking forward to reviewing those as well.I am very happy with my purchase and recommend this product to anyone who wants a reusable container without worrying about chemicals leaching into their beverages and that is easy to take wherever you go, to use, and to clean."

117257,0,"the pad is not included like it shows in the picture. You can purchase them directly from the ibert website for around $9 including shipping. The hex key was missing from my box but I have a bike tool so it wasn't a huge deal but if you didn't have one, it would be very frustrating. It won't fit on every bike. It fits on mine but does not fit my husband's bike. The WeeRide wouldn't fit either of our bikes. Assembly was a snap. I give it a zero stars for comfort...hard slick plastic. I can only imagine she will get hot and sweaty sticking to it. It feels a little wobbly when my daughter isn't in it and rattles. I still like it better than having her in the back. I think it's very over priced and especially having to spend more to get a pad...that should be included. I won't be riding with the seat off and stinger attached...it looks like it could really hurt someone. It's not hard to take off and put back on, just risk scratching up your spacers every time. I will probably put tape under it to protect the bike a little. I think it's a good idea and like someone else said, we're basically paying for the idea because there really isn't anything to this seat. I would have given it another star or two if the pad came with it like it shows in the picture. The fact that I have to go to their site and order it is irritating. It should not be an accessory. I would have liked to know this ahead of time so I could have ordered them at the same time. It's still cheaper to order from Amazon with free shipping and then go order the pad."

97773,2,"Updated Review: Did they change the description recently to say ""men's""?? I eventually got a small sweatshirt, which is nice and normal in every way (except maybe the puffy sleeves, which aren't very warm). Then my partner bought me another small in a different color and.. Ugh. The 2nd small sweatshirt is very different: absurdly small neck hole, tighter shoulders or ? that makes the sleeves ride up my arms so that the wrist bands feel scratchy and too tight. I suppose for this price you sacrifice quality control.There is no way any human body would fit in the small sweatshirt but have a neck the size of a small boy. It's not like a turtle neck, just very small and tight - ridiculous! So I removed the neck ribbing, and it looks like a new manufacturer spec'd the neck hole for the size WITH the ribbing, as the new ribbing-removed hole is the exact size of the hole of the first sweatshirt WITHOUT ribbing removed. Won't buy one again, and bummed that my new sweatshirt is now raggedy and can't be worn out of the house.----Looking again at the main page for this sweatshirt - it's apparently unisex. The model is a dummy after all. In any case, as a woman who normally wears between a medium and large shirt (have to go larger because of shoulders), I was surprised that the medium sweatshirt is MASSIVE. I should have ordered a small, but I was too enchanted by the softness and beautiful green color to send it back before wearing it. It is even more comfortable than I'd expected, but the sleeves are just too long, and the arm and body areas are huge. I get cold in it unless I wear a long sleeve shirt under it, due to air flow."

The hole view doesn't even show up half the time and the game graphics in general are a joke. In addition, the players responses to shots are inaccurate. You make a putt and the players response is of disappointment. A tap in type putt requires the swing of a 50' putt?? When the putt is missed (or made) the player does this wierd back bend...thing. I'm not even sure the human body could do what they do...at least not without serious injury. Honestly...the entire game is poorly designed and almost unplayable.

92429,0,"I've been using the Gazelle for about a year now. Its a decently-built and space-saving LOW-impact exercise machine. It offers some different motions - sideways, move-forward, kick-backward, slow-and-steady, etc...but like most other cardio machines the movement is one and the same.IMPACT: Let's clear this up. You are not getting the same work-out on the Gazelle as you are on proper machines (elliptical, stepper, treadmill, bike, or even jogging outdoors). Those cost more and take up more space and that's why you're buying a Gazelle in the first place. I use this as a low-impact (IMHO) side workout when I can't get to the gym. But unless you intend to spend hours on this thing each day, you'll need to supplement your cardio with ""real"" cardio.SET-UP/MAINTENANCE: If you're like me and have done the whole IKEA thing, assembly will be about 1-2 hours. Make sure you TIGHTEN everything very well. You'll need to periodically re-tighten and get some WD-40 to minimize squeaking.GRIPES: The battery-operated caloric counter stopped working within a couple of weeks. Add to that the calorie count was so off-the-charts unbelievable that I didn't bother replacing it. I also have hardwood floors and this thing SLIDES across as you're working out. Either you need to have carpeted floor, get a carpet and secure it down, OR do what I do now: I use a small rug and free weight to weight down the machine.STORAGE: You'll need a really high-up bed to be able to slip this baby under there. I usually just prop it up against a wall and don't notice it too much. Fold up the pedals first, those things can pack a punch to your legs!All in all this isn't a bad machine for the money. It helps me to burn some calories but simply can't be the mainstay of my fitness regimen."

498680,1,"I've never used a kit like this before, but I have been a utilitarian type all of my life so I wasn't terribly apprehensive when ordering this. This kit has a very short learning curve in my opinion, and I was able to achieve an amazing result on my very first use. I had a bit of an issue at first when trying to get the knife clamp to hang on to my blade, which is a Benchmade btw, but once I got it adjusted it held on perfectly with no slipping. My blade was only dull and not beat up so I used only the coarse, fine, and ultra fine hones, and I must say, the end result is impeccable. I would say that this product is of excellent value for the price, and I am active duty in the military so I certainly appreciate something like this that lives up to what it advertises to do. I love knives by nature of who I am and I always want to take the best care of my blades and if you are the same way then by all means this is a great product. BTW, I used this in conjunction with the Super ""C"" Clamp; while the clamp isn't necessary and I can see how the kit can be used just fine without it I do feel like it made the entire process more convenient and I definitely say that the clamp is of good value as well."

I also talked with a manager there for about 30 minutes with no luck.When the package showed up I had to refuse delivery, and it went back to the BeachBody shipping warehouse, but they still charged me $13.73 for shipping.Don't order direct from BeachBody's Website!!!"

My 3 stars has more to do with the product description rather than the product itself."
502374,0,"I bought two of these based on a review that said they were inconsistent. The review was spot-on, and I bought them, even knowing I would have a lot of work to do. I have been able to straighten them somewhat by wetting and steaming, and have sanded one to get rid of the knot bumps, and, for the work, they are usable, if not ""performance grade.""I would take the chance again, since for the martial arts I practice (Tai Chi Chuan), spear forms are a high-level exercise. The spears have a heavier point, and these would otherwise be ideal, if they were something thicker. I suppose it counts on how many are in the ""batch"" received from China, and when one buys. I'm still hoping I can get them worked out."

414997,0,"I must say, Patrick is great and the workout is fun and well done, but it is an aerobic workout (a good one), using the ball as a prop, rather than a true ""ball"" workout. I was hoping for a routine that would stretch and strengthen each muscle system, the typical ball exercise fare. This is not that at all. You sit on the ball and bounce A LOT, walk around the ball, carry the ball while you move, or bounce the ball while you move. There are no targeted muscle exercises, its strictly aerobic."

I have a friend who saw that I had the bottle and they asked me if it leaked like theirs did so this bottle isn't just a fluke."
147817,0,"i've used this for about a season, and am a bit disappointed. The zip tie is a bozo way of attaching an accessorie to a bike. How many points of connections are there on your bike, and how many of them are as crude as a zip tie? Also, the wings of the design are largely cantilevered out off of the handlebars and seem to be inviting breakage the first time they get pressed upon or bopped very hard. I probably would not be so dissatisfied except that i have an older style Polar BIke Mount that is a very different design, and vastly superior. I would have returned mine once i got it were it not for the cost of shipping it back."

I traded some messages with an old college friend that was almost done with the 12 week program and had nothing but good things to say. I needed a goal / something to kick my butt. And I found it, It's not a gimmick; not 8 minute abs, not 11 minute insanity work out. Each session is 60 to 90 minutes long. Lots of push ups, sit-ups, pull ups and lunges. No BS .

Too bad; otherwise it's a good bag.Ample room for a deluxe mat and sundries. Solid, smooth metal zipper.

298561,1,"I purchased from another source one year ago this month. Begin having problems with door not unlocking when code entered. You could hear a ""click"" on the lock release, but no open door. I called Gun Vault and that's when I was informed that the power cube is NOT the primary source of power with battery back up. The batteries are primary and the cube back up. I was told to replace the batteries, which I did, although they all test good, and unit is back to normal.I'm not knocking the GV2000C-DLX unit as I use it daily and it serves it's purpose adequately. What I don't like is the fact batteries are not the back up power; the power cube will not work until batteries completely dead; you can't use just the power cube with no batteries according to customer service rep I spoke to; the low battery alarm never sounded indicating batteries were low (my removed batteries all checked good on tester and all were within .23V of the 1.5V and have plenty of life left, just not enough to fire the solenoid that opens GV door); Plus the 5 second light when door opens is basically useless (20-30 seconds would be better). The extra bells and whistles just aren't worth the extra cost IMHO and if I ever replace this DLX unit I will go with the STD instead.I also own a couple of the Nano 300 Mini-Vaults I use in my vehicles with combo locks and highly recommend them. None of the products will prevent a determined thief with proper tools since they are all light gauger steel, but s/he will have to have the time and determination to pry them open or cut the cable on the Nano's. There will be no snatch and run."
434537,1,"I have health problems that make it important to keep my feet happy, and I have searched high and low for the ""right"" socks. In an effort to keep my feet warm I've often resorted to buying thicker men's socks, even though they never fit me quite right. This sock is the best I've found. It's thick but light enough to wear with everyday shoes; sturdy enough to wear for hiking on rough terrain here in the high desert and southern Rockies. Very comfortable -- doesn't bunch up, and it has nice padding in the right spots. I bought it specifically for cold-weather use, and it consistently keeps my feet warm even in temps around zero (Fahrenheit), or on hikes where my feet are likely to get cold and damp. Feels comfortably dry even though I have notoriously sweaty feet.These socks are not cheap, and that made me hesitant to buy them. But I liked the first pair so much, I ended up buying three more. I've tried socks made of everything -- cotton, acrylic blends, wool, bamboo -- and these socks are my current favorites. I hope Thorlo keeps making them, because I intend to buy more in the future."

The seconds are in large numbers while the time is in small. Wish that were reversed. I can see the time; it's just more difficult. But as I said the main reason for purchase was for a silent alarm and I'm very pleased with that."

262069,1,"This gun is awesome. I just got it today and I was so excited. I am only a begginer at airsoft but i can tell this gun rocks. it goes through paper the clips are sturdy, i dropped one on cement and its fine. The silencer is just for looks doesn't do anything and the laser dot scope doesn't zoom. Pretty good rate of fire takes a while for the clip to run out, and to load on you put bbs in a pipe(included) and put it over the mag, then push a pipe through it. it is weighted but not to heavy. the sling is really short and i didn't know how to assemble it. you can see the bbs flying and you can see the difference between the hop up and normal. the 8000 bbs come in 4 bottles of 2000 and are black, they're preety solid but the bottle says ""targer"" and it says if you use any bbs from another campany the gun will have trouble, i don't know if that is true or not. the battery is in the RIS system. the safe switch is kind of hard to move at first so give it a jerk. the safety goggles are good quiality, and big and don't make it blurry. you have to push a saftey button to shoot and you heve to hold it down but thats ok its easy to push. I dont use the electronic scope because it doesnt look cool and i can use the sights. the accurcay is pretty good won't be sniping anyoneI hope you find this review helpful and please excuse my grammer or spelling mistakes.

309526,0,"I bought this spork after shopping around on Amazon and looking at many of the other choices. I finally decided on this particular one due to the relatively high number of positive reviews and the fact that it also includes a bottle opener in the handle. I have not used it yet, nor do I know if I ever will, but that was my reasoning none-the-less. Mostly I just like gadgets, and this definitely qualifies.Rather than go into great detail (this is a relatively simple item, after all) I'll just list a few pros and cons that I have come up with in the past couple of weeks while I have been using this spork almost daily (eating lunch at work).Pros:* Extremely useful - I have used it as both a spoon and a fork and it works great as a spoon, but less so as a fork (more on that below). I noticed very little difference compared to an actual spoon, mainly because it is wide like a soup spoon, rather than long, so the tines don't take too much away from the spoon portion.* Novelty - One of the main reasons I bought this item is because I have always been fascinated by sporks (they were the highlight of Taco Bell when I was a kid), so I have to admit that the novelty of it is a big part of the appeal. Will it wear off eventually? Probably, but it will still be useful so I'm not really concerned about it.Cons:* Made in China and it looks it - poor quality controls throughout. Mine came out of the box with several cosmetic blemishes and casting inconsistencies, none of which detract from the utility of the item, but for a $10 utensil I expected better.* The Clip is all but worthless - As was mentioned in several other reviews, the clip portion is basically useless, I would not use it to clip the spork anywhere it might be lost if it falls off, as it probably will. I removed the clip and discarded it when I received my spork to remove the temptation of trying to use it.Both:* Very Lightweight - The weight is awesome and would be perfect for a camper/backpacker, which is what items like this were designed for, after all. However, as a personal preference, I like beefy utensils that feel indestructible; this item is not one of those. I knew that when I purchased it (titanium, duh) so I can't really count this as a con.* It's a spoon with fork tendencies - the tines are just long enough to get you by; unless you are planning on trying to eat pasta, salad, or a steak. If you need the tines to grip your food you will be frustrated as the ones on this spork are just not long enough for that. Granted, it can be worked around, but it detracts from the utility of the item slightly. For the foods I eat a Foon (more fork than spoon) would probably be better. A complete set of utensils would undoubtably be the best bet, but where is the fun in that?Overall I do not regret buying this item and it has performed as expected. It's lightweight, functional, and the novelty of it actually makes it kinda fun to eat lunch in the break room. Three stars for poor quality control and engineering on the spring clip/bottle opener."

116989,1,"My daughter loves to ride. This seat is easy to install and remove when not in use. The ""Lap Bar"" hinges up for easy loading / unloading. I am 6' tall and was worried about my knees hitting the seat, but that is not a problem.If I had to say something negative, the 2 things I don't like about the seat is; the seat belt, and the ""Lap Bar Latch"".Seatbelt; doesn't secure over Tess' shoulders in the BACK very well and her shoulders keep coming out of it. The slots in the back are a little wide for my small 2yo Tess, and don't adjust smaller.

Loved the overall feel and comfort and cosmetic appeal (its important for all wearing apparel to look good, yes? Smile, yes.) I bought them to replace my very worn Nike's. But, and I really hate to say this, here's the thing. The stitching down between the fingers is incomplete. Between most all the fingers. At first I thought maybe they were made that way, or maybe I just hoped so. But I don't think they are. The failure to fully stitch the leather between the fingers is bothersome, but for my purposes wasn't enough for me to go to the trouble to send them back. I probably should, and most would, and in all honesty, I thought Mizuno had higher quality control standards. Other than that.....smile, yeah, other than that, they are quite nice."

376049,0,"I bought this child seat for my three year old. The assembly took a while and the directions were hard to read. I did finally get seat assembled safety on the back of the bike. I did not find the bike seat to be a sturdy as expected, but it seems to work fine. I really like the handle bars on the front; I have my child climb up to the seat while I hold to handle to balance the bike. I also like how the seat itself wraps around all sides of my child just in case the bike would ever fall down. The bike seems unbalanced when I am putting my child in the bike, but once we get on the road everything seems to balance out fine. I will use this bike seat until my son gets too tall or too heavy for it to work."
439621,0,"Like the title of my review says, this tool works for installation. However, if your SKS is as it came from the factory, this tool might not work to remove the crossbolt the first time. The reason is that the factory crossbolt nuts are usually heavily staked into the crossbolt itself. I broke one of these tools trying to remove the crossbolt nut before I realized it was staked. The plastic just isn't strong enough to provide enough torque to overcome the staking. This was the case on both of my SKS's, a Russian and a Romanian.

341741,1,"PROs: Really warm, not bulky, sharp lookingCONs: ExpensiveIf you're looking for a jacket that'll give much warmth without the bulk, the Arcteryx Delta is a good albeit more expensive option. I'd recommend researching online for stores that carry them on sale.I use this for snowboarding in days when it's colder out or when the winds are stronger. It keeps me warm all day and never gets in the way coming down hill because it feels so lightweight.The sizes run smaller, I suggest buying a size up."

118636,1,"I had overused my last pair, and what a difference these make. I have been using them for a few weeks consistently. I really like the adjustable straps to increase wrist support, and the mesh fabric on the palms to keep hands cool. I don't wear wraps under my gloves, these provide plenty of support. They are snug, good for hitting the bag, but aren't too bulky like some older versions. Love these gloves, excellent value."

The cover looks the same today as it did when we installed it on the canoe last fall.Note however that the sizing is exact. If your canoe is the least bit longer than the maximum lenght the cover will not fit. A cover for a sixteen foot canoe means just that 16' and 0"".Pros: Heavy material construction, attractive, sturdy.Cons: Tight fit if canoe is max size. Don't even think of stretching to fit a larger canoe.Would buy again and would recommend to another."

289857,2,"I really wish i had not taken the advice from the reviews to order a size up. The jacket is very pretty, i ordered a small in green envy and the color and quality of detail is really nice. It is really noisy however, and the fact that it engulfs me makes that worse. I would normally have ordered an extra small, and that would have been better. The frustration comes because the jacket is quite roomy everywhere but the shoulders , which means to return for an extra small would be prioritizing aesthetic alone, since mobility and therefore functionality would be impaired.I make my decisions to purchase items online carefully reading all available reviews and product details thoroughly.I am 5'2, 110 lbs. If this jacket fit me like a small I would be satisfied even though i was hoping fora xs fit, but instead it feels a bit bigger than a medium."

The screen house has two zippered doors and the back door of ours could not be used due to a bad zipper. We sent it back and purchased a Eureka (from Amazon) instead for $10 more and it was definately worth it. We've used the Eureka screen house once now and the quality is clearly much better than this Wenzel (no loose threads, etc.). It's also quicker and easier to set up!"

207612,1,"I did a lot of research on water filters prior to making the decision to purchase this product. I am very happy that I choose the Katadyn Pocket micro filter. I have used it several times already on camp outs and hikes and it has performed perfectly. The two main reasons I chose this unit over the other filters were for durability and the cost per gallon to filter the water. When looking at the filter replacement cost, the cost per gallon with the pocket is only about 1.5 cents ($200/13,000 gal.), compared to the hiker and hiker Pro which is 25 cents ($50/200 gal.). The initial cost is much more but over the life of the product, there is no question which product will last. The pump is very easy to use and pumps quicker then I expected. I also purchased the Katadyn Carbon Replacement Cartridge and it has helped, but does not make a huge difference in how the water tastes. I did read some reviews about the carbon replacement cartridge and how it is very messy and comes apart easily. When I received the cartridge, it took me a few minutes but then I realized that once the replacement cartridge is pushed together as far as possible, you then screw the top and bottom together and it holds great. Also, make sure to not overfill the cartridge with the carbon, that is when it becomes messy. I have recommended both of these products to family and friends, and some family members have already purchased the Pocket."

313746,0,"These are very comfortable gi pants. They are a good heavy weight, but soft cotton, not the heavy canvas type, flexible and easy to move in. I've had several different gi pants, and these are, by far my favorite. They are elastic waistband, rather than drawstring, but I prefer that. And as a female martial artist it can be difficult finding gi pants that fit well, but these are definitely the best I've worn.Update to this review: I had decided to purchase another pair of gi pants and ordered these again since I liked them so much the first time. Unfortunately, the gi pants that arrived this time were nothing like the first. The previous pants were brushed cotton, elastic waist. The pants I received the second time were the heavy canvas type material, drawstring waist, and had the ProForce label on the front, exactly what I did not want. I'm guessing the description is intentionally confusing because the pants come from different vendors and Tiger Claw has no idea what may really be shipping? At least I was able to return them without difficulty and was able to find another pair of gi pants elsewhere that fit perfectly. Just be aware when ordering the gi pants may be different than what you expect."
467451,0,"I was taking a 17day trip to europe and my only luggage was one backpack.I compared the following backpacks: '06 REI UL30, '06 REI Catalyst 35L,'06 REI UL45, '05 Kelty Redwing 3100, '06 Gregory z pack, '06 Gregory g pack,'06 Osprey atmos 50, '06 Osprey atmos 35Testing:First off I recommend REI for backpacks. They have a very liberal returnpolicy which allows you test at home and then return. Also very knowledgeableand helpful staff.Some of these (REI UL30, REI UL45, REI Catalyst 35L, Gregory Z-Pack and Kelty Redwing 3100) I purchased and tested at home, them later returned.For these I packed exactly what I was bringing with me to europe. Total weight of pack was 23-25 lbs., then later returned. I also did instore testing on all of them by packing weight sacks equaivalent to 20-25 lbs and then walking around the REI store for 15 mins.This was an April trip so I needed some mild to chilly weather clothes.For reference as to how much the packs can hold, this is what I packed in each of the bags I tested at home and eventually what I brought to europe on my trip:1 pair jeans1 pair lightweight long pants6 pairs boxers1 short-sleeved tshirt2 long-sleeved tshirts1 long-sleeve columbia fleece1 tolietry kit2 paperbacks2 small top10 travel books (equal to 1 paperback together).2 undershirts6 pairs socks1 pair gym shorts1 long sleeved button down shirt1 sweater1 folded up duffel bag to use for return trip for souvenirs1 outlet adapter1 ipod power supply1 cell phone power supply1 marmot precip jacket (sometimes I was wearing this)I first wanted to see if everything would fit and then I put the pack on for about 15-20 mins. I also wanted to get a pack that was small enough to carry onto a plane. For sizing note that I'm 6'3 190 and always tested the large size which hold a bit more than the smalls and mediums. Also note that I bought 4 of the REI stuff sacks and put clothes in those. They worked great for easier packing.Backpacks Tested:'06 REI UL30 - $85Tested in store and at home.Very light. Not much in the way of outer pockets. I could just barely get everything into this. That's with really squeezing and putting most books in outside pockets.I really liked the skinny/tall feel of the pack. The support system and padding on the shoulder straps was not as full/quality as the osprey, gregory or kelty. But good enough for my travel needs and comfortable. Though maybe not if you were doing an all day hike. If it was a little bigger or if I was bringing a little less it would have been the winner.'06 Catalyst 35L - $90Tested in store and at home.Light. But not as light as UL30 or UL45. And no outside pockets at all.This fit everything. Nearly equivalent space as REI UL45. The Support system and straps a touch better than the UL30, UL45. Also has the skinny/tall feel like the REI UL packs, which I felt was more comfortable and makes squeezing into airplane and traneluggage compartment much easier. In the end, the lack of outside pockets and it being a touch heavier than UL45 was the reason it wasn't the winnder.'06 Gregory Z-Pack - $190Tested in store and at home.This was a grade up in size and quality from the others. Very light. Lots of outer pockets with a big outside net pocket. I easily got everything into this with plenty of room to spare. I could fit 1.33 times my load.Seemed to be very high quality. The support system and shoulder straps were a step up from the REIs. But it had a ton of straps. Straps everywhere. The staps were really a nuisance. I liked it and was very comfortable. But it was more than I wanted to pay and was also concerned it was to big to carry on a plane.'06 Gregory G-Pack - $150Tested in store.I really liked the outside big net pocket. And like the Z-pack was of high quality. It didn't seem to fit as much stuff as the REI Catalyst 35L and maybe just as much or a little less than the REI UL30. Also seemed to be a little small for me. It rode real high on my back and didn't rest on my hips. The large of this seemed to fit like a medium of other packs.'06 Osprey Atmos 50 - $200Just looked at in store. Didn't put on and test. Looked great. REI didn't have a large on the floor. The REI staff were big on this model and a couple of them said they had bought one for themselves. But I was 1.5 weeks a way from my trip and couldn't take a chance on it not being shipped in time. The OSpreys were my favorite as far as style goes.'06 Osprey Atmos 35 - $160Tested in store. Had a fantastic support system. In a class by itself for thesupport system. It was the first one I tested in the store so I was just gettingstarted in getting the feel of the packs. Didn't test at home with my exact stuff.But based on in the store testing it seemed to hold less than other bags of the samelisted size. I say this based on how many of those 'weight' sacks that the REI staffloads in the pack for you. You then go walk around the store for 15 minutes.The REI UL30 and REI Catalyst 35L each fit more stuff than this bag. This bag wouldnot have been big enough for me.'05 Kelty Redwing 3100 - $70 (on sale on REI.Outlet, normally $110)Tested at home. This thing fit a ton. It's got a different configurationthan the other packs. This one is short and wide. The REIs were long and skinny.The Osprey and Geregory's were in between. It easily fit in everything.Fit as much as the Gregory Z-Pack, maybe more. Had good/enough outer pockets for my liking. At first, I though it was great. Had a comfortable shoulder straps and good support system. After a while though it seemed a little bit heavier than it should have. Maybe it was because all weight was outward, because of the short/wide style. I was also concerned that it was going to be too wide to fit into the overhead compartment on a plane or at least to big to pass the size test to get it onto the plane. I didn't want to take that chance. Though the REI.Outlet price was a great deal.'06 REI UL45 - $100 - WINNERThis is the one that I didn't return.Tested in store, at home and on a 17-day, 3-country, 4-hotel, 7-train and 4-planeeurope trip. Very light. Very durable. Very portable. Very comfortable. Not much in the way of outer pockets. The lack of outer pockets is its biggest fault. It fit everything listed above. But without much room to spare. Though I could have squeeze in a few more tshirts and didn't fully utilize the top pocket. Like the other REI packs I tested it has more of a tall/skinny style. That fit better for me and also seemed to carry the weight easier. It rested on my hips correctly. Not much in the way of bells and whistles like the Osprey and Gregory's. Only one outside packing strap that locked the cover to the top loading opening to the main body. But that's all I needed to get it tight and squeezed in. I thought this was a pro not a con. Whereas the Gregory's had straps everywhere. The UL45 also has an internal strap to compress the stuff in the pack. It's also on the UL30. Not sure if that made much of a difference, maybe a little. This pack and the UL30 had the ActivMotion support sytem which means the shoulder straps on each side and the back suspension are one piece that moves together. I actually didn't think this was advantage for me. It actually seemed to make the pack more likely to be crooked on my back than the other packs. But not a big deal. And REI totes it as an advantage so maybe I was doing something wrong.As I said above the REI packs seemed to hold more stuff than other packs with the same listed capacity. This was a big advantage. More space for your money.Keep in mind that I generally did not have the pack on my back for more than 1hr at a time. Usually just from train station to hotel. Or walking between terminals in the airport. But during those times it was very comfortable, you forget it's on your back. Also very protable in terms of storing it in airplace overhead compartments and train luggage racks. I never had a problem. It fit with plenty of room to spare.This would be the perfect pack for me if (in order of importance)...1 it had an outside back pocket/net like the Gregory packs. and/or a little bigger outside packs2 it had a water bottle holder pocket or any kind of pocket on the hipbelt3 the support system was a little closer to the Osprey Atmos packs.I highly recommended the REI UL 45. This pack has worked out great for me. I plan to use it on other trips and on weekend camping trips."

265918,2,"Never broke a spoke on a bike, ever.... until I got a set of these Weinmanns stock on my Fuji Absolute. Wheel went out of round within 200 miles.... broken spoke. Got them professionally fixed and trued. 200 miles later.... broken spoke, then another, then two more. Once one goes, the other ones go in quick succession... it was a matter of seconds. I'm 210 on 700c's. That shouldn't me too much to ask of them. I do crank up a lot of steep hills, but all on pavement. The wheel is so out of round now that it can't be totally re-trued, this from a professional bike shop. Either bum spokes, bum construction, or bum hubs, but something about these wheels doesn't agree with Fuji hybrid road bikes. I've read other reviews of the Weinmann equipped Fujis and there are a larger than normal ratio of complaints about broken spokes. I'm trading up to Mavics recommended to me by a pro bike mechanic."
273552,0,"This is a great watch. It's hard to find something in this price range that has a real mineral crystal. I have owned mine for over two years and not a scratch on the crystal yet. For a chronograph it has more than sufficient functions - chrono, count down timer, 2 separate time zone settings, alarm function - and the function and placement of the various control buttons is intuitive and logical. (I can't say that about most digital chronographs either.)It's a great watch. Or it was - until the band broke. Same complaint as the other reviews: The rubber clasp that keeps the tail of the band in place broke today, rendering the watch annoying to wear, at best. And since this is a highly proprietary band there is no way to replace the band with something off the shelf.The watch battery powering this thing actually lasted longer than the band. Pretty annoying that a broken little black band of rubber has rendered this watch to be unwearable. I'm going to avoid watches with proprietary bands in the future.It was nice - while it lasted."

440020,1,"The CRKT M16-14 Titanium Knife is durable and lightweight. For you men, this knife can easily be carried in your front trouser pocket but it's not as discreet as other knives. It also has an attached clip that allows you to clip it to a belt or pocket for quicker access. At 9 1/4 inches in the opened position, this knife is rugged. The titanium finish is easy to keep clean.The blades quick open finger grip allows it to be opened with lightening speed, quickly smoothly and effortlessly. Once opened, there's a double lock to prevent the knife from unexpectedly closing on your fingers. The positive spring lock housed inside the blade cavity automatically snaps into place underneath the blade anytime it's fully opened. This lock offers adequate protection without using the slider lock.There's also a quick release slider mechanism on the spine, next to the blade that acts as a secondary lock for the blade cavity lock. The use of this slider is optionable and it must be manually positioned with light finger pressure in order to positively keep the blade cavity lock in place. As complicated as this sequence sounds, it's actually very simple and easy to operate; although it does require that both hands be used to close the knife.Please rate this review if you find it helpful."

243853,1,"I got exactly what I wanted, a good 100% cotton long sleeve tee shirt to keep me warm in cool weather. I needed cotton because I work in an environment where there's a risk of fire so I can't wear synthetic fibers that would melt. I'm completely happy with the shirt, I like the fact that it does not have a tag in the back of the collar. If I remember correctly it came with a tag sewn into the side seam which I tore out easily. This shirt has a small logo on the left sleeve which I could do without but doesn't particularly bother me either."
374552,1,"As many others have mentioned, I was looking for a good affordable road bike for commuting and the occasional charity ride. When I started looking, a lot of the entry level bikes are way more than I wanted to spend, and it was difficult for me to find a used one in my size (I'm relatively short at 5'6"" tall). Then I found this Forge CTS 1000, and after reading a little about it, I decided to give it a shot.It was easy to assemble, and I took another reviewer's recommendation to immediately take it to my local bike shop to get things adjusted/tuned up. The local bike shop was impressed with the bike and the components on it for the money (made me feel better about my decision). The saddle alone is worth 100 bucks. So far, I have logged over 2,000 miles on this bike in two seasons. I'm 5'6"" tall, and the bike fits reasonably well (I wouldn't recommend for much shorter than me). I replaced the original stem with an adjustable one, and that helped immensely. It's lightweight for an aluminum frame, the saddle is comfortable (with the proper bike shorts), it shifts very nicely, and the tires have held up great. I'm still on the original tires/tubes, although I'll probably replace them before I take it out this coming season because I feel like I'm pressing my luck. I love the fact that it has dual brake levers on the handlebars, so I can brake when riding up top or down on the ram horns. This is an important safety feature for me since I ride in traffic during my commutes.Overall, this is a great bike for the money. I would highly recommend!"
139415,1,"I love this thing. It is small, and can fit in my pockets. I take it everywhere with me, and have been using it to strengthen my left hand as I use it less than my right.

Great for those people who do a lot of typing and computer related work as well."

I will probably just go an exchange them somewhere. The gloves them selves are perfectly acceptable. They have a fair amount of padding, with a wrist wrap that is just okay. Definately did not get what I wanted, but again, the listing was not very specific. I would say buy these if you will only get moderate use out of them."

281869,1,"I took a Pilates class on a thin industrial carpeted, unpadded, concrete floor. I tried my yoga mat but it wasn't thick enough for my tail bone when doing rolls. Searched local stores and the internet for 5/8"" thick mats (not a lot out there). Rolls up nicely with velcro straps to secure it. It's thick so won't lay perfectly flat on the one end, but that didn't get in the way. It's bulkier when rolled up (not quite an 8"" diameter) compared to yoga mats but it's just as soft with good grip. Thin mats roll up smaller and roll out flat, but if you need the extra cushion this works great. It could also be used as a camp mat but I'd put it on a tarp not right on the ground to protect it's soft surface."

I thought it was incredibly funny-looking, but since I had it and it was like new, I figured I'd try it. I sat on it. I hated it. I tried it several times more. I still hated it. I tried it again. I hated it worse. It came off and a regular seat went on.So, what does this prove? It proves some people will like this seat and some won't. It would better to try it out first if you can.Oh, and it squeaks."
295345,0,"As I said in my title, the watch is HUGE. Its face is about the size of a credit card. Not the larger distance size of a credit card the smaller. If you look closely at the watch you can see some good details put into the watch and start to appreciate the look of it. Unfortunately from afar, no one else can realize you have anything other then a blotch of orange around your wrist. If you're feeling nice and colorful and want to wear the watch, then its perfect. As for an everyday watch I'd probably look else where. Much better watches out there for this price. Though I can't say I wouldn't recommend it to someone who really digs the color and watch itself. Mechanically the watch seems decent. No problems what so ever in that department."
497611,2,"The nondescript white box received prominently displays a sticker labeled ""Made in China,"" recalling shoddy products sold at discount prices. Mind you, I have no problems with products from China, but if you think of the products that you may have purchased where there's a little sticker, that is not even part of the box label, that says ""Made in ___"" you expect a cheaply made product.The latch that hold the plastic case shut is rather flimsy, and one of them broke after 2 days. One of the pins that hold the handle to the lantern broke after 4 days. All in all, this product just feels very brittle and easy to break. Pretty much every component of the lantern seems very flimsy.I have seen some of the other LED or fluorescent lanterns, and this is probably the brightest of the lot. But the light projected is not uniform. Like Michael N. Trevor says in his review, what you get are little white dots of light that project radially out from the lantern. So if you hold up the lantern to a wall, you see a bunch of horizontally spaced white spots adjacent to eachother. This is kind of annoying, since you want to use this as a lantern, and not a multi-headed flashlight. If the object to be illuminated is at the same horizontal level as the lantern, you're more or less fine. But what if you want to illuminate something that is one or more feet above or below the level of the lantern? Imagine: you put the lantern on a bench, and you can only light up things that are at the bench level, and only if they fall within one of the white spots. Or, you walk with the lantern in front of you at night, but you have to tilt the lantern to actually light up the path.I own a Coleman white gas lantern, and of course there is no comparison on the brightness differences. But for indoor usage, or just casually talking outside, this lantern would be ok.PROS:-not really cheap or expensive-pretty bright light compared to other battery-powered lanterns-the case had these 4 little indentations where you can squeeze in 4 D cell batteries. Pretty cool - you don't have to worry about battery leakage.-if you twist the lantern around rapidly, you can get a strobe effect-doesn't smell like kerosene/gas lanterns, and is silent and cool to the touchCONS:-cheap materials (hinges made of flexible plastic [I could indent the plastic ""bolt"" that held the handle to the body with my fingernail])-the ""white spots"" phenomenonaddendum: just realized that Realtree 30 LED Lantern might be the exact same product, cheaper, and with more stuff in combo package."
288399,1,"I've actually held back on posting a review for this cage sooner because I wanted some time to test it out on the road before critiquing. Pretty much this cage does it all- probably the best I've used so far (I've gone through a few)..The cage itself is listed as 17grams, but the manufactures also include two aluminum bolts to bring the total to 20grams. Even at its weight, the cage does not compromise strength or handling. Never dropped my bottle yet, even through rough potholes and the likes.Great cage, I should have tried this sooner."

336458,0,This is a fine pack for a kid age 10-13. The straps are weird and it sits on your back in a strange manner. There should've been some sort of chest strap for the shoulder straps to provide support and the shoulders straps probably need more adjustment options.
60429,1,"This gift was purchased as a present for xmas. The order shipped and got to me in a great amount of time! I purchased this gift for a person that broke up with me one week before christmas so unfortunately I never saw item out of box. Great product though! Every item that I have ordered from you has always made it to me in record time and it perfect condition. I would definitely recommend you to anyone, and if i ever need anything specific I know I definitely know where to look."
345946,0,"This is a good cyclo-computer for the enthusiast like myself. Its hard to find a unit that combines speed, cadence, and an hrm at this price. The display has several options and most cyclists will find one that offers a decent combination of what they want to know without having to flip through different views. Sensor reliability is ok with the hrm and speed sensor, but somewhat unreliable with the cadence sensor. I transfer this unit between 3 bikes and on one bike I had to mount the unit on the top tube to pick up cadence.Data transfer is done by sound, yes sound, and you'll need a computer with a microphone to record a ridiculous chirping song that is uploaded to the polar web site for their simple flash based analysis tool. I'll admit that the process has worked every time, but if data analysis is important to you then look elsewhere. Regardless, the data transfer is probably not a selling point to a cyclist looking at the cs200 anyways. But if it is, you're probably going to want to transfer the averages to other software if you are willing to work within the limitations.My biggest gripe with the cs200 is the sensors and their battery life. The sensors are sealed and you cannot change the batteries without breaking them open. Polar claims they last for 2400 hours. I would claim about 200 - 400 hours ,if that much. I've been able to break a couple of them open to replace the battery, but it is easy to destroy the sensor during this process. The sensors aren't extremely expensive (less than 40 dollars), but across 3 bikes they could add up to a couple hundred dollars a year. Moreover, its aggravating to know that it would have been simple for polar to design them so the batteries were replaceable.Cycling gadgets are never perfect (or even close for that matter), and having used several wireless computers (including the cheap ones, mavic, cateye, shimano, and campy ergopower), I'll admit that none of them have impressed me. My next purchase will either be wired, or something expensive, but my expectations are the same."

10537,0,"Columbia Sportswear Men's Cathedral Peak Vest. I ordered two of these, one grey and one Tusk color. I really like the Tusk. These run a little bit small and should have just a bit more length to them. I'm 6'3"" tall and normally an extra large works fine for me, but not in this vest. I would have ordered an extra large Tall, but they don't come in the Tall size.I really like the fleece feel and the two outside zipper pocket, but it would be nice if they had an inside pocket, like Columbia puts on the inside of their Cougar Peaks outerwear."

396752,1,I've had this bike for quite some time and it is a great ride. It fits in the back of my Cessna 152 (a small 2 seat airplane) and I have carried it to many destinations. At 30lbs it is well within my payload limits. I also use it as my main ride and am quite pleased with the feel and performance. I am a little over 6ft tall and this bike fits me quite well.
261739,0,"While it does do what it claims (reduces recoil, protects receiver, protects scope), I experienced about a 20% failure to feed rate while using this item. This was with baurnal golden bear ammo, I think some hotter loads most likely would not have these problems.If the buffer was not so thick I think this problem may not have happened, but the life of the buffer would most likely be reduced. I may try removing a few coils from the recoil spring so I can continue to use this buffer.Overall a good product, just be sure to thoroughly test your rifle after installation."

240083,0,The bow and arrow set is intense. Hard to pull back for a 12 year old. It will be great once she figures out how to use it. Probably needed an instruction booklet on how to use it.
425269,0,"I bought these socks for our teenaged son, who plays baseball. Of course Under Armour is wildly popular right now, and he wanted these because of that fact.However, the socks are thin synthetic material and fit somewhat tight on his average sized leg, and they made his feet sweat. I also thought they were overpriced for the quality. We liked the Mizuno Performance Solid Color Sport Socks better for the same price, although the ""stylish"" logo isn't easily visible while wearing them."
288127,0,"Great instructions (and customer service for our one missing piece). All games work well and seem to be fairly good quality. Table looks good and is a nice size if space is an issue.Two key issues with the table:1) the balls/pucks get stuck inside the table and are almost impossible to get out (they fly out of the goal box which is not fully-contained into the innards of the table. This is significant flaw in design and very annoying to deal with.2) When rotating from one game to the next, the foosball rods get stuck and prevent the table from turning (you then have to hold 4 rods in to turn to the next game, almost impossible for kids to do by themselves). The manufacturer provides clips to put on to keep rods from moving, but they are difficult to take on and off (almost impossible for my 7-year old) and therefore not useful (and also easy to lose). My friend has a 3-game table with more ""clearance"" so the rods do not get in the way when turning the table."
240821,2,"I originally bought this tool while looking for a multitool that incorporated a good selection of tools as well as spring-loaded pliers. Normally, I stay in the Leatherman camp, but they didn't make any full-size tools with pliers. The day I received this tool, the first thing I noticed was how fat and stubby it was, and the tools were quite short as well. I was planning on coping with it until I decided to check the Leatherman website, and lo and behold, here were new tools incorporating spring-loaded pliers! The Sidekick and Wingman both have Leatherman quality, good-size (but minimalist) tools, and spring-loaded pliers. I heavily suggest one of those two (I have the Wingman) over the Suspension I returned."

116371,0,"I basically like this cyclometer, especially the readout which is large and easy to read. However, scrolling through the functions is a bit of a pain. But the real problem is that the wire is SO flimsy. One broke shortly after I purchased this item so I ordered another one (actually the whole connection setup) directly from Sigma for around $12. Yesterday it broke again while out on a ride, so I'm getting rid of the thing completely and going wireless. I had a Cateye forever and this lasted around 6 months."
141985,1,Bought this for one of my granddaughters for whom I also purchased a toddler bike. She loves it and that means she uses it...which is exactly what needs to happen.

505262,0,"Why only 3 stars? There are no instructions on proper form. Several times Chalene says ""remember how I'm always telling you to keep your guard up?"" Well actually no, I don't remember because no where does she go over form. For a while I thought I was missing something, kept looking through all the dvds for a section I missed but nope, not there. Apparently this was covered in TurboJam, however for those of us new to turbo, you have to figure it out on your own and hope you don't injure yourself in the process or spend more money and purchase TurboJam. Had there been instruction on proper form, I would rate the program 4+ The dvds have tons of ads for other products on them. I don't mind the teambeachbody/wowy ones at the beginning of every workout because I know that could be very helpful for some people but I find it strange that they have infomercials for their other workout/weight loss programs. I mean come on, I bought this to lose weight, so why would I need something else if it works as great as advertised? Fortunately, those are only seen if you leave the dvd running after the workout so I can skip them. Chalene's promotion of the recovery formula during the workouts is annoying. She isn't an annoying instructor though, well at least not yet. I didn't take off any points off for this but I will warn that the music may not be for everyone, I was quite surprised at some of the songs on the program. While there isn't anything that could not be played on popular radio and I know it's supposed to be fun, I don't really enjoy dancing/working out to ""Booty Call"". There are also songs such as ""I'm a bad girl"" and ""I got you're boyfriend"" so if that type of music offends you, better look elsewhere.What's Good: The program has structure; I like that there is a calendar that tells me which workout to do when, I don't have to guess or do my best trying to come up with a balanced routine. I find it easy enough to talk myself into doing the workout, even if I don't feel like it. There is enough variety for me right now, sure there are the same punches and kicks on all the cardio dvds, but they get put together a little differently and the music changes; it's better than a single dvd or two that you alternate. Abs 20 is killer (in a good way!) and I enjoy Stretch10 (this is done almost everyday). There is a ""New To Class"" option which is great for learning the routines, but it is a breakdown on the combination of moves, not how to execute the moves. I used the New To Class about 2-3 times before doing it regular. There is a modifier in every workout, so if you don't want to or can't jump you should follow Alee. If you are very overweight, I suggest not doing the very high impact jumps until some of the weight comes off. There is always a third person up on stage, which changes depending on the workout, so it is nice to see that not everyone does the moves exactly the same (differences in body type, flexibility, etc.) however I'm not too sure they all use good form.My results: well so far I have completed month 1 and I don't have any :( I have 40-50 pounds to lose, so the fact that I have not lost even 1 pound, and my measurements remain the same is disappointing. During the program I did a pretty good job of eating clean (& quit my extreme soda consumption, I drink only water), sometimes I use weighted gloves, and my heart rate monitor says I'm doing high intensity. I have taken several days off and in that time dropped about 2 pounds, so perhaps it took a whole month for my metabolism to adjust. I am starting with month 2 today and I'm intending to finish the program. I will update my results when I'm done.Overall, the program is ok and I'm sure I'll still use some of the workouts mixed up with something else later. For a workout, it's fun and the music is good for the most part. I don't regret getting it, although I got mine used for half price so I don't know if I would feel the same way had I paid full price."
95609,1,This knife is a great value for the money. I use it on a daily basis and it holds up very well plus its big enough to get the job done but it still fits well in your pocket. The finish on the knife looks great and is easy to keep clean. I love the fact that Case knives are American made as well.
269780,2,Disappointed in the way the sock fit. It should have read small solid-color tube sock. I couldn't get it up past my ankle which sucked.

It does an excellent job on everything else, including serrations, is compact, and durable."

429812,1,"I had been looking for a pair of black, sporty, comfortable shoes for walking around campus for a while now. I happened to come across this pair and decided to take a chance with them. I haven't worn Reeboks since I was like 10 years old.. and I think these were a killer deal at 25.99. I didn't want completely black shoes, and I really like how the gum colored sole of the shoes breaks up the blackness of the shoe, and the moderately gray stripes on the side aren't too bright. I'm not a very flashy person, and so I had planned on switching out the shoelaces anyways, but these shoes do come with an extra pair of black laces. There are only three small RBK logos in orange; two as seen in the picture on the tongue and on the bottom front portion, along with one on the upper back portion of the shoe. The shoes are surprisingly comfortable and padded like typical skate shoes, only that they don't have the super puffy, wideness of most skate shoes, which I really don't like. They give the slim feel and lightness of pumas, while retaining the ultra comfort and well-cushioned feeling of any other skate shoes. However, I have to admit that I have thin feet, and these shoes are slim enough that they fit just right. I wouldn't recommend these to people with really wide feet. For anybody else, these shoes are extremely comfortable and have a really great look to them. A sort of subtle ostentatious feeling to them. Well-made product."

88527,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
161167,0,Although this watch looks very nice it doesn't take long before it stops moving. So if you're one who doesn't like to sleep with a watch on I would look for another...I was impressed with the way it looked though. As well as the way it was packaged.
308805,1,I've used this product on the roughest grounds and its held up without any leaks. I set my tent up not realizing there was a tree stump where I planned to sleep - but this air mat added the padding needed.

129212,0,"Let me start by saying that this game is a GRAND improvement from last years game. The in-the-paint action is phenominal and the level of thought in shot selection makes for a more realistic experience than you get from ESPN Basketball. However, Live's franchise mode once again isn't up to par with ESPN. After three seasons I had Paul Pierce and Trace Mcgrady starting on my bench. It's so unbelievebly easy to stack your team because the salary cap system is awfully executed.In the end, this game will WOW you on the court, and leave you scratching you head at the GM's desk.PROS- Smoothest, most realistic gameplay- Well done sound, sountrack and announcers perfectCONS- No thought in training camp mode- Salary cap ruins franchise mode- EA's comeback AI always lets the CPU score when needed."

161696,0,"Couple years back I was looking for a Christmas gift for my father who has considerably more money than me and therefor hard to buy for. I came across this inexpensive item and it seemed like a good idea. My father and his wife were very excited about the gift. However, once they placed it in the pool both of us realized that a single light didn't really do much though it still looked nice. This worked out to my advantage in a way. You really need four or five of these units to properly light a normal sized pool. So now I'm on my fourth Christmas and these little lights have turned in to an easy and nice present. My father and his wife take care of these units very well and all three original purchases are still in good working condition.Bottom line: nice cute gift, but you need several to really light a normal sized pool."

We could not find this particular pair in the stores, so - got them online. She loves them."

405338,0,My 7 year-old daughter loves her new sleeping bag. The one big concern that I have is the drawstring at the head used to draw the head area tight. My daughter moves around a great deal when she sleeps and somehow got the drawstring wound around her neck. It was tight enough that she could not untangle herself. It took my husband and myself quite a while to remove it...thankfully it was not tight enough to restrict breathing. I would definitely recommend removing the drawstring if you purchase this item.
489942,2,"I carried this wallet for a week or so before giving up on it. I like that it's solid and small in my pocket, but I couldn't fit as much as I needed to in it. Getting my debit card in and out was much slower than with my usual billfold. If you start out the day with a couple 20's you're fine until you start gathering smaller bills - they won't fit. My business cards don't quite fit and got dinged up. The hinge is just a weak, thin strip of plastic. The plastic looks and feels cheap."
202781,0,"These Klaxon-type horns are almost all made in China. There is no real difference between the ""chrome"" horn and the red plastic horn, except that the chrome horn costs $5 to $10 more than the red plastic one. Both are plastic, even the so-called ""chrome"" model. The horn part is chromed plastic, and comes off in most units; so if you're a metal fabricator, go ahead and make a brass or metal horn! What's disapppointing is that it emits a high-pitched ""uuuhhrrrrrhhh."" I tuned mine by decreasing the voltage & current, using a 1.7 to 2 ohm resistor in series at the positive (+) end of the wiring until I got the classic ""ahooogahh"" sound.It should be noted that there is an adjustment slot; an allen bolt that's located between the + (positive) and - (ground) terminals at the back of the motor, so that if your horn doesn't sound, or just squeals or howls, try minute adjustments to this allen bolt.You will need a metal ""L"" bracket to mount this horn, unless you have a flat area inside your engine compartment that's as long and as wide as the whole unit. I recommend you solder the connections to the existing horn wiring, rather than use crimp connectors (but do use the spade lug connectors going to the motor itself). Also I recommend that the horn is mounted horizontally rather than vertically, and that you don't mount it in the wheel well, or it will get wet and corrode the motor's brushes, bearings, and armature/windings. If you mount it behind the bumper, or at bumper level, it might also get wet.Because these Klaxon-type horns are driven by an electric motor, you won't be needing a horn relay. This also makes it possible for you to wire it separately from your factory horn...and you'll only need extra wire and a push button. Have your mechanic install it and tune it for you. Don't do it yourself."
451901,2,"This sweater is probably one of the worst things I have bought on amazon. To begin, the sweater itself wasn't bad. It fit nicely and it was warm and comfortable. However, when taking it out of the package it was really wrinkled, which was not a big deal but then I saw something that was a big deal. Two brown stains were on the back of the sweater. There is no excuse for stains on a brand new sweater. Hopefully I can get the stains out, but if I don't I'll be pissed because who the hell is going to want to wear a white sweater with brown stains on the back of it? To conclude this product review, I think that you guys should keep a closer watch on what your employees are doing while packaging clothing because not everyone likes to give the impression that they s*** themselves when going out somewhere."

506011,2,"I like the functionality of this watch but found that within a couple years of use it started falling apart. The pink plastic/rubber on the sides of the watch started coming apart from the watch itself and that is what holds the watch together with the band. I started super gluing it but don't know yet if it will hold! It seems like the band was never attached well to the watch component from when it was new and then it eventually started separating.Also- if you are going to use the product in Florida be careful. If you spend much time in Florida you know that many rubbery products disintegrate very quickly in that climate for some reason. When I use this watch in Florida when I'm on vaca the buttons on the side, which are rubbery (but not the band itself) get all gooey and tacky....like disintegrating rubber.Also- I like the pink color but this type of resin watch band gets dirty with wear and it does not get clean when you wash it. So if you insist on going with this watch despite the band/watch falling apart then choose a very dark color band so the discoloration of the band is not visible."

110696,0,"I received my net in a very timely manner, and I was greatly looking forward to a long weekend away at the beach with some daily volleyball games. Day 1 went fine. Day 2 was not quite as fun, at least with the set-up of the net/poles. The telescopic poles do NOT slide in and out easily if even the slightest bit of sand sticks to the poles. My set is now in a temporary 'not usable' status until I can unstick the poles or have new ones sent to me.

293179,2,"OK, this is a little unorthodox, but here goes: I buy kids' fishing poles to use to entertain my cats - they go completely bonkers when I tie a lead sinker and some cellophone to the line (without the hook of course), then ""cast"" for them down our long hallway. It's an easy, fun way to play with them without spending a ton of money.I had this gear for only a few months when it fell apart. The cleat holding the reel to the pole is made out of flimsy plastic and one flange of it broke off. I was able to replace it for a while using electrical tape, but eventually I also started having trouble reeling it in, the top wouldn't stay screwed on, etc.It's a good length for my admittedly unusual use for it, but after so much trouble with the reel I replaced it with the Daiwa D-Fish Combo kit, with which I've been a lot more happy. You can also buy the D-Fish here on Amazon for about $20.Happy fishing!"
324843,1,"I absolutely love this grill. It is pretty, handy and cleans up great. The grates are top of the line cast iron and heat up well. They are great for searing meat. I absolutely love cooking chicken on it if you brine it first. You can control the burner heigth well and if you like you can use only one side and then put your food on the other side as it gets done before other of course if you have room like I do to keep it warm. I think this is the best grill for our patio that we have had in years. The gas is easy to change and love how it folds up too. It is so pretty on our patio that it fits right in with the decor. I would love to thank Coleman for putting out something like this. I plan on taking it to some of our outdoor Red Hat Picnics too. It shipped in a timely manner and the only thing is be prepaired to move a heavy box cause this one is worth it's weight... GRILLIN RED HAT CINDY"
381858,0,"If you are insalling this shore connection in a new installation application; it might work. I purchased this to replace my existing cable scuttle on my Jayco travel trailer. This connector housing is too small to replace the existing scuttle, so I'm going to have to drill a new hole and leave the existing scuttle installed. Also, the strain relief clamp on the housing of this connector is designed for Romex cable. Being a 30Amp connector, you should be using 10 AWG cable. There is not enough space in the back of the housing to accomdate manipulation of the 10 AWG cable once the connector is wired because it wires in the rear of the connector. If you use an SJ or SO or SOW type cable, you'll have to install your own strain relief through the rear of the housing. Not what is expected. They should be more specific with the specifications on this item."
490188,0,"This is worth the price--especially the price online--but when screwing it in you have to be very careful not to put the screw on the thread line (which happens to be in the middle of the area were you put the screw!), or the thread will wrap up in the screw. This might not happen if you have a really fast drill. On the other hand, it happens fairly easily because you have to put in the screws upside down if you install it as shown (with the top flap folded in).Still, once it is in, it is great."

364736,0,"I am in my mid twenties and am an avid surfer and was very into skateboarding up until about 5 years ago. I was very intreaged by the the Trikke (the model 6 to be exact). Quite frankly had I been younger I doubt I would have been able to swollow my pride and buy one, but again I was very intreaged and more mature than 5 years ago. First of all the Trikke itself is a very well built product, in my opinoin. Upon first recieving it I was impressed and excited. And the fact is, it is a good product, and well built. But I felt it is more of an excersise machine than a transporatation tool. The marketing of the commercials made the product seem very appealing to the skateboard/ surfing/ snowboarding demographic. But I felt that the Trikke was much more of an excesice tool than something like a bike or skateboard. I do believe it would be much more fun had I not live in Florida where there are no hills. Basically the Trikke is a good product, but definitely more of a fitness tool than a fun means of getting around. On flat ground its fairly tiresome to generate speed and you don't look too ""cool"" in the process...especially when someone views you from behind. On the other hand downhill decents are much more of what you may want if you are looking at this purchasing this product for other than fitness. Also two things to note: I felt that the basis for propelling the Trikke forwad was the same principle as roller/ inline skating, just much more stable with a center wheel, handlebars, and breaks... although it is much more strenuous then you may think. And be careful skidding to a stop or doing a skidding turn as in the commercial, its fun, but causes the wheels to get flat spots and the smooth ride turns very bumpy. Hopes this help you."
244660,1,"Bought this lock for school and couldn't be happier. Excellent lock, very solid, better than any others I have seen on campus. It's heavy, so what? Trash the bracket, it still looks like it's in beta testing. Anyone complaining about the key/keyhole being difficult is not being patient and understanding it. Fully insert the key and twist it carefully. If it only turns halfway, it wasn't in all the way. Look inside the keyhole and at the key to understand how the thing works before you start forcing anything. It is a series of independently spinning disks that the key is inserted through, if your key doesn't go all the way in, the disks arent initially ""lined up"" to allow the key to go in, wiggle the key in a gentle twisting motion and it will correct itself. What do you want? This, which takes more care and is more secure, or the old kryptonite lock that could be opened with a BIC pen? Would buy again, if I needed a second lock. Which I dont. Because this one is awesome."

211792,1,"In my opinion, this is the very best paintball marker. I cannot think of any cons about this gun. But there are plenty of pros.As you may know its a constant battle between Tippmann and Spyder. Tippmann is popular for reliabilaty and Spyder is popular for performance. However, I have never seen an electronic Spyder work for more than a day. Tippmann by far beats Spyder in reliabilaty. My Tippmann has never failed me and people often say it can't be used in speedball, however, the last speedball game I played in, I shot 5 out of 12 people ...hmmmm that sounds like it works very well for speedball to me. People say its a noob gun because it shoots slow. Well it shoots 8 bps (balls per second) out of the box. Thats faster than some Spyder markers. In fact the Tippmann 98 custom is the most upgradeable marker in the paintball market. For instance, you can add a e-trigger to the 98 to make it shoot much faster, but you can call it a newbie gun if you want to.If someone ever tells me that it is a newbie gun, they seem to change their mind after I lite 'em up on the field. So, if you want a marker for an inexpensive price, heck, if you want a marker that will last more than a day, this is, by far, the gun to buy."
336911,0,"I agree that these levers have a nice vintage/retro look to them; however, you do get what you pay for. I ordered these and they look great on an old curser I restored but I had two issues with these levers:First, the space where the cable goes threw (upper left area on lever in product image) was larger than the cable housing (and cable housing end) and use of the break pulled the entire cable housing threw causing the break to fail as there was no tension on the cable. I remedied this by making some 'custom' brushings out of noodles from a set of old mt. bike breaks. It seems like I was missing such parts, unless it is just not advertised that such brushings are needed but not included as I've seen them on other levers.Second, they did not hold tight onto my handlebars. This might be due to the bars being a smaller diameter but I would think such things are fairly standard. I remedied this by inserting pads of leather between the leaver and handlebar and re-tightening them snug.They work great and hold tight now after the little bit of work and I'm glad I chose them although I'd recommend a different set for someone who didn't feel as tinker-savvy - unless you also had or bought lever housing brushings and some rubber or leather strips."

155129,0,"I have had this quick release mount for about 3 years now, and actually bought an extra plate to mount on my other boat so I can swap the troll motor from one to the other.The handle with the stainless pins has always been a tight fight, but with a little tugging and pushing I am always able to get it after a few minutes. Unfortunately, today when I put the motor on my boat and started to push the handle through, the plastic handle broke right in the middle. I didn't realize there wasn't metal all the way through the handle until that moment, and because there is a big hole drilled through the middle of the plastic part, there are two thin areas of plastic on top & bottom. This is a weak point, and unfortunately you cannot just buy a replacement handle.I would have given the mount 5 stars except for this defective design with the handle, and no replacement available for purchase. I can probably fix this myself or jury-rig some sort of replacement, but it's disappointing to say the least."
121056,0,"This is my first heart rate monitor and I spent a good amount of time researching. I use it for tracking how I'm doing with endurance running, which I have recently taken up again. My body wants to force myself faster, and I burn out quickly. The HRM helps me stay in peak cardio zone while forcing my body to stay at a pace slow enough that I can keep it up for a long time.WHAT I LIKE: this was affordable enough and from a trusted brand and had overall very strong reviews. The chest strap is comfortable. I like that it's easy to use. I love that it interfaces accurately with the Arc Trainer and the Treadmill at the gym, so I can just look ahead and see how I'm doing, rather than checking the watch. Apparently many HRMs don't play nicely with the gym equipment.WHAT I WISH HAD BEEN CLEARER IN THE DESCRIPTION: the watch's measurements were not listed! I would prefer a slightly smaller watch, as this one is a bit bulky for the size of my wrist and hand (I'm a woman; unlikely to be a concern for a man). Also, while the HRM tracks how long you spend in ""zone"" it only has a binary option. I thought, based on the descriptions, that it would track three levels of cardio performance--warmup, effective cardio, and peak cardio. There's a real difference between a workout in which I jog for 20m with my heart rate around 140-150, spend only 15m with the rate above 165 and a workout in which I jog for 10m with my heart rate around 150 and spend 25 minutes with it above 165. But this monitor records them both as 35 minutes in cardio zone.WHAT I DO NOT LIKE: So this thing files all my workouts. Great. But I read the brochure front to back and it never mentioned an app or a website to which I can transfer that data and track it over time clearly and easily. I still need that. If this HRM did that easily or the brochure included the info I need to get started, I'd call it a 90% perfect purchase. As is, I hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for the things I've described in this review."

We bought it for a White Elephant gift exchange, and I ended up with my own gift. Once you figure out how to aim (the sight actually worked fairly decent for me), you can consistently hit folks with an air ball. The firing action makes so much noise (WAP!!), good luck sneaking up on your dog...she moved before the air ball reached her. Had some fun with it, and then the membrane came detatched after a day.

I guess if you will always be keeping your bottle in the upright position or just keeping it in a bike cage, the sports cap will be fine but if you want to toss it in your bag, got to go with the loop cap. Or better yet, get a different brand, it's really not worth the hassle & the money. My Nalgene & Camelbak plastic bottles far exceed in function & quality than Klean Kanteen bottles.

378223,2,"Finally after a little over a year of owning this item, I am writing a review. I use if for two adult bikes on my Mazda which has a spoiler. The design of the rack does not allow for a lot of clearance over the spoiler by the two small metal braces. When I add the bikes, the rack is sitting just barely over the spoiler and when I go over bumps the rack damages the spioler and chips the paint off. Not only that, the rubber padding leaves a mark on my trunk. I wish I spent more money and got a better product. It depends on the car and the weight of the bikes you are trying to transport. If you have a car like the audi TT that is pictured you wont have issues with the metal braces. Transporting three bikes would be not be advised."

The XL measures 18"" from armpit to armpit (36"" bust) without any stretching, but the thin fabric is quite stretchy and loose. I'm a 36"" bust and am quite sure the L would be more flattering on me."

That part is great! however they are lacking in protection from the cold. They help some with this but not enough. The gloves do seem to be tough though which is 1 of the most important things that I was looking for. I try to work fast and finish my task before my hands get to cold and painful to continue.

Luckily, my son only got a bump on his forehead (where his helmet wasn't covering), and he wasn't hit by a car (which could have happened). I've inspected the seat since, and everything looks good on it..... the only thing that could have happened (since I installed it perfectly this morning) is that either my son or another kid took off the rear safety latch when I wasn't looking.But, the good news is that the seat protected him from the fall, except for his forehead... maybe that should be a plus when buying this item... it does roll across pavement with a certain amount of safety. But it probably won't protect the kid from a car crash.The take-home message is that any potential buyer should ALWAYS check all the connections before EVERY ride. If you do that, this should be a good seat worth buying. But I had to put the 3-stars in because there wasn't such a warning that this latch is so easy for kids to undo! Otherwise, I would give this 4 1/2 stars, since it's a great seat.Good luck riding with your kids."

509578,0,"[[ASIN:B0008G2V6M Kettler Favorit Rowing Machine]I am finally ready to begin using this machine on a daily basis. It hasn't been easy, but it's now performing as expected, so I've decided to enter my preliminary remarks. More comments will follow later after I've used it for a while.(1) Ease of assembly. There are differing opinions here, but I'll have to go with my experience, so I'll call it difficult. However, it was more difficult than it should have been because it didn't come with the correct manual. However, even the correct manual didn't make assembly easy, because I had difficult matching the pictures with the machine. As a result, I stopped using the assembly instructions and finally put it together with minimal help from the manual.(2) Rowing resistance: Some had no problems, for others (including me) it was impossibly difficult to row this machine in the beginning. I have to believe that this difference is caused by differences in the machines. In other words, the quality control must be lacking. To solve this problem, I called Kettler and sent them an E-mail. The phone technician's information was not helpful because it was wrong, and my E-mail was never answered. Fortunately, Sandy gave me the answer: remove the accordion adjustors. That did the trick. After removing the rubber accordion adjustors, I could easily adjust the resistance from too easy to too difficult. However, I still have to determine the proper balance, because there is a trade-off between using the pedals and the row bars. With the resistance I now have for rowing, the pedals don't give me enough resistance. I guess it's just a matter of fine-tuning the resistance.Addendum: Delves Corvello, above, has a remedy for when removing the accordion adjustors causes slippage of the resistance setting [Note: I have no such problem]. Delves says, "" Get a PVC connection tube with 1"" ID, cut it to the height that you like the bracket to stay and install it below the bracket and above the handle hinge point.""(3) Computer: I've read the reviews and, because I'm not looking for any more trouble, I haven't yet attached it. I probably will--some day.(4) Adjusting resistance: It's easy when the arms are up. After you remove the accordion adjustors, of course.(5) Future improvements: Compare sitting/rising on/from the floor with sitting/rising on/from a chair. Because higher is better, I'm going to build a platform about two feet high upon which I'll place the Kettler. I'll also find a way to keep the arms up when not in use. That will make it much more accessible and easy to use, and that will help me stick with my exercise program. That's important. because the best machine in the world is no good if you find it inconvenient to use."

Protip: Put them on BEFORE you mount the lockjaw to your grip (or bar!).My only complaint is that the blue anno doesn't ""pop"". It's kind of a dull, steel-blue more than a vivid blue like on Fox adjustment dials or a deep, saturated blue like on my Pivot's hardware. I ended up taking them off and using black ones I already had because it was just one too many shades of blue. C for style, A+ for function."

414629,1,"Based on the pictures the front sight seemed bigger than what I wanted, and I thought of getting the standard size sight, but took a chance with the big dot and glad that I did as it is smaller then what I expected. Kit came with everything needed to remove stock sites and install these, no need to purchase separate tools. Remember to not over tighten front site and I would not loctite the rear site till you are happy with the alignment. Following the recommended site picture produced a nice tight shot pattern and all on center mass. I was more accurate with the stock sites, but picking up the front site took too long and with this site I was able to pick up the front site much quicker which is what you want with a SD weapon. Additionally the sites are easy to pick up in low or no light situations. If you want to win competitions look elsewhere, if you want sites for SD do not hesitate to get these. I have no complaints about the seller, shipping was fast and well packaged. If you are thinking of getting these or any other sites, do not keep the order too long in your cart as it seems anything to do with guns is rising in price."

We recently took a two week river tour in France, with daily walking tours at each stop. The slacker chair allowed me to &#34;take a load off&#34; each time the tour guide would stop to talk about something, allowing me to take the tours rather than just stay on the boat. As others have said, the only shortcoming was the carry strap which never really allowed a comfortable carry when slung over one's back."

It does show you different jump steps which is interesting.Overall I guess if I was better at it I might enjoy it more."
49172,0,The hit-a-way is more or less what I was looking for but there is one thing that would make it a better product. My goal was a training tool that my 11 year old could set up on his own. In that sense it worked well. The main frustration was that the bottom rope gets caught on the velcro piece that holds it in place so the user needs to grab the ball and throw it as opposed to being able to hit it. This happens about 20% of the time but that's enough to cause a kid to lose interest sooner than later.
281190,0,"With an increasing amount of deployments to desert environments, and facing the possibility of limited resources, the concept of using solar power to charge my electronic devices seems like a great idea. The mysoldius universal solar charger advertises the ability to do just that, charge electronic devices using only the power of the sun.The solar charger comes with several different adapters to attach to the end of the cable which is connected to the solar battery. The different adapters allow for compatibility of several different models of MP3 players, PDAs, and cell phones. The hookup process for the charger is very easy. Simply attach the correct adapter to the end of the cable, connect the cable to the battery, and attach your electronic device. In those simple steps you are ready to start charging using the sun as your power.This is where it gets kind of difficult. To charge my iPod Mini and iPod Nano, I connected the battery and set the system out into the sunshine. After about 3 hours of direct sunlight the iPods were completely charged and were playing for their full length of time on a full battery charged by the usual electrical outlet method. The product website suggests charging time to be about 3-4 hours, which was pretty accurate to my experience with this product. The difficulty was that the system needs to be in direct sunlight. The product website assures customers that even on a overcast day the charger will charge provided it is bright; however, this was not the case in my experience. The first few days I attempted to utilize the system, there was a overcast sky and the charger kept turning on and off as the clouds moved into the path of the sunlight. Subsequently, the iPods did not charge even with increased time in the sunlight (about 6 hours).I attempted to charge the iPods inside my house through a window and also outside directly under the sun. With the setup and location of my house, I was unable to achieve a good charge inside the house, even in the location of most sun. I had to take the charger and iPod outside and set it directly under the sun in order for charging to occur. In this situation it is possible to listen to the iPod and charge simultaneously, but in other situations, enough power would not be generated to simultaneously charge and use the iPod.The charger comes in an assortment of 5 different colors. It is very small and compact (110x75x10mm) which makes it easy to pack up and take on any TDY. The website assures customers that it is water proof as long as it is not submerged. During the time I was using the charger, there was a little bit of rain which did not affect the battery, but as I have stated the charger did not work on the overcast day. There are three different kits sold for this product, one for iPod only, one for cell phone only, and one that is a combo of both. The kit I got is the iPod/cell phone combination.While the device is compatible with several different models of cell phones, the model of my cell phone is not one of them, so I did not get to explore this feature on the charger. However, if I am inclined to do so, I can purchase a $10 upgrade to make the charger compatible with my particular model of cell phone (additional adapters available here).Despite the difficulty in charging without direct sunlight, the product still does what it claims to do. If there is direct sunlight, the charger works great. It will most likely work without any difficulty during a sunny desert vacation; however, due to the sunlight sensitivity and the price of this product, it is not for everyone."

155454,2,I am a doctor and for quite a few years was a Polar distributor in my practice because I believed that Polar was a good company with good heart monitors. I purchased the Wearlink transmitter belt a few years ago. It only worked for a few weeks before it stopped functioning. I used the belt that came with the Polar heart monitor since then. Recently I noticed my old Wearlink transmitter and went on Polar's website and saw that they offer a replacement battery and cover but there was no place to actually purchase this on their website. I emailed them to purchase this replacement battery and and cover (I mostly wanted the cover because my was ruined by trying to remove it to see what kind of battery was required)and they refused saying that I must send my Wearlink in for repair. The cost of doing this is excessive and I think that if a person wants to try replacing the battery and cover themself they should be allowed to try before being charged excessive fees for a battery and having to pay shipping for a service that may not be required.

When it didn't show up, I emailed the seller about the status of my item (FYI, the tracking number they gave me tracked exactly NOTHING). I did not get a response until AFTER I posted negative feedback (they claimed to be in constant contact with me... they weren't). The seller said they had already shipped my item & blamed the post office for the delay. They did do the right thing & refunded my shipping.When I got my package on December 16th, I discovered the postage on the package was dated December 13th, which was the day my package was supposed to arrive. The delay had nothing to do with the post office being slow, the seller just hadn't shipped it.I hope mine was an isolated incident but buyer beware!"

280192,0,"Length:: 5:06 MinsUpdate August 26, 2008 -Those 2 people who found the review non-useful are right - I should have rated it a 1 - at some point I'll delete this review and change it to a 1 - that should make it more useful.Here's the rope I now recommend over the Buddy Lee Rope. It's better, cheaper, and ships more cheaply and more quickly.http://www.buyjumpropes.net/product_p/018.htmOn this rope, the clip that adjusts the rope length and secures the rope in the handle is plastic so it doesn't corrode and is easy to adjust -just don't get it too short. In the Buddy Lee rope the metal clip often wears through the handle leaving the handle useless. On this one, the rope goes into a recessed hole, so the plastic that bears the pressure of the rope is not just a thin layer of plastic and there is no metal-to-plastic contact. I'll be doing a video to illustrate all this.I have no relationship with Matt Hopkins although I have spoken to him on the phone about his site and about this rope and the fact I was planning to review it - and the objective reasons why.----------------I should really give this rope a 1 because it claims to be a speed rope, for which it's useless. I mention neoprene in the video, but it's actually PVC in all cases. The extra weight is quite noticeable and not desireable in a speed rope. I recommendMagic Speed Basic Jump Rope. For Children & Adults.. You can get replacement cords for $5.00 at the Buddy Lee site. There used to be a problem with the handles wearing through, but that seems to be fixed. As I mention in the video, the handles are longer and lighter, which is desirable, and it's much easier to adjust the cord length.I'm have no interest in promoting Buddy Lee ropes. I read an article in Business Week in about 2002 about Buddy Lee and that's what got me into Jump Rope. I was actually expecting to find something cheaper and will continue to review other ropes.The last time I checked out the Buddy Lee ropes with swivels the swivels would wear out unevenly and even when new one is nearly always smoother than the other. I'll be doing another review on that. Update - I spoke with Buddy Lee on the phone, and he pointed out that extra maintenance is the price of hi-performance and I have to acknowledge I wasn't keeping the swivels dry, so, for the extra performance they are probably worth it. I doubt I'm capable of being able to take advantage of it, so take that into account.Everything in this review also applies toValeo Speed Jump Rope"
310726,2,"Sigg Traveler Classic Water Bottle (0.6) / B000RI87UKUPDATE: One year after I bought this water bottle, I am deeply irked to learn that it has been discovered that Sigg's 'superior' and 'secret formula' bottle linings did, in fact, contain the chemical BPA in them. They are offering a ""free"" trade-in to their new, supposedly BPA-free bottles until November 2009, but I am deeply unhappy with the Sigg company for three reasons.1. Since they apparently never claimed to be BPA-free in the first place, they aren't legally required to offer a free recall, nor can they be legitimately sued for false advertising. But even if the claim was never explicitly made, there was always an implicit understanding that the Sigg bottles were ""safer"" than plastic bottles - and we ALL know what ""safer"" is supposed to mean. I'm not pleased with the deception.2. The ""free"" trade-in simply isn't - since it's not a recall, they won't provide shipping labels, so I had to chunk down $10 in postage to get my Sigg bottles to finally do what they were always SUPPOSED to do in the first place - be BPA-free.3. Since Sigg won't release their secret lining formula, there's no guarantee that their new liner is any safer than the old liner - even if they DID remove all the BPA this time, they could just as easily have replaced it with another dangerous chemical.Bottom line is, I'm now quite furious with Sigg and I frankly wish that I hadn't bought from them in the first place.~ Ana Mardoll"

Took it to a bike shop to have them look at it and said everything was jacked up, and that was certainly true. Another $40 to have it tuned and everything is well now. Brakes, gears.. good.BUT... THIS BIKE IS HEAVY! There's no getting around that. I didn't notice the weight stated on the description and just assumed it would be lighter than the tank it is.Also, frame size I got was 16"". I'm 5'8"" legs about 31"". Seat post is a bit long but I don't have to cut it like other posters.

437446,0,"I've only had this for a few days, but I have a fairly good feel for it. Here's what I like about it: (1) easy to relocate; (2) adjustable height. Things I find problematic: (1) It's too light. I weight 160lbs. Strong hooks (not that I consider my hooks strong) rock the entire bag lifting part of the base. Forget spinning sidekicks. The entire thing nearly topples. (2) The padding in the bag seems to easily indent. After a couple of solid 20-minute workouts, I can see where I've been striking the bag. The indentations don't seem to return to normal. (3) Because of #2, you have to have the bag in an open area so you can work around the bag. I purchased this over a hanging bag because I simply had no room. I should have purchased a better model/brand. I did get a free set of Tapout gloves because I went through Karate Joe's. There's that at least.Overall, if you aren't planning on pounding the bag, this might work for you."

163299,2,"After much research and reading many reviews we purchased this tent after many years using a similar style generic brand tent. We had high expectations of this tent being able to withstand high winds and rain. Although it set up very easily and looks nice, it failed us in everyway during a short thunderstorm.During a brief thunderstorm with some mild wind gusts in the midwest the tent rainfly, floors, and walls were saturated with water within minutes. We took in water from all sides (floor, walls, ceiling) of the tent. Even worse, was after the tent material became wet, the walls sagged horribly. This made the walls giant wind sails rather than spreading the wind up and over the tent. The walls blew in on themselves by more than 18 inches I'd say. We thought the tent was going to collapse. The zippers also caught themselves on the tent fabric 50% of the time.We have camped for years in much worse weather on beach campsites encountering severe high wind and rainstorms along the panhandle of Florida, the Outerbanks, and up in the mountains of Vermont. We are grateful we did not have this tent with us on any of these trips.We are shocked that such an expensive and highly regarded tent brand would perform so poorly. It was certainly not worth what we paid for it."

We have had the set for a whopping 6 weeks and already the Bear silkscreen is cracked and peeling off.

I was unhappy with both Yaktrax because the wires get stuck on carpet--a problem the Stabilicers don't have (I don't spend a lot of time wearing them indoors(!), but I did walk to work wearing them and found that they got stuck on carpet when I walked into the building, making weird noises and potentially damaging the carpet). I did some research online and next will order Spiky Ice cleats. These received rave reviews from winter runners/joggers on two different running websites and, according to the company's website, are praised by police and EMT workers. They're made in Europe, have been around for a long time, and reviewers said they stay on (even without straps), don't get caught on carpet, and are easy to drive in. They're available at [...], a company in Pennsylvania. The original (not ""Lite"") Stabilicers (available through Amazon and other sources) have great reviews, too, and have a strap to keep them on."
502897,0,"It's better than the bar, but it's still not that comfortable. I use a smaller bar from an older bench for squats, rows, etc. and it doesn't fit the bar tight. Looks like it would fit an Olympic bar fine, though."

285341,0,Hats are of decent quality.... but not great....Very Light-Weight Construction.For a few cents more - they could have made a much better hat.(I know my hats - I sell large custom orders - Direct from overseas... but my kids wanted these)for the Discounted Price I paid (and had to buy 3 in order to get free shipping)they were JUST OK....if they're NOT on SALE - you'd be crazy to pay $15-$20 for these....I paid I believe $10-$11 (which retail for a fitted cap is so-so)
445386,0,"I've had this umbrella for 5 years now.As an umbrella to use while raining:* Yes, this umbrella provides nice protection.* Even though Chicago is dubbed as the ""Windy City"" for political reasons, it really can get windy here. The open umbrella has never inverted on me.As for the product when it's not in use during the rain:* In my first week of owning it, I dropped it on the sidewalk once, and the wooden handle got dinged and chipped.* The silver metal rods have all come out of the black end caps, so I've had to superglue them back into place.* It's also a heavy and bulky umbrella. I cannot believe how much weight it adds to my work bag. I can barely zip it into my Longchamp Le Pliage."
92830,0,"Based on all the rave reviews on Amazon I purchased a Celestron 52250. I already have a Bushnell and was looking to step up. The Celestron at 20X has good image quality but once you go to the higher magnifications the image deteriorates dramatically. My advice, if you want a good scope, is spend a little more and get a Kowa."

83916,0,Look I have had one of these since 1992 and It still works fine. It does have a seven shot magazine located under the barrel. The grips can come a bit loose. What do you expect for $25? I bought it to train a gun dog and have fired hundred or rounds through it. The trigger pull is stiff because it is single action and the pull of the trigger also moves the magazine forward to the next blank. It works every time and i have never cleaned it. If you want a decent zinc metal blank gun buy it. If you want fancy movie prop spend the $100+ and get one.
267483,0,"Good size, nice and lightweight and simple -- but pretty poorly made. I used it for almost exactly a year and then it fell apart all at once, suddenly full of holes and frayed beyond use. A functional and cheap bag, but you get what you pay for. Don't expect it to last."
184384,0,"I would not necessarily recommend this to any beginners in spin class, which is the original reason why I bought it. It provides minor cushioning but perhaps I expected a little more than it was made for."
26565,2,"Let me start by saying I own a lot of Easton products and am, for the most part, very satisfied with the quality. With this specific product I cannot even come close to saying that. The tabs that hold the net in place broken very quickly and I needed to come up with a solution on my own. Now, after the unit was stored indoors all winter, every time you hit the ball into the net it tears a hole in it. I called Easton for assistance and they told me that first of all the net cannot be replaced alone, you need to replace the entire unit and secondly it comes with a 3 month warranty - to me that says you do not believe in your product. To say I am less than thrilled in an understatement"
253518,0,"I was choosing between these shirts and the ones from Old Navy for my job at Target. I already own one from Old Navy. I should've gone with the Old Navy ones since they're MUCH softer, these are made from heavy duty cotton and feel rigid. They're pretty baggy, and not fitted at all, definitely should have gotten a small. They're so long that they keep getting stuck in my PDA case at work. I'm 6' and weigh about 155 pounds. I wouldn't return them though, they're durable."

146078,2,"I purchased this as my first guitar slide. I loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. I almost cut myself! I will never buy a glass slide again, I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it. The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. I would not suggest this to anyone. The metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. There's a reason ALL pros use metal! The review below is wrong. Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger, all the way to the tip. You don't bend your finger to play slide. You retune your guitar to an open tuning. Just thought I would point that out."
499266,1,"I experienced series of bad DVDs and ended up returning/re-ordering 3 times. I even bought a new DVD player but the problems did not go away. The problems were for both Body Max 2 and Guts & Butts. So I gave 1 star review. Then yesterday I actually received replacement DVDs from Cathe Friedrich corporation herself. Well, I am very touched by that. God knows why I had so many technical problems. DVDs I ordered 3 times were actually unwatchable. I use Pre-Mix feature only. Does anyone have tehnical problems when using this feature? Problems such as frozen image, skipping and eventual blank screen? It's bad.Aside from technical problems, I remain dedicated to this DVD and Cathe Friedrich's programs. I just hope I don't experience any more problems."
485062,0,the bars were definitely comfy. my only issue was they stuck out to wide aestetically for my liking. perhaps a inch or two off the bar ends and they would of been perfect for my road king.
387007,1,I only have good things to say about these. I have been thinking of getting another pair!(P.S. I wear them as arm-bands. I do alot of night-time walking)- These babies are BRIGHT!- They can be connected to each other to make one longer band- They are small (discreet) enough to carry in pockets/handbags until ready for use- They seem to be pretty durable
244327,1,"After about 2 years of pool, lake, and occasional beach use, the rubber in these are holding up surprisingly well (always rinse them in tap water). There's a large surface area where it contacts your face, so they don't need to be as tight. The Smoke color is dark enough to where people can't see your eyes, and works quite well in bright sun and not bad indoors/evening. Hands down, these are the best pair of goggles I've ever owned!"

249035,2,"The plates and bowls chipped the first time I used them. The mugs were already chipped when I got them. Even packing cloth between each plate and bowl didn't help. I love the silverware and the holder, keeps everything together."
279729,2,"This bag has a lot of compartments which is great. I wanted something to hold all my gear for work. Didn't like this bag at all. Actually sold it to a guy at work for 20.00 who liked it. Go buy a decent bag at your local store. Even a gym bag is better than this bag in my opinion. Was too stiff and narrow. Zippers were hard to utilize. Had to basically hold the bag down while zipping or unzipping.If you want something you wont need to get in and out of on a constant basis throughout the day then it is a great bag. If, like me, you needed a bag that was accessible whenever you needed it then I would look at getting a 5.11 tactical backpack."

22502,1,"Purchased Planet Bike's 3 LED beamer to announce my presence on the road for early before dawn and early evening rides. I have used the light in both modes.While this light won't light up everthing, it is quite adequate as I have used it before dawn. I had it in the blinking mode to announce myself to motorists and others on the road along with my blinking red tail light.In the steady mode it did assist in lighting up the path and it sure did illuminate the reflective signs on the roadway.This light is a great value for the price. So far it has been reliable and I have no complaints. I purchased an additional light so that my spouse would have one and that was the Planet Bike 5 LED model that was less than the 3 LED.I tried out both lights on one ride for comparison. While both lights are nice and work well, there really was no major difference other than 5 LED appearing a tad bit brighter and the 3 LED having a more solid beam.The only improvement Planet Bike should consider making is to the mount that comes with the light. I found the light has a tendency to slip out of place when traveling on a less than perfect road or path. To stabalize the light I used velcro straps, the type used to tie up computer cords, to secure the light on my handlebars.I have had these lights now for nearly 1 year and have no complaints as some reviewers have experienced such as water intrusion. While I don't ride in the rain, if I had to I would wrap the light in plastic."
472045,0,"The item is great, but the way they packaged it was HORRIBLE. They mailed it in a small envelope, folding it, causing 3 distinct creases. I emailed them and they did respond quickly with the advice to lay something heavy on it. I was pretty much already doing that. Anyway the creases were still there, but I wanted to see if when I applied it the creases could be smoothed out. They did not! I kept it assuming I could not return it since it was opened and used. Bottom line is that I will be very cautious about ordering from this company again."
263510,1,The watch is fantastic! I dont know why some people have complained about this watch.It arrived a few days early which was great.The display box is a work of art by itself.Everything was perfect.

281215,1,"These pants are a great length for teenagers, a nice surprise since I somehow missed ""youth"" in the title and bought these for an adult.

245037,0,"The long sleeve shirt shrunk a bit after washing and drying and is stiff and clings to you a bit unlike other similar shirts I have. It does wrinkle a bit and is just ""OK"" for the price.

211073,1,"These work very well for me. They do a good job of making a seal with my face. The anti-fog coating didn't last long, but I've never had any anti-fog coating really do what it is supposed to for long. Other than that, these are great."
396799,0,"The fairing comes with padded feed which stick to the bottom the plastic pieces that would otherwise touch the roof. After a few months, the padded feet gradually slid off center from melting glue. Trying to peel those off, clean things up and replace them wasn't worth the time for the limited difference in noise."
507247,1,"The UHC 1911 is great. I really like it. It has everything you need for a Spring Airsoft Gun. It has a working Hammer (doesn't do anything that envolves shooting just cocks back, just for realism and looks), Functional slide lock that actually locks it self,very accurate, dual safeties just like the real 1911. It has metal internals which gives the gun a nice weight and feel. It feels like the real gun! One thing that I didn't like about this gun is that its barrel is sort of flimsy, I mean you could twist it and it feels like its going to break.Overall, Its a great gun, a nice secondary pistol. Its very accurate and I would recommend this to beginner airsofters even intermediate airsofters. This gun is just GREAT!! BUY IT. you wont regret it!"
128427,0,"I think this is a great product. Yesterday I saw a man at the picnic day at UCDavis riding one with ease. They are a bit to over priced though. They would be great for college if you don't like bikes. And you can get attachments to carry all your books in. Plus, to carge it you just plug it into a regular outlet."
416565,0,"I bought this last Christmas for my 6yr old son. It was initially given a little interest. It is hard to use. I purchased a regular pogo stick for this Christmas and it has been one of the biggest hits. It has been played with daily and he is doing all sorts of tricks. I wonder sometimes whether we really need to reinvent the wheel? There is a reason that the pogo stick has been so successful, why try to imitate?"
508943,2,"I had high hopes for this bayonet. Well I guess I shouldn't even call it a bayonet. I had high hopes for this ""Bayonet Looking Knife"". That's better. Anyways regardless of how it looks the muzzle ring and locking mechanism while appearing to look like they're the right size will not fit a real life M-16. This ""Bayonet Looking Knife"" is also of a cheap construction and feels like the handle may break off eventually. But I guess what should you expect for a $16 ""Bayonet Looking Knife"" anyways? Regardless of this it is still a cool looking and decent and functioning ""Bayonet Looking Knife"" for only $16. So it wasn't a total loss. But I stress again ""THIS WILL NOT FIT ON A REAL M16""!"

442560,0,This is fine. I think the concealment capabilities are over emphasized. It is nice that it sits horizontally but the stock Glock magazine carrier is far easier to conceal - at least for a more slender build. Is is perfectly serviceable but I was surprised how bulky the material is. I'll keep it but I'm using the stock carrier day-to-day.
307509,0,"I don't care if $60 is on the low end of gun cases, Plano could have spared 10 cents to glue their foam padding into the case, rather than have it fall out every time you open it. Furthermore, I wasn't able to fit two rifles in there, let alone with scopes (it was an M-4 with Aimpoint on one side, a Remington M700 with 3-9x40 on the other). Returned to Amazon."
153667,0,"They have an odd chemical smell that has not disappeared after the first wash. As far as comfort goes, they are great."

143958,0,"I picked the Fireman because the exact tool set up I wanted was not offered, the Fireman was close, but I did not really want the seatbelt blade.The seatbelt blade adds thickness and weight that I did not want.Both blades were a bit dull out of the box, but took a very good edge.If not for the extra thickness of the ""extra"" blade I would give this knife at least 4 maybe 5 stars.Its just pushing the limits of pocket carry, it would be best to use a belt sheath setup with this one.Its not fast to open or close, but it is a ""one hand knife"" I think this is a knife you should handle in peron before buying, but its a good knife."
423179,2,After i bought this wire i saw i can get it for $42.00 locally.But the wire itself is good but the price is way too high.

193719,0,"Don't get me wrong; this is an OK knife and a good value. But it does not measure up to other Victorinox cutlery.The Good: This is a sharp paring knife with a handle length that fits me. The blade length is handy for many small jobs. It is the least expensive knife in my kitchen. The textured handle is an improvement over the hard plastic of the Kuhn Rikon knives. Made in Switzerland (so marked on the sleeve, not the knife).Dings: The blade is thinner than myChicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition 3-Inch Paring/Boning Knifeor my Wustof Emeril 4-1/2"" utility knife. It's a tad thicker than myKuhn Rikon 4-Inch Nonstick Colori Paring Knife, Black. The handle is thinner than any of my similar knives, which makes it less than ideal for my grip.Inferior to other Victorinox knives: Handle of hard plastic rather than fibrox. Thin blade. Blade finish not as nice as theVictorinox Swiss Army 10-1/4-Inch Fibrox Wavy Bread Knife, Blackor theVictorinox Swiss Army 8-Inch Fibrox Straight Edge Chef's Knife, which absolutely gleam.Summary: At this price point I don't know of a better paring knife. Just don't expect it to measure up to more expensive tools."
211081,2,"I bought this after reading zillions of positive amazon product reviews. I would term my face a normal size female face. These goggles are super-tight and leave deep impressions on my skin.

161541,1,"This watch is all glitter and shine and that's no bad thing. Nice dial. Nice size. Overall very attractive. The only downside is the watchband is slightly less robust than it could be and the gold may scratch on the band over time. However bearing in mind the price of this watch (forget the RRP - bears no relation to anything - some TV marketing ploy) then the watch is really good value, and if the gold on the band does not scratch over time then it will prove to be exceptional value,"
429507,1,"I just received the stepper a week ago or so, and geeze, this thing is brutal on your legs! That's a good thing, by the way. It means that those leg and butt muscles are getting one hell of a workout. So far I can *almost* stay on it for 10 minutes before I scream bloody murder and hobble over to the couch.Keep in mind I'm by no means in bad shape. I workout almost every day, doing either mixed martial arts + cardio or strength training + cardio. However, the way that steppers isolate the exercise to the legs & glutes makes for one seriously painful workout if you haven't targeted them specifically prior to getting one of these things. I'm looking forward to the continued challenge this provides, and extending the time I can stay on it. I get the feeling it's really going to make a big impact visually in a relatively short period of time, judging by how sore you get on these things!"

137770,0,"I am a huge collector of Pittsburgh Pirates hats. I have 17 different, and some how this is the one that I love the most. I wear my old one all the time, and I can't take it out in public... you know how it is with old hats.I can only rate this a 3 out of 5 though because this is the one hat that is impossible to be 100% happy with because in 20 years I've bought 6 of this hat alone (it's my favorite), and each has been a slightly different color, and that kind of frustrates me as to which is the TRUE color of the time. This one is Bright Yellow, I bought one that was much darker last time, and the one before that which I'm wearing now was somewhere in the middle. So it's by no means the dealer's issue. They did an amazing job, and it was one of the FASTEST deliveries I've ever had from Amazon, or eBay for that matter. I would happily buy from this vendor again. Especially if I can find the Yellow Pirates' Painter's cap with the black stripes. I have the black one, and they'd make a great pair."
27610,0,"I have had this watch for about 4 years. Unlike other reviewers I have not had any problems with the crystal scratching. The numbers on the outer bezel have started to wear off, but I do not use it as a calculator that often. Mostly just for converting knots to MPH or KPH.The UTC dial on the face is handy and if you are in the Military (like I am it is essential)You CAN NOT set time zones in half-hour increments and that is a minor pain. Also the watch SHOULD automatically set time zones for Daylight Savings time and turn it off when the proper date arrives.The luminous hands are hard to read in the dark after an hour or so, but again a minor pain. A backlight on the led portion would be awesome.I have been swimming (pools as well as the ocean) with this watch and never had a problem with fogging.Overall this is a great watch and I wish I could have bought mine for this price....I paid $500 a just a few years ago."

I understood Juniors to mean teenage girl age. As a 20 year old girl, I can easily wear a M/L in these shorts for Juniors/adults. When I got my package, I received a Youth Large instead. I had to give the shorts to someone else who could wear them because I needed them on a time crunch. This is a good brand, just a little confusing on the description."

475780,1,"The grip arrived early. I put it on my M&P; 15-22 and it looked great! The bipod deploys and retracts with ease, almost too easy.I can only come up with 2 negatives about this bipod after using it. When I took it out to the range, it was hard to use because it was so tall. I had to use several bags on the stock to level the gun out. Unfortunately this is almost necessary with the long mag that the 15-22 uses. The second thing is that it is a little wobbly. When the bipod is deployed the legs move a little bit, almost like it is on a ball joint where it is connected to the grip. It's not too bad, but after shooting straight off the sand bags, you can definitely tell a difference. Other than that it is great.At Gander Mountain I messed around with the bipod grip that Fab Defense makes.Fab Defense Vertical Foregrip With Bipod Md: TPOD., and I am glad I got this one instead. The FAB Defens bipod is a lot heavier, and the grip actually splits as part of the bipod. I pinched myself twice at the store just messing with it! This will not happen with the Milsim grip. The other bipod did have some adjustment for the height of the bipod that would be nice, and is definitely more sturdy. But it was also 10X MORE EXPENSIVE! A little to much to convince me I needed it.I think this grip will hold up pretty well on most rimfire and varmit rifles. It may only be plastic, but with a just little care you shouldn't have any problems. And as a grip you shouldn't have any problems at all.I would definitely recommend this product, but you should know it's few short comings. It is good enough for my purpose, and for the price, you can't beat it!"

I am getting nipple chafing again at those distances. I plan on taking the stick with me to the treadmill next time I run and experimenting with reapplying at the 5 mile mark and see what happens. I was extremely happy with this stuff at first, but now that my mileage has increased I'm getting iffy about it."

I made a table top out of some scrap 1/4"" plywood I had to span the top. That provided a surface to place the stove on, but the real issue is that the stand wobbles a great deal. When pumping up the stove the stand was all over the place. I'll be looking for a better solution longer term."

413658,0,"Let me start by saying that I am a chubby white girl with two left feet, not a lot of coordination, and no rhythm, so I probably had no business trying to do this DVD in the first place. I normally use Turbo Jam, and I love it, so I thought this would be a nice companion DVD. Gotta say, this DVD didn't work for me at all. Let me stress, it's a good workout DVD. I had such a hard time getting the routines down (and I didn't have that hard of a time getting the Turbo Jam routines down, but this is a little bit of a different approach) that ultimately, it wasn't a good workout for me.I really liked the instructor. He was enthusiastic, encouraging, and a great dancer. He was motivating and fun. He's a little 'drag queen' at times, but he was an amazing dancer, and he does make you want to try harder. It was because of him, and him alone, that I didn't give up right away. I actually tried this DVD 4 or 5 times before giving up and going back to my Turbo Jam.My problem was that I just couldn't get the routines, and I felt really dumb trying to do this workout. He goes slowly at first, and I would learn the routine, but when we tried to do the dance in ""real time"", I got lost. Since I am not a dancer, it was very hard to integrate the 'tilt, tuck, and tighten' technique. I'd realize right at the end that even though I was starting to barely grasp the routine, I hadn't been doing the 'tilt, tuck, and tighten' because I'd been concentrating so hard on the arm and leg moves. So this workout didn't make me sore, nor did it work my abs. I did break a sweat, but I think that was more from frustration than the exercise moves.These also aren't moves I would ever want to use at a club, even if I could dance. These aren't real hip hop dance moves (and I would know as my sister is a dancer and choreographer), these are watered down workout video dance moves. Even though the music wasn't actual hip hop, I still liked it and the set seemed like a classy version of a dance club rather than the usual workout video standard 'dance studio set' or 'nicer-house-than-I-will-ever-own set'. Overall, this DVD had very polished production values. The set was really cool, the other instructors (more on them later) were beautiful and cool, the costumes/lighting/music were all top quality. I got an overall feeling, though, that this DVD was a lighter, fluffier version of a real hip hop workout, which made it all the more frustrating that I couldn't get the moves down.Getting back to he other instructors - they were beautiful, cool and well dressed, but they looked really awkward at times doing the routines. Seeing their awkwardness, I kept thinking that if they looked uncoordinated and silly doing these moves, and they're beautiful, how stupid do I look? But I pressed on, and kept on trying to get the routines, and the DVD went fairly fast as each routine was well sequenced, and overall, there was good flow.This DVD wasn't a good fit for me. If you're a pretty good dancer, appreciate good production values, don't mind feeling a little silly doing these moves, and want a DVD that's a cute, fun dance workout, this may be the DVD for you. It certainly wasn't for me."
31812,1,There is room for two large handguns or four small ones. It has a place for a padlock and two latches. It is sort of flimsy but it is good enough for traveling to the range and back. I wouldn't trust it as checked luggage on an airline. It's good for the price though.

26677,2,"Unfortunately Easton has 'struck out' on this net. I used it for 3 seasons and it just wouldn't fold up correctly after about the 4th time. the wieght of the net and poles along with the cumbersome/awkward setup makes this net a failure from day one. As a coach I would advise against this net. I got it on a deal for 69.99 but it wasn't worth the many headaches I experienced. Also, if my son would soft toss to me it would barely hold up to my swings and I by all counts am a doubles hitter not a homerun hitter. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for your portable batting needs. There is a reason this product gets so many 3 star or less ratings."
313242,0,good product but I agree with others that the outershell is not the same heavy duty vinyl it used to be. I would suggest they supply a nice tyvek cover for it to avoid damage from other products in the freezer.
399972,0,"A rear view mirror is a MUST for anyone riding with traffic.That said, I concluded some time ago that the eyeglass mounted mirrors have some serious tradeoffs. If you choose to not wear a helmet (I'm not going to go there) then an eyeglass mount is your only option. On the other hand, I found that the mirror interfered with the helmet straps, and it was also annoying to have the weight and vibration on my glasses. I wear very light metal frame glasses so it's probaly more pronounced than if you had big honking plastic frames. Also, if you're wearing non prescription glasses it's not as bad.The only advantage the eyeglass mount has is that it puts the mirror closer to your eye and therefore you can get a larger view. On the other hand, I find the position to be better primarily in a more upright position. Putting the mirror on my helmet gave me a better mirror position for when I was on the aero bars or drops.HELMET mirrors are NOT for everyone as they do require some getting used to. It took me at least 2-3 rides before I got used to it. I've been using one since 2003 and do not feel safe without one.Helmet mirrors do a better job as you can still have a blind spot with the bicycle mounted mirrors - I have my helmet mirror set so I can see my shoulder and the side of my head. This gives me a clear view of traffic behind and to my right. By turning my head 30 degrees to my right, I completely ""sweep"" to all lanes on my left side.I've tried this and the Blackburn helmet mirror. This one is definitely better.MINUS- Does not remove (the Blackburn pops off the base so you can remove it offroading, for example. Don't lose it!)PLUS- Shorter arm is stiffer than Blackburn (it's an I-Beam section)- Adjustment range is better than Blackburn- Lighter mirror vibrates less than BlackburnNote: The helmets I have used them on are the Giro Atmos, Giro Animas, Bell Forza II and Bell Phi IIIf you've found this review helpful, please let me know!"

As a metronome, however, it leaves much to be desired: (1) the volume is not adjustable and I consider it not loud enough, (2) it makes a cheesy electronic chirp instead of a mechanical-sounding knock as some of the electronic metronomes can, and (3) the rhythm is ""dotted,"" i.e., it puts a milder electronic chirp in between the ""main chirps"" and there's no way to turn it off (but this can be somewhat remedied by setting it to 1-4 time)."

351264,0,"At $270 I seemed to have gotten a pretty good deal. Upon opening the box I realized that I have gotten a light weight bike for a great price. The complicated parts were already assembled, so I basically just put the wheels and the handles together. There were some minor problems thought, for example, I had to readjust all the brakes and handles because the factory setting was not all correct.The first 2 weeks were fine, when I was still testing the bike mainly through leisure riding. Problem came when I started commuting with it in the 3rd week. First it was the left pedal falling off. I have been able to put the left pedal back, but a week later the rigth pedal also fell off, with the inside threads in the crank bar completely gone. I almost got hit by a car when I was working hard to accelerate after a red light turned green. The cheap crank set was as if it was made of plastic, that it provided no strength at all. Eventually I have to had the crank set replaced. There are also some other annoying problems, for example, if I gear down while going up a ramp I can end up tossing the chain off the pulleys. The front gear is also problematic, as it only shifts between gear 1 and 3 - it never gets into correct position #2.Now I get used to the weaknesses of the bike so I am enjoying it better, although I wished I have bought one of those $400 commuter bike from a real bike shop. I wish this bike used more sturdy parts - at this price most people would not expect the bike to be a great performer, but it should have hold itself together much better than those $50 department store bikes."

Yes, it is great for retention but if I ever need to use my weapon I wouldn't want to have to fight with my holster to get it out!Also, something about the material left a 'grey' residue on my gun anywhere that it touched (even just from the retention strap). A rep from the company told me it would go away with time; well call me 'OCD' but I like my gun to look good too!"
356397,2,"Our family is all naturally large people. We set up this hammock and tightened is according to instructions. My nephew was the lightest at about 140 lbs, so he was the guinea pig to test the hammock. He sunk straight through to hit almost bottom. His body was folded up at the waist, and he was almost unable to heave himself out of the hammock.For grins and giggles, I sat in it. Mind you, I am a large woman, about 200 lbs, and I hit rock bottom, and simply got stuck in the darn thing. It was hilarious - a riot! We had a great time packing the sucker up and selling it for almost half price on Craigslist. Why did we not return it? Because we had had it for a year before we unpacked it and sat it up....This product is very flimsy, and awkward overall."

222954,2,"Lots of good reviews for this excercise ball prompted me to buy it.But the box it shipped in said 75cm, the ball I received was 65cm at most - I know this because I bought it to replace a 75cm TKO ball that said 75cm right on the ball, but the Max Fitness ball says nothing about size on the ball itself. This ball may even be smaller than the 65cm Giam ball I bought for my wife.I opted to return this ball for a refund and go with what I know ... TKO, at least they're smart enough to mark their balls by size unlike Max Fitness, who set themselves up for Murphy's Law vulnerability by being naive enough to think their Chinese factory isn't going to mix the sizes up due to lack of size marking.Footnote: My TKO ball was great and lasted a very long time and I'm happy to buy another. It only developed a slow leak after being played with at length by 2 young cats with very sharp claws."
115454,0,"These are cut a little big, and that's pretty typical for a rain jacket. It feels rubberized to the touch, and does keep you very dry. There are air vents under the armpits small enough that they should't let water in-- great feature. There are also two huge pockets on the front to keep items you need to keep dry.The only thing I don't like about this jacket is that it makes a lot of plastic noise. If you're out in the rain, this doesn't matter, but any time it's not raining you're going to be ""loud"".If I am going to be wearing a jacket for rain purposes I would personally prefer the Columbia Omni-tech or Titanium Tech jacket. Far more stylish, quieter, and better ventilation, at more cost."

I do, however, think this is a natural rubber mat, but it has undergone some special processing to make it very smooth.Not only did I slip around on this mat, but after a week of use it actually began to disintegrate under my feet. Each time I used it, more and more rubber came off until it got to the point that I had a purple pile of rubber bits on the floor after each practice.In Gaiam's defense, I sent them an email explaining what had happened. They sent me a new mat (a different kind, which I thought was interesting) and I've liked it much better. It's organic cotton and natural rubber and feels nothing like this one. [...]"

51827,2,"As most of you have pointed out, this game seriously dissapoints. I'm not sure if the game is different in other platforms, but my PS2 version from last year was head and shoulders above this 360 game. As usual, I buy this game the very 1st day it comes out, it has never dissapointed like this. They have pulled out so many great features from last year's version and added nothing...seriously they have added nothing...""momemtum"" is a joke. What about the ""toughest places to play""? Gone. What about the composure and player ability ratings? Gone. Rowdy fans with signs? Gone. Actual stadiums for all teams? Gone. Crazy player celebrations? Gone (or at least I can't figure out how...it's not like that would be needed in the instructions, or anything else for that matter). So after losing all of that, you would expect the graphics would more than compensate...wrong! I could not tell the difference. Check out NBA 2k6, there's a 360 game that blows you away with graphics. This is a waste of money....I will never buy this game again without renting it first. You blew a dynasty with this one EA!!!"

72805,0,"This company will not ship to Canada! How dumb.The ""World Rugby Shop"" on-line store charges US$20.00 to ship to Canada - a rip off!

After filling the claim, the seller contacted me and said they just received my email. They told me that if I dropped the claim, they would reship my order via US mail so it wouldnt be left on my doorstep again. I agreed and dropped the claim. A month went by, I never received my order and the seller never replied to any attempt I made at contacting them."
247894,2,"Another commenter here said that they bought this from Fox Racing and the expiration date was 2005. I bought this same item from this same seller just now, and there's no date on it at all.When these are made, they have a date on them. Many online merchants remove the date - or to be fair, it may well be the merchant's supplier that removed the date. I've seen several merchants explain that they get these from so many sources that it's impossible for them to make any claims about any dates at all. Fair enough. However, if just one frickin merchant would stick to making such claims, and would sell filters that aren't expired, they would get ALL the business. (And then immediately run out of stock probably :)I'm knocking off two stars because I have to assume it's expired and thus no longer NBC protection. I'm knocking off an additional star because someone removed the date altogether."
140334,0,"I've only been using this for two days, so maybe this won't count for much, BUT my initial thoughts are that for someone looking for a fun, motivating program, this isn't it. I'm not talking about all the folks who can motivate themselves to work out. I'm talking about people like me, who typically exercise for a month, and then watch tv for nine months before getting back to it. The Wii Fit programs are at least more entertaining, although I can say those programs got old over time, as this one certainly will. As far as this program, I of course, started out on 'easy', and the first day's workout was easy. The second day was harder - but it was suppose to be a mix of upper and lower body, and creamed my lower body with lunges and high-kick running, but didn't do as much as I wanted for upper body. I haven't had any trouble with the nunchuck being in the leg strap, other than the wire occasionally getting in the way while using the resistance band. It is awkward to move between exercises when you have to stop and put the nunchuck in the leg strap, or take it out, or get the resistance band in place. Since it can use the Wii balance board, it seems it should use it more (maybe it will eventually) - take advantage of the capability. My round of exercises on the first day used the board twice, and not very effectively. The second day's round didn't use it at all. I did have issues on the second day with the program recognizing when I was moving my arms up or down. AND, I ran off to the bathroom during a tutorial video, thinking the program wouldn't start until I pressed a button ... it did start without me, and my character had already done a rep by the time I got back - that's not impressive. Your motivation to keep at it are graphs and trophies. I find it amusing that the ""Half Way There"" Trophy is awarded at 10 out of 30 days (30 days being your big goal - to complete 30 days of workouts). Overall, if you are self-motivated to exercise, this program will probably make a nice addition to mix with your other workouts. I do so wish someone would make a really fun and entertaining workout program for those of us who need extra impetus. Bring on Raving Rabbids Aerobics or something. And please get rid of these lame trainers. I've generously given this three stars - it more or less does what it was made for."

177901,1,"I was in need of a product that would a) take care of my two bikes, b) not require screwing hooks, etc. in the walls and c)look at least half-way decent in my apartment. I got all that with the Swagman Hang It Bike Hanger. It was easy to set up and it is easy to put the bikes on and off the rack. I created more floor space (vs the bikes standing side-by-side) and it actually looks good in my city apartment. I'd recommend this anyone with similar criteria as I have. (Good price too.)"

138447,0,"I bought this product to remove two limbs that were 9"" to 10"" in diameter and about 20 feet off the ground. The saw portion of this product is pretty good as it made quick work of the limbs (5 minutes of cutting each -not including repair time... I thought it would take longer).However, the construction of the ropes and weight isn't very good. The clip provided to attach the throwing weight to the rope was very flimsy and broke on the second use. This was not a big problem as the clip was easily replaced with a dog chain clip that is strong enough for the job. The second issue that I had was more severe. When pulling on one of the ropes, the aluminum clip used to fasten the rope back on itself (where the rope attaches to the saw) broke and the rope (which was under some tension at the time) came flying back at me and very nearly hit me in the face. Again, the problem was easily fixed by using a knot to tie the rope back on itself. However, to do this I had to set up a ladder so that I could retrieve the saw from the branch it was stuck in (this part was not so fun).Overall, I would say it is an ok product, but for $40+ they shouldn't have skimped out on the throwing weight clip or the rope attachment points. Anyone buying one new may want to repair these weak points BEFORE using the product. Other than that, I thought the product actually worked surprisingly well."

298508,1,"The Gerber folding shovel is really top notch. Its quality construction is much like any other Gerber/Fiskars equipment I've owned - it doesn't disappoint.The shovel I have is actually a little more agressively pointed than in the pictures, so I'm not sure if Gerber has addressed this as an issue or if the pictures were off.The top of the handle is high density polycarbonate plastic and has a horizontal design like a spade should have. You can still use the verticle part of the steel handle if you wish, but there isn't much of it. The plastic will absorb some shock compared to steel-only, and it won't freeze to your hands, etc. The polycarb handle folds down on itself, so that it actually has 3 segments (instead of several designs which have 2 segments). This means you can stow the shovel in the included cordura nylon belt pouch which is no bigger than the shovel head itself. The handle pivot point locks and since it's square, doesn't rotate or twist easily. The steel which connects the blade to the handle fits nicely inside the A angle cutout of the handle, so when collapsed it is really thin.The blade is high quality steel with the hinged handle connected at the top. This does limit the depth of the shovel a little, but I don't believe it's much of a factor, except maybe in really solid soil where you lose a little verticle travel when the ground butts up against the hinge.It's very compact, light, comes with a solid belt sheath (easily convertible to pack carry) and stows away easily since it's so thin. I can put it in the side pockets of my doors or in the very small space above my rear wheel well without any problems (Trailblazer 4x4).I really can find no fault with this item, it delivers on all fronts: usability, quality, compact storage, and rugged design. I will almost certainly be keeping one in both cars and in my 72 Hour survival kit. They are even reasonably priced. 5 Stars."

I tried it on and it fit really well according to the actual game character's costume does, however I don't think cheerleading leotards are built for girls like me with a rather large and heavy bust, so it tends to be tight around the neck from the breasts making the fabric pull. Other than that the 2X isn't bad. I'm looking forward to modifying this excellently crafted material to suit my needs."

33077,1,"I thoroughly enjoy these pants. I've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities. These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I've been through - including 5.11, Woolrich, etc. I think the best feature on these pants - which isn't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side (for me, the strong side). This pocket, placed directly behind the front pocket (and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer's) has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached. The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size, such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis. My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over. These are great."

209320,1,"Welp, it's been cold as a witch's tooth out here in Western NY. Not as cold as normal, but still enough to make you lay in front of the hot oven with the door wide open after a shower, which I've done alot this winter already. (Sorry, Mailman! That was quite a scare.) One thing that always drives me crazy about winter is my poor freezing hands.When I was a boy, you'd see girls wear mufflers to church on Sundays. They were furry little purse-like things to warm their hands, usually made of an animal hide. I'm from the depression era, so we never wasted a thing. Some of the little girls at our church had mufflers made of mink or rabbit, but my sister had the prettiest marmalade colored muffler in town and that's because Dad skinned one of our cats to make hers. I'll never forget it because Mittens was my favorite cat and I know he was sick and all, but a part of me died that day when dad took the axe to him. In church the next week I saw a whisker fall to the ground from the muffler, and it was all I could do to keep my composure and not cry like a little sissy boy. Dad said his precious girl would always have the best, and we knew that was true because the year before he'd made her the most beautiful slippers from our cow, Mr. Beef. That was one sad Christmas. No milk with our dinner at all.Anyway I was thinkin about those mufflers recently when I was dropping off clothes at the Salvation Army. Unfortunately the people who ran the place wouldn't let me in. Apparently there was a misunderstanding regarding my hands. You see my hands were so damn cold that they locked into place witha crippling arthritis but the kids running the store were terrified because they thought I was making gang signs at them. I don't understand what the problem is with these young idiots today. I'm an old man who just wants his discount coffee at the local McD's. I haven't got time for this bloods and crips nonsense.However the experience did make me think about finding some better way to warm my hands. Up till then I was using winter gloves. Then one of my buddies gave me one of these hand muffs. To answer your question, yes, it IS ugly but I don't even care. This thing is warmer than any gloves I've ever tried and I use it to store all kinds of things, from chapstick, mints, cigars, my wallet, airline tickets, lottery tickets, gumballs,stick gum, regular gum, moustache wax, spare change, rubber bands, paper clips, receipts, vicks vapor rub, shopping lists, toothpicks, buttons, needle and thread, my yoyo, birdseed, antibacterial soap, bar soap, glasses case, binoculars, extra socks and my lucky penny. Daily medications, heimlich maneuver poster (laminated wallet size), sweatband, the furminator and my gym whistle. This thing can hold it all, plus my hands. It is warm in there! My hands are never, ever cold. Sometimes people seem suspicious of me but I try not to take it personally. One guy told me I'm like an elderly Richard Simmons. That one hurt. I slapped him pretty hard. He'll never do that again.If you're looking for something to warm your hands and provide you with storage on your person, this muffler is the thing!!! I use the handwarmers and have also gotten into the full length body warmers so I no longer need to use the oven throughout my day. I recommend this thing!!!! The camoflauge one is very masculine and I've heard that Matt Lauer and Bruce Willis both use these things while running errands so there's no need to feel ashamed. FIVE STARS on this one folks!!!!! (ps The orange one is very unattractive and looks like a pumpkin is sitting in your lap. Don't do it!!!!)"

321497,2,This item was poorly thought out it has too small of a regulator or hose orfice on it to put out any flames like the picture on the box. Flame lenghts are only a few inches long. It looks like a range burner under bad quality ceramic logs that are very fragile. It puts out little heat not at all like a campfire. The hose is short. Modifications to this unit put the cost up above what a better quality unit would have cost. Buy a better quality unit!

I was told to mail in the defective latch(at my cost) I did and after 8weeks still no word from them. When I finally got a hold of them I was told that I should of never sent the latch in. Finally I got them to agree to giving me a refund. I mailed the cooler with a copy of my receipt to them 6weeks ago and I have not heard a word from them, whenever I call there I get put on hold for 15 min then sent to a voicemail box that is full. A few more things to point out, the steel that surrounds this is very thin and cheap, and the logo on the lower right hand corner was poorly installed and falling off when I took it out of the box.

It is too big for my purpose, but would work great as a camel pouch for an avid outdoorsman or athlete. It sweats so it needs insulated to keep things cool/warm. I fill mine half way and freeze it overnight to put in my cooler. When going out with the kids, I freeze it and take it with us instead of buying water."

105042,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
110962,1,"Throw away that cheap board and spend a few extra bucks for this one. You will get fewer bounce outs and your darts won't fall out.This is a quality board with superb craftsmanship. It hangs easily. The bars are embedded and not popping off the surface.The only con I can think of that would be worth considering is that this is a very heavy board that hangs from one screw. It is about 11 concentrated lbs. We wondered if our wall could handle it, but, so far, so good. Care should be taken in choosing a spot to hang it.I would buy another, but I may never have to. This should last us a very, very long time. Unlike the board we got at a local big box store."
155180,0,"I love the double seam because I have issues with seams that ride up uncomfortably. I've purchased all colors of these and in a few different sizes. The red medium is the same as the large white (women's). The blue and black mediums are smaller than the large white/medium red. These do not have a cotton crotch and the material is very thin, like pantyhose (in fact, they run easily and have to be treated delicately and washed in detergent without any bleach whatsoever), so they leave absolutely nothing to the imagination. I don't recommend getting these too tight, especially if you're riding a bike because they are so thin that as you bend over, there's no privacy whatsoever. Again, they are very comfortable and I love them, but I wish the material were more durable. They are priced correctly, I think."
210742,0,"Even the blue one, which is supposed to be an extra strength band, doesn't provide that much resistance. It sort of works if you grasp it far from the end (essentially to shorten the band), but I wish it were stronger. When I watch youtube videos of Pilates exercises, the bands they use seem to be much stronger because people are holding them near the ends. And there I was holding it almost a quarter of the way down each end.I guess this is why you don't buy the cheapest product out there. There's a reason why it's cheap."

261032,2,"Please don't make the same mistake I did. The picture is completely misleading, this is just for the top piece. I was really surprised when I got home and saw the box was so small. The seller should really represent the item in a better way, or have in the description that this is for the top piece only. I'm very disappointed that I didn't get the entire set. Guess I should have gone to the website for MTM instead of just looking for maintenance kits on amazon. Please don't let my mistake be your."

494870,1,"This product is the best. Far beyond expectations as far as sturdiness. I am 280LBS at 6'2"" and this thing doesn't budge. It's super sturdy I've had it built for a little over a month now (even though I purchased it a year ago) and been abusing it. No bolt tightening needed so far. I would recommend this to anyone who has room for it. I guess if I were to improve it, it would only be the instructions. Be mindful of some of the instructions, it's all illustrations. Can be tricky. I had to remove a whole connection just to do it the right way which wasn't properly depicted on the picture."
321848,1,"The first thing I did was bring this watch to a local Tag dealer to verify its authenticity. It is a real tag. I was very skeptical buying from an unauthorized dealer. However, I took my chances (of course hoping that if it was a fake I would get my money back). The cheapest I could get it from a local authorized dealer was $1700 and that was because I knew someone. Without that it was $1850. So, after taxes I saved over $500!!! This is my first Tag, so I really cannot comment on the accuracy or its perfomance or anything like that. In my opinion this is the finest watch Tag makes. You may have a different one. I am just writing this because a review like this would have helped me feel safer in its authenticity. So, you can trust that this site sells real stuff!! And the shipping was super fast too!!!"
276945,0,"THe machine seems generally well made and i bought it primarily for my wife who is using it. Two things I don't like personally: the digital readout never really turns off, there is no switch, and the battery life will be lessened; Point two is that even the stiffest setting will not challenge fit people and they might want to consider a more challenging machine. It also takes up a large horizontal space and since folding it is not much fun, it will have to stay in the middle of the floor most of the time. I can fold it but shee will not."
286253,0,"I have not used this bokken to strike other bokkens, so I cannot testify to it's strength. But given the quality of the other parts, I wouldn't expect it to hold up. There is a slight curve in the wood, which is not enough to throw off the balance, but disappointing nonetheless. The chord wrapping on the handle was very poorly done - it was very loose, and kept sliding off. The only method used to ensure that the handle wrap stays attached is two lines of gum/residue under each thinner side of the handle. I ended up taking the wrap off and re-wrapping it myself. Finally, the guard is also fairly loose despite the provided rubber ring used to secure it in place. I found superglue to be very helpful in helping fix the above issues.TL;DRWhile this product is fine for practicing forms, I would not recommend it for serious sparring. Expect to make some modifications for comfortable use."
271979,0,"Nice, but far thinner material than an older identical style number. I was hoping for the heavier version but these will do for light duty. Minimal shrinkage in sleeves as well as overall length and width, but they WILL shrink."

471395,1,"I bought my Buff to wear while backpacking, and have found that it's suitable for all sorts of outdoor activities. It's easy to wear in so many ways (beanie for warmth, balaclava for protection during mosquito attacks, Sahara-style for ultimate sun shielding) and does well at protecting face and neck from sun and bugs. I wore the thing continuously during several days of hiking/backpacking and it seems to be high quality and is holding up just fine. It doesn't take the place of a simple bandana, which serves as a multi-purpose rag, but as a clothing accessory, it's easier to wear wider variety of ways than a bandana."

223767,1,So far this is the best $50 I spent on toys...It is not Kettler that is correct... but it is another brand by Kettler (company)...call 800 number listed in the manual and they tell you have reached Kettler customer service.1. Easy to assemble...2. Quality Built...3. Hard to Flip over(very stable)4. Rubberized tires (plastic but has rubber feel to it)5. Rear steering is nice...lock the front and steer with thepushbar...6. Canopy and rear bucket are very handy...Freewheel is not a big deal...My daughter keep her feet off the pedals...but she knows what to do so one day she will start pushing them ...I hope :)...For now Daddy is the engine...My daughter loves it...Paid $50 with the coupon...
117645,2,Product seems to work fine but the bottle top was damaged in shipping because the bottles were not protected properly... Shipper did not put any packing material in the box so the bottle slid around inside the box.. One bottle top was broken right off.... Therefore I will not buy anything from Amazon again... I tried to contact someone there but they keep themselves hidden from anything negative
256582,0,Got this for a seven year old to play with. He broke it within two weeks. They aren't really for actual practice I don't think but oh well.

401023,0,"I bought this bag for my son's sparring gear. Everyone has the same mesh bag and we couldn't tell ours apart. This bag is large and seems well made. It's easy to carry and a great color blue. The toggle to open/close the bag is super stiff and my 7 year old can't do it himself - which is a huge pain. He has this problem often with the fine motor skill stuff. I struggle with it too - so it's really tight. I might try and find a differt toggle to put on it. The other issue is that the velcro on the sparring gear sticks to the mesh of this bag - like glue. So it isn't working for a gear bag, and I'm going to look for another bag. I think this will be a good bag to take to the beach for sand toys. It's a pretty good size and will easily turn inside out to empty out sand. Most likely it will wash pretty well too. So my review of the bag is that it seems like a good quality bag, good color. Isn't ideal for my purposes so I'm giving it a 3."
332515,0,"It's a costume prop but maybe my expectations are a little high? When I'm judging my purchase off a picture I'd expect the item to look like the picture when it arrives. Overall the product is nice, the quality seems fine but it isn't what I purchased as it's missing the handguard. Poses a bit of an issue when that's the part that compliments the costume. Contacted the seller with no response. If you're looking to purchase this item and want the handguard I would not recommend this seller."
471429,0,"Wasn't too thrilled the ends of the material tend to roll, but all in all the product is nice. Many uses and light weight. On a hot day however if I'm wearing it over my face and have myGlasses on they tend to fog up. Still not sure if it's moreThe glasses fault or product."
376827,2,"very good design but too wide to get my Schwinn Protocol mountain bike fit in, and even scratched my forkreturned"
207070,0,Overall it does what it is suppose to. It is a target. Little smaller than I would have liked and I had an issue determining size when I ordered it. Ended up giving them to a fiend. Agan not bad but about the size of a hardback book if it was square.
85685,1,"I liked the price the most- only $99. Liked its portability, able to dis-assemble it into 3 small squares, to fold up and place in the back seat, or trunk of car. Easy to re-assemble. Cheap, easy to use, really no excuse not to bring it to every batting practice to protect pitchers and pitching Dads. Other similar models were from $169-over $300. A must for players older than 12YO and Dads who pitch BP of all ages."
10693,1,"These vests are well made, stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally. They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy. But being sleveless they don't make you sweat. The sizes are exactly as specified. I normally wear large in shirts and jackets, and the large vest fits perfectly."
363146,0,"The seal around the eyes works great and the quality is good, however the solid bridge on the goggle tends to rub on the bridge of my nose. Perhaps this will lessen if I get the tension on the straps figured out."
65934,2,"I am a diabetic, and knew that this portable exercise bike would be good exercise in the house. I have an exercise bike that I use in my garage, but the cold weather is the reason I recently purchased the FlyWheel. I realized immediately that the movements were jerky, causing my feet to slip from the pedals. Also, without the top straps, like on my full-sized exercise bike, I did not feel secure while pedaling.Even set at the loosest setting, I did not feel like the movements were fluid enough."
53347,2,"This pedometer is for real couch potatos! It is overly sensitive, even with the sensitivity adjustment turned down, so that it over-counts steps. This is most notable when worn around the house where it just doesn't keep an accurate count at all. It does work fine for walking for esercise, when you have a steady measured pace, but this isn't the time most people really want or need a pedometer....."
433153,0,It's very roomy and rugged. But the zipper constantly gets snagged. Not worth the money with flaws as important as zipper function.
296468,1,"Very well made rack that is plenty strong enough for anything I would carry on a bicycle, yet it is also very lightweight. Installation was simple on my 2007 Cannondale Bad Boy. Just hook up everything loosely at first, get the rack positioned and level, then tighten it down. Couldn't be simpler and there is plenty of adjustment available to get it to fit a multitude of bikes."
225373,1,"I have this under my desk at work. It provides a nice distraction from the work day. It is noisier than a magnetic resistance unit but not too noisy. You can carry on a conversation while using it. The resistance is adjustable from extremely easy to pedal to not very difficult to pedal. This is OK with me because I'm looking to burn some calories while sitting at a desk for eight hours, but I don't want to work up a stinky sweat. I have not used it above desk with my arms, but the pedals are small enough to grap with your hands. The unit can tend to slide on the floor if you let it get too far in front of you.It is easy to assemble and comes with all necessary tools. The LCD readout gives you an idea of what you have done, although I doubt the accuracy of the distance and speed. Still, it performs just as I expected. This is a good product at a good price."
296546,0,this BB is fine for onroad and light off road but it may be worth the extra 8 bucks for the UN54 which runs much smoother and is by far stonger.
356730,0,"Speedy delivery. The chair itself was in overall good condition. There were a few marks, scuffs, chips on the chair. I guess that is what you get when you order online and don't actually see it for yourself!"
442485,2,"This was my 2nd shortly wet suit ordered from Amazon (same brand). The first one was my size but was way too small. I ordered another larger one and it was the same size as the 1st one! If you had a rack full of different sizes in front of you and could try them on, you could probably find something that fits otherwise lots of luck. I'm 6', 175, and a 33"" waist, when a large is so tight you can't get it on something is way wrong. I found another brand locally and the ML as originally ordered fit perfect."
237993,2,"I thought I had finally found the perfect water bottle. It was made of a non-leaching material, it came in a larger size than the average water bottle, and the design was stylish. Unfortunately, it has not lived up to my expectations. Be sure to screw the cap on VERY TIGHTLY or you will have water all over your gym bag or car seat. Also, keep a firm grip on it at all times since it can not handle a fall to the floor without sustaining considerable damage. I dropped the bottle once and it is now dented on the bottom. The impact made the bottom pop out so now it wobbles on my desk. This is not a cheap product so I expected more from it- especially since I have only owned it for about three weeks!"
156444,0,"After dealing with tail bone pain from sitting for long hours, I thought this type of chair would be a good investment. This chair helps with that pain, but it causes my legs to get numb after a couple hours. Like others have said, it is fun at first, but it's still easy to slouch once you get used to it."

In my case, assembly was no problem whatsoever.Resistance - realistically not much adjustability and it is difficult to adjust w/ the rubber band adjustment under the seat rail.Workout - it is fine. Device is stable and heavy enough for my 190 pound[...]without moving around. Not too loud, either. I'm able to watch TV while rowing. Chain doesn't have any trouble staying in its tracks.

41065,1,"Hooked this charger up in about 30 seconds at 3:00 in the afternoon (running 10 amps) and my near dead deep cycle marine battery was charged the next morning. I'll definitely be mounting this permanently. Left it out in the rain today to make sure it's waterproof...and it is. Haven't hooked it up to the other battery yet, but I foresee few problems (see below) and will update if there are any.I did have one strange glitch: The charger has two lights; red and green. Red means charging, both means topping off/finishing, and green means charged/floating. When I first connected the charger to my battery only the green light lit up even though the battery was near dead. The trouble shooting section of the minimal manual says that this could mean an open circuit breaker/fuse, bad terminals/connections, or damaged cell(s). I figured the battery was toast, but went ahead and put a load on the battery (tried to start the boat) with the charger connected and it went immediately into ""finishing"" mode. I did this a couple more times and the charger eventually went into charging mode. Again, my battery was very low, so low I couldn't even turn the nav lights on, it took all night to charge once it did start working, and the boat starts right up now that it is charged, so I know this to be true. I am no master electrician, and have no idea why or how this happened, but maybe it will help somebody. If someone smarter than me does know, please explain it to me in the comments section...for curiosity's sake.Now, the reason I dropped a star is because it comes with no mounting hardware, which is really stupid. For $120 you figure they could throw an assortment of different length 3/8"" (#10) bolts, nuts, washers, and split/lock washers in with it. You can buy all the hardware on Amazon but it can get pretty expensive buying in bulk, especially if you're on salt water (which I'm not, so cheap zinc plated would have been fine.) You're better off going to the local hardware store (which is an hour away for me...grr) and just buying four of each for a couple bucks...or a little more for you salty dogs. It also doesn't come with a mounting template, but you can make your own pretty easy. Just so you know, the depth of the mounting holes are 3/8"", so add that into the calculations of the length bolts you need. You're also supposed to mount the charger vertically (on a wall) with 4"" of top clearance and 6"" of bottom clearance. Hope that helps."
368591,0,"I purchased a Marmot rain jacket years ago and loved it but when I recently caught it on something and tore a small hole in it, I decided to treat myself to a new one. I was a bit disappointed with the material...it seems much stiffer and ""crackly"" noise wise than my original and, therefore, doesn't wear as easily. I feel like I'm always straightening it out especially when I first put it on. I'm hoping with more wear it will soften."

Also, while this picture is exactly like the first black ones I bought, it does not match the current run of the ""Walking"" model. The black ones with the white threads through the soles seam to be a slightly better version of this model, and I wish I could find it again! But, the all-black version is good, too. I wear them as dress socks and everyday socks, both work and play. They are so good, that I just purchased the cream colored ones to go with my sneakers. I searched for many years before I settled on this brand!"

My issue is that I saw the same product for $4.00 less advertised honestly as a grabber all weather blanket and it too was an Amazon prime eligible item.So.. while I guess I am not knocking the product, I can't help but feel I was cheated out of some money on this one."

304958,2,"I bought this product so I can walk around with my wallet, keys, MP3 player and a 2 pint water bottle, doggie treats, cell and a doggy bag for when I went on my daily walks. I really just wanted a small bag to have around my waist with a water carrier, especially that it get so hot around in Texas.When product first arrived I noticed how thin and cheap the material was and that it had no padding, but then again I did buy this for a cheap price.Then I noticed that the pockets were very small and shallow and a normal sized wallet would not fit at all. You would have to remove your cash and cards in order for it to fit in one of the pockets, which is not very convenient for me. My small cell phone did fit inside one of the pockets with my small house keys. My ipod didn't fit in either of the pockets, although I do have an ipod classic and it is a bulky thing. I used a clip to attach the ipod on the belt strap of the carrier and that problem was solved. There was hardly any room to put anything else inside the small pockets and you have to choose whether or not to bring a plastic bag or doggie treats for your walks. Both would not fit in the pocket.The place you put in the water bottle in was very nice. It kept the water in place and hardly made any swishing noise when you walk. The elastic loop also helped keep the bottle in place and prevented it from falling.I was alright with the bag until one of the zippers broke off when I gently closed it after putting my keys in my pocket. The other pocket was also acting weird with the zipper and seemed about ready to fall off. I decided that I would just give the bag back since I wasn't 100 percent happy with it and I couldn't carry all that I needed in a convenient little bag.If only the bag's pockets were a little bigger and deeper and if the material had a bit of padding then this might have been the walking water carrier for me."
4773,0,"This knife is just the right size...not too big or small. And it's 'full tang' even has a reinforcement at the junction of the handle. The smooth wooden handle is not ideal for a great grip, but it looks very attractive. But with the way they designed the handle, it makes the blade appear longer than it really is...in case you plan on using it for defensive purposes. It's not made of carbon steel, and I don't even see any designation of ""440 stainless"", or anything similar. So, I would be hesitant at depending on this knife for 'heavy duty' tasks."
358602,2,"I gave the benefit of the doubt and thought perhaps, with a number of positive reviews, that the poor quality Schwinn was a thing of childhood jokes. I went ahead and purchased this in October of 2007. I am fairly active in other respects, so perhaps used my Schwinn an average of 2 times per week over the 2 year period (which works out to approximately 200 times). The bike was fairly decent to begin with. After about a year there was a discernible noise as my right foot pushed forward, but that was nothing a little more volume on the TV couldn't fix. Then tonight, to my dismay, my left pedal snapped right off where it connects to the 'wheel' section. I give it 2 stars generously. But this machine certainly didn't help quash my previously held notion about Schwinn quality."

I dried the he** out of it and now it appears to be better-sized for my spouse. I wish they'd get the sizing consistent but I assume that's probably a product of being made in multiple overseas locations where the guidelines vary..."

5539,1,"I've been pretty pleased with this stepper. As others have said, it does develop a moderately disruptive squeak, although I have not yet tried the WD-40 solution mentioned by another reviewer. This is the first non-huge stepper I've ever used, and I've been happy with it. Despite the seemingly small maximum step size, it's easy to regulate your step height by moving your feet closer or further from the back of the step platforms.If your exercise routine demands a constant supply of really big steps, this may not be the stepper for you. If you're looking for a workout that will get you out of breath but won't give you humongous calves, this is a good bet with a nice price."

360414,2,"One very important warning: This bed can ONLY be inflated after the pump has been plugged into a wall outlet and fully charged OR immediately if the pump is plugged into a car cigarette lighter with the provided adapter. It CAN NOT be inflated immediately when plugged into a wall outlet. The normal charge time is 12 hrs, but the initial charge time is 24 hrs. Thus, if you want to use it in your home, you MUST either still inflate it using a car cigarette lighter or wait 12-24 hrs before inflating it.I've never before seen any chargable appliance that won't work immediately when plugged into a wall outlet. I have no idea why it will work immediately plugged into a car but not plugged into a wall outlet. Seems like a limitation of the wall AC adapter."

287823,0,"First the good. This is definitely a solid lock, and I like that the metal is covered by a rubber coating to protect bike finish. I also like that they give you 5 keys, one of which has an LED in it. It is also long enough to fit on most bike racks, but would be nicer if it was a bit wider.And the bad. My biggest problem is with the lock/unlock mechanism. First, the metal U must be pushed into the base *just so* in order to be able to lock it. It usually takes me a few seconds to get it right. Also, you can not pull the key out of the lock when the key is turned to unlock - you much turn the key back to lock before pulling it out. The mount attaches to the bike via a strap with a one-way ratchet. I could not use this because the lock was too big to fit anywhere on my bike (it is a smaller frame though, 17"")Bottom line: I could overlook all the other shortcomings if the locking mechanism just worked better. But it doesn't. If you can get it cheap and don't mind the hassle, then maybe it'd be worth it."
383154,2,"I used this bike about 8 times and worked Ok. Now the bike's tension settings do not work above 3 and the wheel binds. I now have to take it apart and try to repair it. With these cheap components, this bike may work properly for light/small people under 120lbs. Somehow that is not stated in the MFR's product description? Not worth the $102 I paid for it or the hastle to return it to amazon.Update @ 2 months. After numerous cable tension ajustments to keep this thing working, the chinese manufacturing of the wheel is warped making this bike useless. it will now be going into the garbage. I will be purchasing a real exercise bike at my local sports dealer. You get what you pay for. Can I give this piece of junk zero stars?"
121528,2,"The reason I rated these product that way was because at first, when I bought it, it was seemed to be a googd gun that has a rapid fire in the Automatic mode, had a good range, and it had a strong damage for it to be a cheap gun. Once, I was shooting in automatic normally(this happened 3 weeks after I bought the gun).Later, when I was running out of ammo, I don't know how, the trigger of the gun went out flying but that wasn't the problem because if it would, I would just need to open the gun and put the trigger in it's place. THE REAL PROBLEM WAS THAT ONE STRANGE PIECE OF THE GUN GOT DAMAGED AND I COULN'T FIND THE PIECE ANYWHERE IN THE INTERNET SO, AT LAST, I SOLD THE GUN IN EBAY."
434019,0,"We got this tent as a gift from my husbands parents. We were so excited to use it! My husband put it up in the living room for the first time and it was simple!...We thought it would be the same, at the beach, but it wasn't. Of course our first day to the beach with our daughter was windy, but we didn't think it would pose that big of a challenge. However, it did. It took my husband about 20-25 minutes to get it set up. Even when it was up, staked down, and bagged down with sand, it kept blowing away (mind you it wasn't THAT windy!). We had to put our cooler, beach chair and bag in it just to get it to stand up without blowing away.Overall the tent is GREAT, if not using it on a windy day. It has wonderful ventilation with the windows so you never get hot if sitting inside. And the size is great for 2 adults or a bunch of kids!"
419938,0,"1. the ""Oxford"" shorts are shown as a dark maroon kind of colour, which is what I wanted, but NO! I received them in a heather grey colour, even though the packaging still says ""Oxford"". So BEWARE! I don't know if it is a photo error or a packaging error; either way, not worth the postage to return it2. they are small but NOT THAT SMALL! I read the reviews extensively before finally buying them. Previously, someone reviewed saying that she's an S-M and a XL would fit perfectly - which is what I bought. But both pairs arrived amazingly big. I think my boyfriend can wear them! I folded the waistband (note: elastic band, not strings) down twice and the shorts are still too long and too baggy and make my butt look 50% bigger. I'm a size 4 or 6 (ie S or M), and if I were to buy again, I would get size M, or at most L. So be careful when you up the sizes!Unfortunately these were not a good buy for me. I gave it 3 stars, however, because I think if you were lucky enough to get the right size and colour, they would be pretty good and they seem very comfortable."
253345,2,"I couldn't get the hang of using this sitting down, so now I use it exclusively as an arm exerciser. I don't do that very often either, though, because the right petal unscrews itself with each rotation. I chose this one for it's low, wide stance. I would not buy if I could go back."

56600,0,"The knife is about the perfect size to carry. Opening the knife is easy but disengaging the lock, (which is also part of the handle) is a little tougher than most. The Solstice is a great idea but very difficult to attach to a key ring. You have to squeeze the scissors together with one hand and turn the handles up with the other. Sounds easy enough, but the key ring tends to fall out of the hole/gaps during the process. Also the Solstice I got is pretty tight and the handles don't move as easily as I expected. Description says made in U.S.A. but package says made in China. I bought mine at a Target store vs from website don't know if that matters where they're made. I like my Leatherman Squirt(w/ scissors) a lot better than the Solstice and they are about the same size. Price is still good for quality Gerber products. I just wish it was made in U.S.A."
113321,1,"arrived quickly, belt was the perfect size. Quality is good. Looks like it will last many years of training. Thanks!"
488554,2,"UPDATE 30 Sep 12: This is the most inaccurate projectile device I have ever seen in my life. With the ""high quality"" BBs, it is all over the place. With the cheap ones it came with there is no safe place within 50 feet. I have made devices out of Lego that shoot straighter. I think I could spit BBs more accurately. ""Hop-up"" has no effect whatsoever. If you shoot full-auto, then probably 6 BBs out of an entire clip of ~45 will go where you want. Semi-auto (how I had planned to use it) is pointless.This is my first foray into Airsoft. I wanted something I can shoot at nuisance animals to make them unhappy in my yard without doing any permanent damage. I was in the military and was very comfortable with the M-16 so I got one that is basically shaped the same.The packaging is of surprisingly high quality. The shaped styrofoam is so solid and form-fitting it is actually difficult to get most of the items out of it. Hang on to the lid as you will want the pictures to help you figure out how things fit together.The feel of the basic gun is amazing. It is the same size as the real M-4 (the modern collapsing stock version of the M-16) and feels almost as solid. The safety, sights and magazine are all in the same place and have a remarkably authentic feel, although the hinge of the saftey selector does not go all the way through the receiver like on the real one and it would have been an easy capability to add. I occasionally teach people firearms safety and marksmanship and believe I will now use this as an intoductory training tool before switching to a real AR-15 (the semi-auto civilian version of the M-16).There is a grip safety on the front of the handgrip that you have to actuate before the trigger will function. It is fairly easy to integrate this extra safety switch with your normal hold so it is not a big annoyance, although I am not a fan because if a real rifle doesnt have it I dont see why a BB gun needs one.This gun has a lot of accessories. Unfortunately the instructions are in Engrish (not a typo) so you are on your own in figuring how to get them installed and working.It comes with: a carrying strap which other reviewers have panned thoroughly so I have no intention of relying on it, a magazine loading tube, a pair of safety goggles so you dont put your eye out like the Ralphie in ""a Christmas Story"" although they are non-linear (ie looking through them is like looking through prescription lenses - but SOMEONE ELSE's prescription), a laser targetter which I have no clue how to activate, a flashlight which I may or may not add since I dont anticipate shooting in the dark and a pseudo-red-dot sight which I also have no intention of using because I prefer ""open"" sights for their ease of tracking a moving target. It also comes with an additional handle to use it more like a machine pistol that I will also probably forgo the benefit of. It has a speed loader for the magazine that I assume holds a clip's worth of BBs, but once again in the absence of meaningful instructions one is on one's own as to how to use it. Naturally it comes with a recharger for the main battery and small batteries for the accessories.The main battery is in the handgrip area. To recharge the main battery you have to take apart the handgrip which is rather fussy, I would rather field-strip an M-16 completely than try to get at this battery. If I wind up using this a lot I will solder in a charging jack of some kind so it can be recharged without having to be dismantled. On the other hand its a $40 toy and cheap M-16s go for $700-ish, so...It comes with a small pack of .12g BBs that will refill the magazine 3 or 4 times so buy some more when you buy the gun. These come out of the gun at such a high velocity I cant really see them - I wish I had access to a chronograph. I bought a big jar of .20g BBs and they are much more ""deliberate"" coming out and are apparently slightly larger in diameter as they have a distinct resistance when inserting into the magazine which the originals did not exhibit. I would probably also buy another magazine, perhaps a higher capacity or easier to load or both, but I have not yet done so so I cant recommend one.I have only fired a couple of magazines thru it. Once you have started firing, several BBs are rather loose in the space between the receiver and the magazine so if you remove the magazine you will lose some BBs. It seems to pull left. As I get more used to it I may post an update. If it fails in the first year I will definitely post an update."

I had concerns about bad odors given off by the rubber cover on medicine balls, since I had read reviews of similar balls from other vendors. But this ball by Aeromats has no bad odors. It is also well made, with ergonomic handles that make it safer to handle while working out."
423917,1,"I bought 2 of these boats for my kids (3 and 6) to take to the lake. They were a hit!!! The pump was a little slow for impatient young ones, but other than that they were fantastic. They fit 2 people - 10 and under, or 1 adult. I know this because I spent the morning laying in one and had a great time! I loved the fact that the oars couldn't slip out and get lost. The rope at the front made it super easy to pull onto the beach, or tie to the back of the boat. One piece of advice: DON'T pull these behind a motorized boat... the eye for the rope pulled right out, leaving a huge hole, a flat boat and a completely devastated child :( I will be buying 4 or 5 more since all the kids, and adults at the lake LOVED them!!!"
89972,2,"Oftentimes I wonder if these positive comments are left by the individual seller. This seller I'm sure is fantastic no doubt, but sadly I feel it'd be injustice to allow prospective buyers to invest in a product horribly made. The bolt handle (The piece you pull back) snaps easily especially if the bolt is disproportionately made. I've heard there is a 75% rate of imperfections meaning something will be off for example your hop-up (the utility that allows your bb's to fly straight). If this is for your young teen in their enclosed backyard shooting at tin cans, I would say this is a fine gun due to it's great price. If this is for a more serious and/or prolonged user, please invest in more name-brand versions. Thank you, I hope I did not offend anyone or their opinions."
294221,0,My eTrex includes a mirco sd card. The card slot prevents this battery cover from fitting. At $15 I just grinded the cover to make it fit. Not what I would suggest for others. For the right version of eTrex this would be a good product.

497175,1,"I have used this polish on my jewelry, hugh brass wall plates and smaller brass bowls. Silver service set. It is great for detailing cars, of course, but my friend used it on a pair of my gold earrings I was wearing, and you would not believe how black her rag was. It was a real eye opener. I have happily been cleaning my jewelry with Simichrome Polish ever since. I just used it on one of my kitchen knives that turns black. Then I oil the knife and wipe off excess oil and it is good to cut bread for another year. I use it on my silverware. I had rust spots on my new stainless silverware and the Simichrome polish removed the spots. I trust this product not to scratch and to get even fine jewelry clean."

314547,0,when this first arrives it is to stiff to move in but after washing it a few times it gets better and it dose not hold up verry well but for the price it was worth it.

154,1,"This is my first hitch mounted bike rack and it was very easy to assemble. I had one issue with interference with my factory mounted trailer plug but this was GMC's design flaw. The rack is well made, very stable and works well. Bikes load up easily and the rack is flexible enough to take a variety of bike designs and sizes. Bikes remain secure when installed and are a snap to remove with the rack folding up and out of the way when empty. Overall, I would highly recommend this product."
113450,1,"My wife blew apart her shifter after 3000km, this shifter was cheap and better quality than the one the bike came with. Was very pleased to install it, the instructions were clear and was a very easy install."
283028,1,It's very reliable. I have used it everyday for about a year now and haven't had ANY problem with it. It's very well worth it.

323153,0,"Fast service and the product does match to its website description. It will be nice to ship it in a box instead of a soft envelop, so the shipping will not damage to the product original box. I am okay since this is not going to be a gift for others."

333618,1,"I have not played the 06 or 07 versions, but I am pleased with Madden 08 on the PSP. The animation is good, the controls are intuitive and responsive, and the amount of extras is welcome. Load times are not bad either.My only complaint is that I find it very difficult to run the ball at the higher difficulty levels. A 14-10 game that ends with 200 passing yards and 10 rushing yards for both teams is not very realistic. If you play on the easier levels the stats even out but you'll easily spank the CPU opponent. I'm hoping that I just need more time with the game to run the ball more effectively.Overall, if you want to play football on the go, I recommend this game."

I am 6 ft.3 and have none of the arm or leg issues some other reviewers seem to have. The only problem I see is that at 18 mos. and far less than 40 lbs. she will easily outgrow the seat before she is 3. Also, I had to remove the rear deflector under my seat of my Trek hybrid in order to mount the bracket."
418139,2,"I should have paid attention to previous reviews. You can call it fraud to list this product as Ping-pong balls.

437221,0,"These gloves are comfortable and have alot of padding. The wrist-strap is thick and provides adequate support to the wrist. The only thing is that according to the sizing on Amazon I purchased a Medium but the gloves fit me kind of loose. This could be because they are not designed correctly or because the size might be big. I'm not sure. I like my gloves to fit snug so that I can do pull-ups withouth the burn on my hands from the pressure of my bodyweight. At the moment, I'm not sure if I should return these and get a size Small or if I should get another pair of Bionic. Besides that, the gloves look good, protect my hands and wrist but the fit is not the best."

315634,1,"My kid is going on his 6th year of taekwondo and is 10 years old. Obviously he has grown a lot and unfortunately everytime we buy a new outfit, the pants never fit quite right. My kid is tall and thin so if the top fits, the pants end up being too long and baggy. We needed to buy just the pants. We had bought Tiger Claw outfits in the past and the quality was always good. I thought these pants were going to be the same as the ones that came with the full outfits (top and bottom) - but apparently not. It does look less well constructed but given my kid is still growing (fast), these will do for now."
262553,2,"I use this now and then, but the laser stopped working on me for osme odd reason, I changed the batteries and it didnt light back up, and it was the correct size and fresh out of the pack. So i dont reccomend this product because it has the tendency to work now and then"
467395,0,"The Montague soft carrying case does everything it is supposed to do. I have the Paratrooper Pro, and it fits right in, with the extra separate slot for the front wheel. I've used it maybe five times and it works well for toting the bike around, into restaurants etc. However, on the last big trip I took with the Montague, folded and packed, on Amtrak, I did not use this soft carrying case. Instead I used a carrying case for a massage table. It is of equivilent size, has the straps etc., and is made of a thicker more robust material. Also the Montague bag has the SwissBike emblem emblazoned on one side, where the table bag did not, so I considered it less likely to be an advertisement to a thief. And a massage table bag is $60 to $90.The Montague bag is fine, just maybe consider that there are other options."

33002,1,"I thoroughly enjoy these pants. I've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities. These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I've been through - including 5.11, Woolrich, etc. I think the best feature on these pants - which isn't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side (for me, the strong side). This pocket, placed directly behind the front pocket (and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer's) has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached. The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size, such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis. My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over. These are great."
4208,2,"I wanted to like these pants so bad. I'm 5'8'' 135 Lbs and they were too short for me. I guess I'm a little anal when it comes to my pants being long enough, but regardless, they were way too thin. I have a pair of Adidas and prefer their dry-fit fabric over these. These are for sure a summer pant."

They take some minor fussing about to get into, but just about as much hassle as putting on shoes. The former gymnast/ballet-dancer of the house finds them to be perfect, but I have the legs and calves of a retired downhill ski racer (The life histories will tell you why we both needed the Teeter-hangup in the first place). I only get one or two ""clicks"" into the tightening strap around my tree-stump legs, but it's the same quality system that is used in ski boots- so I have no actual concerns. Can't do without them. Highly recommended."

I did order them in the ""Pink Elevation Print with Pink Iridium Lens"" that I was unaware was going to be as girlie as they are...

The interior space was much smaller than expected due to the retractable wheels and backpack straps taking up several inches of space. It also lacks organizer pockets. It would have been nice to have some mesh pockets on the inside as well as one pocket on the outside for quick access to travel documents or a light jacket. It's also pretty heavy. I do like the water bottle pocket on the side of the suitcase (would've been nice if the backpack had one too). The backpack is on the small side but not bad. One nice thing is that the backpack straps are adjustable (can raise higher or lower). Overall, it wasn't what I was looking for, so I'm returning it. Super fast shipping and free returns is a plus though."
297336,0,"First, I'll assume you've read Charlie's review. Everything he states is spot on. The bag is durable, he describes the layout well, and I agree exactly with his pros and cons. I'm currently a junior in high school, and my work load is huge. This bag carries 4 binders, 2 textbooks, graphing calculator, notebooks, pencils/pens, and a novel. It all fits easily and there's no strain on the bag or strap. In fact, the simple canvas strap is surprisingly comfortable. It doesn't slip or dig into my shoulder.However, I have to agree with Daniel in regards to the zipper. I avoid using it to expand the bag unless I really have to, all because it's so flimsy. Unzipping it is fine, but when it comes time to close it up, I cringe at every snag because it feels like it's going to break. So far it hasn't, but it's gotten caught so many times. I do have one more gripe about this bag. There were many, many long threads hanging off the bag. The stitching itself is very durable, but I suppose production couldn't be bothered to snip off the ends. All in all, it took me nearly half an hour to trim up the threads.Pros:- Versatile- Durable canvas and workmanship- Wide, comfortable strap- Great design (again, read Charlie's review)- Handles a heavy loadCons:- Cheap plastic zipper- Threads hanging off are time-consuming (if you're bothered by them)I am very pleased with this purchase. It's a great value for a good bag.**EDIT:I have now had this bag for 3 months. At this point, the flimsy plastic zipper slider has now completely broken. The rest of the bag is fine, but I barely use it anymore because the bag is stuck expanded. If it isn't stuffed full, it becomes very floppy and annoying. This renders it useless to me since I don't use it on a daily basis. I am changing my review from 5 to 3 stars."
105604,0,"Great coat for the price. However, zipper did mess up first time worn and jacket runs short. Ordered XL for my son who is between a L and XL. Jacket barely hits the top of his pants when he's standing, not a good coat when he sits or bends over. Otherwise, good coat for price."
250761,0,"It's quite good as a light, but the bracket broke after 4 months and it's gone. Before that, I found that the quick remove mechanism would also release with some bumps. Maybe it's because I can't attach it to the seat column, as it expects, but just sort of cable tied it.My solution to the quick release had worked (a cable tie around the release) but just the other day I found only the column mount left. All the mounting parts are plastic and somewhat cheap.But the light is rather good, bright, and has flashing patterns. Although the quick on/off flashing does seem to annoy drivers in cars who sometimes shouted at me.But I am willing to try again and buy another one."
89646,0,"I recently purchased this expecting to use it in my powertec rack. Not possible. Its built ok, not brilliant. I was getting up off the floor and put my hand on the front left of the seat, and it felt like if I did that again it would break (I am only 150lbs). My main gripe is that I cannot use it in my rack. Maybe I misordered/misunderstood what it was for. Now I need to work out how to get rid of it so I can buy another bench...(chicago)."
431252,0,The company shipped this in its original box. So when it came the box was beat up and one of the doors was broken. Now I have to deal with exchanging it. The box should halve been placed inside another box for protection. There are also not enough instructions on how to hang it or attach the dart board to the case. It was also missing screws.
62889,2,"Ordered this product for off-duty carry of my cuffs and spare mag. I liked the paddle option as my current case requires a take my belt off to disarm. However, when I received the case, I realized just how overly massive this it is. There's at least a quarter inch, probably closer to three-eights between the paddle and case itself (I know my pants aren't that thick), plus no curvature at all to keep it close to my hip. Secondly, I ordered a size 4 for my HK USP magazines, and there is an excessive amount of play in the mag pouch, so much that if you're running, your mag is gonna come out. The cuff pouch is also larger than needs to be, does not fit S&W; 100 cuffs securely, but gives them plenty of room to make some noise.I give it two stars for quality leather, but it's not gonna work for my needs."
153634,2,"These shorts start off with their advertising all over the waist band, which is not in the advertised picture - not appreciated. Then they are very difficult to put on, compared with the slightly more expensive Asics. Then they have no crotch support, unlike Asics, and a similar observation to another bad review here. I thought this kind of item was pretty similar across the manufacturer board. Wrong. The same could be said for the sleeveless exercise shirts. Performance there varies tremendously - Champion, Reebok, Acics, etc. Only recommendation is try one, if good, get more, else try another brand. Personally I found Asics to be the best across the board for this kind of exercise wear."
2582,1,"I love these shirts, they keep me cool in the summer. I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good."
446664,0,I bought this 2 months ago and started using this immediately to help with my knee problems. My knee condition seems to have improved although I do not credit the improvements to this product alone. I used this in conjunction with other exercises and therefore do not know to what extent this has helped me. The product is good but not exceptional. Sometimes the velcro used to enclose the weight in the pockets comes loose and the individual 1/2 lbs weights falls out. Therefore caution should be exercised when using this with children and pets around especially when one is doing the leg lift exercise to help with lower back pain. They need to do something stronger to secure the weights.
22031,1,The jersey was received in just a few days and in perfect shape. The person who received it found the shirt to be a quality product.
5798,0,"Good basic jackets, with satisfactory fit for men and women. Slightly bulky at the front but still comfortable. For a low priced item, it does the job!"
495196,0,I bought it as a gift and it was well received. Don't have much to say either way.
457420,0,"This watch has been beloved to me for all of its features and functions, which have worked well and as described in the manual. It has lasted me 1 & 1/2 to 2 (or going on 3? I've lost track) years, and I have not needed to replace batteries for that time.2 problems only have arisen during that time:-moisture leaked or seeped into the casing & resulted in a ""fog"" under the glass, on a few occasions*-the resin watch strap has broken up near where it attaches to & braces against the casing***the moisture could be partially due to my fault in pressing buttons not too long after having had the watch wet (but NOT submerged). I believe the manual says something about the watch not being water resistant when buttons are depressed, but again, I should think for a 100-meter water resistant watch, that unless submerged, my pressing buttons when the watch was just splashed with water on the outside shouldn't result in seepage. I consider this a design/manufacturing flaw.**I discovered part of the brace crumbling apart one day, and now my strap has permanently & completely broken & detached. However, I recalled later that I may have had it in a pocket and rolled/crunched over it, earlier that day or the previous morning.I would buy this watch again, so long as it was at a discount (it was clearance-priced, the first time I purchased at a retailer). I am trying to find a replacement strap but this watch's strap has a kind of unique design for attaching to the case, and this may make it replacement-prohibitive."
315159,0,"Fits perfectly in the corner of my office. I didn't get the stand but will be buying it really soon. It is too cumbersome adjusting and grabbing these from the floor. A little ackward to use initially but you will get used to it. The one thing I would complain about is I can't for the life of me comprehend why Bowflex decided the bar should be rectangular instead of round. I find a spend a lot of time adjusting the dunmbell so the flat textured side is against my palm. Also don't like the way the ends taper instead of maintaining a consistant size. I wouldn't give these a 10. They work ok for my purposes and my selection of these is a statement of the limited products out there that have this great a range of weight selections. For the money I think more thought should have gone into the design of these. This design fits the dumbells that go up to 50lbs, but the heavier lifters that would but the 1090s I think have different wants."
45352,0,The size is accurate. I'm more used to the neck hole being wider than this and also the hand openings are a little tight. Other than that it fits fine.
36963,1,"I would just like to say THANKYOU to Columbia for providing me with the men's ROC short that was worn, during the warm months, probably 3-5x per week for FOUR years. This is no lie. Great for hiking, fishing, casual wear, or really anything. The zip-up security pocket was discrete and useful, and the SAGE color was very stylish. They only began to look better with age and wear, and I literally wore them until the pockets gave out and the butt started to rip. Even after they began to rip, I still wore them until the seams at the bottom of the short began to rip out, and then I just looked like a bum so I had to throw them away. I was legitimately sad the day that I could not wear them anymore.These shorts are rugged and will last you years of wear! I will now order two or three pairs so I can rotate, and they will probably last me for a lifetime."
93666,2,"If you are taller than 5-foot-2, this sit-up board is not for you. If it doesn't break your legs, it'll shut off circulation to them and to your feet, and you'll hang over the end. When I tried it, I couldn't pay much attention to my abs because my lower legs were in such misery. On the plus side, it would be ideal for waterboarding midgets."
433798,2,I read other reviews warning that this was a bear to put together. So I had it shipped directly to my brothers home for a Christmas gift for our nieces and nephews. Having my brother deal with putting it together was my best move of 2008. There was a wrong piece shipped that added to the diffcult assembly. Drove my brother mad but at least I came out looking good with the kids.
61390,1,"I'm not a big fan of drinking water. A bottle of water would last me for days! I was tired of spending money on bottled water and decided to purchase the BPA-Better water bottle in hopes that I would drink more water. And I do!! I bought the 24oz size and drink one of those a day. That is alot for me. With the bite valve I drink so much more than I would with the typical water bottle. You can knock it over and it doesn't spill, easy to clean. I highly recommend the CamelBak BPA-Free Beter Water Bottle with Bite Valve."
40750,0,"Shipping took about 2 weeks and I paid for expedited shipping. That was disappointing but the shorts are nice. Simple and not too long like most athletic shorts these days. I'm 5'10"" and they extend to just above my knees."
395596,1,"My friend and I both use these for triathlon training. They are a little weird to put in your ears and can create some pressure. Usually I have to release the pressure when I put them in. If you put them in right they will keep the water out (I always hated having water in my ears after a swim!). My friend has absolutely no problems with them. My ears are a little more sensitive but they are affordable and do the job! I dropped them on the sand, it is like a piece of gum, sand granules will get stuck to it which is not surprising given the malleable material but it is just irritating. Overall I love them and will continue to use them."
346181,2,"This was one of our worst purchases. Rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better! The snorkle and mask were constant problems, leaking, filling with water, etc. We had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up."

486217,2,"In short: went to wrong house and left there- took 4 weeks to arrive, well, 3 weeks(it was at my neighbors for 1 week. Had to buy 2 intertubes because manufacturers deffect. Haven't been on the road yet...we'll see. It's a pretty bike besides all that. Hope it rides just as well."
387117,2,I was doing squats during my cardio exercise and the seam at the butt ripped open! The top is great..but the pants are subject to rip. Good luck!
48851,1,"Mountain Hardware hits a home run for backpackers with these durable, convertible pants. I carry a heavy pack, and the lightweight nylon strap belt is unnoticeable beneath the pack's waist belt. The features are well thought out: there's an internal zip pocket inside the right front pocket, so you won't lose your wallet or other small valuables. The left front pocket has a hook to keep your car keys from getting lost. The rear pockets are deep but loose, so items in those can potentially fall out. The ankles have snaps--you can easily slide the lower pant leg off over a large boot when you want to convert to shorts. The material is extremely durable and mosquitoes can't seem to bite through them, but they are easily burned: I have a small hole in my pair from a stray ember. Even though the material is tough, the pants are also light weight and comfortable in almost any weather. My only real complaint is that they do shrink--mine did by quite a bit. Without that, I would give these pants a straight five stars. But the design is still better than anything else on the market. Other makers could learn a lot by studying these."
442735,1,Don't know what the fuss about the negative 1 star reviews is about. Some people can never be happy.It was easy to use and amazing product. This is a no brainer and a must have for any serious body builder or strength athlete.

220236,2,"I bought this percolator to replace an aluminum WWII era percolator, that still works excellent, because I wanted to move away from cooking with aluminum. The actual weight of the pot and lid is nice, however, the interior parts are quite flimsy. I even had to bend a piece back into shape before I could use the pot for the first time. The stainless basket is nice but the lid to the basket doesn't fit tight in the basket and you end up with a lot of grinds in the coffee. On my old aluminum percolator the basket lid actually snaps tight into the basket. This is a typical Corporate American profit squeezing product. I don't expect it to last very long at all and will get used to flossing the grinds out of my teeth."
39250,0,"I've been keeping my eyes on this product for the last few years thinking it would be the perfect solution for me in my cramped workout area in my home. Finally this Christmas I bought them. Here's what I found:Pluses:- Eliminates the need to have many dumbbells.- The stand was free on a promotion.- The handle is fairly comfortable.- Nice variety of weights to choose from.Minuses:- Bulky for a dumbbell.- The weights shift as you are lifting them, making balance an issue.- Have to adjust not one, but two dials to dial in the correct weight for each dumbbell and you dial them in opposite directions.- The weights feel like they are about to come off. They didn't for me, but they just didn't feel solid.Conclusion:Bottom line on this one is try them before you buy them. They may be great for you, but for me they are awkward and that's why I returned them. I tried out a pair of PowerBlocks the other day and am going to go that route. They are more solid, easier to change weights, and smaller. Plus, the 5-45lb set is way cheaper than the SelectTech's at around $267 with free shipping."
367470,1,"The ball was a pain to blow up, but now that it is, I love it! It is great for these excersises but also great for just stretching out your back after a long day. We even keep it in the living room and use it as an extra chair- it burns more calories sitting on that then on the couch! The video is just a preview of the rest of the series, but, I think that as a beginners workout intro to the balance ball idea, it is good and certainly serves its purpose. It gives you a chance to get your balance and get strong enough to move on the the other videos!"
469805,1,"I just got these sog knives a few days ago, and i have been throwing them since. The coating they put on it helps so much from scraches and dings. They came out of the packige sharp like a razor.The shipping was amazing, after I orderd them I got them in a three days time. Twice as fast as they said. The wieght is perfect, you really dont need to throw them that had to make them fly and stick on contact. I did not have one problem with these knives and the next time I buy more I deffently buying from SOG. my past knives I have orderd do not compare to these, they are a must have!!!"
341180,0,"An okay - not great, not good - tent. I bought it under a time constraint of discovering my old tent - a Eureka, and by far superior - had broken. Needing something quickly, and taking with the grain of salt I would only use the thing a few times, I took the shoestring budget approach.The set-up is shoddy and the instructions are vague. It repels water very poorly and the poles are easily breakable. Granted, a tent is what it is: a temporary, outdoor, small domicile. You'd think they'd make a product more durable to fit that definition.The tent served its purpose as a quick fix solution and the price was right at $20. In retrospect (and without a time constraint), I'd easy spend 2 or 3 times that much for a quality tent - Coleman, Eureka, good names that deliver. Unless you need a quick fix like I did, spend money on something that will last for you."
162608,0,"This monitor gives consistent reading of heart rate during workout. When a workout is finished the monitor can provide you with your maximum heart rate during the session, as well as your average heart rate during exercise, and the total time of exercise. Its functionality as a monitor is excellent.The reason for the less than five star rating is the unfortunately poor design and planning for battery replacement in the monitor. The chest strap battery is easy to change, just insert a coin, twist to remove the battery compartment cover, install a new battery and replace the cover. Unfortunately, the battery in the wrist monitor is not so easy to change. It requires releasing a watch strap pin where the watch strap connects to the monitor, to allow the watch's back to then be opened next. Four small screws must then be removed from the back so it can be taken off. Then an even smaller screw, it is quite small, must be removed from the battery cover so a new battery can be reinserted. This process must be reversed to close the watch monitor. This is quite a tedious process requiring jewelers screwdrivers to work with the monitor's small screws. This process clearly presents some significant problems for the end user. In fact, the manual states in capital letters, ""TIMEX STRONGLY RECOMMENDS TAKING YOUR MONITOR TO A LOCAL RETAILER OR JEWELER TO HAVE THE BATTERY REPLACED"".The batteries have proven to be quite long-lived, so perhaps some of the five star reviews may have been made before the batteries needed changing. For a relatively inexpensive monitor to require visiting a retailer or jeweler to replace a battery or risk damaging the monitor is simply poor design.The bottom line: five stars for information display and functionality, two stars for monitor battery replacement design."

59697,2,"You will NOT get what you order!!Same as the last reviewer, I ordered this CLEAR HIGH-BACK STAND shown in the photo from Wowzzer, and instead got a SMALL BLACK STAND with a long solid front face, the BCW-Pro-Mold-Sports-Stand-Display.

81372,1,"The only thing I don't like about the rod is it doesn't fit in my Berkley Spiral Rod Holder. It is very easy to see at night, has plenty of backbone, and the LEDs' are a bonus. It's a real nice rod overall."

388130,0,"My son loves it and it's very tacky, almost too tacky. I'm sure the finish will wear over time and the surface will become less gluey to the touch. It's not bad, but on a humid day, it feels really sticky and did throw off a few passes. But overall, it came inflated and in perfect condition, so it's a good ball.UPDATE: after just a month or so, the finish on the ball is wearing away. It's still tacky and inflated, but where our thumb touches the ball to throw is worn away! It's a much lighter shade of color than the rest of the ball and is smoother. Still a nice ball, but just not as durable as I'd like."

466429,1,"I love Hogue grips. I have two for my pistols and two for my rifles. This one is designed for an AR rifle. I put mine on a SCAR16s rifle which allegedly has an AR grip interface. It does not fit exactly, and there is a noticeable 1/8 inch gap between the top of the grip and the rifle. Published solutions include milling down the rifle interface and milling the grip. I chose to put some hot glue between the grip gap and the rifle and made sure it was compressed a little to add structural rigidity. A little ugly, but functional. And hey, I'm an engineer. It's all about function. If I were buying today I'd look for something that was guaranteed to fit on my SCAR16s properly. But if you're buying for an AR platform I wager this would be a sweet grip. I like mine. I guess I can't knock the fit since I'm not mounting to an AR, so I give this 5 stars. Make sure you have a long wrench or socket to get to the screw."
332375,1,"What you should know: ""700C, ERD 602.9mm, ETRTO 622X16mm"" is Alex's accurate description. The outside rim width is 21.7mm.My bike is a road bike, and the outside width of the stock rims (Alex R500) is 18 or 19mm, so the brakes had to be opened up a little bit.Because this rim is slightly wider than some road rims, it should be able to take tires to 32mm, possibly even 35mm. The wheel isn't precisely true in every tiny detail, but it is pretty good, especially for the price. I'm using it for my trainer. If I build up a frame, this wheel will probably go on it, but I would consider re-tensioning and re-truing the wheel because it just might help.Don't forget a rim strip for this."

140880,0,"I love this hopper for a few things:1: Very clear, easy to see the amount of ammo you have left.2: Electric, does make the paintballs shoot that little bit faster.3: Easy access on/off switch, easily visible.4: The flip top lid. It is decently hard to open it, and if you don't press down hard enough it will open, but if you lock it into place, it isn't coming open, no matter how hard you hit your gun. That alone outweighs any other problem with the led in my opinion.5: Still, better than any stock hopper out there.I hate this hopper for a few things:1: It doesn't fit quite right into my gun. The feedneck isn't round, but has a bunch of small grooves running vertically up the face, which makes it so that it has a loose fit in your gun. I guess you could duct tape it down to the gun, but that looks stupid/ghetto.2: Very noisy. I turn it on and it has a whining sound that annoys me like no other sound.3: Electric. Yes, I loved that part, but if you forget to turn it on, the paintballs don't shoot at all. It fires about 4 shots and then just jams.4: On/off switch. Again, I loved it, but it is easy to hit on accident, so if you are in the middle of a firefight and accidentally bump it you get screwed. Also, if it is in your bag or trunk or something, it can move around and turn on and run your battery down on the way to/from the field. So, bring an extra battery with you.5: Only holds 140 rounds instead of the standard 200, but that is easy to deal with with ammo tubes or just firing less.Anyways, I hope this helps."
57914,0,"The Petzl performs well and is very comfortable to wear. In fact, it's so light that you barely notice it's there. It's VERY bright and I like all of the adjustable light settings, the tilt feature, and the night vision feature. My biggest concern is that I've used the much, much cheaper Energizer headlamps and compared to the Petzl they feel rock solid. Once you feel the unit in your hands you'll know what I mean, it seriously feels like something you'd find at a dollar store. Personally, I wouldn't sacrifice durability just to save weight. As many others have noted, the battery compartment is also very flimsy, it (barely) snaps into place with a very thin piece of plastic and leaves me feeling that it could come open at any moment. I haven't used it in the rain but I wouldn't feel very confident in it's water resistance either as the unit doesn't seem very well sealed.I'm going to keep it but if I could go back I'd buy another Energizer headlamp for 1/2 the cost."
80956,1,easier to use than a foam roller. have had a foam roller for months and have used the stick way more in just a couple of weeks. it is easy to use and easy to target needed spots. you can use it sitting in a chair or standing. just ordered one for a friend!
289909,0,Good and bad for this jacket. First the price is to much. I paid $74.00 but it should have been lower because there is nothing to this jacket. It feels like your wearing a piece of plastic lined with netting. Yes it is waterproof but you better be wearing a flannel shirt underneath or you will freeze.The other good thing i can say about this jacket is the size was perfect. The sleeves are long enough for me as I am 5'8 and it is hard to find a jacket with sleeves long enough.

451281,2,The fit is very good but the glasses have a tendency to fall off your head with quick movement. The included head strap is very uncomfortable and leaves streaks on the glasses when wet.

469898,0,"so first off this gun is super heavy you get used to it fast but if you arnt willing to tote around 8 or 9 lbs dont buy it.. secondly it has a bit of a wobble between the front part of the gun and back part of the gun, its not the break down latch (east fix.. jam a guitar pick in there and snap it add alil glue to make sure the guitar pick doesn't fall out later) thirdly the barrel sucks defiantly get a tight bore (6.03) range is EPIC!! i have a 250 foot range with stock internals!! (hits a man size target 9\10 times)this gun is defiantly worth the money if you know what your doing it requires aot of upgrading (hpa rig, barrel, hop up, scope, and a few random mods expect to spend around $600 in upgrades ) overall its an ok gun (non upgraded.. but is FEEKIN EPIC if upgraded) but if your just starting off dont buy this gun just get a bar 10 or something.."

Yes, they may be nicer to hold onto than doing push-ups on the floor, but they are nothing special and have function. What you see is what you get.The plastic also feels a little cheap. I don't mean to exaggerate, but part of me was expecting the plastic to crack under my 150lb weight.If you are going to spend money on push-up handles, spend the extra few dollars on the nice ones that spin."

313186,0,"These absolutely met the need for which they were purchased...allowing low vision individuals to participate in our community Bingo games. We have a lot of the smaller slide window cards, and compared to those these were kind of cheap. First, the windows open/close from the top to bottom, and often stick. The window slide dot could be a little bigger and slightly more raised, since most low-vision clients are senior citizens. (Can we spell ARTHRITIS??) Similar standard sized Bingo cards open/close sideways, so these took some getting used to. Also, standard cards can be completely cleared by opening the ""free space"" window, while these do not. We have to take extra time between games for these cards to have each window individually opened.Overall, the residents who use these cards are pleased to be able to play Bingo wth the rest of the community. The overall size and print(font) are wonderful for visually impaired individuals. Despite the fact that these aren't the best quality, they're really all that's out there for low-vision. and I'd purchase more if needed..."

214763,1,"Here's the bottom line folks. This thing is the trick. If you are presently using one of the wrist strap type of releases, you're going to love this release. Especially if you are a hunter.With the wrist strap type and hunting; you sit on your stand, spot your target, take your eyes off of your target as you look down to attach your release to your bow. You look up; what happened to that critter? With this release, there is no more taking your eyes off of the target, fidgeting and moving around. This thing is small, it stays attached to your bow at all times. It is ready to rock and roll when you are. Even in target shooting. When you're done shooting and go to collect your arrows, attach it to your bow. No more release dangling from your wrist. And I've found that the wrist type of release is dependent on how tight you have it on your wrist. Varying tightness can cause variance in your shot. Not so with the Tru Ball T-Handle.It is also easily adjustable as to how easily it releases. This is not a back tension type of release. Just hold it in your usual release position and use thumb pressure. Amazingly simple and great product. Now if I could just get the store to take back our two newly purchased wrist releases."

269676,1,"I bought this bike right after I tore my ACL and was facing surgery the following week. I spoke to several physical therapist I worked with and they reccommended an upright bike for post ACL repair. I was not able to actually use it until 4 weeks post-op but when I did it really helped me get back my range of motion. It is a good solid magnetic resistance bike, you can also use low to no resistance like I did following my knee surgery. I have recently been able to increase the resistance and it really tones your legs and buns quickly, and you will burn calories and sweat when you do! I prefer this bike over the recumbent bikes because you get a better calorie burn, however if you have a back injury I would suggest the recumbent bike(my physical therapist explained that it takes the pressure off your spine). Overall I am very pleased with this bike. Mine is the Gold version and I paid $128 total."
219738,0,"This is not the kit as on other sites with included targets, sights, pellets etc. this is just the rifle with a single shot and 5 round clip. The rifle itself is a mixed review. The stock and feel of the rifle is nice. Accuracy hard to assess with standard sights. Ok for plinking only. No problem hitting a tin can at 20 yards, but not precise. The issues are the cocking arm is flimsy and binds on cocking. Effort might be too much for youngsters. The 5 round clip is soft rubber , it also binds and doesn't always index and pellets fall out and jam action. Also the bolt would not close once. The same rifle is available elsewhere as a kit. A plus is the quietness. It is the quietest air rifle I have out of several springers, a CO2, and another pump up. Also there is no recoil like a springer so it is good for practice shooting.Update, the company contacted me. The listing is not their error, they are aware of the problem."
335600,1,"First off let me tip my hat to Amazon for shipping this to me a day early, that was awesome. This product is the best upgrade to my shotgun I will ever do. I own an 870 express and before I put this stock on I could shoot maybe a dozen shots before I started to get sore. Any more than 20 and my shoulder would hurt for days (mostley 00 buck or slugs). After installing this stock I went through 30 rounds (mostley 2 3/4"" slugs) with no problem. I was able to aim down the sight fine and my accuracy was actually better than before. An older gentlemen at the range asked if he could try it and I let him. He was amazed at the lack of recoil an asked if he could shoot a slug through it, I told him he already did!I felt no ""cheek slap"" whatsoever. How you ask? Because I read the instructions on where to place you head. As long as you're at least 1"" away from the beginning of the buffer tube your fine.The only downside with this stock is it hurts your wrist to fire it from the hip. My brother has a pistol grip only shotgun and his was fine. It could be how all pistol grips with adjustable stocks feel or specific to this brand. No big deal as I never fire it from the hip anyway.Order this stock, you'll wanna go shooting all the time with it."

I cleaned them all in soapy water (all plastic parts) and reassembled the head. It seems OK now. I swear it is a leftover from the 70's when I had one on my little schwinn 20"". It is IDENTICAL to the one I had. Works well now, and cable is tough enough to stand up. My son had a digital one, but the front wheel spun around and snapped the tiny little wire, so we are giving this a shot as I dont want to spend 50+ on wireless versions."

487420,0,"I purchased this treadmill because it was reasonably priced and had the least amount of bells and whistles on it and wasn't a huge hulking monster - all I wanted was something easy and safe to walk on when the weather isn't cooperating. It does come mostly assembled, and the set up instructions are fairly easy to follow (though the instructions indicate that the safety pin is on the left, it's actually on the right - at least on mine it is. Several of the knobs were damaged and/or broken during shipment, and there are some scrapes and scratches in places. The monitor is easy to read, and they did at least think to put a holder for a water bottle or a TV remote on it as well. The handles are long, which seems safe. It doesn't make too much noise when you're on it, so if you were listening to music or watching TV or someone else is in the room, it doesn't cause too much of a disturbance.Though the picture and description indicate that there is no incline, there actually is when you set it up, and there's no way to adjust it. You'd probably have to put some books or a piece of wood or something underneath the back end to get a level walking surface, so this treadmill is probably not good for those just beginning an exercise routine because you're stuck with the incline.My biggest complaint is that the belt does not stay in the middle of the walking platform. It slides one way or the other. I've tried to adjust it, but it simply won't stay permanently in the middle. I worry that the edges will fray and stick, and I'll end up having to buy belts on a regular basis.It's okay for the price, but I'm not thrilled with it."

31461,2,"Nicely designed bag on the whole. See other reviews here for features and such. Big enough for riding local and handling the essentials.Would have been nice if it had a pocket inside that would fit a smart phone - my HTC is too tall to fit the mesh one on the rear flap which meant it got stuck in there with my garage door opener and folding tool set, bouncing along for the ride.Biggest negative is that the zipper for the rear flap only last 13 months - 2 zips per ride, 4 rides a week, or somewhere around 500 uses. First the zipper pull came off at 6mos then the rest of zipper body at the end. Not good.Bought a different brand as a replacement, hoping it will last longer."
439238,0,"I bought this basket because I have a Topeak Explorer Rack and wanted to use it for when I go shopping or need to carry more than usual on my commute to school. I needed a basket to use with my rack, and since this basket uses the MTX mounting system, it works perfectly with compatible Topeak racks.Pros:As a basket, the utility cannot be denied. Also, the basket is pretty sturdy. It's very easy to install and remove and there is a removable handle built into the basket.Cons:It's not really a one-size-fits all design and the handle is too whimpy for any significant weight. I have a 21 inch bike and the basket fits on with ease. My friend has a 14 inch bike and the top of the basket interferes with her seat. As for the handle, it begins to give under only the weight of my cable and u-lock. Another flaw is that the basket will not sit flat on the floor, since the rail mounting system sticks out. There are two little feet on the front of the basket, but that only stabilizes the front of the basket. There are no feet on the back so it has a tendancy to wobble when put on the floor. Finally, while I say the basket is pretty sturdy, it's not very rigid. After putting my locks in the basket for a semester, I've noticed significant bulging and dents.Overall Impression:It's not very expensive and it holds quite a bit of stuff. Also, Topeak has pretty good customer service so if the mounting area ever does break, they will replace it for free. I bought it because I needed and basket and it's a lot more elegant than using a milk crate secured with zip ties."

66149,0,"The safe is a good size safe to store important documents or anything of value. The only bad thing about this type of safe is the combination part of it. I wish I would have gone with something that had a number key pad or just key lock. You would think the combination lock would be easy to open because it's big. But sometimes it will take 10 try's or more to open it and doing nothing different then the first 9 times. Gets frustrating at times, but other then that, I guess it does it's job."
349453,2,"This is not feedback for the seller, per se, because I already left positive feedback to them because the shipping was incredible and the price is more than fair. However, if you're looking to buy these PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TITLE AND THE PHOTO ARE NOT THE SAME THING, AND YOU WILL GET WHAT IS IN THE PHOTO, NOT THE TITLE. The title says the gauge is ""Regular Light"" but they are in fact just ""Light"". I don't know if the lister meant to say 'regular' as in 'just plain ol' or something.. but that is kind of a stupid error to make, honestly. there is a big difference, and if you're not an amateur guitarist, it is a HUGE difference. I wanted ""Regular Light Gauge"" strings, which D'Addario makes, but instead i got exactly what is in the picture... ""Light"" gauge, which are a little clunkier. If you aren't a serious guitarist you might be smirking at this review, but if you are, you'll know what i'm talking about.PLEASE FIX THE LISTING"
393670,1,"After reading reviews on many row machines, I ordered this one. It works pretty well. Once in a while one of my repetitions gets ""stuck"" meaning that it isn't smooth..but it always returns to gliding smooth which is why I didn't return it. It might need some lubrication. The digital monitor is helpful because it gives the count, calories burned, and time lapsed. I'm not sure that I believe the calories burned though. After doing 200 repetitions at level 6 (approx. 15 minutes on the machine), it says that I only burned 50 calories! If that is true, then a row machine is only good for toning and a stationary bike gives you more bang for your buck (I burn around 300 calories in 30 minutes). Still, I feel that it is a good addition to anyone's home gym since you feel it in your arms, back, legs, and abs."

106949,1,"Upon purchasing this belt I was a little skeptical because there are so many other belts out there to choose from. I had also read other reviews from different brands that stated it was a waste of money. I consider myself to be very frugal and I didn't want to see money go down the drain, but I can honestly say that this belt was one of my best buy's. Until you get the belt adjusted where it needs to be it will jiggle while your moving, which is annoying. Some reviewers said that it doesn't fit smaller frames, but I disagree. I am 5'1"", and 118lbs. and it fits me well. When I did my first run with the belt it took me about 2 miles to figure out how to get it tightened to my liking, after that it was perfect. I purchased this belt for my long runs (9 miles and on). I also used it for a half marathon, which was great because the two bottles carried just enough water to get me to the finish line without having to stop at the water stations. The best part, as you get closer to the end of your run you feel like you can just keep on going because once the bottles are empty you have less weight, which feels like your getting your second wind. I also recommend this belt over the four bottle belt ""fuel belt"" has out. Carrying more than two bottles on your belt is going to make you feel heavier and will be harder on your run. I definitely recommend this belt for long distance runs."
89440,1,"First off, I recommend you get a shotgun with this already installed if you don't already have the gun. The receiver needs to be drilled and tapped to mount the rear ghost ring. I had a hard time finding a gun smith who would do this. If you have someone who will do this (and you trust them) it is a great addition to the 870. I much prefer this to rifled or bead sight. I haven't had to use the night sight part yet, but the rear tubes are smaller than the front. This makes since as you would probably have a hard time seeing the front sight (due to brightness) if they were the same size."
485039,2,"I purchased two of these kits (8 panels) and mounted them on the top of my RV. I have had them on the top of my RV now for approximately 8 months.When I received the units, I tested each of them for the open voltage measurement noted in the instructions with a digital meter and found each to be producing 21 volts unloaded. Encouraged that the panels were working properly, I went ahead and took the time and expense to mount them to the top of my RV.After 8 months, here's what I found:First of all, the 15 watt, 1 amp peak output rating that Sunforce advertises is not correct. The peak output rating for each of these panels should have been advertised at approximately 750 milliamps per panel. The total peak output that one could typically expect from the 4 panels in this kit would be around 3 amps. 3 amps under perfect conditions.I have noticed that the boards are extremely prone to large drops (upwards of 45%) in current output when they begin to heat up. In other words, the boards are VERY intolerant to high temperatures. But even under perfect conditions, the 8 panels that I have mounted on my RV only produced 6 amps, and I am in Hawaii.Another problem: The boards shut down in lower light situations. In other words, early morning and later afternoon lighting, significant cloud cover, or other low light situation will be cause for either a total shut down of output, or the boards will be very poor performers - in the low milliamps for 8 panels in parallel.Within a very short period of time (about 4 months) the output from the panels gradually decreased by nearly 50%. And right now I am getting about 40% of the advertised peak output in perfect conditions.The plastic construction is very cheap, in my opinion, and I am now worried that the plastic may break away around the screws that hold down the panels and fly off the vehicle. Needless to say, I am removing the panels.I'm out some money, a lot of time and effort, but I've learned a lot about solar panel technology over the past 8 months.For just a few bucks more, I will purchase a decent monocrystilline, 36 cell panel that will far and away outproduce the 8 panels that I have on my RV now, and take up far less space and be much safer on top of the vehicle.Don't waste your time or money on this kind of solar panel technology. You will be very sorry."

243327,0,"This gun was pretty good. It has 300 fps with a .12 bb. The bad thing about this gun is that it is not accurate, not even with a .20 bb. The reason it sucks with accuracy is because the gun is small, it has a small barrel. Compared with my friends pistol is is about a good inch shorter so this gun is for close range shooting. Oh and by the way if you ever shoot this gun at a can from point blank range it will not make a whole."
75568,1,"This cooler is excellent! I've got 4 of them now that I use when I go deer hunting. They are just under the 62"" maximum dimension for luggage (almost every other cooler is just over) an I can put frozen meat inside to within a couple inches of the lip and be just under the 50# limit for excess weight charges. I put a few layers of bubble pack on the to take up the extra space. I have had meat in these 48 hours and as long as they remain closed (just opening for the TSA inspection) the meat has stayed rock hard. I've traveled with them in the winter and summer with the same results. 2 of the chests have traveled wth me for 4 years, round trip to Indiana from Southern CA; each round trip is 6 airline segments, so that's 24 flights and all are still solid with no missing handles, cracks or damage.These are absolutely the best coolers for the traveling hunter!!! I carried almost 4 deer home from Indiana this year and everything stayed perfect. Last summer I carried home an antelope from Wyoming in late August, across the dessert with just bagged ice, with daytime temperatures near 110, and everything did fine.And of course if I can trust my wild game meat in these coolers, which is very hard to come by and to replace, you can count on them for your regular cold or frozen neeeds!!"

They claim to know these machines in and out, but they don't know where the foot pedal mount is located. It's obviously people at a telephone reading a book. Then they required I be able to fax for my warranty to be effective, and then that I have a digital camera to upload photos of supposed damage. In the new world, you must have a digital camera, internet, and a fax machine to hold companies liable for the product they manufacture.The elliptical itself is a decent machine. It's a bit tough for a new person and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone who isn't an experienced, or atleast seasoned, athlete or active person.I haven't used an elliptical since last summer following a car accident, and I found it fairly tough to get used to. It is what it is though and it'll only make me a better runner.

33085,1,"Nice pants, generously sized - I often take a 36 waist, and the days of 34 are in the past... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two: a pencil/screwdriver shaft section plus the rest, which isn't quite big enough for a smartphone. Get a seam unpicker though, and you can turn it into one larger pocket that's ideal for a phone, complete with light velcro fastener at the top.All pants should have a phone pocket these days, preferably a subtle one."
73282,2,"Updated Review: Did they change the description recently to say ""men's""?? I eventually got a small sweatshirt, which is nice and normal in every way (except maybe the puffy sleeves, which aren't very warm). Then my partner bought me another small in a different color and.. Ugh. The 2nd small sweatshirt is very different: absurdly small neck hole, tighter shoulders or ? that makes the sleeves ride up my arms so that the wrist bands feel scratchy and too tight. I suppose for this price you sacrifice quality control.There is no way any human body would fit in the small sweatshirt but have a neck the size of a small boy. It's not like a turtle neck, just very small and tight - ridiculous! So I removed the neck ribbing, and it looks like a new manufacturer spec'd the neck hole for the size WITH the ribbing, as the new ribbing-removed hole is the exact size of the hole of the first sweatshirt WITHOUT ribbing removed. Won't buy one again, and bummed that my new sweatshirt is now raggedy and can't be worn out of the house.----Looking again at the main page for this sweatshirt - it's apparently unisex. The model is a dummy after all. In any case, as a woman who normally wears between a medium and large shirt (have to go larger because of shoulders), I was surprised that the medium sweatshirt is MASSIVE. I should have ordered a small, but I was too enchanted by the softness and beautiful green color to send it back before wearing it. It is even more comfortable than I'd expected, but the sleeves are just too long, and the arm and body areas are huge. I get cold in it unless I wear a long sleeve shirt under it, due to air flow."

The shoes should give a long life if used only for Martial Arts."

The first issue we had was that one of the placstic frames did not have the holes drilled through that you use to attach the back support to so we had to drill through. The second and weird issue was that three of the four balls were smaller than the fourth. They did not fill the space for the frame and sunk through to the ground. It was like the ""mold' was changed or something. The fourth was fabulous and we wished they would all have been as useful.I wish the quality would have been higher. Maybe another brand would have been better?"

308460,1,"I was just getting into indoor rock-climbing when my instructor recommended this gadget to strengthen my wrist and grip, and he was right!PROS:1. It does what it says! As long as you can get the gyroscope 'going', then you can feel the torque and the resistance... the faster you can move it, the more resistance you feel and more effective the workout! I heard it is great for those who are recovering from hand and wrist injuries (but since I have never had either, I cannot comment on this).2. It's small and portable. You can definately carry it anywhere3. You can make your own exercises. Once the gyroscope motor is activated, you can treat it like a dumbbell; you can do almost any type of forearm and wrist exercise with it AND can switch between both your hands and reverse the direction of the gyroscope for a more intense workoutCONS:1. May be difficult to start! To get this gadget to work, you can either use your hand to get the inner-core going, or the shoe-string rope that comes with the Gyro (thing of it like an old fashion top). It took me DAYS to figure it out (and many Youtube videos), but once you got it, you won't forget it.2. It's noisy. Don't try this at work! It's best to either do in the comfort of your home or at some place that is already noisy.I guess that is it. Hope this helps!"

279390,0,This bed is awesome because it brings it's own pump inside so you wont miss place it. It's extremely comfortable to sleep in it BUT EXTREMELY NOISY! every time you move it makes that squeeky noise the plastic material stretches and it makes noise and ALOT OF IT. So it's a really comfortable and noisy bed. I've had it for some time now and it's in excellent shape but that noise will never go away!.. So if your a person who moves alot during sleep this bed is NOT for you it even makes noise when you get in it and off of it

323443,1,"This is what I was looking for: an every day watch. It is not too big, light weight, water proof, quartz and analog, stop watch (for cooking, sports, parking time, etc.) I just love it! Nice bright light to see the time at night. I have a more expensive swiss watch, it looks great, but I hardly ever use it. This is really all what I need from a watch."
426571,1,"This bag is fantastic. It's a great piece of carry-on that can stow a deceptively large amount. When fully loaded, the backpack feature is a relief due its support straps across your chest and waist which distribute the weight nicely. When you're carrying less, the bag has good compression options and can be easily carried via the handle or the shoulder strap.I've fit a lot of stuff into this bag, and, when combined with mesh travel bags, it can easily keep a weeks worth of clothes and other trip essentials. To give an approximation of the size (and I suppose usefulness) of the bag, I'm able to wear it on my back when I go grocery shopping on my motorcycle--the bag opens up like a clamshell and I can literally drop in a full-size, fully loaded paper grocery bag right inside the main compartment with plenty of wiggle room to spare, and no need to pack and repack the groceries.One final note: When I received my bag it didn't have the shoulder strap enclosed. I went to Osprey's site and filled out their parts request form and a few days later my strap arrived. Great customer service experience."

174356,0,"Good disposable emergency travel binocularsI bought these binoculars to leave in my SUV as an emergency backup when I forget my excellent Nikon 7216 Action 8 X 40 Binoculars. They are much lighter and smaller and I can leave in my map holder on the door or even in my pocket and forget I even have them which leaves the old saying binoculars are only good if you have them with you. And that's where these binoculars shine they are very tiny and very light.They do bring things in close and after a little bit of focusing and adjusting width you can make things out if you have plenty of light. The little case they come with is pretty decent as well.Now for the bad parts. The eye relief is pretty bad, you will have to prop your eye glasses above them and or remove them to use. Also they are pretty dim which of course a lot of cheaper 10x25 binoculars are. The strap is a small little string that does the job but is pretty thin. But hey for the price go ahead and purchase a couple one for your coat pocket and one for your vehicle oh and maybe one for your camera bag.These would be a great pair to have children learn on as if they drop or abuse them its no big deal.Pros:Nice caseSuper small sizeSuper light weightDisposable price tagGreat learning binocular to hand to small childrenCons:So so focusingJust Ok low light abilityJust Ok opticsNot water tight or resistantVerdict:Purchase as disposable emergency travel binoculars and or as a toy for children to learn birding with and no more.12-3-2008 Update:Went to the store and tested a lot of different small bincoulars trying to find a pair that are almost as good as my Nikon Action 7216 8x40's and found the perfect one. If you need small and want a good view and a good price get the Nikon 7508 Travelite 8 X 25mm V Binoculars. They are: light (8.9 oz), fit the hand well are well made and very bright in the viewfinder for their size."

267275,0,Received and immediately opened and inflated. Green ball had a hole in it. There is no value advantage if I have to pay someone to package and send back. Also there is no value advantage if the total price is for 5 usable balls instead of six. DISSAPOINTED!
37118,1,"The product description had me at ""30 tablets individually sealed in foil pouches"". The iodine tablets tend to come in little jars that have an uncertain shelf life once opened. So, these 30 individual pouches are now dispersed amongst various packs, bins, and vehicles. Perfect.The general rule is 1 gallon per person per day. That's 4 tabs per person per day of emergency, unless you can boil the stuff ...At $2 per gallon, I wouldn't use these for purifying a lot of water if I had other options. For example, tossing a 7 gallon container of tap water into the truck gives me about the same amount of treated water as the 30 tablets could provide. Also, never underestimate the usefulness of a gallon of bleach."
355972,1,"Now I would love to give this hammock a 5 star rating, but one thing that really bugs me about it is it stretches like you wouldn't believe. After about an hour of laying in it, I normally have sunk about a foot and need to go tighten the straps more to account for the material stretch. Normally you only have to do this once but it is still an annoyance. Other than that it is a wonderful hammock and seems to be well built. Would definitely recommend."

69533,1,"I love these little tabs. I usually dissolve one in my drinks bottle and leave it in the fridge for my early morning run. This is just for cool rehydration; the actual tabs dissolves pretty explosively in about 20 seconds or so.I have the mixed flavor pack. My favorite is probably the lemon and lime, but they are all fine. I'm not really savoring the flavor while I'm pounding the pavement, if you know what I mean.The bottom line is: I found them to be highly effective in increasing my comfortable range. I have suffered from the dreaded runner's trots, but these helped, even a little more than water alone. I usually run around 6 or so miles on my longer runs, but with these I felt so fresh I did my first half marathon length training run. Double the distance, just from good hydration! Highly recommended.p.s I combined them with theFuebelt R3O Revenge Hydration Beltand split the electrolyte drink between two of the bottles."

One caveat, the mount does not seem sturdy, so I decided not to install it. The key even has a led light built into it. One other issue is that the plastic on it sometimes loosens up so you need to remember to tighten it back, or it won't lock; this can be frustrating if you don't realize what is causing the lock not to work."

I wanted a simple digital scale to measure road maps, but after wading through the confusing instructions, punching button after button to set up time zones and such, I finally got to the map measurer part. It required so many mathematical calculations to make the conversion to the proper scale that my head was spinning - and then when I used it on a local map where I knew the actual distances, it was way off. On top of that, the last digit on the LED screen would only light up partway. Poor quality, very difficult to understand and operate - I sent it back for a refund."

The socks fit well and are very comfortable. They are light for the hot Afghan summer. My feet don't blister and they don't smell bad either. The socks dry quickly and don't have any lasting odor once dry. The only problem I have had with them is that they fall down my calf. There is only a small portion at the top that has elastic material and it ends up slipping down and annoying me. I prefer socks with elastic all the way up the calf. I also bought Keen Boulder Canyon and Smartwool mid cushion crew socks. The Smartwool have been the most comfortable, but wear out quickly. The Keen have been the best overall."

Disappointed in the advertising more than the product."
476514,0,"The Quickpump accompanied a queen-size Coleman inflatable air bed. The secret to using the pump successfully is to let it run for 5-10 minutes after the mattress first reaches it full size. Stopping too soon will result in an uncomfortable mushy mattress that folds around you every time you move. Even if keep the pump running until the mattress is very firm, it's easy to lose it when removing the pump from the valve. Pay attention to the instructions and take advantage of the double-valve feature to avoid losing the most air. In retrospect, I wish I'd spent a little more money and purchased an Aerobed, thereby avoiding the hassles of the battery-operated pump."

They will be soaking wet!It may seem like a simple enough thing to sip out of a bottle, but I tell you, it will take some practice. I now wait until the precise moment (at a full stop or in a fluid motion already) to try and sip from my Kanteen. Sometimes, both my husband and I will get out of the car both looking like we peed our pants... no joke. And I am a fairly competent and motor-skilled person. But after 2 months, we are greatly improved on the technique.2-They do DENT very easy... very very easy... so don't expect them to stay pretty long3-No matter what I have read in reviews, no matter what people say, the last sip of water from the bottom of the canteen tastes like sucking on a nickel... and yes, even though the water is clean, there is often a ""metallic"" smell that at times is overpowering and you feel like you are again, sucking on a nickel... maybe it is all in my head...PROs1-They are so ""cool"", you can be like ""I am saving the environment"" and other moms are so jealous even if you are only using them because..2-They really save $$$, we went through 3 cases of water a week... and now we use the Klean Kanteens with a Brita pitcher (which is a different pain to review), so even though expensive, they have already paid for themselves twice over in 2 months time3-They are just so cool! Everyone is jealous!I tell you, when I am hot and thirsty, I still just want to grab a cold bottle of water from the fridge... it may take a long time to get over... but the Klean Kanteen does its job, after you become skilled, and is a money/environment saver that makes you look cool!

They sent back the same watch and strap and said it should work. One month later....same problem. Two years ago I purchased the F11 in hopes that paying more would alleviate the problem. The exact same problems have arisen after 18 months. Spoke to technical support once again and they said to send it in, pay another $25 (not to mention the shipping fees) and they would check for problems. I felt that there must be something else causing the same problem but went ahead and had the batteries in the chest strap and the watch replaced. Next day....same problem. I now have nothing good to say about Polar. Consumer Reports just noted that the Timex Personal Trainer T5G971 for only $50 is their highest rated heart-rate monitor. Sorry Polar."

Having you lean on your elbows is a better workout then just laying down.The lengthening lunges is a mix of a lot of plies, squats, lunges. The only move I liked was a very deep curtsy you repeat about 16x.The Floor moves for the lower body s done mostly on your back, more about stretching, ballet moves & leg lifts. There is one move I like which is isometic pulling your raise straight leg back down while your arms try to pull it up & reverse those directions. The only other is a deep soas stretch which is done like the yoga hero pose with only one kne bent in front of you & then circle & lay on your back.The pace of these workouts is like YogaGirl said.... slow, easy with breaks almost as long as each workout move is in between every move. A bit too easy for even me. These dvds I agree with YogaGirl are best for those out of shape or getting back into exercising.You can see previews at deantedance com or other sites they sell the dvds."
375217,1,My daughter thinks this is the best nose clip she has ever tried. It is comfortable and no water leaks when using it. It appears to be very durable - we have had it for about a year - it still looks new. This is a much better design than the plastic ones that won't adjust to your nose. The only problem is that all her friends like it so much they all want to borrow it!!!

But we do not use ours for &quot;outdoor&quot; activities as the introduction would lead you to believe.We use ours every time we have a power outage - usually in the winter.After using them, I just remove the bottom door and plug them into an outlet so that they will be fully powered the next time we need them - no worry about batteries leaking, or being 'borrowed' from the lantern for use in a toy...........They get us through our 'darkest days'."
347740,0,"I just opened the box and checked out this poker chip set. I was somewhat suspicious about the low cost and wasnt sure what id be getting. I thought id share a few thoughts. First of all 1000 chips is ALOT of chips!! I didnt realize how big (and heavy) the carrying case was going to be. For casual play amongst 3-6 players i would go with the 500chip set - 1000 is quite a load to carry around and kind of overkill. I also am not sure if i like the denominations on the chips themselves- may just be a personal preference. I think ill suspend my view on that till i start playing with them.The chips themselves are nice - solid, heavy classic type chips. Thats the main strength of the set. I would say my main gripe is with the carrying case - at least for this 1000 chip set, its too flimsy. I dont think the handle or the clasps are going to last long. You can just tell the amount of material they put in the case does not match the heaviness of the chips. It even opens abit on the sides from the pressure. Ill probably get a different case down the road. The case would actually be nice for other items, like important larger papers, documents etc- just not designed for heavy items.The dice and the playing cards are a nice addition - and really for $60 your getting a deal with all the chips and extras. Just realize your going to be straining your arm carrying this thing around - and that the case is nothing to write home about. All in all a good deal - but wish i had got the 500 set and a better case."

127406,0,"So the concept is good but the execution not so much. I mean like it is what the product claims it to be--> A rear view mirror for the cyclist but what they don't tell you is that the mirror is PRETTY small (and I ordered the original size) and to add to the voes it is not even convex in its curvature so as to allow a wider field of vision. So what you get is a tiny piece of glass that reflects a true image instead of a compressed image for rear-viewing. So that causes a serious problem in my opinion because while biking you essentially have this little piece of glass which you almost can never adjust it well enough so as to not have your own face come in the view and still end up giving you a clear picture of what's behind you.What I mean by the above is that if you really want to see the road behind you, you will end up putting it at such an angle that part of your face WILL block the view. If you tilt it more obliquely then it will provide the rear view at an angle which can be very disorienting while biking. The lack of a convex fish-eye vision makes for a very very small area in which you can see anything of the rear view.Thus my review title. This little piece of mirror takes a LOT of getting used to. Setting the right angle is a major pain in the a$#. Once you get it right you will still be constantly straining yourself to look at a tiny part of the rear view. And this constant straining to get a half-decent ""look"" while biking at high speeds can be dangerous. Add to this another negative and that is that this mirror vibrates a lot with your movement and the bike's vibration. So you have a few negatives going against this little mirror summarized as follows:1) Field of vision is very tiny. Makes for some dangerous straining of your eyes to focus while riding. Or you have to squint and look with one eye.2) The mirror is not convex so it gives a very small area to look at. Very annoying.3) The mirror vibrates a lot while you are biking. Add to that a small surface area makes for a very disorienting and shaky rear-view4) The longer arm of the mirror cannot be tilted outward so the mirror ends up creating a blind spot in your left eye (for riding on American roads)and has your face cover a part of the view.But I still give it 3 stars because it is priced for someone who is on a budget. And at this price, it still provides you ...well a REAR view so to speak. SO if you can get used to it and not get distracted by the blind spot or disoriented by constantly struggling to get the view then I say go for it. I wish the mirror were larger, convex and that the arms moved more so you could get a rear view while not creating a blind spot for yourself."

479091,0,"Under product features it states ""100% Cotton"" they are actually 58% polyester/42% cotton (at least the 2 I received which were Large colors-Graphite and Oxford). They will breathe, only because they are VERY lightweight. Very thin cotton that I do not expect to last more than a few washings. I would have been better off getting basic Hanes color T's at Walmart for $3.99 each.UPDATE 12/4/2009 - 3 years old now and they have held up fine. After researching the Russell Athletic website the gray tones are a poly mixture, the other colors are 100% cotton. If you are looking for the old-school heavy duty quality search for ""Russell Athletic PERFORMANCE"", these are the T's I grew up with and last for decades, but I'm overall happy with the basic line."

440429,1,"For a $30 dollar scope you cannot go wrong. I zeroed it in with 6 shots at 25 yards. At this distance the red dot will completely cover up a 1 3/4"" square. This is because of the 5 MOA rating. If you need more precision, go to a lower MOA and a higher price. Also keep in mind that this scope does not magnify. After zeroing the scope I set up 16 bottles on a log at 25 yards and blasted every one of them without missing one shot. It is a cool looking set up on my Hi-Point 995TS 9mm carbine."

I have an average sized wrist and I'm using the biggest size. I would almost change the title of the watch to Puma TEEN'S Futuristic Watch rather then Men's, as it won't be fitting too many men."
65551,1,"It is cheap so I didn't expect much. My friend bought the Giro one and it is very similar in terms of build quality and features. The main difference seems to be the name and color selection. I bought this as I would not care if it was stolen and if I do have to use it in-case I fall it is cheap to replace. Helmets are only good for one fall. It fits comfortably, has an adjustable head strap in the rear and two adjustable straps for the ears. Of course it also adjust under the chin. Vents well. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the front clip doesn't adjust like other helmets but cant expect too much for the price. Overall I am satisfied."

What I didn't get was a hat that could withstand wind. any wind. at all.The brim of the hat has nothing to either weigh it down or stiffen it, so when the wind blows your sun/rain protection disappears- the brim folds back against your head and no longer offers protection. I've resorted to buying a lightweight chain from the hardware store and putting inside the brim all the way around.

212783,0,"My son received this bike for his second birthday from my inlaws. He is taller than most 3 year olds and is off the chart for height for his age because he is so tall. The claims are this bike can be used for ages 2 and up, simply not true. It should be ages 4 and up. His feet barely (only his tip toes) reach the petals on the trike which is NOT adjustable (only the chopper setting is). I am very disappointed as he was so excited to have his first bike and he cannot ride it. The quality seems OK. For the price I would recommend a different bike because I really don't see this bike lasting 5 years. The stickers are already loose and it is brand new. The tires are the cheap hard plastic which I hate on any wheeled product since it cracks and doesn't last. I expect better from Radio Flyer."
183923,2,"I bought two of these tables for a casino night. They both came and had identical defects. The plastic trays have two small springs attached to a plastic pin. The plastic pins are supposed to fit between the layers of the felt top and hold the trays in. On both tables, about 1/3 of the pins were either bent or broken. They are very fragile and bend when you insert the trays into the felt top. The result is that you can't insert most of them into the felt top and have them lie flat. Since a couple had BOTH pins bent, I discovered that you could lay the trays flat without the pins, although they aren't secured. Since I need them for my event, and since it would be a hassle to return the two 30 lb each tables, I called Amazon and got a $15 ""discretionary"" refund for each of them, so that I only paid $35 each. Not ideal, but this partially compensates for it. However, I was really annoyed to find that there was another version which looks IDENTICAL on Amazon for $44, $6 less (it is here:Trademark Deluxe Poker and Blackjack Table Top with Case. Oh well."

33782,2,"For anyone thinking a small manual treadmill might be the way to go, you may want to think again. I got this thinking its small size would be an asset, as I could store it anywhere I chose. But I soon found out that manual treadmills are a hell of a lot of work, they are much harder to use than a motor driven treadmill is.As others have stated this thing has no height adjustment on the rear, so in my experience the angle this treadmill sits at means I end up going a lot faster than I would like, and the tension adjustment seems to do next to nothing in terms of changing the speed. I ended up having to build a small wood platform on the back so I could adjust the level of the treadmill as needed.Also after only one use 3 screws holding the bottom part together were already stripped out and I had to re-secure them with wood glue, so its not exactly the best built treadmill you will ever find either."
400553,0,"I bought my RCBS primer to replace a Lee I'd purchased back in the 80s, mainly to get the built-in primer feed tray. It does work pretty well, and it's built like a tank. The curved metal band you see in the photo serves as a gate to isolate the primer being loaded from those in the tray- a good safety feature. I found, contrary to some reviewers, that Lee shell holders worked in it as well as the RCBS shell holder I bought for it. Still, I have a few issues with it.First, the primer rod, as others have noted, *will* fall out if you tip the primer over. That's not good. Being used to the Lee, I had to chase the rod on the floor a few times before I learned to keep it upright. You also have to be careful when inserting the priming rod. It's rounded on one end, where it contacts the lever that pushes it up, and flat on the end that contacts the primer. Put it in upside down- which is very easy to do- and you'll end up denting your primers, resulting in an unsafe load. A more serious problem (to me, at least) is that there's only one priming tray for both large and small primers. I load primarily .38 target wadcutters, and I found that unless you were very careful, small pistol primers had a disconcerting habit of flipping sideways or upside down as they moved from the tray to the loader. It's inconvenient, as well as possibly dangerous, to load a primer upside down.So while I like this primer, and it's certainly built better than the Lee, I find that the Lee is less troublesome in practice. I haven't yet tried the new Lee Ergo primer, or the Hornady, so I'm still looking for the ideal priming too.Update: I'm now using the new Lee Ergo priming tool. It has great feel- even better than the RCBS- and it doesn't have the problem with primers flipping over in the tray when the lid is on. On the other hand, it doesn't do as good a job as the RCBS of flipping primers when the tray lid is off. Maybe I'll try the Hornady tool next ;-)"

448611,0,"This is your typical sporting goods/department store comfort/hybrid bicycle. It has a near bottom of the line Shimano RD-TZ30 rear derailleur, a front Falcon derailleur / Suntour crank combo, SRAM MX twist shifters, linear pull V-style brakes, an adjustable seat shock, front shock, and an aluminum frame. The seat tube length is 18"", the top tube length is 21"", and the stand over height is ~28 - 30"" (top tube slopes down to the seat tube). From the seat tube and stand over height, this bike is sized for someone with a 30' - 32"" inseam.The bike comes partially assembled. You have to put the handlebars, front wheel, seat, and pedals on. You will need metric size Allen wrenches. The gears were adequately factory set, but the brakes needed to be adjusted.I purchased it for occasional street recreational riding. For this purpose, this bike is average. If you want something with better components (more expensive) then look at the GT Nomad / Timberline, Schwinn Sierra / Voyageur, or the Giant Sedona.Pros: Better price than I found at a local sporting goods chain store and free shipping. Amazon shipped it double boxed. Light aluminum frame. Comfortable seat with adjustable shock tension. Linear pull V-style brakes. Adequate for recreational street biking, which is what about 90% of us do.Cons: Components, but you get what you pay for. Front and rear wheels are not quick disconnect. One size, if your tall or short this bike will probably be a bad fit for you."

421894,1,"I bought an E100 from Amazon for my 7-year-old son about 45 days ago. I can tell you that only rain and wet roads have prevented him from riding it daily!At first, my wife and I questioned my judgment in buying it for him. The first time he got on it, he lost control of it had a bad-looking crash. He hopped up unharmed though, so we gave him some time to learn. Every day since then, I have found him being diligent to charge it and eager to ride it.So, here's my list of pros and cons.Pros:1. The battery lasts a good hour of uphill/downhill riding.2. The large, pneumatic tire up front makes quick work of bumps and rocks.3. The wide standing surface allows for his feet to be together, side-by-side, if he wants.4. The scooter is sturdy and solid.5. The handlebars and shaft can be separated from the body for transport.6. It's quick enough for fun, but not so fast as to be dangerous.7. It ships in two pieces: Handlbars/shaft assembly and the main body. Attaching the two pieces is all the assembling that's necessary.Cons:1. The brake is insufficient. It will eventually stop the scooter, but don't let your kid(s) rely on it. Teach them to steer out of situations and release the throttle. It will not stop my 9-year-old (65 lbs) son when he's rolling down our slightly sloped driveway. Of course, the effectiveness of the brake is directly proportional to the strength of the rider's grip, but the gripping power of kids in this age group is probably less than what this scooter-brake combo needs.2. The rear wheel is like one on a regular Razor scooter - solid and slick. This works well on most dry surfaces, but be careful because it can and will slide in more situations than a grooved, rubber tire would.3. The drive chain attaches on right side of the back wheel, and it has a cover over it. That sounds like it should be a good thing, but the cover is actually so large that it prevents most right turns. If you turn more than just a little to the right, the cover will make contact with the road, and the back wheel will lose contact with the road.Notes:1. There is an on/off switch on the battery.2. The motor engages after the scooter reaches 3 mph.3. The manual recommends charging the scooter for 12-18 hrs.4. The scooter is heavy enough to render it useless without the motor. Don't expect that your kid will continue to use it as a push scooter when the battery dies.5. The scooter did NOT ship in plain packaging. It shipped in just the scooter box. It was for my son's birthday, and the surprise was nearly spoiled when delivery came.Summary:This scooter is a good buy for the money, and so long as you are aware of the issues that come with it, it will make for a fun toy. My son still tells me that this scooter is the best present he has ever received! If you have the money to get the 200 or 300, I would recommend doing so as long as you're comfortable with the increased speed/power."

195640,0,"I bought one of these last-second for a camping trip. It works pretty well. There's just one fan speed, the button is good, it moves a good amount of air but you can't get too far from it, and it's relatively quiet. The magnet on the bottom is MASSIVELY powerful for such a small, lightweight fan. I guess Coleman was worried a weaker magnet would cause this unit to fall off of things too easily. The metal plate is great for securing the fan to a tent wall, and the magnet redily locks onto metal tent poles or whatever. I've used it for probably 150 hours now and have only gone through 2 batteries, so it's pretty energy efficient.My only complaint is that the material the main housing is made out of isn't as durable as it should be (especially with that big magnet working on it). There are two notches in the plastic base that the battery-door (which also holds the magnet) uses to close. One clip is broken on mine because the magnet held while the unit came away when I went to pull it off a tent pole. That's why only 3 stars. If Coleman made this out of more durable plastic (or built a more durable closing mechanism, it would be better.But hey, it's cheap for what it is. Still worth what I paid for it."

It looks like one of the more expensive balls as far as the texture goes. It felt fine when I bounced it around in my room. However, where it seems to fall short is on the actual court. As I started playing with it outside I realized it's just a rubber ball with some super bounce. You can just sort of slam it and it'll go about 10 feet in the air. I tried taking air out to take some the bounce away but it would continue to bounce pretty high but then also start to feel a bit flat. I would say this is a good ball to practice your dribbling. As far as using it to play a game, though, I suggest you check out something in the $25-35 range."

66133,1,"I bought this safe primarily to have a fireproof place to store important papers and computer backups. I'm satisfied that it will do what I want but I had a couple of surprises:1. The double locking system really means that it takes both a key AND a combination to open the safe. If you loose the key or forget the combination you will have some difficulty getting to your valuables. The safe can be ""single locked"" with just the key or just the dial, but it is very easy to double lock it by accident.2. I hadn't considered that fireproof did not necessarily mean air or water tight. I watched some video of fire testing and it came through with flying colors. The problem is that most fires also involve water damage when the fireman shows up to put out the fire. Some water is going to get inside if there is enough put on the safe during the fire suppression effort.The user documentation is ""OK"", and there is a web site that lets you recover your combination once you register. You can buy new keys there as well.The safe is heavy, but can be carried around by one person. I hauled it up two flights of stairs in the original packaging. It can be bolted down with the provided hardware and this seems like a good idea.The packaging consists of a cardboard box and four Styrofoam inserts. If the box is punctured or dropped the safe could be damaged. Mine was delivered by FedEx and had a dent in the back left section even though the box was undamaged.

252986,0,"This is pretty poor quality- the poles are plastic and not very strong, but it should hold up for one season. Comes with a volleyball, pump, 4 raquets, and poles/netting. Not bad for the price- don't expect quality though."
491564,0,"The 4 LED design is significantly better and brighter than the other options, making it the only choice for a light-up disc, but it isn't perfect.The Plastic:It just doesn't have that UltraStar feel Ultimate players want in a disc. This thing is rigid, and smacks you hard. The hard plastic also leads to some minor slices if you catch an edge just the wrong way.The Flight:This disc falls fast. I don't know where they came up with the ""farthest flying"" claim on their product description, but that's crap. This does not fly like an Ultimate disc, but it does handle well, and has a balanced flight path making it a suitable but noticeable night time option.The Lights:The 4 light points are spread far enough apart that your eye tracks them independently (especially if overhead). You see a swirling vortex of blue lights coming at you as opposed to a level plate. This can be disorienting, and will cause a few drops, but at least you can see the disc.The Black Jax brightness makes it the best option, but it's far from a homerun."

144612,0,I just got this pedometer. I have tested it while walking. On its lowest setting it overestimates my steps by about 5 to 10 percent. I have tested it about 10 times each time taking more than 100 steps outdoors. Everytime it has overestimated by that much. I am not very happy about it.Well now after 3 weeks of use it has stopped functioning right. It now overestimates my steps by around 30 to 40 percent. I am going to give it back.
265382,1,"Update Jan 2, 2011The knife itself is superb.The kydex sheath will not hold onto the knife blade unless the snap is closed. Sheath not as advertised, at least with this particular unit I own.If you hold the knife straight up and down, slide the sheath up the blade and let go, the sheath will fall to the ground as if dropped. What little blade gripping there was when new, wore off fast.All Kydex sheath/holsters are designed to hold item with molded tension, regardless of additional fasteners such as snapping thumb breaks, Velcro, etc.Since a replacement sheath would be out of pocket (if you can find one), the 4 star rating remains on this 5 star knife.I'm still owning this knife regardless what the sheath issues are.I'm also removing the ""made in Japan"" penalty. Noting that Cold Steel knives are not made in the USA anymore, no matter what your internet search tells you. Japan, Taiwan, China depending on model.For those who try to find American quality products first, beware the internet keeps the ""made in USA"" searches around long after the manufacturing has moved overseas. Check directly with the manufacturer before purchase.Purchased June 4, 2010This SRK is near indestructible quality. The kydex sheath does not fit as advertised.Mine was $73 out the door. The knife itself is superb. This thing is scary sharp out of the box.Bought this through Amazon Marketplace. Sold and shipped by ""Poorfish Outdoors"""
472309,1,"I've had this watch for about three weeks. It fits well after a minor change with the links. It looks and feels great. If I had to buy another watch it would be the the same one. It does have some issues, i.e. mine didn't roll to the next month but this is a minor issue compared to the overall picture. This watch does not need a winder as it has one built in. All and all I'm more than happy with it. Also it was delivered exactly when it was due."

85013,0,its ok but it doesn't shoot very far. Sometimes itll shoot more than one or two bbs but i dont care. Cocking is a little hard but not really. Also i disagree that it fells like the cocking device feels like its going to break. Its not very good but it works fine in close quarter combat
192798,1,"I'm an intermediate player, mostly pickup games at local parks. The ball does seem heavier than the newer pro match balls, but that works in its favor in rec play on the dry sun-hardened fields we have here. it runs truer on the bounce off the divots than lighter balls. I also like the way it lands on the foot out of the air- it has a nice weight, easy to kill the speed and control the landing.My first one developed a slight seam separation after a couple of months of sporadic rec play. My request took awhile to get to the US distributor (Regent Sports Corp.), but they replaced it, no problem."
328407,1,This is a great undergarment to keep my fat thighs rubbing together on long walks. I found these more comfy if I wore them without underwear.
4517,0,"After ordering, i was please to find them at my house sooner than the estimated arrival. I unwrapped them, and admired their weight and sturdiness. I went outside with my brother and we clashed swords. I hear a snap crack and the black one has a splinter from the tip to the center, that i know is only going to get worse. So if your gonna hit softly these are good for you. However if you plan on really hitting I might not advise getting these."
42117,0,"This gun is made of pretty sturdy plastic. Overall, the dimensions of the gun are pretty close to the real thing. Most of the finer details are just molded into the body, but it's to be expected considering how cheap this gun is. The folding stock is surprisingly sturdy, and the grips allow you to keep a pretty good hold on the weapon. In addition to the accessories listed, my gun came with a speed loader, a sling, and a ramrod to clear the barrel.Performance-wise, I can't say that I'm terribly impressed by this gun. Even after adjusting the hop-up, I found that my gun had a tendency to shoot towards the right, making the sights (and any attempt at aiming) virtually useless. I found that the first round after loading the clip usually came out a little underpowered, though subsequent shots gradually flew further and further. The rounds don't go very fast at all. I bought a set of drop targets from Dick's Sporting Goods, and even a direct hit from 10 feet wouldn't always cause them to fall.The redeeming quality of this gun is that the full-auto mode is *very* fast. You can usually expect to empty a full clip of 42 rounds in about 3 or 4 seconds. While the shots don't always end up in the same place, they do fly straight for about 30 feet before dipping. For CQB, you can't do much better in this price range.To sum up, the features of this gun at such a low price make it a good buy. If you do end up buying this gun, keep in mind that the average spring pistol will probably hit harder, fly farther, and fire more accurately than this thing. Ultimately, using this gun really just feels like holding a big toy. But if all you're looking for is a decent looking, fully automatic rifle at a rock-bottom price, then this is the gun for you."

67264,1,"I never reviewed pants before but Amazon suggested I do, so here goes. They're pants and I put them on one leg at a time. They're pants and I wear them outside so I don't get arrested in just my briefs. They're pants and they are long enough to hide the guilt of wearing mis-matched socks. In case I haven't made it clear enough..they're pants, and they are roomy enough so when I wear them at the shooting range, a red hot casing ejected from my .45 finds it way down the waist of my pants and down my leg. (ouch!)"
83398,0,"A couple of issues with this product, The one I got didn't work. I had to send it back and the selector switch had to be change (which is the triggerby the way.) The instruction don't tell you much of anything important likehow long to charge the battery. Power is just like it says (300 fps.)Nicely weighted down to feel real. The scope is junk, use the iron sight.In short, for the price it's a fun gun, not for battles.mgso"
318112,0,"I purchased several of these to give as casual gifts for co-workers. I find a knife a very useful tool. There's nothint special about these S&W knives. In fact I find them somewhat below S&W standard having owned a fantastic one. There's nothing inherently wrong, the steel is adequate and comes utility sharp. I haven't and won't bother to put a keener edge on any. Relatively inexpensive, if it breaks you won't care very much, but expensive enough you should expect it to not fall apart on you. I'm wouldn't want to rely on it in a pinch, but it's adequate for day to day or light industrial use. Stamped patterned metal grips not effective in extreme cold or when wet."

319654,2,Dont get these they dont fit just any pair of sunglasses. Doesnt stick very well either. Waste of money. I wish i could get my money back for this one.
454684,2,I purchased this product hoping to get everything it said and what was shown. It was not at all what I expected. It was not a watch and it was a bright yellow (not black) monitor-- it didn't even have a heart rate monitor on it at all. I spent a lot of money for a pedometer and stop watch which I could have bought somewhere else for a lot cheaper. It's the worst deal I have ever had on Amazon.
152492,0,"I bought this to use along with my Coleman stove for cooking at camp. The quality isn't great and it's smaller than I thought it would be, but for the price it's not bad. The burners are hard to adjust and it doesn't work well when it's windy, unless you built a windscreen around it.If your looking for a stove that's small and light, then you may like this. Otherwise, spend another $30 and get something better. I doubt this will last for many years like a quality stove will."
8367,1,"I bought two of these for our hybrids. The packaging is simple but there are (in my opinion) a lot of parts so, be careful not to lose anything. The installation of the first mirror was a little challenging but that's mainly because I wasn't following the directions correctly. I dropped one of the little washers on the floor and had a heck of a time finding it. But I managed to get it installed. I really like the mechansism that is used to attach the stem inside the handle bars. It works REALLY well. When I installed the second mirror, I did it in about 5 minutes.The quality of the parts appears to be very good, especially for the price. I would definately recommend this product.If you are going to be riding in the rain from time to time, I recommend putting some kind of defogger/repellent on the mirror because it does fog up. I may try some RainX to see if it solves the problem."
65636,2,"The helmet itself does not seem to be firm at all, it both looks and feels cheap. I could tell at the first time that if I wear it for a ride, my head would no longer stay.

304230,0,"I purchased the pack as a extended weekend pack for my 19 year old son. He is 6'0"" and weighs 220 lbs. This pack is listed as a 55 Liter pack. It is. It is well made and I will keep it for my wife. When he took it out of the box he tried it on. I looked at the packing materials. It is listed as a slim fit. It is for women and kids. It has a max waist of 32"". This is not in the description. I wanted a full sized internal frame pack for him. The brochure that came with the pack clearly shows it as slim fit and lists the proportions. The ad does not. It would be great for youth and women, but I do not feel it is a good fit for adults. It is a good weekend pack and I am keeping it for my wife. The ad needs to show the brochure which clearly show High Sierra packs and who they fit and size."
274387,1,"We ordered this tricycle for our son for his 2nd birthday a couple months ago. It is great for going on walks. The push bar is comfortable and easy to grip (though not ergonomically designed), which makes pushing a snap. Plus the bar allows you steer from behind at a normal standing stature, so there's no bending over to grasp the seat and the handle bars. My 6' husband does find the bar a hair shy of being at the minimum comfort level, so anyone over 6' may not find it as comfortable to push as a shorter person (you might still have to bend over). The construction is sturdy and durable, the wheels can go 'off-roading' at the park or on gravel.All in all a very good buy for the money! My son loves it. The bell and basket in back are also a huge hit with him. The only drawback, if it can be considered a drawback, is that you can't adjust the pedals to turn or not to turn as the trike is moving (they always turn)."
276432,0,If you need a purple shirt this is a good one. The cotton is of good quality and the fit is as should be expected. The printing is not cheap and will not flake off easily.
391924,1,"I purchased this Heart Rate Monitor from a retail store about 8 months ago. A friend purchased the same one around the same time. She is quite slim and has a hard time picking up her Heart Rate and keeping it. I'm also on the thinner side (but taller and not as slim) and have no problems. As long as the sensor is wet, it picks my heart rate up quickly and maintains the monitoring throughout my workout. I LOVE knowing how many calories I'm REALLY burning and it helped tremendously with my weight loss. (My goal was 15 lbs and it helped me lose the remaining 8 after I plateaued.)Now while pregnant, I wear it to make sure I'm not over-exerting myself too much.I love this product so much, I bought one for my husband, who also loves it.A great monitor for a great price!"

360030,1,"A nice and sturdy backpack by High Sierra, larger than many of their other backpacks. Does not hold as much as High Sierra's Access backpack, but this is a nice alternative to the Access, which holds just about everything you'd ever want to put in a pack. The Locker has shoe holders at each side, and while I haven't used the bag yet, I think it will work fine as a carry-on bad when I fly, or as a good daypack. I haven't tried to fit my 15.5 inch laptop in it, but it seems as though there will be room. Highly recommend this pack if you want a mid-size pack. Fabric is real sturdy, zippers work flawlessly, stitching is strong, and the bag looks cool (I bought the cyber blue one)."
121944,0,"I found my old baseball signed by the entire 1981 Giants (Vida Blue, Joe Morgan, Jack Clark among the signatures I recognize from my childhood team). Wanted a sturdy case to hold and protect the ball.The case itself is great. Clear and sturdy interlocking design. The black ball holder is uber thin plastic, but does the job. This would be a great deal except for one glaring thing: The two stickers on the black plastic ball holder were placed crooked, and ruins the entire look. One sticker is the Rawlings sticker and an MLB sticker on the opposite side. Both are rectangle stickers that nearly fill that side of the ball holder (meaning its a black sticker with a red rawling logo printed in the middle). Both were crooked, one was hanging off the black ball holder a little. i tried to pull it off carefully to reposition it, but it ended up ripping. Kinda lame. Maybe it's a one-off careless mistake... just be warned. Would be perfect if they just gave you the two sticker to stick on yourself if you choose."

328344,1,"I bought these for about $40 as a pair of cycling glasses on BT. They look great and sit well on my face. I would say I have a large face and these are very comfortable. I forget I'm wearing them sometimes and that's a quality I look for in any gear I buy, just put it on and go. I was worried about them being too small but there is a bit of give that allows the glasses to conform to the width of your face. The interchangeable lens are also very cool. You get 3 pair of lenses. A dark pair for sunny days, an orange pair for night or cloudy days and a clear pair for dusty/windy days. Can't go wrong here."

313678,0,"These are very comfortable gi pants. They are a good heavy weight, but soft cotton, not the heavy canvas type, flexible and easy to move in. I've had several different gi pants, and these are, by far my favorite. They are elastic waistband, rather than drawstring, but I prefer that. And as a female martial artist it can be difficult finding gi pants that fit well, but these are definitely the best I've worn.Update to this review: I had decided to purchase another pair of gi pants and ordered these again since I liked them so much the first time. Unfortunately, the gi pants that arrived this time were nothing like the first. The previous pants were brushed cotton, elastic waist. The pants I received the second time were the heavy canvas type material, drawstring waist, and had the ProForce label on the front, exactly what I did not want. I'm guessing the description is intentionally confusing because the pants come from different vendors and Tiger Claw has no idea what may really be shipping? At least I was able to return them without difficulty and was able to find another pair of gi pants elsewhere that fit perfectly. Just be aware when ordering the gi pants may be different than what you expect."

92611,0,"I bought the Gazelle in October 2006 after doing many hours of research. I had my second child in June and desperately wanted to take off 15 pounds of baby weight. Mostly everything I had read was positive so I convinced my husband that the Gazelle was an inexpensive way for me to get back into shape. I decided that I would use it for at least six months before writing a review so that I could give very accurate feedback.I will say that the Gazelle did help me take off the baby weight in about four months. For that reason I am glad I bought it BUT I had to work out on it for 30 minutes to an hour at least five or six days a week to accomplish that. I also did weight training and Pilates along with my Gazelle workouts. Here are the pros and cons I experienced with the Gazelle.Pros:* It's cheap! We got it for under $90 at Wal-Mart.* It's compact and fits well in the corner of my bedroom. I have never tried to fold it so I can't comment on how that works.* It is very easy to use. I could see this being great for seniors (without knee problems).* It can help you lose weight if you are willing to do a few extra things.Cons:* No resistance! I had read this on reviews but was hoping it would be okay for me since I was so out of shape when I started working out. Unfortunately I couldn't break a sweat on it so my husband went out and bought cheap bungee cords and strapped them around the legs. Luckily this did the trick and gave me enough resistance to get a decent workout in when I first started. Now that I am in better shape the bungee cords really aren't enough and I have to punch with small hand weights to get my heart rate up. Maybe the tapes other reviewers talked about would have helped so if you decide to buy this you might look into that.* I hate to say this but the Gazelle killed my knees!!! The entire time I used it five to six days a week I was in pain. I had read it was good for people with knee problems but it wasn't the case for me. I am stubborn and just fought through it for four months but eventually the pain got so bad I had to cut back my workouts on it. I have a friend that has a Gazelle and experienced the same problem.* It does squeak a lot. That really doesn't bother me but some people may be very annoyed with how squeaky it can be.Overall, I think the Gazelle is a decent piece of equipment for people that do not have knee problems. For me it takes a lot of effort to get my heart pumping and bothers my knees so it might not be right for everyone. After having so many knee problems with the Gazelle I started researching other inexpensive exercise options. I came across a ton of information about rebounding on mini trampolines so I decided to try that. If I could do things over I would have invested the money I spent on the Gazelle on a nicer mini trampoline because my workouts are so much more effective and I haven't experienced any knee problems. I think I will still use my Gazelle to vary my workout but it is now my second choice compared to the trampoline."

350172,1,Vest was very functional and performed its intended function. No problem with the valve which was very easy to use and maintained pressure when it was needed.

399678,1,"Not a whole lot to say about this knife at the moment since I just bought it. It is a discontinued item so you can find it for about $40 instead of the $70 retail. This is one sturdy knife!! Thus the title of this review. The knife alone weighs in at almost 15oz. I intend to make this my primary camping/survival knife and it seems like it will do a great job. It is a bit on the heavy side, but I plan to remove the grips and try to skim about 2oz off the total weight. It is very durable, 440 Stainless with a BLK powder-coat that should last a looooong time. The sheath is a hard thermoplastic with nylon around it which seems like it will be plenty durable. Also, there are screws which allow the sheath to be taken apart. Although I haven't gone out with it yet, it wasn't super sharp, so I put it to the stone, and can say that it took an edge very well. I was looking at the SOG Seal Pup as well as this one, but even thought I would much rather be carrying the weight of the SOG around, I cannot fathom this knife breaking down any time soon. I will try to remember to post an update after my next excursion. Just keep in mind, She is a beast; Built to last!"
111020,0,"Overall, the dartboard is decent for the money. It's not a $95 professional board, but it didn't cost $95. The darts, on the other hand, are garbage. Better off buying a different board without darts and buy good darts seperately.I'm dismayed at amazon's packaging - the board (in it's box) was fairly loose in shipping box - just a little packing paper stuffed into large box, so much so that one of the cheap plastic dart ends broke off from the banging around. It also appears that the board set was previously returned and then sold to me. Unfortunately Amazon only allows complete return of entire item and there doesn't seem to be any customer service people to talk with. I'd rather they give me a discount on a new set of decent darts than go through the hassle of returning board for exchange. Not worth it"

54768,0,"This red dot sight gizmo is available from various vendors and at various prices [** look around! I've seen it for as low as $14 and as high as $49!] but when it arrives, the 'instructions' [!?] and 'other' than how to pop in the 3 LR-44 batteries ""with + facing up into laser sight and tighten"" [sic], anyway, 'other' than that revelation, you are basically on your own! Yeah, the red dot made its appearance once the battery juice did its thing but there is not a single word on how to adjust the sight! There are ==4== very small holes on the front of the dot sight and you're supplied with both a thick allen wrench [** very cheaply made and the concurrent danger of quickly rounding out the hole adjustments] for the mounting piece AND a very thin [also cheaply made] allen wrench to make the elevation and windage adjustments but, the big question here, ==HOW== is that done! Of note: there are firstly two small holes on the 'top' of the sight ==and== two further holes on the 'bottom' [all of which can be adjusted with the thin allen wrench] of the sight but, hey, NOW WHAT? Put another way, what of these ==4== tiny adjustment holes does what? Anyone?It looks nice and for airguns it will probably do the 'sustained' trick due to the airgun lacking the shock recoil on a firearm pistol but, again, there are no instructions whatsoever as to the adjustment of the dot sight. You either tinker with it yourself and simply guess at what you're doing and hope for the best with those =4= adjustment holes or ask! So I'm asking!I gave it 3 stars simply because the laser dot works but I dropped 2 stars because not a word is mentioned how to adjust it 'plus', and I find this of some consideration, I found the 4 very tiny adjustment screws hardly able to stay in place once moved from their stop position. In effect, once ""set"", they would tend to move on their own because there is no way to lock them in place other than the old drop of candle wax thing. Don't scoff! I've seen that work on tiny adjustment screws on all sorts of things [to keep them from moving] where these adjustment screws of the tiny variety are easy to turn with the allen wrench left or right ==but== , ahhhh, the rub here, they 'also' fail to 'stay' in place when set! That might be great for an old antique and rarely handled mantle piece clock mechanism but not for a gun sight ... even on airguns!That all said, does 'anyone' know the mystery of the ==4== [elevation and windage] hole adjustments and what each hole is and does and where located on the dot sight? It's of course quite possible that I'm missing something here with the 4 holes thing but, hey, I'm hardly too proud not to be duly instructed by someone who knows what they are doing on this red dot sight and is willing to share the info! Thanks in advance!Doc Tony"

367253,0,"I bought these to climb and top about 15-20 trees. They work great but the spurs sit low and apply a lot of pressure to your ankle making them uncomfortable after a while. The safety belt and lanyard is ok, but only being 1 3/4"" wide cuts into your sides and it could be a little longer (it's only 7'). So short term use just up and down there great, but not so for extended use."
47912,0,"I ordered this replica to place on my desk at work, overall the quality is ok, but the field markings are a piece of paper that is glued down. I got this for around $27.00 inlcuding shipping and was excited considering other places were selling it for $100.00. I wouldn't pay over $30 for it and save up for either the platinum edition or the danbury mint version. The item is about 6"" x 6"" and about 4"" tall."

151569,1,"I bought the aquamarine super soft life vest for my 3 year old son. He has taken swim lessons, but cannot swim yet. I saw the super soft life vest on some children at a pool, I noticed the mother was able to relax while the children seemed totally confident. We were going on a boating trip with friends and all of the children needed life vests, I decided to buy the super soft vest. It is TOTALLY worth the money! My son who normally is nervous in the water felt completely confident. We stayed in the water for hours at a time, and he was completely independent (with us close by) The super soft life vest doesn't tip forward or backwards, he played with noodles and squirt guns while in the water and never flipped or rolled. I would buy this over and over again! Totally satisfied! Great product!"

260451,2,"When I 1st got them (after, all 3 lite up fine, but after about 5-10 mins the light bulb blew in 1. I had to use mine and the light bulb also blew in mine! I called Amazon about it and asked where I could buy replacement light bulbs so the Amazon Rep. gave me the Website for Trademark but it's really only for the Merchants or Companies that BUY the products from them to resale! My brother finally found some light bulbs that work, but they were a lot dimmer then the original, and as soon as I screwed them in mine and turned it on they BLEW OUT! I BLEW 3 light bulbs in a row from that pack! So I paid $13 for 2, since 3rd doesn't work!They ONLY cost me $13.32, along with the free Amazon Prime: Two-Day Shipping that I got, compared to the current price ranging from the cheapest at ""$13.69 + $4.95 shipping"", ""$18.01 w/ free shipping"", to the ""$18.95 + $10.14 shipping"", or more higher prices I see listed today (11/8/12). So I thought that the $13.32 was a good deal, but I'm going to try the Dorcy 41-1017 4 LED Mini Lantern (that sale for $26.00 on there site), but they are cheaper here at Amazon starting around $8.40 (as seen here)Dorcy 41-1017 4 LED Mini Lantern, Assorted Colors. That might be a sale price, because I do see higher prices between $16- $20 for the set of 4 Lanterns. But they do have more positive reviews, then negative ones (so after I've gotten and used them, check for my review under it)."
179615,1,"When I saw this for $40.00, I thought it was a joke. Thinking I would give it as a gag gift to a friend as a new $300.00 driver, I bought one. I received it on the day I was going out for 18 at Coral Creek Golf Club, Ewa Beach, Hawaii (P.S. If you have never golfed there, you are missing a wonderful Hawaii course.) As I was on the practice tee, I decided I would ""hit a few"" with this new ""cheapie"" driver. Wow! What a surprise. The aluminum looking and feeling face made me skeptical it would not crumple under my mighty swing (Right! All of 100 MPH swing speed.) Well, the first hit was an absolute BEAUTY. So were the next ten hits. Guess what? My friend can go find his own $300.00 driver. This one's stays in my bag replacing my Taylor R5 which I like , but began ""hooking"" too much. This new ""square head"" is just as long and ""feels"" great. The sound is kind of funny, more like a ""thaaank"" than a ""thunk"". I had previously sold a friend a Callaway Fusion driver I just didn't hit well and he saw my new ""squarehead"" and had to try it. Well, he too loved it and wanted to know the price. I told him $300.00"
433452,2,"This toy is awful. My daughter could not wait to get it and play with it. The first time we turned it on, my little dog got tangled up in the rope. It is way to fast and there is no way to turn it off without getting hit by the ball or tangled up in the rope. It is not fun and what a waste of money. I am very disapointed."

310102,2,"For the people reviewing this as a shower, it is not meant to be one. No where in the description of the product or on the box does it mention it's designed to be a shower. That's about all I can say to defend the Stansport Cabana. It's poorly made and difficult to put up for one person. The door is hard to zip close at the top because of the tension on the poles. The poles feel like they are going to break when assembling it. There are two windows at about waist level on the sides for limited ventilation and none at the top. And if you close the two windows for privacy, you'll have no ventilation. The shelter doesn't have a floor in it. That may be a plus or minus for you depending on how you are using it. We sent it back."

126815,0,"I've had my watch for one year; it replaced an Oakley D1 (my primary basis for comparison).PROs:+Large, easy-to-read dial+Great stopwatch. It allows you to stop and restart within the same lap. (Not possible with Oakley D1)+Good workout (stopwatch) memory and analysis features.+Very comfortable rubber band. The strap keeper is a good invention.+Durable watch body & face. Constructed of good materials (including mineral glass crystal).CONs:-Water leaked in and condenses on the inside of the crystal at times.-Alarm/Timer sound is VERY weak.-Does not allow simultaneous display of DAY and DATE during standard TIME function. You can choose for either DAY of the week (TUE, etc.) or MONTH and DAY (NOV 30, etc.)-It is too easy to toggle the sound/chirp on and off. I think this should be in the ADJUST mode so it is harder to change inadvertently.Overall, I think it's a good watch for ~$50."
310106,0,Ok... Do I love that it's a privacy tent for my porta potty? YES! Is it a beeatch to put together.. YES. OH.MY.GAH. The poles in my opion are really hard to work with.

32303,0,"The price of these gloves is low for a reason. The padding is VERY light. If you are looking for gloves to lift any kind of heavy weights, get the more expensive gloves with extra/gel padding or your hands will be hurting. These gloves are made for the exercise that is light on your hands. So wear them when working out your biceps or triceps, NOT your back or even chest!!! They do allow some air in so they don't get as hot as other [more padded] Harbinger models. I have them as a spare for the ""light on the hands"" workouts."

425180,0,"Let me start by saying I own Lauren Brooks' other 2 volumes of Ulitimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning (green cover and blue cover), so I'm not new to her style of instruction. Overall, I love her kettlebell workouts. However, this one seems a be a bit over the top. Many of the workouts are done with two kettlebells simultaneously. You can ""modify"" the workout to use just one kettlebell, but that kind of defeats the purpose in using this DVD (if you really want an EXTREME challenge). Also, many parts of the workout require the TRX suspension system which I don't own, and have no plans on purchasing. Had I realized how much TRX and double-bell routines were in this video, I wouldn't have ordered it. Also, my DVD skips a bit. I am considering sending it back."
230873,0,"This is a lovley sword, although it seems like it may have been a broken one that they rewelded and sold for cheaper.The guard was chipped from having been protruding from the box (but thats nobodys fault). The thin section of the flat was bent at almost a 45 degree angle (nothing my vice coulden't fix). So I took it apart and the Tang was a replacement, it looks as though the original tang had broken off and they welded a thin rusty bar in it's place, this makes the sword very dangerous to swing around. The hilt does spin so just tighten the pommel (easily, because the tang might snap off again). Because of the replacement tang the blade rocks, I stuck some cloth in there to keep it steady.So if your planning to use this sword be careful when playing with it, it's more of a 'hang on the wall' kind of sword."

342466,1,"They give me a ton of new sounds from just one calling surface and I can make it sound like their is more than just one old hen around. Which is great when I have more than one decoy out. The carbon stricker really gets out there, its raspy and loud for locating and getting a responce or pulling them out into a feild. The rose wood is great at all times with a lot of different calls and the plastic is super for light purrs and soft yelps when trying to pull them in a bit closer or getting them to move in place for that perfect shot. Havent tried them on my gless call but Im sure they will be the same!

94247,0,"This whistle is LOUD - so loud that I didn't find it very usable even in a decent-sized park in the city.I think there could be a bit more variability in the tones, and it is nearly impossible to tell which side has the ball and which doesn't - not ideal when you want to act fast. The shape of one side should be different or there should be some other way to quickly tell them apart.NOTE: The point of this whistle is NOT to stop barking - it is to signal your dog. If you want to stop barking, it should be a part of more comprehensive training. Look up books by Karen Pryor to get started."

My bike is currently locked to a bike rack 7 miles away from my house. I'm not sure what happened. This morning it locked up fine, and then when I came out to go home the lock won't turn over. I even got some wd-40 and lubricated the inside, but nothing worked.So I'm a little pissed off right now, and wanted to let people know what I experienced.Update: The next morning after lubricating the inner mechanism I got the lock to turn over. Added some more lubricant and it seems to be turning ok again. Not sure if I trust it now though.I'm giving it 3 stars since it did work perfectly for 4+ years and I'm still going to use it."

379517,2,"My expensive Spalding leather volleyball was puntured when it was hit into a thorn on a tree branch. I had hoped the ball sealant might rescue the ball. I followed instructions, and ended up injecting what should have sufficed for two balls. The air pressure held fine through the night, and during about 3-4 games of volleyball. I was delighted. But then laid the ball on the grass while we were using another ball for a couple of games. When I went to take the ball home, I found it was very soft. Pumped it up several times, but it would not hold pressure. I ended up taking the ball apart to examine the small pin hole. The sealant should have worked, but didn't. It was a waste of money, except for learning what doesn't work."

My requirements are limited - no adjustment is needed for sheet metal, automotive electronics, etc. I deeply sympathize with all the reviewers who had issues with 'truing' the compass using the internal calibration feature. I ultimately removed the magnetic compensators so I could at least get a reliable reading based on 'magnetic north'.For purposes of providing an indication of direction, standing up to salt water and not breaking the bank, it works just fine. If I was concerned about precision or durability, I'd be inclined to pay (much) more for another product."

They are plenty long enough. The slate gray looks much more dark than in the picture, which I was happy about. You can order these and be confident that they will suit your needs and that you will get an excellent value. I recommend that you order plenty of them, as I think that they are a great deal. Usually this type of shorts go for a lot more. I ordered six pairs, and I am happy that I did."

Worked most excellent, would recommend highly. Don't try to fit a pro bag though. TSA lock system worked great, they checked it both ways and actually relocked it, WOW!!!

This is useful, but the elastic is fairly thick and I found it to be really uncomfortable in my ski boot.

I had planned to give the ball to a family member, but unfortunately it is of poor quality and not burst resistant, so it will probably just get thrown out. The included pump is a piece of junk, so even if you do want to use the low quality ball, you'll need to find another way to inflate it. The best part of the kit is the DVD. Mindy Mylrea a good instructor and shows a nice variety of moves in 30 minutes. The background music could be better, but I find that to be the case in a lot of exercise videos."

484527,1,"The product was easy to put together. I wasn't able to get the padded grips on the handlebars but I also didn't try very hard because they work just fine without them. I'm 230 lbs and it feels sturdy under my weight.The electronic display is about as basic as can be: shows time, speed, calories, or distance. I would have liked to see RPM's on the display as well.The max resistance isn't all that tough but its plenty sufficient for someone like me that isn't a fitness nut.The dial for resistance seems to be sturdy but the jury is still out on how it will hold up. I've been trying interval training so I'm switching back and forth from maximum resistance to minimum resistance every minute. I feel like it might wear out or break eventually but its holding up just fine so far (~1 month).Ultimately, this bike was a GREAT value. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a casual workout at a reasonable price."

131344,0,I did buy this gun off amazon and The shipping was great and quick for super saver. The only problem with the gun is the hop up. It is way to strong. I have it turned down all the way and it still jumps up. The gun CANNOT be used at long range. It simply hops to much. I'm thinking this a just a factory defect. I have owned another one of these guns and it was perfect. I still am going to highly recommend this gun because every other feature is outstanding. The high cap clip work great and does not wobble and neithervv does the barrel. It is completly solid and not even sure I could break it. The pump is smooth and not difficult to pull. I'm still going to try and fix it myself wish me luck.

125630,0,"Okay, so three stars because I cannot fit this cage on the bike with a second cage behind it. This water bottle cage takes up all the room available for a second water bottle cage, and I have an XL comfort bike! I tried mounting on both the upright and the lower part of the triangle and could not get both cages to fit (the second cage is a standard size), so I am currently using zip-ties to help hold the cages while only using 1 screw mount point, very frustrating! I would leave just this one attached, but I cannot get the water bottle out while riding... Anyway the mount shipped quickly and was as promised. The cage itself is not perfectly symmetrical, but this does not seem to affect its performance, and the rubber piece that holds the top part of the bottle looks a bit anemic...but feels strong enough to withstand the stretch to hold the bottle in place, we shall see. I do like that the cage adjusts to the bottle. I use a water bottle for weekend bike trips, although I do bike to work (only 2.5 miles), but do not require water for the short trips."

334146,1,"I have had one of these on my key chain for over 15 years now; it's only been replaced 3 times and I use it almost daily. It comes with a removable plastic toothpick and tweezers. I love having a toothpick handy after eating out somewhere and the tweezers work very well. The tweezers do not have the strongest grip because they are very thin and therefore a bit flexible, but I have never had them fail to work and they have very sharp edges for getting out the finest hair and/or splinter.The knife and fingernail file/screwdriver are obviously useful in many instances; the only problem I've ever had is that if you are trying to remove/loosen a very tight screw it might close on you if you press too hard. The implements do not 'lock' into place, so you have to use some caution.The scissors were originally my primary reason for purchasing these and are fine enough to help trim your cuticles and strong enough for smaller cuts. They are definitely not super strong but definitely cut paper and thin plastic easily.Overall, these are a terrific gift for just about anyone and a great purchase for yourself. I've seen them in the store for upwards of $14 but you can get these for less frequently on sale at Amazon."
130985,1,I got the #4 holster in the winter time when I purchased my Ruger LCP. I love the holster when I was carrying it in my jacket pocket. It grabs the pocket well and the gun comes out of it easily. I have zero complaints when carrying it in my jacket. But know its summer time and the #4 holster I think is just too large for my jean pocket. I have tried the #2 with the Lasermax laser and did not like the tight fit of the laser.

495128,2,we were very excited to order this product for my brother in law for christmas. However when it arrived in the mail the grip ons were bright orange and had half as many spikes for gripping. we sent them back and hd to give a gift card. If we can find these I would give them next year.
298609,1,Great safe. We considered the biometric fingerprint safe and honestly this is just as fast to access. Super easy to program and when you need in it takes 2 seconds and the door literally springs open. HIGHLY recommend this safe!!

252162,0,"These shorts run ridiculously small. I triple checked the size on the tags and on the interior because I was so sure I was sent the wrong pair. Since these are so much smaller than I expected, I would definitely recommend trying these on in a store to determine size. Plus, I didn't know until too late that the seller gouges the price for shipping, in both directions, which is going to make returning them a really expensive hassle. So, be sure to review all the necessary details of the shipping policy and rates before purchasing."
63062,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed. Thank you ladies, for your review comments, as I rely on these to make my purchases."

It wasn't damaged - one day it worked and the next time I went to use it, it didn't. Am hoping for a replacement from the manufacturer but so far it's not forthcoming despite my numerous requests. Not good service."
80118,2,"I have a MPL, a gift from Ameritrade, and it worked like a champ all the way until its first refill. I used some Ronson Mult-Fill butane, available at Wal-Mart, to fill it up. It sends a flame like a blow torch, unfazed by the flame setting knob. In just a couple/few uses, it is out again. It is as though something is stuck or jammed fully open. When I checked the web site for warranty instructions, they will fix it but want you to send them a $5 check for shipping, plus pay the shipping and insurance to get it to them. That is at least another ten dollars invested in an item that costs about $25 new, right? If it is working, I give it 5 stars. However, this sinks it to 2 stars for me."
239644,1,The whole Rubber wristband thing has gotten out of hand. do your part to put it to rest by buying regular wristbands. When it was all for charities before-thats okay. but it is ridiculous now. heres the rules:-Livestrong= okay because that was the original-Everything else= NO.-People who wear like 5 of them= Probably the main reason why you'd starting wearing the regular ones.Plus they're way better and not some cheap piece of rubber that cost .2 cents to make.anyways...END THE FAD!!!!

319847,0,I bought this blade but was not clear what coat it should be used on or what effect it would give. The description is not clear and I had a hard time finding any information. Finally I found something after I had ordered the blade only to find out it was for fluffy coated dogs such as poodle and the 3F blade would have been a better choice for a dropped hair dog. I wanted to achieve the puppy cut on Shih Tzu and this was not the right blade to use for that. I wish the product description was more clear or there was a link for information prior to ordering regarding the blade recommendations for breeds of dogs and the cut desired. I think other dog owners would look into buying their own grooming tools if they had proper information on what tools will be their best choice.
71048,0,"I would love to list all the aspects that could be improved on this thing, both material quality wise and design wise, but I have to remember what I paid for it, which is sub $20.The unit is a lot smaller than it seems in the photo. I would say it is not a problem for people who are fairly accurate. But since the unit is only about 10"" wide, it would be easy for a beginner to miss it and have to fetch the ball manually.The return is not that powerful especially if you are using this over carpet. Max return is 6-7ft. It returns ONLY if you sink it. Sink or fetch.If you misjudge the power of your putt, the ball will go over the unit surprisingly easily, which forces you to fetch the ball. Experienced golfers will probably not see this as an issue.The unit feels cheap plastic."
180125,2,"Loved the size of the gazebo for the price....I saw that it had a warranty. So I purchased it. The first rain we had, which lasted about ten minutes, caused the roof to collapse in. There is a design flaw that lets rain get caught on the roof and in 10 minutes you have about 20 gallons of water on the roof that can now double as a giant bird bath.I am in the process of trying to get a refund, but other customers have posted that they are being denied the warranty.I wish I could paste the picture of the giant bird bath that I took."

I had it assembled at a local bike shop and it rides fine, but I feel like when it was assembled they didn't check its tuning because some of the gears don't engage completely. Frustrating really, but not at all schwinn's fault. I ride it still but eventually I need to get around to having it tuned to get a better ride."

A big, expensive tool should have should have smoothly contoured edges.While the scissors cut well, their shape and accessibility could be better.After spending this much, I'd like to have an awl and tweezers.I'm not certain my money was well spent. Leatherman supertool has served me well in past and might still be better. I can hope that plier pivot on this tool holds up better than Leatherman."

315220,0,"I bought these dumbbells and have used them for about 2 months now. They have many advantages, (space saving, cheaper than irons, etc. you already know.)They are nice when in good working order.The first problem I had was with the locking mechanism. One side locked up and I fixed it by taking all the weights off the base and this enabled me to dial the weight down. The second problem I had was while carrying the dumbbell across the room and the 2.5 pound weight came off. Not sure why it wasn't locked into place if it made it half-way across the basement..It landed on my toes and ever since I have been a little worried about a larger weight falling on my face. The third problem was with the dumbbell base. There is a small catch that locks in with the dumbbell gears to cause them to toggle the weight. This was not in its correct place and it took me a while to figure out I needed to pry it back up. I was only using 25 pounds prior to this problem..Kind of an annnoying problem to have in the middle of a workout. I do not drop weights or throw them around in any way either.For the price of these dumbbells I would not have expected so many problems. 3 out of 5 stars is a very generous review. Definitely have to be extra gentle with them. If I would have known about these problems before I bought them I would have considered just getting a set of iron dumbbells. Definietly not as convenient and more expensive, but obviously more reliable. Just be prepared to do some fighting with them and have a screw driver near by..."
184669,1,"These are really well made tools. Can't go wrong owning one. ""BUT"", I have a couple of ideas (FREE) to LEATHERMAN company. I hope they read this and make some changes to there tool. FIRST I THINK THAT LEATHERMAN DESIGNERS should CAST or ADD a "" NAIL "" remover on this tool. SOMETHING ABOUT 1 inch. long and curved with a V-cut ( LIKE THE END OF A HAMMER )........at the bottom outside of the main plier grippers handle. This would allow people to use the tool ""CLOSED"" and pull nails out of the wall ( hanging pictures etc. ). GREAT IDEA. It could even be it's own tool ( replace the stupid file ) in the tool itself. ...THE OTHER CHANGE ( IDEA ), is to keep all the screwdrivers and knife, and add a RACHET HEAD ADDAPTOR in the handle that folds out. ( ABOUT 2 inches long ), this would allow all 1/4 socket heads to be added...so it's like carrying wrenches around...BUT Doesn't ratchet. This RACHET connector could even be put on the tip end of the handle so it is a sturdy part of the handle ( MADE IN THE CAST AS PART OF THE HANDLE ). These would be great changes to your product...HOPE YOU LISTEN ""LEATHERMAN COMP. "". From a buyer and FAN."
368358,0,"The jacket looked great. It wasn't too fitted but it looked good on. Had room to put a sweater under. I didn't like that it made swishing sounds (like a plastic bag) when I moved, but I guess that's what you get for it being perfectly waterproof.I ended up returning it though because I happened to find the exact same style of jacket without the brand name (lightweight, 100% waterproof, fits into its own pocket) at Winners. At Winners it was on sale for $30 rather than $80. I couldn't care less for brand names so I went with the Winners one."

247280,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."

I think it looks great, is functional, and helps reduce my carbon footprint. I like the fact that it is a 1L capacity, and there are a TON of options to choose from to complement your style and lifestyle.The smaller mouthpiece is a welcome change to big, bulky nalgenes - however, it is hard to fill. I've never had this spill in my bag, so I like how I can fill it and toss it in my bag without worry. However, sometimes the seal is *too* tight - I have had trouble unscrewing the top.They say its dishwasher proof, but I just clean mine by hand. A weird thing I don't get is that it is dishwasher safe (high heat) BUT they say you can't put hot liquid in it...sounds fishy to me.I love it so much I want to get it in every color/print imaginable, but I think I'll just settle for a couple more and a few for friends and family!PROS-tons of colors/prints, sizes and tops to choose from-smaller mouthpiece design minimizes spillage-leak proof!-dishwasher proof-nontoxic and taste-free lining-one piece of aluminum means solid constructionCONS-cannot tolerate hot liquids-hard to fill-sometimes top gets stuck"

297443,0,"I found the book very inspiring so I have been trying to follow the program, but there are challenges with the way the video is produced and the complexity of the meals that have made this very difficult.I find the video difficult to follow. In terms of production and cuing, it is worse than any of the ~25 other exercise videos I've done. Specifically:-Tracy only does a few reps on one side of each exercise, so you have to stop the video during every single exercise to perform all the reps you are supposed to, and then restart the whole thing to do the other side of the body-The video quality is rather poor in general. There is no set, it almost looks like Tracy is floating in space so this can make it difficult to understand where her body is relative to the floor and therefore how I should be positioning my body during the exercise.-There is no cuing at all in the cardio part (just music, no talking). This means you have to constantly pay close attention to the screen and you have no idea what's coming next. Moves are definitely repeated, but sometimes things change unexpectedly so I have found it hard to follow the routines.Regarding the meal plan, there 4 meals a day that contain lots of fresh fruits and vegetables (and little else). I actually found the recipes to taste pretty good but it is a very time-consuming plan to follow. Some of the meals have just one or two ingredients, but others have 5 or more vegetables/fresh herbs in just one meal which is a lot to wash, peel, and cut up! Additionally some of the recipes make way more food than you are supposed to eat, like it will make about 2 quarts when you are supposed to eat 4 ounces. Tracy doesn't specify whether she means a half-cup (4 fluid ounces) or 4 ounces by weight, but either way, you have a ton of leftover food. Unless you are lucky enough to have a personal chef or are child-free and not working, I don't see how you could have time to make such complicated meals 4 times a day!Overall I found all components of the program to hard to follow. I think I could do the exercise part with a higher-quality video that had better cuing and showed all the reps, but until I have an extra 3 hours a day to prepare complicated food, I will have to give the meal plan a pass."

I felt like I had no mask on, this mask doesn't fog but it doesn't stop anything that's going to your mouth, chin or cheeks."
135750,0,"Let me start off by giving a frame of reference: I'm 43 years (God that was painful to type...), 5' 10"" and 170 lbs. I'm a pretty fit guy who's engaged in regular physical activity since high school. I've done weight training, mountain biking, yoga and several martial arts. At 35 I started training in Muay Thai, so I'm no stranger to a brutal workout routine. I'm also a proud graduate of ""P90X"". Like many others, I truly loved that program and it revolutionized the way I approach fitness. It made me a Beach Body fan for life.A few months ago, I started training in parkour and realized how ill-equipped I was for ""The Movement"". So, I turned to Beach Body and Shawn T to help me get into shape for my new hobby. For the most part...it worked. But a few things caught my attention.PROS:Insanity Delivered - I got the results I wanted. My Rest Heart Rate and waistline went down while my plyometric ability and conditioning have shot up. And though I may not have nearly the grace the parkour ""traceaurs"" do, at least I can clear most obstacles.No Additional Equipment Required - All you need for ""Insanity"" (aside from a DVD player and viewer) are some good workout clothes, your own body and some serious determination.Great Recipes - Although I didn't strictly follow the diet, I have toyed with some of the recipes in the meal book. They're pretty good tasting...AND good for you!Easy on the Eye - Each DVD features attractive, telegenic people, all of whom appear to be Fitness Professionals (trainers, dancers, runners, etc). Many even appear in other Beach Body productionsShort Workouts- During the first month of the program, the majority of the workouts will about 40 minutes long. They get to around 60 minutes during the second month.CONS:Not a Balanced Workout - As other reviewers have stated, this workout puts tremendous focus on cardio and lower body with hardly any on upper body or strength training. I've read reviews suggesting that one intersperse strength training (possibly P90X)with Insanity cardio. Not a bad thought...Extremely Hard on the Joints - Again, all the other reviews (even the five star ones) raise this point. While I didn't injure anything per se, ""Insanity"" definitely put undue strain on my knees, hips and lower back...especially during the so-called ""Recovery Week"" (more on that below). Be warned; this is a high impact set of very repetitive movements.Can Become Tedious - By the time you've reached the third week, you've pretty much seen it all. After that, it's merely different combinations of the same basic moves. After a while, it can become a bit of a grind to go through them over and over and OVER again.Not Very Inspiring - ""Insanity"" is basically a workout that nobody can do. Watching closely, I realized none of the people in the video were actually able to complete a session. Everybody, including Shawn T. himself took frequent breaks, completely lost their form or just started ""doggin' it"" (as Tony Horton would say). Okay, that's a testament to the intensity of the routine. But if even these Fitness Professionals can't get through this thing, what have I?Shawn T Didn't Really Click for Me - Maybe I miss Tony Horton's goofy, self effacing sense of humor, but I just couldn't get into Shawn T.'s style. I found him loud and a trifle annoying. He also didn't do a very good job explaining the logic or science behind his routines.""Recovery Week""??? - This workout flat out confounded me, so I welcome any insight. This so called ""Recovery Week"" consists of same workout for six straight days in a row. I fail to see the benefit of doing repetitive high stress (though low impact) movements every day without giving your muscles time to heal. By about the fourth day, my knees, hip flexors and quadriceps were so sore, I had to abandon the workout for the rest of the week.CONCLUSION:Even at moderate intensity, it's almost impossible NOT to get some sort of positive results from ""Insanity"" since you're doing cardio in six-day blocks. Going forward, I'll probably head back to the gym on strength days and mix in the ""Insanity"" DVDs on cardio days.I have to say, it did help me reach my fitness goals. But not without some lingering pains in my joints."

461325,0,"I ordered two sets of these so my boyfriend and I could play disc golf. The package was wrapped but a few of the discs looked used. One even had dirt on it. I was confused because I bought it from the Amazon Prime seller and it was listed as ""new"" condition so I expected it to actually be new. But that didn't affect the discs it was just annoying to pay that for something that appears to be used. But once my boyfriend and I took these out we had a lot of fun. These discs are a good starting point BUT if I was going to do it again I don't think I'd buy them. We both ended up buying better drivers because the ones that came in the pack weren't heavy enough for us. We both use our new driver 95% of the time and then we might pull out the putter or maybe the midrange for certain shots. Really you could spend the same amount of money on a better driver and a putter or mid range and have everything you need and it would be of better quality.

76157,1,"key lock version.I recently locked myself out of my place. I had previously put a spare house key in the ""secure it"" in my truck. I keep a spare truck key in my wallet so getting to the truck was no problem. the problem was that i did not put a spare safe key on my key ring, so instead of sitting outside in my truck for 10 hours waiting for the apartment complex folks to show up to work, or paying maybe a hundred to get into my place, i decided to break into my safe.i tried to use my leatherman to cut the cable but that did not work out well, i stripped the plastic coating and cut a few strands but not good enough. i only got halfway through the cable. i tried to turn the lock with the flathead portion of the screwdriver. i shredded the interior parts of the lock, but it would not budge. i then used my leatherman to break into the side along the seam. i used the flathead screwdriver part to pry a side open. i attacked for several minutes but the leatherman could only do but so much. however i was able to flex the metal enough to create a gap. then i got the idea to use my vehicle's crowbar. i worked for some time more. the interior side piece (a tack(?) welded piece of metal that happens to be on both sides) eventually popped loose, but remained vertical inside the safe so i could not insert the crowbar all the way across. eventually i popped the safe open and got my house keys.this all took me 45 minutes.pluses.--the lock portion held up under my attack using a flathead--the interior sidewalls prevented me from getting deeper inside with the crowbarminuses.--needs a thicker cable (i went to Lowes and made one using laminated 1/8 in cable, i think this one is 3/32nd).--needs better welding. the spot welds are weak.--the locking hasp eventually popped. i mean, it had that appearance as if a tubular piece of pottery had just broken off of a base it was attached to. needs a better weld.as a lesson, do not leave any tools in your car that will make it easier for someone to break into your safe. (yeah, a no brainer, but the crowbar part escaped me).update 10 Dec 11:there is an easier way to get a thicker cable and it just occurred to me. buy one of those laptop cable locks to substitute for the issued cable. you should still be able to run the wire thru itself and you can place the locking portion inside the box. this would be a lot easier than buying a swagging(?) tool, wire, and hoping you get it right. after all, it'd be thicker and of a desirable length where that you could still secure the cable under your seat and still bring it up to your lap to operate it.update 12 Jan 13:Airport travel.I previously mentioned how to make a shlaging(?) cable for this item and using that instead of the issued cable. i have permanently attached such a cable to my oakley backpack (through one of the metal grommets), allowing me to use my secure it when traveling through airport security. in this manner i can secure my valuables inside the safe which is basically not removable from my backpack without destroying the backpack.the point is that the screeners can always rifle through your bag and you not notice the small things missing. however, you will ALWAYS notice your bag missing, and no screener has the time, nor the tools, to cut the cable, or open your safe in the screening area to steal any high value items. furthermore, they'll always have to call you over if they want to see what's inside your safe."

34530,1,"I had my first Bullworker in the '70s -- the Bullworker 2 with green handles, two telescoping tubes, cables, and no meter. It's still with me and is still doing fine. I got one of these so that there would be more to go around in my family.This model, in effect, has three tubes: two ""handles"" and a center tube. The ""handles"" have flanges that prevent slipping when we do moves grasping the tubes.Instead of single cables on each side of the tube, this model has nylon straps that double by going around pulley mechanisms at each end. Engaging two straps at a time is equivalent to the cables of other models. But we have the option of using only one strap at a time, or one strap one side, two on the other, thus getting varied ranges of motion, as well as varied resistances. However, using one strap at a time requires adjustments so the the movement remains symmetrical. There's a tendency for the single strap pull to be unevenly distributed on the pulleys. Pulling on the nylon straps is ""less painful"" than pulling on the cables, but this may be a personal matter.There's a meter in the center tube with a plastic ring moving along it to indicate how far the tubes were moved. However, the movement of each handle is not always equal, so the reading may not be accurate. It would have been better if there were two such rings. I do not think this is significant because after a time, we don't get to bother with these ""measurements.""While the Bullworkers are known for isometric exercises, they are not limited to such. The exercise charts also show that we can adapt it for circulation exercises, endurance exercises, and so on. It's really one of the best overall exercise gadgets around and I think it should be more popular.In addition to the Bullworker 2 and this Bullworker X5, I also have theSteel Bowand theModel 28. Each would have their own features, but I would say that this X5 has the smoothest movement among the models I have, and is the most versatile (it's the only one with double nylon straps). But I would say that it would not be bad to have all these models, as I do. :)"

218224,0,"When these breeches arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the fit was pretty good. I'm only 4'11"" and the 28's weren't too long and didn't bag too much in the knees (common when you're shorter with breeches!). However, after riding in them a bit, I wish they had a bit more give in the fabric to conform to my body. Once on my horse, I had to really pull on them to adjust the legs upward for a comfortable ride. I just didn't get enough give in the crotch to make them comfy enough, though I think they fit well when standing! Perhaps I just need to break these in more, but I'll have to wait for the cool weather as the synthetic full seat is also a bit sweat inducing. Granted I rode in an indoor arena, when it was probably over 85, but I don't have as much of a pooling sweat issue in my seat when I wear a cotton breech. I think with a bit more riding time in these and cooler weather, they'll be good though. They seem extremely well made so could stand up to some washing for a more worn feel. Then, these will probably be among my favorites for cool weather riding!"

385237,0,"I take coffee to work every Monday-Friday.

A coupld of weeks later I found out that our friend had kept the thermos I returned and it never leaked on him. Unfortunately my exchange thermos leaks too, but I kept it because I kept thinking that since neither my husband or our friend has problems with leakage it must be something I was doing. As one reviewer mentioned, there is no way I can predict under what circumstances my thermos will leak. Some days it starts off perfectly dry and I think... ""ah, today it won't leak"", and then it does. Other days I don't do anything special in an attempt to keep it from leaking and it doesn't leak. It seems like there is some magic touch that my husband and our friend must have that I don't. If you are an easy-going person, this will be a great thermos for you. If you are prone to stress and anxiety, as am I, this thermos will leak like a sieve."

470251,0,"The bike is great unless you are a cold-natured person because the fan blows a lot of air while riding. Smooth operation and easy on the joints, but the seat is extremely uncomfortable. The raised areas on the seat are not easy on the bum. The pressure that the raised areas apply causes a lot of pain. They are so uncomfortable that you cannot stay on the bike for more than 15-20 without taking a break, and sometimes, it hurts so bad that you simply quit riding. It is not just me...there are three of us using the bike, and we all agree that the seat absolutely must be changed! If the seat were more comfortable, I could easily stay on this bike and ride for hours."
508927,2,"After receiving this primer tool I followed the directions for its use. It works marginally, at best. The plastic tubes that are used to hold the primers prior to seating them do not work well. The directions state that you should use a paper clip to force the last primer down the tube when if the designers would have made the lower tail on the cotter pin somewhat longer it would have made good design sense to me. Ergo, no need for a paper clip.I found out that a much older series of aluminum tubes (about 40 years old) hold the primers better, but neither the plastic tubes or the aluminum ones mesh well with the device prior to seating the primers. It is often necessary to hand seat the primers a second time in the ram as they frequently turn over when seating them in the cup. This defeats the entire purpose of using this tool and is more time consuming and troublesome than using the primer seater on my Rockchucker II or the 40+ year old original Rockchucker's primer seater accessory.The handle does supply sufficient leverage to easily seat the primer, but as it is a straight bar it is awkward to use. This could have been made with a curved handle that would have been much more ergonomic to use."
1923,1,"I bought one pair of these and one pair of Road Runner Sports Velocity compression shorts to compare for running. I thought the UA pair was going to feel very hot, as the material is thick compared to other brands (Nike, RRS, etc). These must do a great job wicking away moisture, because they felt very comfortable on a 20 mile run, and not hot like others in comparison. There is a reason you see UA products everywhere, they are really quality goods. I'll be wearing these next weekend for a marathon, if that tells you the level of confidence and comfort (no chafing with these!) I have in this product.

319132,0,"this chair does the job, but i am definitely glad i only bought 1 instead of 4 like i had originally planned. I like the fact that it has 2 cup holders, but they are very shallow and i doubt it would hold a drink if the chair got bumped. I prefer the other folding chairs that have a deeper mesh fabric cup holder. I thought about using a dremel to cut out the bottom inside the cup holders but then i realized it wouldn't be able to hold cans if i did that. However, on the plus side, i didn't have the problems some of the other reviewers had with the arms not locking and the fabric tearing. it *seems* sturdy enough, but i don't know if such is the case with someone that weighs more than 200lbs.Overall, it works for what i need it for i guess, but i am going to go to walmart or something to buy the other 3 i need, since i have seen better chairs that only cost $20-$25."

In the photo, they look like they are solid, black leggings, but upon opening the box, they are waffle-like patterned, identical to long underwear. I understand I purchased them for skiing, but thought based on the other reviews that they would be of a more versatile use (under skirts, to the gym, etc). So, I am giving them a 3 star review because it is highly unlikely that I will ever wear these pants unless they are for the pure purpose of warmth, i.e. while tail-gaiting at a football game, I will wear them under jeans, when I ski, etc. I am curious as to why no one else commented on this fact?"

450326,1,"I have been wearing compression shirts for years. Under Armour is by far the best quality. It is called compression wear for a reason. It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body. I am 5' 8"", 155 lbs. and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to. If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear. Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature. They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture. However, I think one of the best features is that since they don't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides. Compression wear was not created to look sexy. It is serious workout gear. If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help. Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts aren't girdles. They make these things in loose fit also. Not quite the same benefits, but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt. If you can wear the compression shirts get them, but expect them to be skin tight. You won't regret it."
344566,0,"I like everything about these pants except for the belt. Most football pants have the belt go all the way around the pants so you can adjust the waist easy, but these ones are stitched on.

Good quality material, but I do not thing I would ever purchase them again because of the belt issue."

They said the computer unit automatically begins working when rowing begins and offered no other assistance. Numbers do appear at times, but the information displayed is inconsistent.

303085,2,"I know I am going to get crucified for this review by all the Tony humpers, but it doesn't seem like this program is really getting fair reviews. I was only able to use the program for the first 30 day cycle, then I had to stop for a couple of reasons. First off, the workouts aren't really that great. Tony keeps saying ""this is the X people"" like it is the best workout in the world, but truthfully the only one that I found challenging was the plyometrics. I think that it was also due to the fact that I have hard floors and have had a problem with shin splints in the past. Second, the results. Oh my it was terrible. To let you know I am a 30 year old slightly overwieght female. I love my curves, but I wanted to shed the last bit of baby fat and the extra pounds from quitting smoking. All I got from 30 days were huge traps, I looked like a linebacker. Not only that but I gained 10 pounds too. All those hours of listening to Tony crow about how great he is and at the end I look like a circus freak. Have you looked at some of the womens' pictures on the beachbody website, scary huh? Third, and the biggest reason of all was Tony Horton. Yuck. All his constant babbling on and on about some stupid nonsense when he should be focused on teaching proper form, which is sadly lacking. Especially in the abs workout, talk about a pathetic lower back strainer. If you really want an abs workout that you will feel for days try thisThe Science of Fitness with Tamilee - I Want That Body!. I wish I could say great things about something I wasted so much money on, but really I can't. Sorry to all you Tony lovers, I know you will be rabbidly fanatic until the end, but I think this is a mediocre workout at best and a dangerous one at least."

205472,0,"You get what you pay for.Really cheap feeling to the pump, but it works and is very nicely portable. The gauge is kinda sketchy sometimes, doesn't always read correctly until you jiggle it or push it onto the valve more.Also the pump handle is sometimes difficult to manipulate because it has a hinge. So sweaty palms are gonna slip and snap a valve, at least I did anyway :(What I do when I start getting past ~70 PSI is press the handle against my abs, grip the metal tube, and pull my tire against my body. Seems to do the trick when trying to counter its flimsy handle. I try to do this in a secluded spot because it probably looks weird to others. But, hey, it works."
10093,0,"I have been searching for the ""best"" bore claner to remove carbon and lead deposits from stainless steel bores and revolver chambers. ""Best"" to me means complete residue removal with minimal amount of brushing & rubbing. It's like searching for the perfect car wax. All cleaners that I have tried to date fall into two classes, petroleum based or detergent based. The former are toxic (to humans & the enviroment, no doubt), have a strong odor, require ventilation and have a tendency to run all over the place. The S&W cleaner is in this category. Also, one should wear rubber gloves using this solvent. If I am outdoors, I would use this cleaner, as it is effective (I would rate it - very good, but not ""best"", in my opinion) and it dosen't leave your firearm smelling ""funny"" as some other petroleum based cleaners can do. However, for cleaning indoors in a small area, my preference is for a detergent based cleaner, which has no odor and can be cleaned up with soap & water."
26472,1,"I bought this snorkel two years ago for scuba diving in Maui as I didn't have one with me. I chose this model because I was assured by the salesperson at the dive shop that this one would not let any water in and surely enough it never did. I have used it for diving as well as snorkeling and I came to the conclusion that this is by far the best snorkel I have ever used.Unfortunately I lost it last week on another dive trip to Hawaii (on the bright side it was my 8th dive out of 8), but I'll replace it with the same exact model. Sure, it's pricey, but I think it's worth it (if you don't lose one every two years). Oceanic did an awesome job with this piece of equipment."
166688,1,I ended up buying 2 of these bags. The first I bought was for my kid's beach toys. It works very well for that. It lets the sand fall right out of the bag so we don't track it in the house or collect it in the bag. It's also big enough to hold all of his beach toys. The other bag is used for when we travel. We use it for a laundry bag. The mesh lets the dirty clothes ventilate while keeping them all in one place. This is way more organized than scattered around the room or in a pile on the floor in the closet. The bags are very well made with heavy duty stitching. I anticipate them lasting a very long time.I am sure there are hundreds more uses for these things.

161972,1,"I've been a binocular junkie for years. I've specialized in high end glasses, particularly Leitz, Swarovski and Hensoldt (when I could get them). Two years ago, in anticipation of a trip to Kenya where I would spend the days in a moving LandRover, I thought I'd try the (then new) Cannon 10x30 Image Stabilizers. I was just blown away! The optics are excellent and the weight is surprisingly light. But the image stabilizing feature is just fabulous. There is simply no wiggle when holding these binoculars (and I'm a big coffee drinker). While they won't compensate for big rolls, jumps and twists in a moving car, they eliminate all the vibration and result in much less eye fatigue. In my opinion, it's a case of technology having obsoleted a very fine product. Take my word, do not spend over $500 for fixed binoculars without first trying the image stabilized Cannons. It's a revelation."

403510,0,"I bought this case knowing that I was being cheap. I have a scoped 30-06 and a scoped 22. I want to be able to bring them both to the range in the most compact way possible. This did the trick just fine. Foam inside is very adequate at holding the rifles securely in place. The case is made from the minimal plastic necessary to get the job done. I don't think it will break or fall apart. As mentioned by other reviewers, when closing the case it is necessary to align the halves properly as the case flexes a good bit until closed. The latches that pop off rather than breaking when twisted or torqued the wrong way was a nice touch, too. Really not bad for $29.99."

138840,2,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and after putting it together it didn't work. I bought it early as a Christmas present so the warranty ran out by the time winter was over and he was ready to use it. After putting it together there was a disconnected wire in the throttle which I had to find a razor dealer to repair. Brand new, never used and already an extra $40.00 charge. After that it ran for a while and now it will not hold a charge. I read other reviews and decided I will not go through the exercise of buying a new battery which is about $90.00 without tax. I highly recommend not buying this dirt bike!!!"

436966,0,"I wear a size 4 - 6 or small in misses' clothing or a 5 - 7 or small in juniors' clothing. Because these shorts are made of a 50/50 poly-cotton jersey knit, I ordered them a size larger than I normally wear--medium--thinking that even though they initially might be a bit big, they would shrink enough to be a good fit on me. Unfortunately, the medium was far too small for me. In fact, I'd guess that the medium would be a perfect fit for someone who normally wears a small. I have reordered the shorts in a large because they are nicely made and exactly what I need. My only complaint is that the sizing seems very inaccurate. They definitely run about a size smaller than other knit shorts in the same size."

388308,1,"I always worried when I shovelled snow on inclined drive. Every time I had close calls and worked in fear. Friends told me a sprained ankle was no fun. And I knew a broken hip could permanently change lifestyle. So I bought the STABILicers Lite Ice Cleats. I have never detected any slipping while wearing them. Now I actually enjoy shoveling drive. When I obtain drinking water from spring I wear rubber boots. There was always danger of slipping on the moss covered rocks. Now no danger with STABILicers on boots. I feel as secure as a mountain goat. They have never slipped off shoe or boot. They are a tight fit over shoe and a very tight fit over boot. That makes it aggravating to put on. When visiting friend with no chair on porch, it was very difficult to put them on while standing on one foot. At least I didn't worry I'd break my neck while climbing their ice covered steps and porch. I have not needed to wear them over two hours. After an hour they become uncomfortable because the heel cleats are forward of my heel. I learned to minimize this by positioning them on heel first and then stretching the toe straps over toe. Most of the stretching will then occur from ball of foot area to toe area, instead of heel area. As I gained confidence walking and working on snow, ice, mossy rocks, I became almost reckless. It's exhilarating to feel secure with STABILicers. Bargain price too."
335794,1,"This belt is everything I had hoped it would be. It is well made and should last a lifetime. Also I was wondering if it would stay tight and not loosen. Thankfully, It stays right in place. Massey Outfitters shipped it promptly. I recommend both them and the belt."
294076,0,"As mentioned by some other reviewers, this item does not work with any of the Garmin units with an SD slot. Other than that...it's exactly what I was looking for. I made modifications on my own so that the back cover would work, but that eliminated any seal that might have been present."
166757,0,"First of all it was not wooden handle but aluminum one which we expected.... Also it was not that easy to assemble it. The legs were so stiff. Maybe it is because legs has to be stable and durable but that is pretty much work to do.Well, not only negative points. it is light weight and folded in very compact. Easy to carry and store. Oh, it was good deal too."
494734,0,"I am still fairly conflicted about this product. On the one hand, the unit feels cheap and clunky. The buttons are awful and difficult to press without completely unseating the computer from its mount or pressing an unwanted button in the process, and the interface is one of the most poorly designed and difficult to use things I have ever seen. The most useful information is relegated to the smallest part of the screen, and you've got to cycle between a huge number of screens to view information. It requires something like 10 clicks for me to reset the computer to target power over an interval and have my wattage displayed again.On the plus side, the power numbers are repeatable and there is simply no cheaper way to train with power. This alone makes the product worth all of it's faults.I should note that the waterproofing of the computer is terrible due to a terrible design decision requiring a connection between the computer and the quick release mount because for some reason the wire leads to the sensors come out of the mount instead of directly from the computer. As a result the computer would frequently cease recording data when it got sweat on it (I have it mounted on aero bars and I'm a heavy sweater). After a period of cursing and considering returning the computer entirely I decided to rubber band a sheet of plastic wrap over the top. The screen is still legible, it never drops out anymore, and as a fringe benefit the small amount of compression from the plastic makes the terrible buttons considerably easier to press. Without the plastic wrap, this would be a 1 star functionally unsuable product and I would have had to return it.Overall If you've got the extra cash, and a smartphone the new Kinetic inRide computer might be the way to go. For $200 you get wireless functionality, your phone for a display and the ability to save and upload workout files. I'll probably stick it out with this computer through this offseason and hopefully upgrade to a real power meter."

317936,1,I love this watch - it looks absolutely fantastic. The only problem that i have with it is that it scratches very easily. I had scratch marks on my watch the first day i wore it from my work desk. I have been wearing Seiko for over 3 years now and couldnt find a single scratch on that watch.
461985,1,Bought this in conjunction with the Leather Cleaner and it has brought back to life the Leather in my King Ranch pickup. Also use on my boots to keep the leather supple and in good shape for a long life.
307794,0,was hoping for something a little better like other mesh shirts as the material here is more like polyester or spandex.. but it does the job and fit well.
359586,2,Very poorly constructed. While the vehicle was parked it came off the window and bounced to the floor. Two parts of the plastic broke rendering it completely useless.
454473,0,Product is definitely not user friendly. Operating instructions are not very useful I will not recommend this product to anybody. When it functions I have reasons to believe that its readings are not very accurate.

Only downside would also be that it is quite small that it can be a little difficult to lock your bike from the some part of the frame of your bike to the low bike racks most places have.. so i have to use this U Lock plus a cable lock in combination, if I plan on being at the place I'm in for a while.."

56870,0,"As the title says, these are a pretty decent alternative to wraps. The biggest plus is that they are super easy to take on and off -- you don't have to spend your time wrapping. However, I found that with constant use (I used them 3x a week) they start to fray pretty badly. I also found that they retain sweat and the ""glove smell"" more than wraps.So I now use them in rotation with Everlast Professional wraps, and it seems to work fine. (Or, you could just buy three or four pairs of the Gel Wraps, but that adds up.)And this may or may not be important to you (it's wasn't to me) but you will definitely get some looks at the gym, since these are not the traditional or ""old-school"" wraps. You might not get taken as seriously.In terms of care, I hand washed them in Woolite and warm water, and they usually needed a day to dry out.In terms of support/protection/cushioning, I did not notice any significant difference between the Gel Wraps and the traditional Pro Wraps."
303706,0,"The P90X workout is awesome. I am just completing Block 1 (first 4 weeks) and I am following the program to the letter. Unfortunately, one of the DVDs in the set called Yoga X and I haven't been able to do it because the DVD would not play. I contacted customer service and after a delay, they sent me a Yoga DVD from some other exercise program NOT P90X. I have been substituting the Yoga day with another Yoga DVD I already had and I supposedly have one on the way but the program is pretty expensive and I would think they would do quality checks on their DVDs to ensure they play. In any event, my clothes are falling off me (only 20 more lbs to go) and I continue to wait for my P90X Yoga X DVD in the mail. Hopefully this time they sent the right one."
153939,1,I gave the waist pack 5 stars because it was very hard to find one that fit my daughter's 24 inch waist. This one was adjustible enough to go down that low. It was also more reasonably priced than many of the other waist packs I saw. I would recommend it to anyone with a very small waist. My daughter hasn't been using it long enough to test it's durability but it seems very strong.

472057,2,"When I first got this product I was happy how light it was and its visibility. However, when I tried to actually wear it for the first time, the side of the sunglasses fell apart and I cannot reassemble it back to its original state, because the sides were made out of plastic and looks like it will snap apart if I forced it back. This may be one out of 100 pair that happened to be defected...but I would appreciate if I can get a refund or a replacement for the defected product that I bought :("
309379,2,I bought a New York Met cap from this vendor and it arrived on time but the washed look made it to worn looking and the size I normally wear is Med to Large and this hat I ordered was a large but it was so tight it felt like a small. Wound up giving it to my nephew to wear and no but I wouldn't buy again.
166566,1,Fantastic product. Cheaper price than in the retail stores and no tax or shipping fees. Just can't beat that. Hoody is very warm and comfortable. Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep warm and comfortable.
74875,2,The Frisbee did not survive the first outing. We felt it was a total ripoff and were disappointed by the no return policy.
146302,0,"The product works alright. I would have liked to see a better quality hardware included; I ended up using a good quality deck screw instead. I don't see how you could fit two bikes on here. I have one bike with a rounded frame that does not fit well on here, so pay attention to how similar your bike frame is to the one in the pictures. I've decided not to use this as long term storage as the bike is just too awkward on it, and instead just use it for repairs when I need to. I use standard hooks and a ceiling mount bike hoist as my long term storage instead."
43117,0,"I purchased the Japanese auto, coin bezel version a couple years ago. I really researched this company and read the reviews, etc. I was skeptical but went for it.The bottom line is I don't wear it. It is heavy which is of course obvious, and owning ""Tags"" in the past, you do get use to this. But my main gripe is it is a bit PAINFUL to wear. The edges are fairly sharp, and really dig into my wrist. In fact I would say it hurts to wear it. I will sometimes wear it ""out"", but take it off and hand it to my wife to put in her purse. Maybe they could have spent just a little extra time on the design and rolled the edges, or something.Now it looks really nice just like the Rolex. In fact from a few feet most people, including me, could not tell the difference. I could see why Rolex had an issue with this watch and the coin bezel.As far as the time keeping goes. I really don't know about how accurate it is. First off I don't really care about that feature since I kinda tend to use my phone these days for that. Second I don't wear it long enough to know how well it keeps time. Third for $90.00 or so bucks I paid I don't expect precision.One more thing. I believe the blue gold finish is a bit too soft on the bezel. I had it for a couple of days and got a BIG scratch on it. I swear I did not do anything abusive to it, in fact I was babying it since it was my new baby. ??Looks good, but feels terrible! And I guess you get what you pay for.Hope this helps."

The colors are pretty much accurate to the pictures.The material is thin, but I prefer something light-weight for working out. The elastic band doesn't bother me at all.I will say they are SHORT and SMALL. I generally wear a small and I ordered large for these (though a medium probably would have worked too). And they are very short - as in ""be careful when you're stretching"" short. I tend to wear them around the house all the time though since they're super comfortable."

335958,1,"Purchased the product based on the excellent consumer reports review. I selected the free shipping...no problems as noted in other reviews, other than the dispatcher had Los Angeles instead of Los Alamitos for the destination. Also, the dispatcher said the delivery would be between 1 and 5 pm...the crew called at 9:00 am and asked if they could deliver early. Word of warning...this thing is very heavy and hard to handle. If you can, have the shipping crew move it it final destination. Also, (I'm speaking from a bad experience) don't remove the shipping strap around the belt until you have the unit where you want it. I found out the hard way that when you put the treadmill on its side, the dang thing folds up...the strap prevents this."
461644,2,"When our parents were visiting us for an extended period of time, I decided to get this cot for daily use for some months. After using it every night for one week, the cot remained firm but at the end of the second week it started sagging - my weight is around 72 kgs. Also, I had to lay on my back or else my hands would go numb from sleeping on my sides. Your body remains in a C shaped posture when you sleep on this cot. At the end of third week I started getting back and neck pain. I returned it back.This cot is meant for outdoor use and that implies using it once in a while (?). If you would use this once in a while, probably you'll like it."
505061,0,"What I like most about this little stopwatch is the large display. As a baby-boomer who now uses reading glasses for fine print, it's refreshing to find an electronic device that can be read without glasses, so kudos to the manufacturer for that. I wish the makers of cell phones would follow suit.Reservations would be two things: the stopwatch comes with no directions. This may seem trivial, but I was confused because my old digital stopwatch had a separate timer for hours, minutes, and seconds, while this one has a clock that appears to be the same thing. So naturally, I couldn't figure out how to ""start"" this hour-minute-seconds timer. Turns out, however, that it is merely a clock--which is (a) an relatively unnecessary function for a stopwatch, after all, and (b) its presence precludes the ability to have the more utilitarian second-level hour-minute-second timer, which I found to be extremely useful in my work as a forensic expert.I discovered this, only by going to the manufacturer's website and downloading a PDF instruction sheet which, frankly, should have been included in the package. Nevertheless, if you just need a simple stopwatch to time laps or something, you can't beat the price."

Also, only has hex wrenches, one torx and one phillips; I don't like going out without box wrenches. On the plus side, its so small, its like carrying nothing at all, and you usually don't need more."
398261,0,"I bought the rotary steering as a replacement for an old Teleflex rack and pinion system that went bad. The rotary system has more resistance in the cable and drum and is called ""no feedback"" because of this increased resistance. You will not feel the motor twisting against your hand like the rack and pinion system did ... the down side is ... it is stiffer to turn and ... there is no feedback from the motor. With the rotary NFB system, you will no longer be able to grab the motor and turn it and the steering system if you want to adjust or straighten the motor while it is sitting on the trailer at home.The standard steering wheel for this system is 13"" instead of the 14"" size Teleflex used on the rack and pinion set ups. With the increased resistance, I wish I had looked around for a 14"" instead of using the standard 13"" wheel. You will probably pay more, but it will be easier to use."
435984,0,"Ordered this item to use as a game at a festival-type fundraiser. Due to the noise level at the event, we could not hear what comments the automated announcer made when the ball was hit, but the kids enjoyed whacking the tethered balls nonetheless. Once we got the item in a quieter location, we verified that the announcer oftentimes said nothing at all, and the only way to get the thing to work was to THROW the ball at the mat, (and then it only worked in the middle sections.) Assembly is a little tedious, and some of the instructions are rather vague, which resulted in one elbow-piece being inadvertently broken in the process. This game LOOKS really cool, but is only worth the super-low price I luckily purchased it for...not the $[...] it normally goes for."
135766,0,"Although this workout program is very intense, I feel it is too intense for anyone trying to lose weight to be able to do the right way. The workouts they do are so hard that I probably am only able to do 75% of the video. I am finished with the first month, and I have not lost any weight. However, I have gained muscle mass. My legs especially are a lot more toned than they used to be, and my arms as well. My stomach has shrunk a bit, but again I have not lost any weight on the scale. I am hoping that is because I have lost weight but gained muscle, so it has evened out?? We will see how month two goes. Also, very repetitive. The moves in the videos are basically the same. It is the same warm up every day done three times in a row. It makes the whole program seem more tedious than it actually is."
260329,0,"I picked up one of these specifically to convert it to LED. Construction is light weight, but they hold up fine if you don't abuse them. Out of the box it works ok, puts out a decent amount of light although it drains the batteries fairly quickly. I found it to be a great platform in which to install a Cree LED pumping a Chromalit remote phosphor. Nice light, 10+ hour battery life and it's a compact, light weight lantern. As a platform for a fun DIY conversion, it was a cheap starting point with a nice end result."

398237,1,"The Guidecraft Red Sox toy chest is a great addition to a Red Sox themed baby room. It is a solid, well crafted piece of furniture that weighs nearly 50 pounds when fully assembled. The assembly instructions (no text - just 4 labeled pictures) are mediocre at best, not unlike many products whose instructions are designed overseas. One full set of screws (labeled as part ""M"" in the instructions) were completely missing but inexpensively purchased at any hardware store. All pieces are painted with a high gloss enamel acrylic and look very professional, though I'm sure that this is a typical assembly-line product. I shopped around and found Amazon's price (with free shipping) to be the least expensive anywhere on the web and dramatically less expensive than the 3 nearby retails stores. A similar, but much less durable Guidecraft product, is available at Baby's R Us; that product is incredibly flimsy, so make sure you buy this one and not the cheaper product (I wonder why Guidecraft even makes the cheaper version - it's terrible).The Red Sox haven't lost a single game since the day this product arrived by FedEx... and the Yankees haven't WON a game since that day so, for you Red Sox fans, this is apparently a GREAT way to subliminally support the Sox!"
465206,2,"I got this hatchet at a department store for about 35 bucks. It came with a little holster and a dull edge. I put an edge on it in less than 2 minutes as the steel just grinds away (too easily). I go take it out and chop a small dead tree about 8 inches in diameter. I swung a couple times and the little saw came out half-way while I was swinging and got a good nick on my hand. I set the saw aside and finished the tree in about 4 minutes (very light hatchet takes much more effort). After the tree was down I examined the head and noticed there were some ugly nicks on the blade. It took a file and 10 minutes to straiten it out. I was not happy with how badly the hatchet was damaged from an old rotten mesquite tree. The saw that comes with it is really sharp and works well on branches under 3 inches. The handle is a little small but this is a compact hatchet it fits into. I would buy just the saw and a sheath but not the hatchet. It's not worth the little weight it is to go in my bug out bag. I advise that people go with a heavier constructed hatchet such as the Estwing hatchet or cold steel trench hawk. It's worth the extra weight by far. This hatchet just not gonna cut it when put to real use. I do not trust this hatchet to get me firewood long-term.I end this review with a bandaged hand, a near useless hatchet, an ok saw with no sheath other than the crappy hatchet, and 35.00 bucks lighter wallet. Do not purchase this hatchet! Go with something heavier! Also buy through amazon so you have the option to return the item."
273492,0,"I wear glasses so OTG google were important. I saw these and the features and price looked good, so I took the plunge. I wore these about 10 times total. The good features are that the tint works well for various condtions. The polarized lens help with glare. They don't fog up very easily. The major problem with these is the size of the googles. They say they are helmet compatible, but they really aren't. The frame is so tall that a helmet will push the googles down on your face and possible over your nose. I tried adjusting my helmet and the googles and the two would not work together. In case it matters, I am using a Giro Sestriers helmet. I have since bought some Oakley's that work fine with my helmet. The lens on the Oakley is not as nice, but they fit better and are more comfortable."

However, the edges of the fabric rubbed big sores into his chest. I ordered the medium and sized it appropriately to him, nice and tight so that is didn't have room to chafe. Poor guy had big sores on his chest for a week after one use :( My dog does have a relatively short hair coat, so maybe on a longer haired dog it wouldn't be a problem. I gave it to a friend who has a wire haired pointing griffon and she loves it, so it might have just not been the right fit for my dog."

467741,0,"This product arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect condition. It was also as described. Unfortunately, for my use, it is simply too small. The handles are only 1"" around (my mistake for not reading the add closer) and the space between the two handle grips seem very small to me. Perhaps it is because I have not used one of these in a while, but I recall the handles being larger and farther apart on the ones I used in the gym. Overall, I would not buy this product again. Not because it is not well made--it is exactly as described and appears well made. Rather, my personal preference would be for a device that is simply larger so I can get my elbows back farther when doing sitting rows. The price of shipping was a bit ridiculous as well but again, my fault for not paying more attention."

Soon as I get the refund then I can say excellent.
270191,0,"The watch itself, as far as functionality, was everything I wanted - lap counting, stopwatch, etc. However, the strap style is a bad idea for a sports watch. The watch part is suspended between the two resin straps, and as a result, they break and come off rather quickly. There is no secure joint between the strap and the watch face.I loved my watch, and was very sad when it broke. I had a fast strap style before and it worked much better.I ran with this watch frequently, showered in it some, swam in it, etc. The face did not fog on me. I felt it stood up well to running, button pushing, etc.The strap is the main issue, and the reason I won't buy it again."

340721,0,"This pedometer works well and appears to be accurate. Unfortunately, the plastic clip that clips to a pocket or belt has a tendency to break after about a month (it happened to both pedometers I bought), and it is very weak. In addition, the bracket holding the pedometer itself broke on one of the two pedometers within 3 months, so be prepared to carry the pedometer in your pocket, at which point it is inconsistent in measuring your steps.I do not see any clips or fasteners for sale that might remedy this situation. If you have spare metal clips from business conferences, you might be able to fasten this to the pedometer. Otherwise, be prepared to buy a new Omron pedometer every few months, or else buy another pedometer."

417526,0,"Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase. I love being able to push the toy when needed. I am, however, a little disappointed that the seat and/or pedals do not adjust for my child's shorter legs. The seat moves forward and backward, but it does not move far enough up for my son to keep his feet on the pedals. My son still loves the toy though. I also wish there was a way to lock the handle bars in a straight position, so the toy would be easier to push (without a rider to steer) when we're out somewhere and my son decides he wants to walk. We haven't had this toy for very long yet, but it seems quite durable and easy to clean. I would recommend this toy."

155082,0,"We ordered the Diadora 4 seat bench for our soccer team so the kids might be more comfortable during inclement weather. The unit comes in a carrying bag that has wheels for easy transport, and shoulder straps for carrying it on your back. The bench features a removable cover with side panels to keep off rain and sun. Set up was rather easy and the kids seemed to like the comfort of having shelter.Our main problem with the bench was that they kept arriving broken. The first one had some broken plastic tabs that kept the unit from being assembled properly. The parts were riveted so they could not be replaced. We returned it and the second one also arrived with some broken plastic parts along with broken wheel parts on the carrying case. We did attempt to use it and found that if we could get our hands on an unbroken one, it would be a fine product!I would have easily given the Diadora bench 4 or 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that they kept arriving broken. This could have been the fault of the shippers. Amazon ""requested"" we not order another one until they could investigate the problem, but we feel they just got tired of shipping them to us. That said, we currently do not own one of these benches, but do plan on buying another one in the near future.UPDATE - Ordered a third bench, and once again it was broken. This time I contacted the manufacturer. They are aware of the problem and were surprised that a defective one was still on the market. They stated they have fixed the problem so it should not be an issue in the future. This company went way out of their way to make sure we were satisified and I would not hesitate to do business with them in the future."
368725,0,"Because of the **weak cage**, I am downgrading the rating for this derailleur from 5 to 3 stars - see the update towards the end.This derailleur started out working much much better than my previous Shimano XT. Both derailleurs were equipped with long cages and I had a chance to compare the operation when each worked with a new shifter.For the sake of having my own selection of gears, I put together cassettes out of individual cogs. With this, the profiled teeth of the cogs do not always line up and the quality of shifting leans heavier on the derailleur. After recent changes to my cassette, I found that I could not get anymore satisfactory shifting with my Shimano XT derailleur. No matter what tension in the cable I used, shifting between some cogs was problematic, if not impossible. I changed to a new shifter and started out experimenting with spacings between the cogs. The shifting improved a bit, but problems remained. In desperation, after reading literature, I tried Sram X.9 and all my problems disappeared in a blink. In fact, I did not need to vary the spacers, just sticking to the standard for 9-speed. I could go up and down in gears and gears change without hesitation. As an added bonus, X.9 allowed me to cross gears, i.e. I could shift to the combination of the largest ring in the front and the largest or next largest cog in the rear. Riding in this manner is not recommended, but it is good to have it as an option when needing to react quickly. Shimano XT rattled, producing a noise that suggested an imminent breakdown of the drivetrain, when I was on the third largest cog in the combination with the largest ring. Sram allowed to use the largest cog in nearly as eventless manner as the small ones.In the past, I was hesitant to get locked in the length of cable pull for Sram, but it appears to be a superior technical solution. Besides length of cable pull, the shift quality for X.9 might be boosted by the lack of play in the top pulley of the derailleur.**UPDATE (Feb '11): With changing conditions during winter, I often change the tires. After 7 weeks with X.9 on, I found that I could not start the bike upon changing the rear tire. An inspection revealed that a flange of the inner cage of X.9 was bent by 90 degrees towards the wheel. With the flange bent, the cage could not hold the chain.The immediate reason for the bent cage was that I apparently had not fully dropped the chain into the derailleur when putting the rear wheel back on. The chain grabbed the side of the flange and bent it to the verge of breaking.The issue is that I must have misplaced the chain tens of times with Shimano XT or, for that matter, any other derailleur I dealt with, and I have never incurred this kind of penalty as with X.9. **For me it is unacceptable to be in a situation where a rudimentary moment of inattention in wheel installation, where no strong forces are involved, completely and nearly irreversibly immobilizes the bike.** With the amount of work I put into bikes, I can rather safely broadly state that I lack any other comparably fragile components on any of 7+ bikes under my care. In examining the X.9's inner cage I found it to be out of aluminum that went down in thickness to 1.45mm in the region of the flange that bent with ease. By comparison, the inner cage of my Shimano XT, also out of alu, never goes down below 2.30mm in thickness. Interestingly the outer cages of both X.9 and XT are both of alu of about 3.40mm thickness. The dangerous reduction in the thickness of the X.9 cage, over a limited area of that cage, does virtually nothing to the overall mass of that derailleur, while making the derailleur susceptible to easy damage.With the revealed weakness of the X.9 cage, **I cannot really recommend this derailleur**. To gain a good shifting an option might be to go with the lower X.7 derailleur that has a steel inner cage. Unfortunately, it is not possible to buy an inner cage separately for X.7 and use it to replace the one in X.9. Another option apparently might be to use a Shimano derailleur and replace the upper pulley with an aftermarket one, to eliminate play in that pulley. Myself I cut out a sturdier replacement inner cage for X.9 out of stainless steel sheet, but this is not an option for most people.As further comments, hoping to get an X.7 cage out of this and, otherwise, testing the company, I pursued a warranty claim with SRAM, but my claim was denied. SRAM dealer made comments that ""the damage did not occur while riding"" and ""I cannot prove that the damage was due to a flaw in the material"". Indeed it is hard to push the blame for poor design decisions onto the fluctuations in quality of the material. Overall, even though the derailleur equipped with my own inner cage works fine, I doubt that I would have bought it, if I knew of the level of anxiety awaiting me down the line."

One day while at my desk I put on 4000 steps!! The direction book doesn't have any info on how to change this so, I don't really have an accurate account of my steps. If your goal is to get in 10,000 steps a day, this isn't really the tool to use because of its sensitivity. If you're only using it during your workout, it's a good tool."

The felt was a little thin, which meant the creases were somewhat more 'set' in it, but my major gripe is that there were permanent black marks on the felt in a couple places on one side. They could be grease or oil or ink from some phase of construction, not sure.Luckily I was using it for the other side, but if you are taking the trouble to buy a gaming felt for a project or event, you are doing it to give that additional level of polished appearance and having a stained felt is unacceptable."

I like the Kryptonite I used to have much better. The old Kryptonite locks used to be prone to theft because thieves figured out how to pick the locks with the body of a ballpoint pen (thats the model I had... hence the replacement) but the new ones are pretty much foolproof.

DE, or Double Eagle is a cheap company, so don't expect too much. My estimate is it shoots at about 200 fps. It feels like maybe 650 RPM, which is poor. As an AEG, the battery is of poor quality. The battery life isn't too bad. The body is of cheap plastic being held together by screws. All of the attachments are useless. I expected this though. The laser was not included, the scope is a plastic non-zoom scope, the flashlight made of extremely cheap plastic and poor quality. I can expect newer airsoft players to be looking at this gun, and i understand that. So my 3 star rating is for newer airsoft players. This is a good starter gun, and if you're looking for a cheap quality airsoft AEG for a reasonable price, this will safice. If you're looking for a long term airsoft AEG, look towards Full metal AEG's like an M4. Also, check out [...].

The pockets on the sides are very handy for phones, torches etc.- We had rain (& heavy sometimes) during the night, but the rainfly kept all the water off the tent, not a spot on it when we packed it up except for the lower sides.

It was late April and not quite warm enough to really warm the water without the help of the sun. We have a lot of shade around here but we managed to move the packs to keep them in the sun. The directions were not easy to understand and we had a really hard time figuring out how the nozzle worked. They still leaked some when we put them in the sun, but no rips in the seams and it really did make life a little better while we were without hot water.HOWEVER, the SMELL of the item infuses the water. You get that plastic/PVC smell and therefore, it will transfer onto the skin.

279352,0,"This is a very comfortable air bed, no doubt about it. I use it about once a month while visiting my mother and lay it out on the floor in the den. Air beds are cold, even in summer. I have to put an electric blanket under the sheets.I have the same issue with it as other reviewers have found. After about 4 uses it started losing air from the intake/output valve. I wake up 3 or 4 times during the night, reach over the edge to push the air pump button to get it back up. It's annoying. It's a nicely made mattress, certainly more comfortable than a sofa bed, but you'd think they would find a solution to the air loss problem. I've been dealing with this for 2 years now and am in the market for a new one because I'd like to get a full night's sleep."
249047,2,"Like other people, I also had the enamel chip on the plates. Also two of the bowls got stuck to gether and when I pried them apart, the enamal chipped again. Can not use the set threw it away."

200362,0,This lock is just OK...the cable is thin and could easily be cut and the lock mechanism could easily be broken. This will deter someone from running off with your bike BUT will NOT stop a thief. On the upside...it is easy to set the combo to the numbers of your choice.
212012,2,"The pan arrived with a crack that runs through the metal from exterior to interior. It doesn't seem to leak, though, and it's great otherwise."
336131,0,"These are okay shorts. If you plan to work out all the time in them, I would reconsider. They don't have a drawstring so I wonder how long the elastic will last for frequent washing. They fit fine however and don't show through."
150979,1,"I always feel naked without a watch around my left wrist. Casio has solved that problem at least, and it does so with a certain style unique to my taste. The features aren't complicated, and I do find them pretty useful. It's a good watch to have."
116239,2,"the only metal on it id the guard,blade, and sheath capping. the blade isn't even false sharpened. i would suggest the knights ornamental dress dagger."
263726,1,"I am highly impressed with the quality of this flag. The colors are bright and unlike some other yard flags, this one is a substantial size that is well seen by those passing by."
36787,2,"Although the size given on the halter was ""Pony"", this halter is far too large for my 36"" mini. I was very disappointed. To return costs $7.00 which is actually very reasonable, but the two halters I purchased only cost $8.00. So they will go into the yard sale I suppose."
251601,0,"Its an inexpensive, comfortable, but cheaply made tank top. Great for workouts with it's heavy duty cloth. If you are looking for a cheap workout shirt, get it."
51051,1,The shorts arrived prompty and as described. They are great for my daughter to wear under her lacrosse skirt.
99693,0,"I have ridden this bike for more than a year. It was my primary car. It has not fallen apart as some have said it would. It is also not the fastest ride on the block. I commute 5 miles daily and a longer 13 mile ride about once a week. It is good in that it is a bicycle that works. The main problems I have encountered are, where to mount the lights, (grip shifters sit in the exact spot that the headlight should), and how do you attach a cargo rack? The ring that tightens down the seat post is the only place to attach the rack, which makes it extreemely dificult to tighten the seat post. Also, the allen bolts used to tighten the seat post are fairly soft. I would prefer other shifters so that I have the bar space to work with for lights and a speedometer. As it is I have an extension bar attached to the headset for my peripherals. I have saved enough in gas that it has paid for itself already. Please note that part of the problems with this bike stem from the use of non standard parts. Because the seat post and down tube are so large, I cannot put on a quick release ring. Because the Aero rims are drilled for Schraeder valves, it is very difficult to replace the tubes. (if there is one thing you will need to replace on any bike, it is the tubes)Also, you will need to replace the brake pads as soon as you can."
246245,1,"This seems like a good quality product, although I have only had it a few weeks. I needed it for a costume and now am just going to use it to work in. It didn't shrink or bleed in the wash and the sizing was accurate."
237709,0,"The tackle box itself is pretty good, but the description states ""Make their first fishing trips more fun and hitch-free with everything they need in this one neat package... our price is easy to catch, too! Includes Beginner tackle assortment; Drawtite latch; Tongue-and-groove construction is water resistant; Hooks, floats, sinkers, stringer, hook disgorger; Tip-Guard tray supports; Removable dividers""The tackle box contained a small bag with a few hooks and two floats, nothing else. If I had known that I would have bought something else. I bought two and now have to stock them.I called Flambeau and spoke with customer relations. The box no longer comes with the items listed. I explained that several websites had this listing and it was misleading. They offered to send me more hooks and two more floats and said I should take this up with Amazon, they could not be help responsible for what was on websites.I called Amazon and they offered me a refund and said they would correct the website. Box is good, but not happy about the misleading info on product description. If you want a good box that you stock yourself this is the one, but if you are looking for everything you need as the add states this is not the one you want."
34870,2,"I have owned these for just under six months. In that time I have replaced the batteries six times. The POWER ON LED's have never worked. The left muff now has a noticable static/crackle when active. I agree with the ill concieved battery placement. If I had known about the battery situation from the beginning, I never would have bought them. You have to remove the ear cushion to get to the battery. Because of the tight fit, you have to push against the electronics to get enough purchase to pop them off. A small notch on the outside so a screw driver would have helped.That all said, the low profile is the main reason I purchased these muffs and they deliver in that regard. They do not interfere with my rifle stock."

181628,0,"I use the larger caliber BoreSnake product for my M44 Nagant and Kar98, and it works fantastic. Only thing it didn't have was that cotton bush at the end for putting solvent on it for cleaning. I could never find one that did - all the shows I went to had the BoreSnake without that bush on the end of it.So when I saw this product, I jumped on it - this is the one I've been looking for!Of course, when I got it, I was dismayed to see that it was the exact same 10-15$ product I could buy at any local gun store, with no cotton bush at the end. Its just a standard boresnake, as pictured, but without that nice little cotton bush at the end.I double checked the product description - nothing in there about the picture not being the same as the product. And that is honestly disappointing. I expected what I saw in the picture, and since the description didn't give me anything to contradict this, thats what I was thinking of when I opened the package.I feel a bit ripped off - I could have saved myself 6$ shipping by just heading down to the local Big 5 and picking this up for about 12$. Nothing I can do about it - the product works as it needs to, and it still takes solvent, so I have no complaint about usability. I just wish that I knew what I was buying before I did it."

168172,0,I bought this bike hoist and found out it would not work out for my walls. I was able to give it to a colleague who could use it in her garage.
312458,0,"Quality is OK, price is OK, but the time piece does not keep the time so sharp...it is always behind about five minutes every month or so...and the date is never centered with the window. My two cents."
482202,1,"This is one of the most useful devices I have purchased for aiding my close-up photography. I use it to scan a close up scene and pick out objects or features that I want to photograph. It works exactly as advertized. This means that it can be used to view objects from much closer than is possible with conventional binoculars. Of course, it also doubles as the latter, too. Strongly recommended."
250551,0,I bought this light for commuting and to be seen. I am pleased how well motorists see me night or day raining or not. I did not expect it to illuminate the road although it does... barely. The light it self is great for it's intended purpose.The mount is really poor. It constantly slips on the handle bar of my road and mt. bike.
461993,2,"I'd avoid this product for now. I've gone through two of these in the last year. I love the idea and the ease with which you can slide it on and off, but therin lies the problem. The saddle attachment mechanism is made of very thin, weak plastic. I've had two bags break in exactly the same manner: the thin plastic on the locking mechanism attached to the bag breaks, the bag falls off the fixer attached to the saddle rail, and dangles precariously by the velco strap that wraps around the seat post, bouncing off your rear wheel. NOT what you want to have happen on a screaming descent in the Italian Alps, as happened to me.This bag may be fine for those who ride couple hundred miles a year on smooth pavement (good luck finding it). But for serious bikers who have to contend with the rough and tumble of pot-holed roads, as we have in New England, try something else.I do love the bag, but will not be buying a third one unless Topeak does some R&D; and strengthens the attachment."
432123,0,Great for layering due to its thinness. I was expecting this to have a little more substance being a Marmot product. Overall you get what you pay for.
473266,0,I purchasaed thirty Titleist Pro V1 AAA Recycled golf balls. About twenty were clean unmarked balls.Ten had logos and other marks on them. These are good practice balls.
24669,1,I work with this almost everyday. It is well made and is large enough for a tall man (6'2).
310979,1,"This shade is well worth the price. We braved the beach with a 108F heat index and the kids loved it. It's a nice escape from the sun and large enough for four (two adults and two kids.) My only difficulty was trying to set it up in a moderate wind. Once up, the supplied sand bags and stakes kept it up all day long."
427772,0,"I like the lotion. I have never used her lotion before so wasn't sure how it would smell and/or feel. I like the way it feels, but it has kind of a ""soapy"" smell to me. It goes away after a little while, but the initial smell is a little stronger than I like. I like the way the perfume smells better."
111047,2,"The Bushnell Sentry 12-36 scope provides fair views at 12x in good light, but at higher power the eye relief diminishes rapidly and it becomes unusable to someone wearing glasses and difficult to use without glasses. I was looking for an easy to carry alternate for my 82mm Kowa scope. I intended to use it on a gunstock mount or monopod to get quick views of birds that were too far for my 10x binoculars. I did not find it suitable for this purpose. It comes with a very practical ""scope glove"", a soft case, and a hard case worthy of a much better instrument. Perhaps Bushnell would have a better product if they had omitted the hard case and spent the money to provide better optics."
505289,0,"I bought this for my wife and it was missing the resistant band. I contacted the seller and never heard back from them. Also the audio feature on the discs, that let you turn the music louder, did not work. Not sure if this seller is selling defected copies of Turbo Fire because we also found typing errors in the accompanying booklet."
382860,2,"After just one use, I loved this bike. Since I'm somewhat out of shape, having the ability to ride the bike allows me to extend my workout and keep my heart rate up for longer than I could with just a straight elliptical. However, after about 2 months of use, the washers between the bars securing the handles to the foot pedals broke off and now the entire machine creaks and wobbles, especially at high speeds. Thinking that I just needed to replace the washers, I've been on a month long search of every hardware store in my city that has been in vain. I've not yet been able to find washers even close to what I need. Even searching online has yet yielded results. I love the machine and think it was somewhat worth the money I spent, but having this little detail go wrong and prove unsolvable is totally disappointing."
242296,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."
495679,0,not bad but this had to be my second since its only one. yah only one not a pair but its my fault not looking at the reviews so i would say that this truck is awesome but that i had to 2 of the different colors white and red

305553,0,"The mask and purge valve worked fine, but the strap broke on both masks I bought within 2 days of use. Had to replace with silicone straps. Good for one season I suspect and snorkling only."
339154,0,"This device is very sensitive and sometime gives faulty readings. It is okay when you're walking continuously for long distances, but it sometime gives exaggerated readings for short, interrupted movements. For example, I picked up the pedometer and clipped it to my belt, moving it from a horizontal to a vertical position, and it went from 0 to 10 steps. I suppose you just have to monitor the display and take extra steps to compensate for the erroneous reading. It does have two good features in that it maintains seven days of readings and it automatically resets to 0 at midnight."
151910,2,Put 2 of these on my truck. Doesn't cam enough. You will have to spin it every time to get the fork on and off. Waste of money. regret the purchase. Ended up just laying bikes in the bed. Could be good but needs improvement.
357325,2,this is junk............. the handles wont close together and it is cheaply made and the sack to hold it is way to big so it moves all over in you pack and to return it I had to pay postage.

413957,0,I ORDERED THESE IN PINK AS PART OF MY SISTER'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT. OTHER ONLINE REVIEWS SAID THEY RAN SMALL SO I ORDERED A MEDIUM FOR MY SISTER WHO USUALLY WEARS A SIZE 7 SHOE. THEY'RE WAY TOO BIG - I WISHED I HAD ORDERED A SMALL. THEY WORK JUST FINE BUT DON'T FIT SNUG AT ALL. SHE LOOKS LIKE A CLOWN WHEN SHE PUTS THESE BIG PINK MONSTERS ON HER FEET TO GO POTTY.
97328,2,"I purchased a white one and it looked great.However, the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and isn't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing. It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It's a nice brand, not worth the price and there are better ones out there."
167210,2,"I bought this with the intention to use it at a rock climbing gym, however, upon getting it, i noticed that there is no belay loop.

490243,1,"Wow! What a scope for the price. Great eye relief and clarity. I mounted this scope on my Savage 22-250 and added a 40mm 4"" sun-shade. I sighted in at 200 yds and was on center with 4 shots. I use this scope mainly for hunting predators and love the BDC reticle. Using Hornady 55-grain V-Max bullets and my handloads, the reticle compensations match identically out to 600+ yards perfectly. My longest shot taken successfully was 658 yds on a ""yote"" and the POI was within 1""+/- of where I ""guest-i-mated"" the hold-over. I can't say enough about this scope. It equally compares to my Leupold VX-III in clarity, has quicker sight acquisition than the VX-III, and provides the same or better clarity in low light such as dawn and dusk hunting situations. If this scope is this great, I can only image what their ""Monarch"" series scopes are like. Wish the ProStaff came with options such as turrets and a mil-dot reticle [for them even LONGER shots]! Amazon price can't be beat plus the added bonus of FREE super-saver shipping!"

318053,2,"A big disappointment for the price. The machine has plenty of speed, but no consistancy with the pitch. It may throw a perfect pitch one time and the next throw one at your feet or way over your head. The only thing that it is good for is outfield practice, but for the price who would want it just for that?"
11467,0,"It will be ok, but I was expecting something of a heavier weight. I bought the same vest about 5 years ago and it was a heavier weight. It made it easier to get into. This one is very light and more trouble to get into."

I bought a classic SD and loved it, but it didn't have enough tools for me, I wanted the mini champ because it has a phillips screwdriver, and a ball point pen, not to mention all the other handy items.For me this one is perfect! Size- 2"" long, and just under 1/2"" wide, fits very comfortably in my pocket, and I barely notice it. BTW, Amazon price is 1/2 of retail, I checked!"

426529,1,"Seems like a sturdy enough and comfortable to wear backpack for traveling (not backpacking). I plan on taking it to europe so will see how it performs. The interior is just as deep/wide as my luggage on rollers but I think this will be better for going off and on trains etc. My only concern is safety - hoping it will be theft resistant as well although it is not like pac safe bag. Osprey seems like a well made product overall.August 2012 Update: I took this moderately sized backpack through 4 countries, on trains and planes in overhead and it worked fantastic! It was the perfect size for everthing I needed (except for carrying all the knickknacks I bought which had to be shipped home). But if you are looking for a sturdy traveling backpack, definitely consider this one. In terms of safety, I found a way to use a lock on it so that no one could open it up while on my back (because the zippers are not lock proof). It worked great. And the times when I was waiting around, I just kept my back and backpack toward/against a wall. Can't wait to use again on my next trip!"
305725,0,"These balls are normal run of the mill balls. I used to like them a lot, but after playing more tournaments and USTA leagues, I found all of our matches used the Wilson US Open balls which are substantially heavier. Now, if I play with these regular Wilson balls, they tend to fly too much if you use an aggressive swing. For players who are out for a casual match I would highly recommend them, but otherwise I would buy one of the more expensive, heavier duty balls. By the way, much better price at Target."

I'm size 8, medium, 5'4"", 130 lbs and the medium fits perfect. The sleeves are a little long - but that's better than too short - am I right about that - especially if you are an active person?

54895,0,When I opened up the box for this helmet I was very surprised by how large it is! I was pretty disappointed by the size because it really looks pretty ridiculous on my kids' heads (though I would never tell them that). I give it three stars because it definitely seems rugged and durable. Just be aware that if you are buying this for a preschooler they might have balance issues because their heads are now the size of a beach ball!

469628,2,"This is a piece of crap. In retrospect, I'm surprised it didn't shatter into a million, irretrievable pieces while releasing of puff of haunting laughter from a Fiskars executive as soon as I opened the packaging. I don't know where this was made, but I imagine that the problem was that the 8 year old sweat shop worker's tears kept dripping off of her cheeks and screwing up her weld surface. This is outrageous, Fiskars, as I fully expect you to force your child laborers to weld while wearing sweat bands and facemasks."
382590,1,I love Kathy Smiths walk cd's. They keep me on track and enjoying my walks. She keeps me energized and her walking tips help so much. I urge anyone to get these to start a walking program. So far I have 3 cd's. I am getting more to keep it all fresh and fun by rotating them.

It is very difficult to keep clean and if you have a clear bite value others can see the build up of scum in the bottle, yuck! There is just too many pieces to have things go wrong with. The bite value if you are not very carefully when cleanly can tear. Also don't leave this water bottle in your car. If you do you will have water spilled in your car. As the water or liquid heats up in the straw it forces its way out through the bite valve and will leave you a mess. It is also is prone to leaking as we found out when we bought the smaller version for our 2 year old. Don't waste your money."

445222,0,"I bought this umbrella after my previous one was destroyed in high winds. For about a year, the umbrella worked very well. However, the plastic cap at the top of the umbrella eventually broke, followed by the thin, wooden handle, causing the button to continually pop out. I never had any issues with the spines, or plastic tips, but having a broken handle sealed the deal for me, and I ended up purchasing a different brand. If they re-engineered this umbrella to use better quality parts - even a plastic/rubber handle - I'd probably give it another shot."
36108,0,"Wanted a trailer that we could afford now rather than save up for (such as the Burley). So I got this online after reading the reviews. Unfortunately, it's not working out for us. The trailer is great. Easy to put together and take apart to put in an SUV. However, our 3 yr old daughter and 1 yr old son don't tolerate touching each other for more than a minute, so everytime I've used it, there's been fighting. Our son won't even get in it anymore. So, either I have to wait and try again in 6 mos. or sell it and wait to buy a different one. They tried the Burley at the store and both seemed to have plenty of space and a better separation of their sitting places. Oh well. My mistake, not the product's. Though I still can't rate it better than a 3 because if it had more separate seats, it would be better. You get what you pay for, right? (A friend has this and her girls sit in it rather nicely.)"

However, these were replaced by the 2.0 sport cap version, which has been TERRIFIC so far! The sport cap 2.0 does ""whistle"" when you drink out of it. It's the sound of air moving through the little rubber aerator. It's not a nuisance to us though. The other caps don't have this. We love that they are stainless steel (not aluminum) and the plastic caps are BPA free. We take ours to work, to the gym, in the car and our children use their's all the time. An environmentally friendly and healthy way to encourage hydration!"
41164,1,"Who really cares if it smells like chemicals/paint? Why does it matter? In short if you store these in garage it doesn't and then they are a 5 star product. They are large with well marked out and unique scoring, they show shots fairly well with everything I have shot at them (AR,9mm,45,40,12ga). The personal photos represent how large they are, almost as large as the ""green"" and huge 10 packs you can get at walmart. The paper is thin but not so thin that it rips in the wind, and they are packaged in a great box,rolled up, to transport them. They might be a little much for a busy public range if you are not comfortable at shooting realistic looking targets, but why else are you there if not to practice."

313947,0,"These are very comfortable gi pants. They are a good heavy weight, but soft cotton, not the heavy canvas type, flexible and easy to move in. I've had several different gi pants, and these are, by far my favorite. They are elastic waistband, rather than drawstring, but I prefer that. And as a female martial artist it can be difficult finding gi pants that fit well, but these are definitely the best I've worn.Update to this review: I had decided to purchase another pair of gi pants and ordered these again since I liked them so much the first time. Unfortunately, the gi pants that arrived this time were nothing like the first. The previous pants were brushed cotton, elastic waist. The pants I received the second time were the heavy canvas type material, drawstring waist, and had the ProForce label on the front, exactly what I did not want. I'm guessing the description is intentionally confusing because the pants come from different vendors and Tiger Claw has no idea what may really be shipping? At least I was able to return them without difficulty and was able to find another pair of gi pants elsewhere that fit perfectly. Just be aware when ordering the gi pants may be different than what you expect."

The butt side of the gun case doesn't stay closed, always has a 1/2 inch gap. Tried putting my ammo case on it to sqeeze it closed, still has a gap. As I said hard case is a hard case, I'm not planning to fly with this case, just going to the shooting range & hunting."
19917,0,"I bought this handguard after admiring the Galil for some time. The price was reasonable and Tapco was a trustworthy brand for me so I took a shot. The instructions for installation are rather sparse, I had to look up more detailed instructions on youtube. Once installed the hand guard looked and felt great but the top cover would not snap on! After some research it looks like some amount of ""modification"" is common to get this thing to fit. After about an hour of dremel work the top cover snapped in, not perfect but it's in there. Overall the grip feels better than the original wood but installation could be more seamless."
81328,1,"I like these slacks. Similar to, and nearly as good as, the now discontinuedColumbia Men's Lander Pant. I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting, but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way. Also, now the velcro on, and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out. But, everything else seems the same. I still love these pants, just a little bit less now though."

189895,0,"We bought this for our 10-year old daughter for Christmas (2008). The pros are that it is gas powered, and for the price, it's pretty good. It also has headlights and blinkers, which makes it safer at night. Since it's for a 10-year old girl, it's not being used for anything but on pavement and sidewalks. She is happy with it. I wouldn't recommend for anyone wanting to off-road. There are really no shocks and it rattles like crazy when I have tried to take it around our house on the grass. The trunk rattled so much that we took it off. As far as quality, not so much. The electric start has never worked. My husband took it apart to see if he could fix it (he couldn't). When he was done, he remarked that he was surprised it ran at all, as poor as the quality was. Also, the handle bars don't fold down like X-treme claims. Perhaps an earlier version did, and that would explain why the manual that came with it was for a model (not ours) that did fold down. If your needs are simple, like riding on pavement, I would recommend this product. It's not too terribly loud. I've asked my neighbors if they can hear us riding around outside, and they all say no. We live on a cul-de-sac with .25 acre lots. This product is fun, and I plan to buy one for me so I can ride with my daughter, but all in all, I am left a little disappointed with it too."

255209,0,"I bought the skidless mat, since I was bound for a summer Yoga-Retreat on Crete (Greece). I imagined to sweat a lot and from my experience sticky mats then tend to become not so sticky anymore.I found the skidless mat OK, however not great. When you are not part yet part of more flexible Yogi-family, it's probably more a product to look forward to using once you are more ""pretzel""-person, since otherwise you might get frustrated of what this mat is offering you.My teacher I made this mat a gift, loves it. She definitely is Pretzel-Woman. So, decide for yourself. Hope this helps.Now one week later... I feel like adding to my prior statement. I kind of like this mat, even so I'm still not-Pretzel-Man.

197808,1,Delivered quickly and in great packaging. The jersey is just beautyful. Once you have it in your hands youll understand this is something to wear on gameday only. Not an everyday piece.

151705,0,"Some versions of this bottle have an all-plastic cap, some are half metal. Since you can't tell, you should ask the seller if the cap is partly plastic attached to a metal stopper. Either way, it seals with an o-ring.Pro:-Metal design won't leech chemicals and won't absorb odors or stain like plastic-Cap seals very tight with a quarter twist-Cap is weighted/designed in such a way so that when it is removed and sitting on a flat surface, the cap will lie at a 45-degree angle so that all surfaces that might make contact with your liquid won't touch the ground-Beefy loop on cap great for a cord for carrying or for a name tag-Very light and compact-Wide mouth for easy cleaning or adding ice cubes-Skinny, fits in my car's drink holder fine (2005 Toyota Camry)Con:-Cap crossthreads pretty easily so take your time (no damage, just gets stuck)-Appears to be single wall construction, so not a good insulator and sweats condensation-Lip is rolled/formed, will hold moisture after cleaning and is a possible bacteria source-Also this ""hollow lip"" holds water, tends to drip on you-No way to attach lid to canister-Very tall, limits placement in the refrigerator-Can't see in (obviously) so you have to pick it up to tell how much is there, or open it to see what's in it-For plastic cap versions, the cap is hard to clean by hand... the threads have some weird geometry that make it very hard to get into all the corners-Also, for all plastic cap versions, please note that ours tends to take on water when diswashered...Neutral:-Unlike plastic it will dent, however won't crack either hence the neutralBottom line: despite cons, recommended."

They love their dogs and can now take them hiking and be ready with the water bowl when the dogs need a break! The water bowl is sturdy and flexible."
85399,0,"I take about one 3 week packpack trip a year. I recently used this for a 3 week stint in SE Asia. It was actually a little bigger than I'd like but it was rather inexpensive for the type of backpack so I gave it a try. Unless you are going to a cold place, you shouldn't need more than 55L. My friend bought the Teton 55L off Amazon and I rather liked it, so I'm buying that one next. I was going to originally get that but Amazon's prices seem to change quite a bit on these backpacks. One week it was $49, next $79, next $69.PROS:-It's big. I went there using only about 60% of the capacity. I ended up buying a lot more stuff than I usually do just because I knew I had the space.-The materials are very good quality. For the price, I was very surprised. I'd guess it would be around $100-$150 if I saw it in the store for the first time.-Sleeping bag compartment, pretty easy access.CONS:-It's HEAVY. I would put it at 6 pounds empty. I was rather irritated when I picked it up. It's the heaviest backpack I've ever picked up.-The design is really poor. The number of straps and plastic snaps is beyond insane. Not only that, most of the straps are over twice the length you need it to be, even for a large person. There are several I had no clue what they did, like the bottom ones. There are both loops and straps on the bottom of it for an unknown reason. This all adds a ton of weight. In fact, I spent about 3 hours clipping off all the straps and buckles I didn't need or figure out what the purpose was. I also removed the huge, oversized hip pads/straps. I then used industrial glue to redo the straps. I removed nearly 3 pounds from it.-The 10+ refers to the top being used as a hip bag, there's a rather large, heavy buckle in the top part that you use to strap around your waist. Not only is it awkward to wear, it's the dorkiest looking thing. I'd put it on par with duct-tape and a large zip-lock freezer baggie.-Water bottle holders are too short, my water kept falling out. I ended up just carrying it in my hand.-The rain cover in the top is pointless to me. more weight I got rid of. It'd help if you are in a downpour but who treks when it's raining that heavy. Maybe if you're in the woods and can't get decent shelter...or you want to use it to make a temp shelter... For light rain, the material is semi-water resistant. I just sprayed some water-proofer on it before I left and voila, zero weight water resistant.-The side pockets are useless. I like the ones that actually are compartments. These are just folds that expand out. I could only stick a couple folded shirts in them.-Material is high quality, however it's also very heavy again adding to the weight-The top is only held on by plastic buckles, the kind that easily come un-done when check-in'd at the airport. I used metals clasps to secure them for flight. If they come undone, I could easily imagine your contents being dumped all over the tarmac.-The main compartment's height/width ratio is not good. It's basically a long slender tube. It'd be better to have the widget and depth increased and have it a few inches shorter like most others.-The main straps that go over the shoulder, which supports the entire bag are nearly ripped apart and I didn't have much weight in it. It can easily be fixed with 'gorilla glue' which I used on other parts as well. There's only a line of stitching on each strap supporting the entire weight. For the most critical, stressed stitch...spend the extra penny to make it more secure.SUMMARY:Good for the price. I might suggest it if you are mountain backpacking and are more interested in getting something decent for a cheap price but for backpack traveling, there are a lot better options, even in the $50-$100 range."
289947,1,"I just love everything about this jacket so much that I'm going to order another one in a different colour. The grape is beautiful, but it is so distinctive people can pick me out of a crowd. I've been wearing it solidly since I bought it and I just can't bear to go without it long enough to wash it!The jacket has quite a sleek fit, so although it is clearly an out-doorsy sort of jacket I don't feel silly wearing it over work gear on the way to the office. It also looks great with a pair of running tights - and is so breathable that it FEELS great to run in as well.I live in Wellington, New Zealand, which doesn't get that cold in winter but is infamous for its natural and man-made wind-tunnels, and its biting windchill. This keeps me warm and dry in horizontal rain!This jacket with a couple of merino tops it is all I'll need for the winter - and it's far more flattering than the giant down jackets everyone else is using to keep the wind out this season!"

143549,2,"Coleman used to make decent mattresses. The first one I bought lasted me about three years of fairly frequent use. However, in the last couple of years I've had no less than 8 of these mattresses go bad in less than a month. One of those lasted exactly 3 days. The only reason I keep getting them is due to the generous return policy of certain merchants, and the personal satisfaction I get from making a company such as Coleman take a loss on the returns for a poor quality product that shouldn't be on the market in the first place..I've determined that the problem is poor quality of the seal around the inflation area. Do doubt that they cut down on the amount of sealant applied to save a few cents per unit. You can fix it with a whole lot of duct tape, but that means you have to pull off the duct tape to reinflate the mattress 1-2 times a weeks, and plaster over the hole with a lot duct tape again. You shouldn't have to do this.Note to Coleman: have your Chinese factories use about 2 cents more of epoxy per unit around the inflator area, and you'll cut way, way down on your returns, and probably cut down the loss on customers due to dissatisfied buyers switching to other brands."

467137,0,I find this product to be disappointing and somewhat unstable. The first time I used the cart it toppled over taking me with it. Fortunately I was not seriously injured.

417267,0,"I purchased the previous version of the Rock, Roll &amp; Ride for my eldest son when he was two. The idea is great -- anyone with at least one kid knows that multitasking toys are a wonderful idea. However, as a tricycle, this does have a few flaws.The biggest flaw we found is with the plastic &quot;tires.&quot; They look cute, but are really slippery, so they don't grip the ground well. My son had a really hard time learning to pedal because he'd get the movements right, but the trike wouldn't go anywhere... he just literally spun his wheels. Then, my husband wrapped rubber bands around the tires to help them get some traction, and that helped Jake long enough to get the hang of it. Also, if you use this outside, the tires get pretty scraped up, so you might not want to bring it back indoors where it could scratch your floors.Another flaw was the short push handle, but according to the specs for this model they have lengthened the pushbar, which can only be good. I'm 5'6&quot; and I thought it was too short for me before.Lastly, I think this item has a short life span for your child. Jake turned three years old at the end of January, and he's really outgrown it in terms of what the trike can do. The ride just isn't smooth enough to justify him using for real &quot;bike riding.&quot;I've read a lot about trikes tipping, and if I think about it, this does tip, but not all that often, so that's a good feature.Finally, I guess this is a good recommendation as an indoor toy. For a longer-lasting outdoor toy, I'd try one of the Kettlers."

After that I made sure that I scrambled the combination every time I put the lock back on my bicycle. Turns out that's not good enough. I had it locked and stored on my bicycle, and the U fell off again a few months later. I never found it again, and I know you cannot trust a lock that unlocks solely with vibrations.

The neoprene gasket is more comfortable on my deep-set eyes than newer silicone gaskets. The fogging doesn't bother me--I'm used to it and as another reviewer said, I keep a drop of water in the lens by long habit. Unfortunately the Sprints I've purchased over the past 1-2 years have had a quality problem with the gasket--they've started separating after only 1-3 months of limited use--my most recent pair also developed a tear after 2 months. I will probably continue to purchase them because I haven't yet found another model that I'm as comfortable with, but I know what I'm getting myself in to. If you want a reliable pair of goggles that will stand up to some use, I don't recommend getting the Speedo Sprint until Speedo renews the quality."

363210,1,"Love this watch a lot. Not too big, and certainly not too small. Love the black mother of pearl dial set off by the diamond markers. This watch is understated enough, yet because of the polished stainless steel bracelet and diamond markers, it looks more expensive than it really is. It's a ""diver"" style watch but elegant looking enough to wear with your career outfits and dresses, yet sporty enough to wear casually. Bulova has some very unique styles, and this is one of them. Runs great too! Bought it 3 years ago (November 2007) and I haven't yet had to change the battery (it is now December 2010)!"

The shut off valve is the little yellow thing, and just acts as a lock to prevent water from coming out. I can't really see why that is necessary since the regularPlatypus Drinking Tubeworks just fine and I didn't really have a problem with water leaking out of it. Unless you're using your reservoir as a shower or something, this is a waste of money. I didn't notice any unusual taste either."

You will receive two padded handle push-up bars and off the first glance I thought they looked sturdy and reliable, but once my boyfriend tried them out clearly they weren't what I thought. He had a hard time keeping the bars still as they were too light and his wrists seemed to move around more than we would like. The more he used it the less sliding they were doing, but overall it didn't look like he was getting the full effect of the push up. Being this light makes it easier to hurt your wrists and especially if you're a heavier person."

444249,2,"The good news is that the product kept the flies off my horse. The bad news is within two days of putting the drops on her she developed a reaction to the PERMETHRIN in it. She was lethargic, had a raised tempature, developed hives, and was not her self. She spent a lot of time on the ground trying to get comfortable. She showed obvious signs of discomfort. She aslso was off her feed. When I felt her mouth she had hives all in side her mouth. When we called Equi-spot they said to wash it off of her immediately and that they had heard of this happening before. We had her hospitalized and the vet gave her antiobiotics to fight the fever, and the lumps. She is doing much better now and hardly has any lumps. Still this was very severe. A lot of horses don't react this way to the pemethrine (my other horse did not) but this fly medicine has a high dosage of the pemethrin in it and my horses reaction was very severe. I would not recommend using this product without looking into alternative options."

201746,0,"I bought the entire 90X and + series the summer of 2008 thru Beachbody.com website. I really like the entire series as a whole, but the + workouts are shorter and not as intense as the original P90X series. While most of the P90X workouts were about 50 to 60 minutes long, these workouts are shorter and not as challenging.The Total Body Plus workout is about 43 minutes long with over 10 minutes of warmup and cooldown. So you have about 28 minutes of training and breaks included. This is a all in 1 total body workout: abs, shoulders, back, legs, and chest. Tony takes you through all the routines, and drives you crazy constantly repeating ""This ain't no dance routine, this is P90X+!"" This is a shorter but challenging workout that works the entire body. Tony introduces new moves and variations of pushups and pullups, that made me think I hadn't done that before. You have a variety of routines that both need and don't need weights. I especially like the 2 minute pushup, pullup combos that you do twice during the workout. It's a good change up to your routine, and very good for men and women who want a short and moderately intense workout.I gave it only 3 stars, because it doesn't pack the punch of the original workouts. I only do it about once every two weeks now to change things a bit. On the other hand, my wife likes it very much and does it about twice a week. As I stated earlier, the Plus series production value and the workouts aren't as good as the P90x series. I personally like the harder and longer routines, but this ideal for someone wanting a total body workout in less than 40 minutes. All in all, this is a good workout but just a bit too short for myself."

483015,0,"On the night of the first camping trip, we woke when the dog was barking at critters scurrying in the night. (This happens every time we go camping, who can blame him?). In the morning, we awoke to a two inch tear in the screen.We inspected the screen material of my children's tent (Coleman Sundome 7x7 - a $50 tent, and our friends REI Hobitat - a $300). The mesh on both these tents seem to be much more durable - slightly thicker and a diagonal weave pattern. Our delicate Columbia tent couldn't handle it, whereas our previous Wentzel never had a tear. We are not talking about a wild and crazy dog - he probably just pawed at the window as a racoon went by. I suspect he's done this many times before in our old tent.Be warned - the screen material is not very strong. If you don't take the dog camping, it might not be an issue. Now I just have to figure out how to repair the hole."
35320,0,"I have used this mini trampoline before and wanted to get this as a gift for my active 11 year old son. Upon opening the box on Xmas Day, we realized one of the legs was missing the bracket for the support arm. Odd because the legs come already attached and you just have to move them into place. I would imagine that means even if the company sent me an extra leg with the correct bracket, I would have a tough time attaching it. On the other hand, the company has not answered my email sent on Xmas Day so I am still waiting a reply. I realize its the holidays but today is January 2nd and there is still no answer. I will give it til next week, assuming it will be business as usual in the first full week. Also wish the cushion around the edge was thicker. It is fairly skimpy and my cheaper mini tramp had a better buffer around the edge. Will keep you posted to see if the company rectifies the problem with the bracket."

I lift 5 day a week just to give you an idea of how much use is put into them. Everytime time that I lift the dumbells they rub my finger raw and dry that my skin starts to crack now. Not a very comfortable feeling afterwards at all. I think that it is a good product but I just have a problem with the fabric around the fingers etc. I think that they could improve on that area, which would make this product superb."

87058,0,"I bought two. They are roundish heavy balls.Each has two decals on it. One has the numerical weight, and the other says ""Made in China."" How do they decide where to put the stickers? Same way they do it for peaches. Put the sticker over the bad spot. One ball had its numerical weight sticker over the rough spot where they cut off a plug or the casting sprue. It will need the attention of a file. The other ball had its ""Made in China"" sticker over a sharp edged casting void that I will fill with epoxy so I don't cut my hand on it.That gray color isn't iron. It's gray paint. Really low quality gray paint. The balls were a little bit dirty, and I wiped them off with denatured alcohol, figuring that would take the dirt and grease off. It also makes the paint gummy and causes it to flake and peel. I may just strip off the original paint and re-coat them with Rustoleum. I'm a little worried how bad they will look under the original paint.Overall, they are definitely cheap. You are not going wrong by too much if you paid only $15 a piece for them.

138800,0,"I bought this for my small 11 yr. old son for Christmas. assembling it wasn't bad although 1 of the allen wrenches was a little small and rounded. My son loves it, and I love the fact I don't have to buy gas and oil for it, and it's quiet. So far the battery has been holding up very well, and the motor has adequate power for average size kids. My biggest concern is with the rear wheels one way drive. It uses a freewheel that is a slightly modified bicycle freewheel. The 3rd time my son (who weights 65 lbs.) rode it the rear wheel started making a clicking noise. The 4th time he was going up a hill and all of a sudden he gave it throtle and it wouldn't go. I called Razor to get a replacement part. They said it needed a new rear wheel assemble and they were on back order and it would be 6-8 weeks before I would recieve it. I recieved it in 6 weeks and so far so good, but he has only riden it a couple of times (because of winter weather) and now it's out of warrenty (90 days). What makes me think this freewheel will hold up any better than the last. I truly think Razor delays the replacement part to better their chances to get beyond the warrenty period. One other thing that's not even close is that they recomend this for 14 yr. olds and over? Most 14 yr. olds would hit there knees on the handle bars and look like the were riding a tricycle. I think they make this recomendation because the bike is very heavy and if it tips over on a younger child they could get a leg and hip hurt pretty bad. If the new freewheel holds out I think it's a good alternative to a noisy, lawn distructive gas motorcycle?"

325692,1,"I bought a WeeRide after being disappointed with the Burley Trailer. The trailer quality was fine, but for anything buy pavement riding, it spray's debris into the seat compartment. My daughter was covered in dirt, sand, etc. This was not fun for the canal path her in Ohio.What I love most about the Wee Ride is the experience. The seat lets me be my daughter's tour guide to the world. We have great little conversations about seeing bunnies, birds, joggers. I get to point things out to her and she responds. It is great. With the trailer, I felt we just brought here along for the ride and she wasn't really thrilled.As far as the product goes, it's well built and sturdy. My knees DO NOT bump into the bottom of it. I'm not sure why that happens to others. It might be the type of bike you have. There is some adjustment possible. I have a large hybrid bike (Trek 7.2). There needs to be a little room on the neck of the bike right below the handle bars, beneath the headset, to secure the WeeRide. I don't think it would work on my wife's bike for that reason, who has more of a mountain bike. The harness is a little basic, but I feel much safer with her between my arms than in the back or in a trailer. Also, the balance and control of the bike is unaffected. Rear mounted seats can't claim that. My only complaint is that I wish it had a little cup holder for the rider.Overall, I'm very happy with the product. I haven't used the trailer since. My daughter loves going for rides with me and it truly is quality time for just me and her."

Will let it air out overnight. If it is still there will be returning it..although I do not want to...it is nice..of adequate size and well built. However, I cannot keep it if this cheap paint (prob from China) makes me ill. Three stars because of odor...would like to give ot five, though.Update:Okay three days later....completed assembly and left window open all weekend the smell is almost gone and I am looking forward to using this unit..quality product. I really would have prefered to paint this thing myself than to purchase a product with toxic paint. Otherwise it really would have deserved five stars.Update 7.25.11 three weeks later....have to send back. Fumes from paint causes my lips and face to burn. Must be a very toxic finishing material. Since this unit is in a room that I will be excersizing in not safe long term. Sad...because I really liked it."
428119,1,"Ive had these riding gloves for about a month now, and I've been satisfied with them. They're comfortable, a good fit, and really add that extra layer of padding for my hands. Well worth it for the price. The only thing I'm not too big a fan of is that they don't have very good ventilation."

68245,0,"I bought this program from BeachBody.com hoping to have a good start before buying P90x. This was disappointing... The videos are so boring and so old fashion that you think you're back in the 80's, however, I liked the resistance bands and the information that comes with it. I feel that this company is so greedy and cheap that they don't worry to update their videos, they only want your money.The progress bar that you see on the videos is the only cool thing I could see, but the music, the background and everything else looks hideous, the videos are so old that they look blurry in your TV.The workouts are OK, but I prefer something that makes me sweat more... I've used the Jillian Michaels videos and also Hip hop abs with Shaun T and those are great workouts, you feel that you're rally exercising, but this is simply BORING... I recommend to invest your money in something else..."
37371,0,"Bought it in October, mostly for the compass. Once I put it in the middle of the windshield, the compass now works fine. The altimeter is kind of a joke - it recommends that you reset it each day. The barometer is amusing. The ""atomic"" clock did not automatically do the daylight savings time switch.Note: Today, 11/5/07, my Wayfinder tells me the date is 10/36. :)As of now the atomic clock always resets the clock to Mountain Standard Time - I live in Central and it's now daylight time. It does not deserve the three stars I gave it."

356804,1,This unit is well made and it will make your life a whole lot easier. The only problem you will find is with the initial setup of the speaker wire which is a little awkward.
463534,1,"Just great. This little pump works really well and inflates quickly. Like 30 seconds quickly. Also it fits on the stem well and is durable. I haven't mounted it on my bike yet, since it will most likely get stolen, but to throw it in a backpack it works great also. Definitely get something like this if you have presta valves! I hate the adapters. This thing is great."

79188,0,"I bought these for my labrador retriever to play catch in the backyard. He loves to chase balls and chew on them. These balls didn't last 5 minutes and he had already broken the ball and had most of the yellow outer covering torn off. I then went to Target and bought the Wilson balls, 3 for $[...] and they lasted for 3 weeks before he broke them. Maybe we got a bad batch, but I'll be going to Target to get him balls there. Much cheaper and sturdier for him."
258677,1,"I have couple revolvers that use .38 special ammo and this is a good tool to have if you have a revolver that takes .38 special rounds. This is a 6 round speedloader, and I repeat 6 round speedloader. I wasn't sure at first when I bought it but thought I would take a risk. The rounds fit in great and when locked in does not really wiggle and sort of easy to drop in with practice."
253775,0,"I would highly suggest anyone looking at this item give serious consideration to the Taurus PT 24/7 CO2 Powered Pistol. It has a higher velocity (enough to go in one side of an aluminum can and out the other) and doesn't cost much more.It doesn't have the hop-up system...because it doesn't need it. I can nail a ""for sale"" sign on the vacant lot across from my house, and it's 50 yards away.Save yourself the disappointment of buying a semi-auto look-alike that you have to cock between rounds, and go for the CO2 version, which will fire 15 rounds as fast as you can pull the trigger."

They were not clear.Step 1 says you need (2) pieces, when you actually need 8 to complete Step 1...serious flaws. I called their customer service. Helpful person, but she,after 25-30 minutes on the phone with me, had to go get one out of the box, and look at it to better assist. It's put together. My son likes it, so that's what counts. I am a dummy for not looking at a retail store first. $10 v. $31 from Amazon."

9513,0,"I like the cut of the vest and the cattail color is pretty well represented on my monitor - maybe more of a rich brown than the rich maroon-brown I saw, by a slight margin. There's some reddishness. As many others noted it's a thin fleece, so it might not be the best value for the $30 I paid in my size. Whether that thinness becomes a longevity issue or not I'll have to see."

109578,2,"The only thing these goggles managed to do was avoid pulling my eyes out of the sockets. It took about 30 minutes to put them together (a bad sign that they come with their own tool), but the fit was never great and tended to leak. They come with an anti-fog solution that works for about 15 minutes. I used these about 20 times before the nose piece pulled loose from those tiny screws--and of course, I'd misplaced the little tool by that point. Expensive too. I guess it's back to the raccoon look for me."

438877,0,"Just used it camping this last weekend. Left burner worked. Right burner did not. Gas was flowing to it, but it would not light. We are now in the process of returning it for replacement from Amazon. They say it's currently out-of-stock, so we must wait for the new one to see if it works.I'll update this review when we get the replacement.Otherwise, we are usually happy with Coleman stoves. Hopefully, the new one will work perfectly.Happy camping!9/23/2011 - The replacement process went well. Amazon was great. Even arranging for UPS to bring us the printed return label because our printer is broken. Very helpful. We received the new stove within 10 days of sending back the 1st one, even though they had said they were out-of-stock. We set it up in the garage to see if it worked BEFORE we take it camping. YES...both burners work!Although, I can tell that subtle adjustments to the dial may not be possible. To try to get a ""medium"" flame will take some luck and practice, I think. The flame seems either ""high"" or near nothing/off. But I've had that experience with most entry-level Coleman stoves."
47461,0,Nice cot but would not recommend if you are looking for one that will be used alot.

181343,0,We inherited a 4-5 person paddle boat with the lake house we bought. We wanted to cover it so it would not fill with rain all the time. The cover arrived and seems of good quality but has a whole bunch of strapping and plastic clips all around on it. Not sure if the straps go under the boat? That would be very difficult to do each time. If I try it - I will not be able to return it so not really sure what to do! There was no info. about long straps and clips when I bought it. It does say trailerite but who trailers a paddle boat? It did show some tie down things in the picture but different than the clips on it. It will probably go back since I just want a high quality cover to pull on each time- after we use it.
249264,0,This well made unit only pumps out 3000btu. In my opinion that's not enough heat to really make a difference when winter camping. I live in Georgia and camp in a larger insulated hightop van. I seldom camp if the temps are below 40 at night. This unit will cut the chill as they say but really wont make you comfortable.I also found that running the heater on low will drain the one pound canisters in less than 8 hours. I'd say 6 hours.My other complaint is that you cannot hook this heater up to a 20# tank so your always tied to the little canisters. If you can live with this and the lower heat output then its a fine heater.
450384,0,"I love UA products and buy only compression fit. I am a medium at 155 lbs. 5'7"". I ordered a large and it was way too tight in the armpits due to the shortness of the sleeves.

131265,0,"These lugs crimp okay but no better than others and are not 100%. I had to crimp using the proper tool several times on one of the lugs out of four in order to get it to hold sufficiently.

216231,1,"If you're looking for a serious endurance training watch, this ugly contraption does it all. It tells you time, time splits, heartrate, speed (running or biking-tho the biking needs more computer parts on your bike), distance traveled, elevation, temperature, etc.I've used heartrate monitors from Nike and Polar and none has come close to how sophisticated this watch is. It truly is a mini computer.If you're looking for just a heartrate monitor, you're better off with the Polar F11 or others in the F series. But if you're looking for serious endurance performance monitoring...this is an excellent choice. Beware, the watch isn't pretty and the foot pod is ugly as hell; you have to purchase the infrared doo-hickey (IrDA adapter) to download info from your watch to the computer and you need to purchase two more little devices(cadence monitor and speedometer) just to use the watch for the bike..."
166674,1,"Every year my husband goes to cub scout day camp with my son and every year he comes back and says ""I wish I had a small fold up stool"". So for father's day I got him this one.

My husband said it was easy to open and close and nice and light weight. He said it was perfect for what he needed."

252902,2,"After reading the reviews, I thought these would be perfect for my 9 year old daughter. The expandable ends don't stay where you put them and that is frustrating. But after watching her and helping her swing them for double dutch I have discovered that they get twisted up really fast and it's really annoying. (I mean that one rope twists itself up, not two ropes twisting together.) They also kind of hurt when they hit you if you mess up because they are a pretty durable plastic. Overall, I am pretty dissapointed. I hope this review helps. Good luck!!!"
252190,2,"I had an ""EZ-UP"" 10x10' shelter in my back yard, and when one crossbar broke, it broke 2 others. If anyone had been sitting in the chair in my back yard, they'd have become a shishcabob from the cheap thin metal used to make these canopies. Although EZ-UP sells products on their web site to facilitate holding these canopies down in the wind, they do NOT cover ANY ""wind or rain damage,"" and although this, in my view, was NOT a factor of why the frame failed, the company's first response when I called to get a return authorization after it failed only after about 8 months of use, they quickly stated ""we don't cover wind or rain damage, cut me off, and had apparently NO reguard for anyone's safety, stating that if it was raining or even in the slightest wind (I think it failed in around 2 mph ""winds""), their ""warantee"" did not cover it! They said I could send it in and THEY would determine (after paying an outrageous sum of money to send it back) IF they might replace it, but that they likely would not. The people at the company were rude, had NO concern that their product had some safety issues, and so I'm looking to buy something less expensive, and that lasts longer! INteresting, they told me that they don't cover ANY wond or rain ""damage"", yet they also sell hold-downs & it states on their web site (& apparently in directions that I never received with mine) NOT to fold it up if it was wet, but to leave it up!I had a MUCH less expensive shade that latested MUCH longer and I'd recommend others to do the same, or to buy an industrial model that CLEARLY stated in their warantee that the product can withstand wind up to ""x"" mph & that it is made to withstand rain as well.After my experience with this company's product, and their staff in the returns dept., I would avoid ever buying one of these again! I received mine as a gift (that cost my friend over $200!)There are MUCH better, sturdier, and safer canopies out there.If I could give this product a zero or negative score, I would!These canopies are NOT NEARLY as sturdy as I recall them being years ago (or perhaps that was another brand?)I expect these canopies will be recalled in time due to safety issues.I would STRONGLY recommend buying something less expensive and sturdier from another manufacturer! I've had others that cost MUCH less that lasted MUCH longer than this and were made better!"
119479,1,I bought this for my first grade son. I was looking for something with minimal pockets and durable. This was perfect. I use the lap top pouch for his folders and etc. It is a nice way for him to keep things separated. The front pocket organizes all his school pens and pencils perfectly. It also has a padded pocket for a cell phone but we don't use that. We have only used it for a month but it has so far held up with my rough and tumble boy. I have had to already wash it and it came out like new again. Can't beat this especially for the price.
374235,0,I was looking for thick cotton socks and this is the closest I could find. There's a bit too much acrylic in these (can be sweaty) but they're better than anything else I've found.
112169,1,This is a great quality belt for the price. Tiger Claw makes some nice products.
16025,0,"After much consideration of all products listed, I chose the Merit 720T. It was in my price range, and sounded great. I received the product, and put it together easily. Everything was going fine, until I plugged it in. It would not run. At all. Any part, whatsoever. I reviewed the book, looked at troubleshooting, and reviewed the DVD that came with it. I took every part off and checked it. It absolutely did not work. I got the number for customer service, but - the hours were Monday thru Friday, 8am to 5 pm. Those are the EXACT hours I am at work. No after hours, no weekends, no help on their website. I had received this item on a Friday night. So I email them, and then I have my husband call the next Monday morning. He was put on hold for so long he gave up. I emailed them again, and he called the customer service again. Finally, he got through, and after a lengthy conversation with a representative, they concluded that the ""safety key"" had too much glue to make a good magnetic connection, and that is why it would not run. When my husband took off the safety key, pried off most of the glue, and put it back on, it ran just fine. It is still running great, now that the problem is fixed. In all fairness, they did send a replacement safety key that week.It has alot of features on it, although I mainly use the heart rate monitor, timer, speed, and distance. There are different programs for incline, speed, and distance, but I just haven't gotten into that yet.Overall, great product, could do better with customer service."
162730,0,I bought this to keep track of my heart rate while cycling. It didn't disappoint at first however it's pretty annoying to check the time by pressing a button because it's not always visible and secondly the fast release tab on the strap monitor broke withing a couple uses. I'm not one to abuse my items and with moderate use this happen. So if you're serious about training I would suggest putting in the extra and buy a better model
230123,0,"These snowshoes have two flaws that prevent them from being equal to other budget snowshoes.1. They are significantly heavier than offerings by Tubbs, Redfeather, Atlas.This weight is mostly in the thicker aluminum used in the frame and cleats. This problem is not easily rectified.2. They collect snow in the right conditions, not just a little. This can be improved.I found my pair was improperly assembled. There is a plastic fabric piece that is installed above the aluminum cleat. Switch it to underneath the cleat and it will shed snow much better. This requires a screwdriver and socket(8mm/5/16""). Thankfully these weren't rivet assembled.The back cleat should also have plastic underneath the ""pocket"", but I don't know how to remedy this.These shoes are made by Pacific Cycles, Makers of Huffy bicycles. I'm simultaneously impressed with how well designed these snowshoes are, and dumbstruck that they have these two stupid flaws that make them significantly inferior to other budget snowshoes (that cost significantly more).These might still be worth buying, they are quite usable, but I wish I could return mine. Unfortunately I waited too long."
430683,0,This product was what I expected. Very useful and easy to use. I like how simple and solid this stand is. I just don't understand how Amazon charged me for shipping when I bought a hold package with free shipping just becouse this stand was shipped to me late. Amazon you owe me $7.88

428062,0,"Being a child of the 70's, I remember having a wonderful, large, well-constructed rod-hockey game. Actually, my brother and I had two. On the older version the players simply rotated, and on the next version they could slide around the board. I remember hours and hours of fun with this game, which never broke, and therefore I ordered this for my 10-year old son. While it is nice to share the fun of this game with the younger set, the quality is sadly inferior to the ones I remember. First, the rink is smaller. Second, the players don't slide smoothly. You hear lots of bumping and sticking underneath the ""ice,"" which is inaccessible. I think the rods of various players are hitting each other underneath, and this slows down the play considerably. From a design perspective, the only complaint I have is that the goalie control is off to the right hand side, not in the center (behind the net) as I remember it. This makes it hard to react fast. All in all, at the price Franklin charges this is a reasonable way to share your love of Rod hockey with your kids. But don't expect anything similar to what you played and loved as a kid yourself."
164321,1,"This case will not keep the rods from breaking,(IT is a soft case not a hard case)But they are not getting bang around and tangle up in back of vehicle anymore.I've going to purchase another for my wife rod & reels.I love how easy it is to carry the rods to were I fish !!!!!!""Great product for the price...""I recommend this case..."

Good quality material, but I do not thing I would ever purchase them again because of the belt issue."
24632,0,"Using a metric system for advertising I ended up with a ball too large for the exercises. Additionally, the chart that accompanied the ball was not for the size received. As a result the exercises are limited to those that work with the ball. No other choice was available at the time."

This one is snug but eventually I'll fit it as I lose more weight. Just wish I had ordered the XXL. I would get this, just order a size up."
440899,1,"I bought the ""heavy"" version of this product mainly to help rehab my shoulder after arthroscopic surgery. It's a great product as far as it goes; but if you have any muscularity, you definitely want to go with the extra heavy. There are no ""instructions"" with the product, so an inventive imagination is a must on ways to use it other than bicep curls and upright rows.The biggest drawback is the shipping charge. At only cents less than the product itself, I thought it was a bit sporty. I guess when you factor in gas, time, sales tax and inconvenience, it's worth it."
181902,0,"This is a decent, inexpensive helmet.Pros:- This fits pretty well thanks to the internal, self adjusting, elastic hat band inside- It's lightweight- The chin strap is easily adjustable, stays where you set it and is comfortable- It's inexpensiveCons:- That internal, self-adjusting, elastic band I mentioned earlier? It's constantly squeezing your head. You won't notice this on short rides but after an hour or two you become pretty conscious of it. There are two plastic pieces in front that will dig into your forehead. Oh, my hat size is approximately 7 1/8. If your head is much bigger than this then this helmet is probably not for you.- The visor isn't very effective at blocking out the sun and mine actually arrived a little canted. It's thin plastic. What can you do?All in all, this is a nice, entry-level helmet for someone who doesn't have a big head."

465055,1,This is a great product and it was a at a great price. It was half what a store would ask you to pay.
363904,0,"The problem with these is that the liner inside fits in a way that the crotch of the exterior of the shorts rides really low, and creates an unattractive pouch in the front, like you are hiding some kind of accident in your pants. I don't know about you, but when I spend money on workout clothes, I expect them to be functional, but I don't think it's too much to expect them not to look weird. Other than this, the quality of the materials is great, so if you by chance have a body type that can wear these a bit better, I would recommend trying them on in the store first to make sure, which unfortunately kind of defeats the convenience of online shopping."
78208,0,"I saw the picture of this bike and had to have it. However, I was pushed to the limit of frustration after having to return the first to bikes for missing or broken parts. I liked the style of the bike so much that I endured the frustration of the first two mishaps! FINALLY, I received the third bike and all was the way it should be. I'm giving this review a 3 not because I don't like the bike but the frustration it took to FINALLY get things right. I don't usually complain about minor issues, (I usually fix it myself) but I had no choice(due to a major part missing, and broke) but to return the bike twice.As far as the bike, I've taken it out on two rides, a 5mile and then a 10 mile (nothing major). So far the ride is smooth and easy. It took me a few adjustments to the seat and handle bar before I was totally comfortable. The look of the bike is definitely inviting. The gear shifting is a bit choppy but I'm sure it is because I really didn't take time to adjust the gear mechanism and so forth. The height of the bike is perfect for my 6ft, 205 lbs frame. I have since bought a few odd and ends bike accessories to enhance the bike and style it to my personality.Overall, I like the ride of the bike. It feels smooth and safe. I want to make this bike into my second form of transportation. So far, I think the bike can stand of to everyday riding. We shall see. If you are sceptical in buying this bike(like I was), let me tell you that I am very happy that I purchased the bike. Again, my biggest beef was the hassle of returning the bike due to parts missing or broke. Hopefully when you order this bike they will get it right. If so, you should be very happy with the overall look, and performance of a $300 class bike!See ya'll down the road!Dia;-)"
52520,0,"I needn't remind you how stiff this sword is if you've read the other reviews...I think everyone is aware by now that this could constitute as a weapon in its own right, almost as lethal as a bokken. (Heck, maybe that's a plus for you...but read on.) With that being said, no one likes getting hit with bokkens during training...it's painful; and it could potentially break bones or worse. Though this weapon is covered with foam, I have to say it's still without clemency. It is very firm, does not bend much from impact, and the durability of the foam is easily compromised...but not the fiber glass core. I've had the foam peel off on the tip simply by resting the tip of it on the ground...I have only had this for a few weeks too. I've made no mistakes as to strike it against anything solid; I've been using this strictly for practicing with against the air.Anyone buying this to spar with another human being will likely be greatly disappointed...for even if you can be careful enough to not harm your training partner, you could harm this beautifully designed weapon just by lightly scraping it against a rigid surface, let alone if you plan on smashing it against another person's training weapon.Otherwise, this is an amazingly aesthetic and functional solo training weapon. To preserve the atypically pointed tip on this foam weapon, take heed not to strike the ground, or rest it as much on the ground as I do. Take the time to lay it flat down on its side. Respect it and it'll continue to look amazing, and perform amazingly if you want to show off your martial arts skills with this style of sword.Also, I wasn't too happy with the detail on the guard as I was expecting to be, since the guard is essentially the same gray hue as the entire brand, (which was misleading when you look at the product photo) so I just took a black sharpie and colored in the designs, crevices, and runes. It made these features stand out much more while still looking authentic from a distance. Not something I suggest if you have unsteady hands...the mistakes and stray marks will not come out.On the negative side of this review, my product came in the most terrible packaging I've ever experienced. The box was literally smashed and caved in, likely stacked under something very heavy in the UPS delivery truck. It had no padding what to speak of, such as bubble wrap or anything like that. There was also a deep depression put into the brand, and one side was rather notched along the `edge' of the brand. There were a few other minor blemishes that I needn't go into detail about, but the point of the matter is: I received a damaged product. It wasn't damaged to the point of me hating this, as much of my review is positive...but just don't expect to get this in mint-condition...mine was far from that. I might have given it 4 stars instead of 3 if it weren't for this issue.Overall, I have mixed feelings. I love how this weapon looks when I train with it as a martial artist. The blemishes I mentioned are hardly noticeable; it is still an absolutely beautiful and intimidatingly realistic looking sword. It has great handling, balance, and maneuverability. It really catches people's attention. It could also be used effectively to fend off an assailant if such a dire need arose...perhaps even knock someone out with a well-placed strike to the temple, but of course you could do that with any commonplace household item capable of bludgeoning.I can't say I can recommend this, at least not for a martial artist, larper, or weapon's practioner. Sure.... it's safe in that it won't eviscerate anyone... but the price is outrageous in my opinion, especially for a weapon that was received blatantly damaged and ill-packaged. You could get a pair of high quality white oak bokkens for this price, plus more. But if you really like the look, you have plenty of money, and were enticed by the striking artistic design like I was, go for it..."
115237,0,"I tried using this for a bike ride ... and there's mixed feelings.1) i had no display to view my video so i had no clue (until after the fact) that what i was recording was clipped or at an angle. Maybe a laser guide and/or a level to help.2) since the cam is so small, it was hard to keep the camera as still as possible, which caused a video so jerky that it makes the Blair Witch Project a joke. Standing still and moving it is fine ... but once in motion on the bike, it was starting to make me feel dizzy.3) On the positive side, it is a neat way to capture video doing things you normally cannot (ie. biking, snowboardin, etc...). And for the price that Amazon gives, it's a decent deal."
397234,1,"Great product, directions for operation a little confusing but once you get the hang of it it's great. I like the wireless feature, much better than wires lining your bike frame. I recommend mounting on the rear wheel fork and rear wheel. This will allow easy transport and taking off and putting on the front wheel."

Also, the belt isn't a ""true"" belt in that it doesn't go all the way around the pants so you can't buy a larger size and just tighten the waist."

Although the brand is Seiko, the watch reflects that of a diver watch for half the price. The style and appearance of the watch is easy to mix and match with your every day casual wear and business casual. The luster of the band and the black face oftens gives the impression that the value of the watch is a lot more than it really is.A few people have complained about the date, but mine works fine.The watch is a smart value purchase. I a few similar designer watches from Emporio Armani and ESQ, this Seiko pruchase is easily as comparable and for less $$$"

470139,0,"I'm disappointed with this product. The directions for assembly are pitiful. I still haven't been able to get the computer console on the bike. It simply does not fit on the support bars, and even after calling the company, I haven't been able to resolve this issue. I've used it a little bit, but without the console, it isn't that great. It's also much noisier than I thought it would be.The bottom line is that if I had known how difficult it was to assemble properly, I wouldn't have ordered it."

489715,0,"FirstAlert pastes a promotional sticker across the front of the safe. When I tried to remove the sticker it does not peel off cleanly. As a result I have spent over an hour trying to get the sticker off and I am still not nearly finished. The reviews extolling the virtues of this safe are true and I am pleased with the safe itself. I am so mad at FirstAlert right now that I really want to just give the product one star but I will go ahead and give it 3 because the safe really is a great value. I don't know if all the safes have the sticker attached with some type of miracle adhesive or if I just got lucky and had got a sticker with more glue than normal but I can't give more than 3 stars to a product the requires me to spend over and hour cleaning it because of their marketing add on.If anyone has an idea for how to remove the sticker residue I am open to suggestions. So far I have tried rubbing with alcohol, a steam gun, and peanut butter. The peanut butter worked best oddly enough and the closet I put the safe in smells great if you like the smell of peanuts but the sticker residue is still there just great diminished in the area of the safe I tried. There is still a larger area that I have not even started on yet.Given a Mulligan, I am not sure if I would buy the safe again or not just because of the dang sticker."

Rather than rent a set at your local golf course, just get this decent set which is reasonably priced. It pays for itself after five to six rounds! I'm an Amazon Prime shopper so two-day shipping was free.

Since i bought this one, i am wearing it everyday and put my new Seiko aside. I have not noticed any color change in the belt yet. It suits the summer very well if you wear colorful t-shirts and jeans a lot. Only one concern for it, as you can see from the pic, the digital screen is not that big, therefore numbers are not that big. It is not an issue for me, but based on previous reviews, some people don't like this.."
437910,0,"I purchased the Gazelle Freestyle about 3 weeks ago and I really enjoy it. It is a pretty fun exercise that one can do just watching tv. My mother has really bad joints and she enjoyed the Gazelle and said that it actually makes her joints feel better.However, after using the machine for about 4-5 days, the squeak began (as many other reviewers have mentioned) and it can get very loud. Also, I noticed that the mechanism holding up the cord that sways the pedals back in forth was not moving like it should be and was very tight. Then my mother got on and it suddenly snapped and she nearly fell! It often gets very loose, and if I dont keep tightening it, it will pop again! So just beware of that happening!Other than that, its a fun machine and does give cardio and leg workouts."

494962,1,"By far the best water, soda, juice bottle ever. I got this for my Dad after I bought one for myself and decided no person should be without one ever. Mine is the 1.5 L and it is perfect for me since I have 2 kids who always want a sip of whatever Momma's got instead. We take the kids on small hikes and this is the perfect size for three of us (a baby, a four year old and me) so I don't bother with the multiple bottles anymore which free's up lots of room in the pack. And frankly camel backs don't hold very much water unless you are willing to part with alot of money so they never really did it for us. The larger size also helps me remember to drink enough water daily which is always a problem for me. I use it every day and besides the beating it takes at home with two kids and the hiking, it keeps on ticking. My bottle has gotten dented but like most people with Siggs I can tell you where I got each dent with pride. Have I mentioned how great this thing is in the wilderness yet? Let me mention it again. Siggs are super light which means the weight you carry is all water. How great is that? Especially when you are packing a kid! It's the screw top that really impresses me most though. It has really stood up to ALOT, and I mean alot, it's been everything from a teething ring to thrown on the floor because one year olds just can't help but snatch and grab and we are currently in the 'if I drop or throw this, will mommy go get it' phase. My daughter even tried to use it as a lever while my husband just stood there all proud of his ""ducktape badge worthy"" child! Needless to say I wasn't too happy about that, but the thing is indestructable!! And if you're really pressed for room in your pack the cap easily can be attached to the outside of your pack by a loop. The liner conforms to dents perfectly so no wierd taste after the dent either. Keeps the water cold! I highly recogmend them, they are the ultimate in quality. You will never need to throw it away but if you should you can recycle them too. How great is that? Personally I am all for things that don't end up in my trash! I feel a horrible guilt over throwing my money away and hurting the environment at the same time. It's so much easier to just do the right thing and never worry about things like that."
410657,1,"More than just a modern conception, the product misses perfection by ""that much!"" as Maxwell Smart would say.This is my second pair after losing the first one. Had these gloves for well over a year and can attest to it's washability, utility, and ability to endure lots of wear and tear. The gripping is surprising excellent and even handles surfaces excessively coated with body oil -ensuring safe use. Gloves are very comfortable and cool looking too.These gloves are great but I'm only saying this latter part because I appreciate perfection in design AND practicality. The shame is that if these were sewn just a little bit better (no loose threads) it would the ""IT"" product of the year on anyone's list."
383918,0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415CvuVzyDL._SL75_.jpgUsed this about 4 months ago with no problem, then charged it up and stored inside on shelf for next use. Even with the push button charge indicator, it appeared to be ready-to-go. Wrong! During the recent power outage, only the LED's and radio worked. I tried to charge it, but it would not take, and the red, low-charge-status light never progressed to the amber, mid-charge or green, full-charge status. I removed the lead-acid battery and checked it with a multi-meter. There was only 2.6 volts on the 12vdc/3ah lead-acid battery. (confirmed at store that specializes in batteries). (THE LOW LIGHT LED's AND RADIO OPERATE OFF A SEPARATE BATTERY SOURCE AND FUNCTION WITHOUT THIS BATTERY) No suitable replacement could be sourced outside of Black & Decker (who bought out Vector in 2006) . I called Black & Decker's Tech Dept., and they stated that you CANNOT LET THE BATTERY RUN DOWN TO A NO-CHARGE CONDITION or the battery would lose its' ability to regain and maintain a charge! Furthermore, THERE IS NOTHING IN THE INSTRUCTION AND CARE MANUAL THAT ADDRESSES THIS! A replacement battery is obtainable only through Black & Decker at a cost of $[...] (+tax and whatever they charge for shipping). My nearest dealer is 40 miles away, (No dealer support in my metro area of +840,000?) Black & Decker now markets this unit, in its' corporate orange-black motif, as the PS50LSB Electomate 50 Plus. THE BOTTOM LINE: When you count on backup light/power source, at the very least, you need to have all the info on how to care and maintain the equipment, so that it's ready when you need it. Vector/B&D; neglected to disclose all the information to accomplish this. IT IS A PORTABLE, FEATURED UNIT WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BE A HANDY, RESOURCEFUL PRODUCT, BUT RELIABILITY AND REPUTATION IS TAINTED BY UNWARRANTED EXPENSE TO THE CONSUMER DUE TO LACK OF DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION THAT IS REQUIRED TO CARE AND MAINTAIN. USING NON-STANDARD, PROPRIETARY BATTERY, WITH FINICKY PROPERTIES DIMINISHES THIS OTHERWISE WELL DESIGNED PRODUCT."
103811,1,"I thoroughly enjoy these pants. I've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities. These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I've been through - including 5.11, Woolrich, etc. I think the best feature on these pants - which isn't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side (for me, the strong side). This pocket, placed directly behind the front pocket (and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer's) has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached. The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size, such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis. My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over. These are great."

42729,1,"Both EA Sports Active and More Workouts are great for giving you a LOT of potential workouts and keeping you motivated. I have found the 60 day challenge workouts for the More Workouts version are more challenging than the 30 day challenge workouts for the original. I also love that they added a warm up and cool down to each. My favorite cardio routines on the original were the step cardio boxing and the dancing. On the newer version, the squash is a blast. I keep wanting to do it over and over to see how far I can get without missing the ball. I also like some of the obstacle course workouts and the running now has a view vs. just a track as in the original. Here are some of the things I wish they had done differently:Be able to combine workouts in both versions to create the custom workoutsAllow ""replacement"" workouts in the challenge (I wish this was in the first as well). For example, I have trouble with some of the high impact moves due to joint/back problems and large natural breasts that bounce even with a good bra (i.e. the skipping (jump rope) and stride jumps) I wish they would allow you to chose an alternate workout in the challenge vs. just deleting it so you still keep the same time, calories, etc. This is my biggest complaint.Finally, it is annoying that they keep repeating the ""watch me"" in the warm up exercises. Once you have done it once, that should go away just like the video in the regular workouts.Overall, both workouts are a great value for the money and More Workouts just builds on the great start from EA Sports Active. The controller recognition/response seems better as well."

You end up just standing there watching everyone else (who have memorized the moves) work out. You don't need any special equipment for that - just watch ESPN! The actual step product seems adequate, but the video is useless unless you've stepped before. Yes, they start with basic steps (for about 30 seconds), but quickly move on before you even figure out which foot belongs where (remember, they're facing you as you watch them, meaning you have to reverse everything they do).

Previous reviewer makes a good point about the lack of reinforcement in the sides--it's only shaped like a square when it is fully loaded. Mine is maybe half-full in the top section, but with the stove in the bottom I don't care to make it too much heavier. It's definitely bigger than I was expecting, plenty of capacity. Overall, it gets the job done--my stove and all it's accessories are in one place, with lots of room left for miscellaneous camping storage."

267167,2,"I can't recommend this lock at all, it basically failed the third time I used it, and I was able to break it open with a small pair of pliers.I bought one of these locks because it looked sturdy and was quite cheap. There were no instructions about how to mount the lock on your bike, but I eventually worked it out. The cable is coiled quite tightly, and is very hard to stretch around a bike and railing, especially if you want to lock up one of the wheels too.The third time I used it, I was unable to unlock it. I had set the combination the first time I used it, and hadn't changed it. I tried a few numbers each side of the combination for each dial but it none worked. I ended up cutting the cable with a small pair of pliers, which took around 3 minutes. I don't think these locks are very secure, as anyone with decent pliers or a bolt cutter could have done it in about less than 30 seconds.I managed to get the lock open later by going through all the numbers. The number that opened it was very different to how I had set it. It looks as if I accidentally turned the dial which allows you to set the combination while trying to get the cable through my spokes. Then when I closed the lock and moved the dials to relock it, I was actually setting the combination to something random.This lock is difficult to use, easy to use wrongly, and very easy to break open. Don't buy it."

94933,0,"While this case looks fairly nice on the wall, it lacks the fit and finish I expected for the price. The materials are flimsy and the painted wood doesn't extend to the rear of the case door; from a rear angle you can see bare pine. A good purchase for home, not so great for the office."
205721,0,The rack composition is lite-weight and easy to install. Some of the rubber components are flimsy (they fell off right away) and the straps that hold the bike in a locked position are NOT to be trusted. The strap broke before I even took off with the bikes on the road.The straps to tie down to the spare tire are not long enough and you NEED alternate method of securing the rack to the tire. Go to Wal Mart and by tie-downs with hooks.Make sure you put a pad on the bottom rung of the rack otherwise it will rub and scratch your tire.The rack is ok for the price. I took it on a 600 mile highway speed ride. As long as you buy those extra straps and tie the bike to the rack with line and secure it....you will be ok.Hope it helps.

151079,0,"In the last decade, people have been rooting for this small flashlight that was always considered to be cool, with it's aircraft aluminum 'armour', and bright beam. This thing was once considered to be more popular than a lightsaber.These qualities stand to this day and should be considered should you buy this as a gift or lighting tool for someone. It's strong reaching beam fires a fair distance in spot mode, and a moderately effective flood mode lights up a room quite nicely.Now, with these kudos, there are some things to keep in mind when buying this light:Unless you get silver/puter or light blue, this black knight can be easily lost in the dark if you don't have it on. Also, the fact that it's a heavy duty metal doesn't help it's chances from a fairly tall fall. This thing is not shock absorbent. Maybe it's casing is, but it's innards aren't. And to top it all off, this flashlight is more thirsty for batteries than a 5 litre gas guzzling Mustang. After a good half hour, it dims a litte, but a little too soon.So, what do I recommend above the Mini Mag? Two great recommendations: the Energizer Double Barrel 'xenon' flashlight, with it's great looks, and better battery life. The xenon bulb is also brighter than the Mag's 'T-Bulb'. Another great light is the Rayovac AA Industrial flashlight. Now, this flashlight does not have the same distance reach as the Mini Mag (in spot mode) since this light is built with a 'wide spot', that acts like a super (and I mean super for an AA light) mini spot light, and maybe not at long distances, but at least for lighting up.....the WOODS! I find this to be the best light for when you're lost in the woods. If you are one of those people who walk a lot at night, especially near any forests and wooded areas, then the Rayovac AA Industrial light is the one-if you aren't interested in an L.E.D lights, which should be your first choice. You'd probably think that a Rayovac AA flashlight wouldn't be powerful enough for to light up the thick of the woods in the night and twenty feet in front of you...well, guess again!! You'd better get one and try it out. It's output is nearly as bright as a 2D Maglite in flood mode. Really! I carry it everywhere with me (knapsack). And mega shock resistant!!So, hats off to Mag for a great run, and for making a cool and powerful light with a few self defeating faults."
43038,0,The Abdonimal Board Crunch Bench DF 6000 is a beautiful bench. It took more than 45 minutes to assemble and I had many bolts and other mechanisims left over. It does have several positions ranging from easy to very difficult. My problem with this bench was that it does not fold for storage. It is very heavy (45 lbs) and not easy to move around. I had no other alternative but to return this item.
390676,0,"This is a decent bottle holder that is decently made for the price; I had purchased it as a second bottle holder on my road bike.

Overall, I think there are bottle holders out there that are more fitted than this one that would be better suited for someone with a road bike."

I have to change my socks at least once a day, and I'm not super sweater. I have other boots, no sweat problems. But with these it's just a matter of time before my feet are freezing because I'm rotting in cold, wet socks.And, they. are. hard. I know you need to break boots in an all, but they're hard as heck. Tight. I'm talking tight on my instep. Feels like a vice-grip on the top of my foot. They're easing up, but I don't know if they'll ever be truly comfortable. And maybe I'm the wrong person to review these, because I don't ride, or muck out stalls, or whatever. I live in the city. But I wanted a pair of boots that were as comfy as the boots I wore in High School. Not so much.If you're a half-size, get the half size. Don't size down. I can barely get my hoof into these as it is.If I had the money to spend again, would I buy these boots? Probably not.But they're well put together. I'll probably have them two decades from now and may then, just maybe they'll be comfortable, before disintegrating entirely."
228823,2,"I bought this at the LBS, which is great because I can take it back. I wanted it for my wife's bike, but the Bontragger seat that came with bike does not have the more vertical rails that this bag would fit on. They are just straight out. The bag clip has about a 30 degree or more angle, so won't fit at all. So, I tried it on my mountain bike, the rails on that saddle are too close. I tried it on my Brooks saddle, their too far apart, I tried it on the Scott saddle, again, it won't fit. So, what saddle will it fit? I suggest taking your saddle in to the shop to see what will fit before you buy one. I'm going back to the strap and hook, simple system, no worries about if it will fit. Other than that, I do like the bag style. Looks like it would have been very useful system. Too bad it won't work."

58639,2,"I have other larger Igloo Maxcold coolers, which have thicker walls of insulation, and actually do keep things colder longer than a regular thin-walled cooler. Maxcold is supposed to be their ""premium"" sub-brand. This product, however, is nothing more than a conventional Igloo Playmate cooler dressed up with the blue-silver color and a flimsy, thin piece of styrofoam under the lid. I was very disappointed.The walls of the cooler are no thicker than a cheap Playmate cooler, and as you would expect, it does NOT keep things colder longer. Any ice placed in this cooler will be melted within 12-18 hours at room temperature, not 3-5 days, as is typical with a Maxcold cooler. The only difference is a useless piece of thin styrofoam under the lid, which will surely break up and fall out soon. As any teenage science student can tell you, cold air falls, so insulation ABOVE the cold mass is nearly useless. Why did Igloo do this instead of make the walls and floor of the cooler thicker (as they do with other Maxcold coolers)? The answer is that some marketing guy at Igloo (who flunked science and had never used a cooler) thought it would be clever to slap the Maxcold label on a cheap Playmate cooler to fool consumers into paying more, without spending anything to add thicker walls.Message to Igloo marketing geniuses: This will backfire on you. The fastest way to kill a higher-end brand is to put the label on a low-quality, non-performing product, and disappoint your target consumer. I will never buy an Igloo product again."

I read the manufacturers website [...]and realized the difference between these two words.""Telescoping"" expands the length of the pole from one usable length to an almost double length, while still being usable.""Slide"" just means that the pole can be released from its fixed, usable length, and tucked down to the size of the net, making it more compact, but unusable, for storage."
77355,1,"I bought this because I was interested in training my body to maintain a higher cadence than I was used to. I paired it up with the CS300 heart monitor/cyclocomputer.The signal is strong, and reliably reports my cadence. Here's what stuck out to me:1) The CS300 doesn't pick up your cadence right away from being idle. I'd say it takes about 7-10 seconds before it starts showing your cadence. Probably not the cadence sensors fault though; I'm pretty sure it's sending the signal, it's just the CS300 display unit probably does a ""sampling over time"" method and waits a while until the next time period is over. 0 stars off2) The sensor unit can be easily dislodged from its position, thus un-aligning it from the magnet. When this happens it will no longer report cadence information to the display unit. This could probably be alleviated if I had used a pair of 3rd hand wire tighteners to really clinch the zip-ties down sturdy onto the bike frame, but alas I do not own a pair of 3rd hand wire tighteners, and I doubt the average person does either. Tightening the zip ties by hand does not tighten them enough to keep the sensor from moving around if you accidentally kick it. Minus one point for this.3) The unit came with extra zip ties, and an extra large amount of tape for the magnet. These will allow you to mount the unit up to 3 times if you need to remove it for any reason. I'm pretty impressed with this because most products don't think that far in advance, and it shows that Polar is indeed interested in your product experience post-purchase. Adding one point back for this attention to detail."

83249,1,"As it is, this bag is a good value. The canvas fabric is acceptably sturdy but it could be heavier; it should stand up to a few years of heavy use, but we'll see. The main compartment is large enough to take a full bag of groceries or a few large (11x14"") sketch books. The strap cinches up easily so the bag doesn't get in your way when you're riding a bicycle. One VERY good design feature: the side bottle pockets, which are exactly-sized to take 32oz Nalgene bottles. They also handle travel mugs well. Another good feature is the two loops on the outside of the flap, which are ideal for mounting bike lights on.Downsides are the pathetic interior zippered pocket, which is destined to be chewed to ribbons by pens and any small metal items you put in it. Similarly, the front pockets don't have snaps or velcro, rendering them unsuitable for loose items.Given the popularity of this type of bag, the manufacturer should consider a revised or ""deluxe"" version, with a zippered main compartment; a thicker, possibly removable strap, heavier fabric, a better interior pocket, closeable front pockets, and maybe small pockets on the outside of the bottle compartments."

If you are a female keeper, try to find a good soccer/sports store where you can try the gloves on before purchasing. There are some companies producing goalie gloves with the female hand in mind (although I for one can not break down and wear pink gloves!)but most are still designed for the wider male hand.Good luck."
411299,1,"This is exactly what you need for a chin-up bar to put in a doorway. It comes with easily-installed brackets to hold the bar in place; the length of the bar adjusts gradually in a screw-like motion to fit into the doorway; and it is cheap. DO NOT use the bar without the brackets, as other reviewers have noted.The bar also comes with two foam grips. The grips are nice, and helps you hang on until the end of the set, especially if (like me) your grip fails before your back and forearm muscles. I haven't had grips on my previous chin-up bars, and the grips definitely help. The foam will probably wear out in a year or so, depending on how much you use the bar. I think the grips can't be replaced, and then you'll probably have to use gloves as the polished chrome surface of the bar is really too slick to hold on to for long. Or you could just buy a new bar with fresh grips, as this thing is really cheap.Now go get pumped up."

118351,0,"I just recently purchased this tent after a tremendous amount of time and online reviews. I chose this tent since it had a lot of room, quality and satisfied customers for the money. The truth is, if you look at a lot of tent reviews, they are mostly positive. I attribute this to the users-camping is fun! So if people enjoy their camping trip and have a great time-they will give credit to their tent too...When I got this, I decided to set it up in our back yard and let the kids sleep in it the first night. Ideal condition-nice weather and the tent set on a perfectly cut, level smooth lawn. I set the ten up according to direction, and when raising the tent one of the elbows snapped! Not sure if this was a weak link, but it was not forced very hard and seem to break from the weight of the tent being raised.The other big issue is the FLOOR. It is made of the same materials as the walls. I read other users comment on this and bought a heavy duty tarp and put it under the tent. Well after one night of expected use including a 4 and 7 year old who took their shoes off inside the tent, I discovered a tear on the floor! Again no stick or stones underneath..Yes, there are many great qualities that I agree with in the other reviews, but come on! I really don't want to spend my camping vacation worrying about repairs with duct tape and patches. This problems arose with very light use.

424069,0,"Have osteoarthritis in left shoulder aggravated by years of powerlifting. Weightlifting (lighter weights), however, now seems to help, strengthening the ligaments and muscles around the joint to help keep it in place. Was looking for something that would provide support while weight training, protecting the joint while allowing me to strengthen the tissue around it. The Omo Train Shoulder Support works as well as one might expect for a shoulder brace given the dynamics involved. It seems to me that you need something that is firmly anchored on two ends in order to provide enough pressure and support for a shoulder joint. The Omo Train was the only one that I found in my research that appeared to do this. It is well stitched and most of the material is breathable and appears durable. It is not neoprene but an elasticized cloth that one might expect to see used to wrap a weak or injured joint. Been using it now for a couple of months. It seems to help. It' s not a cure-all. I doubt any shoulder brace can be for conditions similar to mine. It's just a tough joint to protect. So for this reason, three (3) stars, would be the highest rating I would likely give any shoulder brace. Concerns: I purchased the largest device and it still feels too snug around the arm to me. Also the straps that pull the device to the opposite shoulder seem a bit weaker than they could be and while they work fine now, I fear they may lose elasticity over time."

I like the feel of it sleeping, very firm and a nice texture, the sleeping side is a velour-like material that is not slippery. The only problem is that they do puncture, the first one after I gave it some medium rough treatment on a concrete floor, the second due to a rip, plain and simple and not caused by anything I did but sleep on it, which the little adhesive things they include for puncture repair were not up to the job for fixing it.

458081,0,"Overall, I pretty much got what I was expecting to get which was a decent practice putting mat for a lower price than some others that are offered. This could be picky, but a few things I noticed:1 - It advertises 8 feet, but that's if the mat would actually stay perfectly straight without any creases and if you putted from the back edge of the mat; even then the hole is placed up a couple inches from the back of the mat. Because of this, you actually get around 7 1/2 feet. Not a really big deal to me, but maybe for some.2 - It advertises a regulation size cup. I looked up what a regulation diameter is and it is 4 1/4 inches. This cup measures just a bit short of 4 inches. I actually find that to be a convenience because it makes you be a little more accurate with your putts, but it would be nice if the manufacturer actually delivered what it said.I also noticed that if you miss your putt by just a bit thus missing the return track, the ball will stay on top of the mat defeating the purpose of returning the ball automatically. A small book underneath the back helped with that problem. Also, if you crush it there is nothing to stop the ball from going over the back edge, but if you hit it that hard you deserve the punishment of going to retrieve the ball yourself.Overall, I'm happy with it and it gets the job done."

I thought these would be a great alternative for my office when my feet get cold. Or when I'm out walking to keep my hands warm in the winter.The problem is that no matter what I do, I can't get them to be warm consistently. Sometimes they are wonderful and hot and last for hours. Other times I can't get them to be anything more than lukewarm. I've tried shaking, covering, letting them stay out, etc. I wish I knew what the magic was to using them but I'm afraid that I've given up and will go back to my reusable microwave packs."
354450,2,Decent basic skirt if you like a little bit dowdy with shiny fabric. True to size is about the best I can say.
345546,0,"I purchase the 4""x4"" Dry-Pack. It works reasonably well provided the seals are kept free of sand etc.The design with a clamp is not as compact nor reliable as other packs I have which feature a ""roll-down"" style top. They are not as susceptible to dirt etc. in the sealing mechanism.In addition, the plastic used is not as rugged as others.I suggest you look around at other brands before making a decision."
77475,0,"We bought this table because we wanted a larger than the 40"" squares. This table was delivered as promised and it does work as a picnic table large enough to set the grill on, yet still seat 4 of us. It looks nice set up for use. Construction quality is marginal and not sturdy in my opinion considering the cost. It is simple to set up and use, but i don't think there were instructions. The top slats are held together with cloth encased rubber bands that i hope will not get worn with use too soon. Each slat has a fitted end cap. two of mine are missing already as they don't fit snugly. Folding the legs has to be done in the right order or they don't fit in the bag, but it's not obvious which legs to go in first. due to the construction, i'm concerned how many times this thing can be folded before it breaks. at this cost, i might be inclined next time to look at a physical store first to see better how it's constructed. we live in our motorcoach and i was willing to pay for something that would last. i'm not sure this was it."
4015,2,"Ordered this for my husbands birthday because I really liked the idea of the putt return. Received the item, and the mechanism just clicks. We followed the directions and sent a second ball down and tried rearranging it, but still didn't work. Called customer service to try to get an exchange, but of six phone calls (and leaving messages) was only able to reach one person who said they'd get back to me within the hour...it's now been 3 days and I still can't get a hold of anyone. I will now return this and not get an exchange just in case something happens with the next one...that is if I can get a hold of someone!"

71517,0,"Great so far, only about 50 miles of riding. I ride a tandem and had to mount the bracket about half way up on the stoker seatpost but the rubber coating on the loop sticks well. Rear rack is very stable with this setup. The small pad between the C bracket and the seatpost slips off and leaves a gooey residue, but not a huge issue. Overall very good, and if it holds up and doesn't break I would give it four stars. It's a bummer paying more in shipping than the item cost, but I couldn't even find a bike shop that knew what a mono-stay adapter is, never mind actually selling it."
347273,0,"Pros: Fairly light weight means my two young sons are able to fold it up/lower it down with relative ease. I actually found the assembly to be rather straight forward (with the caveat in cons below) although having two people definitely made it go faster. Like the paddle and ball storage feature. While you're definitely paying a premium for the Butterfly name, all in all I'm very happy with the purchase.Cons: The starter holes that were drilled were not properly offset which meant that when the table was ultimately assembled the lines on the table did not line up (they were off by a good half inch). Which meant that I had to redrill the holes in the table and some of the metal components. This easily added 1 - 1.5 hours to the assembly process. Comes with a net, which I did not expect. While I like the ball and paddle holder that comes with the table, it is designed in such a way that adding an upgraded net and post may not be possible. In fact, I bought a Butterfly net and post set that will not work with this table."

462648,2,"I bought this knife based on all the good reviews it received. The knife I received was difficult to open. The spring assist was extremely tight which made the knife feel unsafe. The safety button, which must be pushed up to fold the knife, would lock up and require two hands to disengage. The Gerber Fast Draw was neither smooth nor fast. The vast majority of the reviews of this knife on youtube are of a different version. The current production knife does not have a notch on the back of the knife to allow for index finger deployment. Previous production lots may have deserved such rave reviews but the knife I received in September 2010 definitely does not."
55819,1,"I purchased this for my 3 year old daughter and, to my surprise, she actually doesnt mind wearing the helmet. It is lightweight and breathes well. The protective pads aren't that great.

173215,1,"I just got one of these. I went fishing on Friday and caught no less than 30 fish ranging from Large Mouth Bass to Rainbow and Brown Trout and some Pumpkin Seeds. I must have missed 100 more as I learned how to fish it. And I thought this creek only had Browns and some chub.Today I brought my five year old out to the same spot and he managed to catch four fish on it - his first (6) fish ever. Large Mouth and Rock Bass.Easy to fish. And fish seem to love it. Great for UL. I used a 6'-6""UL with 2# test. Makes a 4# large mouth and a 20"" rainbow feel huge!"

328373,1,"Just a note on the quality and looks of this model. I bought it for my 11 yr/old son from Amazon as he liked ship models and I thought this would blow his mind, size and all. Boy was I mistaken. He loved it but it's complicated and beyond his level. It now rests in the closet until his skills catch up. By chance I was visiting a senior retirement community and spotted this model in a plexiglass case displayed in one of the side rooms. It was beautiful,painted to detail and rigged w/o the sails. I tracked the builder,resident,down who had donated it to the facility and ask how long it had taken to assemble. ""1000 hours"" he estimated and ""I've been building these all my life"". This is a heads up on this models'construction and with patience it's a show piece."

394787,0,"This is a super idea and a lot of fun but there are a few drawbacks. It takes 15 minutes in 2 intervals to roll the thing, and time seems to pass slowly on that second pass. I did it with 3 children, and all of our attention spans waned. And unless you really keep the momentum going, it doesn't freeze all the way so you have to eat runny ice cream or roll for a bit longer. The ball itself is also very hard so you have to be careful if you are doing this with kids. But all the flavors you can create are a lot of fun, and it's a great concept."
74645,0,"I am new to biking and decided I needed a sleeveless jersey for hot days. I picked this one mainly based on price and function (zipper pocket), but it also has somewhat of a stylish look. When it arrived, the fabric was much ""scratchier"" than I expected and there are only three pockets, not four as advertised, none of which have the advertised zipper. I think it is just ok, but I will be spending more money on a better brand for the feel and hopefully the advertised features. Also, fit is a bit snug. I got an XL and I wear an 8-10 women's size in regular clothes. I know biking gear is supposed to be sleek, but I like a bit more room and I am not worried about drag (I'm not going fast enough to worry about that...yet!) Just an ok jersey. I think I was also charged $17 in shipping and it was sent in one of those US mail one price envelopes - just a little sketchy. I don't mind paying such fees, but let's be reasonable..."
290848,1,"Bought this scope as a fathers day present for my dad's savage mkII. Zeroing was done within 10 mins and we spent the next hour or so shooting coke bottles anywhere from 25 to 125 yards.

One has to really move the dail up-down to read the time properly.But overall the watch is good. It has many options and finally the bottom line my wife loved it...so even I am happy."
235542,0,"Great material - hard polymer/plastic like mold that makes it durable. Gun fits very snug but still allows it to draw easily. The downfall is that on this particular model (belt holster) not the paddle, the belt loop opening is very small and does not fit most of my belts. I have to use a slimmer belt. If I had the chance I would have picked the paddle!"

223677,2,"Recently purchased this, knowing that some custum dremmeling would be necessary to get the right fit. But Once it arrived I realized what was on the box and wasn't advertised on Amazon. This is specifically designed for AK47's and AK reciever type frames. Although with enough cutting, sawing, dremmeling, sanding, etc you can get it o fit your Fpk/Psl.... kinda. I would definitly not recommend this to anyone who wants it for their Drag. But for AK's, seems like it should be fine."
324298,0,"Bought this for Christmas for my 7-1/2 yrs old. He was really excited and couldn't wait to hop on, unfortunately he ended in a really big crash. It's extremely hard and as soon as you step on you're falling right off again. It's very important to read the manual and to view the riding tips DVD before starting. It now lives in a closet and my son has no interest in it. Maybe when he's 10."
501863,1,"My wife and I purchased the Smooth CE 3.2 back in March of 2006. We have been using it each 3 to 4 times a week for 1/2 hour workouts. Works great and we have had no problems. The foot platforms had begun to squeak after a few months, but some lubrication cleared it right up. Nothing squeaks on it now. The action is smooth through all resistance ranges, and we are definately glad we purchased it. However, that is not to say that I don't have some complaints: I wish the stride were a little longer. My wife and I are pretty short (both around 5'6'') and we both think the stride isn't long enough. Also, the heart rate on the computer takes about 30 seconds to spool up and accurately read your heart rate once you grab the sensors. Finally, you get a water bottle, but no place to attach it to the machine. These are my biggest gripes, however, the build quality, and the exercise action are so far superior to the other $1200 or less elliptical machines (Sears, Wlamart, etc.) that I can forgive these small grievances. In summation, if your not into gimmicks, and want a machine that will last a ling time, under hard use, day in and day out, buy the Smooth."
502052,1,A good lunch cooler. Pleanty roomy. It is nice to have two sections to divide the food. Priced reasonably.
205022,2,I bought this jersey because I liked the color. Later on I found out it is the jersey that represents Eli Manning of the New York Giants. I can't stand the guy. He's such a tool. I can't believe this is his jersey. I wore it to the bar and everyone called me a loser. I couldn't return it because I got cheese on it. What a debacle.
38387,2,"I'm a bit disappointed with this purchase. I bought 3 size 5 balls on 9/20/08 specifically to use during my daughter's home soccer games. One ball for the field and one ball placed at each goal. During the game, the players noticed the ball kind of wobbled when it was kicked. Our coach asked where I bought them, later told me these balls were the cheapest in the market, and soon would breakdown. I stored the soccer balls in my garage and used it about 2 weeks later. All the balls were flat and needed to be pumped. I was kind of surprise of the quality and even more so, embarrassed to use these balls for our games. I'll eat this loss but, why should you? Keep shopping."

It was only 2 yrs. old at that time."

I don't think it keeps things cold/ice frozen any longer than normal coolers like it claims; so if it's more expensive than other coolers the same size, I'd say go with whatever's cheapest. Also - it doesn't have a drainage spout, which would have been convenient. I honestly won't use this too often. I needed it for a one-time camping trip and it has now served it's purpose."
119584,1,"I've had this watch for about 5 years and it is by far the best watch I've owned. I had a Rolex Sea Dweller prior to this purchase and I stopped wearing the Sea Dweller and sold it because I liked this watch better...not to mention the Sea Dweller was a bit too flashy for me. This watch is heavy, but that I like. I've worn it scuba diving on about 100+ dives without an issue. You can't go wrong with this watch."

489758,0,"For the past several years, Sega's NBA 2K series has been the champion of basketball video games while EA Sports' NBA Live series seemed on a path to self-destruction. However, just when Sega seemed ready do solidify NBA 2K3 as the undisputed heavyweight champion, it takes a a big step in the WRONG direction. Meanwhile, NBA Live 2003 is a solid rebound for a struggling series.I've been playing basketball video games for over 20 years, dating back to the ATARI 2600 but I truly believe that NBA 2K1 on the Dreamcast and NBA 2K2 for the PS2 are two of the best basketball games EVER!! I was so impressed with the last two titles that I went out and bought NBA 2K3 on the first day it was released. Before getting home and ripping open the package, I overheard some bad reviews about the game. So, to be safe, I went out and rented both NBA Live 2003 and NBA 2K3 to see for myself. NBA Live 2003 is actually better! Sure, the gameplay of Live 2003 is a bit too fast, but the rest of the game was tight enough to overlook it. NBA 2K3 is quite the opposite: the gameplay is much too slow. The worst part of the game is the passing. Passes are no longer quick and crisp. Instead, they float across the court like balloons waiting to get picked off by a defender. It gets very frustrating to miss out on fast-break opportunities because a slow lob-pass allowed the defense to get back when a normal pass would have been better. This happens far too often and, apparently, can't be controlled. Overall, the graphics and features of NBA 2K3 remain top-notch but the gameplay is lacking. The fast-pace of NBA Live 2003 makes the game much more fun. Next time, Sega, ""If it aint broke, don't fix it"". I took NBA 2K3 back to the store and exchanged it for NBA Live 2003 without looking back!"

70400,0,"I honestly don't know much about the history of this sword and the internet is rather vague about it, but what I can tell you is that the design is from Kit Rae, who has also made many other fantasy-sword designs. There is also a painting called ""Vaelen confronts Darkness"" but whether the painting inspired the design of the sword or vice versa is hard to tell.The number one thing to keep in mind is that this is just a decorative sword--hang it on your wall, step back and impress your friends with it. The design itself is really good, in my opinion, if you prefer a more fantasy-look to your swords.This sword is not ever meant for cutting things! It's a dull blade to begin with and even if you sharpened it, I still wouldn't use it! Seriously!One needs to keep in mind that there are official Kit Rae swords and then there are imitation Kit Rae swords. From the research I've done, the real Kit Rae swords have the Kit Rae logo just above the hand-guard (lowest part of the blade itself). Personally, mine's an imitation, but it still looks impressive. But since it is a decorative sword the blade will wiggle in the handle quite a bit because the blade is not properly secured by a Medugi or anything--the main reason you'd never swing this blade around.The weight is reasonable. Heavier than a real sword should be, but even holding it with one hand is not uncomfortable.The blade itself is not a mirror finish and the handle is . . . probably plastic-something or some cheap metal with paint put over it.If you want to see some REAL good swords, check out the Paul Chen line of Katanas, Bugei, and Raven Armoury (among other things, they make really wicked-looking scimitars!)"

Learn from my mistake, DO NOT BUY."
361892,0,"Up until about 2 months ago I hadnt even swung a square driver and I'll have to say that it does offer benefits. With it's square shape it allows for the weight of the club head to be evenly dispursed to the face without adding weights or any head adjustments. I actually bought the club at a local sporting goods store for an even better bargain than here but I know I got lucky. I would say the price is worth the experiment of seeing if the ""square"" technology is something you like. It DOES work, though I'm sure that the more you spend on this type of club the better....like any other club i guess. The one problem I do have is the shaft, it's available in senior and regular here and coincidentally same at the store i bought it at. With my clubhead speed neither of these shafts is right for me (the brand is great though, I own other clubs with same brand shafts). Its flex allows the clubhead to ""lag"" behind my hands so much that when it finally catches up my hands are starting my follow through and the clubhead is no longer square causing slices or unwanted draws. It forces me to slow my swing and lose yardage. I recommend the shafts available here to someone with a slower swing. And for you fast hands, if you can find this club at the same price with a stiffer shaft, BUY IT..try it. Youll probably like it. Oh and one last thing....like all metals, titanium has different grades. This could be where the price break comes from. I noticed that the sound of the club compared to other Ti drivers I own was much hollower and muffled sounding as opposed to the ""ping"" sound I get from my taylormade R7. Overall worth it."
393519,1,Thank you for sending my order so quickly. The swords came well packaged and undamaged. We were happy to get to use them immediately.
251507,0,"I bought this for my six year old because it reminded me of my childhood playing in the backyard of my grandmother's house with my cousins. The mallets need to be put together, but it is very easy. The thing I like least is that you need to unscrew the mallets every time in order to fit them into the bag that comes with it :( I just found another bag to put everything in. She had some trouble hitting the ball at first, but with practice got the swing of it very quickly. Warning: the mallets are probably heavy enough to give a concussion, so I stand clear of her as she swings because small children do not have the control to hit without pulling back far. We even played it on a hot day with the sprinkler on to keep us cool and not a problem for a small amount of water on the wood."
34471,2,"Kudos once again to Amazon and its community of vendors for great packing and speedy shipping.Sadly, the product is just so-so and were it not for an immediate need I would quickly return it. First of all, while the product is well made and nice looking, it is heavy; however, I expected that. What bugs me is that the quick release (QR) mechanism is klunky and difficult to operate. Although it is faster to use than the original 4-bolt clasp model of this product, it is NOT a very fast QR. A lot of fiddling around is required to mount the rack securely on the seat post, and just about as much is required to unmount it. If you have a loaded pack already attached to the rack, it's going to be a 2-person effort to get the rack and pack attached to your seat post! Worse, the mechanism has some serious metal teeth or grippers on the inside of the QR clasps and they slightly marred my alloy seat post under light pressure! I can only imagine what the damage might have been had I clamped down as hard as would be necessary for normal use. Although I am not sure this will work, I intend to get some neoprene or other thin cushioning to glue over the grippers to try to prevent further damage.Buyers of this product... if you get one of these things, consider using it with an old seat post!"

102357,1,I save this just for bike work so that the tools stay in tact for when I really need them. Bringing them on vacation is key. Following great tradition of Alien tools this item provides all one needs for typical maintenance and repair of bicycles in amazingly small form. I have used the original Alien tool for years and this one adds more useful features in the same format.My only complaint vs. the original tool is air-travel related. Original Alien tool didn't have any parts that could be interpreted as a thing other than a tool and it was easy to carry it on air flights. Couple of knife-like implements are good functional add-ons but cause this issue...

Noisy brakes also. Left pedal crank shaft keeps loosening and falling off. Tried to give the bike a chance, but should have returned immediately. Now it's too late. I wouldn't recommend this bike."

319326,1,"The 532 Ride-On Adapter is easy to install and made an inexpensive way to adapt older Thule bike trays to my 2012 Subaru Impreza factory crossbars. The 32 inch Thule bars that came with the 532 were too short so I substituted some 50 inch bars I had to enable me to mount the bike trays outside the stanchions and kayak stands in the middle. Caution: I would not carry two kayaks and two bikes at the same time, as this would overweight the factory bars."
411641,1,"You get what you pay for! It doesn't have weights but rather uses your own body weight and rubber strings. If you're determined to work out, then this is a great way to get started for cheap.My only gripes with this is that you can't do some of the exercises unless you're already strong and there's no way to lower the ""weight"" (since you are the weight technically)."
104096,1,"Very handy item especially if you build your own fresh or saltwater leaders. Also handy if you need to repair a leader on the water, after a fish broke you off, and you need to know what size leader material to tie back on. Very well built and available in numerous brite colours to aid in finding it should you and it become seperated. The predrilled hole in the Gage is designed to make attaching it to a zinger easy. Use this feature and the chance of losing it in the water is greatly reduced. A very durable, quality product from fishpond."

202469,0,"I tried a few other rowing machine before this purchase. I rate this rowing machine as barely average, rowing machine alone 6 out of 10 because I like the seating and overall study structure. Rowing handle could be longer.- The computer is cheap with no programing option or upgrade from manufacturer, I give this 4 out of 10- The rowing machine foot rest was made for someone with foot size-9 and not larger. The strap does not secure properly and some what uncomfortable. In summary the foot guard for rowing machine is 2 out of 10.I like the bike and rate it 8 out of 10. The seat is comfortable, again the foot guard is poor.- The foot strap/guard could be better, I rate this as 4 out of 10.Summary: I like it, for $499 this product is average. I hope the manufacturer looks to improve and offer interchangeable parts and computer."

401122,0,"I now realize why I dislike plastic (Kydex?) holsters!! I bought this Fobus C-21 paddle holster for one reason and one reason only: to act as a stop-gap measure until my Mitch Rosen 5JR Pres holster arrived in a few weeks. I needed an inexpensive retention holster in a hurry to begin carrying my new 1911A1 which replaced my Smith Bodyguard .38 Special.The holster arrived a full day ahead of schedule (Way to go AMAZON!!!) I immediately removed it from the packing and placed my 1911A1 stock GI model .45 ACP into the holster and it fit GREAT! UNFORTUNATELY, removing it from the C-21 holster was a bit more problematic. This holster holds the weapon very, VERY tightly. Way too tight to be an effective holster for CQB. Trying to present this weapon using this holster with a one-handed draw is damned near impossible!This particular Fobus holster is NOT adjustable. Therefore, I was stuck trying to find a way to loosen the clam shells to provide a better way to present the weapon. I finally settled on the idea of taking a standard, straight blade screwdriver and inserting it above the rivet on the trigger guard side of the holster and twisting the screwdriver 90 degrees to force some space between the clam shells and loosen the grip of the holster on the weapon. It took about four (4) attempts to finally get enough play in the rivet to allow me to draw the 1911 without pulling the entire holster out of my pants!This is NOT a one-handed draw holster. Even with the additional reduction of retention in the clam shells, I still need to take my left hand and stabilize the holster while drawing the weapon with my right hand. This is not a good situation when you need to draw and present the weapon in a positive, rapid manner. I realize that Fobus makes an adjustable plastic holster for the 1911A1, however, I didn't feel like spending the additional money for a holster I would only be using for a short period of time.Would I recommend this holster to my fellow shooters? Yes, with the following caveat: While this holster is inexpensive and it does hold the weapon very securely, you may want to spend the extra money to get the adjustable version as without some modification, this holster will not let you draw and present the weapon in a rapid manner."
38141,0,"I like the cut of the vest and the cattail color is pretty well represented on my monitor - maybe more of a rich brown than the rich maroon-brown I saw, by a slight margin. There's some reddishness. As many others noted it's a thin fleece, so it might not be the best value for the $30 I paid in my size. Whether that thinness becomes a longevity issue or not I'll have to see."
65845,0,"The reel performs fine except that is right hand retrieve only. Since I cast, both fly and bait, with my right hand and retrieve left handed, this reel makes it very difficult.

424735,0,"I was looking forward to receiving the Festina sub diver. The sub diver is my choice for a nice, rugged, sporty summer watch for all types of activities including water sports. I already own the Festina Tour de France model and so have no qualms about quality, workmanship, and reliability of these watches.I had been considering this purchase for quite a while and finally decided to buy it. My choices were limited in terms of merchants willing to ship to Canada via USPS, in fact I couldn't find one on Amazon that would ship regular mail. So I went ahead and ordered through Ewatches (on Amazon) using UPS, knowing I would pay a broker charge at the border.The watch was received promptly within a week or so, so no complaints on the delivery side and I absorbed an $18 broker charge at the Canadian border on top of the shipping and the price of the watch.Upon opening the package I noticed the watch wasn't working. I inspected the crown assuming it had simply been pulled out to save battery power during shipping, but no, the crown was in and to my dismay the battery was dead! I went through the rest of the packaging trying to hunt down an owner's manual, and there wasn't any. That was the only thing missing.So I went out of my way to have a new battery installed and the local jewelers asked me if this was a new watch, I responded, 'Yes'. They were amazed.So long story short, I was disappointed, but I like the watch it works well and Ewatches was good enough to apologize, refund me $10 for the dead battery and a new manual is on the way.Update July 17th, 2009-Still haven't received the owner's manual as promised by the vendor.-Watch is working well."
124798,1,"This chain cleaner is definitely very efficient when it comes to cleaning your chain, and it seems very durable. Some reviewers noted that it breaks when dropped. I can't imagine it doing so, but I'm careful with it nonetheless. After use this tool leaves your chain looking brand new. All you need to do at that point is very thoroughly remove the cleaner residue with a dry rag and lubricate the chain. At that point you may as well clean your cassette and crank. I've used this tool on five bikes and I haven't noticed any wear on the removable bristles inside. However, when wear does occur, every moving part in this tool can be replace. This is a plus for me, as I would rather not buy the whole tool again.The only downside is the cleaning solution itself. This first time around I purchased my cleaner from park tools. However, even though it works fine I'd like to find a cheaper alternative.All in all this tool beets using old rags or tooth brushes when cleaning your chain, and I would definitely recommend it."

385215,0,"**Update**We had these almost 2 years before we had to get rid of them due to leaking issues. The leaks first came to our attention when my husband had to take a long car ride with 2 of his bosses to an important meeting, so he brought his latte in his thermos for the car ride. They'd left early in the morning so it was dark outside for the entire drive. They arrived at the meeting and that's when my husband noticed latte drips on his shirt. Yikes. He said he was absolutely sure he hadn't filled the thermos anywhere close to the fill line, and just to check, I filled the thermos to an inch below the fill line with milk. Went to take a drink from it and sure enough, milk dripped down onto my shirt. Not sure what caused this, we always handwashed them. They won't always stay leakproof, it seems.*Original review*We have two of these Thermos bottles... one in the brown espresso, and the other silver. I first bought one because I'll spend a few hours running around town doing errands, and wanted to have water kept cold in the car, even on a hot day. This thermos fits the bill. My husband borrowed mine one day so he could take his latte to work with him, and he liked it so much I had to get another.Pros:1) Ice water will still have big chunks of ice hours later, barely melted.2) My husband's latte will be hot hours later.... not lukewarm, but hot.3) I can open it and close it with one hand while driving.4) Lid has a handy spring on it to keep it open so it doesn't slam down into my face when I tilt the bottle to take a drink.5) The lid has a white partition with a hole in it so the liquid comes out at reasonable rate... the ice or liquid in the thermos won't suddenly all slosh in your face.6) Lid has a nice drinking lip, it makes it feel like drinking from a regular glass.7) Lid has a locking latch so that the push button isn't accidentally pushed and opened. My husband will have this thermos rolling around in the trunk of his motorcycle for his morning commute, and it has never accidentally opened or leaked.8) It doesn't leak as long as you don't fill it past the ring inside the thermos... it's an inch or so below the actual rim.9) Easy to clean, no moving parts for latte milk to get trapped in (ew!).Cons:None really. I'll update should something come to our attention.It's a great item, well designed, and it gets a lot of use in our house. We've had these over 6 months and highly recommend them."

It folds easily so I can carry it to class, and I don't have to worry about locking it up. The agility of it is perfect for navigating busy sidewalks. The noise it makes going over the side walk cracks is usually loud enough so that people hear you and move.

I'm still happy I purchased this item, but it is tissue thin.If you're looking for a really thin gi jacket (for say, summer), I'd recommend this one. I would not say it would last 30 seconds at Judo as tt doesn't seem to be built to take punishment. As a light weave that is to be expected, but when this takes ""light"" to a new meaning...So far it has survived a couple washings (and a little abuse, so it isn't completely fragile) and it makes a nice break when my main gi is a little too ""fragrant"" to wear between laundry days, but I wouldn't recommend this one as a replacement for a heavier weave top!"

My car is running great and am hopeful about the other two bottles I have as one is going in my fathers truck he left me and the other I'm saving for when/if it's really needed.

78540,1,"I got turned onto this line 5-6 years ago by one of my fly fishing buddies. He had been using the 4 lb. line as tippet material. I was using monofilament and was experiencing numerous snap-offs and and know failures to large trout. I bought my first spool of the Vanish line and witnessed my catch rates double, if not triple. Snap-offs and knot failures became nearly non-existent, and the number of takes I received increased dramatically due to this line's underwater invisibility. It is more durable and lasts longer than any mono I've previously used. I've since taken to spooling all of my ice fishing rods with 4 lb. and 6 lb. Vanish. Fish can drag this line all over the holes edges without damaging it. Knot strength is ridiculous. I haven't had any problems with excessive memory and coiling, possibly because I'm using the lighter test. It costs more than average mono but the benefits are worth it, IMO. I'll never use mono again!"
317835,2,"I've been working on bicycles for twenty years and I've only ever had one tire blow off the rim after I installed it. That is, until I bought these.They were for my wife's bike which has Campy Scirocco 20 spoke deep-dish rims. I normally ride Vittoria but thought I would give Maxxis a try. This was a bad idea. The first tire blew off the rim as I was inflating it even though I inspected the tire for correct seating prior to inflating. OK, I thought, it's happened once before.So I grabbed a second new inner tube and installed it. I partially inflated the tube and deflated it twice before taking it up to 100psi. The tire was perfectly seated. However it blew off the rim 15 minutes later. Fortunately I had a large supply of spare tubes.I grabbed yet another tube and installed it with even more care. It lasted two hours before it also blew off the rim. The tire is being returned and I'm shopping for Vittoria folding tires and three new inner tubes.When I look really closely at the tire I can see the bead is deformed right under the 'Detonator' logo. How ironic is that?I'll never buy Maxxis again. When I factor in the cost of the blown tubes they're too expensive."

In fact, the emergency whistle that came with my Gerber/Bear Grylls fire starter, which I didn't even realize was included with that product, is louder.On the plus side, its one-piece construction probably means it'll hold up well in harsh conditions and its orange color might prevent you from losing it.It's not too expensive, but I'm still not sure I feel this product's worth the price."

I received them in a heather grey colour, even though the packaging still says ""Oxford"". So BEWARE! I don't know if it is a photo error or a packaging error; either way, not worth the postage to return it2. they are small but NOT THAT SMALL! I read the reviews extensively before finally buying them. Previously, someone reviewed saying that she's an S-M and a XL would fit perfectly - which is what I bought. But both pairs arrived amazingly big. I think my boyfriend can wear them! I folded the waistband (note: elastic band, not strings) down twice and the shorts are still too long and too baggy and make my butt look 50% bigger. I'm a size 4 or 6 (ie S or M), and if I were to buy again, I would get size M, or at most L. So be careful when you up the sizes!Unfortunately these were not a good buy for me. I gave it 3 stars, however, because I think if you were lucky enough to get the right size and colour, they would be pretty good and they seem very comfortable."

Essentially, each revolution was pushing the glass further towards the tube and due to the conditions, I had to ride a mile or so like this.

Finally, the cap has to be on the bottle to come close to a watertight seal -- which it's not. Definitely not a one-handed hydration option for exercisers! Not bad, but certainly not what I anticipated!"
2771,1,"After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing. Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com. I'm 6'6 and 220lbs, broad shouldered, lean and decently well muscled(working to gain). Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with (alot) of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back. The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight. The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both. I have not done any training in the shirt so cannot at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking, energy level/recovery from compression or chafing. I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training. I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T's. Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success."

449328,1,"The No. 1 is a definite step up from the CoC trainer gripper. I originally got the trainer because my forearms would tire out too soon on my back workout days, but now that isn't a problem. I could close the trainer quite easily, but the No. 1 is a whole other story. I could not close it all the way for the first couple of weeks. I've been surprised how quickly my grip strength has come along. It has been fun having them both around work and challenging the other guys to use them and for the price they are as solidly built as anything you will find."
264568,2,"This was not the item I received from the company. Different colors and make. Besides that it is a SUBPAR release, and much too large for even a big guy like me, 6'1, 200lbs with larger hands. I would only advise you to buy it if you cant afford anything better or if you HAVE HUGE HANDS!! Tsk tsk sportmans guide you let me down on this one."

219841,2,"I ordered this jersey and got a quick confirmation from Fansedge. Their motto is ""You order today, we ship today."" They charged my credit card immediately. Four days later I called to check status and was told that it was backordered for at least another six days. I cancelled the order and am now waiting for my refund.Ethical vendors let you know if a product is in backorder status before you place the order. Ethical vendors do not charge your account until they ship. Avoid Fansedge!"
336592,0,Good sharp knife but ..... Had this knife for 2 months and lost it due to the poor quality of the pocket clip. It is not springy enough to take the daily abuse. It took about 2 weeks for it to lose enough spring so that it would fall out of my jeans pocket. Now it is gone and I will not be buying a Gerber to replace it!10/15/2010 Have a Spyderco for the last 6 months and the pocket clip is still as good as new!
313318,1,Excellent quality buoy and made in the USA. I purchased two of these last year for crabbing and they are great.

273955,1,"This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear. Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts. When zipped, it's just right for those 45-50 degree days (as long as you're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store, or short walks). It's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs. My only disappointment is the main zipper. Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started, and it often sticks mid-zip (as if there was grit or something in it). It always ends up working, but not always smoothly. I'd definitely recommend the vest, and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw, but rather a production glitch, which would not likely affect other buyers."
185795,1,"I'm able to take two bikes on the back of my Camry with no problems. While the directions were not that good, it was fairly intuitive to setup. I might have spent maybe 5 minutes getting it setup right."
75769,0,"This is a pretty decent shirt just be aware it is cotton so it will tend to shrink in the wash just something to consider when ordering for size. I am a pretty big guy at 6' 280lbs. not in a round sense but length wise and it's kinda hard for me to find XL shirts that fit me in length as well as width (im kinda chesty too) and these shirts are good for that, the neck is kinda tight for me but that just might be me, anyways all in all these shirts are good for hitting the gym or just being lazy at home. Good price but if your skeptical order one and see how you like it."
344852,0,"This portable backboard system seems to be a good value for the money, and is great for young beginners, especially because it is adjustable. With free shipping from Amazon, it was a great value."
47243,0,The good - Quality materials went into this hat.The bad - Unfortunately this is not for all seasons.The ugly - The head liner is too warm for summer use. I'm left wondering how I can remove it and install a mesh to release some heat from my hot head.
272172,0,"I own several Russell t-shirts that are about 10 years old. They are heavy cotton and even 10 years later...still are holding up well. I got this one today and the cotton is probably 50% of what it used to be. You can almost see through it compared to the old Russell shirts. I think that a Beefy T-shirt is thicker. Disappointing for what they used to be. If you don't mind a thinner cotton shirt, this one is good."
315517,1,"these set of pants are really well built, they are comfortable and are easy to move in which is really important for martial arts clothes"
144912,0,Switched to this grip about 6 month ago because they were slightly cheaper than the Wilson over grips. The feel and quality are very similar to the Wilson. I like the product and would order again.
443487,0,The bottle works better than a normal water bottle but still requires you to freeze about one third the volume to make it last a couple of hours in 85 degree weather.
166807,1,Just got this in and It really is a great high quality polo shirt. It is a true black color not some off faded black that some places consider black. The fit for me is just a tad too large to what I like them but that's what happens when you're tall and in between the medium and large chest wise. I have a feeling I will be ordering more of these in the future.
294788,2,"Sadly, i was not at all satisfied with the Thermarest Compressible Pillow. First of all the product arrived in the shipping box with no wrapping, who knows wheres its been dropped or dragged. Second, after unrolling it, it didnt fluff up at all. I had to shake it and beat to get it to fluff up about half way. It feels like its stuffed with packing peanuts. I could immediately tell that it would not be good for me for a comfortable nights sleep."
394731,0,It kept me warm but fell apart after I washed it for the first time.
384200,0,The fit and comfort of the product is very good. The color fade was more than I thought it should be in a short period of time.
374208,0,"It's hard not to like this monocular, you will not find a smaller, lighter monocular on the market. Unfortunately, image quality is just fair. I tried about a dozen different monoculars looking for the ideal one, and this one just wasn't it for me.If size and weight are the most important factors for you, then this is by far the best choice. With it's pen clip you can easily carry this in a shirt pocket. It's just a little bigger in diameter than a ball point pen, and about the same weight. It's also easy to focus.While there is nothing bad about the image quality, it's nothing special either. I could honestly make out distant objects at the same resolution with an $18 Carson 7 x 18 monocular.A good alternative to this model would be theNikon 6x15 Monocular II. While it's certainly bulkier than the Zeiss, it will still slip very easily into a shirt pocket and is still relatively light. The Nikon offers vastly superior image quality in my opinion."
370158,1,"This knife is small and light enough to carry it everyday around you neck with provided chain, yet its triangular cross-section(more like a pick) makes the knife sturdy, and its edge and point are quite sharp.My only complaint: I found out that the mouth of sheath was slightly damaged for some reason when I received the knife, possibly a manufacturing defect. However, since the damage was a slight one and was not the kind affecting performance, I decided to keep it."
253602,0,Not happy with the thickness ... Used to be more beefed up. Grayish blue shirt was itchy even after washing. The grey's usually have some other material in them??
473242,0,They do help some. They are comfortable. If your hands get really cold and you are looking for something to keep them warm these are not the fix. In such case they are more likely to change your cold numb hands to cold hands.
231783,1,"One of the better designed such tools I've seen. Compact and efficient. I've even used the chain riveter. Lightweight, portable and very useful for the money.Happy riding!"
95849,1,I ran a half marathon and used this product. It was perfect. I didn't have to stop at the water stations and instead could keep running straight through. My hand didnt even feel like it was holding a water bottle. The pouch in front was great to hold my energy chews. I would highly recommend using one of these water bottle holders when running long distance.
65831,0,"For something this small and packable, it should be alot finer. It's too coarse for any knife I have unless I need to take out nicks in the edge of an ax."
221234,0,"First, it works fine and the remote is a nice feature when going to bed. The light does not slide on the tent wall, though it is a bit heavy, caused by the 6 AA batteries. It could be brighter too. The flat reflective surface is white with no focal point. It uses an incandescent bulb which drains the batteries much faster than a florescent, or the new bright LED lamps. But it works well as a momentary light used to keep you from falling over your gear when going to bed. But if you're looking for a good reading light, you'd be better off with a battery powered clip-on book light. - HRB"
276710,1,"I normally get Under Armour spandex (which can be about $25 a pair) but this was really nice! I love the cut, and the texture is nice as well. The actual color has more of a tint of bright coral, but I like it like that. I'll be getting more mizuno spandex in the future!"
114689,0,"These are cut a little big, and that's pretty typical for a rain jacket. It feels rubberized to the touch, and does keep you very dry. There are air vents under the armpits small enough that they should't let water in-- great feature. There are also two huge pockets on the front to keep items you need to keep dry.The only thing I don't like about this jacket is that it makes a lot of plastic noise. If you're out in the rain, this doesn't matter, but any time it's not raining you're going to be ""loud"".If I am going to be wearing a jacket for rain purposes I would personally prefer the Columbia Omni-tech or Titanium Tech jacket. Far more stylish, quieter, and better ventilation, at more cost."
239723,1,"Must buy fast delivery great value I play with these clubs twice a week 5 stars, highly recommend this set for all users"
476122,2,I believe they should adjust the sizing for these shirts. I ordered my true size but would probably need to order one or two sizes bigger. It was so tight I'm afraid to wash it.
9130,0,I like and use this vest but it is not my favorite. I have an LLBean vest that is warmer and better quality.
180122,0,"I bought this so my dog could help me carry things to our boat. Then I thought ""What if he falls in, loaded?"" For that reason I haven't used this item. It fits well, and might be OK if only loaded with things that float on their own, like an empty water bottle. But that doesn't reduce the weight that I have to carry."
109229,0,"I love UA products and buy only compression fit. I am a medium at 155 lbs. 5'7"". I ordered a large and it was way too tight in the armpits due to the shortness of the sleeves. Hence the reason why UA is now making them with the longer sleeves. I wish they would carry the 3/4 sleeve more."
177526,2,"This chair was very disappointing. It was uncomfortable--the support bars dig into your back, the seat is too high. In addition, the buckles on the armrests that hold the thing together when folded were broken within the first few days of use. Save money--order the lower beach chair model."
493979,1,"My husband collects Spyderco knives and this is just the right thing to keep them sharp. Easy to use and he says it works like a charm, he has sharpened everything in the house. Got a nice price - great Father's Day gift!"
292164,2,The lip of the bottle holds water which drips onto your face when you stop drinking. Very annoying. I would return the bottle if I could. I love the material and the concept but don't like the drip.
53462,2,"I used this every day and it seemed to b working great. Then about a month after I got the pedometer, it just stopped counting steps.I would have given it just one star, but like I said, it seemed to work great for the short period of time that it did work."
132543,1,I ordered this for my daughter who is just learning volleyball. She has had a great time with this quality ball.
327234,0,was hoping for something a little better like other mesh shirts as the material here is more like polyester or spandex.. but it does the job and fit well.
410477,1,We use it at Crossfit and does a good job. We like that it comes in squares vs powder. Good price also.
268355,0,"PROS: The aluminum handle is very sturdy and feels good in your hand. The blade opening mechanism works and enables you to open the knife quickly with either your left or right hand. A safety switch can lock the blade in place to prevent accidental opening. The bayonet clip rides low in your pocket so that no part of the knife is visible. The clip can also be removed and moved to the opposite side for use with your other hand.CONS: The knife is a little on the heavy side and it is also fairly thick. The clip is also very tight, when clipped to your pants it takes some effort to pull out. The length of the clip is also very short. If you have short fingers it takes a moment to properly index your thumb on the thumbstud when you draw the knife. A longer clip could help in properly positioning your thumb on the stud when you draw the knife. Finally the deployed blade can be moved slightly back and forth at the handle. That is, the width of the blade is not completely snug with the handle. I have other knives from Spyderco and Benchmade and they do not have this problem.This is a good overall utility knife but the issues I've mentioned prevent it from being an excellent knife. It would be nice if SOG offered a longer clip and if they fix the problem with the blade ""wiggle""."
78221,2,"I started spending on the bike to maintaine it since day one. I took it to the bike store when I received it to finish assembling it. Since it didn't come with any instruction's manual. After a week of using it, it started making noises and started to go out of balance. And for people that ride road bikes, they know how risky it is. I wish I spent more money and got a better bike than this shwinn Katana. Now the bike is back for the 3rd time at the bike store for maintenance. I already spent about $150 for maintenance and it's not even been a month from receiving it.I was expecting to have a manufacture warranty from Shwinn, but I never received anything with the bike that mentions that."
148614,0,"I purchased the Barnett Diablo Slingshot,The first thing i notice is the color was different then pictured,In picture and on package it looks neon green(lemon lime)when arrived it grass green.This is not good if someone puts it down in the grass,It may get lost or mowed over.I call company about this they replyed that the way it looks when the picture was taken ,Well i think not.The band on this it a bit longer which is ok if you have longer arms and it has a larger leather section that hold pellet which is nice.This Slingshot is made good and aim is good.Time will tell how long band will last."
298242,0,"My husband bought me a Columbia Fleece jacket awhile back (from Bass Pro Shop) and I wanted another one to wear around the house. When I opened this one I noticed that the fleece was alot softer and thinner. I also noticed that the Columbia logo was on the left side of the jacket and the logo on my original jacket is on the right. I don't know if that is relevant to anything, but the quality of this jacket is definately less than my original. I am not going to go through the hassle of a return because it is an okay jacket to wear around the house on chilly mornings. It came with a $50 price tag attatched and I know I would definitely not spend that much for this particular jacket."
276339,0,This is a cheap mini trampoline. You get what you pay for. That being said this is great for older kids. I got this to exercise on and I have a hard time because when you jump even lightly the legs bonce of the ground slightly. I feel like if you were going to exercise regularly on on a trampoline I would get a better quality one.
127379,0,"I purchased this mirror based on other reviews. I wouldn't say it's much better than any others out there. I do like the way you adjust the mirror. This feature is very nice. The mount is kinda funky but easy to make work with the little adapter kit for helmets. Vibration city though. I ride a recumbent road bike (Linear Limo 3.0) and noticed that every mirror I tried vibrates. It might be the 100PSI tires, it might be the weight on the end of a pendulum. If this ever breaks, I'd buy another one simply because I'm used to it."
233807,0,"Two main reasons to purchase these gloves, they are made in the usa, and they are relatively worth the money (someone of the cheapest fingerless gloves on amazon).A little big on women, but perfect for men, I got a pair for a friend and I. Will update the review once i wash and wear them..."
75091,0,My friend and I got this in hopes it would help with Airsoft. I know that sounds wierd but it does help with getting away or climbing up steep edges and even trees. But you need to sharpen the claws before you intend to actually climb a tree with them. I do reccomend getting the feet claws too because those help a lot.
318790,0,"This jacket is nice heavy and warm. However, you can not wear it with a short sleeve. The thermal lining is incredibly rough and is only comfortable with a long sleeve. The back side also rides up the back a little and is not long enough if you have a long torso."
42199,1,I just love this trike. The picture on-line does no justice for this product. If you want to buy something very unique for your little princess this is the perfect trike. My daughter just loves it as much as anyone that sees her ride it.
294231,2,"I know it's been said by other reviewers, but the cover does have a problem with vibration and shutting the unit off. I bought 2 mounts for my mountain and road bikes and both turn off almost every time I ride. It doesn't need to be a hard jolt and it seems to happen frequently on downhills when you loose the most data frantically trying to turn the thing back on without crashing. On the plus side, though, the mount does seem very sturdy and I have no fear of the GPS falling off. I just wish Garmin designed the thing better so the batteries didn't rattle around so much."
466734,0,This is a very nice jacket but runs really small. I wear a large but I like my jackets big so I can move around. I ordered a 2x and It was to small. The 2x was more like a Woman's Med. It is sort of tight in the shoulders.
238617,0,I got this bag for work to have in my car when i need to run around with a few items and have an easy way to carry them. The bag design itself is nice. The part I don't like is after a few days of constant use the zipper would skip notches and not even zip unless it was perfectly straight. Also the fabric in certain areas already started to tear. If you are looking for a cheap bag on the go this is it but if you need something a bit more sturdy this is not the bag for you.
339673,1,Love that it records seven days so can compare each day to the previous 6 and that the devise records whether it is in my pocket or at the bottom of my purse.
489807,0,"While the graphics aren't as good as you'd expect considering all the hype the Playstation 3 has received over the last several months, the actual game is pretty good. The controls in NBA 2K7 are never a major problem, and the graphics are very good. Still, the graphics aren't that much of a drastic leap forward compared to the Playstation 2 basketball games, and that probably means this game is going to be forgotten one day.Also, the music is pretty annoying (what little I've heard) but using the motion senser is a nice, innovative touch. It might take a while getting used to the controls, but one day I think we'll all improve with them.The positives are pretty good, though. If you like basketball and own a PS3, there's no reason not to own this game."
81626,2,"I am very unhappy with this watch. I bought it specifically for the calorie counter and heart rate monitor. The heart rate monitor works sometimes when I am not working out and NEVER when I am working out. When I check the heart rate it will just kick back and show me what time it is. Yeah it says to wet your fingers and try again, lower your wrist below your heart, wait 3 minutes and try again...bla bla bla. When you're at your peak you want to know where your heart rate is. Not 3 minutes later after you are cooling down. I know that I burn at least 1,300-1,500 calories during my back to back spin/strength training class and my watch states that I burn less than 1 calorie per minute?? REALLY?? Come on!! I would really like my money back. I bought it because it was inexpensive and had decent reviews, but I guess you get what you pay for sometimes?? My spin instructor bought the same watch from Amazon and she is having the same exact issues. Guess it's not just me...."
369235,0,"I've been using one of these for a couple of months now.It came with a bad connector (the old one I had was just fine and interchanged, thank you very much).But it's so slow. Compared to a handful of Coleman propane camp stoves I've had over the years, generally my only stovetop.The problem is probably not the btus it's putting out, but the heighth of the grill above the flame. This is, in turn, partly because of that wonderful (?? I don't use it, so it's not wonderful for me) folding capability. The ones on each burner have to mesh, which is probably why they are so high.It's really hard to turn down to simmer. Although, since you can hear the heat go down when you turn the second burner on, one might be able to do some regulating that way. And you can hear the difference between gas on, and gas burning.And I'd recommend a heat diffuser, especially with small pots that might be tippy. That helps a whole lot.Plus sides, in case you need something to use for tailgating, where a folding two-burner would be handy. I think you can just fold a hot stove and put it into the car.The pushbutton starter works beautifully--easy to use with one hand--turn on the gas then reach over and push the button. This has been a problem with various Colemans.Those high grills don't seem to sag (another thing that has been a problem).And it cleans easily.And, while folding may be a bit weird, doing so doesn't seem to disturb the fuel intake connection. Which really could have been a problem.I'd still like to replace it."
287186,1,Excellent choice of colors! Loved that they came in a choice of either left or right hand. Good golf glove.
426107,0,"I was surprised by this compass. I originally ordered this as an example of what ""not"" to buy when I was teaching Boy Scout leaders land navigation. I've seen many of these inexpensive compasses in the hands of young scouts and almost always the needles stick causing great frustration and leading to a lifelong hatred of map and compass work for the boys. But this compass's needle flowed pretty well. I'm not sure if I got lucky or they've improved quality control. The index line and Bezel have some space between them making it a little more difficult to read. One of my other issues is the length. This compass is too long to easily keep in a pocket so it ether is slung around the neck or kept in the pack and not used. I always recommend a compass with a hinged mirror as when folded it will fit in a shirt pocket meaning you are more likely to have it easily accessible. Also, when the mirror is folded out you have close to the length of this compass to work on maps. I gave it a 3 because the ""one"" I received was ""ok"" but this still is not my recommendation for a compass unless you are buying it just to say you have it and are not expecting to spend any time really using it."
16816,0,"Extremely well made and durable. Looks cool too. It is great on flat surfaces but it's hard to make it up a hill. Your weight is all on the back so the front wheel spins when you try to climb up slanted surface.Holding up quite well since Santa brought them to two 5 year old boys. Grandma especially likes the tall flags on the back. Since they are low to the ground, this is great for visability."
233028,1,"After struggling with heart rate monitor straps, this watch is a dream. It is so easy to use and will provide your heart rate without having to stop running.Only drawback is that numbers are a little small. But, all in all it is a great product and I highly recommend it for runners who don't want to deal with a chest strap."

412381,0,"We are still trying to get the hang of it. We can get it to come close ... but haven't mastered the angle of the trajectory to get it to come all the way back to us. It is very easy to fly, light weight and a lot of fun to practice with."
93653,0,"Package arrived on time. Item was very easy to assemble. Slant board feels a little unstable and very, very uncomfortable on the back of my legs. The pads are super thin and the width is very small. I am not a small guy though as I am 6'0"" and 210 lbs. Probably would not be bad for a 5'0"" 150 lb person."

280606,1,This Hex wrench set is a bit expensive but is a very useful wrench set. I use it for my Haso Pino tandem. It makes disassembling the Hase Pino frame and other components almost a fun. (I have the portable 4-5-6 mm wrench for carrying with me with the Hase Pino or my regular road bike.)
108620,0,"I just got this ball and, when inflated it looks good, although maybe not perfectly round at first. The pump which came with it worked, but was kind of insubstantial as far as pumps go. The hose to the pump kept falling off and I had to put it back on several times. However, the ball did inflate within 5 or 10 minutes."
489992,0,"Tiger Woods 2008 brings a few new features and updates, but not much has changed from 2007. The graphics are improved slightly from last year and it runs pretty smooth. The controls are still not as tight from earlier versions of Tiger Woods, especially starting out with a new created golfer, it's a test of patience and a lot of frustration. The putting, though, has gotten better with the new ideal putting feature. Its still Tiger and if you can hang with it, very fun as usual."
467040,0,"I ordered & returned this watch. The watch is of very good quality-but I wanted a watch with a white face but this one actually has a silver face. Thus, I returned it.The service from this seller was very, very good.Super fast shipment & willing to work with me on the return."

225796,0,"I bought this bike a year ago. It's one of two I have with the other bike being a K2 Attack 2.0 mountain bike (about 10 years old now). I ride about 1 1/2 hrs. a day for exercise. I ride mostly on pavement with an occasional brief bike trail detour. No stunts or jumps and no hard off-road riding. Bought the Jack because it has exactly what I need for urban riding & no more. I also hoped a folding bike would be easier to store & use with a car or carry on the bus. It's a no frills and very utilitarian bike. This function over form approach gives it a kind of cool look that gets an occasional compliment.It rides well enough to be tolerable but tends to squeak, twist under strain & groan more than my mountain bike does. I'm sure the folding joint in the frame is the cause. The ability to fold the frame has only made a slight positive difference in the ease of storage and moving the bike around in the car. I had thought it would make more of a difference than it has.A month ago, the heavy chrome bolt holding the seat on to the seat post broke inexplicably and without warning sending me flying into a drainage ditch. The seat wasn't loose or wobbly in advance of the break. I found the heavy steel bolt & it was snapped in half. The ridged saddle joint holding the seat on to the seat post was stripped as well. It has taken a month of emails and telephone calls to both Dahon and the retailer to get a replacement seat post sent to me under warranty. The retailer had much trouble remembering to return my phone calls & follow up on my request. Emails were usually, not always, ignored. With so much delay and avoidance from the retailer, I contacted Dahon, but they refused to even talk with me about the problem and responded with canned email messages referring me back to the non-responsive retailer. Very poor treatment by the manufacturer compared to the time my K2 frame broke in two. When the K2 frame broke after four years of use, one phone call resulted in a free replacement frame that was delivered within three days.If it weren't for the broken bolt (should never happen, given the danger)and poor manufacturer support I would have given the bike a four or five. Also, the broken heavy bolt and striped steel on the bicycle seat joint makes me worry about the basic quality of the materials used in the manufacturing of the bike. These aren't moving parts and should not break.6/28/11 Update: The WTB brand saddle broke at the 2 year 1 month point. The aluminum rail under the seat snapped. The saddle is only covered for 24 months from the date of purchase.11/16/12 Update: No additional problems with this bike. Easy to clean & easy to maintain. Other than the OEM WTB brand saddle breaking, nothing else has needed replacing. I ride this bike every day for about 1 1/2 hrs. Considering the abuse it's holding up really well."

The first time while using it, about 5-6 repetition of the excise on the screen the thing broke and we had to reknot the damn thing.Though it is pretty fun to play with someone else, the dancing game is pretty fun as is the skateboarding one. Decent game, just disappointed with the resistance band that came with it."

Took me about 15 minutes to inflate a queen size air mattress, and it didn't even inflate completely.

127235,1,"Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent product and well built. But sometimes, I think we, as consumers, get lost in the details of product without considering the biggest reason of why we buy a product. For me, at least, riding a bike on the sidewalk usually going at about 12 mph, it really isn't necessary to have a mirror. This mirror is mainly for people who stick to the roads I think, or for people who go faster than 20mph and cannot afford to turn their heads because of what may be coming at them in front is changing so fast. And yes, I commute back and forth to work almost every chance I get. But still, I found this product to be unnecessary. Even when I have it on, I still turn my head to look back. The mirror is more of a distraction. Probably just seems more intuitive to turn my head than to look at a small object in the field of view - and for me at least just as fast."

They say Charles the parts guy is in a meeting or at training...blaa blaaa blaaaa. Lies lies and more lies. Then we went camping and it leaked out the bottom after the first use over a campfire. Sent it back for a full refund by Amazon. Lot of work for myself and Amazon. Piece of junk.
280396,1,I was looking for a basketball in order to hit the court in my off time. I did some research and the reviews for this ball was great. I did the test by dropping the ball from above your head to test the pressure it should bounce to about your shoulders. Every person varies some people like the ball to bounce to their waist so all you have to do is drop it from your shoulders. You will just have to figure out what you like the best. Now I'm waiting to see if it holds up for a year before it loses air.

But if you ride at night often, or intend to keep the light longer than a year, I suggest you find a different product.I've owned brighter lights, and the thing is really cheaply made. Prior to use I often need to twist the cap on/off a few times before the electrical contacts find each other again. Sometimes it'll turn off by itself, even on fresh batteries. I think the jostling of the pavement causes this. The plastic is cheap and brittle, and I'm waiting (hoping) for it to finally break so I can buy a different one."

If you want to sit outside in the rain however you will find yourself looking for a spot where for reasons of wind direction or roof drip patterns happen to be dry.

I didn't want a really large watch because I often run or play tennis with my watch and this one is a nice balance between too big and too small. The finish of the watch and crystal is very nice and the dark background on the face looks great. It arrived in a very impressive box (would be great for a gift). I also can't believe the price (I paid less than $60). I haven't taken it diving yet, but it is rated for 200 meters depth."

302506,1,"I agree with previous reviews. You can make this as easy or as hard as you want. I am just starting week 2 and things are really beginning to happen. Sure, I flopped around on the ground like a fish when doing the Ab RipperX and Yoga, as I'm not strong enough yet for most of the moves; However, I keep on trying and my body is feeling it. My muscles are sore, but I can do a couple more reps every time I complete a session. From past experience with weight training, I know that if I keep on pushing play and giving it a whole hearted effort, I will get the results that others have successfully gotten.Don't expect miracles overnight. You have to put in the work to get the results. Don't blame the product if you don't get results when you skip a couple of sessions every week or eat whatever you want. This truly is not a beginners work out, if you are a beginner just do what you can and don't worry about the rest. It will come in time. I purchased through Amazon and all the CDs play properly. However, the little booklet that the CDs are stored in is somewhat awkward/difficult to get the DVDs out. You could potentially scratch them in the process, so be careful. Once I got them out, I stored them in their own jewel cases.5/12/10 UPDATE: The 2nd time I played the Core Synergistics DVD (which was past Amazons 30 day replacement), it quit playing properly and just freezes. How sad that the company can't produce a better quality DVD. P90X is a great product, they just need to address this issue. Several people I've talked to have the same complaint about the DVDs not working properly. I have DVD movies that I've played a million times and never have problems. Why can't P90X do the same?"

493049,1,"I'm a big fan of The FIRM DVDs, I own a few FIRM exercise dvd's in addition to other yoga & Pilates DVDs by Kathy Smith. While I've always liked Kathy Smiths workouts, I always enjoy the FIRM more.This kit includes a resistance band, & though this review is for the medium band, the kit is available to purchase with either a (pink) light, (green) medium or (purple) heavy resistance band strength. You also receive a 30 minute FIRM DVD instructional workout with an intensity level that corresponds to your whatever resistance band strength you purchased.I read several reviews & noticed a few things, 1) that many reviews were not even for this product but rather for a ballroom instruction DVD! For Shame amazon! Fix this! 2) That people are going on about how this isn't a ""proper"" Pilates workout. 3) That the resistance band is defective & broke on them.First, no this is NOT a proper Pilates workout. Yes, the workout utilizes some Pilates moves with the resistance cord, but if you actually READ the box you'd have noticed that this is a Cardio-Toning workout. So for the purists raving about how it's not true Pilates, they're right, but the kit isn't marketed as a Pilates workout.Second, both reviewers who stated that the cord snapped on them were using P90X, and in 1 instance said he was using the medium resistance band with the P90X heavy version.And they wonder why the medium resistance band broke..... This resistance band was developed for The Firm Cardio Toning workout, NOT P90X, no wonder it BROKE! My husband has been using the P90X for 2 months now & because 1) he's a male, 2) the P90X workout program is much more intense 3) looking back to #2, one would need a resistance band tailored for P90X. If the reviewers who stated the resistance band broke had been using the resistance bands designed FOR P90X, I'm pretty certain they wouldn't have had their band break. Yes, the resistance bands marketed by the FIRM are strong but they're not indestructible. Especially if you're using them with a much more intense weight training type workout. But, the FIRM resistance band is about 1/4 of the price of the P90X resistance bands on amazon so I think now we know why the reviewers purchased the FIRM band, the FIRM band/DVD $6.00 - $15.00 on Amazon, the P90X? $45.00 - 46.00 on Amazon.Sometimes it's really imperative that you purchase certain workout accessories designed FOR that workout program. Most definitely in the case of P90X which is more intense than The FIRM & more heavy on the weight training aspect. Obviously you'd need a heavy duty resistance cord for this. I know because my husband has a set of the P90X cords. They've worked flawlessly.Bottom line, use your FIRM records with the FIRM workout, you'll have no problems, try substituting the FIRM cords for the P90X cords that you NEED for P90X & yeah, the FIRM cord will eventually break. You get what you pay for but in this case a dose of common sense is crucial. I'm sorry those reviewers got hurt, but they should've bought resistance cords designed for P90X, not resistance cords designed for a daily 30 minute cardio toning workout marketed to women! It shouldn't be a shocker that the FIRM cords broke while doing a workout designed for P90X incorporating lat pulldowns with a pullup bar holding the cord in place. The cords are designed for the FIRM, NOT P90X.If your looking to try something new or in my case add in a different type of workout to a regimen you're already using, you'll like the FIRM resistance cord DVD. The workout is 30 minutes & while you won't end it sweating like crazy you WILL feel the results in your muscles that you worked. If you've never used a resistance band I'd really recommend doing the video without it a few times or strapping weights to the ankles & adding hand weights just to add some resistance to start, using a low weight amount of course.When you do add the cord be sure to start with the resistance that suits your fitness level, don't start with heavy or even medium if you've never used cords or are new to exercise, start with the light one. And as 1 other reviewer states, using flat bottomed workout shoes is not a fantastic idea. Running or athletic trainers with a textured sole area are best because the cord handle catches better in the arch of the foot & you don't worry as much about it flying off.I love The FIRM DVDs and am particularly fond of the 1's featuring Tina Smalley as instructor. I like her personality, she explains the movements, all position changes very well & she's fun to follow. I have and also enjoy Tina's FIRM sculpting ball workout as well. I do that 5X a week & add in the resistance cord DVD workout 3X a week, along with twice a week yoga. Since the FIRM DVD are only 30 minutes, their easy to add into a busy schedule and you WILL get results!"
478552,0,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not a super fit person; I am moderately fit, but I'm not like the Firm instructors!I found the Wave fun and novel, but not a great work out. I think it might be great for beginners, those who need something fun to stay motivated, and not long enough to discourage them. But if you've been using the Firm already, as I have, you may find this less-than-satisfying. I've done both the included workouts, and though I broke a sweat, I don't feel nearly as worked-out and good as I do with the Transfirmer and earlier Firm workouts. The earlier things were ""easy"" in terms of learning the moves, but you can make them harder and harder increasing the weights. These workouts, using their own cardio weights, makes it difficult to know what resistance to use, and I found that the reps were often so fast that I had to use light weights, even though I wanted more resistance.Maybe I'd feel more satisfied if the workouts were longer-- 30 minutes and 40 minutes are just not enough, unless you are an absolute beginner. Maybe I will try the other workout videos made to use the Wave.For now, I will only use this on days that I am too tired to do a regular workout, and go back to the older Firm product that maybe are a little more boring, but a whole lot more effective."

178439,1,"Best quality for price for a sweat band I have purchased. The stretchable part of the band has a wide range which springs back to it's original size without breaking the elastic. So far the quality is excellent. The amount of absorbation is very good. Actually wish I had found this product before. The only draw back I possibly could find is it may be considered a bit thick, for some. For me, a person that works in the sun all day, it is by far the best."
205739,0,"This rack handled 2 bikes perfectly for a long 12 hour ride.

Worked fine to pump out the bilge in my Alumacraft Lunker Ltd after/during a heavy rain storm. Took water down to about 1/8"" in the bottom back of the boat. Never let it get to the deck, kept ahead of the rain.If you have a very tall outlet to push water to such as three or four feet, this may not have the power to do it at a good capacity, but if you're only pushing water a foot or two feet up and out as in most regular fishing or bass boats, it will do just fine."

256182,1,"Since when I was 14 years old, I have a back problem due to a trauma caused by excess of weight that I had to carry. Since then, I suffer from terrible back pains. I did a MRI that showed my intervertebral discs damaged and going out from where it was supposed to be (prolapsed disc). So, going to a chiropractic would relieve my pain due to the strech. I figure why not buy an inverter... So I did and I can tell it will relieve your aches. In the beginning you may feel nauseous but you get used to the new position and will be satisfied with no more pains. If you make an inversion at least once each two days, probably you will live a normal life and won't be limited due to the stress the pain causes you. Recommended!PS: The boots are comfortable. Of course, you are upside down and at a point you will feel some discomfort in your anckle, but I can't imagine something holding you upsidedown more comfortably than this.UPDATE 11/20/2012:Never had a back ache again!!! The product is still in shape, still in place at my door and I use it less than before, simply because my back aches are gone! I mean, right in the beginning I used it once a week, then I started to use once a month and now... It's like once each 3-4 months. And that is because I am feeling ""young"" again and doing stuff I was not supposed to do, like lift weight and stuff.This is totally worth and for the benefits it brings your health, you can't go wrong.I am very glad I bought it and if you have back aches like mine (when in crisis, I wouldn't be able to leave bed!), you look no further."
197114,0,"The product was shipped quickly and arrived to my door very fast. I was disgusted to see the box was ripped and part of the exposed scooter was sticking out of the box. It was all scratched up. It was packaged so poorly. There was no protection around it in the box. It was a gift. I decided to give it with the scratches on it instead of returning it to Amazon.com because the return policy was very vague and I could not tell if I could return it without paying for the return shipping. I guess next time, I will buy at a store."

373583,0,"For the price the socks are a good value. It is the strange method of delivery that was my major complaint. Since diabetic socks are more loosely knitted to help circulation, it was illogical to me to find metal clips binding the socks at the toe and top in the packaging. If the socks are pulled apart as is the natural inclination, the metal clips rips the toe and unravels the threading at the top of the sock opening even before you put them on. Otherwise, taking that precaution, they are a good price."
70816,0,"Purchased this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. Assembly was somewhat straight forward. However, if you're not familiar with bike repairs or assembly it could be more than a bit challenging.The scooter was packed fine, had all the parts with it but the rims were a mess. All spokes were loose & neither rim was true. In fact they wobbled badly. Trying to straighten them out took some time after first tightening all the spokes. One spoke nipple was frozen & ended up getting stripped. Oh well, that speaks to the quality.Brakes are okay but are hard to adjust as others have written. Both axles were overtightened at the factory so they didn't spin freely at all. Those had to be adjusted as well before installation.Overall, the Kent Super Scooter seems like it will be safe & fun for her to play with. Paint was slightly scratched here & there but still looked decent so I decided not to send it back. Glad it was on sale. I could not see paying full price for this scooter of average quality."

347319,0,"After having reviewed the dozens of racks available on Amazon, I decided to go with this one. It did not fit my truck as well as I felt it should have, especially after being told by the site that it would. There are a few things about the rack that are not clearly explained in the instructions. Knowing what I know now, I'm not entirely certain I'd go this way again.You may find it helpful to know that the rack will not stabilize one or two or three or four bikes in the bed of the truck by itself. You will need to provide additional stabilization for the bike or bikes toward the back of each bike. Bungee cords help, but of course, they did not come with the rack.Considering the fact that I did not have to drill holes in the truck bed to mount this and that it is removable, I'll continue to use this rack, but it's not the easiest thing in the world to deal with and my thinking is still, there must be a better way."

329332,2,"Okay, so I got this gun last year, it broke after about a months use. People say its accurate and yes it is, but not any more accurate than a regular AK47. I took it apart and the inner barrel(the one that actually matters) was shorter than the one I had in my other AK. The barrel was also made of a cheap material, and as I was taking it apart I noticed there were huge weights in the hand grips, not cool. Its basically a normal AK put into a SVD shell, I would not recommend buying this gun. If you want a good ak look up the DBoys AK74. That was the best AEG I bought next to the JG Vietnam M16.

5305,0,"These shorts run ridiculously small. I triple checked the size on the tags and on the interior because I was so sure I was sent the wrong pair. Since these are so much smaller than I expected, I would definitely recommend trying these on in a store to determine size. Plus, I didn't know until too late that the seller gouges the price for shipping, in both directions, which is going to make returning them a really expensive hassle. So, be sure to review all the necessary details of the shipping policy and rates before purchasing."

If you buy this product, be sure to permanently secure the float to the float arm."

The material is thinner than most wetsuit material, and the zipper is a small, standard clothing zipper, but the shorts work fine for this use. As another reviewer pointed out, they are not form-cut, but I am after practicality and comfort and not fashion: again, they work for my purpose and are cheap. I hand wash them after every use to get the salt out. Afte six uses they are holding up. I find the medium size accurate and not the smaller ""European sizings"" you sometimes run into. Here are the waist sizes printed on the box:SM = 24"" - 29""MD = 30"" - 35""LG = 36"" - 41""XL = 42"" - 46"""

242663,1,"Someone gave me one of the older Tippmann Model 98 guns ( not the custom or custom pro model ). I wanted a stock to make the gun less awkward when shooting and decided to order this stock. The only adjustment I had to make was filing a SMALL strip of plastic where the stock is secured inside the gun (in between the two ""rings"" that keep it from sliding out). I just used a small bastard file and it took less than two minutes. I love the fact that it's collapsible, which makes it very easy to change from when I shoot it fully extended and when my 7 year old son shoots it (fully collapsed). This stock is a VERY welcomed functional addition to my gun, but it also enhances the visual aesthetic. I shot a good 100 paintballs or so and everything seems to be working great. As a police officer who is used to actually aiming at things when I shoot, I find this stock makes it very easy to aim the gun properly, which enhances the guns accuracy (which still isn't perfect because hey, it's a paintball gun). I would highly recommend this stock to anyone considering it."

Already the piece that attatched the canopy frame to the bottom frame broke away, and the fabric was wearing/ripping under the feet area before this.I called the 1-800 number, and spoke to a woman who informed me the trailer I purchased was manufactured in 2007, and has been discontinued. I had to push a bit to get them to send new fabric, and it seemed like she didn't believe that this item was just purchased a few months ago.I was able to request the replacement parts, but warned that next time I need to have proof of order on hand (I did when calling this time, but was not asked for the order number from Amazon.com)."

I am 5'10"" 230# - I got the XL and they are about 1"" above the knee. My only nit is that the compression on the legs could be a little tighter but that is probably the fact that I went a size up. Bought a second pair with longer legs and I like them just as much."

It stores and unfolds nicely, but installing the cross supports on the ends requires herculean strength. You have to pull the fabric tight and slide the supports down over a retaining knob, but it's very, very difficult to stretch the fabric enough to do this. I can do it, but my wife (she's strong, by the way) has great difficulty. it's impossible for my 12 year old son. Overall it's a good cot, but be aware of these set-up issues.

309797,2,"I don't usually give bad reviews, but I don't have much good to say about this tent. We bought this tent for our recent camping trip to Connemara, Ireland. We needed a large tent because we had to be able to fit our 11-week-old's playpen in it. We never got to sleep in it because the high winds (steady at 40 mph with gusts of up to 60 mph) in that area destroyed the tent within 5 hours. We did everything the manual said for high winds, but I guess it just isn't made for that kind of weather. The strange thing is all the other tents (cheap plastic or fiberglass poled tents) survived fine. It was probably due to the high, not-rounded, profile of the tent. One pole snapped in half, and all the others are permanently bent. Also one of the rings broke off. We're sending it back to get fixed, but the next time we go camping, we'll choose a campground that is more sheltered from the winds. I am disappointed though that this heavy duty tent broke when the cheap fiberglass and plastic tents survived."

212883,1,"I purchased this reel with some concern that I was getting a ""cheap"" reel instead of an inexpensive one. I traditionally have paid as much as 5 times this amount for my steelhead and salmon reels. I intended to use it for Steelhead fishing in the midwest, as a streamer setup, and figured that even if it wasn't that great, I would have a fall back for my other reels. Once I received it, I was very impressed with the quality of the drag system and the smooth retrieve. I changed my mind, once I saw it and have used it as a dry line, indicator rig, because I trust the action and the drag. Definitely an incredible value for the money, and warranteed for a year so if there are any problems, Okuma will stand behind the product. I am blown away by this item and may end up getting more of them based on the quality I have seen."

227540,1,"These are GREAT, I mean really GREAT overalls! I mistakenly ordered a too-large set to start with- I took the advice of (apparently male) other reviewers, and ordered larger than my waist and inseam measurements. They didn't fit. I swam about in them for a minute or two, but was immediately impressed with the quality of the fabric, stitching, and overall (pardon the pun) design. I'm usually a 32-34/34 in jeans, but in these, a 36/34 was waaaay too large. On a whim, my husband asked to try them on, and they were long, even on him- and he's 6'1 / 210 lbs.- but he immediately fell in love with them. (And they actually look pretty hot on him- can't say that about most overalls on most men.) This was actually fortunate, as it gave me a better idea of what size to order for myself (and saved me from the Valentine's Day conundrum, LOL!) So now I have my own pair as well, and I gotta say, they're just wonderful- the color is darker than pictured, but I like that. The details are nicely done, the pockets are a delight (and I keep finding MORE of 'em all the time), they're well-put-together, comfortable, and well....they're just GREAT. The legs are a little long, but I don't care- better too long than too short. I wound up getting a pair in 34/32, and that's working out nicely for me- room enough to layer shirts if needs be, but definitely cute with a smaller, non-bulky top.A special note to other female buyers: the other terrific thing about these is that the bib is wide enough to accomodate a woman's chest, without that weird, uh, centering/not centering thing that happens with overalls that AREN'T wide enough up top- no &#34;peek-a-boob&#34; effect, which is my major gripe with the makers of many &#34;ladies'&#34; overalls. (I mean, why on earth would you skimp on the bib fabric, for a clientele with breasts? I mean, REALLY?!) And if your fella has the classic suit-wearing physique, broad-shouldered and narrow-hipped, he will look GREAT in a set of these, no joke! (Got a &#34;Jethro&#34; fantasy, ala Beverly Hillbillies? I didn't, either. Until I got my husband a pair of these. *Giggle*)These are comfortable, well-made, high-quality overalls, and the price is right- much nicer than other brands that I could mention, and have wasted money on in the past. If you're going to drop some cash for a good pair of overalls, these would be your best bet. You will not be disappointed!"
240087,2,I purchased a large number of these to give as gifts for my employees. Several of them had trouble locking the blade in place when opened so the blade could close on to your hand while in use. Also the belt clip broke off several of them when first used.

448558,0,"This is a bike that will get you where you want, but not with pizzaz. The Pacific Singe is a bit smallish for larger riders and a major shortcoming is the close location of the front tire to the pedals. When traveling at low speeds (requiring a larger front handlebar movement), the front tire will collide with the rider's feet. This needs to be re-engineered as it could cause a crash.The suspension is surprisingly effective for such an inexpensive bike. I was also impressed with the handling and brakes at higher speeds.It's a solid bike for smaller riders."

Also, I didnt break a sweat for at least 45 minutes and after my workout on the gazzelle, I did not feel sore and certainly did not feel like I had a good workout. This machine is nothing like they advertise on tv and I regret I ever bought it..."
227072,0,"I ordered two of these at $33. each, so I guess I really lucked out on the price. The bleat call is probably the most realistic. While the packaging says it is supposed to be a doe announcing that she is ready for the rutting buck, it sounds more like a fawn. The rattling feature is a close second, but it lasts for quite a long time. The snort/wheeze? I am not so sure that it is loud enough and the grunt is too loud. The grunt sounds more like a tree frog trying to imitate a bull frog. I will keep one for myself for no other reason that I feel like all deer respond to a fawn, even if the buck is merely following a concerned doe. I will send the other one to my nephew."

101282,1,Macho Warrior kicks are the best foot pads I have found for sparring. The extra layer of padding protects the instep and also reduces the impact on your partner. The pads are subject to tearing under hard sparring conditions but this should be expected. Red duct tape is the best repair tool I have found and the pads remain usable.

154824,0,"Contrary to the product description, the one I've received is 19 oz, and there isn't any easy way to replace the weight bolt. It seems that all MFH2X60 series come in two flavors - 19 or 20 oz. If you really need to specify the weight, you'd better look elsewhere. On the other hand, this is a pretty good beginner cue stick. When the two pieces are put together, the center of mass is about 4.5'' from the top edge of the grip. I'd have given it 4 stars if those ""Made in China"" labels weren't so hard to remove (in fact, I had to use isopropanol to clean off the adhesive residue along the shaft)."

We like to warm the cups on the grill, while heating the water for hot beverages. We also use the mugs for water while brushing teeth and I use them for rinsing the dishes. The quality is top-notch.

381507,0,"When things work, this pedometer is excellent with great computer software to record your data over a period of months and years.But, in my opinion, there are two flaws in the design, one in the unit and one in the software. Sooner or later you may get the frustrating download error when trying to download data to your computer. I will offer a partial solution below under Flaw 1. If you research the Internet and read user reviews, the time for such a malfunction to appear can be from days, weeks, or months after purchase. My pedometer had its first download problem after 2 years - so I guess I am lucky.Flaw 1: the pedometer can get a corrupt day, which prevents you from downloading data to your computer. Not sure what causes the corrupt day but many have experienced it, as you can see by reading reviews and cruising the Internet. A computer software engineer figured out that if you set the time to 11:59 pm and then wait a minute for the start of the next day, you replace one of the 42 saved days. If you keep doing this, which is very time consuming - and you lose data of course, you should eventually get rid of the corrupt day. Why didn't Omron include in their reset button a way to clear the data on past days? I consider this a hardware design flaw since the user has to spend an hour or more to completely reset the unit.Flaw 2. There is a password lock on the database file omron.mdb. So you cannot readily edit the data to at least enter in some estimates for the days you lost due to the Omron corrupted-day malfunction. However, another computer expert on the Internet discovered that the password appears to be Fk4+0fK[L9j which got me into the database. However, you really have to be expert with this since there are many fields (two for each hour of the day - total steps and aerobic) and you can easily mess things up. Why can't Omron give us the software feature to edit our data easily and therefore at least enter estimates for the data lost due to the corrupted-day malfunction due to Omron? I consider this a software design flaw.If you are using the Pedometer without the software, then i can say that it has never failed me as then you do not download data. It was the downloading of the data which eventually haunted me.I have two Omron pedometers since I had bought one for my mom and I am thinking of using two in case the corrupt day surfaces again.At the very least, I intend to download my data daily since if you wait days (you can wait up to 42 days), if you get a corrupt day, you will lose much data.I hope this experience helps customers in their shopping decisions.MichaelAsheville, NC"

229591,1,"I have had these shoes for almost two years in a martial art that involves rolling, punching, kicking, ground fighting and plenty of high intensity fighting. For how cheap these shoes are (and how cheap they look), they have stood up extremely well.Finally after two years, the rubber on the bottom has worn through to my sock under both big toes, but I have had regular walking shoes wear out faster. My only complaint is that the metal eye holes for the laces popped out less than a month after I bought them. Even so, there was no functional consequence. The laces didn't wear through the material.As for comfort, they offer little ankle support, nor are they supposed to. They do allow for almost complete freedom of movement. I would suggest these shoes to those who want protection for their feet, but the freedom and feel of wearing no shoes."

The Radians are a lot more comfortable, and I think I could wear them for a much longer time, but the cheap Milwaukee muffs seam to provide a better seal and more noise reduction. The Radians supposedly have a higher rating (Milwaukee: 28 NRR, Radians: 29 NRR), but on my head, the Milwaukee muffs just feel tighter and a bit more solid against my skin.I'm glad I bought two pair, I have one that's comfy and one that seals well.

61684,1,"I ordered this bottle after becoming tired of using another water bottle without a straw. You had to tip it up to drink the water and it was nearly impossible with the wide mouth not to spill some water. The cap on that bottle also would hold excess water and would leak slightly when shaken or moved slightly.This bottle has proven to be much more user friendly. It takes a lot less time to flip up the valve and take a sip than open mouth bottles. The valve cap takes a bit of time to get used to, but I ended up liking it after a while. The valve also helps to stop leakage. When shaken or left tilted the bottle has not leaked any water.The bottle itself has been pretty durable to drops and to normal wear and tear, but the tap on top of the valve that you push on to bring up the cap so you can drink from the straw has broken after only a month or so. It's still pretty easy to get to the straw to drink but it would have been nice if the tab had lasted a little longer, although one or two drops may have also contributed to its downfall.Overall, the bottle is great for taking quick sips of water on the go and is fairly easy to clean and use."
33973,0,These gloves are fairly warm but I find that glove liners are best when riding in the low 30's. They could also use more padding.Besides that I would still call these a good buy.
59983,0,"I bought this on clearance expecting it to fit as my daughter wears size 28 in all other swimsuit brands. Not the case - she couldn't even squeeze into it. Its a nice thick suit would be a good training suit, just sizing issue."
330867,1,"I purchased these same shirts a year ago in a store size XXL which fit perfectly. I ordered the same shirts from another website a little later and they ran way too long in the sleeves and hem. I purposely ordered a smaller XL this time from Amazon and they are still too big! I don't know if Russell makes them differently now or what. I am a big guy so this shocks me. It probably wouldn't bother me but I like to wear them under an open button down shirt for the layered effect. Besides the size issue, I love these comfortable, easy care tees."
243202,0,"I like the tee as it is sturdy. But, I don't like the small imprinted emblem on the sleeve near the cuff as it clashes with some things I want to wear the tee with."

Well, I accidentally tested the product by swallowing it...mistook a Boric Acid [BA] capsule [that I made to use as a Vaginal Suppository for yeast infection] for a vitamin pill. Absolutely no ill effects... granted I drank a lot of water in an effort to dilute the Boric A. after I ingested it. I was pleased the BA pill had no adverse effects that I could detect. I use it for smelly feet and vaginal yeast infection [powder goes into a capsule inserted into vagina]... I am currently trying it as a tear stain remover on my white poodle..mixed with a litte corn starch.... Don't have results on that yet!"

So I got him men's under armour to help keep him warm cause he is not use to winter here in West Virginia. It's been a big help it keeps him warm. Thank You."
204760,0,"This compact machine is easy to use and will give you a terrific workout. Even for people like me, who don't enjoy exercising, it's a simple and easy way to stay in great shape. I just set it up in front of the TV and work out to music videos on VH1 Classic (all the motivation of music with all the distraction of television). I love the display, as well, which cycles between minutes spent, calories burned, and stairs climbed - very rewarding to see those numbers climb with you. It's also not too hard to balance on, though if you're nervous about falling over, just pull up a dining room chair next to you, with the back of the chair facing you as a kind of hand rail.Unfortunately, for all its good qualities, the InStride Mini-Stepper is just not very well made. Like many other reviewers, I find the constant squeaking irritating. But even worse, only a few months into owning this thing, one of the shocks started leaking oil. Fortunately, it was still under warranty and the company sent me a replacement, but not long after that, the other shock started leaking, too. What a pain, and a mess! I guess you get what you pay for..."
5105,0,"Very easy to install, but in just over a month of constant use (it's now winter and I'm using the lights daily) the tab on the rubber ring which holds the rear light in place has torn away and the band on the front light is cracking around the locking lug.Great idea, poor materials."

259862,2,"I bought this for my mom on Mother's Day. I got this one in particular because it came with an Exercise Chart. My mom is 90 and needs guidance on how to use any new product. I live 3000 miles away, so it is not practical for me to demonstrate it myself.She received the Balance Block, but it came with no directions or Exercise Chart. When I asked about the Exercise Chart, I was told:""When we first started selling Airex products less than a year ago, the Coronella mats came with carry bags, and the Balance Blocks came with charts. Through recent orders like yours, we have discovered that this is no longer the case. Our contact at SPRI (our distributor of Airex products) cannot even find an exercise chart for your balance block in their inventory list anymore."""
21965,1,"This bag err, liner, rocks! I love how it sports the Columbia name all over it's black and blue colors :) It's lightweight and packs down well in its own compression sack about 16"" long and 6 1/2"" wide. No more big and bulky fill bags that take up half your storage bin! I've used it once for a mock camp and it slept well around 60 degrees. I am going to try it as a 3 season bag in conjunction with using my tent heater. Now that might not work for everyone, but its perfect for me as I dont like to be weighed down with heavy covers, so if you're like that too I know this will be a sweet looking bag for you."

I recommend them."
380442,2,The only pro thought concerning this pedometer is that it does accurately measure your steps.BUT:1. Clasp is terrible. I am currently looking for this device as it fell off of my belt. I have had this device come loose from my belt and fall at least 10 times and I haven't owned it a month yet.2. Software is limited. Just good for downloads. Limited info.3. Thank GOD it was only $32. Not even worth that much. Just bought a FitBit One to replace this device.
40078,1,"My wife, being the consumate singer that she is, took her latest Christmas present to our favorite bar. She easily plugged it in to their PA system and she was off and singing! The sound quality was great as she roamed around the bar singing everyone's favorite tunes. It definitely supports a pretty decent distance between the mic and the base station and like I said, the sound quality was great. Couldn't ask for anything more!"
25010,0,"I purchased this jump rope several weeks ago and just started using it, since it took me this long to adjust the rope. The metal crimp inside the handle took me 45 minutes to open and allow rope adjustment. You cannot just tie a knot in the rope and call it a day. The rope will not spin properly. Once I finally made the necessary changes, the rope seem to perform fine. What do you expect for a cheap price? Good for what you paid for it."
51811,0,"This game is trying to give you the experience of being a college football player/student athlete. Some may find doing classwork and booster events entertaining, but I just want to concentrate on playing the game. Why didn't EA just focus their energy on improving the game on the field? ESPN is heavily involved in this game, doing all the stats and commentary. Commentary is pretty standard, and for the most part matches the action on the field. As usual, after a couple of games you hear the same ole same ole comments. Graphics are nice in hd, but not the level of fight night to me. Fight Night and Oblivion are the only 360 games that have floored me thus far. I'm starting to wonder why I shelled out $400 for a 360! The stadiums are very sweet and in hd you can see the blades of grass on the field. I rented this same game for the xbox to compare it. The 360 version does look better, but the regular xbox version isn't far behind. This game is good, but not great. We need more competion in the gaming industry, so above average games aren't the only avenue we have as consumers to sports games. 3 outta 5 stars from Nashville!"
462694,1,The knife and very sharp. I have used it plenty of times the bade isn't loose yet at all. It just barley fits my hand so if you have XL hands then might be a little small
86755,0,"Had high hopes for this SOG but was disappointed with how ""plastic"" it felt. It felt overly hollow, and the assist feature left if ""twanging"" with resonance when opened. The blade felt thin, I was afraid I'd break it during use. I returned it and picked up a Spyderco Tenacious instead, a knife I liked much better. If you don't mind the hollow plastic feel, this would likely be a fine knife though, had no other real issues with it."

354652,0,"I ordered these to wear during workouts (WiiFit, Tae-Bo, and Yoga). I ordered a 38EU, which should have been a bit small, if anything, according to the sizing chart. Not so. They are actually about a size (or 1 1/2 size) too big. It's a shame, because they seem to be nice, otherwise, and would be great for working out. Lightweight, and seem to be well made. I'm going to give them to my sister, who should be able to fit them."
289296,1,"It's a pretty good deal for the price. First thing I did when I got it is turn up the speaker of my notebook computer to max volume and play some loud music, then I put the protector on. I can still hear the music, but not so much the drums and bass. I think if I wear ear plugs it'll work even better. This is great for those of you that live in apartments, we all know there are noisy neighbors no matter where you go, and especially if you stay in low-end apartments there are even more of them. So this might help taking some of the stress out of living in an economically practical housing."

279268,0,"I purchased this Air Mattress to go camping with and it worked perfectly quick inflating and deflating I couldn't complain about anything at all. Then I stayed at a friends house while my house was being remodeled. Sleeping on this Air Mattress everyday for a month I actually preferred it to my TempurPedic bed. The Air Mattress can easily be adjusted firmer and softer with a twist of a knob and a push of a button... Now the bad part, one of the final days I needed it I noticed there was a random high hard tube in it (a chamber must have broke and created a super chamber) its still useable just not the amazing five star purchase it was... In Conclusion its a great value for occasional use it feels better than any mattress I've ever slept on, but it is an Air Mattress you shouldn't be sleeping on it everynight, if you have to you've probably made some poor choices in life."

392332,1,"I've tried dozens of grips. I've raced and toured in all kids of weather from ice & snow to torrid summer humidity & rain, to dry deserts, and these are simply the best grips for every condition I've ever used. This includes the new ESI grips, which are a strong 2nd place, but much more money, and more fragile. And, don't believe those who say you can reuse these. Use a spoke to lift 'em off the bar a bit, pour a bit of water into the gap, work it around, and soon you'll be able to get 'em off with some good tugging. I've moved pairs of these grips from bike to bike for YEARS, and never had 'em come loose during use. Great great USA-made grips!"
137278,0,"I have always purchased Russell teeshirts for my husband. However, these have drastically changed over the years. They were quite heavy and wore very well. The ones I recently purchased are no where near the quality of Russell T's I have purchased in the past. I can only assume they will not where as well. I gave them 3 stars because they are better then most of the colored teeshirts out there."
84437,0,"It is an OK watch. It does not appear to have a way of setting the seconds. I liked the Mio watch that I had before this one better. (It should be noted that it only lasted about 4 years--the strap less and there was no replacement for it from Mio. I find that it is often slow to respond to reading my pulse rate. This included the gym where the amount of skin moisture should be enough to give a reading. I will think twice about ordering a Mio replacement, should it fail as did the last one."
390136,1,"The instructor is obviously an experienced yogi, i.e. someone who has studied and taught yoga for a long time. I find this generally preferable to an aerobics instructor who has recently jumped onto the yoga bandwagon. This tape is great for the novice, and a wonderful intro to yoga."
104938,0,I purchased this to mount a scope to my Marlin Model 60SB. The rifle has a stainless steel barrel and these rings are more of a bright silver in color. They look pretty darn good on the rifle but anything more than a cursory look easily shows that the rings are not made of stainless steel. Unlike another reviewer the finish on the set I received was fine with no marks or blemishes. The finish of the metal isn't too smooth but for the amount I paid I can't complain much. They get the job done so what more can I ask for?
41459,0,Because I am someone that is bigger I was of the opinion that that 3xl would fit that way that I like ........ although the fit is ok I just thought that it would have a little more room in the shorts being a 3x...... otherwise good shorts
7963,2,"Even my 5' girlfriend didn't fit in this narrow hammock, much less me at 6'. More trouble than it's worth to return it -- I used the ropes as extenders for another hammock. Don't buy this, you will be disappointed. Might be okay for a toddler."
69714,2,"Thought it would give my fingers and hands more grip, but it didn't do that.I think this product is for hands and fingers that are sweating, as in when the moisture makes some things hard to hold on to.For dry hands that are slippy, another product will likely be better but I haven't yet found it."

199245,0,"It lets me know how fast I'm going and how far I've gone - that is more than I had (which was nothing) before. Having said that, a reviewer that I read before buying the product made it sound as if everyone else was a little stupid for complaining about resetting the trip mileage - which is a pain when riding by the way - and that things like avg. mph would be reset by resetting the trip mileage to 0 (which has to be done a digit at a time). THIS IS NOT THE CASE and that guys review should not be a featured review as it is incorrect. The whole machine has to be reset to get a fresh avg mph - which means you have to input the wheel size, your weight etc. before each ride that you want an avg mph for...and you lose all of your previous data. Said all of that to say, it lets me know how fast I'm going at any given moment and how far I've gone...it's just not real convenient...did I mention that it's better than what I had before?"
504815,0,"Let me preface this review by saying this is my very first serious backpack, so I may sound ignorant to a more experienced buyer. Lafuma is high-quality, no doubt. For me, however, this bag is not all that I needed. The first problem is I could not find any fitting information on this bag on Amazon, Lafuma's website, or any other sites. I am 6'1"" and it is too small. It seems like it would fit someone 5'9"" and under, but I'm just guessing, I could be way off. It's a top-loading bag and I didn't think that would bother me, but it does (it may not bother you). The zipper pocket at the front of the bag is genius, but b/c the bag does not fit me it is in an inconvenient place for me, but probably is in a good spot if the bag fits you. Same with the water bottle pouches (which are humongous and can fit any sized bottle, seemingly) and the zipper on the back of the bag; they're great but inconvenient for me since it's too small. A 28 bag is small, like a middle-schooler's backpack, but I imagine it would seem larger if it weren't top-loading.I just discovered that there is a ""shower cap"" for the bag tucked in underneath the outside flap that covers the bag and protects it from rain, which is brilliant! Another thing I didn't know before buying is that there is a zipper pouch on the very top of the bag, underneath the elastic straps.Basically, the one thing I didn't like was that it's top-loading, and everything else stems from the fact that it doesn't fit me. If it fit me I'd probably give a 4.5, and if it were not a top-loader I'd probably give it a 5."
354623,0,"OK, the shoes are fine and expecially for the money. the first pair I ordered, were so huge for my son who actually does martial arts that I had to find someone else who could wear them. My son liked them tho, so I ordered another pair a full size smaller and they were still big but wearable. I think if they actually fit,they would be a great shoe"
504773,1,"This is a great tent. It has excellent ventilation, and I am a big fan of being able to look at the stars through the mesh ceiling, and clear part of the rain fly. I also love the little zipper areas on the floor by the door that allow you to quickly throw things in and take things out of the tent, like sneakers, and purses. It has great storage extras, and is completely safe from the rain. Easy set up after the first time. The directions aren't very complete."
70381,1,"I, like most other boaters have struggled to find a solution to the problem of flying a flag off my boat. Most of the other products don't do the job, allowing the flag to ride up or come off at low speeds. Others require cutting the product apart and ruining it, if you ever want to change the flag. I was lost in a sea of useless boating accessories until I found Charveloix Clips. They are simply the BEST!!! They are extremely easy to put on and allow the user to remove them at anytime over and over agian. They're extremely durable and last for years, while being outside and unprotected. This product is bar-none the best buy for your flag flying needs...I would strongly recomend buying a pair or two....It truly is worth it!!!!!!"
263197,0,"The elastic inside the bar snapped the first time the bar was extended - with VERY little force applied. I disassembled the bar and removed the elastic to find it was very badly frayed where it broke. Obviously it was like this when it left the vendor. I repaired it using a small bungee cord and everything seems to be OK. I have not requested a refund or replacement as it now works fine. However, the vendor should look into possible QC issues. I'm posting this here because there is no option in past orders to contact seller once an item has been delivered EXCEPT to arrange for a replacement or refund.The bar itself seems strong and well made. I'm sure it will do the job."
472464,1,"In the past, I owned the 8926a with the miyota movement and oyster bezel, and since gifted to my family. I missed the Invicta 8926 so much as a casual/dress watch, that I went ahead and ordered the OB version with the coin-edge bezel. I love the pro diver series, and this version came with a Seiko NH35A automatic movement. It works really well, and keeps very good time in comparison with a Swiss movement I have, which is the CL888. I recommend this timepiece for someone looking for a great watch without breaking the bank."
259720,0,I regularly use big game in different poundage on most all my rods. Great inexpensive product. Only complaint was I was misled on the size of the spool and thought I was purchasing a large spool not a small spool. It was actually cheaper at Walmart

375290,1,I bought two dozen of these for practice with the kids. They love them because they are a little forgiving if one gets away. I love them because they are durable.
245208,0,"The long sleeve shirt shrunk a bit after washing and drying and is stiff and clings to you a bit unlike other similar shirts I have. It does wrinkle a bit and is just ""OK"" for the price.

13657,0,"Look, the socks are great, but even though the money isn't an issue for me, it just ****ing pains me to spend 12+$'s on a single pair of socks. I'm a life long athlete, and I learned before I was 20 that if you want quality athletic gear, you're going to pay for it. HOWEVER, even underarmour (who I generally buy socks from) gives you two pair for this amount, and they're better quality... However, they don't have five toed renditions, and I am a five toe fanatic (I have the skeletoes V 2.0, Adipures, and a pair of the Vib-KSO's (great shoes company sucks)) so I have to buy these for athletic whatnots.Though, if you're like me and you wear five fingers everywhere, save yourself a few bucks and get some of the riverstone ones (http://www.amazon.com/Riverstone-Goods-Socks-Two-Pack-womens/dp/B003DRLMBI/ref=pd_sbs_a_2)for light work outs and everyday wear. I hope one of the major athletic companies out there gets with the program though, so I don't have to give anymore of my cash to these jokers.M"
220642,1,Fit perectly on my AR (Bushmaster M4A3). Feels great...much better than original. No issues as others have had. Very snug fit. Took about 3 mins to install. A great upgrade for the price. Thought about putting one on a long time ago...wish I had...glad I finally did. I plan on putting these on all my AR's. Very pleased with this product...you will be too!!
43722,2,"I purchased this lock when I purchased a Thule bicycle rack thinking that this would integrate with the rack. I was wrong. This lock is way over priced at $40 or so and a similar lock with a thicker cable for probably 1/3 of the price or less can be had from Onguard or Kryptonite.This is a typical key cable lock that gives minimal security. I purchased it to at least lock the bikes to our rack so they could not easily be lifted, all of course when we travel with our bikes and keep them in view. This lock is not meant for security as a cable cutter will easily cut through."
187232,2,"I am not quit 5 foot five. These pants are too short for me if I pull them to the waste. Surprising they are so short. Also found one defect in the sewing near the product. I put them on and wore them because I needed them so can't consider returning them. The rest of the pants are true to fit, like the three strip shorts, just not long enough."
157268,2,This seat looks very comfortable and very reasonably priced but neither my husband nor I cared for the ride. It felt like we were falling off the bike all of the time. We tried adjusting to no avail. Maybe this type seat just takes some getting used to.
107991,1,"These grip trainers are great. I use them at work to strengthen my grip. I'm not a big guy - scrawny would be accurate, but the green is easy enough to do 50x or so. The petite woman in the office can squeeze it a few times without much straining. The black ring is about right for me - and most of the guys in the office. The red ring is mainly for office macho contests during breaks - ""can you squeeze the red one 15 times and keep your underwear clean?"" So far everyone that has tried the rings have discovered the cool side effect - cracking knuckles - especially when using the red ring. They seem pretty durable, but it's hard to tell after a week of use. If they last a year in the office, they'll last an average person a lifetime - and this item will deserve 5-stars."
502886,0,My husband and I have been wearing Accusplit pedometers for about 8 years and have been pleased with the accuracy and durability of them up until about a year ago. Since then we have bought new pedometers (also Accusplit) to replace our old ones that finally konked out and they are not at all accurate in terms of counting steps. My husband's runs too low and mine runs too high. Plus they don't seem to be as sturdy as they were in the past. It seems Accusplit isn't as great as we once thought they were and are disappointed in the performance of our current pedometers.
345567,2,"I went ahead and got this after reading the reviews, knowing about the cardboard insert, knowing some leak, hoping I get a ""good"" one. After carefully removing the cardboard insert, I was preparing to do the ""sink test"", when I noticed one of the seams was split, creating a small hole for water to enter. After reading the reviews, it seems to me this happens a lot! This is very flimsy plastic with fragile seams. The seams easily split open. The plastic is so thin (like plastic wrap), I fear car keys will poke a hole in them (I bought this specifically to hold rental car keys while snorkeling on vacation). The mechanism at the opening which is designed to keep out water seems to work. No one complained about water getting in at the opening. So it seems to me that Kwik Tek would have a great product if they used stronger plastic which was seamed properly to go with their awesome watertight lock.Update: I purchased the Lewis N. Clark Waterproof Multi Purpose Pouch, and it is a far superior product! Heavier weight plastic, larger so it holds more, better seams, still floats, and best of all is rated waterproof to 9 ft. Get that one and save yourself the grief."
348081,0,"This purchase was the first major screw up that has happened to me while using Amazon.com.I ordered heat shrink tubing but I received an inflatable boat fender instead.I know it sounds crazy but it is true.The UPS man had to use a dolly to bring it to my door. All the time I am looking at this giant box I am saying, ""What in the world could this be?""It was so crazy and funny that there was no way that I was going to send it back.Since I do not have a boat or a friend with a boat I have no practical use for the item except as a conversation piece.So a week or two after my experience I see someone making the news where they received an assault rifle after ordering a computer monitor.Anyway... It was worth a laugh or twelve."

318502,0,"Don't know about all of the other reviewers, but I wear a size 31-32 pants. This Belt is HUGE. Perhaps I'm wearing it wrong, but if you wear it like a normal belt I had a good 2 feet of leftovers (of which I cut off). It's long enough that I could wear it over my sholder (and for a while I did). The adjustability is nice. I can fit katanas, gunblades, sabers, flais. you name it, & it has game for it. Styling on the belt is good looking. A fair buy."
280686,2,"This is not normal stick tape. The color is great and it's fine for the grips, but useless for the blade. I'm not even sure how it can be called stick tape. Would love it if it was the normal thickness."
180516,1,"I've recommended this item to all my friends. It's very comfortable, and looks good on. The quality of the fabric, fit and style is outstanding. Inside pockets are plus, outside pockets zip to keep your stuff safe. Perfect for a cool summer night, or a chilly fall day. I'm always looking for something warm to put on, that doesn't feel bulky and dowdy, or weigh you down. This jacket fits the bill. Not to mention I got a great price, speedy service, and I love the color. I want more!"
348483,0,"Bought this for my nine-year old to go sailing occasionally. She's on the tall and slender side and this jacket is just a little bit short on her. It fits fine circumferentially and isn't loose there, which is why I'm keeping it. I'm not concerned it will come off at all, it just looks a little bit short."
510803,2,"I bought this same product 2-3 years ago for outdoor use. Did the job of keeping out the water. Can't last forever so got a new one. This one is made out of a different, lighter material. It cannot hold the rain. Rain puddles on top and when too heavy pulls the whole thing down and off. My table got soaked and ruined. Called manufacturer and they admitted they changed the material."
360269,1,I found this air bed to be all that was advertised. A very good pump - pumping up the bed in record time. The best Part? I no longer wake up with a back-ache.
95513,1,Purchased as part of the earthquake emergency pack I was assembling. Great whistle. Produced loud sound without much effort. Hook at the end was perfect for clipping on to the backpack that held all the emergency supplies.
432911,1,"I was looking for a good Jeep lighter -- let me explain. I own a 2000 Jeep Wrangler, and the best times are with the top down and the doors off. As such there is quite a bit of wind; even at slow speeds it makes using a traditional lighter an impossible task. I could use the electric cigarette lighter but that involves disconnecting the 3 or 4 electronic devices I've got daisy-chained out of that jack - not appealing and a pain while driving. This lighter changes that -- I've used it at 75MPH on the highway with no issues at all. I particularly like the water-resistant (proof? haven't tested that) nature, the ""take a beating"" construction and quality electronic ignition - not a problem after quite a bit of abuse. This lighter also seems to be more frugal with fuel than other lighters I've used -- it takes quite a while to burn through an entire tank. All in all, a great device - I highly recommend it."
327670,0,"I liked the color on these -- I chose the safety green. However, I am a person who sports a large, and when I ordered a large sweatshirt and got a very small ""medium-at-most"" I was a bit upset. Still like this sweatshirt though."
309621,1,"Right - so I've had this tent for over 10 years and have used it all over the world in hot and cold conditions. I have the original K2 not the XT so its a lovely purple and green version...After lots of use I feel I can give a balanced review:Pro:- Solid and bombproof. I've had it snow, high wind and in absolutely torrential rain with it sitting in 2cm of water without significant leaks. There is one spot on each side where I needed to do my own sealing but its been good in that regard unlike many other tents i have used.- Ventilation is excellent and not much condensation- Roomy for a tent like this- Not noisyCon- It is a bit heavy by today's standards - remember it is a generously sized 3 man tent- The down side of great ventilation is that it's not that warm so i can imagine if it were -22 outside then it might be well below zero inside. Most tents would be however.If i was looking for a new tent it would simply be to get something lighter and smaller along the lines of a hilleberg but for value the eureka tents are quite good and despite what other reviewers might say much better than a coleman - who also make some good family tents"
368680,2,i have purchased shorts like these for a long time and these are by far the worst in quality...they are too thin and shrink too much. it is kind of a bumber because they are the only ones i can find in white. hopefully they will change the fabric content so the quality will be better...

There is a seal around the faceplate cover, but the rest of the thing is full of holes, the top and bottom halves have no seal between them, and the wiring/antenna exits in the rear are wide open. Bummer, 'cause I was excited about the little space on the right to hold an mp3 player, but that could have gotten soaked as well ..."
31008,1,"If there were 10 stars for the rating system instead of 5, I would probably give it 9 out of 10. It's a great product but it's not exactly what I was expecting. Yes, it's big enough for 2 adults and a picnic basket (not really much more). Yes, the handle is nice so it folds into a purse-like contraption for carrying. And yes, the backing seems to keep out the moisture since we last tested it on a moist lawn. But the top material is sort of plasticy. It's not crinkly cheap plastic, but it's not comfortable like a soft blanket. I guess there are give-and-takes when it comes to trying to stay dry or using a traditional blanket.I got several other picnic items at the same time on Amazon so check out those reviews as well. And let me know if you find them helpful!"

418587,1,"I love these shirts. I have several, split between three x and four x large. The three x fits me in the chest and arms perfectly, but the four has just the right length. I would say the sizing's off, but I suspect that is more about my body shape than the shirts themselves. The fabric is very comfortable for a synthetic, it is not too heavy nor too light, and it keeps you cool -- a must in summer weather. The colors are bright and bold and don't fade through the washes. I have other moisture-wicking shirts, but these are my favorites.The unfortunate thing is that it appears that Under Armour is dropping these, and not carrying the four x at all in any size polo. I don't know if that is a new company policy, they seem to pushing this new fabric instead of the HeatGear. I hope that there is a market large enough for them to keep producing these shirts. Word of mouth works; my coworker wore his new UA Performance polo to work today from my recommendation. If they are dropping this as a product, I will offer to take any remain stock off their hands."
488015,0,I ordered these a gift for my son-in-law and when I got them I wasn't really happy at how they looked. They looked kind of cheap and the Iowa Hawkeyes labels on the handles don't look like they will stay on very well. Time will tell. Wish they would have been a nicer looking set.

164075,0,"We bought this tent to use at the beach, since we live near the Gulf of Mexico. Even the slightest bit of wind is a problem with this tent. You can't erect or use this tent in any kind of wind at all, even minimal. I would not recommend this tent to anyone that plans on using it at the beach, since it is usually windy there."
43078,2,"Delivery was prompt. Gave as a gift to a friend, but was broken when he opened it. The counter balance weight inside was rattling around and the head of the buck didn't bobble. Called the phone number on the invoice and spoke to a woman who had a bit of an attitude. She informed me that it was late in the year and that they were out of stock and were doing inventory at the time. She said because of similar problems to what I encountered, they weren't sure if they were going to order any more. She did offer a refund if I shipped it back. My friend who I gave the gift to decided to keep it because it would at least look good in his new house, even though it wouldn't have the action. Over all, product not so great; service was so so."
71848,0,"This lantern doesn't give out as much light as other LED lanterns. The Coleman 3AA MicroPacker LED Lantern is a better choice because it has a much brighter LED that can fill a decent sized room with light. Since it's the same size as this one, it doesn't take up any more space for campers. This compact lantern is okay for the small confines of a tent, but it's not the best choice for an emergency home light."

The front reflector on my bike got in the way of the basket fitting closely to the frame of the bicycle. This fit makes it difficult to lift off and put back on quickly. I would purchase the larger basket next time, if you are putting it on an adult bike.But it is strong and looks cute."
460467,0,This ankle brace is good because I have full control over how much I want to tighten it. The bad part is that this brace kills my heel. It really digs into it. I have a bad ankle from having a car running over my foot and sometimes is very painful to walk on it. I put the brace on and the ankle pain is gone but soon the heel pain starts in.I tried the medium and large size because my foot is 11 1/2. The medium was to tight on the top of my foot towards my toes but fit better around my ankle. The large fit better around the top of my foot towards my toes but was more loose around my ankle like it was too big. I ended up buying the large because the medium was way to tight on top of my foot and I did not want it to cut off any circulation.I use my brace for normally walking and running for 1 hour.The brace is built very well.

405923,0,"With this style knife, you get what you pay for. It is a great looking knife, better than the picture suggests. It came with slight play in the blade. I can twist it, abliet only minutely, in the handle. It's not enough to affect the performance, but anything at all always bugs me when it comes to my knives. For the price, it is in my opinion worth it. It came sharp enough to shave my forearm out of the box, but I would have liked it a little sharper. It is much better than a lot of Bowie knives you'll get for twice the price, as a lot of cruddy ""display pieces"" are sold as quality use knives. Another thing, the plastic lining of the sheath tends to put scuff marks on the blade when retracted. They wipe off with minimal effort, but it's annoying. As I said, it's a good buy for about $20, but I wouldn't pay much more."
482490,1,"I've owned 2 of these for the last 2 and 5 years respectively and both still function flawlessly. I work in the south Texas concrete industry so these knives are exposed to dirt, sweat and sand on an almost daily basis and neither show any signs of wear other than a few small rust spots that are easily wiped off. They can also take and hold a razor edge, which I love for cutting masons line or lumber yard straps. All I can say is for the 80 dollars I got these 2 for they're easily going toe to toe with my $160 dollar Benchmade Nitrous Stryker and the speed safe mechanism functions faster and smoother than the Benchmade. The only improvement I would recommend is a grippier handle material."

253002,0,"I'm not sure it's worth $5 in shipping and handling!The Chinese Jump Rope games are different from what I learned growing up - although unlike the Klutz book they mention reciting the jumps as you do them - which is what I wanted. I was disappointed, though, to see that a few of them were VERY similar to each other. If two jumps are the same except that in one you start outside the ropes and in the other you start inside, it seems like cheating to count them as separate instead of just as two variations on the same one."
307599,1,"Unless you are hiking up Everest these tents will do everything you ask of them. Like most of the reviewers here, I grew up with these tents in Boy Scouts. I was in a very active troop in Washington State (a very wet, rainy and damp state, mind you!) and these tents saw two nights a week of use probably 48 weeks a year, except when they were used on week long 50 miler trips or hauled off for a week at scout camp. Over my four year scouting career I endured countless windstorms, thunderstorms, rain storms. Coupled with a proper groundcloth, you'll sleep dry every night. Properly (gently) taken care of, the tent should last you 10 years or more. Our tents in Boy Scouts typically got 200-400 nights of use before they were retired. The A-Frame is almost absurdly sturdy in high winds, and on the odd occasion something does break, replacement parts can be manufactured in the campsite using a pocketknife and a small branch. Standard size poles make it easy to replace parts, and a bent aluminum pole isn't detrimental to the structural integrity of your tent.We normally used these for backpacking 3-10 miles into the cascade mountains, although they'd gone on more than a few 7-12 day 50 milers through Canada and the pacific northwest before. Weighing 10 lbs, split between four people one person would get the tent (5 lbs) one person would get the rain fly, ground cloth, stakes and poles (5lbs), one person would carry the food (5lbs usually), and the fourth person would carry the stove + fuel & fuel canisters (5lbs). Scouts would balk at this, but on a fishing scale they almost always come out to exactly 5lbs each and it was considered fair.The tents are also very easy to put up. With some experience they'll go up in under 5 minutes. Our troop used to have blindfolded assembly races (imagine getting into camp late and your flashlight batteries are out) and all but the youngest (inexperienced) scouts had no trouble putting them together blindfolded. You won't be able to stand straight up in this tent, but bent over, you won't have to put your pants on laying down like in some ultra-lightweight geodesic hiker's tents/weatherproof cocoon. Typically these sleep only two people (very spacious, larger than a king size bed), but boyscouts will regularly fit 4, sometimes 5 smaller (age 9-12) kids in one tent."
318360,0,"While this would be a good frog for a broadsword, it can't be laced small enough for a rapier.

6709,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
477933,1,I injured the tendons in my ankle and could only walk if I put my weight on the outside of my foot which then tended to cause problems with my knee. This support did the job. I can know walk normally until my tendons heal. The only problem is size. There is no relation to shoe size in their sizes so I took a chance and ordered one knowing that Amazon would take it back. Luckily it fit. Ironically once you get the package it does list shoe size versus their sizes on the package.

99462,0,"I have seen several reviews that say this is a great bike for the price, but to me it was much more you get what you pay for. I used to ride allot when I was much younger but hadn't been riding for about 15 year when me and my wife decided to start again. I bought this bike at a local dept store because I didn't know if we would stick with it. Depending on what you want out of this bike it could be ok. If all you are looking for is a bike to look cool on for casual ride through the neighborhood then this bike is a good bang for your buck, but there are better choices out there. If you are looking to getting into road riding then this bike is going to let you down. The frame and wheels are heavy. The components are cheep which lead to the need for constant adjustments. The revo-shifters are terrible and totally inappropriate for road riding. The 700c X 28 tires are more appropriate to a cyclocross bike, and the brakes are down right scary.Over the course of the summer I have upgraded every component on the bike to Shimano Sora or Tiagra components (starting with the brakes) and have turned it into what an entry level road bike should have been.If all you need is a bike for casual riding and you don't want a mountain bike or one of the cruiser bike then this is really not too bad. If you want a entry level road bike then keep looking. One place to start is the AL-1 at Nashbar, aluminum frame with all Sora components for $400. Nashbar AL-1 Aluminum Road BikeBut to be honest you really should support your local bike shop. Unless you are mechanically inclined or willing to learn, the support of your LBS is well worth the added cost of a bike from them."

On numerous occasions I'd plug it in (making sure the power light was on), go back to work on the job site for 30-45 minutes, and come back expecting a hot lunch only to discover that the plug had lost its connection and my lunch was still cold. That was only after a couple months of occasional use. Very frustrating.However, other than that issue, which could probably be solved by replacing the plug (which you obviously shouldn't have to do to a newer product, but could), I think this stove is great. It's a very manageable size, but but still big enough to hold a big helping of food for one person. It also gets the food pretty hot in a reasonable amount of time. I'm glad I bought it."
435771,2,"This is the little brother of the DMT diafold. Very light and small. I keep one on my keychain. The extended length when open, is an aid to keeping a constant angle. I have never had one come apart but I suspect they are not as durable as the diafold and are not available two sided (two different grits) which of course, would be heavier. Mine seem to be rust resistant for use with water to wash away metal dust which would otherwise accumulate on the surface. These Mini Sharps are not for any work heavier than edge maintenance.UPDATE 9/7/2012:-- The molded-on flanges of the plastic handle broke off when I tried to unfold my Mini-Sharp. No more than normal force was applied. It is now in two pieces. I want an item like this to be dependable. Lowering my rating to one star."
18643,0,"I bought this tent as a temperary one sleeper. It is good for the price you pay for it. The bottom of the tent is made of the same mesh that the tent is made out of so it is not waterproof. You need soft enough ground for your pegs, otherwise the tent will not function properly. This would be great for one person and okey for two smaller people (one person would sleep the best.) This is not bad considering the price. I would also only use it if I knew there was going to be good weather and if it was not going to be too cold. Other than that, I would say this is an overall good purchase for the price."
456153,1,"This has the very basics necessary to get started. It has the oil, solvent, a bore snake, which is really inventive and cool, and wipe for the outside and other pieces of the gun.

Much faster than using patches and a bar.Would give it five stats if it came with a brush for cleaning internals when you disassemble the gun for a deep cleaning. Otherwise, this is a great starter kit."
135071,1,"The Parha Que Cottonwood is a wonderful design. The flexible poles are shock-corded and easily slip into place. Once the shade is stretched into place and staked to the ground, it is very secure and withstands gusty wind. It is so light weight that I have no problem carrying it when packed up. The amount of shelter is just large enough to protect from the sun or rain. My first six outings with it make me hopeful that this shelter will be durable for many years to come. It is a great addition to the camping gear.I have purchased a whole series of competitor products to essentially create a sun shade and rain shelter to use while camping. The others have either bent or broken in the wind. The last two were extremely heavy to lift into the back of the truck and I pinched my fingers more than once on set-up and pack-up.

It is lightweight, compact and fun!!!!In fact, my husband is going to order another one for our store. And the results are great!

443399,1,"After purchasing these pedals I attached them to my road bike. Since I will ride about 5,000 miles this year I wanted to try a new pedal. I put the cleats on a pair of my Lake road shoes. The first thing I noticed is the amount of power transfered to the pedals from such a wide base. I noticed right a way a postive difference in my pedaling speed. Since most of my rides are around 50 miles this difference was definatly appreciated.Word of Caution for those graduating from mountain pedals. If you dont get cliped in, forget about it. It wont be pretty. The slick surface of the shoe meeting the slick road platform ensures that you will slip right off of the platform. So be careful."

79957,0,"If you need a rack for your bike, this appears to be a decent rack. However, I honestly have to say that it's not quite as nice as my old Bontrager ""Back Rack 2"" that this one is replacing. Let's start with the good:- STURDY. My old rack only had two vertical supports, this one has three. Feels much more substantial. That's bad if you're a weight weenie, but good if you want to carry stuff and feel secure that it's not going anywhere.- MTX track system is awesome. This is the whole reason that I got this rack, so that I could use a Topeak trunk bag. This is also one of those good/bad things however, as the Topeak trunk bag forces you to use the Topeak rack - there are no attachments on the Topeak trunk bag at all other than the MTX rail (if they still included velcro tie-downs, you could strap it to *any* rack, which would be nice if you had more than one bike, wanted to loan it to a friend, etc.) I haven't actually used it yet (so I'm holding off on reviewing the bag) but it was highly recommended by someone who uses it every day and I was so impressed with his that I had to get my own - both because it looked sturdy and useful and also because you can literally remove it in seconds and just carry it with you, rather than leave your tools, spare tube, pump, etc. out on your bike when you lock it up somewhere. Trek/Bontrager has their own similar system, and I was tempted to go that route and keep my old rack, but reviews of the security of the attachment were not as good as of the Topeak, and just the bag alone cost as much as buying the Topeak bag and rack together. Also I was unable to find a store that sold the Trek bags, while several stores near me sell Topeak.- a nice byproduct of the MTX dovetail mount is that it covers your rear tire somewhat, so if you don't have fenders, it'll still catch some of the road debris that would otherwise be flung onto your back even without a trunk bag.But then there's the bad:- no height adjustment, which my old Bontrager rack had. This would be nice to be able to ""tune out"" slight heel strike if you happen to have panniers that are a little too long/far forward for your particular bike/rack/pannier setup. If you have a touring frame this is probably not going to be an issue for you, but if you have a road bike that you just want to put a rack on, it may be a problem.- screws and washers provided appear to be plated steel, not stainless. They're stamped ""9.8"" which means that they're high strength - this is good, but I hope the plating is good too. Rust = bad.- Only comes with one pair of straps to mount to your seat stay braze ons. And they're LONG. I'm either going to have to whack these down or just make my own out of some thick stainless sheet. I don't really need that long bit of steel hanging out over my rear tire not doing anything useful.- Lower mounting points are really chunky - good for strength, but they interfere with the heads of the screws that mount the derailleur hanger to the dropout, so I am going to have to get some more 5mm washers to space them out slightly so that they can be fully tightened down. Obviously I have not yet mounted the rack on my bike, only test fit it to see what I'm going to have to buy/make to make it work. If you don't have a bolt-on derailleur hanger this won't be of concern to you.- because of the lack of height adjustment, I'm going to have to put a really interesting bend in the straps to clear the straddle wire for my rear cantilevers (or again, just make my own) If it were height adjustable, I could just raise it another half inch, but...- taillight mount for a standard two bolt taillight is nice, which my old rack didn't have - it just used a single bolt for a reflector. However, you can get an adapter from Peter White for less than four bucks to convert the single bolt reflector mount to a taillight mount, and the Bontrager rack has tubing that overhangs the taillight to keep it from getting beat up. The Topeak rack on the other hand hangs the taillight mount way out in back with no protection, and in fact when the rack arrived the taillight mount was already slightly bent. It bent back OK and the powdercoat held so no real worries, but I'll have to be more careful not to knock it into things.So in short - if you want to use the MTX system, you need to get this rack (or other Topeak rack.) However, if you aren't mechanically inclined, you may want to just buy it from your local bike store instead and have them deal with fiddling with it.If you aren't buying MTX bags and don't think you will in the future, and just want a light duty rack, I'd actually recommend the Bontrager Back Rack 2 instead. That's the only rack I've seen with adjustable height and it can really solve some problems. I'm hoping that I'll like the MTX feature enough that I won't regret not keeping my old rack and buying a universal trunk bag instead."

Took the box into my house and opened it. I found the box to be approximately 3 times larger than the size required. Box contained no packing material. The mat itself is a very attractive design and is contained in a fishnet bag with draw string. This is my first exercise mat and I find that it is not wide enough (24""). Moreover, I find myself worrying about how long the foam/sponge material is going to hold up. Width and material type were presented in ""product description"", so I was forwarned. I also find that the shock absorbing quality of the foam is hardly apparant.

The set took over a week just to ship, but that may be an anomaly. This is something I will return.

186654,1,"I didn't actually purchase mine from Amazon; I got it used from Craigslist - local purchases save the environment! As far as the trainer goes: yes, it's a basic mag trainer that provides a bit of resistance. On to the review. First off, it's insanely easy to set up. Unfold, drop your bike's rear wheel in, tighten the axle up into the slots. Note: If you don't know how to change out a skewer axle then you probably ought to consider learning that if you own a bike! You don't have to use the provided skewer if your axle fits in the stand. I used my old mountain bike with no problems whatsoever. Second, twist the adjustment so the roller is against your rear wheel. Third, mount bike and pedal. A word of warning: depending on the type of wheel you have on your bike, you might encounter a great deal of noise/vibration. I swapped out my knobby tire for a road-ish tire (probably more of a commuter tire, but I digress...) and the noise is considerably less - I don't know why you would want to run knobbies on a trainer anyway. If you can, go ahead and get road slick tires for the least amount of noise. I just parked in front of the tube and watch movies, sometimes with headphones so the amount of noise doesn't bother me one bit. I also like the fact that the unit is pretty light so I can leave it attached to my bike and move the whole contraption out of the way when I'm not training. Right now, I don't have any cons but I imagine I may have more after using it for more than a week. I read other reviews that complained of little resistance - but honestly if you're such a powerful cyclist you probably need a more advanced trainer anyway. Don't be a cheapskate :)"

80088,1,"I use spandex shorts for running, to prevent chafing of the thighs and for general support. The last pair of shorts like these that I owned were made by another manufacturer and held up fairly well, but after a while the material started to pill and the seams began to fray and come apart. This pair from Eastbay is made of better material and is more securely stitched.The spandex/nylon material is of sufficient thickness to stand up to any stress you could apply, yet is very effective at pulling moisture away from your skin. The drawstring is sturdy and easy to grasp and tighten -- no fear of it disappearing into the waistband.Caring for the shorts couldn't be easier -- you can hand wash them in your sink then air-dry them, or throw them in the laundry and air dry them immediately after washing (no need for a trip to the drier -- the washing machine's spin cycle nearly dries them on its own.)If you're looking for a basic spandex short that is well made and offers longterm value, then this product is a great choice. In fact I'm thinking of buying a second pair since there are so many great colors.As for Eastbay itself, the service was prompt and they communicated the status of my order at every step along the way -- very professional."

212083,1,"I've been using this for about a month now together with a Lodge 3-quart enameled cast iron pot. I like them both and of course they've used for different purposes. This 8-inch skillet is a good size for cooking a small dish for one person like me. I've been using this pan mainly for frying dishes like eggs, fish, sausages, chilli, vegetable, etc. and so far it has performed well. Not 100% non-stick but it's not too difficult to clean.Here are just a few comments for future buyers.First, it can rust so requires more care than the enameled pot. Don't forget to rub in some vegetable oil after cleaning with water and wipe dry. I didn't put enough oil in the first couple of weeks and I saw a small rust spot so I tend to leave in some oil to season instead of wipe excess off with paper towel.Second, if you can, I recommend that you buy a matching lid. I read this from an earlier buyer and I found it to be an excellent idea. The lid keeps food smell off quite a lot even when frying fish (which tends to smell more than other food). It also allows you to use the skillet to cook food with liquid like bean soup or chilli. And it keeps the food warm for a long time, of course. A little note on the lid, though, is that if you want to fry something crispy maybe you shouldn't use it because water droplets from inside the lid will keep your food on the moist side, not crispy. Anyway, I like the lid - it's handy especially when sauteing vegetable.Third, a little bit on the minus side is that space inside the skillet is quite limited. So you have to manuever your food around and it means you cannot cook a large dish. But you know what, I think this smallish size is good as it keeps me from making too much food and so preventing me from over-eating !! For example, you can fill up some veggie and fish or a pork chop inside this skillet and the food portion will be enough for one person. So it's like a food portion control device for me:-)Fourth, don't leave your food inside the skillet after you finish cooking unless it has liquid. I accidentally left some broccoli, forgetting that a cast iron pan will keep the heat for long, et voila ! it burned.Lastly, I like this pan because it doesn't need much oil when cooking and so it's good for your health. I only spray some oil in or put a little butter and the food and veggies is good enough. But of course, I like to leave some oil in after each usage so the pan is normally oily.In summary, I think this pan is excellent value for money and I highly recommend it. The lid was more expensive than the pan itself but I'm glad I bought it as well. It was a good decision that I carried both the pan and the pot to Thailand !! (well, figuratively speaking, as they were checked-in:-)) They're worth the effort. I look forward to cooking with it more often in the future."
53346,0,"I was really excited about it, but it fell off my belt the first time I used it. Took a long walk, went to see how many steps I'd taken, but it was gone.

442231,2,this gun broke after the first shot i would not recommend this to anyone a waste of money
485214,1,"I bought this at a cutlery store, so I got ripped off, but I needed it then and there. First, it is a deadly and awe- and fear-inspiring knife. The pocket clip is very tight, sometimes hard to get slip over a pocket, etc., which is better than the alternative: cheap knives that slip out of your pocket. The clip is also on the wrong side for my use, but it's a matter of preference. The blade is heavy enough for one handed ""flick"" opening, and the disc thumb ""stud"" is ambidexterous. The handle is deeply checker-cut, so that it can be abrasive to the hand, but it is more slip resistant as a result. Mine was made in Taiwan (better than China, I guess), and the locking mechanism is interesting, new to me. The blade, like my CS Recon Tango, is utterly sharp, enough so to shave with, and to slice open a surface or target with minimal pressure or effort. Unlike most cheap, Chinese made knives that look somewhat cool, but are really cheap and flimsy--as likely to close on your hand and cut off your fingers as hurt an opponent--this knife is one you can be proud of; even if it isn't custom made quality, it's close enough."
402281,0,"This case appears to be well designed and constructed, with two substantial latches, a decent full-length hinge and a sturdy shell. However, the internal padding listed as ""high-density foam"" is very thin and light, and not what I would consider high-density at all. Plus, it's loose in the case and falls out when you open it, and does not wrap around the pistol at all, leaving it relatively unprotected and free to rattle around inside the case. For the price, I'm not going to bother returning it, but it was not up to the standards I expected. Too bad. A few extra cents invested in better quality padding and this would have been a winner."
253279,2,When I opened the new SOG Trident I was instantly put off with the overall quality of the knife. It looks great and the assisted opening function works well but the blade movement and play while the blade was open was far to loose and even worse: when it was closed(the play while the knife is closed causes the blade to scratch its self while in the closed and locked position). The knife needs metal liners to assist with the rigidity of the whole knife. Also the safety switch rattles when the knife blade is closed and can be very annoying. There is'nt a spring to quell the rattles. At a MSRP at $100 you would expect a blade that didnt have so much play in it and a few small refinement issues. My Benchmades have never had this problem. I have had some SOG expiriences and I do like SOG. I think I have gotten a defective product but the company has delivered on past occasions. I trust SOG but not the Trident. If you want a sold knife no matter what give Benchmade a look. Also keep in mind that Benchmade and SOG both have lifetime waranties.

499182,0,"QUOTE FROM:Product DescriptionAmazon.com Product DescriptionThe V700's patented magnetic-sensor technology is the same advanced technology used by GM, Ford, and Chrysler in their built-in compasses. A magnetic-distortion flag alerts you when outside interference is affecting accuracy, and the unit's smart auto shut-off feature conserves battery life by automatically powering down the compass when your vehicle is parked for ten minutes or more.___________________________________________________________________________This I highly dought about using the same technology -For one - using it with auto adaptor - leaving it plugged in - and You previously set it up prior the day before - Start the vehicle - and the compass goes retarded pointing more than the opposite way.I received it Feb / 05 - I almost returned it a week later - from constantly having to find a full circle space to rotate vehicle to reset it everyday - But I hung in there trying to figure out this problem - as a retired aircraft service tech - you tend to get fussy how things work from day oneWith the unit mounted on center of windshield - with vehicle off - and unit on - I try testing compass for interference - as quoted in top paragraph about a distortion flag - there has never been a flag -Unit on - vehicle off - I turn the key to on position - already the unit flips out of it's set coordinates - turn key off - unit returns to setting - Apparently - magnetic impulse of vehicle system energizing is enough to throw it off - I'm not starting the veh - just turning key to power up the dash - as starting sequence would be much more of a pulse. Turning on the turn signal - brake lights - etc - could also create a pulsed magnetic field.Remove unit from center of windshield - There may be a better spot that's more shielded.In the end - I found the ideal spot mounted on the windshield next to driver's door pillar - So far I have not had to reset it more than twice - and it's a nicer spot for viewing as well.In order to make this position possible - I went to local Best Buy to get an adaptor that has small profile plug to cig lighter where cord comes out at right angle keeping cords close to console - the other end has 4 ports and was easy to place on lower face of dash next to drivers door to make vertical approach straight up to the compass and anything else up there.It's the sticky Velcro deal - and may have to update to be more permanent.Also the cell phone has a new port now - VS the clutter in center of dash.For general use - I find it handy when out at night and knowing I'm going the right way after making unknown exits from the freeway - or just knowing I'm on the south side of the Mall at night.In no way is it as accurate as the GPS - Which I also use.Checking compared positions can be up to 20 - 30 degrees off and can be effected by any interference The balloon of magnetic fields coming from Your vehicle could be isolated to a point but would involve thin sheet film of metal embedded into a dash pad.If you want to know just how its performing - get a handy pocket compass - stand ten feet away from vehicle and compare position to the unit in vehicle. Do not park or set up compass near power lines.Making sure it's latched into it's holder is a must - The edges of mount have to be forced into groove of compass - this took me a couple days to notice - when it kept falling out.I purchased 2 of them - One as a Gift to an older gal in a wheel chair - and I wanted to be very informed as to what problems she may see before I ship it 2000 miles to her door.Have Fun"

The main complaint about sprays is that they are messy and they leave a residue. This one is less messy and leaves less of a residue. Overall, I probably prefer the tapes."
498543,0,"I would not recommend this product. It will give a knife a very sharp edge if you have the time and patience to perfectly sharpen your blade. The Clamp provided is difficult to hold and the blade moves if not tightened extremely tight. This leads to uneven and unsmooth sharpening. Even with the coarse blade provided, it takes forever to grind down the blade surface and remove any nicks in the blade. I would recommend using this sharpening kit after running your blades through an electric sharpener or a carbide sharpener. Overall, I am dissatisfied with my purchase. However, my sharpened SOG blades and kitchen knives will shave hair off my arm."

The rack is easy to assemble, sturdy, and convenient for organizing everything. I look at the other adjustable dumbbell systems and they look too complicated and not durable. These Quick Lock Dumbbells are robust and reliable. They work like the dumbells at the gym, assuming they have quality ones. No rattling with these babies, they become one solid unit no matter the weight. I got the 120 lbs. add-on kit to do one handed clean and jerks (if that is the right name for them). I did this movement (with 120 lbs.) on a balcony and felt confident that the dumbbell would not fall apart and fall over the railing. In the near future I will probably order the custom screws to get up to 160lbs dumbbells! Honestly I have been waiting my whole life to get something like this. Now I don't have to depend on a packed ""Globo-Gym"" full of annoying mirrors and ""more attractive than me"" people to use quality dumbbells."

However, the knobs to turn the sound up and switch between animal noises and musical notes are kind of flimsy and seem like they would break easily. I expected the toy to feel more sturdy. The music doesn't play for very long, which annoys my son. He likes the way the keys light up to the music, but loses patience when it stops so quickly, and in mid-note. I wish there were several songs, and that they played longer. It's also kind of an awkward shape for a small child. It tends to slide off my son's lap, so I have to hold it up for him. He then tries to slap it out of my hands. There's too much plastic octopus surrounding the keys, making it kind of hard for him to reach the keys easily unless I hold it up at an angle for him."

175692,0,"I put this gas tube on my 1955 Russian SKS. It was a little long and woud not go in the allocated spot. After about 50 swipes with a wide bastard file, it finally went in. I estimated that I probably removed about 3/32"" of material. Also, my gas piston had trouble sliding through the tube. The inside of the tube is machined poorly and the gas piston would slide in and stop and go more when I forced it, then it would slide freely again before grabbing once again. I corrected the problem by chucking up my gas piston in a cordless drill and coating it with lapping compund and ran it in & out of the gas tube at a slow speed for several minutes. I have shot the rifle since the installation. It shoots and cycles perfectly. The weaver mount is attached to the gas tube by 4 small screws and they will not stay tight. It came loose when I initially was file fitting the gas tube. I re-tightened them and when I shot the rifle, the screws instantly came loose again after only 5 shots. I will be trying lock-tight sealer on them next but it sure would have been nice if they came pre-coated with lock-tight from the manufacturer."
242974,1,"I bought these to wear around the house, we are having such a mild winter so far, not all the bitter cold.the shirt is made well it is very good quality, washing easily and care is a snap.If you wear a Large then order Large, as these do not shrink in the wash, they stay true to form.the reason I like Russell Athletic clothes is the quality and the price of Amazon.com.I wear a lot of these and I bought them all from Amazon."

385757,1,"I've used this for about a year now. It will indeed slip and rub on your tires if you don't get the clamp tight enough. It will also shift if you hit it with your leg while getting on or off. However, if you have the clamp on nice and tight it works just fine. I don't need any special tools to take it on or off.I have had a lot of weight in my panniers and the rack seemed very stable. Would I use it for a cross country trek? No, but it's fine for riding to work or around town on errands.The fact that it has a quick release is really nice if you use your bike for more than just commuting. I take it off on the weekends when I'm trail riding."
125527,1,"I received the bicycle in good order,but there was one flaw. The pedals are threaded left and right-handed to keep them from accidentally spinning off. My bike, however had both front pedals threaded right-handed. With only a Left and Right handed pedal for each rider, I was forced to purchase a set pedals from my local store before I could finish assembling the bicycle. I was not about to return it for such a simple flaw, but it was annoying, none the less."
104745,0,"I like this shirt, but it's more t-shirt material than knit style and weight.Not very dark black, just medium black.Made in Pakistan.Nothing like a more expensive TriMountain 100% cotton, but about half the price.Runs small; I usually wear a L, would need an XL after I washed it, although it might nottend to shrink up in length like the knit cotton shirts do (like 3 inches, but I'm not tall, so that suits mesince I tend to wear them out, not tucked in).Neck will hold it's shape, and I like it way better than the shirts I got from Kmart or Khols, which I returned.Looks like I'm in between sizes on this Rothco, so I'm returning it. If you are slim, then it might fit you,or order a size larger.I'm afraid this style cotton cloth won't shrink like the knit shirts (which tend to run big until washed)so I'm going to pass on ordering an XL."

494954,0,"I guess I'll be the ""Debby Downer"" on this product. In theory, this water bottle is great. But in practicality - not so much. Maybe mine was not put together properly. I got my son a kid water bottle (not cheap by the way) and on the first outing to the park he dropped it on the foamy cushy floor and the lid broke off. I wish you good luck with this product if you get it but know not to let it fall to the ground."

423336,0,"I've bought plenty of sets of these over the years. They're not horrible bearings in that they're relatively fast once you break them in, but they're incredibly fragile.The issue with their durability is that the plastic portion which houses the ball bearings and keeps them from touching breaks easily.I don't know why and I don't know how, but it's very common for that plastic piece to crack. A crack in that plastic portion doesn't necessarily cause the bearing to fail though. I have bearings that have lasted for ages with a crack and others which have failed due to the crack. Some bearings just completely fail in that the plastic housing practically explodes and large portions of it crack off and fall out.I can explain the 3 star rating I'm giving this product as such:The product is cheap and works, but you get what you pay for in terms of reliability and the lifespan of the bearing."

182111,0,Helmet definitely not for people with large size heads. My head meaurement is 57cm and helmet just fits my head but is a tight around temples. Maybe I'll get used to it but first usage is slightly uncomfortable. Foam is dense and hard so protective capacity appears to be high as head seems well protected. Hope I don't need to find out. BELL is a trusted name for me and bought on their reputation.

I did get an extra filter and a repair kit for that ""just in case"".Reviews are good for this unit and the black one. SO it really at some point comes down to just picking one.I hope to use this next summer.My main purpose in posting is to recommend getting a repair kit to go with. IT's worth the $20 because your filter is only as good as will last, if that makes sense. If it breaks and you're in the boonies, you're in trouble. So have the repair kit just in case."

184848,0,"When I opened the light to insert the batteries I was astonished at how lightweight the whole thing is---very lightweight. When I tried to insert the first battery it wouldn't go in properly because the spring that holds the battery in is so flimsy that if bent down-it was crushed. I had to bend it back to some semblance of the original shape to insert the battery.While I tried to do that, the components began to fall apart, the light element just fell out and dropped into the lining of my chair! It wasn't connected to anything! It was just resting inside the light cabinet. This really annoyed me. I located the element and after some struggles fit it back in the slot. Then I got all the batteries in without bending the other springs.I began to have some serious reservations about the durability of this product. Can you say CHEAP? I suppose we get what we pay for.It works (so far). I'm not that impressed with the quality of the light but I'll hold my breath. The whole apparatus could seems destined to fall apart on the next bump.This is not a solid device. Very light-cheap components-Americans expect something with a little heft. This ain't it.Note: a pedestrian brushed against my light today. The cheap plastic fell apart. The components scattered on the ground. I tried to put it back together again. Suffice it to say, this shoddy product no longer works. We get what we pay for. Avoid this product!"
344795,0,"This was from ""Santa"" to our grandsons. When my husband put it together Christmas Eve, the screw that held the pole to the stand was not long enough and the threads were bad.

1254,2,"Do not ignore the previous posters complaints about the size of these weights. I did! I'm a woman with a wrist 6.75 inches in diameter and I wear a size 7 or medium glove. These weights are extremely hard to get on and very uncomfortable to wear. I really think they are only suitable for a child or a very, very small woman.Also the weights I received do not look like the pictured item. Valeo seems to have changed the entire design of these. Maybe they were better before? The pictured item seems to have a larger diameter in the opening. The ones I got desperately need some elastic or something."

464420,0,"This bracer looks nice, and it seems to be made of leather that will stand up for a while. But a huge problem is, the product is supposedly ""hand made to order"", or at least that was the reason I was given when I asked why it hadn't shipped after three weeks. It arrived almost a month after I ordered it, a few weeks after the estimated arrival date. Another issue I took with it was the fact that it came dry and un-oiled. I have a lot of experience using, cleaning, and caring for quality leather products from my competitive horseback riding days, and for 40 bucks, this product should come well oiled and ready for use, considering how few materials are actually used in making it. That's what brings down the rating for me: poor shipping and poor treatment of the leather. Other than that, it fits well, it seems to be durable, and frankly it's pretty."
20092,2,"I have owned this watch for several years and have enjoyed it. I agree with the other comments. I want to add that now it is time to replace the batteries. You will need FOUR batteries at five dollars a piece. So the cost is $20 every five years.Then you take off the back and replace the batteries. A simple job unless the entire mechanism pops out. Trying to get it back in and working is impossible and I am handy with tools. A micro spring appeared on my work area. I have no idea where it goes or where it came from. When I finally did get it back together some of the buttons did not work. After many attempts I gave up. Also, once you break the seal by opening the back of the watch it is never quite as waterproof as it originally was.I have been a Casio fan since Casio started making digital watches. I have thrown this one out and plan to buy the solar model so I never have to deal with the problems and costs again."
420648,0,"Bought two of these. First one I ran over with the lawnmower. The other one is still around. Yeah, it's cheap and really just plastic tubing... but it works just fine. Good speed rope. I do double-unders in record time. 100 in 1 min, 17 sec."
198744,0,"I bought a No Fly Zone screen recently and it does exactly what it says it does. The No-See-Um mesh does a great job of protecting you from pesky insects, though I wish the hoop did a better job of keeping the mesh from contacting your face. Some insects, such as mosquitoes, may still be able to get their small mouth parts past the mesh and reach exposed areas that are in direct contact with the mesh though so far I have not found a single place where a bite was delivered while I was in the screen.The only thing I don't like is the bottomless design of the bag doesn't offer any protection and even with the stretch cord cinched down a person can wiggle out of the protection of the bag.All in all it is a good piece of equipment when combined with a quality sleeping bag and something to protect the bag off the bare ground. Very breathable, no waking up soaking wet from condensation forming up inside. Obviously not designed to give protection from the elements, nor is it marketed to do so."
362671,0,"The actual cleats were exactly as specified. They fit perfectly, but I did not realize that they did not come with screws. If this fact was noted in the description, I missed it. The cleats I replaced were from an a 1990 model boat, so the screws were machined into the cleat. Note that the Home Depot or Lowes does not carry the exact, flat head, screws to fit these cleats. You will need to go to a store specializing in hard to find hardware."
89080,1,"This is a really nice bar and well worth the money. I plan on buying another one in the future. Just one word of caution.I bought this bar for use with my Power Rack. I bought the 6' bar because the 7' bar was just too long for the spare room I have my Power Rack set up in. The spacing between the bar holding pegs of my Power Rack is about 44"". The spacing between the two collars of the 6' bar is about 43""(the information provided in the Amazon ad is incorrect). In short, the bar, because of the collars, won't fit properly on the pegs and thus can't be used safely with the Power Rack. I have a couple of solutions to my problem in mind.First, the collars are welded on to the 6' bar and thus can't be easily removed. I love the bar so much that I'm going to try and remove the collars with a butane torch (or some other type of torch). I hope to heat the collars enough to melt the sodder and remove the collars without damaging the bar. I don't believe trying to break the collars off with a hammer will work without severely scarring the bar. All I can do is try it and see what happens.Second, I'm considering just buying the 5' bar and useing the 6' bar for other exercises. The 5' bar is very short, but it would be just long enough to hold sufficient weight for the excercises I want to do. The only problem I can see with the 5' bar are the collars (again!). According to the Amazon ad, the space between the collars is just 36"". That puts the collars almost perfectly on the bar where I place my hands for lifting. I can't seem to win for losing!.Anyway, this is a great bar. Don't hesitate to buy it. Just beware if your using it with a Power Rack whose pegs are spaced 44"" apart.Mark"
372438,0,"When I bought this shirt it seemed pretty sweet, however, after one washing (cold water, delicate dry) it shrank two inches in length in the body and about an inch in the sleeves.

481900,1,"I've recently hit a point in my life where self reliance and preparedness has become a priority for me, so I'm new to the blade/gear world, keep that in mind if you're reading my review. First off this blade is sharp right out of the box, cuts right through that annoying plastic clamshell packing like butter. The SpeedSafe assisted opening is fast and smooth, I really like the flipper on the side for easy one handed use that isn't awkward at all. The Pocket clip is great and sturdy for my pants pocket, I wouldn't suggest using it on a belt though. The knife itself looks very non threatening and I wouldn't expect getting any second looks by others if I pulled it out and used on a small task in a public area, alternatively the fast action of the assisted opening blade could appear intimidating if you ever had to use it for self defense purposes. All and all a great blade that I plan to carry every day for a long time. Highly suggested, you won't be disappointed."
33672,2,"Had it for about 2 years, and lately the leather cover is peeling off and doesn't hold air like it used to when new. Majority of use was indoors, so I know I haven't been rough with it.

After geting caught on velcro, kiss them goodbye. With long hair, it will take 2 hair nets to hold it up, so buy an extra pack. They are better quality than the drugstore brand though. My current one was good for about 3-4 shows, better than the drugsote ones. and they have better color range."
117393,2,"I purchased this as a gift thinking I was getting a deal on the discounted price for something the description touted glowingly. The poker chips, yes, are great. The Mahogany wood case is junk. a solid build but came with surface scuffs which is a tell for what this might look like after a few poker parties. The lock and key are flimsy and didn't insert or turn easily. One of the wooden braces came unglued in the shipping perhaps. The interior black felt was filled with wood and packing dust. I didn't hesitate to return this for a refund. This wasn't worth the half price of $80. It's really something you might find at a Cheap Jacks near Macy's on 34th Street for $40, Maybe. So if they slash the price again in half you might consider it for your kids but definitely not a piece you'd be proud to show off to the family and friends.Respectfully submitted for your consideration."

273854,2,"I used this Pro Supex Blue Gear 17 as the Mains on my hybrid setup. I had a 660' roll of the natural color. The original roll had no issues when I strung it in a Head Metallix 4. After I finally ran out of the natural color Pro Supex Blue Gear 17, I ordered this blue color reel. It should be identical?? to the natural.What I found is that the blue color is more brittle than the natural color string and on 6 failed attempts to string the Head Metallix 4, the blue string broke at the same point (most severe ~130 degree turn at the throat of the racquet) on three different racquets. I tried using tubing but that broke too during the stringing. I am experimenting with replacements for the Mains. Right now I am testing (and liking) the Pro Supex Ultra Spin. It strings up with no issues and has a nice feel on the court."
14891,0,"Okay, heres what I think. I think that people that buy this gun obviously dont know anything about the sport. When it says 350 fps , it doesnt mean its good. And much less for 925$!!! For that price you could buy a Tanaka police model, gas operated for only 470$. Or if you will a Vsr sniper rifle for 270$. The tanaka shoots at 380 and th Vsr at 320fps, so the price doesnt mean its good. And dont say to me,"" Ohhh but th sellers page said it was ""cool"" Jajajaja, well, if you buy so easily an airsoft gun, just because it said 350fps or a friend of a friend of a girlfriend of your brother said it was cool, well, i bet all youre airsoft guns are broken from the first day you bought it, or if you turned a little smarter in the moment, you will learn that high prices mean good guns or ""cool"" guns. Oh, by the way who the... telled you that you could buy a real mp5 or two real aks, if you believed that, well, ive got two heads and no butt!!! An ak costs 3000$ to the state and an mp5 1500$. So if you wannt one, first you should have like 10000000000$ because youll have to pay an air passage to brazil, and then a bus passage to the black market and then another 5000$ for the ak or the mp5, so dont start saying some stupid things just because you imagined that the gu was ""cool"".

313663,0,"These are very comfortable gi pants. They are a good heavy weight, but soft cotton, not the heavy canvas type, flexible and easy to move in. I've had several different gi pants, and these are, by far my favorite. They are elastic waistband, rather than drawstring, but I prefer that. And as a female martial artist it can be difficult finding gi pants that fit well, but these are definitely the best I've worn.Update to this review: I had decided to purchase another pair of gi pants and ordered these again since I liked them so much the first time. Unfortunately, the gi pants that arrived this time were nothing like the first. The previous pants were brushed cotton, elastic waist. The pants I received the second time were the heavy canvas type material, drawstring waist, and had the ProForce label on the front, exactly what I did not want. I'm guessing the description is intentionally confusing because the pants come from different vendors and Tiger Claw has no idea what may really be shipping? At least I was able to return them without difficulty and was able to find another pair of gi pants elsewhere that fit perfectly. Just be aware when ordering the gi pants may be different than what you expect."
69465,0,These socks didn't actually keep my feet cool during my hike... I picked up a pair of wool socks from another manufacturer that did the job so much better and actually fit my feet more snugly. These were a bit of a waste. I do not recommend this sock.
384503,1,"Despite what the other reviewer says, this rack is very simple to mount. I saw one of these on a bike on the street and immediately wanted one myself. It has a very distinctive, solid look, and indeed it feels very sturdy. I would trust it with a decent amount of weight. Other seatpost racks look a little flimsy and silly. Also, given the angles they bend at, I imagine they would stick up into the air unless you have a really relaxed seat angle. Anyway, I posted some customer photos so show how it works. The only problem is that I don't have enough seatpost length to give room to put anything on top of the rack (my saddle gets in the way)."
397040,0,"Overall, it works good. The cadence, speed and distance all seemed accurate and are generally reliable. But it does have several big limitations:1) Doesn't work with a heart rate monitor: The signal from a heart rate monitor interferes with the computer's wireless reception. So if you are using a heart rate monitor, the computer doesn't work. Since there's a good chance you use a heart rate monitor if you are willing to spend this type of money on a bike computer, I consider this a serious limitation.2) The menu system is definitely not the most user friendly. In terms of when you're on the bike, most of the info is easily accessible. But you definitely need to break out the manual when you want to adjust any settings."

485238,1,As a hunter i have had many of these knives some i handed down even a few i lost and ive always maintained a good edge. Then before this season it was time for a new one so with the price being quite fair i ordered two they arrived fast at a first look i only noticed one thing the leather sheath maybe leather but not the quality of the past. I gave the two the paper test out of the box Just ok nothing amazing i put my egde on it and it was shaving hair off my forearm. I use these everyday and they do hold a fair edge for a while but not like the one of the past.Ive been told they are now being made in china which would explain the quality issue but all in all know one makes this style of knife at this price. Even with the quality issue id buy one again and i would recommend it to anyone the sheath if you get a little tray and throw some neats footoil in it and leave it over nite wipe it down the next day then you have a great sheath its worth a second look happy hunting Rick

484971,0,"At $288 it was a great price with free super saver shipping. They are delicate panels. The plastic around one of them already broke when it hit -10 below zero. I am waiting to see what happens next. The charger is very cheapo and delays the charge, but this was explained in the item description. It will run a boat trolling motor just fine on a sunny day hooked directly to the motor. Can't complain too much, unless the glass starts beaking too. THE SOLAR PANELS THEMSELVES ARE SUPER DELICATE and break very easily. Wind will blow the thing over with just a breeze. Quality doesn't come cheap. It's a great starter if you are looking to experiment into solar energy like me. I use it to light my chickens coops."

384393,1,"This sword, is more than I ever expected. To start off, the packaging that United Cutlery has utilized and manufactured specifically for the sword is amazing and fantastic. Second, the smell of a leather store greets you as you open the package rising from the genuine leather wrapped handle. The blade is stout, strong, and shiny with enough sharpness to ring as you run your nail along it. The blade is attached very securely to the hilt as well as the pommel. That pommel, well lets just say i dont want to get hit with that thing, solid nice, brushed looking metal. And then on top of it all, the plaque it comes with is top notch quality, wiht mounting screws and such. my only complaint isnt for the sword, it is for the paper with the mounting instructions on it. It is the size of two credit cards and the print is so small you cant even see it with a magnifying glass, but who needs paper instructions right?"

I usually wear a 13 to a 14 (in men's size) and these were more like a twelve or maybe a small 13 at best.As to perfomance, I cannot say as I had to send them back. I bought mine from Green Room Surf and they were totally cool beyond all expectations.They said that they don't know of any fin socks that run any bigger and told me most larger-footed folks just use a regular ankle-style sock, so I am going to try that out. Good luck!"
2476,0,"I needed a rack for 1 female bike and 2 children's bikes. Once fitted the first time, it is easy to take off and put on. I like the fact that I can loosen the bottom strps and pop the truck (with bikes off) out without having to completely remove the rack. Very sturdy and stable.I give it a 3 because the pre-molded, stationary stem strap sections that are below the arms make it difficult to put smaller frames in the middle or back (closest to car) holder. With adult male bike frames, this isn't a problem. I moved the two arms close together to fit the smaller frames, but it is still arkward for mounting and unmounting in the back and middle slots.I would not have purchased this holder if I had known the difficulty in handling smaller framed bikes."

There are no tricks or even organized suggestions in this book. It is a bunch of chat basically about being tight. I also bought Internet texas hold'em by Matthew Hilger and that book taught me tons. In fact my NL play improved as much from that book as it did from TJ's. Overall this book is a huge disappointment. It is repetetive and full of chatter which is interesting but can't improve your game. Send me $50 and I will tell you not to play KJ and Q10 in a NL game."
440448,0,"If you don't know better, these probably seem like an improvement over the cheapest karate scrubs available, but compared to quality middle-weights, these really do seem like cheap lightweights. I wanted to replace some quality middle-weights that use a drawstring with something equivalent with this type of waist band. In that regard, this type of waistband is much more comfortable than a drawstring alone. Another plus is that they have a back pocket. Their saving grace is that they only cost about $20.On the downside, as I alluded to, compared to real, quality middle-weights, these are thin, light and abrasive, being partially synthetic. They're more of a middle-ground between real middle weights and light weights. Additionally, unlike a lot of other quality pants, they lack any fastener for the pocket. So don't put anything in it if you're training (not that you should anyway).It's a ""for the money, they're decent"" thing."

34847,1,first of all this is a great company to buy guns from and the gun itself was unbeleivably acurate. The supplies it came with were good and the pellets were 1st class. the fps I would say is around 225-250 depending on pellets you use. I would reccomend this gun to anyone really Its light wont break easily and has great range and accuracy. the shipping only took 3 days and was altogether only 20$ WITH SHIPPING INCLUDED buy this gun
283137,0,"Service was excellent (which you pay for) but product was definitely mediocre. I bought this to use when the electric is out for most of a night so I can be sure to wake up for work the next day. Lantern is normal. Difficult to insert batteries and plastic housing is a little flimsy. Alarm clock seems to work fine, but to hear the radio I have to hold my hand against the side of the speaker??

The plastic internal frame also started cracking, so I made a small hole in the internal lining and removed it piece by piece.Pros:* Carry-on size* Zippered cover for the harness - keeps everything in place when you have to check the bag* Nice streamlined shape* External mesh water bottle holder* Great, well padded carry handles (top and side)* Removable shoulder strap (I never use it)Cons:* Heavier than other similar packs* Main flap doesn't open all the way - it needs to be held open when packing which gets a little tedious* Bottom ""compression"" straps don't compress as they are attached to the stow-away pocket for the harness cover* Zipper teeth are small and the zips don't glide easily* No ""quick access"" pocket for a 3-1-1 bag"

262997,1,This bottle works extremely well. I bought two. One we use the sport cap and the other we use with a separately purchased screw on cap.

510200,0,"I thought the quality was decent enough, especially given the low price, so no complaints there. I trust Bell products to adhere to at least minimum safety guidelines. I have an average size head and it was too loose for me and did not come with any additional padding to make adjustments, so I returned it knowing that a loose helmet is not much better than no helmet at all. I'm going to try another style."
284289,1,"There are some pros and cons to this watch. First the cons (let's get the bad stuff out of the way to begin with): The bezel isn't as tight to the watch as I'd like, and it can wiggle a bit, up to about 1/2 of a minute. The crown extends rather far from the case, so it and the horns have a habit of digging into the back of my hand slightly when I wear it (since I wear my watch on my left wrist. If you wear it on the right... no problem!). The movement doesn't stop when you pull out the crown (this is called ""hacking,"" if you're curious), which makes setting the time precisely a bit problematic. Finally, the day/date shift isn't all that crisp (mine starts the date moving at about 10:40 PM, with the actual click happening at 11:59, and the day begins changing over at 12:26, clicks to the Spanish day at 1:00, then begins changing to the next English day at 2:03 to click at 2:25!). Lastly, the luminous material on the watch is... well, not very luminous. It glows weakly for a couple of seconds on mine, but nothing like what is advertised. Finally, the rotor is a bit noisy on mine, although that might just be an indication that it needs to be serviced and oiled.A long list, but a list of very small negatives (I mean, aside from not hacking, everything else is minimal. How often do I need to know the day at 12:50 AM?).OK, now for the good stuff. For one, it's a darned nice-looking watch... the mother-of-pearl dial is iridescent in the light, the gold plate is rich-looking. On the mechanical side, the screw-down crown is quite large and easy to work (both for manual winding in the screwed-off position, and setting the watch in the day/date position and time-setting position). Additionally, the screw-down has a nice positive feel to it, you know when the crown has caught the screw on the stem, and you can feel it tightening (and, in fact, the logo is perfectly upright when the crown is fully screwed in -- a nice touch). The dial is uncluttered and easy to read, as is the rotating bezel -- which operates quite smoothly and cleanly as well, with a nice positive ""click"" as it goes through each of it's 120 positions. The watch keeps good time, it's within +/- 4 seconds per day as compared to a watch I have that's dead-on, but your mileage may vary on that account, as mechanicals tend to vary from piece to piece. The case's styling cues are obviously from the Rolex Submariner, with a couple of changes by Invicta to make it their own (different hands, bezel edge, hour markers, dial design, and the exhibition caseback). A nice nod to tradition that is a proper homage, and not a knockoff. And, as a nice bonus, the bracelet that the watch comes on? As nice a bracelet as I've seen on any diver's watch (including the Sub); solid links, great clasp with a retainer that gives a good tactile feedback when it's locked into place, and no hair pulling!That's a lot of positives; I know of a number of watches that cost more that can't boast as much ""good stuff.""All in all?For under $150, I challenge you to find an automatic mechanical watch featuring: day/date, 200 m water resistance, a bracelet that's half as nice, good gold plating (Invicta is known for having some of the best gold-plate in the watch business), and a mother-of-pearl dial.Can't do it? Then buy the Invicta."

206091,2,"I'm 5'4"" and ordered these XL so I have plenty of room for Tai Chi. Thing is, they really go down to my ankles. I don't usually wear petite sizes so this was strange. Also, the material is very thin, almost T-shirt thin, like inexpensive pajama bottoms. Had I not ordered them very large, I would have been embarrassed to wear them because they would show *every* *flaw*. As they are so loose on me they drape, as I ordered them, it's not a huge issue. I won't be returning them but chances are I won't be ordering any more, either.(Granted... they may be really long because they are too big, but I'm currently wearing a size 14-16 and XL is normally just loose. I've never had problems this bad with length before. I mean, look at the picture, I should have to go into 2X or so before they get long enough to touch the top of my feet.)"

163632,0,"Decent rack at a good price, but there are a few drawbacks. Not enough space between the two bikes . It takes a bit of maneuvering to get them both on without having pedals and handlebars interlocking with spokes. Also, the inside bike hangs closer to my trunk than I'd like and I have a nice new scratch to show for it. Lastly , it could use frame stabizers. On the up side, it holds the bikes securely with little wobble. It's a breeze to install and remove. It's really reasonably priced. If I had it to do over I would spend a bit more to get a rack that overcame these shortcomings. If you're not going to use it a lot, it's a good buy."
90961,0,"So I ordered the bell influx helmet and was excited to pull it out of the box. But imagine my disappointment to see the poor craftsmanship of what appeared to be a sloppy job in putting the helmet together. No matter, I'm not riding in a fashion show. Then putting the helmet on, it fits over all of my hair which is great, but adjusting the chin strap proves to be a huge chore. I enjoy how light the helmet is, and it surprisingly keeps my head feeling warm in the winter- but I would have liked a little more comfort and style to get 5 stars."

204551,0,"The raving reviews and convenient footprint of this treadmill sold me very quickly. This was a leap of faith since this product was not on the floor of any Denver area health equipment store. The design is sturdy, clean and well-engineered. The functionality of the control panel met all of my requirements....so I thought. For my purposes, only heart rate and an elapsed time display are necessary. I believe that these parameters are elemental to achieve aerobic value from exercise. Every treadmill in the galaxy displays this information side by side.....except this treadmill. Your display choices are CALORIES BURNED next to the TIMER or HEART RATE next to STEP COUNT. I don't understand the need for step count, sorry. To see either of the combinations, you must press the MODE button and switch back and forth. When you remove either hand from the side bars containing the pulse sensors, the heart rate disappears. So, unless you can activate the mode button with your nose while running at 6 miles per hour, you will lose the heart rate display as you switch then wait until the pulse sensor stabilizes. While there are programs that will sustain a constant heart rate, I want to see the number so I can manipulate speed and incline during manual control. This is an amazing oversight for a very high quality product. I am working with the distributor to find a solution...other than to buy a separate heart rate monitor or timer. When this happens, I will raise the rating from a 3 to a 5.Post Script ... The distributor sent an older control console that displayed heart rate and timer side-by-side. The unit was used, cosmetically blemished and had different exercise profiles than the originally shipped console. A manual detailing these profiles was not included. I sent it back and bought a nice count down/count up time at Target. My rating will remain a 3."

If I can do it, so can you -- but do check with your doctor first. Insanity is the ultimate workout! If you're not ready for a high intensity workout, this is not for you. However, if you want a 60-day program to kick your butt and help get you in the best shape of your life, go for it! You don't need any equipment, but you may want to get an exercise mat or carpet remnant to protect your floor. The key to starting with Insanity is to push yourself, but take rests when you need to -- Shaun T even tells you that in the videos. Everyone I know who has used Insanity has started out taking more rests than it gives you. You will sweat and it will seem ""insane"" but you will get results! This set of workouts burns a lot of calories -- as many as 1,000 per workout -- so you need to eat healthy. Another great thing is that you really can't out grow Insanity -- It's all about good form, reps and speed, and you can always push yourself to do more. So when you complete the 60 days, you can always start again and push farther. An outstanding program for anyone who is very serious about getting in great fitness shape fast!"

I changed USB ports, the USB cable, uninstalled and reinstalled the original software, and finally upgraded the software to the latest version. The pedometer still will not upload data. It seems to start the upload and part way through stops uploading and gives an error message. This message says the upload failed, try again. Repeated tries produce the same result. Also, the battery life of my unit is only about 1/2 of what the manufacturer claims. Otherwise, the pedometer seems to work fine. My time is too valuable for me to record the data manually, so the pedometer is no longer of much use to me."
426663,2,"The metal bracket which holds the plastic container is very difficult to line up with the small holes needed to secure the container. The metal is sharp and it is VERY easy to cut yourself trying to line up these parts. I used this system about 5 times in practice and in racing, and I always spent 10 minutes or more just lining up the pinholes. It was so time consuming that I would just dump the entire bicycle upsidown to get the liquid out before transporting the bicycle in my vehicle---then try to take the system apart once I got home.Even though I cleaned and dried the system between uses, the tube molded. Vinegar and a camelback brush could not remove the mold. The instructions recommended rinsing with bleach after each use, but I didn't want to be ingesting any bleach.The main screws attach under the bicycle seat. I thought I had mine on securely - it lasted a few weeks. Then on a ride, the container just FELL DOWN onto my rear tire. The screw sytem just vibrated itself loose. It uses two screws turned into square nuts, and there is no redundancy or second attachment backup. So once it vibrates loose, you're going to have a total failure.Since I was out on a ride when my Neverreach failed, I needed to ride one-handed and carry the failed hydration system with me. I spotted a trash can shortly thereafter and rid myself of the failed product.The rear hydration system is a good concept, but this product needs a LOT more refinement: Mold resistant tubing, better attachment method, ease of on/off, larger pins to hold the bottle on (so they don't get lost), metal that won't slice your skin easily, and a MUCH lower price!"

Leaves a slimy residue on the outside after you activate them.It stays on your hand and it's the consistency of squeezing a slug. Other than that it kept things frozen. I would probably lay down a towel under the packs so it doesn't get on food.

(Although they arecurrently offered at the home site with an additional free, clearlens)Overall, I was happy with the product, and at that price, it is one of the best options for new shooters to get into using different lense colors. I was happy I made the switch from using one pair of shooting glasses, to a switchable sunglass set. The different lenses really do seem to help out in different lighting situations."

192903,0,"This kit includes a medium-sized inflatable ball a pump and a book of 27 exercises. There is no video or DVD.The ball is suitable for persons from 5'6"" to 5'11"" (I just managed to fit) and so if you are SHORT you need a smaller ball. When sitting on the ball, your thighs should be parallel to the ground, or knees slightly lower than hips. Also, the weight limit is 400 lbs. The ball seems flimsy, however, softish rubber. If you are big, I'd recommend a durable ball, one that is listed as resistant to bursting, especially if you want to do more on-ball exercises.The booklet that accompanies the ball has 27 exercises and recommends 3 sessions a week, each followed by a day of rest. The exercises are geared to flexibility and building up strength, especially from using your balance.You need adequate space (maybe 6ft by 6ft?) and possibly a mat or other surface. The surface should be level and smooth but not slippery.The equipmentThe yoga ball is smooth, has some concentric ridges and a very definitely tacky surface, for getting a good grip. The ball is heavy-gauge plastic and requires that you pump it up to partially full, allow it to stretch overnight, then pump it to full tautness the next day. Full means a finger can make a 1 inch dent or so. It's about 2 feet inches in diameter when fully inflated.The pump is a double-action hand pump, as you'd use for a football. I instantly jury-rigged a foot pump instead to pump up the ball, as I find stamping on a pump easier than a push-pull type hand pump. This also means you will probably leave the ball inflated. So count on space for a 2-ft diameter ball somewhere in your apartment, house or dorm room.The booklet has 27 exercises, illustrated in black and white line drawings, and some charts.Strangely, the French booklet only has 24 exercises. Not sure why the Francophones are treated to three fewer techniques.The ExercisesThe beginners' exercises are primarily stretching exercises.1. Rock lower back2. Frog (hunch over ball)3. Shoulder Chest stretch4. Arm Raise5. Calf Stretch6. Leg Stretch7. Double Leg extension (roll ball up wall, extending legs)8. Tiger Pose (crouch over ball, stick leg out extended)9. Bounce and relaxYou aren't going to get fit doing the beginners' exercises, but you will get a good stretch and flex your back. If you have back issues, I'd show this book to your therapist or doctor first. No one wants to find you stuck to the floor on your yoga ball, back thrown out and you immobile! But it could happen, so do get advice if you have physical limitations. These are easy exercises, however, for most people, including the elderly. Oh, and did I say, you need a mat or a surface for this ball? You need something. A hard floor is not good--you could slip. Or your knees will object.Intermediate--require muscle strength, some flexibility--most people can do these, such as people who've been exercising in some sort of program for about three months1.Ab Crunch--standard crunch while lying on the ball.2. Reverse Crunch--lie on floor, legs on ball3. Wheel (this is fun) sit next to ball, roll back, arching over ball. Uses abs and is a good back stretch.4. Back extension--lift up using your small back muscles while lying prone on ball.5. Arm and alternate leg raise6. Incline pose (like a bridge)7. Crocodile (kind of a push up while legs rest on ball, you lying prone)8. Hip stretch (Lunge over ball)9. Single Leg Locust (back leg curl while lying prone on ball.)Advanced--require muscle strength, balance and flexibility. People who've been exercising over six months1. Side plank --lie sideways on ball and hold oneself up with one arm.2. Warrior Stretch--more advance lunge, from standing position.3. Cobra stretch (hold back legs out in space, while prone over ball.)4. Wheelbarrow (prone on ball, walk along on hands. Fun)5. Kneeling Frog (inner thigh stretch over ball, works inner thighs, risk of overstretching here.)6. Bridge--lie down, feet on ball, lift tush, not easy7. Table. Like bridge but even more difficult (legs on floor, head on ball, body makes the ""table.""8. Locust--double leg raise while prone on ball.9. Plough--lie prone, roll legs back over head until resting on ball.This is an inexpensive exercise program with possible benefits to just about anyone, but of course anyone with back or other health issues would need to consult a physician. The booklet is illustrated with about two pictures per exercise and some text. If you are an exercise novice, a video or class may be preferable. This is not exactly ""yoga""--but some of the exercises are based on yoga poses.Summary: This is a fun, relatively easy exercise program with challenges to shoot for. It's not aerobic (you'll need to incorporate walking or some other exercise for that.) There are some risks to consider if you have health problems."

19748,0,"I bought this tent in a rush before taking my two small boys on a camping trip. We used once in our woodsy property and again at a lakeside state park in Texas. Set up was a bit confusing at first, especially the entrance brim pole install. The second time we set it up at the park it went very fast. It is a really sharp looking and spacious dome tent and was more than enough room for two sleeping bags and a double inflatable mattress. Head room was very good considering this is a dome tent, and I could stand up in most areas. Ventilation was good, although a cold wind will get in the back window under the rainfly. I used a tent safe propane heater in 30 degree weather and it remained downright toasty in there. It also endured fairly strong winds and light rain overnight with no issue whatsoever. Now for the negatives. If this thing only had aluminum poles I would have given it 5 stars. The fiberglass pole joints use standard metal couplings between each section that snag on every sleeve which is a real pain given that the poles are very long and difficult to push through the tent sleeves while also fixing constant snags. One pole has already split on the end due to stress which is not easy to prevent given the length of the poles. Lastly, during the second take down one pole cord snapped without much stress being applied. It must have been frayed beforehand. So as the salesman said, ""fiberglass poles won't last long, aluminum are much better"". I'm returning this great design for a tent with better poles. Leo, Austin, TX"

My wife and I have four kids - now aged 6 to 13. The three boys can set it up themselves.We've been to the redwoods in nasty rain, to the beach in 30 mph winds, and in the hot sun. It's always performed well - the zippers are a bear - but have always been fixable and any snags in the seams always can be worked out. The poles have all failed, but minimal duct tape covers that. We rake the floor and have never had a tear. The kids have played football inside, but I stopped that before any damage occured, but the tent withstood some serious impacts before I threw a penalty flag.The front screen room is simply update with a section of astroturf, and the whole thing is easy to clean.When other families or friends join us, it's always party central for the kids. The room dividers worked fine until the football games inside.Pair the tent with a small tent fan or flashlight at the apex abd your good to go.I'm very happy with it overall, but you have to be a bit of a tinkerer to keep it going as long as we have."

114717,2,"I bought this bike as a beginning road cyclist that cycled as a form of transportation. This bike has been little more than trouble for me since I received it. At first, I was excited that the bike was quicker and rode more smoothly than the moutain bike I was used to. However, After about a month's worth of use, it started giving me problems. At first, I noticed that the numbers on the gear shifters did not match up with the actual gears. I was able to deal with this by making a mental note that if I put the shifter for my large gear halfway between one and two, I would be on the second gear, whereas if I put the shifter on ""2"", I would be in 3rd gear. However, it only got worse.The tires do little to protect the tubes within them. I had a flat tube within two weeks of use. I can understand that things like that happen from time to time, but it only got worse. Now, two months later, I have gone through three different tubes.I have also had problems with the wheels. Last week two of my spokes began to fall off. Then, I found today that my wheel has started to bend. After two months of use, I already have a bent wheel. The structure of the wheels is so weak that they don't do much prevent bends and warps. I would say that if you are going to buy a road bike, you should pay a little extra and not get a bike made by a car company that probably just wants you to drive in a car in the first place. I will never buy a bike from a dealer that is not a reputable dealer again."

94458,2,"...DON'T BUY THIS! Man. Why can't some people leave well enough alone? 2003 had better overall graphics and programming than 2004, and 2004 had better play mechanics. This one has graphics that ABSOLUTEY SUCK! The guys look like they are wrapped in plastic. There moves look like one of those half programmed conry games - they do not look realsitic like last years' game.I bought NHL 2005 and this. I like watching basketball on TV waaay more than hockey, but the Hockey game is waaaay better than this. Graphic wise and play wise. It boggles the mind why people would seemingly make an inferior product. What did they think - they were making a better game?Ok, they have all-star weekend. It does not do much good when the graphics suck. They are so bad it is hard to for me to even want to play it. These are supposed to be VIDEO games, not just games. VIDEO meaning they had better look good...I swear, the only reason I bought this is because Sega does not make it's ESPN for PC. If they did, I would never even bother with EA. At least with the last two, we got decent games. Although last year was virtually unplayable online. I asked them to give me one fro free and they refused. I did not want to buy a console because I know a new one is on the way. This time, I will get one just to play my sports games online, where I am the undisputed master(SuperbadCT). What a shame. It's the good thing hockey is almost as much fun.How can they make NHL 2005 look so good, but make this look like crap...?"

Very dissapointed, Taurus usually does a lot better than this. Well I am going to take the gun down and get it drilled and tapped for a real scope mount.

The main reason I like eco drive is the solar power allows the quartz watch to maintain accuracy and water tightness without ever having to remove the cover to replace the battery which leads to no longer water resistant. The reason I gave this watch a 3 stars is the chrono second hand (the red hand) was received not aligned to 0 second. It was always at about 59 seconds. Now after about 4 years of use, the second hand is now at 58 seconds. Great reliability but lousy quality control to ship with the second hand not aligned."

184336,1,"As I was needing a good bicycle helmet, I was pleased when I found the Bell Venture helmet. It's a good solid helmet which fits nicely with the use of a camming device at the rear of the helmet. Along with that, it's very stylish and very affordable. If someone asked me to suggest a bike helmet, it would be this one."

104300,1,I absolutely LOVE this product! They use it at the rhysical therapy place I go to. I loved it so much I bought one for home. I use it all the time. I have had 5 arthroscopic surgeries on my left knee and finally a total knee replacement last year. This is the single most helpful piece of equipment I have used. Thoroughly stretches my hamstring muscles. Recommended for everyone who has knee pain.
217743,0,"Ok,I bit. I had a cheap Costco tent before but the poles kept snapping so I thought I'd try something different. This tent seemed like a good deal and I had free shipping so I went for it. Just like the instructions say, it is very easy to put up - just like an umbrella. The frame is already part of the tent so you don't need to slide in those poles like other tents. The rain fly is pretty easy to put on so I was happy. Then I tried to put it away. It's pretty easy to bring down as well - just like an umbrella. The hard part is folding it and getting it back in the bag. Like a road map, I just can't figure out the secret. Basically, it is now folded at twice the size as when I took it out of the box. I tried for almost an hour but couldn't get it back in the bag. I can't even get it back into the box to send it back. Darn thing is like tryng to fold an octopus. Anyway, puts up easy, comes down easy, impossible to get back in the bag. Since it's a car-camping tent I can live with this problem as I just need to find a bigger bag and some more patience."

199591,0,"For the price, this biking computer is very tempting. I wish I could say that I really liked it, but I've been having a lot of trouble figuring out how to mount it properly. Schwinn must keep their price for the computer down by offering very little mounting help (it's done with cable management i.e. zip ties). The computer itself is actually very easy to mount on your handlebars but the magnetic sensor which reads a spoke sensor (for speed, cadence, etc.) must pass within 1mm of each other AND the sensor can be quite, well, sensitive. You have to make sure the magnet hits on the RIGHT PART of the sensor. We put the magnetic part on the spoke of our front wheel and picked it up and free spun it to test it out but got no results until we moved the sensor to the very bottom. There is an arrow beveled onto the reading part of the sensor which shows you exactly where the magnetic part must pass by and you have to be VERY precise in order to get it to read. As of now, we were having so much trouble that we just disconnected it and will try again at a later time. I'm sure this product will be great once we mount it, but that process could've been engineered a little better in the first place in my opinion."

486897,0,"I bought this yoga mat because I needed one to do floor exercises for my workout dvds. I read the reviews on multiple mats, before finally settling on this one. After using this mat multiple times, I realized that it does not fit my purpose. I work-out in my bedroom, which is carpeted. I wanted something to provide some extra cushioning, which this mat definitely does. However, whenever I am working out and start to sweat, it's almost pointless to try to do anything on the mat. If I try to do leg raises, my body starts slipping down the mat. The same goes for push-ups and planks. My hands start to slip. The only way to prevent from slipping is to put down a towel to provide some traction. This mat is good if you need some extra cushioning and are doing less rigorous workouts. Other than that, I wouldn't buy it."
193035,0,"This product is great for the price. It's small, portable, and simple to use. It would have been nicer if there was a coating of rubber on the finger pieces for comfort. Be careful on the difficulty level though. I'm pretty fit so I figured Heavy tension would work well but it isn't very difficult. I know this may have just been my case but when I read ""Heavy Tension"" I expected a challenge. Nice product though."

306116,0,"In almost all respects, this is a nice yoga mat. When you pick a color, just be aware that one (maybe more) mat is not as described. I ordered the 'light green' color, and it's definitely turquoise. Really vibrant turquoise. It looks nothing like the color swatch (which looks light green) or the mat identified as light green in one of the seller photos (which looks light blue). Otherwise, as far as functionality goes, it's great!"
237468,1,"I've bought athletic socks that were supposed to be high end, but never ones as good as these. Love them. They're sturdy, well made, well padded, and look to last a lot longer than bargain brands. Next time I need athletic socks I'm buying more of these."

321747,0,"I bought this coat in both blue and green - after reading the reviews that it does not have side pockets. I bought them at REI as they were on sale for 114.00. The colors are amazing - and on the first day I wore the green one I got compliments from almost everyone I ran into. I skied in it at Breckenridge in sub zero temperatures and it kept me very warm. I just make sure when I wear it I wear something under it that has pockets - ie: A down vest or a hoodie with pockets to keep my phone etc. If running around town it is not as big a deal as I usually have my purse.So as long as you are willing to deal with the no pocket part - it is a really, really cute jacket, very flattering, great colors, and suprisingly warm. However having said all of that I would not buy it unless it is on sale..."

303090,0,"I actually bought the DVDs from a seller on ebay. Completely legit, buy it now, brand new in the packaging. The workout itself is fantastic. I feel great, my muscles ache in a good way, and my clothes are starting to fit better. I have only had the series for a week. The whole program is a great program. However, the quality of the physical DVD and the video is garbage. With the exception of the first DVD, all of my other DVDs skip, pause, black out, wobble, etc. Before buying the series, I read other reviews with similar complaints, hence why I chose to buy it for 80.00 off of ebay. The only thing that is saving it, is so far all the technical difficulties have not messed up the actual workout enough to really make a negative difference. That being said, this workout is worth the money. I have exercised before and this makes me sweat quicker then any workout I have ever done."
75147,0,"I can only give this seat 3 stars for now due to fact that I have yet to put my baby in it. As soon as it was given to me I was concerned w/ all of the poor comments about installing in a small vehichle. So out to my car, w/in 5 min. I had the base installed, leveled and ready to go,using the seat belt to attatch. The base didn't budge when I yanked on it w/and w/o the car seat attached.(Now of course I read directions before I attempted since I have no clue.) Also my car is a'95 nissan, 2 door, so far there seems to be plenty of space for this seat. Also I read issues w/ the matching stroller fitting into trunks, once again I have a nissan and the stroller fits more than fine in my trunk."
268519,1,"This Jeep Bike is very well made and comparable to other bikes costing much more $$$. Upon inspection, I detected no sloppy workmanship even though the bike was made in China. After some minor assembly, I hit the streets and trails and I have no doubt this bike will hold up well over the years. The front disc brake is a great added safety feature to consider when purchasing a bike. Now if we can somehow produce here in the U.S. a quality made bicycle that would rival the prices of the Chinese made imports. Perhaps in a few years - - - - anyhow, this Jeep is a great value for the quality construction and ride!!"
365761,0,Good Socks. They seem to be making them a bit smaller than before.They don't last as long as I would like but are better than something you might buy at the super store in a plastic bag.Can't bring myself to spend more on socks than this. Still the best bet for the money
67254,0,"Fits on the wrist very comfortably, and release mechanism works. But it ain't anything special. Just what I needed, and nothing fancy. I like the camo color, though the logo is annoying, planning on ripping it out or putting tape over it."
2556,1,Recieved this product in a timely fashion. Setup takes a little bit of time to get it right. I used the rack to carry 3 bikes from Ohio to Cape Cod without difficulty and it held up very well. Just be careful to watch your head when you shut the trunk if it is attached to a van.

276012,2,"Was excited to get this backpack in red at such a great price. Turned out not be to what I expected. I see that there are pics now that clearly show the back/straps. There weren't any when I bought it. The back felt and looked like the bottom of a tent and I knew the moment I saw it that it would heat up. (A big deal in Arizona where it's 104 in the shade.) Was expecting some breathability, like other High Sierra's I've seen. Guess you get what you pay for. And just to make it an all around pleasant shopping experience (sarcasm), Amazon charged me for the return. Apparently it's a new policy that if you don't like the item, you pay."

75620,0,"I bought this respirator exclusively for work in woodworking-dust. Unfortunately I relied on all the reviews. However, upon receiving the mask and the P100 filters, I do not see any mention of dust. Paint, pesticide sprays/vapors, muratic acid,lead abatement,asbesteos, and mold, but no mention of dust. Don't try and call AO Safety I tried until I gave up. Definitely, lousy customer support or maybe they are overwhelmed for customers wanting clarification? So if you are looking for something better than a regular dust mask, make sure this product is for dust. By the way, you can see this product and filters at Home Depot paint dept. They have other filters but none for dust."
34827,0,The only thing I did not like about this product is the way it was made in the area surrounding the neck. It seems that the design is for a child not an adult. The width of the opening is not very big and has a seam where the nylon cover is stiched right at the nexk line. This creats an uncomfortable rubing against the sides of the neck. Other than this complaint the quality of the construction looks very good.
38322,1,This is the first non cotton uniform I've had. It is very well made with a great fit . The pants are not so ridiculously high waisted. Only drawback is that they are a little hot. I have a pair of mooto Extera pants that are much cooler. Still a great uniform.
155204,0,my son is pretty skinny and we got the size that was recommended for his height/weight. the whole thing is one piece so it was really difficult to get them over his leg and they were very tight so that they left marks. I would have gotten the smalls instead of xsmall if i had known they were going to be so tight or that the elastic was going to be one attached piece. some of the ones i looked at the store had velcro closure (or something like that) anyway... they did what we needed but we won't get another season out of them.
213914,1,"I purchased this for my Interarms Walther stainless PPK from the mid-1990s. I did not expect to see it for 30-60 days. It showed up in the mail, from Israel, in less than two weeks! I do not know how it fits the Smith and Wesson Walthers. But it is an excellent fit for my Interarms PPK. It provides a positive ""lock"" when I insert my PPK. However, it is not so firm that the pistol is not easily removed. Using a firm, confident and straight-upward draw, the pistol readily disengages from the holster. I have no concern that the gun could fall from the holster if I was to be upended. Nor am I worried that someone else could easily snatch it from the holster. The holster seems very sturdily built, having a simple but very functional design and it is very well constructed. I think it is a tremendous bargain. My only concern (and not for my PPK) would be if you use a Fobus holster like this for a blued-finish gun. The pressure-points of the holster which hold the gun in place might cause premature wearing of the blued finish. But that is only a theoretical concern to me. I have no actual experience on which to base it.On my right hip the holster provides almost no print with a jacket or heavy sweater covering it. The paddle slips easily inside the pants waist band and has an offset design that somewhat ""clips"" against the pant material just below the external belt. It can easily be adjusted along the waist band for different postions. And the two small ""teeth"" on the offset rim grip the pant material (without puncturing it) to hold the holster in place. Pull the waist band outward, press the hoster inward with a slight twisting motion and the holster is readily removed. It appears that it would hold up well to many years of normal use. And it is very comfortable. I barely feel it when wearing it with my PPK inserted. All-in-all a very practical and somewhat ingeniously designed and manufactured holster.The price and service from Amazon were excellent as is the product itself. I would heartily recommend this holster for the Interarms Walther PPK."
153137,0,"I've installed several brands of cork tape (""gel"" and non-gel) as well as some faux leather tape (Torelli Moda Chunky) and this Microtex is by far the most difficult to install. The material is not very stretchy, and I had to re-wrap a couple of times because I would get wrinkles in the tape.I have not been on any lengthy rides so I can't comment on comfort and grip although in the short term it feels comfy and grippy enough.In terms of looks, I have mixed feelings. The white backing shows through perforations and sides and I almost feel like it's a cheap look. I will update after I go on longer rides, but I kind of wish I went with a regular cork tape.I'll update this after a couple of months and hopefully a number of miles (If I can remember to)."
17317,0,"School Gold is accurate color. Quality is so-so. I accidentally tore them while getting the wrapper off with a poke of the sissors. It immediately shredded into two dime size holes, opps!

244606,1,"Gladly, I have no evidence that the Kryptonite Evolution STD Bike Lock has actually thwarted any potential thieves. However, it certainly looks as if it would make a thief choose a different target. Holding the unit in the locked position, one cannot feel any play, or hear rattling from the joints. The key and lock mechanism have worked smoothly every time. The key only releases when in the locked position. Because it always turns smoothly when locking I feel the chance of bending or breaking the key is effectively eliminated. By the way the key come with a small flash light built in to it. I have been grateful for the key's light on several occasions. The STD sized Evolution lock has allowed proper locking in situations where a smaller lock might not have worked. The mounting bracket connects easily to your bike either inside the frame or on your seat post. I like that you can feel and hear your lock ""click"" into the mounting bracket. However, even when securely mounted the bracket allows the lock to sway side to side when riding which constitutes a minor annoyance. My experience with this lock would warrant a rating of 4.75 stars."
4939,0,WOrks pretty good for a small crowd. The cards are to small so you may want to purchase larger ones. You can only get 4 balls out at one time before they start to catch on the release.

469886,0,"My exercycle (Schwinn 203: same as 201 but with larger display) was purchased in Jan. 2005 to supplement my road and mtn. bike rides whenever there were time limitations or inclement weather. It has worked well in maintaining my cardio, leg strength, and overall fitness levels.This exercycle is HEAVY so I'm glad UPS didn't cause any damage. It was relatively simple to assemble by carefully following the instructions. The base is stable and has small wheels in the back cross bars to provide some mobility for storage. Quality is average but that's expected at this price.Likes: Comfortable reclined sitting position easy on the lower back and perineal regions. Great for maintaining cardio and leg strength. Watch TV, read a book, chat, etc....during workouts. Exercise anytime at home without the chance of cross contaminations from public/health club equipment.Dislikes: Heart rate monitor gives erroneous readings occasionally and only works with both hands on the sensors. Flimsy wiring. The magnetic resistance unit developed some thumping noises after repeated uses at high cadences. Speed doesn't correspond with power output, e.g., level one (90watts) at 100rpm ~23mph; level six (260watts) at 100rpm ~23mph. Lower power output (watts) should equal slower speeds. Stock platform pedals not smooth and required bearing adjustments.Overall: Very useful adjunct to regular outdoors training. NOT a true ergometer but good for simple evaluations of one's cardio and strength fitness levels. Fair price but questionable long term durability."
390119,1,"This beginners kit was extremely helpful - I love my mat! The DVD with Rodney Yee is amazing, the daily workout is re-energizing and just what I need after a long morning. There is an aspect of workout and meditation to it so you get the best of both worlds. I have no regrets!"

The pop off cap where you put the water in is hard to get off, but pops off if the bag is too full. The spout leaks. There is zero water pressure, so there is no ""shower"". It's just a trickle. It's so heavy that you have to hang it on something really high and sturdy to get it high enough to rain down on you- or you have to be on your knees. I ended up washing up with hot water from the stove because this wasn't even worth trying to use. I'm going back to the store to see if there is a camp shower with a twist off cap and maybe a 3 gallon capacity. I do not recommend this at all."

This little tent is very easy to set up (for backyard use) and super easy to move around. I would often change the location during the day, so the sun would be shaded from our skin. It was a blast while it lasted. However, only lasted one summer for us. I would bring a baby bathtub full of water and toys to set inside the plastic base area (nice feature too). Our young kids would splash around and keep shaded from the sun. The cabana worked well for daily use. Kids never messed around with the outside, only played under the shade. The problem with this tent, is the material is pretty thin. Right away it started to tear away from some of the pole areas. The tears didn't grow too fast, by the last weeks of summer, it was on its last legs and had to be thrown away. We only paid $23 (free shipping) for this tent, so 3 months of fun in the sun, was worth it. I wont be buying this one again, for this summer. Instead I saw Amazon selling another brand and it has better reviews for only $10 more. Hopefully, I can get 2 summers out of the next cabana I order."
395672,2,"I purchased two of these leaders for a trip to the Boundary Waters. The swivel was an interesting design I had not seen before and was a little clumsy to use the first time, but it looked secure, so I was happy with it overall. After a few casts, I hooked into a nice pike and as it came close to the canoe, the line suddenly went slack. I pulled in my line expecting to to see the leader missing, but it was still there...the swivel had come open! For an expensive leader, I expected much more. This leader cost me $6, the lure was another $6, the fish was priceless, and now I had to spend the rest of the week minus one of my favorite lures."
99811,0,"I read many reviews on this watch, and the one thing that I saw over and over was the complaint that the HR wouldn't display during an activity, such as running. The runner had to stop to get a reading. I took a chance since I would either be walking or on an exercise bike, but lo! I'm even having the problem while walking and while simply sitting on my exercise bike with my legs pushing the pedals. I rarely get a reading while still exercising at a very moderate rate. It seems the watch only cooperates when I'm still.Despite this problem, I like the watch. All the features work well, aren't too hard to program, and work well for me. The watch is bulky and quite large on a smaller wrist, but there is a lady's version available. I made sure to buy the Mio that offers the interchangeable strap, which is a good thing. One other reviewer complained about the strap breaking on another Mio with no way to replace it. I can see how that would happen over time. The plastic used on the band is rigid and with the bending of putting the watch on every day, it appears it won't take long for the plastic to break.Overall, I find it to be an acceptable HR monitor with limitations that some, however, might find unacceptable."
15051,0,"I have had the 9 lb. Momentus Strength Trainer for several years. At first, I used it exactly the way it said. You have to grip it a certain way, you have to go to different stations in your swing, etc. All that works pretty well, I was hitting the ball longer than I ever had. Then, I started to do full swings with it to see if i could really swing the club hard. What i found was that the weight of the club was so much that it took me off balance, and that led me to being off balance on the golf course too. I put the swing trainer away and started working on my balance. I've been working working on balance for the better part of a year, and have just gotten to where I am on balance with all but my hardest swings.I really like the strength trainer, it did help me get stronger through the hitting zone, and I did gain some length on all my shots. Yes, I will go back to using this, but will only do it in the prescribed method from here on out."

Instead, the tight fit ensures the best hearing protection, and the cups are soft so they are comfortable.

484611,0,"I had originally purchased this because it was a multitool and I intended to use it as such. The wrench portion actually does not work too well. It is very loose and only works on small nuts. You're essentially better off using another wrench although for an emergency type of situation it does serve its purpose. The bits are tiny but they do work well. Having any emergency/multitool screwdriver can definitely come in handy so that is a plus side to this tool. The LED light is useful although I have not used it much and I prefer to use a LED that I have on my keychain that is MUCH brighter. Again, for emergency type situations it does serve its purpose. The bottle opener does exactly what it is supposed to do so no complaints there. Now for the reason that I give this a 3 star rating. The blade is small (about 2 inches) but is very sharp and very handy when you need to use it (opening boxes, sharpening, cutting, etc). However, after having the tool for about a year the blade broke in half! I was very disappointed because up to that point I had used it very frequently (mostly for the blade) and that may be why its life was so short. I've had ""multitools"" in the past and I have never had a blade break on me although I've had other situations where the blade is no longer sharp or the pivot breaks. I don't know if I'm going to purchase this again and I am definitely going to be on the lookout for a multitool blade that lasts me more than a year."

After my second ride I came back with a pretty heafty thorn in the tire. I pulled it out have a big of grief that I was going to have yet ANOTHER flat tire. To my suprise when I went out the next afternoon to ride it was good to go. Normally I truly believe the other brand I was using previously (that was quite a bit more expensive) would have definitly left me with a flat tire.

455898,2,"Since the Amazon description included:""Offering a great introduction to pogo stick jumping, the Flybar Maverick junior pogo stick is ideal for the young beginner""and""Designed for children between the ages of 5 and 9 years old""I thought this would be perfect for my 5-year-old granddaughter. Rather, it was a big disappointment.She had so looked forward to the day when the pogo stick would arrive, but when it did, we discovered that she was not heavy enough or strong enough to compress the internal spring, and is totally unable to make it work. Her older sister, who is 9 (and not small for her age) also had a very hard time getting any bounce out of it.This is hardly designed for a ""beginner"" or a child ""between the ages of 5 and 9."" It is only operable by a rather stout older child who has, perhaps, never been able to turn down ""super-sizing"" their #5 at McDonald's. One has to have quite a bit of weight and heft to get some compression and bounce from the blasted thing. I weigh 175 ponds, and just standing on it, I couldn't get it to compress fully.All that having been said, it is sturdy, well-padded, and attractive. That's good because I fear that my granddaughter is relegated to enjoying its aesthetics for the next few years until she is big enough to actually operate it. I'm thinking it might be best enjoyed as a wall-hanging."

454362,0,"I really wished this would have worked for me. I thought the chest strap was optional but it's not.

I do a lot of high intensity exercise and while jumping around, running, or anytime I would raise my arms in the air it would not stay in place. Even if it moved slightly it wouldn't read my heart rate properly. I felt like I was spending more time adjusting the strap then actually working out.

I am 5'2"" with a 28"" inseam. I prefer more room between me and the handlebars, and I don't like my knee coming up so high when I pedal.My husband said I looked fine riding it, that it seemed a good size, but I felt like I was riding a kids' bike and just didn't feel comfortable- I would have been embarrassed to ride it in front of people, and I felt like I was teetering on top of the bike and didn't have as much control because I was so cramped between the handlebars and saddle. I also wanted the more upright position of a comfort bike, but when the frame is too small I have to adjust the seat up higher and that pretty much changes that position because handlebars can't go up quite as high. I'm going to go to a regular size and just keep the seat down farther. I would consider this a perfect girls/very small women's bike."

It doesn't bother me very much, but it might if my seat were just a little bit lower.The only other issue is that you really have to tug at the basket to remove it. Sometimes I ask someone else to hold onto the handle bars of my bike for me while I pull it off, which gives extra leverage. When I'm alone, it can take a minute.All in all though, I like the mounting system and the way this basket looks, and it has held everything I've put in it.

302635,0,"P90X has been marketed as a revolutionary way to train. The packaging and marketing might be new, but at it's core P90X is a mix of well-established weights training & fat loss principles and more simplistic, mainstream solutions. Will this program help you lose fat? Yes. Will it help you build muscle? No, although you will get stronger and leaner; any other increase in muscle size will be due to increased blood flow. Will this program let you get ""ripped""? That depends on your bodyfat percentage; there's a limit to how fast you can lose fat. Summary? This is a program of moderate usefulness, but it's clouded by misinformation and poor structuring to appeal to a market. There are bigger, better and more effective things out there.WEIGHTS PROGRAMThe weights program here is a mix of various existing principles. Each weights workout is based on a strength circuit training structure, where you complete various different exercises one after the other, sometimes repeating the circuit and then starting another. There are two basic sets of training routines used at different points, with one set using antagonistic muscle training (ie, using a push muscle group(s) and a pull muscle group(s) in the same workout), and the other using same muscle group training (ie, using only pull muscle groups or push muscle groups in a single workout). These are split across the different phases of the 90 day program.However, whilst these types of training and tried and proven as muscle gainers, they're not very effective in this program. Why not? Well, it's a mixture of time, diet and the exercises contained within the program. This is a 3 month program - even lifting heavy weights, eating lots with a proper diet and using all the right supplements at all the right times, the best even the most genetically gifted can hope for is a kilogram of muscle growth a month.However, this doesn't really matter if you do follow the program, because you'll be eating at a caloric deficit and losing fat. Gaining muscle and losing fat is notoriously difficult, and eating at a caloric deficit will result in small muscle losses. The weights training will, hopefully, more or less restrict the damage to minimising muscle loss, and in some cases resulting in a little bit of muscle gain.All of this is beside the point though, because the weights program isn't too great. This is partly because of the marketing strategy, keeping everything fresh, and as a result a few of the weights programs become clogged with inefficient or unnecessary exercises. But even then, these weights programs are mostly a mix of bodyweight exercises or light weights, with the intention of making the program more cardio-oriented, as well as aiming for a ""burn"". The bodyweight exercises are great, but sooner or later you need to add weight to them otherwise it's just a matter of conditioning your Central Nervous System to repeat the same exercise, instead of getting stronger.The lighter weights exercises are aimed at hitting the same muscles from other angles. But in keeping with the program, too many different exercises are added for some muscle groups to keep the structure, or too many new exercises are added to hit the same muscle groups for the sake of keeping things fresh.But that's not the real problem with the weights program. The real problem is that it's implementing an advanced weights training routine. Unless you're already reasonably fit and strong, or you're a beginner or intermediate lifter, this programs complexity will be too much for your body to handle, further hampering muscle gains. This isn't a program that will be helpful to the majority of beginners, and intermediate or advanced lifters will already have more effective ways to train.There is no guide to form. This is worrying, as some of these exercises are landmines for injury, and the potentials for such hazards are poorly explained. There is the occasional ""watch your form"" from Tony, and there is the visual aid of the videos, but they're not explanations, and it's all too easy to stop paying attention and ignore those risks.Then there's the plateau effect. P90X is marketed as a way to beat it. Instead, this program addresses the problem poorly, instead of providing a solution. People plateau because they overreach. People overreach when they push too hard too fast in the weights room either because they don't understand what they're doing or they won't leave their ego at the door. And instead of lowering the weights used and practicing proper form, people continue to do the same thing again and again. I know this, anyone who's frequented a gym will recognise the people there who've worked out for years and never made progress. Whilst changing a weights routine can often be a solution, it is not THE solution. At the very least, training and raising weights properly, nobody should plateau for a minimum of 3 months.By contrast, P90X changes every 4 weeks, with only 3-4 consecutive weeks of the same training, with the focus on lifting as much as you can. It's pushing the same cause of the plateau effect, but changes so frequently so to hide the effects.Well, what about the actual weights routines themselves? For a start, the weights training for legs is abysmal. Only one day a week for training what are the most powerful muscles in the human body, and all the exercises are focused on quads - no hamstring or glutes, with only ONE exercise for calves. This is, frankly, appalling - legs are often the most undertrained parts of the body, despite making up the entire lower half of our bodies. 50% of the body is instantly neglected. Furthermore, there's no change in the legs routine - you'll do the same thing for the duration of the program. Various studies have shown that training the legs - specifically, by squatting - is the most effective way of promoting Central Nervous System activity; that is, the most effective way of heightening metabolism and promoting muscle growth. That legs are neglected is scandalous.The rest isn't so bad. The chest, back and ab exercises used are all excellent, although they offer little in the way of post-program progress. They provide various levels of variety and difficulty. There's nothing wrong with the specific exercises used in the program, though the back exercises that use weights certainly need to have form explained - keep your back straight, or else you risk the threat of a lower back injury.Biceps, triceps and shoulders are more sketchy. Some of the exercises are good, but there's far too many repetitions of the same basic movement, and some of the exercises - especially the shoulders - risk injury if done incorrectly.Overall, i'd say that Chest & Back, and Ab Ripper X, are both exceptional, and Shoulders, Biceps & Triceps is pretty good too. The other three weights programs aren't recommended.CARDIOThe cardio component of P90X is one of the bright spots. It includes Plyometrics (jump training), astanga yoga and some kenpo karate, with a mix of all of these bundled together into Cardio X. Each of these is good, although the kenpo section swings far wide of the actual practice of Kenpo karate, and gets boring after a while. I personally prefer jogging, cycling or swimming to it. Plyo is great and easily the best program in this package, and yoga is marginally below that. The length of the yoga section is just over 90 minutes, however, and can be tedious.Additionally, there is a Stretch X program complete at least once a week. This is good for recovery and flexibility, but be warned - NEVER stretch cold. You risk injury by tearing cold muscles, and it's something not properly addressed.DIETThis is the essential part of the program. Like the weights component, it's a mixture of good and bad. It emphasises calorie counting and eating at a caloric deficit (eating fewer calories than you burn daily), as well as an emphasis on cleaner eating. This is the best part of the diet - eating at a caloric deficit is essential to fat loss, and it provides a platform for future dietary consideration. However, the program errs here in places, and again becomes the victim of marketability.First off the bat - fat calories are NOT turned into body fat. Carbohydrates and fats are both natural sources of energy. You gain fat by eating too many carbohydrates and/or fats, with your body storing the excess energy as fat. There are numerous benefits to fats, including consuming essential fatty acids; they're slow digesting, so you feel fuller for longer; they're a more efficient fuel source than most carbohydrates; and they help dampen cravings.Throughout this program, no more than 20% of dietary intake is fats. Whilst it's certainly not the worst approach, it keeps up the facade that fats are a bogey man. Personally, when I eat at a caloric deficit, my diet consists of 40% protein, 20% carbs and 40% fats.The other main component to the diet is changing with the phases of the weights plan. This, frankly, doesn't make much sense. The diet, keeping fats consistent, begins with a 50/30/20 protein/carbs/fats split, then a 40/40/20 split, and finally a 20/60/20 split. This poses several problems. First of all, the level of protein in the last phase is too low for building or maintaining muscle. Protein is used by the body in repairing and maintaining muscle; minimum recommendations on a program where you don't want to lose muscle are 1 gram of protein (4 calories) per pound of bodyweight. Minimum. This violates that rule.The second problem is the increase in carbs. Apart from my own personal disposition against eating too many carbs on a fat-loss diet, eating so many in the last phase doesn't make sense. The stated purpose is to give you the strength to build muscle; yet you can't build muscle without adequate protein, and eating at a caloric deficit means you won't have a sufficient amount of energy any way (by consuming less food, to be converted into energy or in the case of protein used for protein synthesis, than your body needs to function).Additionally, increased carbs means an increase of insulin released by your body; insulin being the hormone that regulates carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body. This causes a problem because digesting more carbs results in higher releases of insulin. Basically, eating more carbs results in an insulin spike, which will make you hungry.This is compounded by the lack of protein. Protein acts as a natural appetite suppressant, and it is essential in the bodily function of gluconeogenesis, which ultimately sends messages to your brain that you've satisfied your appetite.Another sticking point are the supplements. The recovery shake and protein bars are, quite frankly, not needed, and the same results can be achieved by eating the correct foods and taking a proper multi-vitamin. The recovery shake mix, protein bars and various other supplements recommended are manufactured and sold by Beach Body - the company behind P90X. Stopping short of drawing links, I think the implications are obvious. The alternatives to the shake and protein bars are not mentioned at all in the diet program; for anyone interested, the optimal post-workout meal consists of quick-release carbs and proteins. The protein bars can be simulated by eating foods containing a slow-digesting protein, such as cottage cheese, or a protein food mixed with fats (natural peanut butter or your yellow cheeses are best for this).What's more, whilst the dietary aspect of P90X should be praised for recommending healthy foods, it's further marred by the simplicity of the portioning. Listing portions of foods and listing them as solely portions of a certain calorie group, whilst simplistic, also leads to errors. Most foods rarely are composed of simply one entire macronutrient (tuna, for example, or wheat), but alot more have a some other macronutrients (to clarify, those are protein, carbs and fats), and just as many more have a blend of macronutrients. By lumping them all into groups of solely carbs, or solely protein, users of the program run the risk of having their macronutrients balance wildly incorrect. Furthermore, dietary fibre isn't considered; a big no-no for any fat loss diet.SUMMARYThis programs weights and diet sections are a mixed bag, and could be fixed relatively easy. The cardio section of the program is excellent and the saving grace, although it can be tedious; that's the nature of cardio, and indeed all fitness training, though. There's just enough in this program that's helpful that stops it from getting an abysmal rating; as stated at the beginning, however, there are better things out there.3/5"

138266,2,"I was so excited after reading all these reviews. A $22 great board. Well, the good thing about the board is just that, the board. It's made of good material and heals nicely. The metal is way to thick which encourages bounce backs, the color of the numbers are nearly unrecognizable. That's no big deal, I painted mine white. There was about 1/16 th inch gap between metal and board which ridiculous. It can't simply be re-anchored....because... It was all warped and so something was inevitable to be ""off"". I gently removed it and took a picture. If I had to do again, I would probably buy the same board. Obviously, I'm one of the unfortunate. Oh, mounting instructions would have helped. 3 nails a few screws and some bracket I had to figure out."

The fins, on the other hand...they bent from *swimming* and one of them broke completely in half. I was pretty disappointed with the fins. But, for $30, it was totally adequate for the week that we used it."

297448,1,"When reviewing fitness books, I look for books that tell the reader how to fully use their bodies. I really like Anderson's method for two reasons:1. She knows muscles. She knows how they work, she knows how to train them. In the book, the concept of using certain muscles to perform an exercise is clearly explained. This is a crucial part of muscle training.2. She had a good balance between aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise, and she has put them together in a good way.Anderson was a dancer, she also took Pilates (the right way) and I could see both of those influences in her method. Don't get scared away by that--even if you've never seen the inside of a ballet studio, you'd be just fine working her method! But there is a reason that it is said that dancers are the athletes of God: because they are. Combining cardio (aerobic exercise) with Pilates (conditioning) and dance (alternating engage-disengage exercise to increase stamina) is the perfect combination for weight loss and muscle toning.Now how to get there if you have never experienced any of that?Anderson breaks the book down into different sections. The exercise portion, where she fully explains every stretch, position, and movement, is well described for the absolute beginner. More athletic users or advanced athletes would benefit also, but they wouldn't have to read the descriptions of the movements in their entirety.The DVD is very good: It features Anderson working the exercises in the book enough time to hear the description, see all the details, and do it yourself.There is also a section in the book with some great meals. The first section is a very thorough introduction that I do not recommend skipping! You'll learn tons about your body! I was also amazed at how much research Anderson did to create this method.The only thing I don't like: The cardio routine has no verbiage. I expected some talking, either voiceover or real time, with some counting or some description of what you should be doing. However, it was just music and Anderson dancing. It would take me, who has been dancing for almost five years, two or three times doing the DVD to get the combinations. It would be a lot more difficult and confusing for someone who doesn't have practice taking what they see and converting it for themselves.The other thing I wanted to see more of was proper stretching techniques. I honestly have yet to find a book that explains how to properly stretch without injury (it is possible!). My recommendation to anyone who uses this awesome program: stretch well. Stretch correctly. Get a dancer or a sports doctor to give you advice if you need it.Recommendation: Ages 14+ for anyone serious. This program takes time, energy, and commitment. If you can't commit to about two hours of your day, it's not for you. If you use the program, make sure you follow instructions very carefully to avoid injury! doing exercises incorrectly is a very fast way to end up in the physical therapists office (I can tell you that from personal experience, though not experience from this book).This review is copyright Haley Mathiot 2010.

These socks are nice too, just not what I was expecting for a 18 dollar trekking sock. I have a couple pairs of trekking socks for long hikes, and these are about 1/2 as thick. I'm pretty sure they will last a while, but not much thicker than my everyday socks!"

51267,1,Bike serves it's purpose and allows for a decent work out. Some of the features I don't like is that you have to hit start every few minutes in manual mode to keep the count and mileage going. The print on the display which highlights the different programs is way too small.

268671,2,"It's somewhere to sit I guess if you're on level ground, the back support is better than a 3 legged stool, but I would recommend the camp type chair before buying this. It's noisy, awkward to carry and not very stable to sit in. I decided to keep it because return shipping would be as much as the chair, but I usually grab the 3 legged stool for my blind hunting instead of this."
299993,2,I only have a problem with the instructions for assembly. I am not sure If the assembly instructions were not included but what I was given was of little help. I am a mechanic so can follow instructions well but this was tough. All I was given was a full assembly instruction manual. It was very difficult to sort out and a few important things were missing. But the machine is good I just would never want to put it together again.
414751,1,"I got this mat because I needed a little more cushioning in yoga class. It was a great mat for that purpose. The trade off is that the mat is heavier and larger than typical.I'm giving it four rather than five stars because it really smells when delivered and I had to clean it and air it out for awhile before the smell went away. Many reviews have said this, and I found it to be true. It would be helpful if Hugger Mugger did an end processing step to remove this smell before shipping."
192041,0,"The stock I got from Ultimate Paintball is a RAP4 product. It is designed for the Tippmann A5 and does work like it is supposed to. As one reviewer said, it has a lot of play between the stock and post it extends on. Not a big deal to me, but you get what you pay for. I actually did end up buying the GTA stock from a local paintball shop and the quality of it is much better."
315540,1,"These pants have already paid for themselves in laundering/pressing bills. My nine-year-old boy is a junior black belt. He spends a lot of time in the dojo. He spends a lot of time on the floor of the dojo, and he gets pretty grimy, with dirt absolutely ground into the knees of his pants.I couldn't get them clean at home, so before each tournament, I would take his gi to the cleaners to be washed and pressed. And even they couldn't get all of the dirt out of the knees. Then, just as he was outgrowing his second gi, I found these. The price couldn't be any better, so I ordered a pair. He is 5 feet tall, leggy, and he weighs about 82 pounds, and they are just a tiny bit wide through the hips and legs, but otherwise, they fit great. They are size 2 and seem to be just about exactly the same size as the pants from his Bold Look uniform. They wash well and hold their size. And although they're showing the dirt of the dojo, my son's tournament gi still looks like new.I am very happy with this purchase. When my son either outgrows or wears out these pants, I am definitely buying more."
148660,0,"I needed to replace the backboard because the original plastic broke into pieces within the first year of buying it. We barely used it so I don't know why it broke. I attempted to get it replaced by Walmart and they wouldn't help. They said to contact Spalding so I did - never heard back. I ultimately gave up and ordered a replacement.The replacement backboard had all the right pieces but the screws that came with it would not fit into the holes that in the metal pieces. I ended up using different screws and got it to work but it was a lot of hassle. All in all, I've been fairly unimpressed with the quality of Spalding's products."

The idea is great but Hoppe's execution could be better.The pros: quick...washableinexpensivesmall package ""easy to store in range bag"".can be used as an emergency tourniquet in a pinch {ok that's a stretch but hey innovation is a necessity}Cons:easy to break pull cordsame model doesn't necessarily mean it will fit (223/5.56) ""perhaps quality control issue""easily jams in barrel.difficult if not impossible to clean chamber to muzzle in AR platform, meaning your dragging particulate in to your receiver.As I said I have used and still use the BS in 223/5.56 and 308/7.62 as well as 45 & 9. The snakes for handguns and non AR platforms work well and with little issue. The caveat is the AR platforms, if your running a match grade barrel in 223 id recommend that you not use this BS. The lack of tactile feedback could leave your rifling damaged or a BS stuck in your barrel. Not to say the BS would cause the damage directly but more likely a large piece of particulate etc.. getting stuck in the snake and being raked down the barrel. For your average sportsman or tacticool user a BoreSnake is not a bad investment. They are really good at cleaning out the gunk left in your barrel when shooting steal case ammo like Wolf or Tula.My biggest complaint is the breaking of the pull cord. I am a moderate shooter, approximately 300 rds a month on my 5.56's and 200-300 rds on my 308 so I might use a snake 2-3 times a month. They average about 7-8 cleanings before the cord breaks.I have read a lot of reviews where users swear by these, I would as well for a quick clean however over time they just don't last making the bang for your buck rather underwhelming. I do want to point out that I have used snake's on my 45's and 9mm well over 100 times, I have never had to replace either and I believe I have at least 100 more cleanings before I would even consider the need to replace.

Otherwise the ends stay curled up creating a safety hazard. I find myself either or leaving it unstrapped in the back of my car or using it upside down so that it will lie flat.I had an old foam mat that had elastic loop straps so that you could roll it in either direction.On a positive note, the mat itself is a Cadillac. It provides maximum padding for my knees when I do girly pushups. Maybe I'll cut off the nylon straps and sew on some elastic straps."

490578,0,"I havent had the hose connectivity problems that everyone else had. Maybe they turned too much water pressure on? All you need is a trickle from your faucet and the pressure built up will do the rest. Too much water pressure and of course the connector will blow off. Anyway, I spray it and my yard is bug free for like 4-5 days. Longer with no rain, maybe up to 2 weeks. But after that the mosquitos come back with a vengence so I have to be vigilant about application. I must first cover myself head to toe in bug spray, then try to apply this without getting bit, then hope it doesnt rain this week or else the next day my yard will be a mosquito haven again. When it doesnt work I would say there is a 90% reduction in mosquitos (I still wear bug spray and get bitten) but thats better than a bite every 5 minutes, which is what happens without any protection, even when i AM wearing bug spray.If you have a small enough yard like me, maybe 1/8th an acre, one bottle can provide 3 applications. But you still have to do it weekly, not the 8 weeks that the label promotes."
422430,2,"You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves and I am calling out AMAZON as well. This umbrella is ""NOT"" 48 inches and that is why I only gave two stars. I take issue with the fact that the company is misleading the customers and that Amazon allows it. The umbrella itself ""appears"" to be strong, sturdy and of good quality. However, the proof is in when it is tested under strong wind and rain. The handle is very nice. The umbrella is NOT worth what they asked for and most of that is based on the fact that it is NOT even close to 48 inches. To be fair to the company the umbrella is well constructed. I believe that businesses need to give accurate information about a product so that the consumer can make an informed decision."
219889,0,"Coleman stoves are functional and durable and a good buy when on sale. Combining a stove and grill is a good idea, but beware because this one comes with a nonstick teflon grill. I don't like any nonstick teflon cookware, but if careful, the optional griddle is okay until it starts to wear. But grills get too hot for teflon. I bought this anyway and purchased a Lodge iron grill to use instead. Nothing lasts longer than cast iron, and you can get one pre-seasoned. Once seasoned, iron works like nonstick without the danger. Both are heavy and only suitable for car camping. But the iron grill can also be used with a campfire or coals."

150022,0,"I bought this product along withInsanity: The Ultimate Cardio Workout and Fitness DVD Programafter I finished the classicP90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner. It's a nice change of pace, and the workouts are effective, so overall I'd say I'm content with the purchase. However, the purchase is marred by a few frustrations.First, the product placement is so shameless and repetitive it's almost comical, like an SNL sketch making fun of infomercials. I'm not talking about the mandatory ""don't forget your recovery drink!"" that appears once or twice in every P90X video. Tony hawks the Bowflex SelectTech dumbbells so pervasively it feels like this is an infomercial, which would bother me less if this were a free demo on YouTube, but becomes annoying very quickly when it's in a video set you paid $70 for. In one video, he plugs the product about half a dozen times - basically every time he reaches for the dumbbells. ""Grab your Bowflex SelectTech adjustable dumbbells! . . . Thank you, Bowflex! I sure love these SelectTech adjustable dumbbells. . . . Don't forget your Bowflex SelectTech adjustable dumbbells!"" These are already rushed DVDs, as they tried to pack each workout into a shorter package, and at times they're pretty short on explanation and tips. It would be nice to have that time spent on content instead of wasted repeatedly trying to get us to buy more stuff.Second, one of the great things about the original P90X is the variety of content. You had 6 strength training routines plus the Ab workout (sort of half a workout) and 5 cardio/stretch routines, plus a lovely Nutrition Book and Fitness Guide packed with information and exercise descriptions. This box is more like something out of a bargain bin. Gone are the info-packed books; it just includes a little pamphlet with more product placement, a short exercise program suggestion, and instructions to go to the website to get workout sheets. Beyond that, it costs about half what P90X does, but contains less than half the content: 2 new strength training routines plus a new Ab workout and 2 new cardio routines. So you spend half the money you did for the first program, but you get 4.5 routines with bare-bones informational material instead of 11.5 routines with two material-packed books.Despite the above, as I wrote at the outset, overall I'm content with the program, mostly because I like the new Kenpo workout, the Upper Body Plus workout is great, and I enjoyed the new Ab workout. I just wish I could give the product a whole-hearted 4 or 5 stars like Insanity and P90X instead of a hesitant 3."
476389,1,"Purchased this tire on sale for 15 bucks. At this price, the value can not be beat. Shipping from this seller was super fast too. Mounted the tire right away and went for a 18 mile ride on dry Texas trails. The grip at excellent but it felt a bit loose probably due to the tall tread. Once I got used to how the tire felt and handled, I found myself pushing the bike harder in corners than I ever had before. The tire throw a lot of dirt too. I might be purchasing a second set soon."

304873,0,"The watch seems to be ruggedly constructed and well made. I had no issues with the crown or A and B buttons, as mentioned in a couple other reviews. They are just the standard screw lock type. You have to make sure you have them unscrewed enough to move the buttons in and out far enough to activate, or you will be pushing a slightly moving button with no effect, but they're pretty standard.Unfortunately, compared to other slide rule watches, everything about the unit as a whole is a bit small. First off, the claim of a ""Standard Length"" band is somewhat questionable as I have never had a problem with any Casio, Timex, etc. I did have a slight problem with a Bulova once, but it was revealed that somone had ""borrowed"" a couple links for another watch. The SNA411, however, (with all supplied links) simply will not fit on my ""Standard Circumference"" wrist. It needs at least two extra links. If your wrist is larger than 8.5"" in circumference, plan on the extra $30 and two days of buying extra links and having them installed. Next is the Slide Rule. Bozhe moy!*Reviewer Pounds head on Desk*The outer scale is fine, no problems there. On the inner scale, the time indicators (1:10, 1:20) and so on are adequate, but the calculation indicators that are supposed to be above them proved impossible to read with my nephew's 20/20 vision checked last month. My 40 year old eyes? Not a chance. I really shouldn't have to carry around a magnifying glass to read this. I would estimate that the height of the letters is literally less than half the thickness of a dime. There is plenty of open black space around the numbers, so there seems to be absolutely no real reason to make the lettering this small. The nice clear - high contrast- picture shown on Amazon does not appear to have such a problem. In person, however, outside the photo studio lighting, the real item does. The idea of reading this while aloft in a Cessna 172 is... well, not really a joke - It's just not going to happen! The Tachymeter scale, including associated tick marks also suffers from the same issue, rendering it quite useless. The jeweler I took it to to have more links installed showed me a variety of similar watches, none of which I had any problem reading. But... I didn't buy it from the jeweler... *NOTE* I can take a picture of the slide rule in macro mode on my Android, and blow it up about double and read it, but, I have an E6-B app on my phone anyway so.... So, in short, when buying one of these, make sure you see it in person first."

288877,0,"I think I really meant to get the one with the built in gauge, but that was my mistake. First thing I have to say is that this really is not a suitable substitute for a floor pump. The foot feels flimsy and the hose is just barely long enough to reach the valve on my bike. However, once it was connected it was easy to pump and I got the tires up to the right pressure pretty quickly. The pump looks good and fits nicely on the frame of a road bike."
299508,0,"The price was considerably less than a sled made for sledding, so it's my fault for being cheap. In my defense, logic would suggest if you can hall a few hundred pounds of dead weight it should be more than sturdy enough to tow my children around the yard. All things considered I'm happy with the purchase though I have not had an opportunity to use it. On a negative note for the ""hunter"" in shipping it was dented and would imagine if you where under load dragging over branches and rocks I couldn't see this lasting very long."
204788,0,"I only use it as a back-up to when I can't go for a walk outside. For that purpose, it's good enough. It doesn't take up space and is easy to use. It is squeaky like some other users mentioned, but it doesn't bother me too much as I had tv or music on loud enough to cover it up. The only thing is that it doesn't have varying resistance, so if you don't weigh much, it's quite a bit of effort to step on it. I weigh about 92 and it's hard to get it going. For my husband who weighs 145, it's much easier."
204052,0,"I bought the Swagman xc cross country 2-bike rack. I really liked the price and it showed up right before I was to go on my camping trip with the wife. When it arrived the pagaging was a little messed up but sometimes that's normal. I put the rack together but when doing so some of the parts weren't well finished ( one of the lock down knobs had plastic inside where the threads were making it unable to screw into the bolt. Also when I was researching this product I saw a video on how easy it was to work with the ratcheting hooks to hold down the bikes to the rack. In the video it looked very easy but in reality, once you've pushed down the ratcheting hooks to hold the bikes firmly in place, it is almost impossible to loosen the ratchets by hand. I had to use a hammer to loosen the ratchets enough to finally get them off by hand. They are very tight which is good but, also very hard to remove. Therefore the not so good rating here. I'm thinking in trying a different model and returning or selling my current one."

My mistake and I almost crashed when the front fork started coming loose.Overall, you really can't beat it for the money.

39259,2,"I was excited to receive these, but within 6 months they were not working well. They do not always pick up all the weights that I adjust them for and occasionally some of the weights slip out after I pick them up. These have been a complete disappointment. I understand, from a personal trainer friend, that the only benefit of these is the brand name - there are a couple of non-Bowflex products that are very similar, cost less and perform better. My discussions with Bowflex for customer service have been completely unproductive. If I could rate these as a zero, I would happily do so."

Another thing. I wear a size 10 1/2 but these large were flopping around so had to wear neoprene dive socks. Smaller size, too tight."
159270,1,"I searched to find a knife that had all the features I believed my son would need in a boyscout knife. At the same time I didn't think he was ready to be responsible for a $78 Leatherman Wave like I prefer. The Victorinox Farmer model was a good compromise between function and value. The main blade is wider and thicker than a standard model and comes super sharp right out of the box. The other tools are also beefed up and I believe will stand up to years of hard use. My main reason for choosing the Farmer model was the addition of the saw blade. I compared it to the one on the Wave and found it to be just as long as the one on the Wave, but slightly thinner. It should prove just as functional. The silver alox handle should be easy to locate if dropped outdoors and is distinct from other knives. A lanyard attached to the keyring should keep it from falling out of a pocket. Not listed in the product description is a small rectangular flat space on the reverse side of the handle suitable for engraving my son's initials. If you are looking for a rugged, functional knife that will work for scouting, camping, backpacking, or EDC, it's hard to match the value of the Victorinox Farmer model."
70982,2,"This looks like a very sturdy scooter but I have to give it a low ranking as we've been unable to get a response from customer service and now have to return the scooter to Amazon.I ordered the scooter for my 9 year old for Christmas. This was his ""big"" gift. As one of the other reviewers commented, unlike other items I've ordered from Amazon that come in a very discrete brown box, this box has a huge picture of the scooter on it. Luckily it was delivered while my son was at school and I was able to hide it from him.Unfortunately, the stem/handlebars did not come pre-assembled as indicated in the instructions and as a result, we had to try to figure out how to install the hand brakes. I searched the Kent website for instructions, called and left messages with customer service twice and sent them two emails asking for help but never received a response. I'm returning the scooter today and we'll order a scooter from a different company.I will say, it looks like a very sturdy scooter and someone with a little more experience might be able to figure out how to install the hand brakes. I wasn't going to risk it."

When I check my 2 TU-80 tuners against a high-end one, I find that the Accu-Pitch beep can sound as much as 5 cents out of tune, which is bad enough so that I have to retune.As far as the metronome goes, as other reviewers have noted, it's just not loud enough to be anything but a toy. Too bad, too - there was an opportunity to send the metronome signal out of the output jack, so that it could have driven an earphone, or could have been fed into a mixer, which was a choice that Boss itself made in its much-superior DB-12 metronome, but absent that feature, this metronome can't be used as an aid for practicing any real-world instrument."

265939,1,"This sight does not project a laser dot nor is it a magnifying scope. However, what it does do is good for targets you can see clearly with the naked eye, but can't seem to get a consistent hit. How it works is simple: you look through a crosshair etched on a non-magnifying glass. Place your target in the crosshair and align the laser dot on the center of the crosshair. Now you see the target, crosshair and laser dot. Squeeze off a shot.If you are varmint shooting this system is good because the critter doesn't see the laser. Also, if you are target shooting on a bright sunny day, the laser doesn't get washed out by the sun.Although I hated this thing when I first got it, I now appreciate the simplicity and ease of use. Zeroing was a cinch. I tried a laser projected dot type sight on an air pistol and decided this was better.Caution: You need a rail type mounting system to mount this thing."

323845,1,"I used to do a lot of aggressive skating, but aggro skates aren't the best for getting around the college campus quickly and in comfort. These skates were a great solution. Putting them on is quick and easy, and then I can zip from class to class. They also work great for recreational skating with girls or in groups, or just to get a good workout.The soft boot is very comfortable, offering support but more flexibility than a hard boot skate, which will allow more advanced skaters more freedom of motion. Even beginners will enjoy the liberating comfort of the soft boot.The wheels are a good compromise between speed and maneuverability. The aluminum frames are very sturdy and rigid, allowing for great control. The speed lacing system makes life a lot easier, all you need to do to tighten the laces is pull on the little handle, then tuck the extra slack into a little pocket in the tongue where velcro keeps it safe so you won't be tripping over your laces. Then the velcro middle strap and the ratcheting top strap quickly adjust for the right amount of ankle support.All in all, this seems like the ideal skate for anyone from beginners up to advanced skaters. It's not a racing skate, and it's not an aggressive skate for launching off ramps or grinding or the like, but for anything in between (which is probably what most skaters will be doing) it is perfect."

For example, the dunks. where did they go? It's like everyone's hands are still hurting from 2003's dunks. Get real. Secondly, what's with the unrealistic statistics. I played one game against the knicks......... why is Howard Eisley scoring 30+ at all. This guy is damn near 40 years old. Get real. And last but not least, a topic that i think has plagued Live fanatics, and all other basketball gamers around the world for the longest. Where the hell did the three-point and dunk contest go? Ok, we got the one on one, which is great, but I mean these are just two of the BIGGEST EVENTS IN THE ALL STAR WEEKEND. Is it the disc compatability or are we just not caring anymore.

9122,2,"This is my third polar watch. I'm back from the old days when they were made in Finland.Bought this watch as a replacement for my old S210 (http://www.amazon.com/Polar-S210-Heart-Monitor-Watch/dp/B00075MGP0).The BAD:1. Watch is totally plastic. Of course, I'm aware it is not scratch-resistance, but comparing to my old S210, quality went way down.2. Watch has poor sensor reception; several times even the thread mill manages to receive the heart rate information better and it is not an interference problem, since I am far for other runners and no other environment problems I can notice.3. Three-line display poor customization; for instance I cannot set Total Time + lap time + heart rate. It is tied to these pre-defined sets one has to choose from.4. ""Please wait"" message - come on, Polar; this is not a smart phone!!! Whenever you finish an exercise session, you have to deal with an up-to-10-seconds message.5. Overall software: they picked something that used to work and tried to make it more user friendly to reach a broader audience - now menus are more complicated, navigation is deeper and more confusing.The GOOD:Only spent $140; I was about to by a RS800 and with these quality issues I would be so mad. Next time, will try a Suunto - just waiting for my watch to die in order to be a former Polar customer."

156254,0,"I had been using a plain fit ball for my ""desk chair"" for several years when it recently bit the dust. I thought this chair might be an improvement since it would enable me to turn and roll to the part of my desk behind me rather than getting up and down so much. I also thought having a back might be nice.I still think many people might prefer this chair to a plain ball, but I do not. I found it did not roll smoothly and involved a lot of pushing and pulling to get where I wanted to go. I also found the chair leg placement uncomfortable for me since I like to tuck my legs under me. I discovered I actually like being able to roll around on the ball to loosen up my spine -- tucking and untucking my pelvis, doing ""belly dance"" rotations while I work, etc. And getting up and down a lot is not a bad thing for burning calories and keeping the blood flowing.I think the chair is well-designed, attractive, and easy to put together. But I'm going to return it and go back to a plain ball."

53433,2,"The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these ""packaging engineers"" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and the hard packaging almost broke them!But I was thrilled. A handsome object, thought I, and I loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open. So much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband. I yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed. But, alas, it would not follow instructions as they were written. ""Press and hold the Set button. Hour display blinking."" (Could they not have said, ""The hour display will blink""? I pressed. ""Press Memory button to adjust the hour."" I did. The Memory button never did a thing. So I asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either. We both tried several combinations of maneuvers, but nothing worked. To this moment, the hour display is blinking, blinking, blinking.I'd like to get my money back, but ya know what? J & R Music & Computer World in NY demand such a rigamarole to send it back, including with all the original packaging (I threw the OP in the trash), that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions, which, of course, are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves. Now I'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash, while I will make sure I never order from J&R; again."
140696,0,"I am a heavier individual and have been wanting to find a fun way to exercise, as I've never been a major fan of any type of exercise. So, I bought this game as it has received many wonderful reviews. Unfortunately I was very disappointed and ended up returning it to the store I purchased it from, which thankfully they let me do that! First of all, the band that is supposed to go around your thigh did not fit mine, so I had to put it just above my knee. I think it still worked ok, but it just wasn't comfortable and wanted to slide down. Secondly, I have bad ankles and knees and the exercises were not meant for beginners at all, with the squats causing me pain. I think this would be a great game for anyone who is already in shape and wants to add variety to their pre-existing exercise program, but it was just not for me. Eventually it might be once I get in better shape, but if you're a beginner, I recommend the Wii Fit over Wii Active, as there are more progressive exercises on the Wii Fit than on the Wii Active....just be careful of the Wii Fit's weight limit. It's worth it to pay more money to get the Wii Fit than the Wii Active game if you're a beginner, in my opinion."

353366,0,"Originally bought this to use on one of my tactical rifles. Although the strap material seems strong enough, it also does feel somewhat thin and finished with rough cut edges that reinforce the feeling that this is at best an average quality product. Doesn't really inspire much confidence if I were to use it with one of my more expensive rifles. The accessory straps that come with the set are hindered with an even cheaper feeling sensation than the main sling; their hooks and buckle hardware are plastic with a definite low-end feel to them that I wouldn't even consider suitable for the cheapest fanny pack, let alone a $2000 rifle. I suppose you get what you pay for, and this sling does fit that description to a tee. Usable, but definitely worth looking for a better solution, particularly for any heavier rifle. For me, I've since gone to a Wilderness Tactical sling; only a bit more expensive...but at the same time it feels significantly better suited for the job as well. Haven't regretted the changeover. This one on the other hand is probably better used on a lightweight rig, like an airsoft or paintball setup."

255551,1,"I do Bikram yoga 5 or 6 days a week and I use this towel each time. I have the ""springburst"" pattern, which is pink tie-dye. The colors have not faded much despite the fact that I wash the towel almost every day. The silicon numbs on the bottom are great so that the towel sticks to the yoga mat. I prefer using a mat and towel as opposed to the Breathe yoga mat as I have noticed that those become ruched around the edges. This towel lays completely flat and is thin enough that it doesnt bunch under your feet during yoga. Also for those of us with OCD, the fact that it is perfectly sized for a yoga mat is quite pleasing. I plan on ordering another one in the near future, even though they are kind of expensive. I have only had the towel for two months, so my only concern at this point is how well it will hold up to repeated use in the long term."

I got the size 0 and although it is a little long in the sleeves and inseam, all I did was roll up the sleeves and hemmed the pants. Even though the uniform is a little roomier on her, I think the 00 would be a tad too restricting for the moves she'd have to do and she'd outgrow it too quickly. All in all, I definitely recommend this karate uniform."

I contacted the manufacturer and they said they haven't heard too many complaints about that...I must just be ""sensitive"". So, I tried washing again and mixing some powdered drinks directly in the bottle. The metallic taste is now gone if I pour the water into a cup, but the smell is still there when drinking from the bottle. I've also purchased a couple of the bottles with the sports caps. I don't notice the metallic smell or taste with those, so it may just be something with my cap."

371126,0,"The quality is what I expected after reading about some of the issues other buyers have experienced, yet they met the need of what I was looking for so that my 2-yr old could join in the fun with her own skates. The wide base provides her enough stability that she's not falling over. The strap buckles are difficult to the point that after only a few uses the metal piece within the buckle fell off. I think we are going to go with somebody else's recommendation and replace the straps with velcro for speed and ease in putting on. Wish the manufacturer would do that from the start. The screw on the bottom for adjusting to length is holding so far (we don't need to continually retighten). Would I buy them again? Absolutely! They are worth the hassles just so my 2-yr old can come out on the ice with her very own skates."

8759,2,"After reading through a bunch of reviews I saw one stating that the included screws do not match the holes they are supposed to fit into requiring rethreading of the holes. I didn't want to believe this but when I assembled mine I discovered that this was definitely the case. I threaded the screws in anyhow figuring I probably wouldn't take it back apart again. The only screw that actually fit was the one that holds the whole unit in the end of the handle bar which is nice so I can remove it if I want to. The overall quality is mediocre at best and I would recommend buying something perhaps made out of metal. The plastic parts feel cheap and would probably brake quite easily if your bike were to fall over for whatever reason. Mine did not have a convex lens so I can't speak to whether it actually makes a difference or not. Just know that if you buy this product, you'll get what you pay for, if not something less than what you pay for. The price felt right at the time but knowing what I know now I'd spend a little more on a nicer piece of equipment. If you just want something cheap that'll get the job done then this will probably suffice, just be prepared to deal with the screw problem by either replacing them with proper screws or straining a little extra when screwing them in."

If I had to do it again I would have saved up a little more money and bought the big one.

406415,1,"We looked many places, including the big chain stores, since we had seen this particular cooler being sold at retail before. I had a very old Igloo Legend 12 in green color, on which the lid would no longer snap shut. It also seemed that the various 8-12 can coolers were a bit too small for food and drinks for two people for a full day out on the lake, so we wanted something smaller than a 16, but larger than a 10 or 12. The lid on this cooler snaps shut with a deep seated ridge and keeps everything ice cold for more than 24 hours. We use a combination of the six can blue ice packs and regular ice cubes from our fridge, and are very pleased with the ability to keep ice and retain cold temps. The square size is also very nice and it fits extremely well in the cockpit of our boat, within easy reach, yet not in the way. Can't say the accessory compartment on top makes a bunch of sense, but I guess I will use it for car keys or frequently used lures. The handle is very sturdy and folds down. I am confident we will get a lot of good service from this cooler, and we recommend it highly! Amazon did an excellent job of packing it and shipping it quickly, and the price was more than fair!"

203866,1,"Swagman XC Cross Country 2 bike hitch mount rack for 2 inch receiver is study, steady and secure for two heavy bikes. Secure easy load and unload; ZERO bounce on the highway! Takes about 10 minutes to set up first time, then less than 20 seconds to load and secure each bike and even less to unload. Folds up, stores easy. The tapered hitch pin is key to the no-wobble, no bounce fit but requires a wrench to install and remove rack from vehicle. The pin also has an exposed hole for retainer clip but you could easily use a lock instead. Good value and more stable than anything else I've seen on the road."
110867,1,"I bought this shirt because I was participating in a ""Making Strides Against Breast Cancer"" walk a few weeks ago. I ordered an XL, but it fit me more like a medium or large. It was tight. I think the size runs a little small.However, the quality of the shirt is very nice. The price is reasonable as well. It was delivered very promptly. Just remember that the sizes run SMALL. I ordered the largest they had, but I poured myself into it! LOL. (and XL is my normal size)."

110863,0,"Like a few reviewers have noted, there is a terrible plastic/vinyl smell and taste to the mouthpiece. I've aired and soaked the mouthpiece in baking-soda/water overnight and the smell and taste it leaves is still bad. I would think twice before buying this particular item again. Hopefully with time this will disipate. I've removed the mouthpiece and used it without for now, still works ok, and time will tell if it increases lung capacity/function. The deep breathing exercises have seemed to help a little so far."
370293,1,"This knife is built like a tank. It's heavy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's a lot of metal behind the cutting edge, which makes it easy to use as a chopper. The blade is tough and it keeps its edge for a very long time. The serrations are great, not too agressive so it glides through material, but jagged enough to saw though it. The serration teeth are rounded so you don't have to worry about chipping or denting delicate tips.The leather sheath is basic but very functional. The leather stretches when inserting the knife. This firmly secures the knife even without using the leather snap (although I strongly recommend using it) but I feel it may reduce the life of the sheath.Unfortunately, when I bought this knife, I meant to buy the straight edge version not the serrated version. Nothing against the knife, I just prefer a straight edge. I sold it and bought the straight edge version. Whatever version you get, you won't be disappointed.Now, that's not to say this knife doesn't have any flaws. There is no such thing as a perfect metal for a knife. The blade is carbon steel and it will rust if kept in very humid conditions. The black coating on it helps prevent rust, but that will eventually wear off. Keep this knife dry, clean it after using it. Leather will also be negatively affected by humidity so keep that in mind.None of these flaws prevent the knife from lasting a lifetime and more."

393111,0,"This game is awsome with mini games. They made new fields with snow, rain, sand, trash cans, etc. Game Breakers (certian number of style points that give you good moves) arn't as powerful as before. Also this has great graphics and sounds. Even though this may sound similar to the other two they arn't.Lets get to the negitive part. Respect the Street mode is like the season. In this instead of playing one type of game(points,bank [which has to deal with style points] defence scoring, etc) you have to play a mixture of all. This bothers me a little and if you just want to play a regular game with points you have to play up to 68.Don't get me wrong though, this is a good game and is worth buying and if you are a football fan or someone who just likes to hang out on their PS2 this is worth buying."

These gloves to cover and protect my hands, but don't feel like a second skin as you would hope. I mean, I don't want to feel the glove, I want to feel like I'm gripping the [insert shaft here] without anything between it, while still utilizing the protective nature of a glove.Having never wore a glove made from human skin, I can't say how exactly the sensation would feel, but I can tell you how it would NOT feel, and this glove is it. Pff, so much cushion and padding it's like it's made from an 80s female jacket's shoulder pads shaped like hands.Working out is supposed to be grueling and painful. No pain, no gain, sir. It's not supposed to be cupcakes and rainbows, all cushy and soft. This isn't nap-time, people, it's time to feel the burn. If you want to feel the burn, light these gloves on fire before you start your workout. Otherwise, look elsewhere, there are some gloves on here made of chainmail and chili powder, go for those."
466830,2,"Assembly was a problem. Parts did not allign well and after a few uses the hoop came loose that holds the bag. I could not get it to stay after that and resorted to good old duct tape to hold it on. But it was only 14.95. I think the charge for shipping was almost as much. So it is a pretty cheap one. Maybe one of the other models works better. These thing are pretty cool, when they stay together."

504064,2,"The headphones that come with this product are non-adjustable. They curve over your ears and meet behind the head. I am only 5'1"" and the band of the headphones bang into the base of my neck and are very uncomfortable. Unfortunately the headphones are hardwired into the bottom of the unit, and so they can't be replaced with ones that fit better. The manufacturer says ""sorry, that's all we have."" Considering that this is their top-of-the line product, I am very unimpressed.If you are under 5'4"" don't buy this!The MP3 player itself seems to work fine, although sometimes it doesn't shut off immediately."
408980,1,"I purchased this stand to use with my SelectTech 1090 dumbbells, and it is a perfect complement to the dumbbells.Assembly of the stand is simple and straightforward [despite other reviews], and can be done relatively quickly (there are only 9 separate components to it). The only tool you'll need to assemble the stand (that isn't included with it) is a 9/16-inch wrench or socket.The stand comes with a set of rubber feet to hold it firmly in place, but it also comes with a set of castors that you can use instead, if you feel you'll need to roll it from one spot to another.Once it's assembled, it is solid and firm, even with two 90-pound dumbbells sitting in their racks on it. It holds the dumbbells at a comfortable height, and is much better than bending all the way down to the floor.It does come with a 30-year warranty, but since there are really no moving parts or anything to wear out, I expect that it will probably last longer than that."
381196,1,"This pedometer is the best I have found and keeps a very accurate record of the daily steps you take.

300914,1,"First of all, I was impressed with delivery to front door at not cost.I weigh about 160lbs and the eliptical seems very sturdy and of solid robust build. My wife, two daughters and myself have been using it very regularly for about a year now and see no problems. Very smooth motion and great range of resistance for work out.I spent alot of time researching elipticals and visited several sporting good stores to test drive the many different make and models and found that this schwinn eliptical was the most smooth and solid construction in its price range and was better than some that were priced at $1000.00 and up.The control panel or operator panel may not have the best or most elaborate features and I was a little dissappointed that it does not keep track or a record of combined mileage or total mileage. That is the only thing I can complain about.It's been worth the money and then some."
218491,1,"I just reviewed Championship Hold'em a few moments ago and relayed there the way in which that book specifically helped me earlier in the week when I played in a couple of live tournaments out in Vegas. Now this book, independent of the other, was quite useful when I sat at the 1-2 No Limit game at the MGM Grand and also when I played the 2-4 at the Tropicana in their Poker Room.Previous to reading these two books by Cloutier and McEvoy, I had finished three by Sklansky. I found that by following Sklansky's Small Stakes Hold'em I was playing far too conservatively to win. The blinds were eating me up and I rarely got any good cards to enter pots with. The opinions of Cloutier and McEvoy are far more practiceable I believe.What we have here is a weed's eye view of what one should do when playing pot limit and no limit hold'em. There is some overlap with the other book but both are valuable on their own. The authors conclude that pot limit requires more skill than limit but that no limit requires the most skill of all.While I was in Vegas, outside of the Rio where the World Series of Poker was being held, I did not see any mention of pot limit games but I've been in them a couple times online and have to state that it's one a most exciting variety of poker. It can get crazy fast and the book is quite insightful in describing the way in which one should specifically play.The reader is given crystal clear advice on what to do in particular situations and the two authors seem to cover every single contingency that should arise. I was helped by the plain language and non-condescening prose of these two champions. I also liked the practice hands that were included. ""Doing"" definitely enhances learning and I found that to be the case here."
364145,2,"Love the way this boot looks, but the calf part of the boot is super wide and the fit wasn't good at all. Too much room in the calf area. Don't recommend ordering cowboy boots online. You need to go to a store and try them on.I sent them back."
460301,0,"These are nicely styled compared to what is available as hiking shorts in any local stores. My only complaint is the use of velcro to hold the pockets closed.

271538,1,"I have Snap Caps for a variety of calibers. While most modern guns claim dry firing is safe, Snap Caps just give you peace of mind. They are a bit pricey but they last a while. The edges do get knicked after a few uses, but the Snap Caps don't lose any functionality. Snap Caps are also useful when developing trigger control (randomly throw a few in a mag of live rounds while at the range and see if you flinch) as well as for failure to fire drills.Four stars only because these seems a bit overpriced for what they are. It may not seem so, but after you've bought a set in a bunch of calibers it really adds up."
160781,1,"I've had the Invicta Mens 8926 Pro Diver Automatic for 3 weeks now & I thouroughly enjoy it. It is a great watch for the approximately $80 that I paid. It is sturdy, attractive, & built very tough. I am hard on watches but 2 things bother me about most watches more than anything else. I have large wrists & most watch bands do not even come close to fitting comfortably. The band on this watch had to be adjusted down 2 pegs. My second problem with most watches is that the battery always runs out at the most inconvenient times. This being an Automatic watch, I don't even have to wind & batteries are a thing of the past.. All-in-all, I think I made a great & valued purchase."

122869,1,"This is a very good quality bench with plenty of comfortable support. The quality is very good - excellent, especially for the price. I am over 200 lbs, and this bench is plenty comfortable. I squish the foam about half way, no where near close to bottoming out.The set up was very fast. I had it out of the box and sat on it in less than 60 seconds. Then I readjusted the height in another 10 seconds.The pins that fit in the seat are spring loaded, very smooth operating and easily slide into the holes in the seat rails.The bench adjusts to 4 heights, and I started on second from the lowest and moved it up a notch.I was not sure what this bench would be like based on some of the negative reviews about quality and difficulty to adjust the seat. Perhaps they made improvements, because this bench is much better and easier to set up than some of the comments indicate.You can't go wrong buying this bench."
114261,0,This headlight represents great value for money - the light beam is strong and the battery life is excellent.The band that secures the light is easy to fit but when I tried to move the light to another bike the locking system failed.It's essentially a disposable lamp - use it 'till it dies then buy another. Don't plan on switching it between bikes and you'll be fine.

342268,0,"I like this watch. They also have a black face version with gold colored hands which is similar except that it replaces the numbers with just dashes to represent it. I prefer numbers and the white face of this version because it's much easier to see and the illumination is also brighter when in a dark room. However, the biggest complain on this watch is the strap. The design makes it uncomfortable. The undulations on the strap digs on the side of your wrist so if you wear it tight it's quite uncofrtable. You have to wear it loose around your wrist but then to some people that's also not comfortable because the undulations holds the watch in place but the actual strap is really just floating around your wrist. I suggest you buy a different strap (which probably would cost you an extra $10) for a better fit. That was disappointing.Also, the other design faux pas of this watch is the buttons around the face. People wear their watch on their left arm, so naturally they have to use their right hand to push the buttons. There are 3 buttons and 2 are located on the left and one is on the bottom right. The upper right button is fake and just for decoration. The placement of these buttons makes me go ....huh?! Did their industrial designers go to design school at all? Most common button to use 1st is the upper right for your forefinger and 2nd the bottom left for your thumb. Instead Casio made use of the upper left which is the hardest to reach! And if they are going to put the Indiglo button on the right, it should be the upper right instead of the bottom right. They should take a queue from Timex."
286427,2,"I purchased two pair of these glasses back in January. I travel about 80% of the time so they have not been used too much. Yesterday I went to play a game of racquetball and the glasses fell apart on me. I have no idea why, took them out of locker and a split from the top of the nosepiece straight up to the frame. Not fixable. I looked at the second pair I purchased at the same time, and the same thing is happening to that item too.I have probably worn these less than 90 minutes each, so certainly not worth the money."
126685,1,"I'm a novice. but one thing for sure..my original bike seat hurt. I tried everything that I could not to break bread to buy a new seat but, alas i purchased this one.

462561,2,I bought these for my mother who is 86 and has partial hearing loss typical of seniors her age. She had previously gone to a hearing specialist who recommended expensive hearing aids. Before we went that route she wanted to give these inexpensive hearing amplifiers a chance. We tested this product by reading lists of 25 different words. I read 5 lists with the product in her ear and 5 lists without it. The surprising result was that she asked me to repeat words not understood more than twice as often with the product then without. This product is not worth your time or money.
324424,0,"After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to get my 8 year old daughter a Ripstik instead of a regular skateboard for her birthday. Big mistake. She is a pretty agile kid and is really good on both her bike and scooter, but this thing is really tough for her. I can barely stand on it for a few seconds without falling over, and I'm in great shape! She has tried and tried, but cannot seem to get the hang of it so I am going to put this baby away for a few years and buy her a junior skateboard instead. I think the Ripstik age range is a little off and maybe more appropriate for older kids and adults."

268874,0,"The quality of the build of the bike is good--better than my last one anyway. Assembly of the bike is however, horrible. The front wheel, with it's linear break was hard to tune, and the break still scrapes on the the break disk. The quick release was missing from the packaging entirely, and I had to go out and buy a new one. The gears took me about 2 hours to figure out, and tune so that there's no scraping on the spikes/leads. Also, don't rely on the instruction booklet, as that is applied to a general variety of bikes, and there are almost no instructions related to this bike. However, once the assembly is done, you have yourself a very god entry level bike."

After unpacking found plenty of scratches and a couple of bent parts but didn't want to hassle returning it. Fortunately no parts were missing. The assembly instructions are worthless but I managed to figure it out. It took about 2 hours to assemble. One tire would not hold air so I had to take it to a bike shop and have it repaired. In the end it is a nice bike, I just wish it wasn't all beat up."

7327,1,"I was looking for a new range case and one that would hold my M&P 15-22 in storage when it's not in use. I wanted to avoid a foam lined case because of the moisture issues and this case was a perfect solution. It not only holds my 15-22 with MBUS sights and reflex sight but also a box of 500 rds of 22, 4 mags, several boxes of 380and 40 S&W, and 2 soft pistol cases on either side of the 15-22 plus my ears, a scope and glasses. There is plenty of room if you pack it right. I keep the 15-22 in a gun sock to protect it from moisture and bumps. It's a pretty secure case with spots for 2 pad locks but I would like another on the hinge side so I'm sure I will poke 2 holes for a cable lock there. I only own 3 guns so I don't need a full locker cabinet. All in all I'm really happy with it."

415476,0,"This driver definitely will boom out the big drives you'd expect from a 460cc head. For the price, that's a miracle. But - don't fool yourself into thinking this is high-quality gear. The paintwork is cheap, the head is a generic design that shows up in other mfrs' clubs (albeit at a higher price) and its overall feel doesn't lend one to believe it'll hold up more than a couple seasons. Most crucially, though, I've taken mine out a fair amount in the last six weeks and it already shows clear signs of stress fracturing and surface cracking on the face, right around the sweet spot. I hit a consistent 270-280 yard drive with the club - for now. But I don't hold much hope it's a club that'll live long if used often."

Smaller kids will enjoy this gun, if you're willing to let them play with it, but this gun is pretty disappointing compared to a regular paintball gun or most other airsoft guns.While I wouldn't try running around with it like you would in a match, it's alright for indoor target shooting. It shoots somewhat hard, but the hopup sends the bbs flying almost straight up after ~75', and you can't adjust it. The barrel wobbles, and the bolt feels like it will snap off if you try to cycle it too fast."

For $12.00 you would think you would get a better product considering that in Sam's Club, you can buy the shirts for $7.00. The shirts I received are useless and will be religated to be used as rags. You would not use them when you are painting becaue the paint would come right through the fabric. Do not under any circumstance buy these shirts ."

They could knock $20 more off the price & sell it without a computer. It is easy to use, and very stable considering how light it is! It's a fun machine, I just don't feel like I'm getting a very good workout since there's no resistance. For the price, which was around $75 at Christmas, it's a good product. If you're looking for an elliptical, this isn't what you want."

501436,1,"Did a lot of research on exercise bikes and settled on this one. Glad I did. To me the best way to compare a stationary bike workout is to do so against how it feels against a non-stationary bike workout. So far, so good. Setup was not complicated. You need the allen wrench provided but the other tool I never used. Most everyone has a phillips screwdriver laying around. That being said, it took all of about 45 minutes to put together. I've used it 3 times so far and it gives me as good a workout as a non-stationary bike. The digial module takes a little getting used to, but reading the directions a few times resolved that. Overall, I consider this money well spent."

252524,0,"I bought this bag for winter camping in the Colorado Mountains. I used it the first weekend I bought it and the temps got down to 22 degrees. I did not stay a second night because I was too cold. This bag is awesome quality, the finish is great, the zippers are great, and I love the colors. The sad reality is, I followed the add 15 degrees rule thinking I could camp down to 15 degrees, and it still wasn't enough bag. I was sleeping in a Carhartt long sleeve tee shirt and jeans inside the bag as well, which I feel you should not have to do to stay warm. I was on an army style cot, the cold came in through the bottom so I put a wool blanket underneath me, that helped a lot. my core temp would still not stay warm enough to keep my extremities warm, so my feet froze. I was not shivering, but not comfortable either. Great bag for 32 and up. Gave three stars for quality. I will be taking the bag back monday and getting a -25 degree bag."
86477,0,"Unfortunately there aren't a lot of options for people with long hair who like to do BJJ or submission wrestling/standard wrestling and want to keep their hair out of the way. I had high hopes for this item, but with the way its designed it's not really practical. I have a Cliff Keen headgear, and the way this thing couples with it is a little odd. You can kinda see from the picture how it works. Basically you wrap the slicker over the top of the headgear, and thread the headgear's chinstrap through two openings on either side of the slicker. For anyone who has used headgear, you know that they're not sturdy and are flimsy. Since this is the case, trying to tuck your hair under this thing while it's attached to the headgear and simultaneously trying to adjust the headgear is a pain in the butt.When you're rolling, the slicker can easily rub against the matt and get pulled backwards towards the neck, or forward towards the face, completely defeating its purpose, and actually making things worse. My solution is to tie back my hair in a ponytail, using multiple hair-ties down the length of the ponytail, then stuff the ponytail into the slicker and wear the slicker like a shower cap. THEN put the headgear on over the top of it, and don't even bother trying to put the chinstraps through the slicker. The pressure of the headgear keeps the slicker in place. The only bad thing is the slicker is going to be a little large since it's meant to go over the headgear, and can get in the way. Still better than nothing, and definitely better than trying to wear it on top of the headgear.One last thing, this thing will make your head incredibly hot, since it doesn't breathe well at all. That and it seems a little pricey since all it really is is a nylon shower cap.To sum up, there's not many choices out there for people with long hair. If you can mess with this thing and make it somewhat comfortable and easy to use, it's worth it, because the alternative of having your hair falling out and getting stepped on, tangled up, and all the other unpleasantness makes up for it."
247682,1,"I'm a longtime owner of the Classic and the Rambler, which are variations of the same.I am purchasing as a temporary stand-in for when I (frequently) am unable to locate my Rambler for extended periods (like lately). I'm sure this is a fantastic tool and the value is undeniable (approximately half the code of a Rambler), but consider the both. Dimensions appear to be identical, but Rambler includes scissors, and has the Phillips/bottle opener and knife blade opening on opposite ends relative to this tool.I find the scissors to be a very useful tool. I frequently use mine for trimming hangnails, hairs, strings, and even for stripping wires. I don't find them as essential as the Phillips/bottle opener, but useful enough that it will be difficult to not have them.In addition, the ""flip"" of the knife and Phillips is important, though the Rally and Rambler each may have a unique strength here. On the Rambler, having the blade flip away from the keyring (assuming you use it) provides a major advantage vs having it flip toward the keychain (I recall this from my Classic days). However, I frequently had to undo my keychain when using the Phillips on the Rambler, do to the difficulty with spinning the screwdriver so close to a ring of keys. These removals are one of the main reasons my Rambler often ends up separated from my keys and lost! I suspect the opposite end with the Rally with make this less necessary, but that I will still frequently end up removing the tool from the keychain when using the screwdriver.I'm sure this is a great tool, but if you want a fantastic tool and you're not prone to losing these things, I would recommend ""splurging"" on aRamblerfor two reasons: the knife is more useful when it opens away from the keyring, and it has an addition tool (scissors) with virtually no additional bulk."
6187,1,"As others have said, this basket will only hold about 60 balls if you want to close the lid. I find it very easy to pick up balls with it. And its sturdy enough, it might wobble a bit, but I've had this basket out on very windy days when practicing serves and have never had it tip over on me. Also, major sporting goods stores in my area want around $40 for a basket similar to this. So this is a great value at half the price. I'm thinking of picking up a second one."

19935,0,"I ordered this tent from Amazon, They sent a tent that is NOT the one in these pictures. I have wrote them, but they have not changed their description, so here is whats different:2006:1)The entrance system is missing the two poles (that square off the top of the rain shield) and the door is totally different.2) There is NO Clean Sweep zippered floor flap3)The rain sheild(cover) lays flat against the side of the tent. It does not stay taught without the poles stated in #1. I hope you like to swim, because the cover will just lay against the huge mesh side of the tent because of this (05 has much less mesh).4) There is no wheeled carry bag as described.5) This 06 tent does NOT use a post and Grommet system. It uses a ring and pin system like most Cheaper family tents.6) There is NO removable door mat.7) More mesh(so you must use the cover) and less fabric. Perhaps it is cheaper to use mesh, and just make you use the cover.8)No hanging gear loftI recieved this 2006 tent when I actually ordered the 2005 version described here. I was very dissapointed and I have returned it.Sportsmans hopefully has the 2005 version. I just ordered from them. I hope to get the good one.It is a shame that Columbia decided to strip this tent down for 2006. YOu can see the differences on their website. It is clear that this was to maximize profit. I think they are struggling in the tent industry. North Pole is making their tents...they also make all WALMART (OZARK TRAIL) tents too... That right there makes this a little iffy to me when I think of quality. I could buy a nice 10X12 walmart tent for $49.99, or this for $119 less all the $10 off coupons codes all over the internet.We will see.Good luck. One thing I will say, is the quality of the fabric seems nice and thick. Taped seems are good too.JUst a quick note: Look at the 3rd and 4th picture. This is actually the 2006 model. All other pictures here are of the 2005 model. Notice the subtle differences. Look at the different shape, all mesh walls, door and compare to the other pics..The 3rd and 4th picture is what you actually recieve and is not described here."

It is quite stable even with a large pot on it.Unfortunately, during our summer trip it broke down. This product has a ""lifetime warranty"", so we called the support line to see how we can have it fixed.

I'm unpleased that I wasted money on glasses that I'll never wear, its the one downfall to ordering items like this on the internet. So if your a man DO NOT buy these glasses in the 54mm.

I already carry a lot of gear and I am not convinced that the weight of the knife actually lends itself to higher quality.I have had other knives that weigh less and do what I need.

19355,1,"The Boa bike mount works great at holding the bike on to your roof-rack. The BOA securely holds the bike via front quick-release-type axle clamps (the type that holds your bike wheel). You can add Yakima Lock-Cores to add some security but they are not required. Truth be told nothing is really theft proof, however the lock-cores will hold up while you take a nice break at a highway rest-area. Removing the front wheel isn't an issue if your bike has a quick release. It's actually easier to lift your bike onto a car-roof without the added weight of a front wheel. If your car-system is compatible I recommend the BOA. It's essentially the same as the yakima Copper head but without the rail, and the BOA costs a fraction of the price of the Copperhead. So same function, less money :-)"

157390,2,"When purchasing an exercise bike I had read a review where someone recommended this seat. I ordered it along with the exercise bike only to find out that the seat is not removeable on the exercise bike. So I decided to try this on my regular bicycle.It was easy to install and looked really comfy. I really wanted to like this seat and left it on my bike for a couple of weeks. Everytime I went to ride my bike I was miserable. My husband tried adjusting it and it just did not work for me. First, if you have ridden a bike for fifty years you get use to how a seat should feel. This is totally different and I was accepting of that fact. The seat is very slick and I felt I was constantly fighting it to stay on. Also, it is flat across the front and tilts down and you also feel like to you are falling forward and about to slide down. On each bike ride I felt like I was fighting to stay on my bike. I cannot express how uncomfortable this seat was for me. My husband tried adjusting it several times and there simply is no adjustment for the downward tilt. There is nothing about the seat that helps you stay on like a conventional seat. I simply would never recommend this to anyone as I feel it is not safe. I have since replaced my regular bike seat with a gel seat which I prefer and is very comfortable."

43115,1,"I have owned my watch for about three months now. I only take it off to take a shower... otherwise, I wear it constantly. I am very happy with it and recommend it .... for what it is - an inexpensive but very functional dive watch. As irrelevant as it is, the presentation box was beautiful. The watch, right out of the box, was also beautiful. I wore a top-o-the line Tissot and an Omega Seamaster for years and never got a compliment on either one... but have received two on this watch. The band, which I had to adjust before wearing, is sturdy (not as sturdy as the Tissot's band however)and I am confident it will will do the job. The bezel is the small scalloped model and works well. On the auto-movement: when I pull out the crown to adjust the time or date it does not feel as solid as on either my Tissot or Omega. In fact it feels kind of weak. However, it to works fine. I have closely timed it with UTC, and have found my watch gaining between 44 seconds to one minute a month. I find that acceptable for a wrist watch (you have to adjust the day every other month anyway). If you want the exact time for celestial navigation purposes (as I do), you will have to buy a short-wave radio and listen to the time hacks on 15000 mhz. I have found that even quartz watches vary from UTC over a month. Bottom line: My watch is great so far. And since it was so inexpensive I don't have to worry about having it stolen, lost or smashed up, and I feel fine about wearing it even when doing rough work, and yet it obviously looks great - hence the compliments. I give it my highest recommendation for what it is."

Except it's completely unnecessary. The size and stability are overkill, and I could have easily saved money by going with a cheaper Schwinn Adjustable Kickstand which is a solid product. Why pay double for this?Save money, and time by getting a regular kickstand that mounts on the bottom plate of your bike!"

163146,0,"This is a decent size bag, the material of the bag feels like decent quality so as not to rip easily from what you pack. Downsides of the bag are the stitching - not double stitched, and the attachment locations feel too low. It did come with alice clips, and also has some straps on the back you can use to attach to a belt or a bag. The problem is that the attachments are located too low on the bag, causing it to sag. The straps sewn on the sides that look like molle straps are not molle. In the picture they provide, it appears you have two horizontal molle straps running around the bag. It is actually one think strap, too large for molle and too wide. I'm still going to use the bag, but probably just to hold light weight stuff or maybe as a small game dump bag."

The csr advises that they will send me out a replacement part, without really confirming where my tear was. As it turns out, she was going to send the top canopy instead of the part I actually needed.So she evidently now is sending me the right part and begins describing the detailed (albeit not ultra complicated) process of replacing the part. I asked if the part will come with directions. She said that it wouldn't but that if I couldn't figure it out I could call customer service back and they could walk me through it (8:00-5 CST, M-F).So now I'm retrofitted the base of this trailer that my children are supposed to ride in...not the kind of situation I thought I'd be inheriting.So far, very dissappointed."

50026,1,I was a little sceptical about such a cheap pair of bike shorts but I was suprised to see the other reviews were on. They are made well and fit well. They are comfortable on the rides I have taken but I have not taken a long ride so I can't attest to their comfort on the long haul.
211147,1,"I ordered this on Sunday and it arrived on Tuesday!! That's amazing. I have just tried them out and they feel like a perfect fit, you don't even know it's there. It doesn't fog up, it's not odd feeling, and the speed at which it arrived is also a plus. Feels comfortable, exactly what I would expect from a Speedo brand product!"
250626,0,Please don't display two items when the purchase is for only one. It is very misleading and caused a surprise for me when my package arrived.
419108,0,"I needed to order these shorts for my daughter to fit requirements of a fitness program she was going through. They fit her a little shorter than pictured on the manaquin (why don't they use real people in these pictures?), and so they didn't meet the requirements.Material is just your basic, thin stuff. But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her. I'm glad they are now using a read model. They held up for a few months before they ripped. They served their purpose."
4783,2,"For what it is, hit sleeping pad is ridiculously bulky.For car camping, I think this product is decent, though if I have the option of car camping, I think a portable cot + heat reflector (e.g. mylar blanket) is better for comfort and warmth. For backpacking, it's just way too cumbersome. I may decide to cut it as the biggest pains in sleeping in a tent is uneven ground or roots/rocks the jut up around my back and butt. My head will have the pack as a pillow and my legs aren't as easily affected, so maybe a shortened pad is all I need. But as is, this pad is not gonna cut it."
312094,0,"I usually wear a 10.5 in most shoes, including Vans, which are my normal brand. The 10.5 Chucks that arrived are almost a whole size larger than what i'm used to. They are more like 11.5 They fit fine width wise, but my toe barely reaches the white rubber in the front. So word of advice, order a size smaller than you think."
55503,0,"This knife is made solid and can take a beating. This was my very first Kershaw knife and I carried it for about a year, until I replaced it with other Kershaw models. The belt clip is solid and it sits fairly deep into your pocket. The blade has some milling and drilling designs to reduce the weight but still at 4.5 oz and it's still heavy for me. It has good `jimping' and thumb stud, so you'll get good grip on holding and opening it. Because Kershaw materials and design have improved so much over the past year, I would look at other blades from them. You'll get more value for your money."
454023,0,I ordered the watch and had it next day delivery it was 3 days late and watch was missing from box. I did call Amazon and they were very nice and are sending out a replacement watch. They also credited the shipping charges. Now that is customer service!!!
310237,0,"This is my second Eureka product. I also have a northern breeze screen room with no complaints. Based on that product, I think this tent is good with handling bad weather. The problems I have come across is in the set up and the quaility of the poles. The instuctions such as they are said look for yellow on the spider hub but there was none. It is easy enough to figure out so I proceeded to hook up the poles. I thought they sent me the wrong ones. I got it all set up and the tension on the poles exceptionally strong. I took it down and took the tent camping. It went up easier but upon tear down, I noticed that two of the poles had about a 15 degree bend in them. I have set up the tent twice and am no wondering if it will last a whole year or not"
248528,2,"Quite simply, this kit is rubbish. And dangerous too.It is so crude and flimsy that you will have an ordeal trying to boil a cup of water for tea, let alone cook anything, and will quite likely burn yourself in the process.Say you try to boil a cup of water. You use the included tiny, tiny pot with handle. First of all, the handle hangs down at just the right angle to get red hot in the stove's flame. Next, when you lift the pot (using tongs... the red hot handle will burn through gloves), it tips right over and dumps the boiling water everywhere. It just hangs freely from that wire handle and since it's so crudely made, is unbalanced and tips its contents out as soon as its lifted.After you've burned yourself and lost all your boiled water, you might try to cook something in the frying pan. First you try to assemble the handle, with the screw and wingnut.. problem is that the metal of the handle and mounting tab is so thin that you can't even tighten the bolt fully, so the pan flops about from side to side. Good luck tipping anything out of the pan without a mess. Next, if you put anything in the pan that weighs more than an ounce or two, the handle simply bends. Even a 1/2"" of water is enough to bend the handle.The whole kit is absolute rubbish. Oh, and the handle of the mug gets too hot to handle if you succeed in sloshing any hot water into it.Don't waste your time or money."
219533,1,"These shoes are often recommended as training shoes in the parkour and freerunning community, and with good reason. They are thin-soled, which means you can feel what is going on under your feet; it also makes you learn to land well and strengthens your ankles, which is particularly important for beginners. They have good grip: not as good as a pair of Five-Tens, but better than your average street shoe. Finally, they are very cheap, which easily makes up for the fact that they wear out quickly. It also means you can buy a pair to try it out without worrying about wasting a lot of money if you don't like it."
360405,1,"I have had bad luck with air mattresses in the past. I am not a small person and previous beds have all but completely deflated within a few hours. My wife and I slept comfortably on this mattress for two full nights in our tent while camping. We did put a little more air in before the second evening, but I'm not even sure it was absolutely necessary. My only complaint is also one of the things I like about this bed; It uses a proprietary pump and nozzle, but the design makes it very simple to use. The pump is easy to attach and turns itself on when in position. It automatically turns itself off and the intake on the bed re-seals as soon as you remove it, so you don't have to fumble around trying to screw a cap back on while all the air rushes out. The downside, of course, is that if the pump ever stops working, you have to get a replacement from the manufacturer. The pump also only works on it's internal battery or direct DC power from the included cigarette lighter adapter, but not on AC power from a wall socket. The AC power adapter is strictly for charging only. It does have to be completely discharged and recharged (for 12 hours) to maintain the health of the battery. Fully discharging it requires opening the cap on the mattress and attaching the pump to the valve so that it turns on without actually filling the bed. This is not an elegant method, but must be done unless you want to turn the pump into a practically useless brick. The charging issue is the reason I give it a 4 instead of 5. For a camping mattress, I think this is still a good choice, and I'm willing to overlook the problems."
99256,1,"I bought this watch to wear when I go fishing or hiking. It is light weight, very comfortable, and rugged. And the price is great!"
93254,1,Excellent product. I'm a heavy person and was able to put alot of weight on this walking stick.
476121,2,"I ordered the white color. This is only 50% cotton, so I had to throw it away (I hated the touch).Now I do see that in the description there is a note about it (50%), but since the title states clearly 100% cotton then this is very misleading and I feel I was cheated."
472278,0,"This being my first venture into automatic watches after doing quite a bit of looking at various options. I opted to go with the 8926 (mineral crystal,stamped clasp,miyota movement) over its more expensive cousin 9937 (flame fusion aka hybrid sapphire/mineral, solid clasp, swedish movement). Nevertheless, when I first got the watch--I was very impressed with the quality and appearance of the watch. The other reviewers who compared it to the Rolex Submariner aren't joking. It's very attractive watch. And it mirrors the appearance of the Submariner almost completely down to the coin edge except a couple of details: the luminescent dot for on the bezel is much larger on the Rolex, and the cyclops magnification on the 8926 is a joke. That being said, amazing bang for the buck. So I shook it around a bit to get it started and proceeded to wear it daily.A week in, I wake up to realize that it had stopped about an hour before I had woken up. Ok, charged it again. It died later on in the day. Now, when I try to charge it, it lasts maybe 3 minutes--I've tried both rocking it and winding it (40 turns is supposed to be enough for a full charge) but no avail. If you've done a bit research into Invicta timepieces, one thing you'll find is that many people complain about the quality control of their watches--and this I knew when I decided to purchase the watch. Oh well. Luckily it failed within the first 30 days so it's still covered by amazon. Time to get an exchange. Will update when I get the 2nd watch.UPDATE: So having received the replacement watch (Amazon customer support is great about sending out a replacement as soon as you file the claim so two thumbs up for them). I've had the watch for over a month now and it's working fine-unlike the first sample. Runs a couple minutes fast every month but that's to be expected for a sub-$100 automatic watch. So for the price, I'm quite happy with my purchase.WRAP-UP: Great watch in it's own right despite being a Submariner look-alike. I would recommend the watch if you are willing to take a chance with getting a really crappy watch that dies on you after amazon's return policy expires and you have to pay for shipping to send it to Invicta. So, the conclusion is that as the old adage 'you get what you pay for' still applies to this product, and though it is a handsome watch-you're taking your chances by buying one. Just pray you get lucky."
178661,1,"I like the item, I was looking for one with front zipper. Since I did not find that, I liked the price and will buy this for myself."
445945,0,"Wish they had mentioned that the reel had no reverse. Very hard to use as a casting reel without it. Would have purchased something else if I had known. I realize it is my mistake, but I have owned spinning reels all my life, from many different companies, and many different prices. First one I have ever seen without a reverse. Would not purchase this model again."
254423,0,"I've bought a couple cases of this paint over the last summer. I'm not sure if it happened to be my cases or the paint in general, but a very large percentage of paintballs had dimples straight out of the box. Of the samples I took, about 50% had small to significant dimples. I'm not sure if the distributer had them sitting for a long time or what, but but that's not the quality that I like.Another thing to note is that these balls run pretty small. If your ball detent is broken or balls get into your barrel, they will roll out on their own. This may be different with your barrel, but something to keep in mind. They didn't break in my gun and I was very satisfied with the good balls. You could definitely tell which shots had dimples since they curved quite a bit."
240470,1,Good quality shirt running true to sizing. I was hoping for a heavier material for a more rugged workout shirt. I live in California and this March/April I found wearing a tee shirt underneath provided a more comfortable feel. This shirt would be great for spring and early fall.
37356,2,"I bought this item from Amazon at a good price, but when it arrived it was short and blousy...too wide, yet too short. It's a shame because the materials are typical Columbia excellence."
493533,0,"PROS:* Solar charge* Built like a tank (and weighs as one), nice to the touch resin, metal clasp* 200M waterproof* Backlight works well for the analog display* Good set of features if you care about them (timer, countdown, pre-programmed world calendar, home/world time, etc.)CONS:* Barely legible face is too small, deeply recessed, cramped and looks busy* Digital display is small and can't show date and week day at once, has to cycle every 2 seconds* To my tastes the case is too fat but not wide enough - the watch looks like a lump of coal on your wrist* Atomic signal sync is pointless to me - can't get a signal anywhere in NYC where I live or work (Manhattan)* Supports only one time sync station (but that's' expected for the price)* Auto-backlight is an annoying gimmick, lights up randomly when you move hand, better to be switched off* User manual is hard to follow and vague, requires patience to figure things out* Watch button interface isn't the most logical and straightforwardIt's my first modern G-Shock and as you can see from above I'm disappointed and will probably send GW1500A-1AV back. But please take it with a grain of salt, it's just my personal opinion. Each one's tastes, requirements and usage are different.I won't wax poetic about many nice features. I listed all the goodies I can recognize in PROS above and many people already reviewed and raved about this watch. As you can see my main personal disappointment is the smallish face size relative to the big and thick case. I love big watches, not because of fashion but because big case usually affords for big legible face which is easy to see at a glance, both analog time and digital date. Unfortunately it's not the case (pun indented) with this GW1500A-1AV watch. It seems to be an old design, rather big and fat but face area from which you can read time information is just meager 20 mm. There's a wide pointless rim around it. On top of that the face is rather deeply recessed affording sort of ""tunnel vision"". Messy color scheme (e.g. white minute handle on greyish/blue-ish background) and two pointless small circular displays don't help the cause either. There's simply too much cramped onto the small surface. Instead of two other barely legible displays Casio could've added a second handle and make digital display bigger so it can show date and weekday simultaneously and not cycle through them every 2 seconds.Granted I understand that this ""lump of coal"" construction was driven in part to make it shock and water proof. But looking at more recent, admittedly also more expensive, G-Shocks I can see that now they make case wider (at 50mm at least 10mm more than GW1500A-1AV) and not that thick. Accordingly useable face diameter grows to 30mm from 20mm.I'll probably will get of the Casio's new XL series G-Shocks such as ""GA110-1A XL""."
438791,1,"A lot of tents this size are fairly easy to set up, but I have to say that this is one of the easiest. I set it up at 2am, in the pitch dark...and it took me less than 10 minutes. Enough said.Some other great features: the sun/moon roof is great for ventilation and a view of the stars, the mesh pockets and mesh net at the top and conveniently located, and the tent withstands heat pretty well.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied!!!"

207343,0,I ordered this watch for my son whose favorite color is red but had to return it because the color is more like a washed out burgundy rose color. Other than that it was the perfect size and design.
79569,1,PERFECT SIZE TO REPLACE THE PLASTIC BOX IN MY SentrySafe. This is a well built metal box and the right size for SentrySafes. I've had a SentrySafe for several years and the only thing I didn't like about it is the plastic box that comes in it. The safe is a 2 hour fire safe but having this metal box for valuables and cash in a fiberglass pouch should add another layer of fire protection.I recommend this box. It is well made and a good value for the price.

175428,0,"Bad points, your hand gets tired quickly pumping 100 times to fill a lawn tractor gas tank.

19271,0,"Be warned... this item looks nothing like the picture. It is a Phillies visor and it is nice. But the one sent is a crisp, brand new style visor rather than the distressed look pictured here. It is New Era brand and even called ""dugout visor"" on the label. It is red and has the logo on the front (and the name on the velcro strap). But it is not distressed and the red is more a bright red, like the Phillies jerseys. Also the front is a bit taller/higher and more firm than in the picture, so it sits more like a Titleist golf visor than a casual cloth visor. Not sure if any of this makes sense, but was worth passing along in case others were going to buy."

277647,0,"I hoped rowing would be a good total body workout, but as a 5'3"" relatively out-of-shape woman I had to set it on an extremely light setting to be able to go for 20-30 minutes, and even then I felt the strain on my neck muscles and my hands went numb (carpal tunnel syndrome) without feeling it much in my abs or getting a very good cardiovascular workout. Maybe I was doing it wrong or maybe I'm too short. One foam grip fell apart quickly and duct tape was not a good replacement, too sticky to the touch. Stamina did send me a replacement grip on request. Oiling helped the squeaking problem, but the machine kept shedding fine metal dust from moving parts, not sure what was wearing out but would probably be a problem if I had used it frequently."

485236,0,"A lot of people have negative reviews and I don't really get it. It is a solid crafted, extremely sharp knife. The sheath is a good quality leather one. I purchased it for $13.80 and there is nothing to complain about for that price. I would have happily paid 30+ for it.Several Months Later:I still appreciate the knife but found it dulls out rather quickly. Edge retention is a definite issue, so if you don't feel that you can make quick and easy of regular sharpening, this probably isn't the knife for you. It is detracting, but for the price, I don't mind sharpening more often."

They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed. I received the pants and they were made in China and didn't fit anything like the other 3 do. I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS. The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it. This was emailed from Zac. I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number. I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon. I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account. Fortunately, I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June.

You could theoretically modify the movements to be easier on joints and ligaments, but there are no modifications given on the DVD.I got into this and quickly lost about 7 lbs. in only 17 days. I looked and felt better. However, I eventually developed tendinitis in my ankles and was unable to complete the program. I had appropriate shoes and good padding on the floor. After my tendinitis healed (several weeks), I tried it again, and my tendinitis came back.There are likely many people out there with strong enough tendons and joints to handle the program. I was not one of them. I have also talked to many others who have had injuries and issues when attempting to tackle this program.Shaun T. is excellent and motivating, but make no mistake, this program is intense and not intended for everyone. There are other ways to get fit that are much safer for your body. I personally think P90X is a much more well balanced, safe, modifiable, and effective program."

I threw it away. The flashlight did work, and I attached it. The sight's battery cap keeps falling off, exposing the battery.After this, I plugged it in to charge for roughly an hour and a half. When I came back, I put it in the gun, went outside, pulled the trigger and...nothing happened.I fiddled with the battery for a bit: It fired a few times, and then stopped working completely.I am utterly angry and dissatisfied with this gun.

Well, I didn't, and now whenever I wear it, I find myself trying to put my hands into a front pocket that isn't there.Another slightly annoying thing is that the wrist cuffs are pretty tight, so if you try to push your sleeves up to do something, it can be somewhat uncomfortably tight.On the positive side, it is a nice warm underlayer and is a clean, casual look with jeans. I like it, I just wish it had pockets."

I finally gave up and have yet to find anything else."
100513,1,This heart rate monitor comes with a 30+ page instruction book! I read it and set it up two months ago and used it for a week while walking on a treadmill. It provides much better readings than my monitor on the treadmill. I then set it aside while on a trip and came back to it a few weeks later. I inadvertently hit the wrong button (only one button) and got into different menus and submenus and got lost. I have not gotten the book out to reset it all. I would like a product that I do not have to read and reread so much. Can you put a nice flow chart of steps for stepup or a organization chart with submenus and subsubmenus so that one doesn't have to read and reread the instruction book to use it.
342285,0,"I purchased this watch as a daily watch that would get some abuse and sweat. I liked the fact that it had both an analog and digital portion. I cannot comment much on the function of the watch because I did not keep it. The wristband was about the weirdest design I had ever seen. I am a 6'2"" male with fairly skinny wrists (~ 6.75 inch circumference). The watch band caused the watch to sit way up above my wrist to the point that it looked very awkward. Not only that, it isn't the thinnest of watches to begin with, so I would fear it would be getting caught on things all the time. If I tightened the band way down, I could get some of the gap to go away, but at this point the watch was simply uncomfortable to wear. Given the good reviews, I assume most people did not have this problem except for the couple that said exactly what I am telling you. Also, the weird undulations in the band as seen by the picture are not soft and stretchy like I had imagined. Instead it is hard, stiff plastic which I assume is the source of the problem."

205049,0,"We've used this coffee maker on several car-camping trips and at home on the stove. It creates a good, quality cup of coffee. We have had trouble getting the coffee to come out without sputtering and spraying coffee all over. It also seems to go through a phase of ""making coffee"" and ""sputtering"" coffee several times before completing its job. We've tested this on our stove at home, so it does not seem to be a function of uneven heating.Ultimately, we'd love to take this on backpacking trips, but with the difficulty controlling the output of the coffee, its not quite ""leave no trace"" -- nor advisable in areas with bears or other potentially dangerous animals. For that, I suppose, we are again relegated to the realm of instant coffee.But, for getting my caffeine fix for low-key car style camping events, its perfect!"

Regent asks for the item number, which is nowhere found on the product. (It was on the box: ""you mean you didn't keep the huge box for a year?""

300017,1,"After reading many reviews, I decided on this binoculars for its price and zoom range. I purchased it new for $60 plus tax in May 2009. We went on an Alaska cruise and continued on with a RV to Denali NP. I used it almost every day extensively and I would definitely say that I am very happy with my decision. It is probably not the best binoculars but for the price and what I need for my trip, I am very happy with it.It has great and clear optics. I love the ability to zoom in and out. It allows me to see thing with a wide view and zoom it if I see things of interest. It was great to spot eagles (In Glacier Bay NP,I was able to spot an eagle on an iceberg so far away) and big manmals in Denali. The 8x-16x is just right. At 16x, I have to be very steady. I can not see how I can get my hands to be steadier for more powerful zoom.I would definite recommend everyone to get a zoom binos over a fixed one, it is so much more interactive and fun!!The 40mm lens is also great. There is very little lost of light as you zoom in on a object or scen. Yes, it is just a heavier than the small compact one.I also bought a harness for it and I would recommend that you do if you are going to carry it extensively. It takes the weight off your neck and frees your hand to do other things. The harness allows me to switch back and forth between the camera and the binos.Two things that could be better:1-there is a minute distortion at the very edge of the view if you look very carefully.2-It looses focus a bit when you zoom all the way in or out. You have to refocus.Over all, it is a great binos with its price!"

76134,1,"I was going to add a more sophisticated safe in my trunk. Something that bolts down and more heavy duty. However, I purchased this for $$ reasons and that it did not require any mounting difficulties.I really like this safe for its convenience. It fits perfectly under my seat and any prying eyes will not be able to see it there. I was afraid that if someone broke into my car they could pop the trunk release and then see a safe in there, there-by causing more damage trying to steal it or its contents. If they break into my car now, it's possible that they may not even look under the seats...maybe.But in my scenario, if they do look under the seats and find the safe, if they have bolt cutters with them, they will probably be able to steal it. The wire, although strong is not very thick; although it will definately stop the average thief from smash and grab.That being said, it is easy for the owner to get much thicker wire and ""upgrade"" his own safe.If you are looking for an in-expensive and reliable safe that is easy to mount, this is a very good safe."

163768,0,This is an OK bivy for the price. The Delrin Hoop Frame that holds the bivy away from your face is more or less a joke. Its a plastic rod that is impossible to put into any other shape other than the twisted loop it arrives in in the package. I broke mine trying to get it to loosen up a little bit. Its not necessary anyway. I haven't used mine in any seriously bad weather yet. When I do I'll update this.

Just remove the red plastic cap that protects the fuel nozzle, place the can in the stove with the notches aligned, and push the lock lever into place. The lock lever loads the canister securely.The only drawback is that these are not sold locally so I can only get them online, and it costs more than the mini propane tanks. The tiny size of the stove and canisters is a plus, and the reason I purchased the unit.Update Aug 2012: Used the stove tent camping this summer at a local campground. We cooked several meals using the same canister, and the small stove was hot at a medium/low setting. The small canister size is easy to pack."

465594,0,"I bought these after reading several other reviews from different sites. I returned them the next day. They are simply not worth the money. Go to Home Depot and buy a nice $20 pair of work gloves (and add a very thin, useless layer of insulation) and you have the same thing.Also I read that these gloves run small in their sizing. I bought an XL (which I normally wear) and they were quite a bit too large for my hands. Since they are work gloves, they need to be on the tighter side to be useful. There is too much slack in the palm and the fingers are too long. I've read a lot of good things about these gloves, and maybe the size large would work better, but I was not impressed for a rather high price tag."
396960,1,"The handlegrips are just like everyone else said. They're a little bigger than the handlebars but not by much,(at least mine weren't, I have the older 25.4 clamp size bars.)

The tape I used isn't the foam kind though, it's very thin and is pretty much scotch tape but stronger. I wish I could tell you where I got it but I can't remember. I also used the amber Zinsser Shellac on them to make them weather proof and last longer. The shellac is at Ace Hardware for $7.99 for a 1/2 pint and it only last 3 years before it goes bad. The one I bought was 4 years old, it worked but check the date on the bottom of the can and get one within the 3 year mark. Overall the grips are worth the money. They come out looking good after they're finished."

(If I had wanted another men's size of the same style they would have only charged postage one way.)Also, it would be helpful for them to label their products better.

150580,0,"A bit of history--I have been doing the P90X routines regularly since they came out a few years ago and they have vastly altered my approach to exercise. I might even go so far as to say they were ""life changing."" P90X even got me interested in Yoga which I previously dismissed as ridululous for exercise. Prior to that, I regularly lifted weights with an emphasis on size and strength. As a result of P90X, my overall fitness, health, and flexibility have improved but I have to admit that my strength has diminished a bit. I have also used the P90X Plus routines and have enjoyed those; however, I do not use them as much as the originals.Now for P90X2. I was looking forward to some new DVD's, new workouts, and new challenges. Admittedly, I have only tried a few of the new workouts so far. The workouts seem a bit easier than the previous P90X and you will not be able to use as much resistance because of the balance portion of the exercise. The workouts seem pretty good, but not as good. The stretching portion does seem much better and I do like the inclusion of the foam roller.The biggest disadvantage of P90X2 is also the biggest weakness of the original--Tony Horton's constant talking. It is even worse in P90X2 than the original. I tried the Shoulders and Arms routine for the first time tonight and almost turned it off after the warm up because of the constant disruptive chatter.If you have tried P90X and need some new challenges, get Supreme 90. It's an obvious rip off of the P90X concept, but it does offer some new, challenges workouts, more muscle confusion, and a lot less annoying talking from the host. I picked it up at Dunham's sporting goods for less than $20 and didn't even know it existed. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality.I think that I'll be taking advantage of the money back guarantee and returning P90X2 to beachbody."
97676,2,"This was my very first solar-powered watch. Three years ago, I saw it while walking past a watch store at a local shopping mall, and the price tag said ""$50"" (about US$33), so I bought it on impulse.At that point in time, I've always thought that solar powered watches cost at least $500 or more. Imagine my delight at finding a cheap solar powered watch!However, my joy was pretty short-lived. A couple of weeks down the road, while wearing it, it switched off right in the middle of the day! Lunchtime in fact, while I was out walking around in bright sunlight! Hands stopped moving, LCD screen blank except for a ""LO C"" blinking indicator. It was impossible since I have never seen the watch move from the ""Hi"" battery level indicator before.An hour later it turned itself back on while I was back in the office. Hands moved to the correct time, LCD screen was back on, and the battery indicator said ""Hi"".A few incidents similar to this happened a few times, in the following months. So much so that I decided to junk this watch and threw it inside my drawer, never touching it for about 8 months or so.Recently, I took it out of the drawer again and the watch turned itself back on when it was exposed to light. Battery Indicator said ""MID"". So I left it on the window sill for 3 days straight, hoping that it stays at ""Hi"".On the 4th day, I wore it out. We went to the movies, and right in the middle of the movie when I wanted to check the time, I pressed the backlight and... nada. No reaction. I tilted the watch to let the light from the movie shine on it and saw the watch had turned itself off AGAIN, about 40 mins ago (checked time with my mobile phone).Somewhere along the way, still during the same movie, the watch turned itself on again, because suddenly I heard it do the hourly beep thing. Now, I know for sure that the watch was not exposed to light in any way, and even if it did, the light from the movie is nowhere near powerful enough to charge it up to turn it back on.My take is this - it's too cheap to send it back to Casio for servicing. If it works while you wear it, enjoy it. It will suck when it doesn't.The other thing about Casio analogue watches which I didn't like much is that the ""luminous paint"" on the hands is almost useless. It glows for like only 15 mins and then stop glowing. Practically useless. It's not just on this watch - I own a couple of other Casio digi-ana watches from the G-Shock line and every single one of them had the same problem of short-lived glowing luminous hands and markers."
140395,1,"Having never used a video game to get in a workout, I have to admit, I really like this game. It's a fun experience and I hope this is just the beginning stages of this kind of product and that in the future we will see more graphically sophisticated games created.My only issue is that I would have liked more variety when it came to the activities. I don't like dancing, tennis or basketball. I found the skateboarding challenge hard on my knees. I also don't even bother with the upper body exercises because you just can't get an effective workout. So, that leaves me with track, boxing and lower body. All good, but I want more. Hopefully they will add more in future versions."
361585,0,"We have had this ball for 2 weeks now. The texture is nice and tacky but a bit stiff. The panels are a bit flat and the seams are raised more than any other ball I have used. A good way to see this is to roll the ball across the floor and observe how it ""bounces"" a bit. Other balls roll without any noticeable bouncing. The raised seams require a player to pass the ball very deliberately, making very good contact with both forearms. I do not know if the ball will break in and become more round. Just be aware that when new, the seams are noticeably high."
377692,0,"These panniers were an impulse buy because I could get them shipped to me overnight for a longer bike ride coming up. When they arrived they were a bit smaller than I had expected. I would also recommend someone to buy waterproof panniers, which these are not. It only has the main pouch and a pocket in the lid, so finding things on the road is a pain.The system it uses to attach to your bike is very simple, so if that's what you're looking for, great. However, this system entails two clips to hold the panniers on my back rack and sometimes one of them will fall off leaving my pannier hanging by one.Would I recommend these panniers? No. Would I recommend panniers in general? Yes (that is why I gave it 3 stars). It sure beats wearing a backpack and having a huge sweat stain on your back all day :)"
204564,0,"The only real issue I have with these is they are very hard to inflate and you have to be very careful when pushing in the needle to do so. I actually pressed to hard on one and pierced the topside plastic, ruining it. I had to use a light duty electric to get the inflation I desired. The hand pump would have taken an hour probably. I ordered a 3rd disc as a replacement for the one I ruined, and the valve leaked when trying to inflate. It got to a certain partial inflation and would just leak out as you pumped. I checked with soapy suds for leaks, it was just the value and only when pushing air i. I returned it. I purchased an SPRI disc at Sports Authority to replace and it inflated very easily. I will use the ExerTools Dyna Disc I have and it is functional, but I would not purchase another one."
79096,0,This light works well on street lighted streets. It also works reasonably well on unlit streets. Where it has problems are on streets that have a lot of traffic or ones that have street lights spaced farther apart. The light is bright enough to use when its dark and fills in the shadows on well lit streets. Where it has problems are on medium lit areas. Those are areas that have some street lights and traffic. The problem is the WhiteLite fades out in these areas and when you leave them it takes a few moments to adjust your eyes again.
391100,1,"To say that I'm hard on knives is a huge understatement, which is why this quickly became my favorite knife. My red handled stepchild gets beaten on a regular basis and has yet to let me down. It's super easy to resharpen to hair shaving status, and keeps its edge fairly well. Its not the prettiest knife around, the spine had the classic crappy stamped knife roughness that I ground smooth soon after getting it, but it feels surprisingly good in hand. There's no other way to describe the sheath other than... it sucks. Minute cosmetic issues and a crappy sheath aside, this knife is a solid performer and has been the best all around woods knife I've found so far.

I took a package of them camping and my friends laughed at me, but after it was the middle of the night and pouring rain and my friends had to either go out in the rain or make themselves wait for relief, they apologized to me in the morning. I also found these things very comforting on a long road trip in a state that provides no sanitary facilities in its rest stops.I suggest that you separate them into individual zippy plastic bags when you get them. That way you can remove it from its plastic bag, use it, drop it back in the plastic bag, seal it, and dispose of it appropriately. The zippy plastic bag helps ensure there is no odor.

Thank goodness it didn't happen while the bike was being ridden. The bike in general is good heavy metal, the tires are good and sturdy, yet the most important part that holds the wheel on to the rest of the bike is plastic. It was returned promptly.In my opinion the bike is dangerous."
395148,2,"I really don't know what the designers were thinking when they made this, or what I was thinking when I bought it. A nice novelty, I guess, but makes horrible ice cream. The opening is so small that you can't actually mix any of the ingredients, making the whole thing an exercise in futility. Buyer Beware, I guess."
197920,0,"The biggest disappointment was that the Christmas gift arrived with a defunct battery. Razor replaced the battery. There is a big notice on the handle bars that states that the scooter cannot be left in freezing temps. That info is nowhere to be found in the product description. It's post Christmas and the low tomorrow is 13* in NC. We have to keep the scooter, which is large, in the laundry room. The battery is not easily accessed otherwise we would just remove the battery and bring it inside. The tire stems are difficult to access to add air. We have a nice pump but have to purchase an adapter to put air in the tires. So far this product has not been worth our money however, our son has enjoyed riding it."
18648,0,"Please take into account that this is my first Soft Tip dart purchase. I am a longtime thrower of steel tip darts and tend towards heavier darts. Although the set is very nice, it may take some time to get accustomed to the light weight of many soft tip darts (apparently a restriction due to the electronic boards). In addition, the grip could be a bit more positive. I am use to holding the dart in a certain way and the shape of the barrel on this dart interferes with that grip."
78025,0,"Important to mention that picture placed is not accurate since the product received is the one with Three-slot design, dual-position or strong-side carry. Not too bad, but I miss the old version with only two belt loops, which by the way was the one I thought I was buying. Finally, I have to say that once in your belt, it bends to shape the gun and becomes bulky so part of the concealment porpoise is gone. NOT VERY HAPPY with my purchase considering I went for what I saw in the picture."
336427,0,I purchase this dart set as a gift for my son. He really likes the darts. The weight of the dart and the wing makes this a great dart to throw. My major complaint is that back of the dart set wing broke. Does anyone know where we can get a replacement wing? The wing screws into the back of the dart.
337421,1,"This is the first pedomenter I've owned that really works. It's easy to set up, works whether on your shoulder or in a pocket or on your waist. Just be sure to qive it credit and know what you're looking for-it counts steps plus aerobic steps in a different mode. Resets at midnight but keeps 7 days in memory. Trying for 10000 steps a day? It's harder than you think-this will help you reach your goal!"

370469,0,"The colors and sizes provides many choices for a great casual sportswear vest. You get what you pay for, hence the lack of a lining or belted back. The material is pretty thick so it wears flat and looks great. Use it as an inexpensive way to class up restaurant wait staff, match up your church choir, or make yourself a bit flashy. It lacks a breast pocket so skip the hanky look.I bought the dark green vest and had the buttons replaced with gold tone metal ones to make this a Christmas Elf vest. Had the button holes enlarged as a result. Add a red shirt and you have a very nice Christmas look for mere dollars.Sometimes it is not how much you spend, but how you use it. Very nice deal."
134181,0,"I ordered this flag in combination with 2 others from the same manufacturer. I was slightly disappointed with this one in that, although the measurements were listed as the same, this one was noticeably shorter when hung when hung next to the other two. Also, the razorback is only a single layer as opposed to the double layer of fabric on the rest of the flag. I'm afraid it may not hold up as well as the true double layer flags. That being said, it looks nice."

No holes in it, but it has a big section which is frayed and looks like someone used a hot glue gun to fix it. Quality is poor. I wouldn't recommend it."

The second day was a different story (It got trown softly) and stuck in a tree I finally got it down and oh my gosh it wouldn't flie at all. It was flat.

443816,0,"The Polar Bottles really do a good job of keeping drinks cold and they tend to ""sweat"" less than other bottles. They also have fun designs. However, after several months of use, this (and another we have) started to leak. It was leaky to the point that water would run down one's face, whenever one would try to take a drink. Now, we did use the bottles a lot in that time and each one was washed in the dishwasher several times a week. Perhaps if we'd hand-washed them, they would have lasted longer. I also found their internal design (with curves and crannies) made for difficult washing."

482921,1,"I generally go through a new knife every 6 months. I picked this knife up on sale and it has lasted longer than any knife before it. This is the first Kershaw I had owned and have subsequently bought another and have wholeheartedly recommended this brand to everyone. I have my knife on my person daily and use it for everything from a knife to a screwdriver and prybar. It allows me to maintain my jack of all trades mentality and gives me a universal tool to act on anything. This knife is very comfortable to carry and tucks away at the side of your pocket. I did flip the clip over to reverse the direction of the knife. It has remained razor sharp and the speed safe opening means you can have a hand on something and fluidly pull and open the knife with zero effort. I was originally worried that the tip would snap off like so many other knives before it because the knife is a very fine point. I am happy to say that even after several instances where I fully expected it to break but had to get something open or off, the tip is still there. Bar none best knife I have ever owned."
70000,0,"I would not consider myself to have large facial features, but i think the large size would fit me better than a medium. After wearing this for a couple of hours the bridge of my nose is very sore, it still hurts the next day. Maybe I have it too tight, but I couldn't get a good seal without tightening it. Oterwise it works great, I like the lightweight filters as compared to my other dust mask (MSA i think)MSA Safety Works 817663 Multi-Purpose Respiratorwith the large plastic filters that hang out a ways. But even with the heavier filters on my other mask, it isn't uncomfortable to wear all day. I would suggest getting a large if you have any doubt as to the fit."
347778,0,"I decided to try and exercise more, and gain some more muscles so I bought some weights and needed a bench. For the price this isn't that bad, pretty good actually. But it is a bit small for me, being 6'3"". The padded bench is small for me, but shouldnt be an issue for those of smaller statures. Assembling the bench was quite an adventure, as others have written some parts are not labeled correctly. Also some of the bolts, screws and washers come packaged in different boxes. There is a large piece of cardboard with the majority of the hardware attached to it via plastic, but some are scattered around. This was one of the major drawbacks, not only was it frustrating to look for the missing screws/bolts, but it also added to the build time. Overall build time was around 3 hours for me and my brother, with constant searching for missing hardware and for the tools needed. Once assembled the bench is pretty large, well planted and stable. Build quality is pretty good, except for the paint which peels off with the slightest touch. Also, my bench already had some surface rust on it, I'm guessing from sitting around so long and maybe during shipment, but I can see past that (some spray paint will cover that up)Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. It's a great bench with some quirks for an amazing price."

378402,2,I love Freestyle watches but this wristband is HUGE......not made for an average size woman. I'm not talking about the width is the band. I can slide this off my wrist when it's closed......so don't order this watch unless you want to replace the band before you get this watch......I am totally disappointed in this watch.
243609,0,"The material is a little scratchy and lighter weight than I expected, but all in all this is a good product at the price. I will say they don't seem to stretch out of shape as fast as other brands.If you are looking for higher quality (and price) get the Champion version."

I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE!"
213239,2,"We should have paid attention to the other reviews. This came to us damaged in 4 different places. I don't understand why they don't package the item better to prevent damage? And the stain on the board was smudged, as if they didn't wait long enough before packing it up."
354229,0,"I ordered these to wear during workouts (WiiFit, Tae-Bo, and Yoga). I ordered a 38EU, which should have been a bit small, if anything, according to the sizing chart. Not so. They are actually about a size (or 1 1/2 size) too big. It's a shame, because they seem to be nice, otherwise, and would be great for working out. Lightweight, and seem to be well made. I'm going to give them to my sister, who should be able to fit them."
86723,1,"VERY easy to open with one hand, very sharp, and easy to sharpenOnly reason it got a 4 was how loose the pocket clip gets. I've owned the knife for about 6-7 months now, use it quite oftne, and the clip is very loose.The slot for cutting paracord, even for paracord, its borderline useless. It itleast looks cool.I made the mistake of trying to pry something with it and chipped the tip some, nothing someone who knows how to sharpen a knife cant fix (which wasn't me but a friend heh).I recently puchased the SOG Kilowatt, this knife has become one that I carry around when not doing a lot of work, and the kilowatt is my work knife. Love both of them and would easily buy again."

92263,1,"The only reason I do not give five stars is because it is not silent but it is pretty quiet and for under $100 it's one of the decade's best bargains. First let me say that I am a 53 year old female and in fairly good shape. My main exercise is walking - I walk five miles at least four times a week (also use my bike to run errands and shop). I wanted something to do on my no-walk days that would work different muscles. The Gazelle is fun and not difficult or unpleasant so of course I'm thinking ""this can't be doing any good"". No Pain No Gain right? But walking doesn't hurt and is enjoyable too and it does plenty of good so why can't the Gazelle be fun and still effective? I do 30 - 40 minutes on the Gazelle about three times a week, sometimes to a TV program and sometimes to music. When working out to music the Gazelle is exceptionally accomodating in that you can adjust your pace and stride to match ANY tempo. You can really go at it on this thing or you can take it easy. I like being able to alter the intensity. The fact that it is pleasant and enjoyable is more important than you might think - the more fun it is the more apt you are to use it and I don't care how expensive or ""efficient"" a piece of equipment is if you don't enjoy using it eventually YOU WON'T and how much good will it do then? The Gazelle will be your buddy, not the enemy sitting there waiting to punish you. I have rigged mine up with padded cotton on the foot platforms and cotton socks pulled over the handles so that I can just get on barefoot with no preparation whatsoever and go. All I'm in contact with is cotton which feels really good when you heat up. Hands up high on the handles and you are getting a good upper body workout, hands in the middle section and you are sharing the load between upper and lower body, hands low down and your legs are doing most of the work. As fun and easy as it is when I get off my legs are wobbly so I know for certain that I have been exerting myself. You can work out in many ways like others have said in their reviews - twisting, leaning forward or back, bending you knees, up on your toes, etc. I didn't get a video but lively music will spur you to move in new and creative ways if you get into it. It's like dancing! I did not bother with the electronic read-out thing - it looks pretty useless to me. The clicks and squeaks (and yes I made sure all connections were tight) are not that bad, you can still easily watch TV or listen to music. I have my TV watching/CD playing device right smack in front of my face when I am on the Gazelle, as close as it can be considering the forward swing of the pedals. The whole thing is a simple system of frame and swinging foot platforms suspended by cables - NO PISTONS TO HEAT UP AND LEAK. If there are animals in your house that don't have enough sense to stay away from the Gazelle when you are using it (you know the type) you will want to put your Gazelle in a room or area that can be closed off. Frame tubing is fat and comes in a nice looking silvery gray finish. It's not what would be considered compact so you will need plenty of floor space - at least 34"" wide and 74"" long to allow for full swing. One reviewer mentioned clips that would hold the foot platforms against the tubing when folding the Gazelle but I have yet to find those on mine, maybe I have a different model. Personally I am really glad that I do not have to fold and store mine, it's heavy and big and I'm certain I'd never use it if I had to go through that much trouble. I highly recommend the Gazelle for people who have the space to keep it up and the time to use it for at least 30 minutes several times a week. I had knee pain from a step machine but I do not have knee pain from the Gazelle."

Assembly was a breeze.This was a gift for a Mets fan. Even though it is a youth product, we hang out clothes on it. It works fine. It's sturdy and has not tipped over even under the weight of several layers of adult clothing.The only complaint I have for the manufacturer is that the package arrived with 3 stickers on 3 different sides of the box that showed the product. This was ordered as a gift, so when it arrived, the recipient knew what was in the box immediately."

408057,1,"Everything about this purchase has been pleasing. The price was better than I found in local stores. The packaging was surprisingly sound. It was received without any dings, or chips. I like the straight handle, as opposed to the ergo handle. (This is probably just a personal preference.) Though the dumbbell isn't rubber coated, most of the exercises I perform are unilateral so the dumbbells rarely touch. If I were to purchase dumbbells for bench press I would consider a rubberized weight. (Though, again, cost would probably keep me from doing so.) This weight is ideal for home use; bicep curls, tricep extensions, overhead press, lunges, door stop... Though I visit the local gym on a regular basis I love having the option to do smaller workouts at home."

172179,1,"I Have had the Kershaw Blur for a couple months now, since I am a trash man the knife takes an extreme beating against the side of the trash truck. This was something that the S&W; Border Guard could not handle in the slightest. The Blur has handled that with flying colors and I could not ask for more in terms of how well the knife has stayed put together.I know that Two months does not sound like a long time but since most pocket knives can't last that long with me and this knife hasn't got more that a scratch on it, I think it passes the test.The knife features decent but limiting contours in the handle, and a very nice skateboard tape-like texture that makes it very easy to grip. Though the Blur is not my first choice for a self defence knife, the fast acting ""Assisted"" opening action makes it fairly well suited for the rapid deployment that proves to be helpful in combative situations. Not to mention if you work with work gloves it makes it very easy to open wearing them.Kershaw falls a little bit in my book when using the blade steel they have chosen, I think many knife makers should learn from Cold Steel and use more premium steel for their blades, but this knifes steel seems perfectly suited for light to moderate cutting tasks. I would also like to add that the slim point of the blade makes it really good for EDC tasks like cleaning the finger nails, pulling staples etc...Overall if this knife feal comfortable to you it is a very decent knife and worth the fifty dollars I spent as it will not fail to function.[...]"

466510,0,"These grips do make a huge difference in how my pistol feels in my hand. The only down side is the installation of this product. I mean would it kill you to add some screws that were just a tad longer. I ended up having to use a wratchet strap to squeeze the grips into place to get the holes to line up and get screws started. Try this technique it may save you some time, I tried using a hair dryer to heat the rubber up enough to strech it into place but to no avail. Well after 45 minutes of wrestling with these grips, I finally got them on and they feel awsome. Can't wait to get to fire my new and improved side arm. Happy shooting."

396411,0,"It is a decent product and works for us but the fit is not very good on our Rinker. The elastic is of poor quality, in my opinion, and did not hold well after stretching, which it has to do in order to go over the seat.

To be more precise, they are too small in the groin area. I noticed that since I got them that I am constantly pulling and readjusting.

I should have researched it more but I assumed(yea,I know what it means)that Bagwell wouldn't allow a knife with his name on it to be made of stainless, I guess you just can't trust the writers to practice what they preach."

297830,0,"This disc is great in terms of flight characteristics when new; it's stable and straight, and an arm with bad habits (like mine) can still drive this 300+ feet reasonably consistently.However, it is not very durable. After playing my local 18 hole course about 3 or so times using this as my primary driver, the edges of this disc are fairly ragged and need to be trimmed and smoothed out. For the same price, I'd go with a CE edition plastic (or tougher) from an Innova line. My local course is primarily dirt, sporadic brush and pine (ie, not dense), little rock and no granite. I'd expect more given those conditions from even Innova DX plastic.If Aerobie can offer this in a more durable plastic, I'd happily buy it again; but not in its current form. On a side note, it sometimes makes a cool whistling sound...not sure if that's a sign I threw it just right, or messed up...interesting though."

103645,0,"There isn't a whole lot to say about this item, mostly because it just a pump.I use this pump for my 700cc road bike and 26inch hybrid bike... plus footballs and all that fun stuff too.PROS:+ Long house that swivels making it rather effortless to get the nozzle on the valve+ Two sided head means you don't have to switch any parts around to go from presta to schrader+ Pressure gauge is easy to read+ Sturdy base means it doesn't tip over as easily as some other (cheaper) pumps+ Nozzles seem well constructed, won't get torn up like my last pump (the rubber inside the nozzle got torn up from the presta valves)CONS:- The handle doesn't feel very solid but it seems sturdy- Pumping isn't particularly easy, I think a $20 Schwinn pump I picked up at Target may have gotten me to 110 psi easier- It is relatively difficult to lock the nozzle on the valve,this might get easier as I use it more- I'm not a huge fan of the looks of it.. but it is just a pumpI've only had the pump for a week or so now, and I'll update this review if I have any problems or if my opinion of it changes.--UPDATE 6/30/2011--I don't like this pump much at all anymore. It is too hard to pump above 90 psi... especially when my cheaper floor pump from department store never gave me problems like this. I thought Topeak made some great products, and they might, just this isn't one of them. If you require PSI over 100... or would rather make your workout be on your bike instead of putting air into it, I'd suggest getting a more expensive model from your LBS or Amazon... something that will get up to 160 or so."
45295,2,"How many parts would you think there could be for this kit? Obviously the base, rim, backboard and pole will be separate. Break the pole into sections, throw in some bolts and we'll have 20 or 30 pieces? Actually, for this kit the number is over 100! And it's more than just the sheer number of parts; there clearly has been no effort made to control the complexity of this inventory, with many of the pieces similar yet slightly different, e.g., there are lots of slightly different sized washers and spacers. Don't think that because you've assembled Ikea kits with lots of identical screws that you are then prepared for this endeavor -- this is absolutely a whole different ball game.The comparison with Ikea is also instructive when looking at the directions. Ikea typically asks you to do just one thing for each image, with a level of detail that makes it very obvious from the moment you see the sheet what you need to do. Well, if Spalding had applied a similar approach to this kit, the instructions would be > 100 pages long. So instead we get in some cases exploded schematics that require you to stop and study, particularly since there are multiple instances where the image shows different parts than what actually ships with the kit you just bought. This would be no big deal if you weren't sifting through a mountain of parts trying to identify the part in your hand, making what ought to be trivial inaccuracies into something more aggravating.Spalding has pushed every bit of work out of the factory to you. And I mean it when I use the word 'every': there literally is not a single instance of multiple parts pre-connected in the box.The 38-page instruction book contains a complete list of parts with no images, and then several separate pages listing the parts with images, but listed out of order. Since the parts themselves are not in any way labeled, you will be very frequently thumbing through the image section, trying to determine, e.g., which is the #36 bolt? If you ignore my disapproval and decide to buy this mess anyway, it will save you a lot of time to break out all the parts up front and then place them on paper which you mark to indicate what is what. If you have all the parts so displayed, you can determine their identity by comparing relative size and numbers of parts with the instruction manifest.Don't think testing to see if parts fit nicely together can tell you if you're on the right track; the tolerances applied to the manufacture of these parts are very loose, leading to a rickety feel for the subassemblies even if you do a correct job. The instructions repeatedly warn against over tightening, which I'm sure is very common as consumers fruitlessly strip their screws trying to get to a tight product which I believe, given the poor quality of kit, is not possible in this case.It's interesting to see the generally positive tenor of the other reviewers -- I don't think I'm a particularly cranky person, but I was definitely annoyed by the time I was done with this trek through the assembly desert. Those guys are troopers!Anyway, I don't want to write a book here -- the bottom line is that if you value your time at more than 13 cents per hour, look elsewhere."

404079,1,"My 15 year old son loves these socks for hiking & backpacking with his Boy Scout troop. I bought him a few of the 'pro quarter length' socks in July 2011 & he's still wearing them!But he needed more for an extended backpacking trip. He goes through socks like there's no tomorrow, usually putting holes in the toes in no time or wearing them through so you can practically see through them - not to mention the stains. As I said, I bought him some a year ago...and he's still using them! Not on an every day basis, but enough so that they should have been in throw-away condition by now! These look nearly new, very little wear showing. There's very little wear or staining on them, which is amazing for normal wear, let alone backpacking.He says they are the most comfortable socks he's ever had, & he's never had to use a liner with them. He went on a rough, week long backpacking trip to Philmont with his Boy Scout troop last summer. He was told he needed to definately wear liner socks to protect his feet from the rough terrain - he didn't, and he did not have a single blister on the entire trip! In fact, he was always getting blisters & hot spots until he began wearing these socks! My husband & both sons have worn these socks during Boy Scout camp, which consisist of a week walking up & down 'suicide hill' several times a day. Since we got these socks for them, none have had anymore problems with their feet.......Oh, and did I forget to mention that my backpacking son wears a size 14 shoe? And his brother wears a size 13. Finding socks like this that will fit either of them are nearly impossible & very expensive - so I'm even more pleased with these because of that!"

Both guns are small and plastic, and they break pretty easily. My first one broke within the first 3 weeks, the second lasted about a year.So I would recommend these to kids that want an airsoft gun, but don't get these if you're looking for something serious."
289523,0,Good and bad for this jacket. First the price is to much. I paid $74.00 but it should have been lower because there is nothing to this jacket. It feels like your wearing a piece of plastic lined with netting. Yes it is waterproof but you better be wearing a flannel shirt underneath or you will freeze.The other good thing i can say about this jacket is the size was perfect. The sleeves are long enough for me as I am 5'8 and it is hard to find a jacket with sleeves long enough.

117531,0,"This bike is not much more than a cute bike.It's very heavy, does not have gears and the coasting breaks make it hard to stop given its inertia.However, if you buy it (as I did), just to move around the neighborhood to take some fresh air on weekends it is almost perfect. The heavier, the more exercise you make and the more air you intake!! Is sturdy enough, so you feel it's not going to break down when jumping down the curb, or riding on a park or a beach. The chair has springs, so your h..nie does not suffer.The assembly is not easy though, so be aware of it, and as a recommendation to the manufacturer I would say that the fenders are badly designed for a bike that is to be home-assembled, because if the assembly is not properly done they are going to scratch the wheels."

53004,0,"I was only able to rate this light as ""OK."" It does have some nice features such as the many LED combinations and the Xenon spot/flood light. Having the removable rear battery pack is also bonus for additional burn time which you will definitely need if you use the Xenon beam for extended periods. I was looking for such a combination of LED for long burn time and Xenon for a long throw main light and this light seemed to fit the bill, at least on paper.The reason that I can't give it a higher rating is due to it's very cheap construction. It is made out of a low grade molded plastic. As I put my first set of AAA in the main light area I pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I would be holding the unit together with tape after only a couple more battery changes. The two sides of the main unit are held together by only a small bump of plastic that will be worn down completely after a few more openings. Actually, tape might not be such a bad idea as this unit has no weatherproofing at all. I would highly recommend wearing it in wet conditions only under a brim of a waterproof hat. Another small picky point are the light combinations and positions. The single, and generally useless, Amber LED is in the middle below the Xenon spot. 2 red LEDs are L/R bottom and 2 white LEDs on L/R top. I would have preferred that the Red and white LEDs be flipped. Pushing the on/off button toggles through the following lights or combinations: Amber, Red, White, Red&White;, Xenon, Xenon&Red; and then off. When I'm hiking in the dark I would prefer to have the white LED lights point down to cover my immediate foot placement while the Xenon lights up the path further away. As it is now, I have this eerie red glow for my foot placement when the red LEDs are used with the Xenon. It is difficult to get a good depth of field with red which has led to more that a few slips. I think this red/xenon combination is a result of a designer really overthinking that the red LED would preserve your night vision when looking at your foot placement while still being able to see outward with the long throw of the Xenon. Maybe that works in theory but I look and feel like a alien with glowing red eyes stumbling through the woods at night. I would also replace the amber light with a third white LED. You already have the red LEDs to preserve your night vision. Anyway, I'm not altogether unsatisfied with this unit. It's just with a $30 price tag, I was expecting more.UPDATE: I modified the circuit board recently and I'm much happier with the light. I removed the amber and red LEDs from the board. I soldered one of the red LEDs in the center slot previously occupied by the amber LED. I purchased some high intensity white LEDs and soldered them in the bottom left/right slots. I now have my preferred colors in my preferred lighting sequence."

I know wasn't buying a Rolex but I did expect it to last at least a few months or gasp, at least 1 year! 6 months on the dot, the bezel falls off. We didn't even notice until later as it wasn't dropped or bumped against anything, it just fell off. Shoddy manufacturing I guess. As usual I guess for these types of companies, nothing is actually covered under the warranty so the bezel will need to fixed at an extra charge, in addition to the shipping and handling fees, which come out of the customer's pocket. All in all, it will require 50% of the purchase price just to get this fixed as the warranty does not cover anything. Stay away from Invicta watches, you're better off buying a 10$ Timex from your corner store. Heck, you're better off buying with a dollar store watch in terms of value for the money!"

314935,1,"We bought this for our daughter's second birthday. After reading many reviews and testing them out at the store we decided on this bike. My daughter is and was shorter for her age, so we almost got a more compant bike, but decided that she wouldn't out grow this one as fast. We also thought the handle bar would be great to help her out as she learned to ride it. Now she is 3 and still has a hard time reaching the pedals when she is turning. We, use the handle for out walks still and she loves to steer, but when she starts to get tired we lock the front wheel and she sits back and enjoys the ride.

457902,1,"I have seen a mixed bag of reviews about this paddle on Amazon, and I agree with most of them. True the paddle is wicked fast, and true it's one of the spinniest paddles I have played for $50. Also true (the downside to being so sticky) is that it picks up every piece of lint; from clothes, to floors, heck, even stuff from the ball! Also true, the rubber is delicate, I wash mine after each play, and it still has frayed some around the edges where my fingers reach. BUT, on the plus side, I can usually count on 60% of my chops getting returned into the net, and my loops are off the charts! So, good with the bad, this one is what I expected when I bought a 100 speed, 100 spin, 85 control paddle...not a garage hard blade."

107624,0,"This bag works for my purposes, nice quality construction, good design. I have one complaint, the end section that holds a ball is a bit small. It takes a good bit of work to get a ball into it. It is the Jr model, so maybe it is designed for a ball smaller than regulation.Otherwise it is OK."
57998,0,"I bought this cot and am taking it back b/c I will be camping with just my daughter and I apparently don't have the muscle to attach the head and foot bars. My husband and I together couldn't do it while setting it up in the living room. It was comfortable and large enough for my daugter and myself (she sleeps practically on me), so that would have been great. It was very heavy and awkward to unfold."

443119,0,"Although these boots are correctly sized and waterproof, they are floppy. This means unlike higher quality boots, you can't just step into them, but must hold them open to put them on. I got them for my husband to put on when popping outside as he always slips on his work shoes (fastest to put on) and they get muddy. Given these are not easy-on I think he will still put his slip-on work shoes on and not use these. If you're looking for inexpensive rubber boots these still make work fine for you."

112474,1,"This belt is well-made, soft, and will immediately hold a knot. Rather than having your student walk around with the belt sticking out at all odd angles until he or she breaks it in, this belt is good to go and can handle future beatings. It is an excellent deal."
130147,0,"I'm 5'4"" tall and weigh 135#. The weights were way too big for me & slipped off the lower legs & on to the heels. Couldn't make them any tighter. The outside construction is good. However the weight inserts are verly flimsily covered & poorly sewn & very difficult to re insert. I would be afraid that they would split open after a few handlings. If you larger than I & wouldn't want to remove the weights then it's fine. For me it wouldn't work. I have seen other products with insert bags that are sewn much better & out of stronger material. Unfortunately it's not that easy finding 20# ankle weights."

Despite extremely patient, world-class instruction, i'm hopeless on the ground and a REALLY slow learner. Neede something equivalent to ""grappling for dummies""....too many DVD resources are pitched way above entry level novice and assume significant prior knowledge/ experience.

440787,2,I bought a Century heavyweight gi a few years and it was better quality than this one. My old one is a size 5 and I lost a lot of weight. I am now 5:6 and 155 pounds. The 5 is a tent and the 4 is way too tight. I sent the two size fours that I ordered back. BlackBeltShop was great to deal with. They didn't charge me the re-stocking fee that was part of the original agreement.5 stars for BlackBeltShop but only 2 for Century for this mediocre quality dogi.I bought a Tokaido on eBay for $115. It is the difference between a Rolls and a Ford Maverick.
496524,2,"I bought this seat to replace the terrible one that came with my Schwinn Active-10 Series exercise bike. If that seat rates a 1 on the hardness scale (with 1 being the hardest and 10 the softest), this pillow top seat is at best a 2. After just 25 minutes, my rear is just as sore as with the previous seat. I sit all day, and I'm trying to get exercise for once in my life, but these terrible bike seats don't make it easy to do that. Why must all bike seats be hard as a rock? I'm very disappointed and will look to other brands in the future."
170337,0,"When I have a couple of friends over, we always bust out NFL street. You can pick teams like you would at recess at school but with NFL players. The same players play on offense and defense so you could choose all defensive players and rock them on defense, unfortunately you won't get very far on offense.Graphics are decent. It's nothing to complain about but nothing to freak out over either. All of the players are oversized to give the game a NFL Blitz kind of feel (but I think it's better than blitz)Sound is kind of bad. The players yell ghettoish insults at eachother that are really dumb ie ""You're gonna do my laundry!"" They don't do it often but I always crack up at how corny it is when I hear it.Challenge is pretty difficult but don't give up! The idea is that you start from scratch with blank players (0 points in everything) and earn points through challenges so they can become good. I do the fantasy team and use all of my points on two or three players (make sure I get a QB and Wideout). Then I can start stealing players from other teams when I beat them.This is a good game to play with friends and you can get some fun out of it playing by yourself too, and it's only like 20 dollars now."
455010,1,"Worked first time after I wore the chest strap with Spectra 360 Electrode Gel. I have had it for a month. Monitors the heart rate really well. Don't have any problem so far. I use the watch by itself more often. Essentially, it is a good basic heart rate monitor. Doesn't have fancy stuff you can get with Garmin HRM's, like GPS functions. All actions are done by pressing the buttons. No touch type actions, which don't work some time. Very easy to replace battery in the chest strap. Also, it is not that hard to replace the battery in the monitor (watch), if you are a bit handy type of person. On the negative side, the monitor (sports watch) is not that good looking. A bit harder to see the display in sun, and low light conditions, compared to my old Casio watch. All in all, I think, I made a very good decision to buy this product."
27415,0,"For the price these were good converse that lasted a little over a year and a half (I wore them a lot). The one thing I noticed is that when they arrived they smelled like spray paint and over time as the black faded it started to look like a dark green. Not that bad, but something to take into consideration."
48738,1,"This was ridiculously easy to assemble, its a snug fit, it needs to be to hold together. Also very effective excersize, i would recommend it. If you are prone to a bad lower back, BE VERY CAREFUL TO READ THE DIRECTIONS!"
186232,0,This works about as advertised but there is a tolerance problem. The hole that the seat post goes through is designed too small. First you have to figure out a way to pry this open a small amount. This isn't very easy since it isn't designed to bend much. Took a while to do this but then it seems to work reasonably well.
97926,1,"I have had this model of watch for over 10+years. I initally bought it for scuba diving, which it worked great at. It then survived multiple years in the military with no problems and working great. I actually bought two of them, and am now getting another as back up, just in case casio stops making them. Its not too big, like many of the Gshock ones, like wearing a hockey puck on your wrist. All the extra functions work great and the dial face is tough! My main one is all scratched up, but stil going strong. When you get this, not if!, make sure you get several extra straps sometime, as you will go through many of them before the watch ever dies. The only thing I guess is a minor concern is that when replacing the battery, they usually say they cannot guarentee the water reisitance after they open it, but I never have had an issue.So do you, and everyone you know a favor, and get this watch! You'll never have to get another one again."
403965,1,"Not quite sure about the chinese watch comment. Looks pretty good to me! Nice weight to it as well. Not too heavy, not too light. The detail in this watch is fabulous. Highly recommended."

426511,1,"On this DVD, master instructor Cathe Friedrich offers two workouts from her Body Blast series: Kick, Punch & Crunch (KPC), a cardio kickboxing workout, and Legs & Glutes (L&G;), a lower body focused strength training workout. Both workouts are excellent, but what really makes this DVD so valuable is the wide variety of customization options as described below.I previously owned an edited, FitTV version of KPC on VHS, but I had no idea how much I was missing by not having the full workout. KPC is a 68-minute workout that combines intense kickboxing drills with choreographed kickboxing combinations and a great abs segment. The 7-minute warm-up introduces all of the punches and kicks used in the workout and gradually picks up the pace. Next comes 7 minutes of fun, intermediate intensity drills before moving on to another 18 minutes or so of high intensity drills (including some high impact work). After a brief cool-down, Cathe starts the first of three kickboxing combinations, all of which combine punches and kicks (21 minutes total). Finally, there is a 7-minute abs section using a stability ball and a nice 5-minute cool-down. This workout is an intense high intermediate/low advanced level, although knowledgeable exercises could modify down (no modifications are shown).Legs & Glutes is a 51 minute lower body routine. Unlike many of Cathe's workouts, it does not use a barbell, so you can get by with more minimal equipment: dumbbells, a high step (or sturdy bench), and an optional stick for balance. After a 3 1/2 minute traditional aerobic warm-up, Cathe moves into standing leg work including leg press, squats, lunges, plies, explosive (jumping) plies, drop squats, 1-legged dead lifts, plie squats, and explosive lunges. At about the 25 minute mark, she adds ankle weights for addition standing exercises such squats with side leg abduction, calf work, standing quad work, and abductor work. Moving to the floor, Cathe continues for an additional 11 minutes, first working the hamstrings with pelvic tucks and leg lifts on all fours, then targeting the outer and inner thighs from a side-lying position. This workout finishes with a nice 5-minute stretch focused on the lower body.As mentioned above, the best thing about this DVD is the wide variety of custom options. The menus for both KPC and L&G; including options for playing the entire workout, viewing the chapter selections, and mixing and matching chapters. In addition, each workout offers ""Quick Select Premixes"" which provide both shorter and longer workout options. For KPC, there are 7 premixes ranging in length from 27-53 minutes, and for L&G;, there are 6 premixes ranging from 11-79 minutes and including all standing/all floor options. There are also an additional 7 premixes which combine segments from the two workouts; these run from 37-53 minutes. Finally, there is a ""Workout Blender"" option which allows you to create your own custom workout by selecting chapters from either KPC or L&G.;If you are familiar with Cathe, you know that she often incorporates upbeat, recognizable music (selections here include ""Walking in Memphis,"" ""Band of Gold,"" and ""You Spin Me Round""). These are fun, energetic workouts which will provide you with endless variety and options--highly recommended!!!"
243251,0,Nice product. However the S&H costs were high and it took forever to receive shipment.
444857,0,"Rec'd package within a day of being shipped (nice!) but the DVD is MISSING!! Can't imagine how helpful the DVD would have been, however, I expect to receive product as advertised. The mat itself is ok...feels like really cheap vinyl. Not the same quality as the one used in Crossfit. Probably should have stuck to original plan of using a flat pillow and saved $35."
84920,0,"As stated, my left glove split after 2 years of training with it 2 times a week for 1 hour. I used them for a Krav Maga class and most of the use was pad striking drills and light grappling. If it was sparring or competition I would understand but I felt they should've lasted a little longer. Other than that, they were great! The bar under the fingers feels really comfortable for punching but gets in the way if you do palm strikes or any other open handed technique. Drying is a little tough since they don't have an open palm, and they do get a little hot during training."
206145,0,This bag works well for carrying and storing the stove but it is not too tough. Just transporting it two times to campsites left many holes in it. It's just not tough enough to handle the sharp edges found on all sides of the stove. I had to duct-tape much of the inside of the bag to handle the wear.

86756,0,"Here's the thing. I've ""had"" this knife for about 3 weeks, most of that time it was at SOG being repaired. The knife itself is strong and superb, exactly what you'd want from a knife like this. There is a bit of play side to side but nothing outrageous. However the pocket clip is crap; if you don't intend to use the pocket clip this is the knife for you. I day I get the knife I have it no more than 1 hour and I'm removing the screw to swap the pocket clip to the other side and the screw breaks. I e-mail SOG and they say that it's highly unusual for that to happen and that I should mail it in so I mail it in and they had it for about 3 weeks including shipping there. I literally just got it back today and I put the knife in my back pocket I go to sit down and when I get up the knife falls out. ""Well that's odd."" The pocket clip got caught on something, arm back of the chair whatever and it bent to the point where it's unusable. Really? Really? Up til now I've used cheapo knives I got at gun shows and I told myself I needed a high dollar knife because everyone had repeated the old adage to me ""You get what you pay for."" Well all the cheap knifes I carry daily have never had the pocket clip bend on any of them ever. If this is indicative of the quality of their knives I will not be buying another SOG knife. Sorry Gunny. I'm debating on returning this knife."
464109,2,"Purchased at local store and will be returning at local store.Opened the package and had to set up the pump for my street bike stems. Not too bad. Went to use the pump and it was having a hard time staying sealed unless I was very careful not to move it while pumping. Not a huge issue but a little irritating when trying to undo the stem it would let out about 5-10 psi.My main concern, was that while pumping, the handle repeatedly pinched middle finger skin and almost caused a blood blister. I had to then be incredibly cautious while pumping my tires. This seems to be an obvious design flaw that was not fixed for some reason and I would highly recommend buying a different pump (if you like the skin to stay on your fingers).For those of you having a hard time imagining what I am talking about... The top of the pump rotates outwards to fit into your hand as shown in the picture. Underneath the handle it has a very sharp plastic edge that butts next to the pipe. Your fingers easily get caught in this crevice and it probably wont take a rocket scientist to realize sharp plastic + metal rod + handle that isn't very stable = blood blisters and skin loss after too much use.In the end it worked ""ok"" but by all means was not worth working around every day or weekly."
366614,0,"It's just a short. Quite mediocre in quality, hence the 3 stars. I didn't have high expectations for this short since I was trying to meet a minimum total for an offer and I would only use it to lounge in. The material is a bit more rough than expected. And the red is much brighter than in the pictures. The only major issue I may see for others is the discomfort that may be caused by chafing by the inner elastic band."
197662,1,i bought this for my husband as a surprise xmas present. he was not expecting a razor scooter but since i bought the same thing for my kids i thought it'd be funny. it was funny but it has also been great fun! scooters are not hard to ride and it's a great way to be active with the kids. good family fun.

414120,0,"The merchant Together-Bottle is NOT selling the New Wave Enviro bottle. It is an equivalent bottle, one that I have been satisfied with.The bottle I received is a 1837ml/40 oz ECOtanka bottle. The bottle is virtually identical, sharing the same attributes as the New Wave Enviro: .6mm wall 304-grade SS and a SS cap.The merchant was very understanding when I contacted them and expressed my concern that the product received was not the one that I had ordered. They said that they have a 100% return policy and they would even pay shipping for the return. I asked if I could try the bottles as I really didn't want to hassle with the return and the details for how long from the purchase date I could return them. They again emphasized a 100% return policy no strings attached.I have had the bottle for a week now and am very satisfied with it, I find it to be of equal quality to the New Wave Enviro bottle that I already have, but at a much cheaper price.I'm rating this three stars simply because the listing is misleading.The bottle and customer services from Together-Bottle are A+. Would buy again."
175421,1,"I know you are questioning yourself right about now on investing your hard earned dollars purchacing this transfer gas can.I sure did and after I used it I was glad that I got it.I laied it down on the tailgate of my pick-up,filled it full of very expensive gasoline,and stood it up, straped it down and headed off for a weekend of riding.The gravity flowed the gas smoothly into the bikes tanks and the hose was more than long enough to reach them.I even tried squeezing the pump trigger to see how it worked and it wasn't too bad either.Took less room in the pick-up bed with 14 gallons standing upright."
102080,0,"Well, I was attracted to this racket primarily because of such a good feedback from other people. One of my tennis friends bought the racket ahead of me. So I could try it a couple of times. Initially the racket felt so good to me.That is why I bought it. For some reason, the feeling was gone after I used the racket for a few weeks.The biggest weakness was power. A more serious problem was the little cushion, which I suspect caused me the first tennis elbow in 15 years. My friend told me that the very same thing happened to him. Both of us ended up reselling our racket to other people at about a half price of the original purchase price. Sadly I had to return to my more than 10-years-old Wilson Profile. I played tennis for more than 15 years, and I am an advanced player. I would like to advise you to try the racket for weeks before buying this racket. I would like to rate it at lower than three stars. But I don't want to look too harsh. Hope you may read between the lines."

The only minor plus side to it is that you have the option to clip it to your bag."

366352,1,"If you are the kind of camper who has always considered your old, straight-walled 8X10 to be ""pretty large"", get one of these. It's more like a hotel room than anything else. If your party is four or less, you'll find room for everybody and all your gear.You'll also find a tent that's easy to set up. Really. Even the first time. I set it up myself in about 30-35 minutes, including time to figure everything out. With all the numerous, large windows and doors open, it's like having the outside in. In warmer weather, the view of the trees and night sky above is a treat. In colder or wet weather, with the rain fly on and windows adjusted for conditions, it's snug and dry. The ventilation is amazing.There are convenient and effective storage spaces. There are two large ""D"" doors, and right by them, two zippered small ""doors"" for power cables, SatRadio antennas or whatever. You can divide the interior in two, sort of. The divider hangs loosely, but probably will not be used by most people anyway.This tent's first trip was to Mammoth Lakes' New Shady Rest Campground. Except for the occassional light traffic noise and the booming voice of the High School Friday Night Football's announcer next door, it's like being in the deep woods miles from anything. For a few minutes, we wondered if LA's Pershing Square, with it's expounders, had gone camping. The wilderness with McDonald's a ten minute walk away. Pretty nice. The camp host, Dave, stands up there with the very best, too. If you're there next year, and he's there, you won't be disappointed. Most of Mammoth is the same way.Our party of three went away for 4 nights. There was one of those fierce Eastern Sierra Fall Windstorms before I got back, but the tent showed no signs of stress or strain. No guy-outs even. Things left on the table outside were blown around, but the Eureka had no problem. Not to worry with Dave on duty, though. He had my cell number, and said, true to his word, he would call if anything adverse happened.And this tent is nice to look at, too. With the dappled sunlight coming through the copper and creme-colored panels, it's downright pleasant. The Eureka designers and engineers really did their work well with the Copper Canyon series. A Home Run.Nearly any camper, experienced or not, should like this one."
14430,0,"This mat is large, but not quite as cushiony as I expected. It must be rolled up after each use. Folding it over, even once, will leave a crease that compromises the cushion. Also, small nicks and tears occur easily due to the type of material of which it is made. It is large enough to accommodate my 6' 2"" height and allows my entire body, from head to toe, to remain on the mat when exercising. It was a bit pricy at $72, including more than $12 S&H. Because it is so delicate, vis-a-vis nicks, I might not purchase it again - if I could find another one this size that is made of a material a bit more durable."

Gun has a decent fire rate and pretty nice accuracy at 10 meters, I super glued the springs in the stock so now it's pretty solid, comes with a single 30 round mag, I'd recommend buying more for it, especially since they can clip together, the red dot is adjustable but Not worth the effort in my opinion, the iron sights are great for the gun and also adjustable, I'd recommend not using the mock suppressor because it seems to make your shots go wild, also the thing is really light compared to the real thing, so don't expect an 8 pound rifle to come in the mail."
225273,0,"This is a nice little gun safe. Please, note that I use the word ""little"" - if you are considering this safe, keep a few things in mind. Although the measurements are 10"" x 3.5"" x 7.5"" the interior is quite a bit smaller - the back of the keypad is open on the interior. It has to be - you must be able to replace the battery and change your code. We ordered four HOMAK safes and I have yet to be able to find the ""button"" to change the codes. The door opening is 7.25"" X 4.75"" - so be sure your pistol will fit easily through that opening. Look at the picture and see how your pistol will have to be placed in the safe and judge if that size opening is large enough. We had one pistol small enough to work. The other three HOMAK safes we ordered were the larger 10"" deep size. The larger sizes make it possible for us to insert pistols to lay flat on the bottom of the safe. With this safe the pistol leans on the back of the safe - the 3.5"" they mention in the description is the deepest area of the outside of the safe. If you consider the thickness of the door and the metal of the safe, you diminish the interior depth. As I said in the beginning - this is a nice ""lttle"" safe."
72014,2,"Follow up: I now own 3 of them and all 3 have some burned out LEDsI was surprized at how well built this flashlight is. The frequency of UV light is perfect for detecting leaks in cooling systems for both automotive and residential applications. It also works well for amature forensic purposes, and scorpions will appear luminescent. The xenon bulb is very nice but not the brightest light you can find and you have to depress the switch three times to use the xenon bulb. I am very pleased with my purchase, but it is overpriced. If you are not buying this light mostly for the UV purposes then you probably want something else. UPDATE: I have had it for over a year now and one of the Led lights on the module is burned out, keep this in mind when buying."
84312,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed. Thank you ladies, for your review comments, as I rely on these to make my purchases."
383760,1,"I was so excited to start using my sauna suit I couldn't wait. I lost water of 2 lbs in 2wks after for wears. Love this suit!I have one observation...the more sweat/liquid in the suit the more it leaks, liquid thens to dip from the wrist area. I recommend wearing T-shirt to help absorb some of the sweat."
507909,0,"My daughter rode the Kettler balance bike (that'sthe small one with no pedals) from age 3 to 4. Thenat age 4 she was ready for this bike, ""ready"" in therespect that she could sit on the bike with the saddleat its lowest setting, with both her feet planted onthe floor. We didn't need to bother at all with thetraining wheels, we just took her to a gently slopingpath in the local park and off she went. But the bikeis very heavy and whenever we ride to the park (about1 mile each way) she will choose her balance bike overthe Bingo bike every time - she can go much faster on it,and lift it up curbs and turn it around 180 degreesunderneath her, all without having to get off - none ofthis is possible with the heavier Bingo. So in summary,the Bingo bike did it's job in that it taught her how toride a bike, but that's it. The build quality is solid.One minor gripe: the saddle angle is not adjustable, andmy daughter found herself slipping forwards on it, andwe ended up buying an adjustable-tilt saddle directlyfrom Kettler."
345052,0,"I bought several pairs because they were cheap and I just needed some shorts for the gym. I bought grey, black, navy, and green. The colors are pretty much accurate to the pictures.The material is thin, but I prefer something light-weight for working out. The elastic band doesn't bother me at all.I will say they are SHORT and SMALL. I generally wear a small and I ordered large for these (though a medium probably would have worked too). And they are very short - as in ""be careful when you're stretching"" short. I tend to wear them around the house all the time though since they're super comfortable."
358220,0,"I won't rant and rave about how we need the NFL to grant competition between companies again, but I will say that people need to stop buying this game and then complaining about how bad it sucks year in and year out. So, now that I've said that, onward with the review.Plain and simple, this game is fun. If you're a big football fan, and you need your video game version of a NFL fix, well, then you must buy this game.PROS:Running the ball is actually difficult in this game. You really have to work throughout the entire game before you are rewarded with that big run in the end.The weapon system is also a nice touch, and really adds to the depth of the game.Passing the ball and getting rid of it in time are also realistic for a change. You don't have 5 to 10 seconds to throw anymore. Depending on how good your O-line is on pass protection you'll have a good 2-3 seconds in the pocket before you need to make your mind up.I also really like the new control scheme. I really hated it at first, but after a few hours, I came to appreciate it. Your jukes, cuts, and bull dozing forward are all done with your right control stick. Your sprinting is done with the right trigger. Stiff arms are done with just the press of one button instead of trying to figure out at the last second which trigger to push.The preplay snap controls take a lot of learning, but once you get them down, you can shut the annoying menu off that so many people have grown to hate. They work great, too, and it's easy to tweek your defense before the snap. The only thing that makes the preplay snap controls a likely con as well, is that there is a HIGH learning curve for them.Oh, and all those wonderful features that come year in and year out. No more mini-camp though. :( (I haven't owned a copy of Madden since 05 ... well the PC version of 07, too, but does that really count?)CONS:Right away the menu system actually confused me. It took me a couple minutes to realize I had to press start to bring up the main menu, because I was staring at the vast hallway thing on the startup screen wondering ""where's the menu?"". So, I'm probably dumb. However, after that, I got used to how the menu system works, and I didn't really care after that. Still, though, a mild annoyance.The announcing, er radio announcing ... yeah it's that bad. I had to shut it off. My wife said she could do better announcing than that. Ooooh, BURN!The graphics .... ""GRAPHICS?!"" you say? Yeah, it's a con, and I'll tell you why. The players look TOO shiny. They don't get roughed up or messed up as the game goes on. They look the same they did coming out of the tunnel as they go back in it. Go through a game of All-Pro 2k8 and tell me what the players look like 1/4 of the way into it. Yeah, that's what I mean. The field looks great, but that's about it. The coaches are designed and move just badly. I've seen better animations done by Madden games in the past. What's with the step back here? Players on the side line are too generic for a next-gen console game. Once again, look at what APF2K8 has done with the side line ambiance, then look at Madden NFL 08. It's a pathetic comparison. There aren't too many player animations either, which 2K8 has also done better. My other little thing, is that there are less accessories on the players. No mouth pieces or tattoos. Other Madden games had this, so why did they remove that stuff? Seeing Larry Johnson run the football without his mouth piece on kind of erks me. Call me picky, but when you spend $400 on a next gen console, and another $60 (I rented this, so I only spent $5) you tend to get picky about the performance of your games.One game play thing that in my opinion has yet to be fixed with any Madden NFL game is how accurate the QBs are in this game. Yes, even Peyton Manning throws overthrows and underthrows in real life. So why does my second string quarterback with an overall rating of 75 throw passes dead on 100% of the time? Well, lets just say that I'm glad there's a way to modify the AI or I'd go crazy.Just a side note thing, but does anyone really care about User trophies and points? After the game is over, Marshal Faulk comes on and talks about how many more points I earned. I don't care! Can I just get back to playing football? What's with the silly rings on the side of the teams' names before each game? Can't I have a television style of commentary during the game instead of this hybrid EA/radio crap? I'll tell you what, EA. If you really don't want Madden in your game anymore, than go grab some competent announcers from, oh I don't know, ESPN! (since you kind of bought the license out for that for the next 15 years), and call your game EA Sports/ESPN NFL 09 for next year.Overall, this really is a good game. I haven't enjoyed any Madden football games since 05, but this one, 08, really is better. There are just a few minor annoyances that keep this game from being great. Is APF2k8 better? No, it's just different. That game has it's own annoying quirks as well. As far as Madden 08 goes, I think it just needs a little competition to push it over the envelope to make it a great game. Until then, here's Madden 08, which should provide you with a good solid year of fun."
250116,1,Glad you had it because Coleman discontinued and I couldn't find it anywhere. Will use it all winter to keep warm in the cart.
210530,0,"Bag showed up, and it is a large bag, the item seems to grow as I add stuff to it. The biggest drawback is the feet, I HATE the feet! I am almost certain they will bee torn off during use, and after reading other reviews i thought I would do some minor surgery when the bag arrived... this proved to be a bad idea, the feet are not screwed on they have rivets in them... I will just have to wait till they are torn off. Over all, the bag seems to be heavy enough, it does have that oh so new smell, but seems to fade quickly. Material seems to be heavy enough to withstand the rigors of use, the overall design of the bag is good, could use internal dividers, and stitching seems a little loose.Overall is it a good bag?? I feel yes, it is.. only time will tell... but those darn feet!!I would recommend this bag to others, just on price alone, but Don't be shocked by the little feet on the bottom... they could be a deal breaker!"
53809,1,"I've now owned this scope for 18 months and have used it in a variety of situations, mostly for birding. I've used it in high heat, bitter cold, rain and snow. I purchsed it after reading very good reviews from optics gurus on the internet.This Alpen ranks at the top of the mid-range scopes, and ranks higher than some scopes which cost hundreds of $$$ more. It doesn't have fancy glass, but the BAK 4 glass is fully multi-coated and gives clear and sharp images. For me the ""sweet spot"" is around 50X which is ample in most situations. But it still gives very decent views cranked all the way out at 60X, though the light drops off a little except on clear days.For anyone with $400. and who doesn't want to spend much more, there's probably no better scope on the market. It'll give years of use and comes with a lifetime warranty which even includes accidental breakage!"

As noted in other reviews, I wanted the shorter, wide-mouthed thermal jug for my dogs for agility training. Instead I received a tall, thinner jug with ""Igloo Legend"" on it. Not what I ordered TWICE!!! I ordered it for a Christmas present, ordered in plenty of time TWICE and still am without the gift. I would not recommend dealing with this company."

I hope never need it in an accident but the price totally worth it!"
382306,2,"My daughter bought this with her own money. We brought it home, filled it up and it was torn within the first 2 tosses.

251840,1,This is really a very good value for money. We got the kayak this weekend and we went kayaking in a neaby lake. It was pure enjoyment. The kayak is easy to inflate..takes 10-20 mins to inflate. The paddles are good and sturdy.Its excellent recreational accessory.We have used it just onnce and we were happy..Let's see how it perfoems in the long run. The only drwback is that its a bit bulky. But if you want it to be sturdy I guess 30 pounds is reasonable. This is highly recommended for beginners. You might like to switch to permanent one after using this for some years.
453555,2,"From the first time I purchased this, it has been wobbly and makes cranking noises when I go backwards. Now I have had it for a few months and the monitor always kicks off and it's not the batteries. The handles are loose and make an obnoxious noise and they will not tighten anymore than I have them. For the price you pay, this piece of equipment should really be a 100x better than it is. I don't have the original box because I was not expecting this to be junk and I didn't purchase the extended warranty so I'm stuck with this thing til it falls to the ground and I'm sure it will."
164786,0,"I like this lanyard well enough, but if I had it to do over again, I would go for something lighter and more flexible. Also for the record, the promotional materials say that this is a call lanyard ""with black mini duck ornament."" But it is not a mini duck ornament. It is a mini duck call ornament, which is a far different thing. Still, it seems silly to split hairs over lanyards. This one is functional, but so is a length of parachute cord. I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend."
103568,0,The pump is nice for the price but don't consider it if your want to pump up your roadbike tires above 100psi. I'm 165 lbs and my feet come off the ground just to get it up to 115 psi. For my mountain bike it works just fine to 80 psi.

325970,1,"I highly recommend these gloves. I put 2400 miles on these gloves in 7 days, when they were brand new and had never been worn. The build quality was good and the gloves still look like new after my trip. I ordered extra large size for my extra large hands. They're easy to get on and off, and yet still give me a perfect feel for the Electra Glide's handle bars. The fit was great, the ventilation was great, and I felt the skid protection was exactly at the level I expected from fingerless gloves. They have plenty of leather right where I need it, it the palm, and not too much between the fingers etc. where it would get in the way. The mesh top is nice and thick, had no issues with fraying etc., and probably would provide at least some protection in a road-rash situation. The colors went very well with my black & silver Tour Master jacket."

378553,1,"Face it. For every hour you ride you'll encounter at least one driver who just doesn't see you. Bicyclists need a loud horn. And the air horn is loud - really loud! (The volume is adjustable - but I keep mine at the loudest.) The air horn is also really light. So it doesn't add weight to your ride. Finally, I really like that to ""recharge"" it all you need is a bicycle pump. Mine arrived quickly, (two days?) and in good shape. I recommend this vendor and I very strongly recommend this product. It will save your life! By the way, writing reviews is a pain in the butt. I don't normally do it."
165235,2,"This cover seems pretty dodgy quality wise, it dosn't shut solidly , if you look around the edges the bottom is flush but the sides are bulging open (on or off the scope). Secondly if you manage to get it to close it stays shut temporarily but the slightest bump or pressure and it pops open (i.e. useless for hunting). Pretty nasty and am dissapointed as the Butler Creek eyepiece covers work fine."

46507,1,I have only used this once so far but its is made out of quality material. Although as i read in previous reviews before buying you definatley need to secure the front wheel and the pedal to the bike rack or it will definatley do a number on your bumper. Also where the hooks attatch to the backside of the trunk lid and in my case the bottom of the trunk lid I think is missing a key peice of foam. You never want to attatch a peice of metal against the paint it will crack it in no time. I cut out 3 peices of foam and glued them to the hooks to prevent any damage. But over all I am pretty satisfied with the bike rack.

I tried to contact Golf Gifts & Gallery, to see about ordering replacement wheels, in case these break. They referred me back to Amazon, and stated that they (Amazon)are responsible for the product now (Poor customer service). I would not recommend the purchase of this product."

490133,0,I purchased this holster for a Taurus PT99AF. It took considerable force to insert the gun into the holster and it was extremely difficult to remove. Impossible for a one handed draw. The holster is riveted and has no tension adjustments. The literature with the holster stated to not adjust or modify the holster in anyway and to return it if the gun does not fit. I am returning it.I do want to note that both Nidacast and Fobus were easy to work with on the problem and with the product return.
448181,0,"This lock, despite being made by the reputable Kryptonite, feels flimsy. It isn't quite long enough for a lot of bike racks.

95750,1,"For those of you who have not purchased or used a Benchmade knife before, now is the time. I chose Benchmade after a number of friends, hunters, and sportsman (including staff at outdoor shops) recommended the brand. I personally went with the 940 Osborne because of its size and functionality. It's small enough to carry around with you every day, yet large enough to accomplish most tasks that you need a knife for. Well worth the investment...and it truly is an investment as this is a knife that I plan on having for many, many years."
504702,0,"Functionally it is a ok or good product for the money. The only downside is the thickness and size. It is bulky and too thick so that it is not much convenient practically.

It is a nice size, and can hold 4 days worth of food for 2, which means you spend more time on vacation, and less in the supermarket. The handle & wheels are nice, and seemed like it could handle decent usage. As others have said, do make sure you drain the water periodically, so as to avoid additional strain when moving the cooler. The one feature it is missing is a shelf to keep things like cold cuts, that cant get wet, out of the water. However, tupperware can also serve this purpose--just not as convienently as a removable shelf would have.Now to the negatives. First, I understand when they do these tests they have ""optimal"" conditions. They leave the cooler in the shade, they dont open it at all (this is a big one) and they put one giagantic block of ice in there, with no food and as one solid mass. All these things enable it to stay ice longer, so at the end of 5 days they can say it keeps ice for 5 days.That said, even taking those conditions into account, I am not sure how they got ice to last 5 days in this. We were camping in September, and the temprature ranged from 40-85, with it only being 85 one day, we were also camping in the deep shade. We had pretty solid 50% ice meltage every day. We were also 2 adults, so we weren't contantly opening the cooler for sodas and things like kids would have. Also, the way we store meat is to freeze it in tupperware in our freezer at home, and put it in the bottom of the cooler; thus, some of the food is actually acting as additional ice. Now, I do want to say that we had 4 days of meat in there, had no spoilage, and the meat didn't defrost until we wanted it to--but, we did have to add ice every day. Not a huge thing, but it would have been better if we could have gone at least 2 days."

Not so thin that I think it might break if you got caught on something but so thin that if it were to be wrapped on your neck I could see where it might be irritating. The second concern is the springs that hold the calls in the loop. They do not seem to be very strong so while they work I am wondering if in the field it might be possible that a call could come loose. With two calls as this model is, I do not think that thinness of the cord is that big a deal but I also bought the 4 call model and can see that cord really digging in from the added weight and also when it slides around when you go from one call to another."

122252,0,Honestly this petal sounds pretty bad. It sucks a lot of tone from the guitar. It has potential for leads though. You get a lot of clarity from this thing when you solo really fast. It just has no tone.Get a dunlop mxr fullbore metal. It sounds way better for rythm guitar. Just not so good for leads though.It would be great of they came out with a petal that combined MT-2's fast action with mxr fullbore's excellent tone. It would make for one hell of a metal pedal.
32284,2,"The bike arrived in great shape. Assembly went okay, and it looked pretty good and got approving comments on its looks. The parts seemed sufficiently solid at first. But the coaster brake was slow, and after a few hours of riding, over a couple of weeks, the bottom bracket assembly started falling apart. I tried putting it back together, but the thread was completely worn. Luckily I was able to return it. With a decent bottom bracket this bike would easily get four stars, but alas . . . ."

101191,0,"I'd like to first point out that I've put these to work in a situation that they probably weren't designed for, but hey. It's still use.These are obviously intended to be a shooting/tactical type glove. I do not train/be in tactical situations where this glove would sport its intended purpose. I used this glove HARD for heavy duty trail work with both hand and power tools. This will be a review based on what a general glove should be, and how I think these held up to those standards.First flaw I found was actually on the product listing - why is there no medium size listed? At first I thought they didn't make the size but as the gloves came I saw &#34;M&#34; clearly printed on the list of available sizes. These were a little bit too big for me and contributed to the wear because of that.Gloves came with very good construction. All stitching was very tough and didn't seem likely to break any time soon. The synthetic leather on the palm was also very soft and comfortable while retaining a good level of dexterity. The grip &#34;pads&#34; on the palm ensured a non-slip grip on anything you would put your hands on. So far, so good.Turn the glove over and you will find a pretty thick neoprene back. This was hot. Too hot for a work glove, and definitely for a tactical glove. Of course, I'm in SoCal so I may have a biased opinion, and these are marketed as &#34;all-weather&#34; anyway. The velcro closure could have been designed a little bit better, with a larger contact surface area and a straight piece of rectangular velcro instead of stupid ball shaped designs that don't really do anything.I'm willing to forgive the hotness of the neoprene back, since the rest of the glove looked so promising. The only other flaw I found was the fingertips were square shaped instead of rounded like and actual finger. I think the gloves would have fit substantially better with rounded tips.I, being the excited person who just got a new thing to try out, slapped on these babies to try them out on the trail.I have to say, not bad for the first couple of days. There was practically no damage to any part of the glove, and it helped me deal with impacts and absorbed some of the force. I was also able to securely grip tools and use them to maximum effectiveness. The gloves also shed moisture and dirt pretty well, keeping them both out while not reducing them to useless balls of sludge on your hands.Unfortunately, the palm of the gloves was made too thin. After about 3 weeks of trail work, 2-3 hours a day 5 days a week, the synthetic leather tore off and exposed the fabric mesh underneath, which was slippery and basically nonexistent as protection. Another week of trail work and the palms were done. I had a useless pair of gloves where they did nothing to protect my hands and were hot while wearing them too. One of the fingers also split open, but that may be from branches or some other sharp object cutting the stitching open. I am not sure what caused the split finger.Overall, a good glove for cooler climates with good dexterity and feel. Strategic grip pad placement and a pretty decent fit make it for a likely valuable tactical glove. However, should you choose to do some work with these gloves and are looking to protect your hands better, look elsewhere. These are too thin to be used for anything that involves heavy wear and tear."
120184,1,"This thing was a huge help since I wanted a rack but my frame lacked predrilled wholes. I don't intend on putting a great deal of weight on the rack so I won't get to truly test its limits, which is a good thing. Only thing they could do to improve this toss in a couple of extra nuts, when I was installing my rack it fit nicely to the adapter, but I had to go dig around my garage with crossed fingers for 2 nuts, since the racks hardware assumed it was going into the frame. So keep the nuts in mind when you order this with a rack since you may get lucky and have spare parts (my rack had a few spare washers), but in the end most racks are gonna assume you only need them to mount the bracket to the rack, not the bracket to the bike."

However, it's annoying when a product come with a battery installed with no replacement. Buying a new one from local store could cost from $5 to $6 a piece. I ordered a pack of 5 from amazon for $3 with free shipping. The problem is that you have to wait for it to arrive. Anyway, other than that problem.The watch is reliable to some degree. It works but it take a while to work. Wearing the strap across your chest for a while feel uncomfortable.Shipping:Fast, well packed.Pro:It is unisex and very nice looking."

448094,1,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered the socks, and I was so pleasantly surprised. They are very comfortable... light padding on the sole, breathable upper and coolmax fabric, which helps keep your feet dry and cool.While the color and style is nice, my main concern with a sock is its performance. These stay in place and don't slip around. The price is right on for a sock of this quality ($5 per pair). I have some supposed high-performance coolmax socks that are more than $10 per pair and don't perform as well. After I tried them, I immediately ordered another 4 packages.I notice there's no longer an image available. The socks are mostly white anklet style, with the tommy logo on the outside. One pair in the pack has a pale pink padded heel and the other has a light gray padded heel.Definitely a must have for general-use sport sock."
138281,0,"I chose this dartboard because of the excellent reviews and low price. The colors, thickness and quality of the bristle is fine. Upon receipt, the bullseye area was compressed where the wires enter it, definitely a defect and a result of thick wires.The wires are too thick and poorly anchored. Because the wire is rounded and thick, many bounce outs occur... especially when aiming for the bullseye, where there are many wires converging on a small area.The bullseye is my biggest complaint. The wires are loose and have de-lodged from the bullseye. This happened within a few weeks of use!!! (see my photos)I would not recommend this item, but for $25 it is hard to pass up."

417527,0,"I bought this for my 18mo old in the spring, he loved that I could push him on his bike, only he would not keep his feet up on the foot rests, there should be over the foot holster things to help kids keep there feet on the pedal. My son got his foot stuck under the pedal several times.Now that he is 2 and starting to learn to use the self propel pedals while I push, he continuously gets his feet stuck between the tire and the pedal.The idea of saving parents money by making this was great, but they really need to rethink the safety issues of it as well. In fact with only 1 summer of useage on it, I went out and bought a real tricycle and will donate this to someone else."

The shoe tongue could have used more padding, or better yet, a design without laces is best for this martial art."

They are also a serious pain in the derriere to attack to the rack, especially if you have fat-ish rack tubes...really skinny tubes should be ok, or you could just use cable ties instead of the included screws/clips. But even if the clips fit your rear rack, you have to do some crazy hand acrobatics to fit your hand (and a screwdriver) around and underneath and behind and into various spaces...then the real challenge is having to turn the darn screwdriver. I would recommend just getting the Wald rear rack with these baskets already attached...Pros:Very sturdy, spaciousAffordableThe white color is attractive on my pink bike (see customer pics)Cons:Rusts QuicklyDifficult to install, especially on fat-tubed racks"

77491,2,"I have had one of these watches for quite a while and I had noticed the scratches on the lens as well as some on the bezel. But, I wasn't concerned with that. I buy stuff that I expect to work hard and stand up to my abuse so I spend more than I need to so that I will get handle it. All in all, I thought it was a nice watch that worked great and got noticed.The problem is that this watch is water ""resistant"" not water proof. If you notice that little bit of word play there you will understand my annoyance. I have used this watch many, many times while diving and had thought that it was A-OK for SCUBA. Especially after I had it down to 125Ft off Guantanamo bay and it came through with flying colors. So, this last weekend, while diving Catalina Island, I noticed that the lens was fogged. When I realized that it was fogged on the inside I just laughed. But, when I noticed that it had been 2:10 for quite a while I was aggravated. I had not had the watch below 60' which isn't even close to 600' that is advertised by the manufacturer. Water temperature was 59Degrees and I am not sure if that was a factor.All, in all, I would say it's a good watch but I really feel cheated by Citizen's false advertising."

I am usually fine with assembling just about anything, but this bike had me spouting some very un-Christmasy words, lol The directions are minimal to say the least, basically just a few sentences and an exploded diagram. Add to this the fact that several of the pieces need to be assembled in a specific order. Once they are put together, they are next to impossible to take apart again without causing damage. You need to be certain you have it correct the first time. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the seat height adjuster is awkward."

This is not specific to this particular ball, all of the free pumps suck. If you have a bicycle tire pump or something else do yourself a huge favor and use that instead. Go borrow one from your neighbor, buy one and return it, anything but don't bother to use the pump this ball comes with."

They do not have enough ballast built into the bottoms, and can spin around without feet in them. That ballast is supposed to keep the pedal upright, but the strap hits the floor, causing the bike to jerk and move.I put a piece of two by four under the back feet to raise the bike enough to fix the problem.

Just make sure you have another person to play this with and you'll be alright. Lots of options in this game though. My opinion: Wait and get NBA Live 2004... By the way, if this game comes out on Nintendo Gamecube the controls would be much easier. I just never thought the XBOX is a very good sports machine besides NFL Fever....

The compass was good enough to give you a good sense of direction and keep you going on the right vector, but I still relied on my pocket compass to do my land nav. I never really used the barometer or altimeter settings, so I can't really comment on those. The thermometer was really pretty accurate and if you look at temp reading while on your wrist I had to remember that it wasn't going to be spot on due to my body temp.The worst thing about this watch was it's strap. I'm talking in the past tense because I just lost the watch yesterday. I have already replaced the strap (about a year and a half ago) and it broke again. The only problem is I don't know when/where and I can't find the watch anywhere. So my advice would be to inspect your strap about once a month or so to look for cracking, etc. The strap should last a good 2-5 years depending on how often you wear the watch. A new strap will run you in the neighborhood of $100, but as another commenter wrote there are no options for a full titanium or even stainless steel strap."
51995,0,"these are nice ""classic"" soccer shorts. beware: these are extremely short, to a point where they can't be worn without a compression short or something like that below. they are very nice to run in and i would recommend them to people looking for a light, cool, soccer short to wear above compression shorts."

332443,2,I received this ski speedometer as a gift. It doesn't work and they won't take it back. The instructions were so difficult to follow that it took me two weeks of effort to figure out that it didn't actually work.
374707,1,"Arrived the day after I ordered them and the first thing I noticed when I pulled them out of the box was the weight. These are heavy pants which I love. The material is super thick, no worries about them tearing. The pockets are large, the sizing is generous. I ordered a 36/32, knowing full well that I wear a 38/32 in most pants, but I wanted these to last after I get back to my usual weight which fits a 34-36 nicely. The elastic waist band is nice, it easily stretches to size larger and shrinks to a bit under a size smaller. The legs are a nice loose fit. I have large thighs and where a lot of pants simply don't work, these give me the room I need. I just ordered a second pair of these and wish I could afford to buy all of them and wear nothing but these everyday. I simply love them. Great fit, great quality."
154189,0,"it arrived quickly, but it is to small , it would be one size fits all if your a child. but i still wear it and it looks good it just covers the top of my ears. so i guess you get what you pay for."
165187,2,"This product lived up to my expectations, but you should be warned that the maglite offer is not true. I ordered 5 of these for groomsmen at our wedding (about $150 purchase) and did not even receive a single maglite even though the minimum purchase was $25 and every knife we received repeated this offer. I wrote in about the error and never even received a reply email. Just a fair warning if you are buying this brand over another for the free gift."

404166,0,Ordered the tent and it arrived perfectly on time. I took it out and set it up in my backyard. The tent is big which I like. I used it for a few summers and it held up well till one day a wind came through and broke some of the poles. I would use it for light weather outings and some rain but no where with a lot of wind.
60125,2,"The theory behind this seat is sound: no horn pressing on your delicate parts, so no undesired numbing or pressure on those areas. The pleasant absence of this is noticeable immediately upon mounting this seat. However, the design of the seat is so bizarre that I kept asking myself, ""WTF?"".The major problem is that the seat is too long. Whereas a regular seat has a middle part that sticks out forward, this seat has side parts that stick out forward. The wide part of the Hobson seat sticks out far longer than the wide portion of any regular seat, so now you have a completely different problem created. The result is that the front of the seat digs into the back of the thighs (when the seat is raised to achieve correct bicycling geometry, so as to get a full down stroke when pedaling, ie, the leg is almost straight).The only way for me to avoid the seat-in-thigh problem was to angle the seat down so steeply that I was no longer sitting on the seat, but rather *leaning* on the seat. This created the problem of no longer having something to be able to sit on.A person at Hobson suggested that I try sitting on the front, rather than the back of the seat. This created an improper geometry for riding and felt as if one were at a bar while sitting at the very edge of a bar stool. It felt wrong.An additional problem is the wobbling that is designed into the seat. Every time I braked, the seat tilted downward and I would slip off the seat. And when you pedal, you feel as if you're wobbling atop your bike. WTF! Your seat is your foundation. You don't want it to be rocking around beneath you unpredictably! Trying to ride with this seat felt like being in a comedy of the absurd.I was told by Hobson that the tilting is supposed to alleviate the problem of poking into the thigh. It doesn't fix the problem, and it just creates another one.I'm quite a tinkerer with things, but try as I might, I couldn't find a way to make this seat comfortable. Not with proper bicycling geometry, anyway. I'm puzzled by the positive reviews of this seat and why their writers didn't experience the same problem I did. I can only surmise that they have improper seat geometry positioning, with the seat set too low, so that their thighs don't angle down very far when they pedal. This is very common, I see this all the time when bicyclists pass by. I guess they don't know better. That's a possible solution to the problem, but it makes for very inefficient riding.The sad thing is that the problems with this seat would be very easy to fix and an improved version would actually be cheaper to manufacture.The first problem would be fixed by simply making the seat shorter. It would also save Hobson materials cost in manufacture. If you research competing products, you will see that they have seen the wisdom of doing this. Hobson even does this with their newer version.The second problem can be fixed simply by taking the wobble ""feature"" out completely. As they say in the software industry, it's not a feature, it's a bug!Fixing the flaws in the seat would make it simpler, cheaper, & better. Why Hobson sits on its behind and doesn't fix the design flaws in this product is a puzzle to me."
190771,1,"The leotard is nicely put together and I love the fully lined front. It is made in the USA, which is another bonus. The picture is misleading because the leotards look like they have some shimmer. I ordered the purple one and there is no shine or shimmer. It's just a matte, light purple color."
195511,1,"Looks great, plays great. Thats really all there is to it! My only complaint would be that it doesn't have a screw on/off tip =[Other than that It's the best que stick i've ever used!I still give it 5 out of 5 easy!"
156131,1,"Very comfortable. However, they were a little shorter than I thought they would be from what the picture shows. I plan on buying more."
465009,1,this is a good gun. really powerful. it actually comes with cartrages that u put the bbs in so its cool.( u should put the bbs in from the bottom of the cartrage) it is very powerful and very accurate. it barely curves. the only pain about the gun is it only takes 6 shots. u hav 2 reload alot. if i was u i wouldn't use this in a airsoft war. if u do use it as a last resort gun not one u will u se alot.

430242,1,I have used this product over the years to sharpen my hunting knives. I was very imprest with the quality of the product and the ease of use. The instructions are also easy to follow. I purchased another Lansky Sharpening System and gave it to my son as a birthday gift.Paul Ramirez
12285,0,"Yes, and Yes. I always hesitate to order clothes on line because you can't touch and feel or try it on. So I ordered one vest. After receiving and wearing it during (for California) a cold spell I promptly ordered another. Met all expectations, warm enough - yes, right fit, yes, The price was an added bonus."
34644,2,These clamps are kinda flimsy-probably why they are cheap. Table edge must be exact size of the clamp or it doesn't work well. What are the odds of all tables being the same size?
432267,1,This product is excellent - I feel it will last the rest of my life. Was skeptical about buying something that uses my door jamb because newer home are built with such inferior products. But it work very well with my 200lb body. Only problems were was the assembly direction not real clear which would cause some other difficulty and black marks on the door frame. I now use a small towel over the grips. It is a durable and good product.
381865,1,"This was only one I can find willing to ship to Canada. Price is half of local dealer.My oraginal was cracked. it was very easy to replace, and took me 20 mins to finished the job."
488526,2,"Let me first say we know how to operate airsoft guns...we own a few already. This gun never worked. It was my son's birthday gift; needless, to say it was a major disappointment. The return procedure is cumbersome to say the least and there is no guarantee it will be fixed or replaced (and we're to pay the return shipping). We would have been better off flushing $45 down the toi-toi. I don't recommend this gun."
42072,2,"I would not spend my money on one of these again. One of the latches has already broken after about a month of use.It ""squirts"" the balls quite often instead of picking them up. I can pick up my balls with two baskets quicker than I can with this thing.Not worth what I paid for it."
483826,1,"These socks are what I've been looking for, well cushioned, comfortable, warm and a good fit.My feet are small (36/US 6) when it comes to trekker socks, so when I saw another customer's view of this one being a good fit to her small feet, I thought I'd try them for myself. And what a perfect fit they are! I'm not exaggerating when I say I've never come across socks that fit me this well until now.These are also much warmer than other pairs of trekker socks I've tried.I bought two pairs in oatmeal colour, both have been through quite a few washes and they still look as good as new."
419830,1,"I used this on a rocky ground in Haiti for two weeks, it really took the hardness out of the ground. Also I used this camping in 23F weather and it really worked well taking the chill out of the ground."
236523,0,I bought this to use on my Diamondback Response Sport with rear disk brakes and it didn't fit out of the package. There were also no instructions for how to mount it. I ended up fabricating an aluminum strap for the upper support to move the kickstand forward.
248513,0,"I've used this set on 10+ multi-day backpacking trips. It is extremely light weight, compact, and very inexpensive.I once took a tumble and the set's frying pan got pretty dented up. I was able to push out the dents and mold it back into shape with ease.However, the set has a few key design flaws that really make it a ""leave at home"" set. The frying pan's handle is made of thin aluminum and when lifting, the handle bends and will likely spill whatever you're cooking.Secondly, the swinging handle on the middle sized pot /w lid has no way to lock in place, so when you pick it up from the handle it swings back in forth spilling any liquid contents. The shallow pans and angled sides make it even more difficult to keep contents inside. Lastly, the small mug's handle absorbs heat from the mug very quickly, and then retains that heat longer then the beverage (basically by the time the handle has cooled enough to grab, the drink is cold.) Now, after you have experienced all the flaws, and learn to work around them its just too much effort.Overall, even with all the faults, its not too bad of a set. If the manufacturer were to make a few minor adjustments to the design, it would be a much better."
243927,0,"This little raft has brought me a lot of fun this summer. My few complaints are the same as everyone else's though - needs better paddles (which I also found on Amazon, and am super happy with), and a pump more efficient than the one included. I've also managed to spring a leak after the 6th trip out on the lake. It's probably coming from the seams, but I'm having a tough time locating the source of the leak. Here's hoping I can find it & that the patch kit will work. Otherwise, incredibly comfortable with two adults, easy to maneuver, lots of fun."

49207,0,"For a cheap tire these Sun tires (Kenda972) are great. You won't see them on the Kenda website, they are an OEM tire.They measured about 57.75mm wide at 32psi on both a 25mm & a 32mm wide rim.The carcass is not heavy duty, in fact they seem a tad flimsy. I loved the soft ride on a cruiser, but I would add tire liners. I rode them 'till I noticed splits in the tread, not the sidewall. Don't misunderstand, I put a lot of miles on them and the bike & myself weighed 315lbs!If you just need a new set of tires for that old cruiser, they are an excellent choice, very smoooooooth, cushiony ride. The tread is shallow, so no knobby ride! I liked them better than the Schwalbe ReTurner HS-361, they are a few mm wider, if you're going to spend more money, then go all in & get the Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430 at 3 times the money (but you don't need liners)."
241619,0,"Got this bike. Was excited initially. But then after assembly, I found that the chain would rub against the cage except for one combination of gears. Not sure what should I do. Take it to a dealer and get it fixed but should not be needing to do that on a brand new bike.Also bike had a big dent when it arrived even though package was intact. I would stick to Schwinn and other ""real"" bicycle manufacturers!"
364631,0,I ended up returning this holster and went with a blackhawk serpa paddle set up. I was using it for a glock 26. My complaint with this holster is that the handle sits pretty far from your body. well over an inch and a half in my case. This makes concealing a pistol in this holster almost impossible. I think that this happens because the pistols sits so high on the paddle that it flops a little bit. You can see on the pic what I mean. I haven't tried this model of holster on smaller guns. The quality of the materials was very good and the fit and finish was very good.If you would like to know something specific about this item just ask and I'll try to respond within a day or so.

275970,0,Nicely constructed backpack but on my screen the black plaid shows as black/purple. Actual item is black/white/gray. Had to return for this reason only.
11205,0,"I really like Columbia Sportswear Jackets, so decided to try the vest ... The fabric is the same soft, warm, fleece as the jackets but the fit in the vest seems awkward ... For instance the XL in the jacket is a perfect fit for me, but in the vest I had to exchange the XL for a L ... The vest seems to run a size larger, and I think it would be a better design had they also included the bottom draw strings on the vest as they have on the jackets (being that the vests cost as much as the jackets) ... Had I been able to find a brown vest in the style of a black one I got from Land's End I would have returned this L also ... Bottom line for me Columbia Sportswear Jackets 5*'s, the best I can give this vest is 3*'s."
209719,0,"As far as repelling bugs, it was the best non-DEET formula I've tried. One downside: It's pretty smelly. I have to double ziplock it to keep everything else in my bag from smelling like it. The scent dissipates a few minutes after applying it to yourself/clothes though."
127339,0,"The item I received from BikeWorldUSA is the original cyclist mirror. No helmet adapter (which the ad says is included). You can clip it to your glasses or perhaps to a visor using the three-segment arm shown in the picture, but if there IS such a thing as a helmet adapter it's not shown and it's not shipped. It seems like using the glasses clip on a visor would work. My helmet has no visor so I can't say for sure."
338275,1,"First, I want to thank everyone who has written a review for all the different types of pedometers. I researched several different ones and I chose this one because of the good reviews and the relatively good pricing.I'm impressed with the pedometer. It looks very nice, not too bulky and it works pretty well. I'd say it's about 96ish% accurate. I did some testing with it, counting my steps and seeing how much the pedometer recorded. Below are the results of the testing:(For each test, I took 50 steps)1. walk- recorded 502. walk- 523. jog- 514. jog- 515. walk up stairs- 506. stairs- 427. slow walk- 498. slow walk- 509. fast walk- 5010. fast walk- 46The overall accuracy average during the tests was: 49.1/50I'd say that's pretty good results for a pedometer of this price. Many other pedometers I've looked at don't seem to come close to this accuracy. This is a great little gadget!"

88234,1,This knife stays in my pocket wherever I go. It is so small I never know I am carrying it. I can't tell you how many Amazon boxes I opened with it this Christmas (3 kids under 7). It is about 18 months old and I have never sharpened it (no have I needed to). The action is smooth with just the right amount of tension to open it. The greatest tribute was kicking back after a tough day with some buddies with a few cold ones. All of us realized that no one brought a bottle opener. It took me a minute and then I remembered that little knife also had a bottle opener. A potentially tragic situation was overted.
333532,2,"I agree with many of the other reviewers that this bike tips over very easily. My son does know how to pedal a bike, and yet this tips without any warning. He has gotten caught underneath the bike, and had the handlebars turn so that he needed help to get the bike off of him so he could get up. The only positive aspects are that we store ours outside and it has held up well, also, my son was able to reach the pedals before he turned 2 (he is a lttle under the 50% for height) so he was able to learn to pedal on this bike. As a side note, the 2 most positive reviews for this bike are over 18 months old, I think it is quite possible they have a different model than what is currently available."
446147,1,"We love these shirts! The only complaint that I have is that the green color is darker in reality, it almost looks black is some light."
205478,2,"I was searching Amazon for a rain jacket when this product came up. Reasonably priced, I decided to make the purchase. After receiving the item I realized that is was NOT rainproof as advertised. I returned the item with the return shipping lable and a description for why I was making my return, via UPS and was charged $7.65 for return shipping. I was credited by the company for my purchase but NOT for shipping, as a result I paid $7.65 for nothing. I am disapointed that the company had advertised the jacket as a rain jacket when it is not."

394350,0,"These shorts are just fine. They're not the greatest cycling shorts I own, but not the worst. These aren't compression shorts. Just spandex with elastic around the legs. The padding is again, not fantastic, I wouldn't wear it for a century, but it's just fine for shorter rides.That's about it. Pretty average. They look pretty cool, and they're made well for what they are."
284052,0,"Loved my first pair but in less than a year, the rubber at the toe end started to split. So the next time around, I took much better care of the fins. I rinsed them off after each and every time in the pool. Also, stored them in a dry cool closet. This second pair lasted a little less than two months before it started to split. I bought the right size and it went on easily and was very comfortable and for the short time I had this second pair, I found them to be the very best pair of fins I had ever worn. If I had money to throw away, I would buy them again in a heartbeat. So now I am back to my old pair of fins. Motto is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
47438,0,"I'm not quite sure what can be said about this hoodie other than the fact that somehow a unisex 3X adult size still was small enough for people to think that I was wearing my wife's clothes.Okay, so the hoodie is pink. But I like pink.Still, the fabric is not thick and the sizing runs small. If you're overweight like I am, this hoodie will leave nothing to the imagination."

168553,0,"Bought this last Christmas, it made it through the summer, but by this point is no longer has any grip. So I got the kids another one this Christmas. At this price ($8.99) I believe we got our value out of it but feel it should have stood up to a little more abuse than it did."
499300,1,"I liked this set because it had a lot of $1 and 5$ chips plus the dealer and blind coins. It also came with other coins, cards and dice. This is one heavy set. I do worry that the aluminum case isn't durable enough. I can see the handle breaking if you are not careful. Just handle it tenderly and you should be fine. The felt lining inside the case also isn't designed to handle the weight. Still a good set for the price."
411783,1,"Having spent A LOT of money on gym memberships I can't seem to use with my crazy schedule, I warily decided to try The Total Body Works 5000 Gym. There are so many pieces of bad equipment out there, and the price seemed way too reasonable. I was very pleasantly surprised when I set it up and gave it a try. I can barely change a light bulb, but was able to quickly assemble the few bolts in little time. I went on You Tube and watched a few regular guys (still in pretty good shape) use it before purchasing. I just don't trust a piece of equipment on TV that features fitness models who do everything perfectly on camera. It's pretty stable even if I rock a bit when setting myself up, and can adjust the incline without too much difficulty. I'm a tad over 6'2"" and can comfortably lay on my back with my feet at the bottom of the pad (legs bent) or my stomach (legs curled back) to do pull ups. I wouldn't go much taller than that. The exercise guide is helpful, but it only shows a start and finish position picture so you will have some trial and error on your own to get it right. There are 4 bands to add more resistance, and they are extremely easy to use. The motion is also very smooth. It's pretty tall and long, but can fold down if needed. I also combine it with my Power Block curl set (also a great buy) since I do want to mix in some free weights. It's still pretty new, and if it holds up it will pay for itself in 6 months as compared to years of gym fees."

402067,0,"The Halex Ping Pong set is simply adequate and at less than $10 for two paddles, three balls, a net and the screw-clamp net posts, priced great for folks with a needy table that has turned up while deconstructing the barracaded garage or cellar. These are the folks that know Ping Pong gets played in generational spurts, sometimes for only a week or a month every ten years... so why spring for Gump-quality gear? The paddles are each red and blue rubber-faced, not sandpapered, which helps keep the noise down when your dorm mate is sleeping off a liquid lunch. The balls are quite round from every angle of view. The net is appropriately table-green, no fashion-risks here... and the metal net posts cleverly fit only one way ontop to any table with perpendicular or slightly rhomboid edge relations.Halex 57285 2.5 Player Lightning Table Tennis Set"

I will contact the manufacturer to sort out this problem."

142135,1,"I just received my suit today and it looks great, but it's definitely more snug than my old speedo suit. It's not so bad that I'm sending it back or anything (I'm working on shrinking anyway...this will be extra incentive). It has some nice stomach holding in advantages...I look very svelte and shapely coming...just please don't look at the cutout back bits as I'm going!If I'm honest I would probably have been a bit more comfortable going up a size on this suit, but I (arrogantly) figured that since I'm already swimming in a Speedo suit, the size issue wouldn't apply to me. I just ordered the same size I've been wearing, and it's definitely tight. I'll reserve final judgement until I swim a full workout in it, though. If you prefer a tight fit (and I know plenty of swimmers do) order the size you normally wear. It's a good looking suit, well constructed and with nice details that are visually slimming. You won't be sorry. For everyone else, go up a size."

502029,1,I train mma and wasn't sure how well this product would help with staying limber or help my kicks. I also wasn't sure which stretcher would be the best to buy. After reading reviews I got this one and it was a very good choice. I am very satisfied with it and now several of my friends want one after using mine. So I do recommend this to anyone wanting to buy a leg stretcher.
386986,0,"I like that this was made with apparently American raw materials however I find the stitching to be crudely done.The reflective plastic material is sewn onto a crunchy piece of velcro nylon, and the sewing was too close to the edge so that the reflective material is about to come loose on some sections.The nylon base strap material is hard and can be scratchy if you velcro to tight. I loosely wore around my ankles and after run there was slight skin impressions. Perhaps after a few washings it might soften up."

324931,1,"This dirk is not only functional, but very handsome as well. The wood and blue steal go great together. The blade is VERY sharp. It feels comfortable in hand and slices nicely. This is a dirk you can wear with your kilt to dress it up, and wear for protection.A few bad points, the blade will rust or tarnish easily, so take good care of it. I didn't oil mine quick enough and I have a little stain on the blade the size of a nickel. Also, the leather on the sheath is hot glued rather than stitched. This isn't a huge deal as no one will see it while you are wearing it, but under close inspection, it does look odd as the fake stitching doesn't line up. Overall very satisfied with my purchase."
13653,2,"The largest size I've ever worn is 8M (stilettos, flip-flops, athletic shoes, flats, etc.) from varying brands. According to Injinji's Web site, size small fits up to size 8 shoes in women, but it is short, causing a very snug, somewhat uncomfortable fit. As a result, I've only worn them once to exercise. I was worried that they may slip underneath but they did not. However, the fit and whether or not they will stay in place is definitely not a good thing. They also came out fuzzy in the wash. I'm keeping all six because the inconvenience of returning them to Amazon is too much."
155781,0,"I bought two pairs of these shorts for my wife for our Taekwondo class to wear under her uniform. Like others have mentioned, they are not very tight fitting and run a little bit big, so my wife wound up giving them to me to use (they are unisex shorts, the packaging is the same as the men's shorts). Still, they aren't as tight or as well-constructed as my Franklin compression shorts, nor are they as form fitting as my wife's compression shorts that were purchased from Wal-Mart. These aren't necessarily bad shorts, but I'd have to rate them as average."

31631,0,"This and another watch like it have not worked for me, I do not know if my ICD (pacemaker/defibrilator)interupts it or what. But I sent it back, got my refund and am veery pleased with how Amazon handled the transaction."
447199,0,"The vest is comfortable overall. I don't know about the other sizes but the 4XL-7XL has two unshown, lower straps that apparently go between the legs. The straps were not uncomfortable, even while sitting, but I returned the vest because of the indignity of wearing it while sailing (and the possibility of an unexpected painful shift). The side adjustment straps are well-designed for a wide range of bodies. I thought about keeping it and cutting off the lower straps but decided to return it."
129485,0,"I purchased this item becuase my 8 year old daughter's tendency was to drop her hands, shoulder, and bat while hitting. She would open her swing too early and had such a difficult time getting her hands out in front. Though I would demonstrate to her how to properly swing she didn't seem to grasp my instruction. This swing tee was what I was looking for and after only one swing session on this tee my daughter realizes now how she's been dropping her hands. It did take a few whacks to the frame of the tee, and that painful vibration to her hands, to grasp what she was doing wrong. Shortly though, she began to keep the hands, shoulder, and bat up and swing properly. This item met my expection.Now, the reason I gave this item only three stars. I received this item yesterday and immediately set it up. After about ten minutes each of swing practice for my 8 and 6 year old daughters, two of the three included rubber tees, which the ball seats on, had cracked in half. I'm on my last rubber tee and likely will have to purchase replacement tees at about $16 for a 3-pack. This is absolutely unacceptable for a product in this price range! My take is that the rubber tees are too stift, not enough flexibility to withstand continuous strikes from a bat. The solution to this is to use some rubber glue compound, purchase the replacement tees, or purchase the Louisville Slugger Retract-A-Ball & Tee Attachment For Instructo Swing Batting Tee for additional $60 which angers me oven more. The link to this item on Amazon is included below.http://www.amazon.com/Louisville-Slugger-Retract-Attachment-Instructo/dp/B00183HOOI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=sporting-goods&qid;=1300024464&sr;=1-1My other complaint with the 1500 model is that it doesn't allow for a slight upward swing as pictured on the 5000 model. Also, the full downward setting (swivel fully to the right) is too angled, so much so that I wasn't able to place a softball, baseball, tennis ball, or wiffle ball on the rubber tee and have it remain. It would make more sense that the angle from the base pole that attached to the C-style rubber encased ""hitting zone"" would be 90 degrees given how the base pole is able to swivel. Swiveling the tee fully to the left allows for a level swing. Swiveling straight up allows for a nice downward cut. Anything to the right, you're better off purhcasing that Retract-A-Ball & Tee Attachment that I likely will end up having to do. I'll be contacting Amazon today to express my complaints with the replacement rubber tees. But for purposes of you considering my review, I would recommend this product because I've already seen a difference with both my daughter's swings after only one use.Update: I've since purchased replacement rubber tees from another website. I had the same problem which after only a few swings the rubber tees cracked in half. I had actually supported the rubber tees by taping with black electrical tape. This made no difference and within one day of using the replacement rubber tees with my 8U softball team, they all cracked in half after only two batters. These rubber tees are horrible, absolutely terrible. What I've done since then is to use a separate rubber tee and position it flush to the Louisville swing tee. I love how this swing tee demonstrates a proper tee but the rubber replacement tees are absolutely terrible. Do not purchase any replacement tees and it's a complete waste of money.I did elect not to purchase the Retract-a-ball tee attachment because I just don't foresee the foam casing lasting long after multiple strikes. Does Louisville actually believe that children will strike the ball without striking the rubber tee."
443680,0,"I bought the 24 oz. bottle. I am disappointed that it does sweat a lot and leaves a puddle on my desk. Also, I filled it completely with ice, then with cold water, and even in an air conditioned office, the water was warm after 4 hours. I expected it to last longer. Last night I filled the bottle half/way and put in the freezer, then filled with cold water this morning and at noon I still have cool water. I do like the wide mouth which makes it easy to put ice in. I will keep looking for the perfect water bottle!"

316511,0,"The product was helpful for a few weeks. The greatest resistance isn't that challenging though. If you continue to get stronger and increase the resistance every use, this product will only last you two months at best. It is a better choice than grip strengtheners that cannot vary in resistance though."
243662,0,"I bought the tee to sleep in, but the texture just a little too rough for sleeping, for me. But it's a nice daytime tee. It doesn't seem to shrink in the wash, so that's a plus."

145310,2,"I had to return this product on the day I received it from amazon.When I opened up the product to insert the battery, the light set literally crumbled in my hands. And I was being careful.In my disbelief I inspected it further and new pieces kept falling apart. The very tiny and cheap plastic piece holding the bulb fell apart next, the tiny metal and precariously soldered piece holding the circuit just gave up doing what it was made to do. And all this 10 minutes out of the package.God forbid I actually have to mount this thing on a bike and expose it to the elements.I returned it immediately. Poor product, poor experience and I had to eat the shipping cost."
436642,0,these shorts run small and the elastic in the waistband is not very nice quality - kinda stiff and chunky. For athletis shorts to be worn exercising or working in the yard they are acceptable but they look cheap and I wouldn't wear them in public.
278760,1,"They have a 10 year expiration life. What can I say, they are batteries. I recommend this product. Thank you."
199496,2,"The good news: this is a very nice product. Gives you all the info you need / want in a very nice package. Couldn't have asked for more for this price (or even double the price).The bad news: if anything goes wrong this company has no idea of how to treat you well. The warranty is short, and the company makes you jump through hoops. My first bike computer had a bad clip, so the head flew off during a ride, never to be found again. The company made me return the whole (remaining) setup, detaching it from the bike even though I'd have to reattach the exact parts again when the new one arrived. Later, when the product was out of warranty, it stopped working. A very nice support person said if I sent it back they'd send a replacement. 6 weeks went by and no new one. I had to call to find out a supervisor rejected the claim because I had previously received a replacement under warranty. And I lost the postage for the return.Bottom line: the company should make returns easier, and should stand behind their products with longer warranties. I won't buy another Schwinn (anything) now even though I enjoyed my time using this one."
834,1,Excellent workes great and very sturdy to sleep on. The fact that the pump is built in is the best feature
45668,0,"Pros:I love the concept. This tent fits my silverado 1500 shortbed just right. Easy to setup and take down.Cons:Considering the high cost ($199.95), quality of construction is poor. The material is obviously bottom tier. I have a strong feeling that it won't be long before the seams start to come undone.I wanted to give 4 stars, but I just can't get past the poor quality. If the price were lower or the quality higher, I would be a lot happier with it."
64421,1,"Good quality for the price. We got it for our son's fifth birthday. He really enjoys riding it. It still looks brand new and he's not exactly gentle with it. It's very easy to adjust, even he can do it. We found this scooter on amazon for the same price as the lower model at a local store. It shipped really quickly and was here in plenty of time."

216114,2,"Having gotten it for a couple of days, tt injured my friend's kids. They send mailed to Honda Motors, they are slow to return replies. Now, their legal councilor is suggesting suing Honda for this unthoughtful toy.The very bad and unfortunate thing is that your kid won't learn algebra, not physics, nor skills that help them succeed in school with this toy.If your kid does not know how to balance on a bike, how to stop, how to turn, stay away from this non-educational toy. Only if you want your kids to be exposed to as high of a risk as the kind of Formula racings injuries; including broken joints, bones, head injuries and scratches, should you consider buying this piece of junk."
505776,1,It does what it's supposed. The only drawback is twisting the tablet holder onto the duck top. It takes precision to hold the duck at just the right angle to catch the screw grooves for a proper secure attachment. I love the cute factor.
242410,0,I have always loved Russell shirts but my local store doesn't stock them any more. Ordered several online and was a little dissapointed. The fit was the same but not nearly as thick of a cotton as what I used to get. Delivery was quick though.
147092,0,This mat is a good size. Bigger than most. A little pricey considering there is no ball return and the Holes and Water traps are just cut outs from the box. I bought a ball return for it and I'm pretty satisfied over all though.
276122,2,"Got this to add to the playroom and its still in pieces...very hard to put together. My husband is deployed and why did I think I could do this myself, lol. The directions say you need 2-3 adults...terrible purchase."

469765,0,"My only complaint is that it is wayyyy too soft. Other than that, it does everything I want it to. The volume does throw me off a lot though....I play the flute and can't hear it at all when I am playing in the high register."
237301,0,"They were apparently incorrectly labeled.Even though they said 3xl, they were much too small. I think they should have been marked 1xl, or, marginally 2xl."
121828,0,Pros:It's clip motion is quicker and requires less dexterity than threading strap though D-ringsWorks as advertisedCons:Feels like cheap plastic (will it snap apart if I crash?)Had to cut off snap on end of strap to installCan pinch against skin when trying to closeCan accidentally disassemble when trying to put on (the female side of the clip has a snap in piece that connects it to the strap with the D-rings - it can come apart of you grab the part wrong - may glue it in place).Am I going to stop using it? Probably not.Am I going to buy another one? Probably not.
364616,1,"my daughter is 12. she likes the one piece style of mask, and the piece under the chin on this one. it's a lot easier to throw the mask off. she didn't want a hockey style mask, and there was only this one and a rawlings one that came in this style. we got the larger size. it seemed too big at first, but once we adjusted the straps, i think it will work fine."
501802,1,I don't wear flip flops because they hurt btwn my toes. My friend ordered a size 7 that was too small for her. I wear a size 6 so she brought them to me to try. I was skeptical. Wow! I just ordered myself a pair in a neutral color so I can wear them with everything. They are now my every day footwear for summer.
106950,1,"In case you are wondering if the pocket in the run belt will hold a Smartphone, it does! I just purchased a Droid Incredible by HTC, and even in a plastic baggy (on those rainy days), the phone fits in the pocket. You will need to stretch the flap over to secure it to the velcro, it is snug, but it fits. I also wear this belt around my waist, not my hips. I tried it around my hips, but like other reviews, it doesn't stay put and it gets irritating. Also like another reviewer stated, it takes two hands to reinstall the water bottles. I love to run, but I don't consider myself a serious runner (due to hip issues, 6-7 miles is my max), so it works fine for me."
283197,0,"I wanted to respond to the reviewer who thought that ""this was just a piece of styrofoam"". I have been wearing helmets before it was popular to do so and I can say that bicycle helmet technology for the average consumer has evolved over the last thirty years from hard shelled neck strainers that you hated to wear to the affordable lightweight aerodynamic styrofoam shells of today. That ""piece of styrofoam"" is what give you the protection you need for the event that you hope never happens. Proper fitting is still necessary even with the most expensive helmets and this helmet needs slightly more fiddeling than others. It does not come with extra fitting pads. I use extra pads from my other helmets. The plastic cover on top which I believe is not just for decoration but also allows the helmet to slide a bit to reduce the jolt of the initial impact is not adhered to the expanded polystyrene foam shell. I brought this as a loaner for $5 in case one of friends shows up for a visit and we decide to go biking with the kids."
395481,0,"This workout by Stamina is a short upper body. It is a little easy but good if you are just learning the reformer. It is good if you need a short workout or are trying to get the upper body in shape, you can add this every day to your regular workout."
159137,0,"I bought 10 different color pair of these gloves. I love all the fun colors, but the gloves showed significant wear after only one time. They looked worse and showed more wear than gloves I've worn for months. The gloves appear to be very thin or weak material. Too bad because I love the fit and the color choices."
430719,1,"The Lansky Super ""C"" Clamp gives a rock steady base for the Lansky sharpener. It makes the sharpener not only easier to use, but much less tiring in it's use. Makes the sharpener work like it's supposed to. I have used the clamp for a couple months now and I have super sharp knives to boot. A real time saver."
290316,1,I love the color black. It keeps me warm and dry. I wear a little jacket underneath to keep me warm due to the super cold weather we are having. I also like to adjust at the wrist. Very nice jacket.

But he liked it and that's all that matters."
404109,0,"If you like thickly cushioned socks, like the thickest Thorlos, these are not for you. They are not nearly as cushioned.Also, unless you have calves the size of twigs, they are not going to be comfortable. I wear an 11-1/2 wide shoe and I'm a big guy. Thorlos XL fits fine; these are so narrow at the top that they are impossible for anyone of even average size to wear them pulled up as high as shown in the photo.Other comments -- Delivery was very fast; price is way too high."
240277,0,I ordered 2 shirts: 1 Oxford and 1 Green. I received the Oxford but never received the green one and now it does not even show I ordered it. I would give the shirt 5 stars but the order problem is not right.
10478,1,"First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected. And for the price, it's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely, i got the green large. I'm a male 5'11"" and about 190 lbs. It fits me very nicely. Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour, shape and stretch. It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it's not too brutal but a t-shirt just doesn't cut it.The collar is one it's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind. The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints, I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised, obviously i can't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets. They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting. If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way... Just make sure you remember to close the zips! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm, but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys, phone or wallet.While we're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch. it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $20 it's hard to imagine a better purchase!"
199011,1,We like these ramps -- the quality is good and they are easy to put together / take apart. We keep them outside all year round (Chicago area) and they are holding up fine.
166892,2,"I was very disappointed with these binoculars from the moment I took them out of the box. Overall, they felt to me to be much of much less quality than the previous reviews led me to believe. I found them to have a nice and acceptable image when used , but because of the casing I found the binoculars to be very uncomfortable to handle. The strap and case I found to be cheaply made, as well. I also found that the only rubber protection is the green colored casing. The black is hard plastic which I feel will be vulnerable to damage when used. I have since found a much better pair of compact binoculars, the Pentax UCF-R, which I enjoy much better and I feel are much better made. The Alpens have since been re-gifted!"
1598,1,"These shorts work just fine and dont stretch at all throughout my workouts. I primarily bought them to help with chaffing while running, and so far i have not chaffed at all."
126655,0,"I'm 5'4 and weigh 110 lbs and with this seat I am about an inch higher and it's harder for me to pedal and reach the floor. I don't have enough weight to even feel the cushion and it was too stiff for me. My husband is 6'4 and weighs 230 lbs and he loved it, but it's not for him so I had to return it to find something more soft. So it's good for those that have enough weight to actually utilize the gel seat."
449895,0,"It got use on Xmas day, and that's all so far. It worked OK, not great, but it worked. I couldn't rate this on daily use, I think it might not last a very long time, as it is pretty cheaply made. '3' is a 'not bad, not good' review. I got all the mileage from it I needed as it was my clever 'xmas family card playing day' gift. No-one shuffled on the 25th!"
193397,1,Simply brilliant. I can put lots of water and ice in a large mouth bottle. Screw Gription handle on it lock the cap and lay it on its side and no drips. Attach it to a bottle that slips in the drink holder and off we go. It is just great. Admittedly I baulked at the cost and even had a brief period of buyrs remorse as I thought big deal until the inevitable slip and over it feel. 32 ounces of Gatorade and ice No worries. not a drop on the carpet. Nuff Said.

130660,1,These pants are wonderful. They keep you warm and move with you. I have washed them many times and they have held their shape and not pilled like other fleece products. I should have bought 10 pair.
505266,0,I have had knee issues lately and the turbo fire dvds really bother them so I do not do them much. This is a very intense workout program. Not for beginners. Luckily I have done a lot of turbo jam in the past so I know the moves but this is a little too intense for me right now. Disappointed because of how much I spent on this and also chalean extreme which I also do not care for. Turbo Jam was the original and the best IMO. I wish she could go back to that at least somewhat instead of being so hardcore now. Not everyone loves that.
186986,0,"It does the trick of keeping water out and it dries pretty darn fast, but the fit is something that could be improved. Maybe I have skinny legs or something, but, while the waistband is borderline tight, I still feel like I'm wearing a loose garbage bag over the rest of my lower body."

It's very complicated and hard to follow. They need to hire someone else to rewrite the manuel. Also, the Hex Screws that they give you are HORRIBLE. After a week I've still not been able to get this thing put together so that it does not wobble. Why would anyone choose to use HEX Screws on a piece of solid equipment like this. I've been unable to tighten the screws all the way and have hurt my hand several times trying to do so. I would appreciate it if Nautilus would send me regular screws to replace these so that I can put my stand together and use it."

For my zipcode, it was $7 for shipping. So not only can you get it there, you can get it cheaper. About the product itself, it's fine. It fits in the palm easily, built for aiming better than other pepper sprays, and doesn't look like pepper spray if you don't want to be obvious in regular situations. I think someone listed the spray distance and number of sprays but the package listed it more than what that person wrote. I can't remember but I think it was 10 sprays for 8 ft distance."

78276,0,"The Katana is a smooth and quick ride. I bought it as a great beginners bike into cycling, and will probably upgrade to a better bike in the near future. With most other intro bikes being in the $500-700 range, this is a great value for the price. It kinda sucks that the shifters aren't integrated with the breaks, but it's not too big of a hassle.Some issues:1) That bolt for the front derailer is missing like everyone else said. The one person who found it in their box was lucky. While looking through the box I noticed that one of the flaps actually has a big gap that opens up to the outside, so it probably rolled out during shipping. That's just annoying when you pay $350 for a product.2) The handlebars are bent to the left! It could be from the shipping, but I'm going to need to put this in a vice or something, it's seriously off by probably 7-10 degrees!3) Both the tires are warped. Had to take off the tires and adjust the spokes to get them straight. Didn't expect that from new wheels.4) The welds are huge and unsmoothed, there's also a big sloppy glob in it too.5) There were a lot of paint blemishes."

The elastic band doesn't bother me at all.I will say they are SHORT and SMALL. I generally wear a small and I ordered large for these (though a medium probably would have worked too).

70441,0,"The watch received was 9204A, which is slightly different than described. The main obvious difference is the second hand has a small Invicta logo on the small end, a picture of this can be seen on theInvicta Men's 10664 Pro Diver Collection Bracelet and Rubber Watch Set.The bezel usually looks slightly lighter, and more blue than the dial, but this varies with the light. In full sunlight, it has a beautiful purple dial.Other things of note is that mine has a screw down crown, other reviewers seem to have not received them with these feature. The date magnifier in my opinion is stupid and I will probably get it removed. The lume isnt very good, didnt seem to last very long after being out all day.One last thing is about the packaging. I dont know what the return turnaround system is for Amazon, but I will say that the watch box and even the watch may have been used but returned. I think this is well within reason since as noted, the description is a little off. Anyways, the soft plush spacer that the watch goes around in the box was a little dirty and maybe even slightly worn, and the watch itself has a slight scratch on the side of the clasp. The watch itself seemed factory sealed but again, I dont know how returns work internally. I know this isnt the same for all the watches, Im just pointing that out for if you plan on purchasing from Amazon itself.All in all a great watch and despite almost returning it, I have really come to like it.EDIT: After wearing this watch for a while, as well as sizing it, I have found a quality problem where I didnt expect... The link pins are rusted. On a stainless steel DIVING watch. Now I'm not a diver or anything, Im one of those chumps who buy it for looks. But really, that is just dumb. I also retract my previous statement on it including a screw down crown. This is untrue, it is NOT a screw down crown. I still like the watch, it looks good and keeps time, so I still wear it. But I am reducing it from 4 to 3 stars."

20253,1,"First off I would like to thank all the reviewers of this tent on this site...their reviews convinced me to buy this tent over others. What a GREAT choice! Set the tent up in the backyard to try it out. Instructions were actually pretty good once you figure out where the roof/middle poles go...that was the only part of the instructions that slowed me down...the rest were spot on. This tent is HUGE, spacious and pretty cool looking. Ventilation is awesome, no leak check as of yet so no comments there. Back to the setup, I did notice that before you start clamp everything down (stakes and such) you need to tug on the pole you are at to kinda tighten it up..seems the poles move in during setup and this looks like it would cause the other reviewers problems of notso tight in one area but super tight in another. My tent went up evenly taut all around with no problems using this technique. I really like the way the tent is designed with half being a screen/entry room and the other half designed to be a sleeping area. It's very nice to be able to zip up the screen room divider (can zip up cover on the divider for privacy if needed) this keeps the bugs out of the sleeping area while going in and out of the tent. Obviously the front/screen room area can be a sleeping area too. Zipping the covers up on the room divider is like moving into another tent. They are that quality! I'll admit I've never owned a tent this large and it currently has me a little awestruck, however this tent is perfect for me the wife and our 5 kids..plenty of room and space to manuever. If you are looking for a quality large tent then I don't think this one can be beat for the price..I'd recommend this for any family the size of mine or smaller. Thanks again to all the reviewers, I'm really happy with this tent.UPDATED NOTE: Finally took the tent out on a real camping trip over the 4th of July. Rained for the first 2.5 days...this tent was the only tent out of our group of 5, that did not leak...straight out of the box so to speak...this tent performed greatly in the constant rain! It's so good..that at least 2 of the 5 families have now bought this tent! Personally, I like it so much, I have just ordered another one..one tent for the kids to stomp around in (and my kids friends), and one for me and the wife to live in total comfort while camping :) Simply the best peforming tent I've seen!"
308334,1,"The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected. I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt, and this shirt fit nice and snug, not too tight. It was exactly as I had hoped it would be. As most other Under Armour products, it's very breathable and stretchy. I've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders, but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over, while still remaining snug against the skin. It's not outrageously priced, but it's not cheap either - obviously you're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I'd look a little better in it!If you're looking for a full set of top and bottom, check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms.

248039,1,"Bought this for a light jacket or base layer under a heavier jacket. Love the look and feel of this jacket, I get lots of compliments and inquiries when I wear it. The exterior is buttery soft and smooth, no signs of fading yet, though I rarely have to wash it, you can just wipe off the exterior with a damp cloth. Deep front side pockets with zippers, large mesh inner right pocket for gloves/phone, draw cords on each side at the bottom and behind the neck. There is slight tapering and light elastic in the cuffs of the wrists. The chest pocket is really small, good luck getting a bigger cell phone in there (maybe). My ipod touch (in a hard case) fits with about 1/4 inch to spare at the top and not much room for anything else. Fine for some lip balm, keys, other small items. I'm 5-9 and the large extends about 6"" below my waist. The rest of the jacket is very roomy on me, and the arm length still has room to spare but you can't tell due to the fabric consistency. I think it fits perfect and does not feel big or baggy. Compared to my last jacket of similar style, a Columbia Titanium, I like this jacket much better. It's a little heavier than the Titanium and appears a bit more solid in construction. Unlike the Titanium, I have not experienced any piling of the material over heavy wear areas. Easy to pack and stow, I always keep this in my car in the spring and summer when I normally don't have to wear a jacket (just in case). Great for a base layer/windbreaker/light jacket. Water repellency and breathability appear to be what the manufacturer claims. Some things I would like to see in the same jacket (or maybe they already have it on a different model)? Another inner zipper pocket on the left side, larger chest pocket and maybe a zippered/stowable hood of the same material attached to the jacket. Also, how cool would it be to have the MHW logo's subdued in black on this jacket?"
428272,1,"I have owned many multi-tools and bought one of the first leatherman's when they came out. The Gerber beats them all. The one handed operation is great for whipping it out for a quick fix. You just have to get your hand positioned correctly to have the pliers slide out quickly, but it's a breeze once you get the hang of it. I've owned the same Gerber 05500 MP400 Compact Sport for several years now and use it EVERY day. When I worked as a carpenter, I kept it on my tool belt and used it as I would any other tool. I can't say enough about the durability and quality of this tool."
298828,2,"Both the Shure SM57 and SM58 microphones (which, by the way, are the same internally) are considered industry workhorses. You see these things pop up everywhere, from studios to live gigs to concerts on TV. They are everywhere. Which I find a bit strange because, frankly, they don't sound good.The design of these mics goes back about 40 years. A lot has happened with microphone technology during that time. These models may have been very good decades ago, but they are really showing their age. The most prominent problem with them is the sound quality... they are quite ""honky"" making everyone sound far more nasal than they do in real life. There are some situations where that might be okay, but unless you are a vocalist who actually wants to sound more nasal than you do in reality, there are much better choices out there, as these two mics will really emphasize any honkiness/nasality of your voice.In a shootout in my studio with more than 20 different models of mics, the SM57/58 were clearly near the bottom of the list. Virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better. And I'm not talking about comparing it to $3500 Neumann U87 mics either... half of the mics we used can be had for under $150. Another, much better choice in a similar price range is the AKG D5, or you can step up to the Shure Beta 58, which is much, much better, and a microphone I can easily recommend. Both of these other mics also have better off-axis rejection and higher gain before feedback.I know that nearly everyone uses these mics, but that doesn't actually mean they are that good. There are much better choices for your money. ""Tradition"" alone isn't a great reason to buy a particular product, especially in a technology-heavy field.On the plus side, both the SM57 and SM58 are nearly bullet-proof. You can really abuse them and they'll sound just like they did when they were brand-new.Aside from the extreme durability (which is now nearly standard in similarly-priced models), the only other reason to consider an SM58 instead of another option is if you want to be the lazy sound guy that doesn't want to even try to create a proper mix and prefers to rely on the odd mid-range peak of this mic to make a vocal cut through a mix of instruments. Please take note, though, that doesn't mean that it is going to sound great... just that you'll have that odd and annoying honky peak standing out in the mix over everything else. If you like being the sound engineer that doesn't want to mess with proper mic selection and bother with equalization to create a good mix, maybe the SM57/SM58 actually are the mics for you. (Inevitably when I attend an event with a terrible mix I'll see SM58s all over the stage.) As for me and anyone else that makes sound quality and great mixes a priority, we'll probably select something else."

I've used many lights with this same design and they all have the tendecy to start slipping after some rough bumps. So I have to occasionally readjust the light. I can live with it for now, but I will eventually superglue the darn thing on there."

285150,0,"After doing the first Insanity about 2.5 times I decided I'd give the Asylum a try. I'm halfway in at the time of this writing.My primary complaint with the first Insanity is that it was really good at making my legs look and feel awesome, but my upper body and pudgy gut pretty much looked the same as the day I started my first round. A LOT of work for not enough pay off.Asylum seems to remedy this a bit by incorporating Strength and Back/Core workouts that definitely target the upper body a lot more beyond just doing pushups.So here's what I liked/didn't like:LIKED:- the Back to Core workout is probably the best back/core workout I've ever done. I have a lot of neck/back problems so usually doing most shoulder/back routines in a program is a injury kiss of death for me. This was the first one I did and actually felt pretty great afterwards. I especially like that you can exercise your abs without having to do situps or (what I consider to be worse) the v-style suspension exercises.- New improved stretches are excellent. Insanity had a good collection of stretches and they've made them even better in Asylum.- Full body focus like mentioned before without relying heavily on pushups.- GameDay is brutally hard but a bit fun and creative.- Having alternatives presented for weights, jump rope & pulls up is really niceDIDN'T LIKE:- If you thought the resting periods in Insanity were too short, you're going to be miserable in Asylum. I suppose that's fair given the difficulty increase, but at least in Insanity Shaun regularly encourages you to take breaks if your form is slipping. In Asylum he's now barking at you to always keep going and take ""2 breath"" breaks. This is injury bait, and while I realize the point is to push yourself I advise you to still take regular breaks if your form is slipping otherwise you're just begging to end up with neck/back problems like me.- Asylum is a lot harder on your body than Insanity, the routines are longer than Insanity, but yet the Warmup/Cooldown stretches are a lot shorter than they were in Insanity. This makes little sense to me. And c'mon, having me do Vertical Plyo (2nd hardest thing) the day right after GameDay (most hardest)? That's just abusive. Warmup/Cooldowns were the biggest thing I liked about Insanity since I'm never sure what I should be stretching regularly and for how long, and having it in a routine made a huge difference in keeping injury down. Reducing it seems like a big mistake to me, especially for a routine that is more aggressive. Shaun T tells you to use the Relief video if you need it afterwards, but that's an extra 20 minutes to add to 50-60 minutes (and it still doesn't address the warmup).- Like Insanity, Asylum is lacking a decent Yoga routine to help release the stress/anxiety that builds up when you're regularly beating the crap out of your body. The Relief routine comes close but mostly aims at stretching. Not saying we need to be chanting Ohms with Tony Horton here, but working towards a Savasana at the end has always done amazing things for me.EDITED Final Verdict: I ended up reducing to 3 stars after just about having enough of my body feeling like a giant sore mangled knot 17 days into the program.Worth a try ONLY if you've already done Insanity and are pretty comfortable with how far to safely push your body since Shaun T will no longer be looking out for that in this. I consider it better than Insanity personally since it's a lot more full body oriented, but the even more reduced period of recovery is just too much IMO. However I do recommend modifying it as necessary and trying to insert a yoga routine here and there, or mixing it into regular Insanity."

After watching videos online of different machines I decided on the Lee because it looked easy to use and was the most affordable - I had all but crossed it off my list until I had seen the videos. I have been really happy and impressed with the ease of use! It was so simple to setup, I was loading shells within 15-20min from opening the box, just attach the primer feed - which I HIGHLY recommend - mount it to a board, install the bushings and LOAD!I am reloading trap shells with it and its working great, even the guys at the range were impressed with the shells, they have a perfect crimp on them. Like I said, get the primer feed for sure, I have only used Federal and Cheddites in it so far, and the Fed's feed alot better, even the book says Fed's seem to work best in the feeder. But it saves alot of time and is really easy to feed primers.The shot always measures really close, like within 5-7 thousands on my scale, but with the powder I am using, Unique & Red Dot from Alliant, the bushing is a bit lighter than the numbers published but still well within range for my shells, the .155 bushing says 23 grains for Unique and 18gr for Red Dot, but I am getting, 20.5 to 21 and 17.1 to 17.5 respectively. I know that is not dead-on for guys who want total accuracy, but it works OK for me. In fact, I have been scoring better with my reloads than factory loads - I'll take that!Anyway, for beginners, I dont think you can go wrong with the Lee Load-All 2, I highly recommend it!"

374150,1,The description that these are primarily used for climbing is misleading. These foot claws should not be used to climb in the traditional sense.

They may help in ice and snow to help you from losing your footing. Overall a good product but they must be used properly.
77468,2,I could not get the product to stay on. It would turn off before you finished sighting in. The on/off mechanism is really unreliable. When you could get it to work the beam was not really strong enough for any significant distance in daylight. My summary: It's just a waste of time and money. A box of bullets works much better and will work every time.
79953,2,"This is a great rack, and it was very easy to install. It is nice that it comes with the two extenders, allowing you to install it level in many different models."
460612,2,"Like so many others have said before me...the manufacturer promises a certain size, but fell short in delivering. (The ""75cm"" printed on the side is meaningless) The first-fill effort only resulted in a 61CM diameter. I waited 24 hours to inflate to full size--as the instructions stated--possibly to let the rubber stretch a bit. It was a great work-out. The best exercize one could get with this substandard sphere is attempting to attain its full diameter. The puffy orb only measured 68CM at its maximum distention. When I placed my entire 6'3"", 205lb frame over the turgid balloon, I was afraid it was going to burst, tearing open my rib cage and splattering my bloody entrails all over our irrepleacable Safavid Persian. I might save it for New Year's Eve, placing it a safe distance from our home, where an accurate toss of a throwing knife will overpower the explosions of our neighbors' M-80's. It'll be worth the $21."
474512,1,"I have had and been using this bicycle for about 1 month. I am very satisfied with it. I am 62 years old and have had a total knee replacemnt surgery. The fan resistance works very well for my knees because it prevents the possiblity of putting a heavy load on the knee. The only way I can increase the load is by pedaling faster, which is exactly what is okay for my knees. So, may knees do not really have much impact type stress, such as running or even walking. I am not training for a marathon or anything like it. I simply want to get a good cardiac work out and want to be able to do so for the rest of my life. If you are 27 years old and want to be able to ride up a mountain, this is not the bike for you.The bike is solid and very stable. The misaligned belt problems reported by others has not been a problem for me. Assembly was really not very difficult. The assembly instructions are not the best but perfectly adequate. The problem is/was that the written instructions were composed or translated by someone who is not a native English speaker. The syntax is a bit awkard at times but the meaning was clear (for me, at least). The instruction diagram was not much use at all because it is much to small to adequately show the correct orientation or shape of smaller parts. If you read and follow the instructions carefully, you may find like me that assembly was not that difficult. I need to point out that I think I am pretty good at this sort of thing.I like the abilty to pedal with my hands/arms a lot. At times though, I wish I had a platform on which to put a book but the upper body workout is more important to me. If the bike hold ups over the next year, I would rate this as a 5 star item.I have a cardiac heart rate monitor that is able to transmit to the electronic workout monitor that comes with the bike. The bike does not have a cardiac monitor but only a receiver. The electonic workout monitor is okay for me because I am not interested in much other than RPM, calories and time and these are part of what the bike can track."
342666,0,"We've had this lamp for a long time. With the two hurricanes we have been through in 2 years it's gotten plenty of use. During Hurricane Sandy we took my mother-in-laws lamp as she has emergency lighting in her senior complex. As one reviewer mentioned it's not built rock solid but it works. The one we just inherited from Mom had a broken battery cover but we were able to get it to work with Gorilla Tape. They seem to get decent battery life. The reason I'm righting this review though is to mention to all that have this lamp and would like longer battery life and a cooler slightly brighter light is that Dorcy makes LED replacement bulbs for them for under four dollars(W/free shipping). I just upgraded our two lamps plus an old Dorcy flashlight, you know the big yellow ones with the square 6v battery. They fit perfectly and improve the lamps function IMO. You may prefer the warmer light of the original bulb but check them out. Here's a link:Dorcy 41-1644 40 Lumen 4.5 to 6 Volt LED Replacement BulbJust followed this link myself. Whoa! The price has increased over 40% since I ordered them just 10 days ago. Supply and demand at work I guess. But batteries are expensive so I guess it's still worth it. Just sayin'..."

112845,0,"I liked the shirt a lot. It's great for all sorts of outdoor activities and travel, and it made very well. However, it's tremendously over-sized. I usually wear an XXL in Columbia shirts and this fit like a 3XL. Have to return this one."
219189,0,"Coleman always make good products, they are well made and last a long time BUT What IDIOT at Coleman designed this lid is beyond me. Besides the fact that it doesn't have a clear piece in the center like it should, the actual design of this one is so impractical it doesn't deserve to be a coleman! Even with a pot holder the shape of this lid is very difficult to hold and remove while HOT! ARGH!If you are a camper, even though the rest of this pot is great & solid and it makes a great cup of coffee.. yes the strainer is flimsy, but they all are for the most part and they still hold up; go with the bigger pot with the correct lid type. For me, it's only my husband and I, which is why this size was perfect and the other is too big. Its just frustrating, I expect more from coleman."
402664,0,"The sword it self if just fine for the amount paid but thesheath is very inferior, basically cardboard and tape. It broke almost immediately with no rough treatment at all. If it is possible to obtain a better sheath for this sword that would be good, even if we have to purchase it.Thank You, Charlie D'Accardo"
380969,2,I like all the features and find the steps to be accurate but it is bulky to wear. The clip secures low making it top heavy and it leans forward and shows under clothes. I am use to a very small unintrusive clip-on but this is big. It pops off as it leans and if not for the strap I would have dropped it a few times. If you can just put it in a pocket (which is a great feature) it may be good but I don't always have one so I quit weaning it after 2 weeks. Good device just to big for me.
128525,0,"I was very happy with the fit and feel of these bibs. They do seem to run small, I ordered one size larger than I needed and they fit well. However, after less than 10 rides the seam on the chamois has started to come apart. I also bought a pair of Silverline roubaix bib shorts and they are having the same problem, the chamois seam has come apart after just a few rides."

333602,2,"A friend and I shared the cost of these so that we had something to practice with on campus, and since we are very inexperienced we decided to choose these for the sponge coat, so if we got it, perhaps it wouldnt hurt as bad. Yes, we are dumb.Anyways, upon receiving this (which by the way, came with no order records in the box) they felt of a decent weight, easy enough to swing and maneuver, and we were kind of excited to go about and practice with them.A day later when we actually did get to, we went to our racquetball court here on campus, and laid down some mats, incase we used special footwork or takedown moves, and began. First swing in which our 'swords' contacted, mine snaps in half, and it wasn't even too strong of an impact.Kind of annoyed we pulled it apart to find that the wood core inseide the sword looks much like near rotten wood found in old fenceposts, shaped into a sword. I could literally break peices off with my fingers.So we just wasted $30 (shipping included) on something that lasted less than 2 practical minutes. I kept fighting with my half-sword, and he with his full. Next hit or so, his broke.Moral, these may feel decent and sturdy from the outside, but the wood on the inside is some of the worst I've ever see composing anything."
216332,0,"When these breeches arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the fit was pretty good. I'm only 4'11"" and the 28's weren't too long and didn't bag too much in the knees (common when you're shorter with breeches!). However, after riding in them a bit, I wish they had a bit more give in the fabric to conform to my body. Once on my horse, I had to really pull on them to adjust the legs upward for a comfortable ride. I just didn't get enough give in the crotch to make them comfy enough, though I think they fit well when standing! Perhaps I just need to break these in more, but I'll have to wait for the cool weather as the synthetic full seat is also a bit sweat inducing. Granted I rode in an indoor arena, when it was probably over 85, but I don't have as much of a pooling sweat issue in my seat when I wear a cotton breech. I think with a bit more riding time in these and cooler weather, they'll be good though. They seem extremely well made so could stand up to some washing for a more worn feel. Then, these will probably be among my favorites for cool weather riding!"
465470,0,"Okay, when I first received the machine assembly was VERY easy. I used it for about and hour, and the wheels on the seat became wobbly and started sticking. I contacted Stamina Products via email, and they quickly sent me new wheels, saying there was a manufacturing defect with the old ones. No problem. The machine is smooth and easy to use, but the seat is VERY uncomfortable. I feel it needs extra padding. After 20 min. of use I usually have to stop and give my butt a break. The foot pedals are near to impossible to keep your feet in, which can be very annoying when trying to have a smooth workout. I can't complain too much, considering how little I paid. I'm fairly happy with it, it doesn't take up a lot of room and it's great for a quick anytime workout."
242073,1,"I've worn several different pairs of shorts like these adidas ones here for 15+ years playing soccer. I put these shorts through hell, sliding and so forth, and the shorts stay in good condition. Excellent stitching, quite comfortable, color doesn't fade or wither after hundreds or thousands of washes.i've even worn pairs of these while camping, getting them caught on twigs and so forth out in the woods. Fabric gets a little frayed, but nothing serious. these shorts are in excellent shape and i will purchase only adidas until the company goes out of business."
366088,2,I bought this light because I needed a light that would allow me to see the road without street lights (I live in a rural neighborhood). I am very disappointed with this light. The light dissipates to fast. The only way I can see the road is if I point the light directly in front of my front tire. If I point the light in front of me a little ways so that I can ride instead of walk the light dissipates very fast and I can see very little. This light might be fine if you want to be seen but if you want to see get something els.
139611,1,This my second Gripmaster. A set of Ruff Caps completes this to make a excellent practice tool for when you're away from your guitar for any length of time. The Gripmaster/Ruff Caps helps to build and maintain finger strength and callus'. I also have the heavy tension Gripmaster and alternate between tools. I've purchased the X-Light tensions grips for my son to build on. The other adjustable grips just don't do the job or stand up to heavy usage. It can go into your pocket and go anywhere with you. I use it at home and at work without any trouble.This is a very good tool for any beginner or seasoned guitar player.The only reson I didn't give a rating of five stars is you have to purchase the Ruff Caps seperately.
278886,0,"I have the 80 lb pistol crossbow with the self cocking handle. These things shoot awesome and fast! I'm shooting at a wood box made of something like white or yellow pine. These things stick into the wood about an inch -- hard to get out. I'd say 90% of the time the back plastic part pops off and breaks. A few times I was able to use a arrow a second time, but even then I was wary because the impact of the arrow with the wood had made the aluminum arrow slightly curved, this happened every time. I guess I should shoot into something softer like a Styrofoam target or something. One time i missed and this thing went right through a metal cabinet which was probably like the thickness of a gym locker. Had to open the cabinet and look for it inside. Another time I hit a cement cinder block and the arrow took a nice big deep chunk out of it."
382531,0,"This chair is easy to carry, either by the handle or as a backpack.It holds quite a bit of gear in its pocket and has a handy drink holder. It would be better if the chair could have one more upright adjustment. It leans back a little too much in its most upright position. The pillow that is attached hangs too far down and needs to be manually raised so that it is in a comfortable place. There is a seam at the back of the seat that is a bit annoying. I feel that this chair could have been designed better."
431198,2,"Was looking for a dartboard, with a cabinet for our basement game area. The product was price right. Upon receipt of the dartboard and unpacking, I realized that I had purchased a bad product. The unit came unassembled and what was really bad was the cabinet, with only staples to hold it together. I had to drill holes and screw it together. Was one of the worst products that I have ever purchased on line."

Now that I am fully recovered I use a heart monitor with a strap because of my increased activity. I now use this watch when I go to work and I check my heart rate while I am using the stairs instead of the elevator, or if I am doing a brisk walk during my lunch break. It is very simple to use."

411893,0,The burner came packaged nicely. The only problem was the actual burner is held on by 2 small tack welds which either broke in transit or were not properly tack welded from factory. So now I need to take it to a buddy's house to get it welded. Not worth the hassle and waste of money reshipping it for a new one. It looks great and hopefully my experience is just a random one. I would probably recommend it to a friend but only because I know that if something happened to it we can weld it or whatever needs to be done. If someone isnt very handy or have the correct tools I would probably recommend shopping around and doing a thorough review of products available before buying this one. Like I said though I probably got the unlucky one out of a thousand.
289301,0,"This review is purposely for people who are looking to buy this to study/read. I have not tried these at the shooting range yet, and will give it a better rating if it works well there.PRO: I specifically bought these so I could study and read without being bothered by my loud computer, noisy roommates, thumping sounds from the apt above me, and the bass from my roommate's music. For blocking out those noises I give it a 5/5. It blocks out all sound and I can read in peace.CON: I give it a 4 because it is so uncomfortable. If you have a medium sized head it feels like someone is squeezing your head. And after 30 minutes the side of your head/ears start to hurt pretty bad. Even though I have it pulled out on the widest setting.Another bad thing is adjusting it to fit your head. It is made out of a cheap metal and plastic which you slide up and down for each ear muff separately. I don't know if it's just mine but it's hard to slide up and down and I feel like I'm going to break it.Other thoughts: It feels like your under water when you wear it. For the price, I think it was well worth trying, but I would not buy this one again."

340989,0,"The pedometer does what it is designed to do...keep track of your steps for the day (and for the past 7 days) which is why I bought it. It comes with a lanyard to keep from losing it and it works well! Set it up to match your stride and it converts steps to miles, etc. The only part I am concerned about is durability...the little piece that plugs the top came off in the first week never to be seen again! Hasn't effected the operation whatsoever but am concerned about dirt and water getting in and the day it ups and stops! I am outdoors most of the time so time will tell. It's a good piece for the price."

351530,0,"This light set is a good deal for an occasional rider as a starter light set, or for a backup or extra set.The headlight: First thing to realize: It is not designed to illuminate the road while traveling at any significant speed. It is designed for city riding with the purpose of making you visible to other vehicles. The brightness is excellent, but the mount is insecure, the body seems unnecessarily large, and the top of the light shines back in your face (but this can be fixed with a bit of black tape).The taillight: Very well designed overall. Very bright and good side illumination. However, the light should not require a tool to open. The screws on the light are smaller than standard bicycle parts and require a jewelers' screwdriver to remove."
157019,0,"This helmet misled me about certain aspects of its design with the picture that was posted. By the picture it appears that the visor of the helmet will come out at your eyebrow line so as to effectively block sun. This is false however, as the visor is actually placed 3 inches above the bottom rim of the helmet which not only looks aesthetically absurd, but does not block the sun at all. The visor was an important element of the helmet for me and having it come out at my hairline does not work.Otherwise the helmet fits well and is appropriately adjustable so if the visor and aesthetics are not important to you this helmet will work fine."
365936,0,"The quality of the helmet and pads was good. But the sizing information was way off. It was supposed to be a men's medium/large but was a youth size instead...not clear at all when I ordered.

140764,0,"One major flaw in this program is that it does not allow you to designate whether you are left or right handed. This makes it difficult in some of the sports, like tennis. In addition, the program is too sensitive to the position of the WII remote and nunchuck. If you are a fraction off in pointing the device, the game halts till you correct it. If you have small hands, like I do, it is difficult to hold the WII remote in an exact position. Also, you cannot choose the eye color when you put together your likeness so if you have blue eyes, the likeness is not going to look at all like you."

He has yet to spend the holidays or his wedding anniversary at home with his new wife.Two days after I placed the order, I received an email from Amazon saying that my order had been canceled. There was no other explanation (and it was not for reasons related to my payment). ShoeMall is still offering the same socks, size, and color for sale on Amazon. Shame on ShoeMall!!

470146,0,"First let me say that this is a great cardio machine. You do get a decent workout and it's better (and cheaper) over time than driving to a work out facility. For the most part this machine is made well, BUT after yesterday's workout (and for the 2nd time within 15 months of having it initially repaired for the same thing), it broke down again. The problem being a pivot bolt (about 6 inch's long) that holds the upper arm and pedal assembly and also is a foot rest if doing upper resistance only. This pivot bolt is screwed into the frame assembly and obviously deals with the pressure of motion when peddling. What happened was the bolt on the left side broke/cracked (right side has been previously repaired). The break is where this pivot bolt is screwed into the frame and the unit has to be taken to an authorized repair shop to be drilled out and replaced. Don't try this yourself as the bolt is made of case hardened steel (I tried). The machine is heavy and bulky and you better have at least a minivan or light truck to transport it (I have a PT Cruiser). Repair will be at least $75.00 each time this happens. Luckily the repair shop is less than 10 miles away, but now I'll have to wait a week to work out. Also let me mention that I use this almost everyday for over four years. Other than this issue, the machine is a five star product."

297480,0,"This is a good exercise book, with an unrealistic food plan. I really felt that the author wrote the book from her heart, and what she believes will work. I don't like the word perfection in the title. I don't believe anyone can define what a perfect body really is.I like the mat exercises,and the cardio part is fun. I do think it will get a little bit boring doing the same cardio routines every day. I feel as a chiropractor, and fitness trainer, the exercises are safe and challenging. I don't agree with doing the workout routines everyday. I think the body requires rest days in between workouts.I think the dietary recommendations are too extreme. There is not enough protein in the plan. Even though the food choices are very healthy, I don't think there is enough food to sustain a woman, who is working, and doing an hour and a half workout each day. I think if you follow this dietary program you are setting yourself up to overeat when the 30 days are over. I started to get anxiety just thinking about how little I could eat, and all the time it would take to prepare most of the meals and snacks."
297505,0,"Given the choice between a leisurely jog through the park on a crisp, sunny, fall day and staying in bed with the latest biography and a venti skim latte, I will choose the book and coffee every time. Moreover, I am a carboholic: pasta, bread, cakes, and cookies, I love them all! Yes, I am a true couch potato. I say this not to brag, but to acknowledge what I am. I know my personal preferences are not a winning combination for long term health and fitness. And I want to change --- really I do. So when the opportunity came along to review Tracy Anderson's 30-Day Method I jumped on it.Tracy Anderson, a personal trainer to celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow and Courtney Cox, has written a plan for getting in shape in a month's time. According to Anderson:""The Method works for everyone, hands down. So what'll you find in my book is my 30-Day Method: a complete program with a cardio routine, plus new mat exercise sequences every ten days to keep your accessory muscles focused and at attention. You'll lose the fat and tone your muscles. And once you add in the 30-Day eating plan, you'll really see results!With statements like that my interest was definitely piqued. I also liked that the 30-Day Method has lots of pictures of the muscle toning exercises; a cardio companion dvd for the dance aerobics, and a detailed meal plan (one for meat eaters and the other for vegetarians, but both unfortunately lack calorie counts). This all sounded very promising, but also a little intimidating too. While I wanted to ease into making healthier eating choices and incorporate a sustainable exercise plan into my life, the 30-Day Method is all or nothing - there is no room for deviations. As Anderson declares, it is her way or the highway. For me, I am looking for a long term plan that I can grow with and maintain. If, however, you are willing to commit completely to Anderson's program, or at a higher level of fitness than I am, I have no doubt that you will see results.The 30-Day Method is an intensive, detailed plan for getting into shape!Review copy provided courtesy of the publisher."

The cover is washable too, but don't put it in the dryer.I've given these to expectant mothers and always receive an enthusiastic thank you. They help the mommies-to-be get comfortable.This is too thick for pranayama. If you want a bolster for that, get the standard one. But I do recommend this product wholeheartedly."
20579,0,"I was looking for some ak rails for chistmas. I saw many items that looked like they would fit my ak, but then I saw the AK Receiver Cover Tri-RailL Weaver Scope Mount, and I thought that this would be the better buy because it had three rails insted of one, two rals like the other products. on chistmas morrning I opened it and tryed to put it on. It didn't work, I tryed for hours to attempted to put the rails on. it didn't fit because the very end of the body(the thingy that the rails are on) it has a shape sort of like a triangle, my aks origenal thing that was replaced for the rails has a smoothed curved peace insted of a triangl shaped end. and it was about a 8th of an inch short so it didn't fit. but still since it didn't fit I had to glue all around the rail so it would stay on. I rated it 3 stars because the discriptions of it said that it fit on aks but it didn't, but it still works good, but I had to glue my hop up to keep the rail on."

396597,2,"Judging from the photo here, Bell got enough complaints about the completely non-functional ""spring suspension (on the one I bought 5 years ago)"" that they changed it, so maybe on the current incarnation of this saddle, the springs actually WORK.

446010,1,I enjoy endurance type athletic events and my days are filled with crossfit oriented training sessions. I have used these shorts in multiple events and they have never been a problem--in fact I own 4 or 5 of them in different colors. You can do 20+ mile running sessions and the shorts will dry out fairly quickly. I recommend these for any serious athlete.
11524,1,Although the product is great. It was not the exact color as published. It does not have a different color on the neck
66659,1,"If you're like me, you probably want some decent shorts to run/ball it up/do whatever in, but you don't really want to go around looking like Daisy Duke. So here you go. I bought the XXL size, although XL is probably my actual size. I'd say that they definitely aren't overly baggy for me.For some reason, I've also become kind of sick of school logos on the shorts. These plain ones show off a little more of your post-modern sensibilities.Two small nits: 1) They are maybe a very slight bit too long- even a little bit off the length would probably help with the air circulation down in the important areas (but like I said, I ain't no Catherine Bach). 2) I used to like the older mesh with the slightly larger holes in it. I feel (and my feelings may not at all comport with reality) that the new finer mesh doesn't seem to breathe quite as well."
333738,1,"First off, I love this device. It's small, elegant, looks great on the bike and is easy to use and read. Why not five stars? Well, because it is a bear to set up and calibrate. Whoever wrote the directions must have been on drugs. I almost threw it in the trash a few times, but I persevered.This unit doesn't have cadence and I don't think that's a big deal. Anyone who has ridden over a few hundred miles knows their cadence so I don't miss it.For what it is, it's great. Just take a valium before setting it up!"
509100,0,"These are nicely styled compared to what is available as hiking shorts in any local stores. My only complaint is the use of velcro to hold the pockets closed. It is necessary to 'peel' your pockets open thus, it takes two hands to put your wallet back in the pocket. Try doing that while sitting in your car. Otherwise, nice shorts."

6867,2,"My son and some of his fiends each bought one of these about a month ago. They love the boards and use them to get around the neighborhood after school. The problem: the soft rubber wheels wear out after about a month or so of use. This makes the board difficult to ride and essentially rendered my son's board useless in just 4 weeks.We checked with the store that sold us The Wave to see if they sold replacement wheels but found out that replacements are not available at this time. The store took a look at the wheels and was kind enough to replace the entire board for my son. My son's friend has a similar problem with his board and will likely need to replace his as well.According to my son, he uses The Wave to zip around the neighborhood (suburban Long Island, NY) with an occassional curb hop but is not performing any heavy duty tricks or anything else you would not expect to do on a skateboard.The bottom line: A cool board but not very durable. At $100 it should last longer than a month."
509790,0,"Upon delivery by UPS, I noticed the box torn and taped at one end. I assumed something would be missing and it was (a nut used to keep the oars open, and in place) so until I get another, the machine is useless.Next, I when I opened the box, i noticed how poorly packaged everything is. Some cardboard that was supposed to be between the metal parts have shifted and everything was rubbing against each other. Thank goodness there were not too many scratches. Finally, the instructions were for the most part in German with some English, it was easier to follow the illustrations and parts numbers to assemble. Of course if anything can go wrong it will, and the oars are not marked as left or right and fit perfectly on the wrong side! I had to dissasemble to bolts holding the oars, the shocks and move from one side to the other. It seems to be a well built machine, but won't know for sure until I find a suitable nut to lock the arm in place"
58232,0,"I needed to order these shorts for my daughter to fit requirements of a fitness program she was going through. They fit her a little shorter than pictured on the manaquin (why don't they use real people in these pictures?), and so they didn't meet the requirements.Material is just your basic, thin stuff. But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her. I'm glad they are now using a read model. They held up for a few months before they ripped. They served their purpose."
183877,1,"I bought this T-shirt for a good friend of mine. He likes to wear thicker T-shirts with a pocket. We live in a state that has lots of rain and cold weather. He likes this shirt a lot and the quality is very good. I was concerned that this shirt may not be big enough but it fit him perfectly. He wears it under his shirts and of course when the sun does come out and warms up, he has a T-shirt that looks nice.Washing and drying this shirt was easy and it did not shrink like some cotton shirts do. It kept it's shape and is made of a thicker softer cotton.The pocket is important to him for his pens etc., and for the price, he felt this is a T-shirt that he will want more of and in different colors. This purchase was a white T-shirt.The seller sent this T-shirt in record time so I will buy from this site again."

100947,1,"Well made biking tool. Light & compact, it is easily carried on the bike. I wire-tied it to the frame via the included neoprene case. I really only need two of the tools so didn't want the more common mega-tool. This one is as small as I could find. The steel tools are hard enough that they won't deform and the aluminum frame is stout enough to resist twisting."
402223,0,"I had read a negative review prior to ordering and frankly exactly the same problem happened. Product arrived in a box totally destroyed. The frame was not damaged, but half the nuts and bolts were missing. I called Amazon and told them about the problem and that I would keep the item and purchase nuts and bolts myself. They reimbursed me $30 to cover my car gas and the nuts and bolts. Outstanding response by Amazon, but the manufacturer has a real problem with shipping."
507188,0,"I bought this a while ago. I've used it to strengthen the muscles along my shins. It helped but I figured out better exercises that do not require this -- such as toe taps, just flexing the toes up, duck walks, or using elastic bands.This thing is well constructed and great if you are planning to load tons of weight. But for what I needed it for -- preventing shin splints -- it is not worth it.It is heavy, awkward to carry around, and overly expensive. This is like a $40 contraption at most in my opinion."
228520,1,My son loves these leggings. This is his second set. He rides a bike to work in all types of weather. A 30 mi round trip.
43287,1,I like someone who knows what they do. This vest was sensibly designed with fuctions and economy in mind. I would keep buying this vest year after year for its design and price. All the pockets are optimally placed for outdoor persons. Again good product.
153279,1,Pros:-Stylish two-toned design-Includes three quality tackle boxes-Shoulder strap frees up both hands-Two elastic water bottle holdersCons:-Vertical tackle boxes get disorganized
118615,1,I bought this for my husband and it ended up better than what we expected. He was very happy with this product. Not only was it perfect but they shipped it out and the next day it arrived here!! A+
211452,2,"Sorry to say, that I was very dissapointed with this sale. You can read in my order that says ""With DVD."" The DVD was not included and I was not interested in the book at all. So I had to return the book.Thank you anyhow, as I am always pleased with Amazon, especially with the service - Whispernet- you provide to my Kindle."
89583,0,"An adequate product that will get the job done. The seating material is a little thin, will likely be the first thing to deteriorate. Assembly wasn't difficult, although you need to be sure to just barely put in all of the screws on the back of the seat before tightening any of them down too far as the holes are not aligned well. One of the connections on the base was not threaded properly, so I just went for the gusto and all seems to be working so far.I am pleased that I decided to go for the 5.1 bench over the 3.1 version. The extra incline positions and leg attachment are worth it if this is you only piece of gym equipment (besides some free weights).As others commented, my packaging was delivered pretty roughed up (by no fault of the carrier). Bowflex really skimped on the cardboard--really cheap stuff--and it seemed like many of the components probably shifted around, breaking up the box from the inside-out."

47847,1,"I had looked all through the stores trying to find a yoga kit that included blocks, straps and a mat and couldn't find anything that had all three. The price of buying them seprately was double the price of this kit. I was worried about the mat quality, but it very good, with no odor. Considering buying a second to keep in the car for going to the gym and have the original at home for videos."
156936,0,The entire set is OK. Some of the balls do not have numbers printed on them very well. Had to go over them with markers and they don't look at good as they should. some of the cards do not work....red slider appears to be inserted crooked and will not cover the numbers.

176095,0,The tank is great except for the fact that fuel seeps out from the four screws that hold the fuel level gauge assembly to the tank... not a huge ammount but enough to aggravate me. I will eventually have to remove the assembly after running the tank dry and apply some gas resistent sealer to solve the issue. Kinda disappointing.
452320,1,"In preparation for walking the breast cancer 3-day, I hunted high and low for the perfect hydration pack. I really like this one- its comfortable, and has storage for keys, ipod, sunscreen, etc. I really can't think of any downsides to this product. I recommend it!"
329427,0,"Bought these as an experiment. Living in Northern Maine where the temperature drops below zero an average of forty times per year I was anxious to see what the manufacturer believes is &#34;cold&#34;. After several outings with just these gloves under a variety of conditions and temperatures, here's what I can say.1) They are completely waterproof and the long stretchable material covers well above the wrist. This is good.2) If you work outside in temps above freezing, these gloves will hold up well and keep your fingers moderately comfortable.3) At temperatures below freezing, they do not keep your fingers warm. Tested at temperatures in the mid teens Fahrenheit while working on a car, my fingers got painfully cold after fifteen minutes. On a walk with temperatures below zero I needed to put on warmer gloves after less than five minutes. An advantage of the stretchable material and long length is you can tuck your fingers into the palm and your fingers should stay reasonably warm. The waterproof material also inhibits the wind.Bottom line: If you work outside in temps in the thirties and forties, these gloves should be great. Below that, they are good as a liner for a pair of mittens where, when necessary, you can remove the mittens and do what needs doing with these gloves as sufficient short term protection."

506308,1,"Finally, we got what we wanted. Not Midway, but acclaim. Not nba street volume 2, but NBA JAM! IT features everything, over 200 different dunks, and over 500 different moves and motions.I mean what more could you want. Superstars flying 50 ft. into the air. Its awesome! Its got all the correct rosters, and you whats even better! Their are some realistic moves, like dribbling behind your back and just running. THats pretty realistic, is it not. Everyone complains about how hard the CPU is, their not hard. SUre, if you want a game thats going to take you now more then 2-3 days, this games not the game for you, but if you want a game in reward for your money, its going to take you about 2-3 months. And its not like you cant figure out where to go or anything, and you get all stressed out. If you know the moves and practice them over and over and over and over again in exhibition mode, it'll be a piece of Boomshakalaka in the NBA Jam tournement. One word to sum it all up.Boomshakalakalakalakalakalakalaka!!!!"

The bodysuit is not true to size (it is not long enough, even though the size i purchased is usually too big for my son) and the pants ""pilled"" after one wash, so they look very old.

19754,1,"We had originally purchased a tent from a Big-Box store for family camping and Cub Scout campouts. That tent lasted 2 campouts before the tent stake loops ripped 2 holes in the floor. We decided to invest more money into a quality tent. The Columbia tent was easy to set up, plus the cargo doors and vent openings add a lot of value. The zippers on the rainfly were very useful in ventilation. Remember the old saying, ""You get what you pay for""!"
191515,0,"Just got back from a 3 day camping trip with this bag. I purchased this bag because I was on a tight budget and the pack offered features (like built in rainfly) that are only found in more expensive packs. I also needed a smaller pack that would be better suited for my petite wife or twelve year old.Upon arrival, I found the weight of the bag noticiably heavier than more expensive internal frame packs. When I tested the clasps, they worked, but I didn't feel the crisp snap I get from higher-end bags. I found the stiching, zippers, and fabric comparable to more expensive bags.The bag performed well during the trip. It did not sit in a car trunk, but was carried on back for a three hour trip from subway to rail to hike. It accomodated four sleeping bags (two external), one blanket, a small fishing rod, two rolls of toilet paper, two rolls of paper towels, toiletries, and a host of other small items.On the return portion of the trip, the adjustable back/shoulder velcro adjustment came loose and had to be readjusted. The real problem came when unpacking. The plastic clasp would not squeeze in all the way and release. I checked to see if there were something lodged in between the clasp, but nothin was found. I eventually had to use a small screwdriver pry in the clasp so it would open. I retested the clasp works fine (and it works fine, for now. I do expect have the problem again because the clasps ae just not well made.So, do I regret my purchase? No. For $49 it's a pretty good deal. Just expect to fiddle with the clasps from time to time, and don't expect the bag to be ultra lite."
153687,2,"The compression shorts I bought from Safe-T-Gard were the least expensive ones available, but that price comes with a catch, actually 2 catches. The first one is that although they fit right in every other way, these shorts are uni-sex styling, a fact omitted in the product description but clearly displayed on the package. Now they may fit right for females, but there's just no room for my junk in these drawers. That leads to the second catch, that although I wrote the seller an e-mail asking to rectify the situation, I received no reply.All told, I'd have to say: shop for a quality product that fits, from a supplier that will support their customers."
183993,0,"I bought this because it came up in a search for ""leather gun belt"".As other have noted, it is sized tight. As a belt, it is a well made leather belt and as such has value.

506627,0,"I'll start with the good things:This poker table top is relatively affordable, and it's definitely portable (it folds up into fourths and fits into a carrying case). It has built-in holders for each player's chips and drink, which is nice.Now for the bad stuff:1. The entire table top appears to be made of some sort of thick cardboard or flimsy pasteboard, so it flexes a lot and if anyone is resting their elbows on an unsupported part of the poker table top, it can actually bend and maybe even break.2. All of the writing on the table (including the big words embossed in the middle) are actually made out of a rubbery raised material, which means cards and even chips are always getting caught up on it instead of sliding smoothly across the felt. This is extremely annoying.3. The table top folds into quarters, so when you un-fold it, instead of having a smooth and level playing surface, you have a divided surface (not everything lines up exactly level), which also contributes to the whole card sliding problem.4. No raised border. This means that if you toss a card to someone and it lands just right, it's possible for it to slide right off the edge of the table. This really isn't that big of a deal (if you know how to throw cards), but I thought I should mention it, since a lot of players who use this table are most likely going to be casual players (not professional card dealers)."

313828,1,"As a marathoner, student and volunteer, my lifestyle demands products that are durable, useful, and flexible. This little bottle fits all three requirements. I have used KleenCanteen, Nalgenes, Camelpak, and all the other top brands for water bottles, but this one seems to better the rest with flying colors.First, it is constructed of a durable plastic that is resistant to punctures. Second, it is able to contain as much fluid as these other containers while still being more compact than all of them. Third, it is very active-friendly, it is able to fold down and deflate to a pocketable size. Fourth, it is extremely easy to fill anywhere because of the flexible nature of the bottle itself. All of these pros make this bottle a great choice. The price tag is also a very convincing factor, considering the fact that most other brands are pricing their products in the $20s and $30s.While I don't think this is a great option for actual sporting, unless you get the bite-valve, this works just fine for any on-the-go demands of life."

484626,0,"For the price, I shouldn't really expect much. For the brand, I sort of expected more. I primarily bought this to put into an EDC case as a small, convenient cover-all type tool. Because of travels, I had planned on removal of the knife blade, a simple T8 fastener is all that holds it in place.The remainder of the tool is sub-par, but will passably do the job if needed. I am surprised at the shoddy workmanship, design and execution of a relatively-popular tool. I am planning on keeping the tool as it ""works"" and essentially does what it's supposed to. I wish I had seen one in person in a store before purchasing. I'm not one of those people who picks apart products based on made up characteristics, or unrealistic expectations, but just a realist giving honest feedback.Of the items poorly designed:1) Belt clip/carabiner - a tremendous amount of slop in the jaw at the pivot point. So much that it actually won't self-latch at times. Not a big deal in my case, but still shoddy design and workmanship.2) The adjustment for the wrench head/jaw has a lot of play between the gears of the bottom jaw and the adjuster screw. It's just a subpar design with poorly manufactured/sourced components. This is a real disappointment for me, as this is half the tool functionality for me.3) Several of the screws were stripped in the assembly process. The main screw holding the wrench adjustment mechanism was clearly overtightened and stripped, damaging the case. As were the tiny Torx belt clip screws.4) The LED light is very poor. Whatever the lumen output, it's a nominal difference above just letting one's eyes adjust to the environment. A single match puts out more light.5) The tool caddy for the four included bits has no mechanism by which to hold the bits in place (other than friction). The result is inevitable bit loss.On the plus side:1) The knife is sharp and stays that way.2) The tool caddy is magnetic.3) The tool itself is overall small, but the body is substantial enough to give weight and strength.The bottom line: for me, it's a $25 poorly designed small adjustable wrench and hex bit driver. If you are considering one of these, I'd highly recommend trying to see one in person before committing to buying. There are probably other tools out there which can accomplish the same things, or a collection of small implements may do the same thing in a better executed fashion."

324917,1,This sword is an excellent value for the price. It has definitely surpassed my expectations in this price range. Cold Steel has a wide variety of swords ranging from low to fairly high quality. I would rate this sword in the middle. The sword is manufactured in India and comes with a British Proof Test Certificate. If you are looking for a good Dirk for your collection...this one would be difficult beat.
34566,1,"The cones are great to have for a variety of functions. I use them regularly to set up end zones to the mark the field for ultimate frisbee games and to set up drills for agility training.A big positive about the cones is that they stack on each other for convenient storage. Also, they are very resilient and durable.The only possible negative is that the profile is low. From far away, the visibility of the cones is not so great."
51412,0,"A well designed product that is an excellent, INEXPENSIVE solution to a raised airbed for sleeping guests from time to time. It fits the raised, queen-sized air bed perfectly and its' price makes it very attractive. It is also very easy to store (comes in its' own bag) and ship.The only drawback: it's not very warm. You'll definitely need an extra blanket or two with this.....unless it's hot outside.Overall....a good purchase."

483876,0,"Since I've got a lot of water filter/purifiers, I feel I can safely and objectively compare my experience with them in reviewing this Vario. For sure, it's a little heavier and bulkier than say, a Hiker Pro. At it's best, it works great. At it's worst...well, more about that later.First the pros and cons;Pro;1. It can pump fast and with only mild effort. The bidirectional pump action can really move the water, especially if you have it setup to bypass the ceramic disk.2. I love the threaded bottle adapter built in to the base. Very nice if you're used to trying to balance everything on rocks!3. The charcoal bit removes most unpleasant flavors. Mind you, if the water really smells horrible to start with, you're limited with what the charcoal can do.4. Good instructions, packaging, decent carry bag, little tube of silicon lubricant is a nice touch from a reputable company.Cons:1. It can refuse to start pumping. The wonderful piston/valve assemblies that move so much water can 'air-lock' and stop pumping. And it can take quite a bit of voodoo/fiddling to get it pumping again.2. Any filter with a ceramic portion needs a silt pre-filter to prevent clogging. This one is no exception. (A silt pre-filter will also greatly extend the life of the pleated paper filter cartridge.)3. The fragile plastic inlet barb sticks out awkwardly toward the back and is very unprotected. I suspect it's no accident that the inlet barb is always positioned where it can't be seen in the product photos and videos.4. In my experienced opinion, I believe there is a design flaw in the flow path. On the bottom of the paper filter there is an o-ring that separates the contaminated water from the filtered water output. (Which also comes out the bottom.) If that o-ring were nicked, damaged, or missing, contaminated water would leak directly to the output stream. Of course, if the o-ring is kept in perfect shape, this wouldn't happen...but I tend to think in 'worst-case' rather than 'best-case'. That's one of the reasons I filter my water rather than drinking it directly from a stream.Conclusion;In short, when it works it works great. It would probably be best for world travelers who could protect the fragile inlet barb and who wouldn't expose the filter to too much grit or silt.If you're wanting to use it backpacking, I'd recommend a simpler, more robust design.One last thought:More of a tip really. If you have one of these, you'll note they protect the inlet barb during shipping with a red plastic cover cap. While you certainly can use that red plastic piece to cap the barb when traveling, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you NOT try to pump the handle with the red protective cap still on. There are little rubber 'valves' in the pump that can potentially be damaged while trying to pump too hard against a vacuum."
306845,1,"This is a very good product, very strong. the quality is O.K. also It lasts longer than those other Tees i had before. Nice"
186815,1,Overall the transaction was easy no issues; item shipped and arrived as stated. It works well and makes a good cushion to sit on. The only reason I do not give it a 5 is the flotation is made of five individual pierces of foam and not one. This allows water to get in between the pieces of foam and it stays wet much longer after use. also caused it to loose its shape once a little bit.

278796,2,"The HeadShield will be overkill for most paintball players. For one thing, it gets hot under a mask anyway, and a helmet is twice as bad because the hot air under the helmet has nowhere to go, causing your mask to fog up faster. Also, helmets tend to be harder to adjust and put on. Finally, after a few times playing, you will usually get enough situational awareness to avoid getting shot in the back of the head anyway.The JT HeadShield is actually a mask with a helmet attachment. Rather than a single band to adjust tightness, now we have to make sure the helmet part is aligned correctly. One of the securing fasteners is smack on top of the head, which is quite painful if your head fills the entire space. Also, to put it on you have to put your chin to the chin of the mask and fold the mask over your head (think how Darth Vader's mask works in Return of the Jedi). If you wear glasses, like I do, this is next to impossible to do with your glasses on (which you kind of need to see while you play, I assume).However, once the helmet portion is removed, the mask itself is decent (essentially aJT Elite), though it only has a single untreated lens (big thumbs down) and that little silver piece over the mouthguard (unnecessary but aesthetically pleasing) will tend to come off after one or two rough games.Consider the helmet if you play speedball and get bunkered regularly, but my advice is to stick with a regular mask."

488252,1,"This is a great entry level gun. lots of upgrades available. well packaged. shipped etc.Pros:The gun came in two pieces and was very easy to put together, The bipod wobbles a bit but it can be tightened, i find this to be a pro because i want to be able to tip/turn the gun without the bipod falling off the stump im shooting over so some give is good.I cant really give any cons as my problems with it are to be expected but i will list what i dislike.1) The cocking arm for the gun is on the right hand side, So i cant see this being a left side dominate persons pick, But the Carry Strap brackets go through the gun and are on both sides, I dislike this because when im calking the gun my right arm has caught on the strap hook and scratched me, This isnt a big deal as these are easy to remove/grind down/reattach.2) This gun IS an Entry Level gun. The first time i shot it we put an upgraded spring/piston/cap into it ($70 value) it was second hand so i cant tell you exact details about it but Pre-Upgraded it shot at 415fps with .25g Matrix BBS, Post-Upgrade it shot 415fps with .40g Madbull BBS. We adjusted the hopup and sighted it in and were getting torso size groupings at 150ft.This was not good enough for me, This gun shoots 1 round every 5seconds depending on the shooter vs my M15 that shoots 15 RPS, i need better accuracy and range to make a Bolt Action worth my time in a full scale game (10+ vs 10+). When looking into it it was often said taht the Hopup for this gun is insuffecient, It is a cheap replica gun with a cheap replica hopup, To replace this was approx $60 to a PDI Hopup with Vertical and Horizontal Adjustment. to upgrade to a Tightbore Barrel was $125 for a PDI 6.01mm full length Inner Barrel. and an Fluted PDI outer barrel was $160.The PDI Hopup is generally considered the standard and nothing else is really recommended regardless of price range.The PDI Inner/Outer Barrels are Top end and considered the best but a lower quality/priced generic will siffice.Due to my Spring upgrade it was also VERY STRONGLY recommended getting a zero trigger set for the gun, This is a high quality steel reinforced Trigger set. This was another $200.Overall this gun is a entry level gun. but if you are like me and are OCD about getting the most out of everything you do i would recommend just getting a nicer gun to begin with and saving yourself the trouble. With this you wont get pinpoint accuracy outside of 50ft"

399986,0,"Once I figured out how to get it in position without having to strain my eyeballs to look all the way to the left (move the dang mirror further to the right, silly) I found it to be a good-enough rear view mirror, for the price. The way that it attaches to my sunglasses makes it attach sideways rather than upright like in the product picture, but I can still make it work. Someone should tell the product designer that sporty sunglasses don't usually have skinny little frames. There are little rubber pads on the two outer gripper-arms which slide off and fall in the grass never to be seen again, but they weren't doing much anyways. My prediction for the future of my cheap little rear view mirror involves duct tape.** Update after 1 Year **I left them on my glasses overnight and the forked attachment broke. Yes, duct tape or cable ties might make it work again but I think I'll treat myself to the ""Safe Zone Bicycle Helmet Mirror"" as a replacement, instead."

303484,0,"I got this program expecting it to be amazing based on feedback from other users. What I didn't realize is that it's not something that is doable for most people. First of all, keep in mind that all the workouts take at least 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete as recommended (most are longer). This is incredibly difficult to accomplish 6 days per week for working people. Second, the weight/strength workouts are excellent and do produce results. It's the cardio/plyometrics/yoga workouts that could use some help. They are very repetitive, which, when translated into an hour and a half of workout, becomes boring fast.For me, it was worth the purchase if only for the strength training workouts. I will have to schedule carefully to make sure I have the time to complete entire routines. The others will collect dust."

39229,0,"I purchased the SelectTech Dumbbells but returned them after a couple of weeks for two main reasons. First, they just weren't heavy enough. This is primarily my fault since I knew how much they weighed when I purchased them. 52.5 pounds just isn't enough weight for any kind of halfway serious male workout. Secondly, and more importantly, their build quality appears dangerously low. The mechanism securing the weights (which are allowed the move a great deal) to the dumbbell is plastic, and anything other than very careful handling would likely break it. I was never confident that the weights wouldn't fall off the dumbbell. Further, the mechanism is only warrantied for a year, so apparently Bowflex only had so much faith in the product as well. I subsequently purchased a set of PowerBlocks off Craigslist and am completely satisfied. They're durable, heavy, and backed by a ten year warranty. I would recommend them to anyone. They're also less expensive new."

But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging.

294946,2,"I liked the idea of a front basket and this one looked good. But unfortunately it didn't work well for my situation, and I would think my situation is pretty common. The biggest problem is the handlebar mount. the brackets are bend for a small diamter, whatever that is, I'd say an inch/25.4 mm? Most handlebars these days have a larger diamter where mounted to the stem and then tapper off towards the ends. This does not work with this basket. I have tools, probably above average and managed to rebend the brackets for my off the mill stock handlebar on my average raleigh usa bike by clamping the bracket down with a c-clamp and then using a pair of plumbers pliers and that worked fine since the handlebar was made from steel. If it was alluminum, it might not have been that great for the handlebar. But even though this worked, now the screws wouldn't fit anymore, due to the slightly larger diameter, the handlebar is in the way of the screw. I believe that to be really poor design - if the brackets would have been bend for the today common stem diameter and having punched the mounting holes for that diameter, I would think it would work equally well on the ""vintage"" handlebar diameter by tighting the screws it would just adjust, but this way arround it does not work and this is not mentioned anywhere in the product description. Now I could hardly return the basket so I worked arround this by using cable ties, but I am concerned about the longevity of this solution. Also, since I have a straight mountain bike handlebar the basket is kind of too close to the grips and brake levers and shifters. For my setup the brackets would need to be 1.5 to 2 inches longer, then it would actually be great and I could give this product 4 or more stars.I believe this basket will only work for you if you have the vintage handlebar diameter before they started tapering it and if your handlebar is a riser style bar with lets say at least 2 inches of rise, otherwise the basket gets in the way of the grips and levers which is borderline dangerous. If that is what you have, this might work well for you. This could be a good product if the handlebar mount could be reengineered to be more universal or adjustable and/or if at least these limitations would get mentioned in the product description."

A lot depends on what you plan to tuck under these - for a T-shirt, I suggest ordering your normal jeans size or even a bit smaller unless you are looking for a baggy look.The straps are a bit limited on adjustment possibilities. By default they are on a ""farmer setting"", i.e. with the bib almost to your chin, which makes the whole getup look a bit silly. If you get the right size and adjust the straps, however, these have a nice fit and could almost be mistaken for a vintage fashion look.Unfortunately, these are clearly made for work. The seams are untidy and the colour of the thread (red and bright white) is appropriate for garage only. Yet I am not sure these would last long in hard work, the fabric and seams do not seem that strong.Having said that, these are by far the best fitting overalls I have owned.

65789,0,"I just got a new Buddy Bowl for my 4-month-old Golden Retriever. He likes to play in his water and was spilling water all over my small kitchen floor and rug. I did a search for spill-proof and tip-proof water bowls and came up with the Buddy Bowl.I have to say, the design is really ingenious. Just as advertised, I can turn it completely over and shake it and nothing comes out...NOTHING! I guess my Golden is either too curious or too smart because he took one drink out of it and then proceeded to put his foot in it and splash water out of it somehow. He ended up getting the floor covered with water. Not as bad as a regular bowl but still...and to top it off, he was more persistent than he was with his regular bowl. I think it was creative enough to hold his attention...more than the other toys I have gotten for him.One other thing worth mentioning, if you have a dog with a large muzzle, they may have a hard time drinking from it. The funneled shape is pretty small in diameter. Even though it holds 1/2 gallon, there is not much water in the funnel itself. As I said, the design is really neat and I'm sure it will work great for most dogs. It definitely does what they say in regards to turning it upside down...not a drop comes out! But if a dog likes to use their feet, they can slap right down in the center and splash water out."

278511,0,I bought it for my kids. I thought the value was good since it's a complete set. But I was disappointed to find out that the volleyball was made of some kind of rubber. The shuttlecocks were good and same with the rackets. What really made me buy this is the net.
378648,1,I have had the Airzound Airhorn for a little over a year now. What i can say is the fact that it is very loud(123DB)..it can be filled to 95PSI..but I only recommend 80-85 PSI. It really gets people's attention when you use it while cycling..to warn drivers when backing out of driveways or at intersections. The mount however..is not the best. You have a very small opening to work with..and if your not careful it can break. But once you get it to where you need it..it will not come off. I have tried moving it with all my strength..and I have not been able to budge it since the screw goes into the nut very snug and tight. If you use this alot..then dont expect it to last long. About 30 short blasts and it will run out of air..or 10 long blasts. To get ALOT more use out of it..simply unscrew the black cap..hook it up to a 1 liter bottle and you have enough air to last for a few days of constant use..as long as you dont exceed 90 PSI. I think this will last a long time..and long as you keep it in one spot..and dont go above 95PSI or else it will blow and thats the end of that. Overall great horn. 4 Stars.Airzound update 11-12-09.... Still working good. Have upgraded to a slightly bigger bottle for slightly more air capacity. Expect 50-60 blasts and 40 long blasts with a 16 OZ bottle..as many as 150 blasts with a 1 liter bottle.Plastic mount is still working well..no sign of breakage or cracks yet. Hose is still in good shape. So far horn is working good. I will update in 6 months or so.
477843,1,"This jacket is extremely water repellent, it is hydrophillic or whatever, I ran my faucet on the coat, and it want even feel wet. The jacket is very light and form fitting, the outer layer feels a little rubbery, but it is lined with soft fabric. This jacket has great features, The only major negative thing I have found is that what is considered BLACK for this jacket is really just a dark gray, but not even a real dark grey, but it still looks great, I just wish it was pitch black.The jacket will keep you warm all year in the south if you wear a hoodie, I am very satisfied with this product, and thought the sale price was great. this jacket is a bonafide protector of human body against moderate conditions of snow and rain."

320490,0,"Another reviewer of this product is right. This bag is for a BIG GUY. If you want to carry 2 gallons of water, along with a 17"" screen laptop, this would do the job. But for me, this was not what I was looking for. I'm 5'7"", not petite as a woman. But still, when I carry this, I feel like a 3 year-old kid is hanging down on my back.Another complaint is the design is very simple so that the compartments are not many enough. If you're looking for a day use with many pockets and compartments, you won't be satisfied.However, I must admit that the craftsmanship is superior. Extremely sturdy, well-made, better quality than any other backpacks I've ever owned. If you're a big guy and want to carry a lot at once, go for it."
425730,0,"these things used to have a lot more heat, dispersed over a shorter time span. now they last forever, or at least 10 hours, but only pump out a little heat and not enough in this northern climate.

I have tried doubling up, but there is only so much extra room in my gloves. unless I take my hands out, which sorta defeats the purpose."
84855,1,"This distribution tree is the best I could find after looking all over the web and in local stores. It makes a FIRM connection to the tank, not relying upon the threaded gas tank connector to help hold the tree in place. And the two piece break down is really handy, both for storage and if you don't need all the height. I have used it and it is really stable.To help with tank stability, I recommend getting a 'Tank Stand' or base, a plastic ring that the 20# tank slips firmly into. Got mine at local UHaul for $6.95, cheaper than or same as any prices on web. Camping World has them for a couple bucks more + shipping. But the stability is great!"

Only buy this gun if you are just getting into paintball. But if you look you can find a metal gun that works better for the same amount of money. And unless you like getting shot all the time because your gun is too loud i suggest you get a better one."
39402,1,"This is a BIG CamelBak and can hold a LOT of water. I purchased it for my son, trying to estimate in my head how much water it would hold. His response when it arrived was that it would be great for hiking but a lot more than he needed for marching band practice. It has additional storage which is nice when hiking but if you need something for that bike ride (or marching band practice) get something a little smaller. My recommendation to my son was - don't fill it full. However, you're still carrying around extra ""backpack"" that you don't need."

265770,0,"The variety of Timex Ironman I got was actually discontinued probably for the same reason that this one will soon be as well -- The ""fast strap"" wrist band is a velcro coated strip of nothing held in place by a velcro fastener that will come un-secured when you do something basic like remove your jacket. Mine came off twice while engaged in such activities, then just the other night the thing simply fell off my arm while out hiking ... and I failed to notice it until having returned to my assigned domicile. The thing is GONE and I am here to warn potential buyers about the ""fast strap"" fad, which is probably great for Timex' business because now I have to buy another stinkin' watch.The moral of my story: CHECK TO SEE THE BAND TYPE AND FASTENER, with the emphasis being on looking for the word BUCKLE. It's up to you when you remove your watch, not the watch itself, and I hope whoever found mine will enjoy loosing it themselves. Other than that this Ironman series is great, I loved the split lap function and the back illumination was bright enough to signal overflying aircraft with. But if given the chance to meet the Timex executive who decided the ""fast strap"" feature was a really good idea I would punch him/her right in the nose."
32063,1,"This thermos is one of Stanley's famous vacuum flask thermoses. Vacuum flask technology is the best technology for preventing thermal attrition (keeping your hot drinks hot and your cold drinks cold). I enjoy my coffee very hot and my water ice cold. When I received this I tested it and found that it kept my coffee nice and hot (not lukewarm) for over 2 days! As for cold, it had ice in my ice water in it after almost 3 days (and I live in the south where it's warm).The entire bottle is stainless steel. It is double-walled, with a vacuum between the steel walls. The screw-on stopper seals very nicely and is made of a very strong plastic, it seems very solid. The cup fits well and is solid plastic with chrome on the outside. Stanley also has a reputation for standing behind their products and offer a lifetime guarantee. It's pretty much impossible to beat the quality of a Stanley and a warranty like that. I am a student and also enjoy the outdoors, and my Stanley is a companion with me everywhere. I always have fresh coffee or tea piping hot. I almost never leave home without it because it is so useful!On camping trips you can also fill it with clean super-hot water and you can put oatmeal in the cup or in a bowl and have an instant hot meal. This thermos performs excellent in the winter too. I left mine outside in my car overnight in sub-freezing weather and the next morning I didn't have time to make more coffee and put it in. When I got to school, I figured = what the heck, I'll see if it's warm - to my surprise is was nice and hot and ready to drink!Here are some specifics on the Stanley Thermos that you might find useful:Thermos:Height: 14 inchesDiameter: 4 inchesCircumference: 12-2/5 inchesComposition of interior: Stainless SteelComposition of exterior: Stainless SteelComposition of Top/Stopper: Plastic/PolymerComposition of Cap/Cup: Plastic/PolymerThermal Attrition Resistance: VacuumMaximum Capacity (Volume): 1 Quart (32 fluid ounces or 1/4 Gallon)Country of Origin: Made in China (not USA, sadly).Cleaning Method: Hand Wash Only [Not Dishwasher Safe]Not Microwave Safe - Do Not MicrowaveGuarantee: Lifetime GuaranteeI must say that I am impressed with the quality and innovativeness of the design. It is definitely a must-have for students, in offices and commuting to work, on the job where ruggedness is required, and out on the trail. The only drawback I see is that it is made in China instead of the U.S.A. Personally, I'd happily pay double the price for one that was made in U.S.A. In any case, a good Stanley product is worth the investment. I am very happy with the product."

I wish they would come back.I have tried almost every basketball currently made, and I eventually chose the Wilson Solution. It has a wonderfully soft feel to the ball, the best on the market, which is what sold it for me. The ball's grip is outstanding; for some, maybe a bit too much. Great bounce. Very true. I cannot yet comment on the durability."

The clamp barely fit on the tube, but once I got it on, it held the bike very securely. The clamps are designed for smaller tubed bikes. My wife's bike is a Diamondback Vital. Because the top frame tube bends down over the bottom frame tube, the clamp can not connect. Works great for the one bike."
37276,0,"First off I'd like to start off this review by saying that like a lot of people have mentioned, the material is super thin. If you take a single layer up to the light you can see the specks of light through it. The collar portion seems to be a double layer though, and the vest itself is decently warm AS A LAYER. By itself, wind will cut right through the thin material and leave you cold. The vest does work well as a thin, insulating layer under a soft shell or windbreaker. The double thickness collar is nice because when you zip up the vest all the way it does keep your neck warm. I would have preferred if the entire vest was the same thickness as the collar though.For the Amazon price, it's not terrible. I'd probably pay a little more and get a Polartec fleece material vest though. Definitely not worth the $40 sticker price that was on the label. But if you plan to just use this vest as an internal layer then it's decent for the $25 price tag."
26177,1,"I bought this program for my wife who is Asian and has a flat butt; however, after the first month her butt started to lift up, become more tight and firm.

262396,2,"I bought this case for my combo shotgun and was very disappointed. The extra barrel sleeve seemed like a cheap afterthought. Despite that fact, I probably would've used it had it actually been large enough to accommodate the extra barrel and the shotgun. The length was not a problem, but the case could only be zipped shut with great effort because the case was too narrow. This item would be fine for just the shotgun but is a very poor design for the extra barrel."
196390,0,This item arrived fast and we are loving it. We bought it for camping and have yet to use it. If it holds up like most coleman products we will be satisfied. The only bad thing about it is the metal is flimsier than I would like it to be.

My doctor recommended that I ran on the treadmill, which I despise, to ease my allergies. I decided to try stepping instead.This is a fun and effective way to get your cardio but you must learn the basic moves first if you're new at this. I ordered a DVD guide and four additional risers and could not be happier.The only thing I don't like about this product is that it's a little loud. For some reason I thought the surface was soft/padded. That's not a big deal though because I'm not a big person, but I was hoping to exercise during my baby's nap and that's not going to happen!!I highly recommend this product."

17538,1,"I bought this handle after looking for a solution to my river boating troubles. I have an 80 pound thrust trolling motor, on a 14 foot jon boat. The motors shaft is 42 inches long. Sometimes I need to raise the motor to operate as shallow as possible, to avoid rocks. When the motor is positioned like this, the handle is much too high to operate comfortably from a sitting position. The HelmsMate Tiller Extension w/Ujoint is the perfect solution. It allows me to operate standing or sitting and from any angle. The handle also allows me to troll/steer with one hand while casting with another (while standing or sitting). The unit fits snugly over the existing motor handle, and all functions work well, including throttle control. I am very pleased with the heavy duty construction and the overall quality of this unit."

With that said, I bought these swimming goggles because many friends recommended it. The reviews here also praise it a lot so I knew I couldn't go wrong with it. I use it mostly for swimming leisurely at the pool or beach. It works great. I've used other (cheap) goggles before and they always have problems with leaking water in or fogging up the lenses, causing the goggles to be useless. I've been getting this type of problem with almost all the goggles I use that it's been a habit to expect these problems. However, with the Vanquisher, I did not have any of these problems at all. I totally love these goggles. They work as specified and also have UV-protection. Highly recommend."
297459,0,"I love Tracy and have followed her exercise plan and overall philosophy for quite a while. I have been committed to doing her exercises for 1.5 hrs/ 4-5 days a week. I like the book for the exercise plan, but cannot do the meals. For a mom with two young kids, I am more apt to grab a Think Thin bar or make a smoothie, than cut up vegetables for an egg white omelet in the morning. I commend Tracy for her attempt to have real food in her menu plan, but in reality the rush of the day makes it impossible to create these meals. I think it would also be better if the ingredients were reused throughout the week so that if you buy chicken on Sunday, it can be used for several dishes throughout the week. This would make the prep time shorter and more economical."

110048,2,"I don't normally write reviews but I felt this bike really needed an honest review. So, here's my experience....The price was reasonable and the bike arrived quickly. Although, I didn't know until a week later because UPS and my apartment complex failed to notify me.The packing was good. The bike stayed protected during travel even though the box was clearly beat up.Assembly wasn't too bad. The product manual that comes with the bike is for a vary basic model Kent mountain bike and has none of the components on the GMC. SO, there are no directions for the disc brakes, derailers, shifters, kick stand, seat or suspension. All completely different. Luckily, with a little common sense you can still assemble the bike. The front disc brake needs to be connected once the front wheel is on. No big deal, except that the crimp on the end of the cable came off and left a nice frayed cable. I recrimped it. I also had to bend the kickstand to get it to an angle that would actually support the bike. Assembly done, I went for a ride the next day.P.s. Check the tightness on everything factory assembled. I found this out the hard way.Ride one. About 5 miles on a mildly hilly asphalt/cinder trail. I rode around the parking lot a little to check the basics and found the front derailer doesn't like to shift from 1 to 2. No biggie, that's a little adjustment. Up the first hill, I stood up to get a little extra power but the front suspension was so soft that as I cranked down the fork would dip and twist the wheel almost dumping me. Second hill I stood up again for added power but took it easy as not to buckle the front suspension again. This time though, the cheap plastic peddle split right down the middle.The ride comfort was mediocre. The saddle was not as forgiving as it looks. The rear suspension is a little soft for my 6'1"" 205lb body but is supposedly adjustable to 600+lbs. However, I don't know how to do that because the bike comes with the wrong manual.Ride two. Relatively flat, through the neighborhood. New resin peddles installed. Ride was going fine until again I made the error of standing up to peddle. Again the front suspension couldn't take it and the front wheel twisted and I went down. When I picked the bike back up, I found that the wheel was pointing one way and the handlebars another. Hence the reason for checking all the factory tightened parts.I took the bike home and popped the top off of one of the front shocks to see if there was a place to adjust the tension, as a local bike pro suggested, only to find that 50% of the shock is just an illusion and several inches down inside the rusty tube was a tiny little screw that didn't look like it would do much. So, I grabbed a drink and sat down to right this review. And yes, the inside of the brand new bicycle's suspension is rusty.I'm not gonna give up on it just yet but my happiness with my new bike is rapidly disappearing."

Like others said, definitely use a regular-size soccer ball, not the big ones that come with the set (by the way , the big balls I received were solid red and blue, a nice sheen to the material but no stripes.

424965,0,"I bought one of these speed bags from Big 5 Sporting Goods when it was on sale. I always wanted to exercise with a speed bag, but I didn't want something big or hard to transport. It's fun to use, though the suction cup doesn't work well. When I hit it hard, the bag goes flying. I tried taping the suction cup to the table, but the electrical tape I used wasn't sticky enough. (Try duct tape next time.) The bag isn't as reliable as I expected. Mine already has a rip in it, so it's finished. I didn't even use it that much, but maybe I shouldn't have used it as a club last night when I was in a rage. I'll probably get another one because this is the most portable and yet realistic punching bag I've seen."

160610,0,"In general the watch is very nice. I have two problems. Mr. Watch says the offer 100% satisfaction but if their is somthing wrong with the watch they will not take it back if you have worn the watch. The problem I have is... that often you do not know if the watch works or you are satisfied until one wears the watch. The other issue is that I switched my order from the pro-diver to the grand diver because they advertise on their web-site that the grand diver has a saphire chrystal. I have spoke with Invicta and the grand diver does not have a saphire chrystal so their advertising is incorrect. Despite this mistake Mr. Watch would not take the watch back. My watch also has glue or some kind of strand under the chrystal, and because I have worn the watch they will not take it back. I feel I had two lagitimate reasons for returning/exchanging the watch. The first being that the watch is defective and the second being that the watch is not what they claim it to be. Anyway, I consider myself a reasonable person. Be ware, if you have an issue with your watch they may not be willing to help you out! Read their return policy very closely, as once you take the watch out of it's orgiinal packaging you are stuck with the watch unless you want to send it back to Invicta for a 8 week lead time to recieve your watch again. Mr. Watch claims 100% satisfaction but this claim is not true, so be ware of this!"

44965,2,"I bought one of these because I needed a slightly larger cooler than my trusty Lil' Oscar for a 3-day canoe camping trip. I pre-chilled the cooler by filling it with ice the day before the trip and my food and drinks were cold before I put them inside. Even after taking those steps, in less than a day all the ice had melted. By the morning of the second day, all of the food and drinks were warm. My trip was in the spring. The high temperatures were in the 50's and 60's and I kept the cooler in the shade as much as possible. Even so, it failed to keep things cold and I had to throw some of my food away. I would say that if all you want to do is take this cooler on an afternoon picnic or tailgating then it may be OK, but make sure you plan for having lots of water in the cooler from melting ice. It is definitely not an efficient cooler."

What I didn't get was a hat that could withstand wind. any wind. at all.The brim of the hat has nothing to either weigh it down or stiffen it, so when the wind blows your sun/rain protection disappears- the brim folds back against your head and no longer offers protection. I've resorted to buying a lightweight chain from the hardware store and putting inside the brim all the way around. It adds weight and is annoying to cut a hole in a brand new hat, but I couldn't find any other way to keep it up.."

276493,0,"i bought this gun for my sister and i got a tippmann 98 custom.This is a good gun for the price but the mask,hopper and pods are realy bad.my cuz was using this gun and when i shot him in the hopper and it broke and scrood-up 175 paintballs because the hopper broke and broke the other paintballs. the mask is a pice of junk and you can barely use it is not shaped right. the guns accuricy ain't so great but it might have been the paintballs (monster balls) they split like crazy and curve alot. the squeegy is realy nice and does a great job.

267528,1,"Product arrived fairly quickly, just over the stated delivery estimate, in roughly the stated condition. The blade is almost nearly center, which is decent considering the price of the purchase; however, the grade of steel stated, I feel, is of lesser quality than stated as it had received a few nicks and the tip/point had bent into a small nub after only a few experimental tosses. All in all, a good product for its price but one should be wary of blades at ""affordable"" costs."

148901,1,"Look guys,....the chain is strong BECAUSE of the thicker sideplates and less lateral flex than a derailleur type chain. Isn't that what we want in a single speed/fixed gear chain?I'm running two of the KMC 610HX 3/32"" BMX chains currently, and they work GREAT!One is on my 49cm 1977 Schwinn Paramount run mostly as a single speed, but fixed gear at times. (using a White's Industry Trials 18T Freewheel and 42T Dura Ace chainring, or 16T Dura Ace track cog on another wheel for fixie) The other chain is on my 650c titanium 50cm Serotta ""Concours"", where i'm using a Chris King stainless single speed cog......also 18T. The bike was already light,.....but now near 18 pounds without controls/cables/derailleurs!Anyway,.....instead of ""complaining"" how this chain won't fit properly in the Park Mini Chainbreaker (Model CT-5),.....DO something about it!I'm an ex-jewelry repaiman/diamond setter,....did it for 35 years. I still have my Foredom flexable shaft machine at home,.....which is simply a higher quality Dremel. Using a 1 inch thin stone cut off disc, it took all of 15 seconds to carefully trim a few thousands off the anvel to allow this chain to fit properly in the tool.I actually took a little off the 2 prongs opposite the anvel side also, more to smooth it up as my tool was a little bumpy there.Anyway,......the Park CT-5 tool works perfectly on this chain now,.....and hasn't changed in it's ability to work with the smaller chains just fine!For those of you without a flexshaft machine and wanting yor park tool to fit, a thin flat sided file would work also,.....we're only talking a little off the anvel top. And as the anvel is stepped with 2 small thin ridges and a slightly wider base,.......it's not much to file away. Just have a piece of the chain in hand to check it as you work.......shouldn't take more than a few minutes with a thin flat jewelers style file.No file handy,.....bring a coffee and some donuts to your local jeweler and ask him to shave a little off the tool's anvel to fit the chain you'll have with you.cheers,Joe T (aka ""joejeweler"")"
494743,2,"This computer is a remarkable piece of junk. Everything on it is the cheapest possible grade. The magnet broke in my hands when I tried to install it. I used the magnet from an old Cateye computer. Even the plastic zipties were dried and snapped. The reset button on the computer itself sticks in the ""in"" position. The mounting bracket doesn't hold the computer firm enough so when you press the display button the computer goes flying off the bike. The battery only lasted 3 months. The display turns rainbow colors at about 60 degree F. BUT, you get wattage and all other vital info for your workout--so you NEED this thing. My Kurt kinetic rock-n-roll trainer is bomb proof. I love it. However, this computer is the biggest hunk of junk I've ever used in my life. Everything about it is of the lowest quality--but you need one, so buy it. Kurt Kinetic should tar and feather the guy who thought it would be a good idea to put their name on this thing. It is just shameful."

I'm 5,4"" and the 55cm is definitely the right size.It's a little tricky to get the ball inflated correctly since you have to pull the pump out and stick in the pin in a matter of seconds--or else too much air escapes. Also, the pin itself if very difficult to remove when you want to refill the ball again.Overall satisfied, fun workout and my back pain has definitely improved."
314562,0,"The fire bowl is essentially a steamer basket, minus the holes.

Yep...we need those to help stand off the ground or to provide stability in soft earth.HOWEVER...the legs are permanently fixed to the bottom and are not adjustable. The fixed leg issue it my biggest grip. It's a pain to pack efficiently when you've got four prongs sticking out and catching on everything in site.I drilled them out and used some round-top 1/4"" bolts and nuts in place of the legs. This allows to remove the legs, invert and re-attach them, and eliminate the snag issues from the original legs.If I didn't have to do the extra work, it would be five stars. The legs, all by themselves, dinged it two stars for me.Other than that...LOVE IT!"

184817,2,"All this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres. I can't think of anything else I have ever bought that was as completely useless as this. It is a toy, pretending to be an air pump. The nonfunctional lever on the top (mentioned by other reviewers) indicates that it was designed as a toy. I'm just happy I was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway, not out on a trail. In the past, I have bought a number of Bell products, including motorcycle helmets. I now shudder to think what might have happened if I had put one of them to the test."
485294,2,"So far many of the reviews have been from people who have owned the system for personal use.I do not dispute that the system is well suited for that.However for the past year I have seen them appear more frequently in hotel gyms. The benefit to the hotel of course is that it takes up very little space. The problem however is that it just doesn't hold up well under heavy use. At every hotel where I have found this in use, all of them were damaged and therefore unusable beyond a certain weight level. The problem seems to be that the locking keys bend. I suspect this is a result of someone incorrectly inserting the key and forcing it through, causing it to warp. Once the damage is done, there is no way to correct it short of taking it to the machine shop and bending it back into shape or buying a new set of keys.So if you are someone who is put in the position of choosing something to put in your hotel's gym, for your customer's sake, DO NOT choose this device. Either get traditional free weights (no moving parts therefore nothing to break). Or get something like an Iron Master."

441529,0,"I like the looks, wide toe box, comfort , light weight, and durability of the uppers on these shoes. The uppers take a beating and still look great. I have had three pairs and the soles on the second and third pair are not holding up like the first pair. The price came down too. Maybe Keen is going for high volume and lower quality. I use these for light construction work and casual wear and the soles are wearing faster and separating from the uppers at the glue line on the last two pairs. One reviewer said the old model was stitched and I believe it because I have no separation on the older pair. Listen Up Keen and change your methods or this guy is going shopping for another Brand. I would give these shoes 5 stars if the soles lasted more than six months. I normally get a year or more from other well made shoes."

134002,0,"I purchased this unicycle for my grandson. When it arrived, the first thing I noticed that the box looked like it had been shipped from a battle zone in Bagdad. I originally intended to give the unit still in the box, but it was so damaged that I opened it immediately to check the contents for damage. Fortunately the contents were undamaged. However, the instructions only provided a picture of the unicycle with the wheel, fork, and cranks assembled. The only assembly indicated was to attach the seat and pedals. Actually I found a box full of parts and a bag of nuts and bolts with no instructions. After a careful review of the picture and relying on my experience with assembling similar equipment, I managed to complete the assembly. The use of some parts required some educated guesses. I think Mongoose needs to provide better packaging and adequate assembly instructions. Also, although the tube and tire were installed on the wheel, the tube was only slightly inflated and the valve stem was protruding from the rim at an angle. It was very difficult to straighten the valve stem and inflate the tube properly."
466819,0,"Be warned: This toy is not going to be easy for children, or even many full-grown women, to fully enjoy. The elastic bands are rather hard to pull and maintain a draw against. This is a common complaint among many of the women in my office who have tried it, as well as my wife and children.The toy comes disassembled in a box. Assembly is awkward and requires a certain amount of brawn to overcome the poor fitting of the molded plastic pieces. Yes, this is pretty much all cheap plastic and I don't expect it to last long at all.Once it is assembled, if you can manage to get a good draw on the thing, it's lots of fun. The vortex that it creates travels slowly but over fairly impressive distances. Just mind that there is nothing between you and your target that would disrupt the vortex. This toy shoots rings of air at low velocities but with amazing accuracy. If you fill the barrel of the toy with fog before firing it, you can see the shape and speed of the vortex as it travels across the room.It doesn't work so well outdoors, especially in windy conditions. But it works brilliantly indoors, especially in open indoor spaces like most office environments. The only warning of impending assault is a VERY loud ""thump"" when you release the drawstring. Then, seemingly seconds later, BOOM. Paper cups are getting knocked over, magazines flipped open, hair jumping up like someone in a Casper cartoon that just saw a ghost. Yes, this toy does inspire a fair bit of hooliganism among coworkers and family members alike.I set up some paper cups from a distance of 15-20 feet away and was able to pick them off individually pretty well with this toy. The cups leap into the air before getting tossed aside. The accuracy of the toy is actually pretty good if you can maintain a steady draw while putting the sights to good use."

280189,2,I used this rope for over two weeks hoping that the fact that it keeps twisting up on itself was just because it was new and needed to be broken in. After two weeks I gave up.

319128,0,"Purchased through my local bike store, standard or small too tight for MTB or road bike with aluminum frames. Also note that these are tapered, smaller towards derailer larger toward sprocket.The lizard skin is very thin as well if you have a tight area. The Velo neoprene is thicker and the standard size does fit both MTB and road bikes with aluminum frames nicely. I think the Velo is better for MTB as the thickness helps provide better protection from the hard hitting chain slaps from jumps and rough trails. The lizard is ok for road bikes that have a smoother ride. Both are a good investment to protect the paint on your expensive toys! :) Not sure how to clean them or just toss them when full of oil? I would measure to be sure of fit, seems for mine the medium would have been a perfect fit in this brand, as each brand does fit differently in their sizes.

206334,0,"It's a nice to have but didn't fit my bike as the instructions suggested. To use this product I had to install it backwards from the directions since my seat post was thicker and had a shock absorber in the post. I have a Giant Sedona, medium size frame. Seems to work ok either way."
465748,0,I paid extra to purchase an InstaStart Stove but apparently I received a conventional Coleman 2-Burner stove since the ignitor feature does not work. I must use a hand held ignitor to start the propane burners. What did I get for the additional purchase price??
332254,0,"I am no expert but it is a decent model, assembly may be a little difficult. The box that comes with the product is very weak, I received mine and it was dented. Pieces are O.K., detail is good. Do not use super glue to put it together, it will leave white marks on the pieces and terrible stains on the ""glass""."
222013,1,"We used this product to patch a Aerobed that we paid $120 for and it holds perfectly! It took about 10 minutes, hardest part was finding the hole. Needed to wait 24 hours to dry but it easy to use with simple instructions."
275755,0,"I bought this to use at the beach and at the gym. I am a small person and the band is so tight it felt like I had a girdle on my wrist. It did securely hold my ID, credit card and key so I guess that's worth something. Very uncomfortable. I would not buy another one or recommend this to another person."
219958,0,"The bowls themselves seem fine. However, one that I bought has a flaw in the rim; some odd buildup of paint or metal. I removed that but now there's a rough spot on the rim. The other bowl I bought at the same time looked fine. I guess it's a bit of luck of the draw."

387914,0,"I have been wearing Gold Toe Windsor wool socks with many happy feet for as long as I can remember. That being said when I needed some ankle length athletic socks I jumped on these. They are just not what I was expecting.

352875,0,Rated it a 3 star because it really didn't work as well as I expectedHad to feed the balls occasionally into the machine for it to work
505434,0,I wanted a reel with longevity. Only time will tell if this reel holds up. It appears well made but does have some line twist and isn't as smooth as some other reels. I read it is because of the way the gears work in this reel. I wouldn't say it's worth the extra cash for this reel but then again I bought it based on it lasting and only time will tell.

Otherwise, its pretty flimsy and the latches are junk. Not something you'd want to use in the field or often, but just for storage it works. My gun fits inside with the scope on it."

203741,0,"I admit I am not a knife aficionado. Ths SOG Flash II was the first knife I bought in years. I bought if from Amazon, so I didn't have a chance to handle it (big mistake). I liked what I saw in the pictures and the reviews were all very positive. When I took it out of the package, I had difficulty opening the blade. Don't laugh, the safety switch is very small, and I feel, in a awkward location. I can't remove this knife from pocket and quickly open it with one hand, I need two hands (maybe I'm a spaz). I have to hold it with one hand, flip the tiny safety switch with my other hand and then open it. I actually like everything else about the knife. It has a good feel, it's not too heavy, and it is razor sharp, but I don't bother carrying it. It's just too cumbersome. It has a place of honor on my dresser collecting dust. I suggest trying this knife in person before buying it."

330033,2,"First of all, this is not the suppliers fault. It was my mistake. For Moms that are trying to order these practice pants, your son will probably not wear them. You would have to wear white compression shorts underneath. If they don't, their boxers will be a peek-a-boo moment. I was unaware you can see through these pants. I will try ordering the heavyweight ones. Thank you though, for offering the variety you do."

38099,0,I had a vest like this one from about 5 years ago but it wore out and I wanted to get a replacement. I got it and it is as warm as the last one but the material seems a bit thin. Not sure how long it is going to last but 5 years would really surprise me.
354526,1,"I recently ordered a pair these for my Tai Chi class. Took exactly 7 days to arrive (processing and shipping time combined). First off, I'd have to agree with the other 3 reviews before me and say that for the price these are good shoes. They do come unlaced, but the laces are included. I got them in black and to quote another reviewer ""The picture is accurate.""I wear a Mens size '10 1/2' which converts to 44 international on their sizing chart. I must say without socks these feel great. However, I have yet to try them with socks. I have only worn them for roughly 15 minutes, so I'm not sure as to how long they generally will last when used for daily Tai Chi (Yang style, if it makes any difference). Although, they feel very durable.Overall, a great item! Perhaps I'll order another pair. =)"

414808,0,"This is a OK Dvd especially if your a Bucss fan like me but as I am watching this Dvd I got the sense that it could have been more than just Ok. The documentary that highlights every game from the season is ok and so are the rest of the features but why not some interviews with the players after the Superbowl some day or why the Buccs homecoming and the parade ?You got a lot of space on a Dvd and it has not been taken advantage of. Especially player interviews could shed some light on how it is to win a Superbowl and how the players react after that win. The parade would really round off the season and you could see the fans going nuts after finally winning a championship. To bad NFL Films, try harder next time."
231348,0,"The hiker pro replacement catridges work since I've used them for years and no one has gotten sick. They do not last nearly as long as advertised though.

I canoe a lot, and I always fill up a collapsable camp bucket out in the deeper, clear water. Then I pour the water through a coffee filter and into my base camp reservoir. If you are using the portable hiker pro, you can bring a couple of 2-liter bottles. Fill one bottle and pour it through a coffee filter into the other one. Then pump out of the coffee filtered bottle. Coffee filters gave me another 10-15 gallons of life out of the filter, and their cheap!"

346391,1,"These sunglasses are perfect for most everything and provide good eye protection from the sun. Perfectly clear, and the lower gradient coating allows driving to be safer and much easier and quicker to read the dials, buttons, controls, yet when looking back up to the road the darker tint is there preventing glare even when driving directly into bright sun. I would recommend these glasses to anyone who drives, walks dogs, shops, rides bicycles, jogs, enjoys the beach, just about any possible use where eye protection from the sun is desired, but with glasses that you can see through very clearly. The fit is perfect, almost no adjustment was required, and very comfortable to wear. The glasses stay put on the nose and ears, do not move about or slide down, they are well constructed, yet light weight. I am going to purchase a second pair, and maybe even a third, I like them that much! These glasses are worth what you have to pay for them."

286805,0,"I gave this product 3 stars for one reason: the color is NOT what I ordered. I ordered PURPLE; I received what looks like an odd navy blue. The whole purpose for ordering purple was to match a team uniform. Although the UA tag had a purple strip to indicate the shirt was purple, it was not. I'm guessing it was a factory second because of the color. I will choose another vendor -- UA directly -- to ensure I receive the color I expect."

19890,1,"I've owned this for a few months (including a recent backpacking trip) and have found it very useful.Pros: Great look, good design/functionality, I like the buttons on the side for each of the measurements. The altimeter seems precise (but drifts from day-to-day due to barometric pressure). The thermometer seems accurate as long as you're not wearing the watch! Not sure if there's any way around that. The compass is great and also seems very accurate. So far it's survived some abrasion and water and handled it fine.Cons: The watch is quite big, I wish there were some way to have a more accurate temperature reading while wearing it, and a more accurate altitude. The watch has to be calibrated daily in order to be accurate. As far as I know, this is true with most any altitude watch as they are based on barometric pressure.Overall I'm very satisfied so far!"

499902,1,Very happy with the purchase of the Hayward S180T Pro Series 18-inch Sand Filter. It arrived in a timely manner and included everything it was supposed to have. We purchased the sand recommended for that filter at our local pool supply company. We are using a 2 HP motor and it works great. Such an improvement over the small filter that came with our pool.

160902,0,"I do understand the concept of ""You get what you pay for"" and this is a prime example. I wanted a cheap automatic watch to see if it was something that I wanted before I spend several hundreds of dollars on one. Yes, the watch does look like a Rolex but it is poor designed and feels really cheap; I feel that if I wore this watch every day for a year it would fall apart. If you don't care about how the watch feels or quality then get this but I don't recommend it but for the price you can't beat it."
372156,1,"This is a really neat product. Thought I would try one to 'see', will order more to have on hand. Durable, compact, can be worn so many different ways. An education in itself learning the different ways to wear it!"

I put my thermos, a few boxes of ammo, flashlight, knife, snack, gloves, hat, heat packs, and sunglasses. That pretty much fills it up, but I don't have to cram it in. It's so much better than tanking a soft bag into the field. I'll probably get another one."

19195,2,"Length:: 0:32 MinsI think this trap is too small for squirrels, at least the ones around my house anyway. The squirrels aren't completely in the trap when they trigger it, so they can escape. The traps are double-ended, so if they enter the other side the same thing happens. It would be better if the trap was a lot longer so there was no chance of the door hitting the animal on the way down. There is no problem with the trigger mechanism, although it is hard to understand it the first time. It will trigger and close fine. The trap st just is too small for a big squirrel.I have had no luck at all with this trap for squirrels because of the size problem. Maybe it could catch a mouse but I don't have a mouse problem.Sorry for the camera shake in the video, I had a very long lens bu no tripod at the time the video was taken."

486209,0,"I received this item yesterday, and assembling it was no problem for me. I have no experience with bikes and I figured it out pretty easily. You just need to make sure you have some allen wrenches on hand.I did run into one pretty big problem. I broke the valve on the inner tube, which was totally my fault, not the bikes. I went to a local bike shop to get a replacement and it's a really weird size. Not standard AT ALL. The guy had actually never seen a bike that needed that size. I went home and called around to other places to try to find it and luckily a bike shop had found a place to order them because people had been coming in with this same bike! He knew exactly which bike I had before I mentioned it, just because of the weird replacement tube.So, a flat tire when riding is inevitable and you'll need replacement tubes, but the ones you need have an extra long valve stem.The size you will need is 700x28c tube, 48mm shrader valve stem.I would recommend you call and see if your local bike shops have this size, because if not, then you will find it hard to fix a flat.Hope this helps!!"
418032,1,"My goal was to find a pack that could be used to haul enough gear to spend six days up at a 12,000' base camp at the Sierra's Palisades Glacier, and then stripped down for technical rock and ice climbs.It's a little small for a week long trip carrying both rock and ice climbing gear, but managable with a few items like helmet, rope, and crampons attached to the outside. It sure beats using a larger pack on approach, while also carrying a smaller summit pack along for the technical climbing.The frame sheet and stays provide enough support to haul about a 50 pound load ten rugged miles into basecamp. This suspension can then be removed, reducing the pack's weight down to a little over two pounds for the serious climbing. Last month it performed beautifully in stripped down condition on a steep approach and up a five pitch ice climb. The compression straps reduced the pack to an ideal shape for my light load on this day climb. In addition, the pack is flexible enough for serious climbing once the suspension is removed. The large padded hipbelt can be removed, and replaced with a webbing belt (provided.) Both belts have gear loops for racking your climbing pro.While not as comfortable as a backpacking style of pack like a Bora, this pack seems to be in a class of its own as far as being a good size pack that can serve as both an approach pack with a solid suspension that can be converted into a lightweight technical climbing pack.It could be improved by adding an internal sleeve for a hydration bladder. In addition, you have to be careful how you pack it to achieve good support and comfort with heavier loads."

451769,2,"Unlocked safe with key, installed batteries, pressed the inside red button and entered a code. All went fine so I reentered code followed by the star key and was able to turn and unlock the door. Great! .. except for the humming sound I heard from the door. Over the next 10 test attempts it unlocked only twice and then the humming stopped. At this point I made a number of other attempts which all failed. I changed out the batteries with new fresh batteries, reset the code and still it wouldn't unlock. Inserted & turned the key and when turning the dial it was very stiff with quite a bit of resistance. I'm guessing there is an issue with the internal Solenoid.Returned and looking for something that's more reliable.I also purchased the smaller Stack-On PDS-500 Drawer Safe which is working just fine.. for now. Items stored in this do not require quick access so I'll likely keep it and hopefully it continues to work fine. If not I have the keys. We'll see how it goes."
272002,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."
457198,1,They are good targets. As I need more I plan to order them. The right size for good precise shooting.
139469,1,"I bought the blue ""light tension"" grip, and it works as you would expect. You squeeze it and it exercises your hand. Very nice for those quiet moments when you feel like you should be doing something productive, so might as well strengthen your grip. I feel like it helps me relieve stress too.However, one thing to keep in mind is that the tension setting is the same for each finger. So while my fore, middle and ring fingers completely dominate this exerciser with ease, the weak, pathetic pinky can't even push it down all the way. (Get with it pinky!)I get the feeling that since the tension is too much for the pinky to handle that it doesn't really get exercised. While the point of equal tension may be to have all fingers roughly the same strength, the pinky will probably get far weaker than the rest of my fingers since I can't really do any reps with it. It's like trying to bench 250 lbs when you can only bench 200. You would get a much better work out with a manageable tension where you could actually do the full range of motion.I just wish there was a system where you could adjust the tension for each of your fingers dependent on how strong they were."
54812,0,"Ok, in fairness, I knew going in that this wasn't a tough, military grade quality item. It's actually the 2nd one I've purchased. I bought this more as a gimmick than an actual planned piece of kit. The lazer adjustment screwes are a pain in the @$$ to adjust and the on/off swith is about as basic as it gets, but it works. Has good range and is fairly small for the price. Like most electronic devices, smaller means more expensive. But not here. So long as you don't rely solely on this as a primary aiming device, you can't really go wrong. The size really frees us a variety of mounting options for a rifle. The mounting cleats are fine so long as you don't torque them to oblivion. If you are really concerned about them coming loose, I recommend Lock-Tite. I used that on a BSA Reflex and it saved the threads. Are there better options avaliable? Yes. At this price? No. Take it for what it is and have some fun"
509443,0,"I have used the RCBS Rock Chucker single stage reloading press and it is a solid, quality piece of equipment. I thought that the RCBS product name would almost insure that any other RCBS product would be a top notch piece of equipment. That is not the case with the RCBS turret press. I found it to be crudely manufactured and just not up to the quality that I expected to find with RCBS. I should say that the turret press is a good piece of reloading equipment but if I were to do it again I would probably buy a Redding turret reloading press and save me the headache of dealing with something sub standard."
460714,0,"As others have said, this ball is pretty good, but the pump is absolutely terrible. On my third pump the top half of it came off. Luckily I still have a foot pump from a previous ball. Once this was filled it seemed ok. The ball is a little lopsided and it has a slow air leak so I have to pump it up every week or two, but otherwise it seems very sturdy and less likely to pop that my last one. Minus one star for the horrible pump that is a waste of space, and minus another for the minor air leak and lopsidedness. Other than that, it's a pretty good ball and works great as a replacement to my office chair."

200504,1,"I've recently moved my very herd bound horse to another farm and from field to stall board so I bought this to try and ease her pain :) It was a devil to get out of it's shrink wrap packaging, and to get the flavor part out of it's plastic. I bought a ring clip and hung it from her stall window with a piece of baling twine. She ignores it. It smells lovely and I'm not above admitting I took a lick myself before I hung it (don't judge me, it smelled really good) - tasted a lot like a sour apple sweet tart. When she ignored this one, I used the same holder and tried the peppermint refill as she is a peppermint fiend. She still wanted nothing to do with it. Chewing the wall of the stall is apparently much more fun. Maybe they will come out with a wood flavor. I've seen other horses go crazy over these and as I can vouch for it smelling (and tasting) yummy, I can only conclude this is yet another example of my horse's hatefulness and that this is a fine product. I would like them to change the wrapping around the flavor block though so I didn't need 15 minutes, a knife, and a strong reserve to ignore my horse's laughter while trying to get the darn thing out."

467392,0,"E-Force racquets are known for their power. The patented 22"" long-string frame generates ball speeds four to eight miles per hour faster than the competition's designs. Alas, the stock strings and factory tension are just a tad to thick and tight to generate maximum power. Even so, this tear-drop shape racquet generates ample power for solid drive serves and passing shots. This racquet gets a B-grade for power.At 185-grams unstrung this carbon-fiber racquet is an medium weight racquet, about 1-ounce heavier than the lightest racquets on the market. The balance point is slightly toward the head. The overall balance allows quick response in the front court. The racquet head gets through the hitting zone quickly with a flick of the wrist. This racquet gets an A-grade for balance.The tear-drop head shape offers medium control and slightly below average feel. The stock grip size is super-small (3 5/8"") allowing good wrist action and racquet whip. The flair to the handle butt anchors the racquet well in the palm of the hand. Overall, the wrap grip feels good in the hand. Vibration is noticeable on off center hits, presumably correctable with vibration damper. This racquet gets a C-grade for control and feel.Overall, this racquet offers solid value and gets a B-grade."
397871,0,"I was looking for a bike helmet that was better made and differently styled than the standard bike helmets out there. This is a nice, multi-sport helmet that is heavier than a standard bike helmet so not the helmet to buy if weight is an issue. It's also a little hotter inside this helmet than a standard bike helmet but that is to be expected from this type of helmet. Appears to be made from higher quality materials as well. I agree with the one negative review, huge disappointment in the color. I couldn't see most of the reviews very well since I ordered this on my mobile. I bought the Matte Olive and the color is definitely more of a charcoal color and you might see the faint iridescent green in bright light and you strain to see it. Nothing at all close to the photo. Also, no size chart? I have 21"" head circumference and bought the medium which gives a comfortable, not-too-snug fit."
247534,0,"This diving mask really is as good of a compromise between goggles and a scuba mask as one can hope for. You look sort of like a caped avenger when wearing it, which is either extremely awesome, or very nerdy, depending on who you are. I like that the eye-widows are glass, rather than plastic. Feels as though the glass would be difficult to scratch or mar, a plus if you plan on using these at the beach. I like the extra-wide strap, and it hugs your head nicely.However, the strap feels sort of cheap, and although it has not broken, I'm not sure how much life it will have. The material used for the rubber (maybe something like silicon?) does not seal well to an unshaven, or even partially scruffy face--but I assume this is more a problem with facial hair than with the mask. I like my diving masks to fit a bit more tightly, however, when you tighten the straps, the locking mechanisms on the side of the eye-pieces do not hold very fast. After a few dives, they loosen to the point of the mask letting in a bit of water.This mask is ideal for back-yard, low intensity pool use. If you plan on doing anything rigorous while underwater, I don't know, flips or something, this mask is likely to come off. Definitely do not take it body surfing, as a turbulent wave-crest will be all that's necessary to tear this thing off your face and into the ocean.While this mask is sufficient for most of what I use it for, I think I would buy a more robust mask in the future."

230839,1,"I bought a few of these shirts for a 3 week trip to South America. These shirts are really great! They are made of a waffled ""dri-fit""-type of material. They breathe incredibly well and don't stick to you even when sweaty. The material itself is good, but is more snag-prone than other materials imo. Also, since it breaths so well, it does not offer much sun or insect protection. Nevertheless, this shirt is perfect for hot weather trips.As a word of warning, in terms of sizing, these shirts run a bit smaller than the sizing chart would indicate. I have a 40"" chest and should technically wear a medium, according to the chart. Medium fits like a muscle tee. If you are borderline between sizes, you might want to consider going up a size."

163572,1,Someone tried to steel my bike last night but lucky for me this bad boy held up just fine.It looks liked they tried to go at it with bolt cutters I'm not too sure. What I do know is that that even though they put my lock through abuse it did not budge at all.The small size made it extra hard on these bike robbers to get any leverage. and the way this thing is built the only way to get it off is with a key or with something powerful enough to saw through it (that is easier said than done). The most that these bike robbers were able to accomplish was just ripping through a small hole in the plastic cover the metal.The metal part of the lock is all completely in tact.The lock is still functional just a little beat up. I know I could probably still use it to lock up my bike but I'm going to get a new lock just for good measure.From now on if I'm going to buy any bike lock it's going to be Kyrptonite. Sure its a little pricey but I'd rather have to buy a new lock than have to buy a new bike.Kryptonite Evolution Mini Bike U-Lock

209421,1,"The case locks are, indeed, TSA approved, the case seems pretty indestructible, as do the locks but . . . My son has a Nike Xtreme element bag, which has a rigid, handle at the top. This makes the bag not only 14 inches at the base but 14 inches at the bottom. While this product is sold as a 4814--i.e., 48 inches long and 14 inches wide, it is definitely NOT 14 inches its entire length. I cannot close the case entirely without forcing it closed, which means putting enough pressure on the bag's semi-flexible aluminum tube (which runs up its side and gives it rigidity) that I was able to close the case. Now, I have to hope that forcing the bag like this won't damage the bag in the long run during flights, because I didn't have sufficient time to send it back before we needed the case. Ugh.

221256,0,"I bought this bed for my 2 year old to take with us when traveling. We have not actually traveled yet, but once we got it we inflated it to see how he reacted to it. First of all if using the manual foot pump, I cannot imagine how long it would take to inflate all of the pieces! We have an electric pump and it still took a good 15 minutes. When we put it in front of our son his face lit up at the site of Elmo. He immediately got on to the bed and then, while very cute, he started jumping on it proclaiming ""Bounce, Bounce, Bounce"". We let him have his fun for a few minutes then explained it was for sleeping. He immediately laid down (after retrieving his faithful bear) and pretended to snore! He didn't bounce on it again, but we have yet to have him sleep on it for a whole night!Overall I think it is a great bed for traveling. The only two cons that I have is the time it takes to inflate and also the time it takes to deflate! We stuck drinking straws in the valves to keep them open (to allow the air to escape) and after 7 DAYS it was still not completely deflated! This may be a problem if you need to deflate it and pack it up to travel!"

408218,0,"Bottom line is, if someone asked me if I would 'recommend', I would pause and struggle. Well...I wouldn't NOT recommend..afterall, I do sweat in a hurry; it does get your heart going; it doesn't take up much space; it is built well; it does give you a few variations of usage. Unfortunately, I can't comment on what results I get because I don't USE IT enough to really know. By the same token, I cannot comment on anything mechanical either, for the same reason.We all have our own reasons for NOT using something and certainly most can relate to having fitness equipment that collects dust, or clothes! So when friends or family members ask me why I don't use mine, other than all the personal excuses, the reasons are this:I find that I have to be so careful how I walk and how I place each and every step I make on this machine, or it occasionally twists my knee around. I cannot explain it in writing, but it's so frequent that it does this that I spend all my time concentrating on walking so that I'm unaffected! If I don't, I have had it jerk my knee, my ankles and it of course affects everything on up - back, hips, etc.It doesn't seem to make any difference whether I use the treadles, or lock them together to use as treadmill. In fact, when I use the treadles, I find that i have to walk with somewhat of a straddle to give equal weight proportion to the motion otherwise your motion is something equivalent to walking with one high heel shoe on and one off. So, the very way that you step manipulates the treadles.All this completely takes away from enjoying the use of the machine and it becomes a chore for me. I have other things I want to concentrate on than each and every step I make, and being so cautious! I mean, who wants that?!Funny, I have read every review and every comment and don't see anyone else mentioning these things and I'm not sure why not. My sister and a friend jumped on my machine and they could completely see what I was talking about. Is it just my machine? I don't know. I purchased mine directly from Bowflex and paid a bundle more than this price showing on Amazon, btw!Again, it isn't that I DON'T recommend this item, but for me, anyway, I would probably get more enjoyment, more usage, and therefore greater results, for FAR LESS money using something else."

391441,1,"This thing does exactly what you want it to reliably, easily, and accurately. At first, I was hesitant to purchase this because I thought I wanted the ability to log data. But with as often as I glance at it, I have a pretty good idea about where I'm at relative to my workouts and runs.Overview:The monitor is small, lightweight, and comfortable. The rubber that the strap is made of is surprisingly soft. It doesn't slide around when sweating, either. The chest strap is accommodating as well. I have a 44"" chest and there is still plenty of room left in the strap. Conversely, it looks like there is plenty of room to bring the strap in if you were female.Pro's:-The display is ""massive"" for such a small watch. It's easy to see with a quick glance.-The button on the front allows you to turn the monitor on and off, conserving battery life.-Comfortable-Has an indiglo button in case you run at night.-Can recall average and peak heart-rates; an excellent feature for those in training.-Has alarms for heart rate ranges, and will also allow you to recall the amount of time you spent in your range.-Waterproof, unless you are a diver and have a weird obsession with checking heart rate at depths beyond 30mCon's:-There aren't any really. You could say that data-logging is not available, or other minor details (not made of carbon fiber? I don't know), but you can easily remedy this by upgrading to a different model.For the price, this heart rate monitor is top-notch. It looks ""athletic-y"" (that's a word -- don't argue), it's easy to see day or night, can recall average heart rates, and is cheap and reliable. I spent a lot of time researching (and even trying) monitors. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."

27974,0,"About two years ago, I found this watch (721XLTMRW is stamped on the back, so it's the same) elsewhere for $59.95 and free shipping. It was supposedly a discontinued model which accounted for the low price. It's attractive and, thanks to the titanium case, very light weight.The band is a single-piece, fairly stiff black rubber band that wraps entirely around the case and is decorated with two red stripes. When new, there was a sturdy metal clasp right next to the buckle. This made it practically impossible to buckle and unbuckle the band, so I pried it off as a previous reviewer did. This solved the problem, but left two 1/16 inch holes in the band where the clasp had been attached.The watch keeps good time, and has a white face that is easy to read. The 3 chronograph dials look cool, though I find it too hard to use them. I simply let the stopwatch run all the time, which provides a nice sweep second hand.I needed the battery replaced once, which a local jeweler did for $10. As far as I can tell, it's very waterproof - I wear it in the shower and swimming, and have newer had a problem. It has a screw-down stem, which helps keep water out. If you find it for under $75, go for it, otherwise look elsewhere."

148338,1,"This knife is very well built, and is clearly intended to withstand heavy use. In spite of its heft, it is very comfortable in the hand, and it is not cumbersome to carry around. Folded, it takes surprisingly little space. All in all, a wonderful knife for everyday use or ordinary outdoor activities."
482638,0,"The knife I'm reviewing is actually the ""limited edition"" Random Leek. It's the same as the regular Leek except it has the Kershaw ""tanto"" point blade. The blade is called a tanto but it's not. It's more of a squared-off drop point or a reverse tanto. Hard to describe, but if you know what a tanto point looks like just think of it upside down and that's the tanto point on this knife. That's the only difference in the standard Leek and the Random Leek so it's not a major point to consider.My first impression of this knife is that it looks neat. The first thing I did was to disengage the blade lock. That was my first clue that looks can be deceiving. The blade lock is a tiny little button that is not at all smooth in moving from closed to open. Even after applying some Tuff-Glide to the button, it still is rough. On closer observation, the lock is nothing more than a tiny little nub that slides over the tip of the blade to prevent the blade from opening inadvertently. And this little nubby protrusion looks like--yikes!...plastic!. Maybe not. I can't tell. But surely not. This is supposed to be a safety feature and I don't think a tiny piece of plastic is anything to depend on to keep the blade from opening in your pocket.Next, the assisted opening feature. It's no big deal. It's really not. I have several knives that can be opened faster and more smoothly than the feature on this knife--knives that don't have assisted opening moreso than a thumb stud or hole on the blade. The Benchmade Griptillian can be opened more quickly by simply disengaging the Axis Lock and flipping the blade. The Al Mar SERE 2000 is significantly smoother and faster with only a thumb stud. And, lest you think I'm only comparing those knives that cost two to four times the price of the Leek, I have a CRKT flipper knife that is butter smooth and quick opening. The blade material on the CRKT is garbage and it won't take an edge for diddly but the knife mechanism is significantly better than the Leek's.To point out another little problem, the thumb stud on the Leek is positioned too close to the pivot. My hands are large and I can't get much leverage on the stud to open the knife. The protruding flipper on the spine is the only way I can get the assisted opening to work for me, even after applying a good bit of Tuff-Glide to the pivot and working it in. Basically, unless I want to impress someone (unlikely) or I only have one hand free, I'll probably use the knife a lot as a two-handed opening like a slip-joint and ignore the assisted opening feature.It has a frame locking mechanism. Frame lock/liner lock mechanisms are generally not as secure as other methods such as a back lock or the Benchmade Axis Lock (I love that lock!). The Leek's lock appears to be pretty secure but looking at the point where the frame lock spring engages the blade, it's a bit disconcerting to see how little contact there is. I've whacked the back of the Leek's blade a few times to check how securely it locks and it hasn't failed. That's good--I have had several liner lock knives that closed when this was done. If you squeeze the frame at the section that locks, you can move that section into full contact with the blade. That is about as secure as you can make it. But it then requires you to pry the locking section out so you can unlock the blade. That turns a supposedly one-handed knife into a knife that needs two hands and an extra tool to close. The lock seems secure enough for light duty use so I wouldn't sweat it.This knife is sharp! The tip of the tanto blade is needle sharp and I've punched myself with it a couple of times already. Ouch. The edge cut through paper cleanly right out of the box. I'm pretty good at sharpening knives but I don't know that I can get this good of an edge on a knife. Scarey sharp.For those like myself who have large hands, the handle may be a challenge. It's smooth metal on one side with a clip on the other. It's pretty small and it can be slippery if wet. Be careful. I wish it had some cut-outs on the smooth side but that would detract from the design elements.This is a very good knife even though I've pointed out some areas I consider to be deficient. Nothing is perfect and the Leek is no exception. What I like about it is that it is flat and slim and it carries well loose or clipped in the pocket. The blade length is 3"" and that's about right for any task I need a knife for. The blade is thin, however, and that means it will not stand up to much abuse. It's not a heavy duty knife but it was never meant to be. The assisted opening feature is not a good reason to buy this knife, in my opinion. It's just nothing special in that regard. But the Leek is a fine choice for daily carry and use when you aren't going to be cutting through heavy materials or using your knife as a pry bar or screwdriver. It's okay...I like it okay. I go with 3 stars overall."
397835,0,Agree with previous poster. Purchased these in hopes of having better luck but knowing either way it was still a pretty good deal. Don't think they should be advertised as HX Hot Bite when almost half (16 out of 36) were HX bite. Believe this is deceptive.

I have seen this kickstand in other road bikes so I was able to install this in my road bike with no problem. Perhaps the manufacturer should know about this. It would not cost much to include a 1 or 2 page installation instruction. I would have rated this a 4 even a 5 if it had installation instruction.
99442,0,"i build my bikes, and i'm picky. i bought the gmc denali road bike (large) to use on a trainer, but it will see occasional use on the road as a 'guest' bike. i have plenty of spare parts on hand and so far have replaced the wheelset, tires, brakes, crank, chainring and cassette (53/11), derailleur, saddle, seatpost, pedals (spd) etc with quality parts. next up are bb, stem, dropbar & conversion to 9 speed sti. i already had replacement components and it cost me very little to do this. some of this is complicated, requires special tools, and not for a novice. but its a great way to learn, albeit, the hard way. no matter what you do, the denali will never be a true road bike, because the frame and fork are hybrid by design.for me, its fun rebuilding this brand new bike, but i would not recommend a novice to buy it. if you dont know how to set a bike up, you'll need to take it to a bike shop where they may tell you it's a piece of junk. and as it comes, it is, but you get what you pay for. for $250, theres a schwinn that looks much better. better yet, spend $500 for a entry level sti bike that will still require set-up. any bike purchased in a box, regardless of cost, requires set-up by a competent mechanic.the denali comes geared like a mountain bike or hybrid, not a road bike. the frame geometry is odd for a road bike, more like a hybrid with a short top tube for a more upright position. 27.5 lbs out of the box, the large frame standover height is 34"" with 700x23 tires that i installed. probably 34.5"" with the originals. the denali has a 135mm spread (hybrid spacing) at the rear dropout but comes with a 130mm freewheel hub. as it comes, the rear triangle is squeezed together - this is a no-no with aluminum. so if you want to change the gearing (upgrade to a cassette), you'll have to replace the rear wheel, ideally with a hybrid wheelset as dictated by the dropout spacing. it has a 1"" threaded headset which is an old set-up and requires harder to find quill stems, or a conversion adaptor to 1-1/8"" unthreaded. the fork is steel and heavy. the supplied brakes flex badly and the brake mounts have to be drilled out to accept modern brakes (long reach) with recessed bolts. the tires/wheels are junk. the stem, handlebar/shifter assembly is bizarre. the cables & housings need to be redone. the manufacturer really struggled to use the cheapest parts/manufacturing possible. in spite of this, it's amazing to me that it could be delivered to my door for less than $200.i initially tuned the bike as is, and everything worked, but i wouldn't use it that way on the road, or on a trainer. when the transformation is complete, it will be a decent sora/tiagra level bike. but the only original parts will be the frame & fork. as i said, i already had most parts, so little cost to me. if i had to buy the parts, it wouldn't make sense to buy this bike.as of right now, after replacing the drivetrain, the denali is perfect for use on my trainer, and cost effective in my case. but i would strongly advise newbies to spend more for a decent bike. this one has too many issues. better than nothing though, if its all you can afford. or just want to give biking a shot on the cheap, understanding it's a throwaway bike, not really suitable for upgrading. not a road bike, its a poorly built hybrid with a very strange dropbar and a odd hybrid fork that will be difficult or impossible to upgrade or replace. but it will work as is, if properly set-up. the cables/housings need to be redone and the chain needs to be shortened right off the bat. no cable/housing cutter or chain tool? take it to a bike shop.if your new to biking, and stick with it, this bike will provide an educational experiance. and you cant beat the price.my real bike is dura-ace, 60cm, 17lbs, custom built with as much titanium & carbon fiber as i could fit on it. the saddle alone cost $250. on level ground, i can spin it to 30mph+, and i'm 59yo, 6', 215lbs. my normal day ride is a 15mi. time trial on a highway. just to let you know where i'm coming from. hope this is informative."
338412,1,My husband had purchased this pedometer for me a few years ago. Unfortunately I forgot to take if off before stepping into the spa. I purchased a different one while we were out of town at a local store and it was horrible! I ordered this one once again and love it! It is even more improved!!!!
156305,1,I thought it was too small and not high enough to be as a desk chair. but I was wrong. It is just right for me (5'8). I had a balance ball in my office but it was not comfortable for long time sitting. This one is. Love it.
33331,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
197065,0,"I am very happy with the scooter except that it lacks power to go up even small hills without overheating (so that you have to push it, let it cool, then press the reset button after a few minutes). It cannot operate 45 minutes continuously as claimed, more like 25 minutes, and has a much more limited range than the inferred 7.5 miles (45 minutes at 10 mph), more like 3 miles. It is fast and fun, but does not have the range and power I expected. It is basically good for level places unless you are willing to push it up hills."
378254,0,"i never used a bike rack before. my first time , i needed to bring the two bikes in for servicing. the first time i hooked it up, it seemed easy enough. the trouble was when i hit a bump. the rack jumped down. luckily it stayed high enough not to lose my cargo. the experts at the bike store assisted me and said the tieing the strap end in a knot to secure it would help keep it from moving. good idea, but this didnt work either. i will use it again and see if i can discover the correct solution. any suggestions?"
174413,1,"Believe it are not , but my husband loves these, we use them more than the boys. LIving out in the country & spotting deer across the pastures is so much fun, Thank you"
76884,0,"Some of the inside seams at the armpits had kind of a ""rats nest"" of the thread used to sew the garment together. The sewing has held up OK over several washings, but maybe they should ease off on the workers a bit and let them finish their work better. Overall, the t-shirt is comfortable and made with good material."
138166,0,"My 44.5 inch head fits this helmet perfectly. The Sept08 version helmet is very light weight and I like the visor. Four improvements I would like to see. A much easier to open and close chin strap clip, softer straps, longer straps and more padding at the inside top of the helment."
164277,1,The Jensen Waterproof Box is exactly what I needed for my Sony Marine DSC-60 Stereo. It mounted easily under my glove box in my Hewescraft SeaRunner and works well. I especially like the storage area for an iPod/music player or remote on the right. Highly recommend.
434623,2,"I purchased this combo pack, it seemed like a great idea. Unfortunately, the first day i used it, the tip broke off the rod. The reels seem like they are okay quality for the money, and the package is nice, but what good is it without the rod. The rod markings say it is medium weight, 6 - 14 lbs, but the true capacity is far less. If you are only catching pan fish, then this might work out for you. If you are hoping for something larger than 1/2 a pound, you should look elsewhere."
257635,1,"I've gotten back into biking after many years. This helmet adjusts to fit perfectly and provides a high level of protection (lots of coverage of your entire head). It doesn't have the childish look of most of the neon colored, wild shaped helmets you usually see in bike stoes. But it's what you would expect - this is a BELL helmet and BELL makes the best motorcycle helmets you can buy."
15364,0,"I bought the AC-15 Adapter to go with the Koolatron Compact Kooler but it does NOT fit--it is too big yet Amazon continues to link this Adapter to this particular Koolatron. It appears that the ""Wagan 5 Amp AC to 12V DC Power Adapter"" is the proper adaptor."
116081,1,"I've purchased Mack's Aquablock Earplugs several times because the fit is tight and they are so comfortable in the ear. Now, if I could only remember to take off my glasses before diving in!"
240393,1,"I must preface this review by saying I did not purchase this blade from Amazon.Anyways, I've had this knife for about 2 yrs or so. I love it. It's rugged (as I've dropped it numerous times). As for people complaining about the knife's FAST system not working correctly, I don't know. I can easily (with one hand) - take off the safety,tap the thumbstud and there's the blade.The clip I haven't used as I just toss the knife into a small drawstring bag OR into my pocket.The blade isn't that sharp so I had to give it a run through my sharpener.All in all a good EDC knife."
92117,0,"The Bushnell radar gun is a low end radar. OK for casual use for softball games and clocking cars, but with low sensitivity and questionable accuracy. I bought mine to gauge the speed of radio control gliders, but unless the glider flew straight at the radar and uncomfortably close, it wouldn't get a reading, so I sold mine to someone else."
276506,2,"I oiled all of the O-rings with the oil provided according to instruction. The first 200 rounds fired flawlessly...then it was all downhill from there. The marker then went to rapid fire for about 5 shots. I recocked it...and another 5 rapid fires. So I broke the weapon down, cleaned and re-oiled (in case I missed anything). Again the first 200 rounds or so fired perfectly. Then the cycle repeated itself two more times. I am in the process of returning the entire kit. PLEASE spend the extra money and buy something of quality. It's embarrassing/frustrating when your Discount gear fails you in the middle of the game and you have to watch from the sidelines. Please learn from my lesson. I now have to endure the hassles of repacking, paying shipping costs, and waiting for a refund."
107851,1,I have an older 7 year old Great Dane who's starting to get hip and elbow problems. Been adding this to his food and noticed a difference. I also supplement my youngest dane with the MSM to help with growth. Easy to give can be given with food or dissolved in water.

347883,0,"They don't make many fishing hats for women so it's hard to find a good fitting hat. This hat is a pretty one and people love the message but the size is a bit bigger than I can wear comfortably, even with the adjustable strap. Also, not the best shade of blue if you have a darker tan."
111306,0,"Even though the metal attachment combs say to use #30 blade, DO NOT DO IT! Use a #10 or #15! The combs seem to break the teeth off the 30 so easily. I've had TWO 30s busted because of using them under attachment combs, but the 10s never break under the combs.The 30 is great for doing 'clean face/poodle face' but be very very careful around lips! It will knick lips easily. Otherwise I'm not sure what this blade is for. I get by without it now. I do my poodle faces with 10s. much safer of course"
104076,2,"I purchased 4 reclining beach chairs w/canopy. Every single one broke. When the metal frame is inserted into the webbing on the arms, the frame ripped right through the webbing. The company replaced the four chairs and they, in turn, broke the same way. The company states that this is a known problem but offers no help other than to replace the chairs once more.To add insult to injury, within three days of using the chairs, the elastic cord required to hold it in the upright position snapped, the zipper on one of the pouch came off, and the loop on the canopy cover tore out. All this happended within the first day or two of use."
107685,1,"These are great pants. My husband and son love them but the 34&#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36&#34; or 37&#34; and the 32&#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34&#34;. My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer. I'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise, they're good sturdy pants at a good price. Not sure why they're so long."
459065,2,"There are plenty of us burly folks with thick necks and a muscle or two, who do not want to feel squeezed in our attire. This ungenerous sweatshirt is composed of thin fabric cinched on top by a too-tight neck. I should have read David Marvin's true and informative 1-star review. This is over-priced for the low quality. I've bought thicker, better quality sweatshirts from WalMart. That's how cheaply made this thing is. I can't tolerate a tight neck pulling on me all day like a rabid dachshund; totally uncomfortable to say the least. As the group Little Big Town sings on their CDThe Reason Why, ""There's a price for keeping me, I may be cheap, but I ain't free..."" This cheap fuzzy offering in larger sizes (2x, etc.) turned out better:Soffe Men's Classic Crew Neck Sweatshirt."
427181,0,This is my first review. Love the pack. Seems very sturdy.I would have given this four stars instead of three if it did not smell. I had to wash it twice to get most of the smell out of it. Made in india smells like diesel??? I ended up spraying the hell out of it with earth sent cover spray. That pretty much worked.

319297,1,"I like this board for the following reasons:Pros:-can list batting lineup in order from 1-16 batters-easy slide in and out names and change as game progresses and batting lineup changes-can clip board to dugout fence for viewing by players-Enough room to list substitutes at bottom of boardCons:-Cheap bolt snap made of soft plastic that will breakSummary:I like to use post it notes cut with scissors to 4 inches long by 3/8 high and affix to plastic slides. This allows names not to be smudged when pulling out plastic tabs.Highly suggest going to local hardware store and purchasing 4"" bolt snap made out of metal."
361335,0,"This is a good little computer, but the users manual absolutely stinks. The instructions are sparse and obscure, especially for setting the wheel size. My question to the Sigma Company: Why go to the trouble of manufacturing and marketing a nice computer but then not give your customers decent instructions on setting it up and using it?"
318939,2,This ad is very misleading I have written the seller and amazon so hopefully they will correct the information that will lead you to believe that this is a lure kit of some unknown quantity when in fact it is only one jitterbug and it's the small one at that. The shipping isn't worth it.
229306,2,"Record your progress*Monitor your results**Internet Connection RequiredThe above are actual words from my packaging.To not mention on the packaging that there is a cost to monitor your progress on the web I consider very misleading advertising. Keep in mind that this piece of information I only learned from a review posted here. If it is true that it costs many times the amount paid for the pedometer for the tracking service it is just as well that their website is causing troubles for me because I would not choose to pay.I spent the last hour of my life trying to navigate their website to start an account but finally gave up. I could not get to the account creation. The software downloaded and installed. When I try to install it again it says it is installed. The next screen says it is not installed. I tried reboot, uninstalling, setting my computer to accept all cookies, deleting cached web pages, and maybe some other things. (Ok, this is really my wife's pedometer and I wanted to do something nice for her but ""game over"")There did not seem to be any email or phone support. Maybe once you pay the big bucks they will help you. Again, I don't know because I was never able to make it that far.This pedometer is brand new. This is only a rating of the website and packaging information. I cannot fairly rate the actual pedometer."
406193,0,"The color is nice, but quality, style and texture not appealing. This item was given as a gift. Unfortunately, the receiver was disappointed. Compared to other similar fleece pants they own that are worn more often, but a different brand, are much preferred. These pants will be worn only for outdoor yard work...and not much else."
77032,0,"I picked this earguard over the other ones here on amazon because this one looks the best. I practice brazilian jiu-jitsu alot so my ears are taking a beating... this earguard should have been the answer but it is NOT.The chin strap keeps it from being pulled up but there is no head strap to keep it from sliding/pushing down. Today I found myself in a triangle choke with the earguards completely around my neck.This earguard also has a loop-velcro closure system that you cannot do by yourself, you will need your buddy to fasten it for you, unless you want it to be real loose of your head.This earguard might work well for wrestling but NOT for brazilian-jiu0jitsu or any other type of submission wrestling. You should get an earguard that has a top head support strap that keeps it from being pushed down your head."

415985,1,"I bought this because I liked the waterproof aspect, plus the fact that the cover keeps the lighter switch from being pushed accidentally.It lights in windy conditions and puts out a very intense flame. I carry it with me all the time and it's small enough to remain out of the way until needed.I highly recommend it."
293037,0,This grip is just ok. First off its not really rubber. More like a soft plastic. It's very hollow so all the sound of the internal mechanisms is amplified which is a serious problem if you use your pistol for any kind of hunting. Just cocking the hammer back makes a very deep clunking sound. However it does fit a lot nicer in your hand than a pachmayr. This grip places your hand lower on the hilt which I like because with a pachmayr the recoil caused the cyclinder to contact my thumb during shot which made it so I couldn't shoot it comfortably.
145874,0,"I bought two of these for my daughters (5 and 6) for Christmas.Sled 1, great tight has worked great 4-times sledding. Neat, best sled on the slopes, blows away all the other equipment as far as speed, distance, whatever.Sled 2, damaged in the box gouge in front- I decided to keep it any way and colored in with furniture touch-up. One side rail was very loose, if I wouldn't have tightened it, the rail would have broken off. When pivoting the sled, the front half came loose as described in other posts because the bolt was too short to engage the locking portion of the nut. This happened twice and taking all of the screws out was a pain. So, I called Mountain Boy, they were very nice and offered to send a new longer bolt, but also suggested I could turn the nut over. Their second suggestion worked.So, overall I'm not sure how to feel. I got these sleds on sale for $69 each. For a wooden sled of this caliber, that is a GREAT value- even with the problems. The challenge as I described to Mountain Boy is to improve their Quality Control in China. Overall, I'm still satisfied. Sled 1 I would rate 5, Sled 2 a 2, so overall I'm giving a 3.We will be sledding again today. I hope Sled 2 works well."

Overall, I am happy with this seat. No more pain!"

495622,1,"I own 4 of these. This is the best and most simple putting aid I've ever seen. The rounded design means that a putt that is a little off center will be diverted. The slope of the sides trains for the right force to put the proper pace on a putt. The depth of the cup trains for the right touch; keeping the putt in the cup requires correct control of pace. Changing the rings in the cup trains you to focus on the center using a progressively smaller target. My sons and I used two of these on the carpet for years to putt back and forth. Simple competitions made it fun. Our bulldog Winston loved the competition too. His enjoyment was to chase down a ball, scoop it up, and run away and munch on it. No electricity necessary.The inventor of this lived in Silver Spring, Md. This device should be put back into production because it is simply the best."

136379,1,"I started this program to get back into shape to go back into the military. I grew up on farms, was Active Army, and deployed 5 times, and I've never been in as good of shape as I am now after having done this program. Like everyone else, I gained muscle and lost a lot of weight, clothes fit better, and every part of my body looks good, especially my legs.I recommend this program for anyone wanting to get in shape and is willing to spend 2 months to do it. Since starting and sharing my progress online, I've found that several of my Facebook friends either have done or currently are doing the program, so that helps with the motivation.My favorite parts about Insanity: It is structured so you know what to expect. The videos in the first month are all around 40 minutes, and the second month is around 60 minutes. There are no weights or equipment to buy. Just have a towel, a bottle of water, and motivation to look and feel awesome.Some of the negative reviews on here seem to be short-sighted, and I feel the need to address some of their issues:-""Not for Beginners"": This all depends on your level of motivation because, as it is flashes across the screen and as Shawn T reminds you during the program: ""Go at your own pace, but push yourself."" I spent a lot of time in the gym and rucking (walking with a ruck sack on my back) in Afghanistan and then took 6 weeks off and did nothing when I got back. While I could lift weights, I was NOT in any sort of shape when it came to cardio, so I was back to being a beginner in that respect. At 7 weeks into the program (at the time of this review), I am doing pretty great with keeping up with the cardio now.-Joint Problems/Injuries: There is a lot of impact in this program due to the jumping exercises. HOWEVER, there are things you can do to minimize this, like substituting the jumping for lunges, squats, calf raises, butt lifts, or any other leg-intensive exercises that they show you how to do during the 9 weeks. Take some supplements like Glucosamine/Chondroitin and Omega-3. Do the static running exercises on a mat or do the exercises in a room with carpet and padding. Do NOT do this program on concrete.-No Results: If someone said they did this program and didn't get any results, then they're either lying or were shoveling fast food into their face. Like all weight loss programs, you still have to watch what you eat. The good thing about this program is that it is structured and is easy for you to plan out HOW and WHEN to eat based on the level of exercise. There is even an eating guide if you don't know how to properly diet."
174548,1,"I teach marksmanship and these are the scopes I put on my loaners. I field half a dozen of these every months and each rifle gets around 500 rounds through it. I've never had a problem with one of these scopes and neither have I heard of any of my students having a problem, many of them liked the scope so much that they went out and bought the same model without a complaint."
267485,0,"I love the bag's look...really cute! But I think it is not very well made. I would also like a small inside pocket for money, etc."
220088,1,"I have owned and reviewed all of Orion's Apex line of Maksutov-Cassegrain scopes: the 90mm, 102mm, and now the 127mm. All of them have similar virtues: solid, all-metal construction, great optics, smooth mechanical function with no focus shift that I've been able to detect, and very nice fit and finish. In short, they look, feel, and perform like top-of-the-line telescopes. I've used them in daytime and at night, photographed birds, mammals, distant landscapes, planets, and the Moon with them, and flown with them in my carry-on luggage.The Apex 127 is a sizable scope. The tube is 14.5 inches long and weighs 8.6 lbs without the finder, diagonal, or eyepiece. Eight-point-six pounds might not sound like much, but cradling that much telescope in one hand while I tighten the bolt on the mount with the other hand is enough to give me the heebie-jeebies, and I always breathe easier once the scope is solidly on the mount. Speaking of mounts, I see that the Apex 127 is often sold together with the Paragon-Plus XHD tripod. Some people may find that works for them, but I am very skeptical of that pairing. The problem is that the weight of the scope will tend to overbalance it if is mounted from below. I have mine side-mounted on an Orion Versa-Go II, and even then it had some teething problems. I originally had it bottom-mounted using an L-bracket adapter, but it would get out of balance at high angles, so I took off the L-bracket and went for a straight side mount. Now it's perfectly balanced and works like a dream; I can go from horizon to zenith with no balance problems and without moving my head more than a few inches.The plus side of the size is that 5 inches is a fair amount of light grasp, and for a ""small"" telescope the Apex 127 turns in impressive views of celestial objects. If you've only used smaller Maks before, you're going to be very pleasantly surprised at what the larger ones can do. A 5-inch Mak might seem like a counter-intuitive choice for a deep-sky scope, but astronomy author ""Uncle"" Rod Mollise has used one, a Meade ETX-125 he calls Charity Hope Valentine, in that capacity for years and regularly sings her praises. Of course with its long focal length the Apex 127 is not going to give the same expansive, wide-field views you'd get from a short-tube Newtonian or refractor, but at low power it frames almost all of the Messier objects nicely, and the ability to easily reach high powers means you can find the right level of contrast to tease out the more elusive faint fuzzies from the background skyglow.On brighter objects like the moon and planets the Apex 127 is simply dreamy. Images are sharp and contrasty and don't degrade at the edge of the field. In terms of resolved detail, mine rivals my 6"" Dob, which several folks have praised as a ""planet killer"". The long focal length and narrow light cone mean that almost any eyepiece will work well, even budget widefields that often underperform in faster scopes.Like the other Apex scopes, the accessories included with the 127 are a mixed bag. The bag itself is very nice, rugged, padded, with several external and internal pockets and a Velcro-adjustable padded divider for the main compartment. The 25mm Sirius Plossl eyepiece yields 61x and is a good start, but you'll definitely want some shorter focal length eyepieces for high-power work--I usually reach for a 10mm Plossl (154x) and 6mm Expanse (257x)--and something like a 32mm Plossl (48x) gives a bit larger true field of view and makes for a great 'finder' eyepiece. So far, so good.Things fall down a bit with the diagonal and the finderscope. The 45-degree prism diagonal is acceptable--barely--for daytime use, but stargazing is the ultimate test for optics and the diagonal just doesn't keep up. The very first thing you'll want to buy is a 90-degree mirror star diagonal. Even a cheap one will be a noticeable improvement over the included prism diagonal, and the scope's optics are good enough that you may want to invest in a medium- or high-end dielectric diagonal to get the full benefit.The finder isn't actually bad, just on the small side. With the long focal length and comparatively narrow true field of the Apex 127, you need a big finder that delivers a bright image over a wide field. I recommend a 9x50 finder (at least; slap on a 60- or 80mm finder and you'd basically have a rich-field/planet-killer combo). A right-angle correct-image (RACI) finder is nice because you can move your eye from the finder to the eyepiece and back without moving your head much or contorting your back. And a 9x50 RACI offers a wide enough field that I've never had a problem finding anything by just pointing the scope in the general direction and maybe sighting down the tube a bit before going to the finder.So in the final analysis the Apex 127 is a very nice telescope tube and comes with a useful bag and one decent eyepiece, but it's not quite ready for the stars as offered. You'll want a 90-degree mirror diagonal and a sturdy mount at a minimum, and swapping out the 6x26 straight-through finder for a 9x50 RACI will probably make your observing life a lot easier. Still, it's a terrific scope and easily good enough to be worth building an observing system around (and if you've already got those things and are just here for the tube, go ahead and 'add to cart'--you won't be disappointed). For the scope, bag, and eyepiece I would give it five stars; as the all-in-one-package-except-for-a-mount _system_ it is advertised to be, only four stars. It's still one of my favorite telescopes, and with a little forethought and attention I think it would make almost anyone happy. Clear skies!"

They looked worse and showed more wear than gloves I've worn for months. The gloves appear to be very thin or weak material. Too bad because I love the fit and the color choices."

My Son, who's 10 and small rode it on the driveway and back yard but on low grass seemed to go too slow, so he stayed on the hardtop.On the third morning 19th 10am he wakes up does a lap, stops and tries to start again, the rear wheel will not engage, it just spins.I read somewhere before that this happens to this bike and the MX500. So i blame myself somewhat.Alex"

287571,0,"I bought these and 2 pair of Russell at the same time to compare. I found the Russell preferable with just a little softer material and seam stitching as well as little bit loose fit in the seat. Russell also has a printed logo compared to the embroidered Champion (which feels like a small hard scab on the otherwise soft material). These were comfortable and fit well and they've worn well for the last 4 months. For me though, I like the Russell slightly more."
321017,0,"I originally bought this cap because I was afraid of hair getting snagged. (I have long, fine hair that falls out when pulled a lot) But when using it, the design seemed short enough to cover some of my hair. (I have a small head) It covers my hair tied up when when in attempt of diving or put my head in the water, eventually, I can feel the bubble inside the cap. Then, it comes loose often. So, if you're looking to keep your head dry, it will, if you can keep it on long enoughPoint is: I might have to invest on the silicone one. I just want to try swimming without having to put the cap back on several times. I like this lycra enough to not have my hair snag. They should make a bigger or longer"
198391,0,"I bought this gun about 2 months ago from[...] It came with the added supressor, scope (laser pointer to be exact), and a flash light they were all pretty well put together. The gun itself was about 200-210 fps and somewhat accurate. It had no iron sights which was a little dissapointing because the scope can get in the way sometimes. The battery life was good enough for me but not to good for pros in airsofting (this is just my opinion). The downfall of the gun is the durability, not even after 24 hours of use the gun broke and jammed! I had to take the whole thing apart to get it to work again. It gets worse... about 2 days later (3 days after getting the gun) it wouldn't even fire. I took it apart AGAIN and had to fix the motor. The day after that it did the same thing! Finally me and my mates got tired of it and sent it back. Overall the gun works fine in every way excluding durability i give it a 6/10, I wouldn't recommend it, I would recommend the M83 (M16 and can be found on this site) I have had it for a while and it works like a charm!"

436803,0,"I needed to order these shorts for my daughter to fit requirements of a fitness program she was going through. They fit her a little shorter than pictured on the manaquin (why don't they use real people in these pictures?), and so they didn't meet the requirements.Material is just your basic, thin stuff. But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her. I'm glad they are now using a read model. They held up for a few months before they ripped. They served their purpose."

Definitely stick with the 5.5 foot lite if you can find it.Updated: Have used this rod and a 6 ft version both for about the past 3 months and the inside of the last eye has fallen off on both. May be my last ugly stiks. Have 4 currently and have owned several more, but the quality seems to have gone down."
223727,0,"I made the mistake of hoping this light would be enough to light my way, rather than just get the attention of motorists and pedestrians. The beam is too narrow and not bright enough for anything but really slow riding in the dark. I think it's okay for being seen, but only okay. It doesn't blink, if you're into that, and the narrow beam spread means only folks directly in front of you will see the light from afar. Check out CatEye's excellent, compact, 3xAAA- and 3 LED-based HL-EL400 for something that blinks and has a wider angle of beam visibility. For a battery-based light to see with, I found Planet Bike's 5000X to be a much better value."

485109,1,"I first tried a WaterRower rowing machine at a gym and really liked it. The movement is natural and comfortable compared to other rowing machines I'd tried that use a different mechanism, such as gravity, to provide resistance. As you row, it makes a pleasant white-noise swooshing sound as the paddles push water around in the cylindrical reservoir. It looks nice too... especially next to the black metal and plastic design of typical exercise equipment.The construction of the Natural Rowing Machine model seems very sturdy. The assembly instructions say that after some initial use, the bolts holding the different parts of the unit together will need to be retightened, and I found this to be true. I've been using the rowing machine almost every day for several months and it has held up wonderfully: there are no strange noises or creaking, and it feels and moves just like it did when I first used it.One minor complaint I have is with the foot straps. They do an acceptable job, but I think they could have been designed a little better. After 15 minutes of rowing, they inevitably loosen somewhat."

253136,2,I ordered this sleeping bag after my daughter picked it out. She had picked it out because it was pink in color. Imagine her and my disappointment when the sleeping bag arrived for her birthday and was a deep wine color instead!Somehow the color is completely misrepresented. In addition my daughter noted that the inside material of the sleeping bag is also different from the image shown.Not sure who's issue this is but the product image is incorrect as the part number on line matches what was shipped.

359337,0,"Tiger Woods, hmmmm where do I start. I have owned and probably still own all the Tiger woods games ever produced, atleast for every year they were made for xbox, ps2, and xbox 360...The game itself is amazing. Heck you can even put your own face into the game. The career modes are fantastic, the graphics are excellent, and there are an abundant amount of golf courses that I will never even be able to see in my lifetime.The problem with the game is the Putting! A few Tiger woods ago, you could putt, it was still difficult to putt (had to line of the approximate inches, and feet), now you have to be a better putter while playing the game then you would need to be in real life while putting on the PGA Tour.I bought Tiger Woods 08 and have played it once, because the putting is so bad it makes me not want to play the game. I am disappointed that I spent 60 dollars on the game.If you can get past the putting aspect, the rest of the game is amazing.If you absolutely must have the game buy it pre-owned!"

None have worked. I want to load a 40 Cal Smith and Wesson Model 99 (8 round mag) and a 40 Cal Styer (12 round mag). I followed the makers recommendations (for size and fit as printed on the back of the prduct card) with all of the loaders. The mag is either too big or too small. They will not seat in the loader so that you can hold them and load them, one does not even fit the loader. Unless the maker is going to make one that fits these mags I am still loading by hand. So far this prodcut for me has been a waste of time and money."
188826,0,"When these were rec'd they were deflated and since we don't have anything with that pin hole size to inflate it, we had to wait over a week to use them so I could get to the store and buy something.

Once inflated the ball was great but to save myself time and money I shopped here, it ended up costing me extra time and money in the end."
231746,0,This was not my favorite workout. I have a large collection of workout DVDs and was very hopeful for this one. I have the two Peak 10 Cardio Strength DVDs and I love them so I thought I would try the Cardio only. The moves were a bit dancy or something for me that I felt that I was concentrating so much on the moves that I was not able to get an intense enough workout. I prefer the Amy Dixon Breathless Body DVDs that have more simple and intense moves for full cardio. I am going to try this one a few more times to see if it grows on me.

He told me I would have to send it back to Amazon. Anyway it was a terrible experience.

307325,2,"I found so many great reviews for Princeton Tec flashlights, so I was sure they would be pretty decent quality. But I was sadly disappointed. I bought two, the torches have pretty weak beams and burnt through batteries pretty quickly too. This was especially disappointing when scuba diving, which was the reason I bought them in the first place.The build quality is terrible, I assumed they would be fairly tough, as most diving equipment is, but they are made of cheap brittle plastic, and one of them has already cracked open. The on-off switch is a threaded lens-cap that you can tighten up to turn on, and loosening it turns the torch off, as with maglites. But in turning it on the cap has to be tightened to the point where it strains on the threads, and those threads are obviously pretty weak. One of the torches cracked all the way around the threaded plastic when turning the torch OFF (ie. when releasing this pressure). Not only is it almost totally destroyed (only a cm or so of non cracked plastic holds the lens on), it is useless for diving now.It's very annoying because the torches are advertised as being impact resistant, but this plastic is incredibly cheap feeling and is clearly not up to scratch.They are just not worth the price, there are better torches out there for less, and ones that are not made of such cheap materials. I will not buy anything from this company again."

I weigh 210.4 lbs according to my bathroom scale, and I noticed that the seat creaks/squeaks if I don't sit ""properly"" on it.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I am a female living on my own, and had to put this together all by myself, and I am not very handy. It was heavy, difficult to put both big pieces together, and thank heaven for the other reviewer who mentioned using a hammer to fit in the black plastic piece. Since I don't have any hammers lying around, I used my 5-pound dumbbell. Also thanks to the reviewer who mentioned pouring a little Windex through the foam handlebar tubings. I had to come back and go through reviews to figure out how to twist and turn it on. After the windex trick, it was a breeze.I kept telling myself after all this huffing, puffing and callused fingers to assemble this bike - which was a workout on its own - I had better use it, and use it for a while. Overall, it is a good piece of equipment, and I was sweating after my workout. Now I need to gear my mind up to the thought of assembling the Gazelle Edge I bought on here as well ... Whew! God help me!Enjoy!"
357316,0,"This set consists of really nice cookware. However, please look at the product size description. These utensils are very small. I guess that is a good thing for minimalists or those folks that go out light and alone. For me though, way too small. I could cook a nice meal for my hampster though."

458016,1,"If you are looking for the BEST freshwater lure that is guranteed to satisfy your lure needs, THIS IS THE LURE FOR YOU. This is the BEST and MOST REALISTIC lure that has ever been created. It has a tail action in the water, that all fisherman dream about. It can't get any more realistic than this lure.If you are looking to go fishing in a freshwater lakeI would suggest to get a 3.5"" or 4"", no bigger. Trust me the 5"" and 6.5"" are gigantic and are meant for GIGANTIC fish which not to many are stupid enough to bite a lure. If you and your kids are going for a nice boat ride or lakeside fishing, get the 3.5"" or 4"", it is plenty big.Although, now, on the Amazon website for some reason only 3 types of the lures are offered and the size is 4"". If you want different colors you can go to the megabait website and choose from all the different colors and sizes.I would have to say the 02 RAINBOW TROUT is the most likely canidate to attract the fish is what I have found.In conclusion, its plain and simple, if you want to CATCH a FISH this is the lure for you."
264898,1,"Nothing says I'm ready to pump some serious iron like a rocking head band. It's like Over The Top (featuring Sly Stalone) when he would flip his hat backwards it meant it was business time.

It's like a switch goes off in my head, nothing gets me more jacked.Word to the wise, make sure you remove it before you hit the tanning bed bro's."
412781,0,"I would actually give it a 2.5, and because bad reviews get plenty of attention, I will attempt to be as thorough as possible. First, much of this depends on how experienced you are at this type of exercising, and what equipment you've used. Although I am not a body-builder by vocation, I have lifted weights for many years, using a curling bar, and a Soloflex, with free weights. With that combination, I've been able to do many, many exercises, including just about everything this machine purports to offer.First, a few words about the legendary issue of assembling this. If you are related to Leonardo Da Vinci or have your own Saturday show on PBS, you'll have no problem. Otherwise, this company does a horrible job of providing instructions, leaving out important details. One can tell a lot about a company by its product-management face, and when the instructions contain mis-spellings from a Chinese outsource, there is reason for concern. One thing to note is that many of the pulleys simply will not go into the slots, especially brackets, without the use of a mallet. At times, this is very hard to do with one single person, especially in one particular case when you actually have to insert the pully UP into the bracket, so that your leverage is minimal. But more importantly, when you do have the machine totally assembled, the cable lengths ""may"" need adjusting. Well, they sure do. This is where Da Vinci comes in: if you are blessed with a brain that can look at ten cables and five interactive pulleys and figure out the permutation of adjustments required, more power to you. In my case, there was NO way to do it, because, alas, there simply wasn't enough cable. The Chinese brochure folks were kind enought to put the word ""important"" and an arrow directed to a pulley in the adjustment section, but I suppose it would take too much time to suggest actual adjustments to make. Fortunately there is a phone, and after patronizing me a bit, the gentleman did walk me through the process, and we concluded that I actually needed to be sent additional links (we are talking hardware here, not internet!), ie, for whatever reason my cable lenghths aren't sufficient. In general, the folks at Body Solid are responsive on email and on the phone. The fact that they will send you PDFs with alternative views just makes me wonder why these aren't included in the product in the first place.Regarding the mix of exercises and the performance. I have to say that I am disappointed with many aspects of this. The ergonomics of the seat, the leg extension, and the chest attachment do not work well for spacing. For example, for lat pulldowns, you need to sit on the edge of an inclining bench and somehow straddle the wide cushions of the leg extension. The chest attachment itself significantly increases the footprint of the item, and, parenthetically, if you can use any kind of bench with free weights, you are much better off than using this exercise. If you want to do front pulldowns (lat pulldowns but facing the bench and pulling the bar in front of your face) you need to wedge your legs through the ubiquitous chest contraption and again find a position on the angled part of the bench.Tricep extensions, the workhorse exercise for this muscle group, are also a bit clumsy, given the position of the leg extension, which blocks you from the bar, and forces you to lean forward.I like the row exercise on the low pulley, but note that for optimal results, you need to buy a stirrup handle. Same for the cable crossover (refer to poster with the happy lady in the chest section). I have absolutely no idea why there are foam cushions behind the vertical portion of the seat, so maybe there are mysterious exercises doable that the poster doesn't show.I will summarize this in the following manner, to be fair: if you are a relatively newcomer, who wants a broad range of exercises, and want just one piece of equipment under $1 000, this is good. If you already have a weight bench where you can do standard exercises, such as bench presses and military presses, and a curling bar for curls and upright rows, much of what this machine offers is sub-optimal. In that event, all you'd get out of it are the ""pulling"" exercises, such as the lat, rowing, and triceps exercices. If you work out avidly and have space, it may still be worth it in the long run.Small detail, but details say a lot: the caps on the end of the latbar are horribly designed, and pop off constantly, even though they are supposed to be threadable"

196987,0,"We bought two Razor e300 scooters for the two older grandchildren for their birthdays in Aug 2011. They were OK at the time. When the third grandchild's birthday came up about 3 months later, we did better research and bought him an eZip 450 by Currie. I would rank the eZip as 100% better than the Razor. Much better design, more rugged, more reliable, better battery run time, battery condition indicator on handlebars. I would never buy a Razor again unless it was less than half the price of the eZip."
180284,0,"I am participating in a 60 mile walking event, so was looking for a fanny pack/water bottle that I can use. On my first walk using the pack, I encountered a few issues. The first is that the water bottles are more towards the back of the pack, meaning that I could not reach them easily while walking. I had to shift the pack around in order to get to the bottles....something that will grow tiresome over a 60 mile walk! Also, the water bottles, when filled to capacity, are very cumbersome and heavy. I could feel them pulling the bag down and making it a bit awkward and uncomfortable (this went away when I dumped half of the liquid out). The bottles only have screw caps with a very large mouth...makes it difficult to drink while walking unless you want the water to spill all over your face. I have not yet looked into finding a pop-top lid that will fit. Lastly, the strap that holds the buckle is not of the same material as the actual pack. It is thinner and tends to dig more into your skin while walking. I did seem to adapt to it after walking for a bit, so am not sure if that is a minor drawback or a major one.The quality of the product is nice. I can see it being perfect for other uses (hiking perhaps, or maybe even biking). It just isn't suiting my needs as well as hoped."
52168,0,SOG is a great knife company. Everything I have owned from them is top quality. This example is just too small for my needs.
436033,0,My XL socks fit my long foot with one exception. The calf material of the sock is tight. I hope it lets-up after washes. I have a long build also. Thusly an average calf. Not a power calf.

410187,0,"Most of the products from this company come with printed exercises but not this. It has only a DVD. It has plenty of exercises on it but the DVD is difficult to use while exercising. There is no repeat feature and you have to manually go back to the main menu and re-select the exercise each time, several times until you learn the exercise. Whenever it comes to stretching-type exercises it is real easy to overdue them or position the disc just slightly incorrectly. Having to constantly get up to replay the exercise topic on the DVD just makes this extremely inconvenient. There is a small insert that says ""ATTENTION: If you have any issues with the operation of this DVD, DO NOT RETURN your product to the store"" and it gives a phone number and email address. Problem is, the DVD operates fine but its production and layout is simply bad. Typically, this happens when a company fails to conduct sufficient customer feedback prior to a program's release.All of this company's products come with warnings to consult professionals and you certainly should with this product. Although it looks like a simple device, many of the exercises use it under the small of your back. This is not a good idea for someone with lower back issues. Best to check with your physical therapist or doctor before attempting this type of exercise."

482446,1,I love the KO design Kershaw knives. The assisted opening is a great feature. This is an attractive knife that is easy to operate. The blade material is durable and has decent edge retention. The frame lock handle is comfortable. This is an undervalued knife IMHO. It is not as expensive as some other mass produced quality knives (Spyderco comes to mind) and therefore I will subject it to some harsh use.
352332,0,"I love the helmet. Light, plenty of air. But the front shield was loose when I received it and not it doesn't stay on right. I might glue it, or even send it back. I'm not sure. But the helmet is awesome if it works right."
271181,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."
368863,0,"Compelling and beautiful watercolor graphic looks a bit washed out on the stark white t-shirt. Despite this, the printing is very good, and well placed on the shirt.

15955,0,"There is nothing wrong with the product but I have doubts whether it is suitable for pike predator fishing. I feel that this product is really more suitable for sea-fishing. The wire is very springy and in my opinion virtually impossible to knot, but probably ok to crimp. I have no doubt it is tough and will not kink but I feel a softer wire is required for UK freshwater fishing. Additionally, titanium wire would probably make a good lure trace (as it won't kink) but I would have concerns regarding concerns of damage to a pike's teeth as the wire is extremely hard. I probably won't use the samples that I have. I have given the product 3* not on the basis of the quality of the product but because I think that there are better products for pike fishing."

I finished the job using a pair of needle nose pliers that held the nut fine, even though they came from a very cheap tool set. I'm waiting to hear if Gerber will cover it as a warranty case. Other than that, I liked the looks and features and it has Leatherman beat with the price."
93614,2,"Nice to find a partly wool sock in sensible sizes. I wear size 6 Women's shoe. DH purchased a 2-pack of these as a test for me. We got the smallest pair of these available. They fit right.Pros: These fit the best of any sock I remember owning in quite a while (size 6 woman's, slim legs). Decent energetic feel (support). Medium cushion effect in the foot.Cons: Seam at toe is not neatly done. The seam across the top at the toe terminates in a little ""tail"" or ""ear"" on each side, each longer than 1/8 inch. These press into the side of the big toes and the top of the little toe!. I had to turn these socks inside out in order to be able to wear them. Too bad, it would really be nice to be able to wear these with the loop cushion side toward my feet, the way they were intended to be worn!Needs more wool and less nylon.Bottom line: These are okay INSIDE OUT under soft slippers just wearing around the house, but I cannot imagine walking very far wearing these under hiking boots. Wearing inside out or not on a hike, these would probably make blisters on the big and little toes."

397494,0,I like the idea of the spring end and how it can be protective of the motor. I really don't like the hitch mechanism where it attaches to the trailer. Having to always reach under a dripping boat to attach the transom saver is not the best design.

216394,0,"I bought two of these sleeping bags in February and just got them out last week to use for a camping trip later this month.They're bigger than average, and soft (cotton, not nylon) which is exactly what I was looking for.The only downfall is that the Coleman name isn't what it used to be. One of the bags is just fine. The other bag has a broken zipper. One of the teeth is crooked on the side near the bottom, leaving a 4"" opening when you close the zipper.

This doesn't bother me, as black and green are primarily what I will need but the picture should be product-correct. My biggest complaints are that the sewing supplies come in a flimsy plastic bag inside the pouch and it only comes with one needle. I suppose that would be fine for some people,but I used an empty Altoids mint can to store the items in, added 5 more needles that varied in size and a few larger spare buttons. The can fits in the pouch pefectly. I give it 3 stars because of the price and the thin plastic bag."

226354,0,The pedal exerciser was recommended by our physical therapist. It proves to be a simple device that provides convenient ways to exercise. My only criticism has to do with the screw adjustment that regulates the power needed to pedal. When the screw is tightened and the pedal action made stiffer the device does not work smoothly. Maybe with further use the jerkiness will subside and the pedals work smoothly. This flaw notwithstanding we consider it a good value for the price and very usable.
172365,0,"The device works as people have explained, abstractly to me. But it totally lacks of instruction of any kind.

505579,0,"The concept of the heart rate data logger is great, and the unit itself is very small and discreet. I usually wear it on my arm, clipped to the strap of my mp3 player. When it works, it works well with my old Polaris heart rate strap. The price from this seller is outstanding, and even Oregon Scientific's MSRP is is a bargain compared to what other manufacturers want for their heart rate monitors with data logging capability.[The following is an update of my original review.] I have had this unit since early February 2009, and exercise about three to five times per week. I initially had several problems but have been able to resolve all of them to my satisfaction. I would now rate it at five stars instead of three (but the edit function won't let me change that!) However, I had to fix the problems myself because my attempts to contact the manufacturer using their web site still have not been answered.1. Initially the software would appear to download data but nothing would get recorded in the database. I tried tweaking various user settings and options and finally got a successful download after setting the software to NOT automatically clear the device memory after download and NOT automatically synchronize the device date/time after download. Now that the controls are set that way I get a successful download every time.2. I did have a problem where it failed to record sessions after the first couple. Attempting to turn it on caused the LED to flash green once and then red twice, a code that is NOT described in the user pamphlet. I knew the chest strap was working because my Polar monitor watch was receiving the signal at the time I was trying to turn the data logger on. I eventually noticed that the manufacturing date code appeared to indicate June 2006 so I decided to try a new battery. That fixed the problem.I have noticed one data anomaly (heart rate up to 235!) which was probably caused by interference from monitors worn by other people. (It was a particularly crowded day at the fitness center.) When doing statistical analysis I will just treat those points as any other outlier.Based on using it for several weeks (after installing a new battery) I would now rate the PRODUCT at FIVE stars for performance and quality. (But don't ask me to rate the manufacturer's technical support!)NOTE TO AMAZON MODERATORS: this product from this seller is classified in Kitchen equipment! It should be listed with FITNESS equipment, like the other entries for this product by other sellers!"

397879,1,"I ordered the silver model .. I ride a mountain bike, and I like this helmet :)it has some white flowery prints on the back, but I am more than confident in myself, and not to mention I kinda like it.I have since covered it with stickers, and there's scratches and mud all over it, but that just proves that it has been put into service, and tested thoroughly.I had one of those helmets like you see the roadbikers wearing, but I just did not like it, this one is great!It comes with extra pads for the inside too, which not only make the size more customizable, but you can also replace the pads if you sweat them up and they stink. I haven't swapped mine out yet, but I plan to soon."
379041,2,"I bought this item for my husband and I to use for work. We are both paramedics and send most of a 24 hour shift in the medic truck. The plug for this broke the first time I used it. We were able to fix the plug so that we could use the box and were disappointed in the amount or lack of heat. The ad for this box claims that you can cook in this, you can't! It does get warm enough to warm up leftovers if you have an hour or so the let the food sit in it. You have to turn the food several times to get the food to warm up evenly. The box only worked for about 1 month of time. We only used it on days that we worked which is one day out of every three days so we only used it about 10 times before it just stopped working altogether. I would not waste money buying this."

508841,0,"When I ordered this, I expected the traditional sock knife work in the kilt hose top. These knives typically run between 6-8 inches long and are fairly thin. This particular product is more of the scottish dirk that is meant to be worn on the belt. It is in no way a sgian dubh."

390256,0,"Great product and fairly quick shipping. Does exactly what one would expect a sweatband to do - but I gave it only three stars due to the cost of shipping. The shipping was actually a bit more than the cost of the headband! Rather silly, especially since it is such a small item."

157121,0,"While this cover definitely adds some extra padding for your derriere, it is meant to be used with a fairly large bike seat. Since most larger bike seats also include padding, this cover seems pretty extraneous to me. My small, narrow, unpadded seat became something of a hazard when I added this cover to it, because it was then small, narrow, padded, and slippery! The cover slid around on the seat and my biking pants slid around on the silky cover. I returned the product to Amazon after a few rides with continuing saddle sores, and I've now invested in a new, larger, padded seat--for almost the same price as this cover.All this being said, if you already own a wide bike seat that could use a little extra something then this might be your solution."
415361,0,"I bought several pairs because they were cheap and I just needed some shorts for the gym. I bought grey, black, navy, and green. The colors are pretty much accurate to the pictures.The material is thin, but I prefer something light-weight for working out. The elastic band doesn't bother me at all.I will say they are SHORT and SMALL. I generally wear a small and I ordered large for these (though a medium probably would have worked too). And they are very short - as in ""be careful when you're stretching"" short. I tend to wear them around the house all the time though since they're super comfortable."
6510,0,"The first time I played this game I was hooked. I enjoy playing on the career mode. You get to controll just about everythnig a real mlb player can do. From asking for a trade, signing a big contract, and to trashing your team's moral. Now I was doing real well with my created person. I was on pace to break the single season hr record and drive in a load of runs. But there was a glitch in the game. It suddenly froze on me and I lost alot of progress. Now it might have been my system, but hearing from friends and other reviews this seems to be common with this game. Don't get me wrong this game is alot of fun. Just be aware of this glitch."
174367,2,"I ordered this item in May for bird watching. Did not get to use it until 1st weekend in June... past the return time frame. Each of the sides of the binocular work very well, but independantly. On a person with 20/20 vision, if you focused the right eye, left was out of focus. If you focused the left, the right was out of focus. The result was similar to trying to bird watch after doing 25 shots of Jaegermeister."
120575,0,"Tennis game has been made available on console systems as early as for the 8-bit Nintendo (as far as I remember). So why not table tennis? The only good reason I have come up so far is that table tennis is not a very well known and loved in this country (US) as comparing to tennis.I love playing table tennis and with the above reason, I definitely give Rockstar credits for making this game available for the Xbox 360.These are the Pro's and Con's of the game:Pro's:1) Fun sport. It's table tennis! It's different.2) Graphic is good.3) There is no learning curve. It's very simple to play.Con's:1) There is no career mode.2) The game mode is too simple. There is no ""upgrade"" in this game. Meaning the game wasn't designed to allow you to use either money or points (or your progress) to buy or invest in better equipment.3) The tournament is very simple. The game just shows the tournament tree instead of making it look like you really enter one.4) It is a little sluggish to move the player.5) Only two view modes (near or far).6) No tournament for double.7) There is no choice for picking either shake-hand or pen-holder style (the way you hold the paddle). You just pick the pre-built player with his/her holding type.I guess for its price $39.99, I can't expect much out of it. After all, it's still a fun game to play.I hope you enjoy."
380353,0,"I started out with the basic HJ-112 model that didn't have the software and loved it so wanted to upgrad to this one. I found the computer software didn't allow any changes that I wanted to do but still liked how I could keep track on-line.My only complaint is that the battery for this and the HJ-112 one is that they don't last as long as Omoron said they would. The HJ-112 did last almost 1 year but this one didn't last 6 months. When I replaced the batteries they still lasted only a few weeks.Needless to say was very disappointed in it. I saw prior reviews, after I bought it that said the amount of time of batteries was about how long mine lasted, but someone had contacted Omron and was told that the pedometer stays on even when the screen is blank and that's why they don't last long.I don't want to have to buy batteries at $4 a piece every month or so so I've stopped using this and the other one and bought their Hip one which is better because it's smaller & only has one button to push to get the info. I just write down my numbers on my own excel spreadsheet because you can't go back into the software program and add anything to it.If you have money to change out the battery constantly then this is an excellent pedometer if not try their HIP one instead."
425236,1,"I own two Fobus holsters, one for my Kimber 1911 and the other for my Ruger P-345. These holsters are very comfortable to wear with no pinching or scratches to the pistol. This product offer confidence that your weapon is held securely and at the same time you are able to draw and holster quick and smoothly. I wear it under a long T-shirt for concealed carry and use it while driving in the front position so it can be seen per CHL regulations. I highly recommend Fobus."
183495,2,"I am not very happy with my new pedometer. It falls off all the time, the face plate comes off and I have a very hard time making it stay back on. The spring has now broke from the clip, so the pedometer won't even clip to my pants anymore. I have to carry it in my pocket and it is too big for that. I am disappointed with this purchase!"

435992,2,"this stone was not flat. when i put it on a glass surface, one corner sticks up. that makes it useless for sharpening, which bad because this is a 'sharpening stone' and has no other function. it should at least be manufactured in such a way that it does what its made to do...UPDATE - I did get a replacement from Amazon and have been using the two sided stones (extra course/course + fine/extra fine) with excellent results. I see no reason to try any other brands or sharpening systems. I suggest you confirm that you get a 'flat' stone by putting it on a glass table to make sure it sits flush on all corners. Once you confirm that it is indeed a flat surface, then its a great tool."
472085,0,"The glasses are very inexpensive, but you might find the same quality at a lower price elsewhere. I thought these would compare to Bolle's, but I don't think they do."
405440,2,"We ordered this for our 3 & 5 year olds. I read the other reviews but felt optimistic. It came today and every negative word is true. It was packaged horribly, the ball is too big for the wickets, the wickets randomly pop open, and the balls don't fully inflate into their fabric skin making them wrinkly and unable to roll straight.Its redemptive value lies in the fact that you can use 4 poles per wicket to make the set work, but that only gives you 6 wickets instead of the usual nine. Despite its fallbacks and the cheap nature of the product (it definitely will not last the whole summer!) we had a good time with the set today.Caveat emptor!"

260982,1,"My trusty waveceptor databank died and Casio no longer makes it, so I needed a new watch. The watch works well and looks good. Removing the extra links was mildly challenging. (it took about 10 minutes with a pocket knife.I live in Florida where the time signal is weak and this watch will not set at the same location as my old one, but I found another place where it sets itself without problems.The face is handsome and generally easy to read. There are 2 small digital dials that display battery state and active functions that are a little small and hard to read. There is a larger dial that ticks off 5 min increments in time mode and 5 second incremants in stop watch mode. What utility this serves is beyond me. Casio likes to put querkie things on their watch faces and I guess this falls in that catagory. I just wish the other dials that actually serve some function were the same size.Bottom line its a big hulking black watch that looks cool and works well. Hence the reason I have christened it the TIMENATOR."
73797,0,"I purchased a ball for $10 from Wal Mart and didn't feel it had any stability and was very flimsy. The gym I use trains with the Spri brand so I thought this would be similar if not the exact ball. The quality was great, but unfortunately this is not the size I am used to hence the 3 star rating.I am 5'5' and the recommended size is 55, but the 55 in my gym and the 55 I am looking at are 2 different sizes. I am sending this one back and ordering a 65 instead. I am not sure if they have a different product line that they use for professionals, but I am very disappointed.This ball inflates to roughly double the size of a beach ball, and when seated you aren't high enough off the ground to do many of the moves effectively. Forget doing bridges, you might as well do them on the ground for all the height you get."

494960,0,"Okay, we all agree the Sigg bottles are terrific. They are fun, and because of the variety of graphics everyone always knows whose is whose. The water tastes GREAT, the tops really are leak proof, and you and your kids will love them. HOWEVER the smallest size bottle is just too small, even for a young child. If you are putting this in a lunch box and need the small size so it will fit, okay, but otherwise, even my three year old found the small children's size useless, and he has no problems drinking from the larger ones. Really THINK about how little .4 or .3 liters is before deciding that this bottle holds enough water for your little ones. I ditched all the small ones and bought the mid sized adult ones for my kids."

82198,0,"I needed more running/work out shorts, and I couldn't find anything to really beat this price. I love soffes, specifically because they ""move with your body"". They're normally not too baggy, falling down, or not fitting in those ""awkward"" areas.Either I've gotten to be a smaller size, or these shorts are knock-offs...because these shorts don't fit me like my other soffes. They're awkwardly baggy in the crotch, the bum isn't defined, the legnth is a bit longer than the others (even when ""properly"" rolled up).The main pro is that the material is very soft and comfortable. So I could see myself wearing these to the gym, and maybe even to bed on a warmer night.So bittersweet? I guess."

The price was really great, the best one I could find all over the internet for one week, and it was a great deal.It's huge, I was walking over several cities for two weeks carrying +45 pounds on it, and it worked perfect. It didn't matter that I was buying things in every city I was, I always found a place to put it on the backpack.The only thing that's is really a shame is the fact that it is heavy, but even like that it wasn't a ""surprise fact"", it is shown in the details of the product, so....Until now, it has been a great deal, I should wait for one year to see if keeps working great in that time."

240910,0,"First, of course, this is no substitute for a goodLeatherman. Still, it's very useful, with only a few weaknesses.It's solidly built. The knife, the saw, the can opener, are all tools I've used many times camping and outdoors. I use the pliers nearly every week for household projects, or when working on bicycles, or various other handyman activities - which is not to say that I am a very handy man. I like these pliers better than my other stand alone pliers in fact. This one has more heft and solidity.Of course most of the tools are no substitute for the real things - the scissors, for example, are pitiful and almost useless. The screwdriver and hexwrench attachments are pretty wobbly, and are the weakest aspect of the whole design. Still, I like the fact that with this in my pocket I've got a number of tools at hand, and while some may not be the best tool for some jobs it is much better than nothing - especially when I'm on the road and really have nothing else. For a one-piece multi-tool at a very fair price, Gerber is not a bad option.The one drawback is that some of the blades are a bit tricky to get open."

451760,0,"Length:: 9:51 MinsThe video is long at almost 10 minutes, so here is a short break down:0:00-2:10 : Introduction, keypad operation, and some quick fixes to issues that I had upon delivery2:10-End : Tear down and display of door locking hardware, discussion of security concerns-----I bought this safe to store a loaded handgun for relatively quick retrieval, and I'm going to depart from a number of the reviews here in that I'm not convinced of how secure this safe is. It is unquestionably more secure than keeping the gun in an unlocked desk drawer or the like. It's also significantly larger than a handgun and therefore more difficult to hide, so it could attract attention. The information that I provide below and in the video is to educate you if you didn't know it already (like I didn't when I bought this), just so that you can make an informed purchase. This safe might be perfect for you, or it might be completely inadequate.If your goal is to keep young children out, then I'd recommend this safe and call it a good value assuming that you're smart about hiding the keys from your kids. Young kids shouldn't be able to get into this safe.If your goal is to keep teenagers or thieves out, then my recommendation begins to drop assuming that your teenagers are anything like I was when I was that age - inquisitive, interested in solving puzzles, and with some spare time. Below are some things to be aware of just so that you know about them (I didn't know any of this until I spent about 30 minutes on the web and YouTube, so it's out there for your kids and crooks to find quickly and easily).Potential Security Concerns:- Security Code Reset: There are methods to reach the reset button to the dialpad from outside the safe, giving someone entry into the safe without knowing the code. In the video at about the 8:30 mark, I show how to use a twist-tie to defeat this attack.- Lock Picking: This safe can be opened with a single key that overrides the keypad, meaning that there is a single lock to pick. You (and anyone) can research online how to pick this kind of lock, and you might be surprised how easy it can be. You can disable the key function by removing part of the mechanism inside the door, but then you risk locking yourself out.- Safe Bouncing: This is the method of opening this type of safe by imparting a shock on the door (e.g. with a hammer). I show in the video the basis of how this works. From what I saw in the mechanism when hitting the door, it looks like it would be possible with this safe. However, in fairness to this product, I admit that I have not yet gotten this to work on this safe. [UPDATE 2011/02/09: After a couple of minutes of practice tonight, I bounced the safe with a rubber mallet. It was not difficult at all, so just be aware of it.]That said, it's probably perfect for keeping out younger children - and there are some nice features.Pros:- The beeping on the keypad can be disabled. That's really nice- Fairly small and can be placed on a shelf in a closet or pantry- Can be bolted to the surrounding structure (on the bottom and/or back face) and comes with the bolts- Comes with the batteries for the keypad- Comes with two copies of the key used to override the keypad in case the batteries are low or you forget your codeI had some issues when the safe was delivered but here are some easy fixes for a few shortcomings that you might experience, too:- The shelf is held in place by two (one on each side) plastic inserts. My safe arrived with one of the plastic inserts broken, and the shelf was rattling around as I unpacked it. Given how it was packaged (and how delivery companies transport goods), I wasn't suprised. I secured the shelf in place easily with a twist-tie.- The door was loose when closed and would clank (it is metal on metal, after all) when I touched the dial or entered my code. Not what I want when trying to be covert. The two bumpers on the door were overly compressed (perhaps during shipping), and I replaced them with more solid bumpers that I had bought at Home Depot for my kitchen cabinet doors (similar tothese). The door is nice and snug now.Overall, well worth $60-$70 for piece of mind with young kids. I do not recommend relying on this to keep out a burgler or inspired teenager, though.UPDATE 2011/08/07: I want to give a hats off to Stack-On. While trying out a way to make this a bit more secure, I damaged the circuit card inside the door. I contacted Stack-On, told them it was my fault, and asked how much it would cost to get a new one. They immediately replied that they'd send me another one for free (not even a charge for shipping). Totally unexpected and much appreciated - that's outstanding service, IMO. It arrived within a week and works perfectly. Thanks, Stack-On!"
206356,0,"This product does what it is supposed to do, but the design is awkward after comparing it to the Yakima and other brands. It has a pin that is inserted through one end, and a wire that holds it in place, while the other designs don't have a separate piece you have to insert, so their easier to use.The main problem I had with it, and the reason I won't use it and got the Yakima adapater bar, is that even though it is coated to help prevent scratching, it scratched up my handlebar stem very badly. I even had to put some electrical tape over the pin to prevent that from scratching too.I won't use it again and I really love the Yakima adapter bar--much smarter design and more protective of my paint on my Trek bike."
236021,1,"I've worn these shorts for years and am so glad they still make them. I like the longer inseam, they tend to stay in place as opposed to riding up.

173312,0,"Initially, this is a fantastic toy for a 2-4 year old boy, but only for about 2-5 playing sessions.The problem is that the rockets don't last for very long. They are made out of an aluminum vellum type material that mis-shapes easily. Once the rocket is ""wrinkled"", stepped on or crunched, it becomes misshapen and no longer launches because of too much surface tension with the launcher. The rocket needs to be made of a material that is more flexible so that they will stay perfectly round for a longer period of time.As is, the owner must replace the rockets after about 2-5 bouts of extended play.It would be a great toy if it lasted longer."

259322,0,"Compact, easy to carry; however, not worth the price tag they've put on it to me. I would like to see it priced at 3-4 dollars as I can get a cleaning cloth for my glasses for about that price and what's the difference? I used this little cloth though and it did a good job of cleaning the fingerprint off my lens. I didn't have to rub and rub as with some other cloths. Two passes and it was clean. So the little thing works great! I also wished it was not sewn to the inside of the bag as it won't let go of the bag as you clean and who wants a hard plastic piece bouncing around all over their camera equipment. I would like to see this cloth a little bigger to comparable with the price and would like to be able to remove it completely from the bag."

484607,0,"I purchased the Midland AVPH1 Open Face Helmet Headset for Midland GMRS paired with the Midland GXT720VP3 2-Way 30-Mile 22-Channel Radiosas a communications devices for scooter trips. They are not very loud. They are easily drowned out by wind and vehicle noises when used with an open faced helmet. To be fair they were only tested twice on busy freeways both times.VOX is not a good idea on the freeway! Every truck or car that passes activates the VOX and transmits that noise. Perhaps in a quieter area like a country road they would be less likely to activate - I haven't tried this yet.I will try placing something behind the ear speakers to bring them closer to the edge of the helmet padding to reduce the distance between the ear and the speaker this will probably help quite a bit. I was disappointed that even on full volume standing still it was difficult to hear. There simply is not enough volume out of the box, to be used as motorcycle communications devices.Midland AVPH1 Open Face Helment Headset for Midland GMRS"
469148,0,"Bought this item along with a few other different types of Mustad fishing hooks on the premise that they were from a quality Norwegian brand. Well, out of the few different hooks bought these were the only ones not made in Norway, but rather made in China. I am very disappointed in that discovery. I don't know how the quality compares with the other hooks, so they may still be good in and of themselves... but it sure is a big disappointment when you are informed of a quality Norwegian product, buy into them with that expectation, and then find out some of the products aren't actually Norwegian made but Chinese."

308930,0,"Not sure why they title this with a ""Built-In Pump"" because the pump is not built-in. Coleman might want to employ better Quality Control on these things.Pros:It's double-tall so you don't feel like you're sleeping on the floor. You don't have to climb out of bed.The valve is easy to close, losing little air while stopping it up.It was more comfortable than a sleeping bag on the ground.Nifty ""roll-up"" feature helped store it a little easier. Cool idea to attach it to the bed so you don't lose it.Cons:We had to fill it back up after the 1st night of use. I found out the same thing happened to one of our camping friends on the same model so this isn't a one-time deal.There was no ""built-in pump.""The air pump provided only works when plugged in to an outlet so it makes it a hassle when you're camping. No batteries or car cigarette lighter attachment included.Caves in the middle when it loses air. I'm not sure what can be done about that but it made for an uncomfortable way to sleep.Overall, I guess I'll deal with the issues because I shelled out $60 for it and it seems from some of the reviews that I might get a worse unit back if I try sending it in for a replacement.I will not buy this brand again and will check out more reviews for my next purchase."
392141,2,"There was nothing wrong with the functions; however, the wrist band that i received was gray. One of the reasons why I got it was because people said it looked aesthetically pleasing and it was okay to wear it when you are not working out. The images on the site show that the wrist band is black which looks nice, but the gray wrist band makes the watch looks really ugly. Decided to send it back, which was the first time i ever had to do that when i bought something online. They weren't able to replace it, only able to refund me."
69403,2,"I bought these skates for my 4 year old to take lessons with. I figured even cheap skates would be better than those horrible rentals. They are but not by much. First, I bought 2 sizes bigger than her shoe size (and one size bigger than the rental skates)thinking they would last a little longer that way. Thank goodness I did because they just fit! She wore them for the first time today at lessons and the ankle support of one of the skates has already started to collapse. Part of me is not surprise, but I had hoped they would last longer than one hour of skating!"

205886,1,"This spare tire mount bike rack is amazing, as long as you have one of the select vehicles with which it is compatable. I had it on my 1995 Isuzu Rodeo in about 30 seconds, tight and secure even with the spare tire cover on. The way it fits on the tire is stable and secure, and the two straps hold it on tightly, with NO movement whatsoever. The only issues are minor:1) the innermost bike holders are right against the spare tire, so they are pretty much unusable. However, they are only needed if you plan to carry three bikes on this rack. I only plan to carry two, so this issue will cause me no trouble.2) the built in straps on the bike holders are great for holding the bike onto the carrier, but you might want to utilize an additional bungee cord around the bottom of the bikes to prevent them from flopping around and to keep them more stable on the carrier.These two issues are just minor heads-ups, this carrier is wonderful, very easy to mount and use! Happy biking!"

438314,2,They look like they would work nice for my needs but they are way too small. I got them for me to use but they won't even fit my wife who has much smaller hands than I do. For the price I paid for them it is not worth paying return shipping to get my purchase price back so I will give them to a child that can use them.
269718,0,"I've owned a number of exercise bikes over the past 20 years. All the bikes I have owned during the past 12 years have had much more advanced consoles than the Marcy bike - for example, they allowed you to set a timer, had pulse-reading fuctions (even the real cheap ones under $200), etc. I had no problem assembling the bike (or disassembling it for return for that matter). The main reason I returned the bike was the low maximum resistance offered.This is a pretty basic bike. If you are just beginning, I'm sure this bike will be fine for awhile."

So, I bought this one which is more expensive than most other 24 inch bikes in the store or at Amazon.com, and most of all, beared a German name. Well, The first thing I noticed is that all brand information on the bike are printed on transparent plastics and then pasted onto the bike. The components are also apparently cheap looking, and --- not made in German!There was not a single review when I decided to buy this one. I really hoped I could read other people's review then. Hopefully, this review will help you make better decision when shopping a bike for your children.One most important thing is that this is not a bike for child at all. Due to the frame size, one need to be at least 5 feet plus to ride this bike."

432283,0,I ordered this mounting kit to mount my watersnake assault trolling motor to my 162 Scout Sport Fish. The mounting kit worked well but i ended up remounting without it because the four mounting screws just were not enough to hold my trolling motor as secure as i wanted it. I liked how it worked and if i had known that one kit would not do the job i would have ordered two. So end result... if your thinking of using this kit order two because one is not enough to properly secure the trolling motor to the boat (at least in my situation) otherwise it's a good product.

They are good quality, thick enough to be warm, but not so thick that they ""don't breathe"". For the price, especially since these will be something that gets dirty pretty fast in my usage, it's a steal.I'm a fairly big guy of average height, and I found the XXL sizing to be spot on for me and for my intended usage. Other folks of different proportions or intended usage may have a different view of the sizing. I wanted the shirts somewhat oversize for ease of mobility and better breathing when working up a sweat, without being too baggy and being in the way."

I mainly purchased this because it was on sale. I'm glad I made that purchase."

481369,0,What can you say about a seam sealer. Goes on easy enough and sticks to silicone treated materials. I am not fond of the feeling of the seam after treatment (feels tacky even though it isn't) but the instructions say that can be cleared up with some unscented talc.
193595,0,"* probably could do with sharpening right out of the package* good value for the price - for me, it's worth the sharpening effortBUT* the handle is TOO SMALL - I don't even have that big of hands (I'm a 5'8"" woman in her twenties, ring finger size 7, if that means anything to you) and the handle is much too narrow. I like knives with handles that are a little rounder - this one is very rectangular.* the blade also seems a little short, although it says clearly how long it is so I probably should have known that...All in all, I like a paring knife I got from IKEA much better :-)"
125314,2,This set was supposed to come with eight 3-star 40mm ping pong balls but it did not. There were places for them in the plastic packaging but they were empty. The odd thing was that there is a plastic security cord that keeps the zippers closed so this error must have occurred at the factory. Returned for refund and ordered another one. Fingers crossed.

93404,1,"Being left-handed, I've always liked these reels. Maybe it's how I hold the rod, but it's always felt slightly awkward trying to reach the line on reels without the little pin to hold it back. The pin also helps people, especially children, who are just learning how to cast.The gear ratio might be a little low for people who need a super fast retrieve, but, as I mostly use diving crankbaits, it's not an issue for me.I recommend opening these up a couple of times a year for cleaning/lubrication as they do tend to get noisy if you don't.I gave Quantum the benefit of the doubt in my rating. Because of the need for constant lubrication and the fact that they're not as durable as, say, the Shimano reels I have, I would rate them 3 1/2 stars if I could. But that pin tips it up to a 4.I bought a couple of these because they had the rear drag model pictured. Quantum stopped making them years ago, and I didn't really think I'd get 'em. The front drags are still nice. I just thought it'd be nice to let people know in case they were really looking for a rear drag reel."
434028,0,"I purchased this item as ""open box"" and in fact the box was in very shabby condition. The binoculars seemed ""like new"" as promised, and I have found them to be essentially of good quality. The only issue I have with them is that there is no indication either on the binoculars, or on the packaging to suggest that they are made by Nikon. The pair I got was from a third party vendor and they were considerably less expensive than any of the others, but I assumed that to be a result of their open box status, not because they were a Chinese copy of the Nikon product. That said, I'm happy with them. They were a bargain at the price I paid, which was under $25."

The stitching in the zipper and the button by it were all connected and I had to fight to open them the 1st time, leaving strings hanging all over the place that had to be trimmed. The zipper is much shorter than the one in the 1st pair, making less flex in the fit. I still like them, but wish they were more like the 1st pair."

397780,0,I purchased this product 10 years ago and was very pleased with it. I reordered this product with the same label that was on the product ten years ago. I was very descriptive when ordering because I wanted to be sure and get what I already had. The label was the same but the bottle and contents were not. I told them the liquid was blue....what I received was a white creme. The new cleaner is no better than anything I could pick up off of the shelf at any store.I was very disappointed in this product but I do understand that it has been ten years and they probably changed their product.......but not to the good. I should have been told that the product was no longer blue in color and that would have told me not to order it. This is the first time I have not been pleased with an order.........very pleased with past orders. Thank You
248179,0,"When these breeches arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the fit was pretty good. I'm only 4'11"" and the 28's weren't too long and didn't bag too much in the knees (common when you're shorter with breeches!). However, after riding in them a bit, I wish they had a bit more give in the fabric to conform to my body. Once on my horse, I had to really pull on them to adjust the legs upward for a comfortable ride. I just didn't get enough give in the crotch to make them comfy enough, though I think they fit well when standing! Perhaps I just need to break these in more, but I'll have to wait for the cool weather as the synthetic full seat is also a bit sweat inducing. Granted I rode in an indoor arena, when it was probably over 85, but I don't have as much of a pooling sweat issue in my seat when I wear a cotton breech. I think with a bit more riding time in these and cooler weather, they'll be good though. They seem extremely well made so could stand up to some washing for a more worn feel. Then, these will probably be among my favorites for cool weather riding!"
279375,1,I brought this bed for my guests to stay with me once in a while. it's very easy to pump up and deflate. the built-in pump was able to deflate the bed completely and make it very easy to fold and store. It's perfect for what I intend to use.
105844,2,Their small box is fine but this box is so ugly. It looks like somebody threw dirt in the plastic resin. I am not sure what they were going for a camo effect but whatever it did not work. It is has a little hinged compartment on top that is so small I could not visualize using it for anything. Really cuts down on the size of the box. Box hinges look flimsy. I usually like Plano products but this one is a rip off. Looks nothing like the photo. I have nothing good to say about this box. Worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon.
376148,0,"This was an average bike rack but it was suprisingly stable and didn't take up too much space in our small condo.Two main problems that we had with the stand were: 1. The first one that we received was missing some of the parts for putting it together. We exchanged it for a new one which was very easy to put together. 2. After a few weeks of use, the rubber on the bike holders started peeling off of two of the holders, leaving minor scratches on the bikes."
21330,1,This holster is well worth the money and is like haveng 2 for the price of 1. I have looked at these before for much more money. You don't have to worry about your firearm coming loose from the holster no matter what terrain or environment you may be in. Firearm can't be jerked from the holster by someone else without the locking mechanism being pushed. My Taurus Judge fits perfectly in it and stays locked in until I push the release button to remove it.

I have to base dinner time around whenever they want to workout so that it isn't close to when they want to do Insanity. I have bought my son a lot of gifts and this is the first one that I truly believe he has gotten a lot of use out of.
122168,0,"I bought one of these and they are a lot of fun. I broke one of the yellow springs though, make sure you have them locked perfectly in place or they will break when you jump if they are only partially in place. Otherwise I thought this was a very fun toy."
175291,0,"This is a good product for its price. Perfect conversion paddle for a player moving from pips out to pips in rubber. The paddle is kinda heavy, its rubber isnt very tacky, and the handle is solid. This is not for the pros, or ever intermediate players. I actually have three of these paddles and I use them to train my friends who are new to pingpong. Getting down the basics of spin, serves, and slams with rubber is made easier by this soft non-sticky rubber. Although most people will tell beginners to buy and expensive paddle and train to its level i disagree. Spinny rubber is fun to play with, but it also is hard to control opposition's spin when you are new to the game. This is the perfect conversion, and it gets a plus from me. If you are new to rubber, this is the paddle for you!"
149868,1,This is not the first time I've used Sea Foam. It is an amazing product. My car tells me the MPG I get and everytime I use this it restores my MPG by about 1 mile per gallon. On top of that I get a little bit of a cleaner pick up. I gave one to a friend who was complaining about loss in gas mileage. He said he didn't notice a change I'm that (yet) but he said his pick up in noticeably better. I also have a mechanic friend who swears by this stuff. I think it's worth the $10. It's the only product that has noticeable improvements in my car. Give it a try.
359948,2,"I admit, I was uneducated and unaware how to use a speed bag prior to buying this setup. The mounting bracket is fine, though it cannot be adjusted. However, the plastic swivel that came with the kit was near useless, as the bag was very slow to react. After spending $20 on a metal swivel, the performance greatly increased. However, it did not equate to the quality and response of the bag at my local gym, so I replaced the bag with a higher grade bag. Now it functions just fine, after dropping $60 in replacement parts. All-in-all, this is definitely a beginner bag, but you outgrow it within a week. Be wise and spend the extra money in the beginning and get a real kit. After all, I was reminded that you get what you pay for."
284976,0,"Has a lot of cleaning tools in this kit but with little to no instructions on what's what. All I wanted was a cleaning kit for my handgun and this would do the trick. But if you've never cleaned a gun before, it doesn't give any help on what to use. That's where Youtube comes in handy... The case is kind of poorly constructed (feels cheap) and the tools don't stay very well in their slots. I don't know if I'd purchase again."
113975,1,"I ADORE this chair. Easy to carry over my shoulder and stable when I sit on it on various surfaces (I pay attention to slowly sitting on it to be sure it will be stable). It is the answer I have been looking for, something to easily transport and use instead of standing for a long time. I used it when I was observing a series of dog training classes. I take it with me on group birdwatching trips so I have something to sit on if we are remaining in place for awhile. Sure spares me from getting backaches from standing too long!"

373431,0,"I loved this ball, until it burst. I loved its large diameter, its smart orange skin, the way it filled so quickly with air. But five months after I first pumped life into the ball, in the middle of a workout, I heard a slow, sad whisper from above my ear. One of the ribs had snagged and torn on my clean-clipped fingernail! I considered purchasing another, but after some thought, my next ball should probably be one with thicker skin."

176546,2,"The blades on this knife would not close without being manually pushed back into the body. None of the typical snap back like you typically find in slip joint knives. The plastic scales had a rivot that stuck out enough to catch your finger. Even though the knife is a US made knife the quality is way below that of the same model produce in the 1980s and 1990s. I have many knives and this rates as probably the poorest quality control I have seen in a knife allowed to leave the factory. I will continue purchasing knives through Amazon, but you can bet it will not be a Buck 300 series. Even the 500 series knives have gone down in quality. Additionally, I have sent Buck Knives two emails for other issues in the last few months and find that they do not respond."

503502,0,"Like so many of the reviewers, I have ultra sensitive skin and eczema. Latex gloves were an exercise in torture. I was never able to find anything that protected my hands yet didn't irritate them. Now I have! Based on the reviews I bought two pairs; one for dishes and another color for general cleaning. They keep my hands dry and in no way set off the itching that latex does. I was hesitant because they were a little pricey, but I find they are worth the price. It's great to finally have a solution.EDIT: After a little over a month of using the gloves, I was washing dishes one day and noticed dark spots on the gloves. This surprised me as a wash the exterior, regularly. I pulled them off for a closer look and discovered dark mildew spots INSIDE the gloves. I was surprised because I had been very careful not to allow water to splash inside the cuffs of the gloves. This is hard to do, because the gloves really aren't that long and when doing dishes, it's pretty hard not to let a few drops slip in, no matter how hard you try.I decided to put them in the washing machine, inside out, and see if cleaning them that way would clean out the mildew. It didn't. Out they went in the trash.I hope that this is something that can be easily fixed because I loved these gloves for protecting my sensitive skin, until this happened. I'm going to give them a second try and wash them in the machine regularly (hopefully before mildew can even develop) and see if that helps.Edit: After my bad experience I did purchase more gloves and this time made a point to wash them regularly. This has helped and this pair has lasted much longer."

140730,1,"I have been using this for a few weeks now about twice a week, I run 3 days a week and do a good yoga stretch one but I was getting really bored with the Wii fit exercises as you just click on one, do it, and then pick another one. Boring and no flow at all!! Anyway I do the medium intensity 30 day challenge which is just enough to get a decent workout without working TOO hard. I will probably bump it up in a couple weeks when I cut my running back a bit after the 10K. I like the flow of this one and the fact that each workout is just a bit different and once you have done many of the exercises, you can start skipping the video's and still be able to follow along. The on-screen directions are really good, the first time I used it I was an idiot, and even though the picture shows which direction to put the nunchuck in the strap, I still put it in backwards and when I did the first squat it said I was not getting low enough. It took me about a minute to figure out the problem and then we were off and running! And yeah, there are a few exercises where I can see a cordless remote/nunchuck would be good but it is definitely do-able with the regular ones. Also, yes, the band included offers little resistance, but those are super cheap to replace with a tougher one! No it doesn't use the board all that much but that's only because the game is designed to work even if you don't have one. Like others, my only complaint is no ab work but for a general cardio workout, this does the trick and is pretty fun! It's things like the inline skating that make leg strengthening and endurance a bit more fun! The Wii fit's cardio is deplorable, either your run in place forever (which is only a small part of Active) or pretend to use a hula hoop or you do a painfully slow ""step routine""! If you are just looking for a good overall cardio workout with some good strengthening exercises you will do well with this game."
186322,0,"The trainer is as advertised, and works great. Good unit for the money. Simple to set-up and use. I would certainly recommend getting a road-type tire for the rear of your bike if you are using with a mountain bike, as the vibration of the tire can get loud and be irritating after a while. But, I'm sure that's the case with any trainer.The problem... ...AMAZON. When I clicked ""THIS IS A GIFT"", I assumed it would arrive in some sort of nondescript packaging. No, it arrived in it's box, proudly displayed on my porch where, upon arriving home from work, my wife gat an early birthday present. HELLO? AMAZON? Anyone home?

141329,1,"The Hogue Jr. Pistol Sleeve appears to be a custom fit for my Phoenix Arms HP22. The sleeve was a little tight to put on, but that was to be expected from the directions that came with it. Once on though, the raised finger swell makes the pistol much more comfortable to hold in your hand. That combined with the extended finger swell on the bottom of the magazine makes for a very comfortable grip for a small gun vs large hand. The pistol went from a Saturday Night Special without the sleeve to a serious looking custom pistol with the sleeve."

It is nice to pack into hills but if you need to clean it you would be better of cutting off a stick from a tree and making your own rod with then trying to use the cable and patches that come in this kit."

250173,0,"The backboard and rim are good enough, although a bit less stable than I had hoped. The problem and disappointment for me was the installation of the pole into the sleeve in the concrete. You are supposed to insert the pole in a plastic sleeve in the cement, let it set, then remove the pole, fill the pole with cement, let it set, and re-insert the pole ito the sleeve. Unfortunately, the sleeve contracted requiring me to chip away some of the concrete, and then I had to climb a ladder and pound the pole (doused in a lubricant) with a sledge hammer into the sleeve in order to insert it. I bought this system as I was under the impression that I'd be able to remove the pole if I decided I wanted to move it. Not going to happen now. The pole will never be removed unless I break out all of the concrete. If you want to have the option of possibly moving the system, this product isn't for you."

358182,0,"A good knife, however do note that this item is misrepresented.Here, the RAT-3 is listed as the D2 steel version. I ordered from this seller (4 star Military Surplus) and received the 1095 steel version. Apart from the blade steel difference, the D2 version has black linen micarta handle slabs as pictured - the 1095 has green canvas micarta instead.I'm not going to go through the hassle of returning it, but do note that the 1095 version costs around 10-20$ less than what's listed here compared to other sellers' listings.I don't have anything against 1095 - it sharpens more easily and the 1095 version has the grippier canvas micarta handle slabs. However I was specifically looking to get a knife in D2 for the stronger edge retention and improved corrosion resistance.Otherwise the Randall's Adventure and Training design is ergonomic and tough - unlike other tacticool blades out there. You're getting a good knife, whether it's made by RAT or Ontario, though there have been some legal hassles between the two lately."

They were loose, and unlike other customers, I found the finger holes to be quite big. I double checked the pacakaging and tags inside the gloves. They both claim M. I hate the hassle of returning items, so for $10....I will probably just give them away. Still a waste.

They have worn very well for me over a number of years. (This is proabably my third pair over maybe 6-9 years, so they ""wear well,"" are very sturdy and durable. Only reason I replaced my last pair was that I somehow lost them -- probably because I didn't make sure the velcro fasteners on the strap were completely stuck together, & my old pair dropped off the outside of my gym bag, where I keep them in between workouts so they'll air out and dry completely. Being more careful and making sure the velcro strips are solidly connected has kept them in place on the outside of my gym bag with no problems at all for at least a month.) (Could it be that someone stole my old pair? Never thought of that possibility.) Have always been completely satisfied with this brand and model."

93031,0,"First off, let me start by saying as a heart monitor, I am very happy with that feature of this unit. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because I don't feel it does everything that the polar web site leads you to believe!Issues I have with this product:1. I have had problems getting it to download workouts to the website(yes, to the website, this unit does not allow you to download to your computer, only to their website) several times so far, you have to have the wrist unit aligned almost perfectly with the microphone on your computer for it to work.2. You can't create personal workout plans and download them from the computer to the wrist unit. Per Polar's own website ""UpLink, settings upload from Polar web site or software to wrist unit"" It only updates the wrist unit time, the user info(i.e. weight, age, etc), and you can create a personal logo to go on the watch screen of the wrist unit. There is no option to upload anything from the Polar web site to the unit itself.Positives about this unit:1. The heart rate monitor seems to be very accurate.2. The fitness test with OwnIndex is a useful tool and easy to use.3. Ability to send the workout info from the wrist unit to the web site is a very useful tool(a bit difficult to get to work)4. The chest strap that comes with it is the most comfortable of the many I have worn in the past!Over all, I think this is a pretty good HRM if used for just that. I would suggest buying a less expensive one like the F4 which is a little more than half the price, or even the FS1 which is well under half the price of this one.For my workouts, I have had to carry my GPS unit to track the distance I am running/biking in order to add it to the uplinked info on the website to help track my workouts better.If your looking for a basic HRM this is it, but Polar offers many others at lower prices. If you want a HRM with a lot of bells and whistles and it customizable this is not the unit for you."

I see it advertised for use during exercising but I would not recommend it for that. you need to wear it and use one hand on it for several seconds which is not how I would have available during a workout. I use a watch with a chest monitor during workouts.This watch works great for quick check. Nice and light.

114143,0,I have had this product for 1 year now. It is okay but and I haven't had any problems as the others that have bought this item. The bands have lasted thru all the exercises that I have done and I exercise with the machine 3 days out of the week and spend my other 3 days doing cardio. I am going to buy the Neo Shaper because I don't have to fool with the bands and break my nails. So anyone considering buying this I would more than likely recommend to invest your money in the neo shaper.

107236,0,"What can I say, there are your basic sweat pants. If that is what you are looking for, this is it. I just wanted the basic ones with elastic waist and legs and with pockets. The material is a little thin, but if not abused they hold up well and are very comfortable."
229925,0,Great jump rope easy to use and counts your jumps which is great. The only bad thing about this product is that the rope itself must be either lay down or hung somewhere when you are done. Donot fold or twirl the rope because then the rope is bent and your jumps are no good. Otherwise then that great product.
473088,1,"I used to see these in the gym all the time and never take them seriously, but needed something that I could take on the road when I travel. Took the chance and I'm glad I did. These provide a good, portable workout that is easy to take with you and weighs almost nothing, so you won't have any problems staying within that weight limit on airlines.This is not as good as a gym workout in my opinion, but for $10, it's worth getting, especially if you travel and can't always make it to the gym."
358310,1,As usual Russell puts out a great shirt. It looses a star because the XL size was a bit big on me-ever other XL shirt fits fine!
351434,0,"I was all excited when I recieved the light set, I needed one badly riding to work day/night and all weather. First the headlight, put the batteries in, wow, bright,hurts the eyes, it will do the job on my unlit streets. Tail light, read problems putting in batteries, with a small screw driver I had them in, in less then 2 minutes. Now the problem, it didn't work, after all the hype about how bright, kaput, I went out and bought new batteries and nothing, never got to see this fireball shine or blink. I gave 3 stars to half the package (headlight) If the tail lite worked like people say then 5. Sent it all back, getting Planet Bike Super Flasher and another headlite."
236516,1,I got this to support my mountain bike after I have installed a babyseat. The product came without any instructions but it wasn't difficult to figure out how to install it. One thing I have complain is that the back plate chipped and a piece broke off because I tightened the top screw too much. Even with this issue I am happy with it because it supports the bike perfectly when I am putting my son in the seat.
485769,0,There's only room for one foot on the foot plate and there are no brakes. Again the spiderman plate on the front is way too big and you cannot hold onto the hand grips. You need tools to raise and lower the handle bars (instead of that neat little flip thing on other scooters). It's sturdy and my son loves it. He doesn't care about the flaws and defects. Buyer beware.
227163,2,"According to the product's label it:- Kills wasps, hornets and yellow jackets and eliminates the nests where they live and breed.- Kills dangerous pests on contact.- 27-foot jet spray lets you keep a safe distance while you eliminate wasps and hornets in their hard-to-reach nests.I've used this product on the same wasp nest for a week every other day only to watch the nest and its population grow and thrive. The nest probably doubled in size. Using it to try to take down a single airborne wasp wasn't much better than a squirt bottle of water. Most other brands foam up and prevent the wasps from flying. The Spectracide side product remains a liquid and many wasps easily flew 25 feet or more to a nearby tree.I feel lucky I wasn't stung. Use at your own peril."
495443,1,I read all of the reviews and made my selection. The watch did come in a non Seiko box. The quality is unsurpassed and keeping great time. I did not notice the set stem ever coming out on its own. The adjustment of the link was very easy. The watch band is solid. Over all very pleased happy with the purchase.
391442,0,This HRM is pretty easy to set up and use and the watch and band are comfortable. As far as I can tell the heart rates are accurate but it doesn't ask if you are male or female and the calorie burn is WAY higher than it should be - the default must be for male. It's annoying but you can take the HRM values and plug them in to a calorie burn equation that asks for M/F to get a more accurate number.
76599,1,"I have owned this jacket for four years and have lots of good things to say about it:1. This jacket is both incredibly light and packs into a very small bundle--convenient for backpacks or suitcases.2. This is the least bulky rain jacket I have ever seen, and also one of the most breathable and windproof because of the kind of Goretex used. And of course it is 100% waterproof--I have stayed dry in some severe downpours.3. This also makes a great winter shell. I am a serious runner (1200 miles a year) and run outdoors in all kinds of weather. I have used this jacket when running in sleet/freezing rain storms as well as regular snow storms with winds gusting 25 MPH, and I have stayed nice and warm with only a thin running jacket and base layer underneath this jacket. The hood also has a nice visor that helps shield your face from the elements.4. I also like the side vents, which are handy for use on warm humid days when it rains, and also for venting when I run on a nice sunny winter day and use this as a shell.This jacket is not inexpensive, but it is well worth the money. It is well constructed and has held up nicely during my years of using it."
483869,1,"This is an AWESOME water filter! It is so easy to use and clean. It is more than handy when hiking, going on long bike trips and camping. I mean, there is only so much water that you can carry. At first, my husband and I thought this filter was too expensive, and tried to do without. Let me tell you, when we were in the middle of nowhere with little water left, and a creek nearby, we regretted sooo much not having purchased this filter earlier. As soon as we got back, we ordered one, and we absolutely love it. It is well worth every penny. It is so well made, and delivers everything it promises. Now, we never bike/hike/camp without it."
247771,0,"Nice, but far thinner material than an older identical style number. I was hoping for the heavier version but these will do for light duty. Minimal shrinkage in sleeves as well as overall length and width, but they WILL shrink."
222462,2,"These hurt the skin web between my middle and ring fingers. I guess I will have to cut it or something, but it's way better without them :(I bought them to avoid pain, but the pain is even harderOne year after, they are almost destroyed. I washed them like 3-4 times and now there is a big hole in it."
484979,0,"I purchsed this 60W setup to aquaint myself with solar and really learned a lot. I already had a little 6"" fan driven directly off a 20W panel (CDT-F20) to cool my bedroom but it speeds up and slows down with the sun and can't run at night. I also bought a 6W ceiling var-fan for the other room. The solution is to run them off battery that is kept charged with this system. I live in a condo and put two panels outside a south facing window and two outside a west facing window (Hawaii). The sunprint is about 5.3 hours here but I gave myself 2-3 hours due my less than ideal panel placement. That gives me 5 amps x 2.5 hours or 12.5 amp hours per day. My ceiling fan draws .5 amps so It draws about 12 amp-hours per day so will not exceed what the sun is giving me. I should have bought a 25-30 amp-hour battery but ended up getting an 18 amp-hour battery. The system is working fine so far. The sun is keeping the battery topped off and I can run my fans at a continuous speed at night when needed. Keep in ming this is a very low output system 60W so it only makes sense for hobbyists or running low power stuff like cell phone or laptop charging, but it works and it's cool."
407103,0,"Yes, these are comfortable pants. The elastic waist does add to the comfort by stretching when you're active. The cotton canvas material breathes well for summer wear and also insulates pretty good for colder weather. The pants are cut roomy, have double material in the seat and knees. The rear pockets are large and the number of patch pockets allow you to carry a lot of stuff. But these pants share the one major downside of the Royal Robbins Billy Goat pants from which they are derived. They shrink. Mostly in the length but also some in the waist as well. And they continue to shrink over time. They seem to come a little oversized when new to help make up for this shrinkage but the sizing is not really consistent which leads to differences in fit over time. I have some 5.11 pants that still fit me well in both the waist and inseam, some that are now ""high water"" pants that look goofy since they hit me above my ankles and some that are now too tight in the waist. All of them started out the same size. Since cotton does stretch with wear, those that are only a little tight in the waist are still wearable but not as comfortable as they started out even considering the elastic waist band. I was originally very impressed with 5.11 pants, so much so that I bought several pair in various colors. Now I have an assortment of pants in various stages of fit. Take it from someone with experience, wash these things in cold water and dry them without any heat. Even taking these precautions, I still had shrinkage problems.As an alternative to the 5.11 tac pants, I've found Tru-Spec 24/7 in ripstop poly/cotton to be an excellent choice. The Tru-Spec pants are comfortable year-round despite being mostly polyester, they handle hard use extremely well, they have roomier (and more) pockets with some of the strongest Velcro ever made and they don't shrink even a fraction of an inch despite many washes. The only downside to the poly/cotton Tru-Specs would be for those who might be in proximity to open flames and burning embers due to the polyester content--be careful around a crackling campfire."
104922,1,"Nice pants, generously sized - I often take a 36 waist, and the days of 34 are in the past... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two: a pencil/screwdriver shaft section plus the rest, which isn't quite big enough for a smartphone. Get a seam unpicker though, and you can turn it into one larger pocket that's ideal for a phone, complete with light velcro fastener at the top.All pants should have a phone pocket these days, preferably a subtle one."
348922,0,I used this to cut foam insulation. I cut several pieces of 2&#34; foam insulation with this and by the end of the first day it was tearing the foil. It also is dangerous to put your finger on it to add pressure near the blade. If you order this order cut resistant gloves too.
250549,2,"This is a reasonable light that certainly does a good job of making you visible to motorists. I would agree with the reviewer about brightness - it is not really bright enough to use as the only source of illumination.For me the most disappointing factor is the 'no tools' fitting strap. It grips poorly on glossy surfaces - like many handlebars, for example! I ended up gluing rubber patches to the inside of the strap to improve this.Worse, the strap tensioner actually broke apart after just over a year of use. The pivot pins are just not up to the rest of the build quality.Pros- Good light for sodium lit city streets- Really waterproof- Solid caseCons- The 'no tools' strap simply sucks.- You'll need another light if it is genuinely dark where you ride.Not really worth the investment. I bought a cheaper 5-led light - with a proper screwdriver tightened quick release fixing - that I am far happier with.The CatEye is now an expensive spare flashlight."
301512,1,I purchased this compass because I like the way Brunton uses the circle in a circle method to align the compass and because it has built in scales for UTM grids. This is a good compass to use if you are using paper maps with a GPS. The scales work on 1:24k Topo maps available from the USGS as well as military 1:50k maps. The built in ruler is reversible for English or metric measurement. It also is adjustable for declination. A separate ruler/scale is included to allow you to determine Lat/Long on maps as well. This is a good general purpose compass for someone who wants to be able to work with Topo maps and a GPS.
64642,1,"Purchased this scooter for my Granddaughters 5th birthday. She loved it. No assembly required, we just took it out of the box and adjusted handlebar height, very easy, and she was ready to go. The Hello Kitty emblems and little change purse were an added bonus. I shopped around for prices and this was a great price and arrived before expected delivery date.I will definately buy another Razor scooter for my other Grandchild when he is old enough."
508732,2,"First of all the box arrived so banged up, pieces of the rack were hanging out - it looked like it got left in the rain along the way. Second, there is no possible way we can figure out to rack 6 bikes on this thing. The product description said single-sided - that is impossible - the spaces are WAY too close together. We also tried it double-sided (which wouldn't work in the space we have to rack bikes anyway) but that didn't work either. And mountain bike tires don't even fit into the rack"
504946,1,Truly great running pants. I have already used them to go running and they are very comfy. I highly recommend them.
196049,0,01/23/2013: I received my product very fast but after installing the batteries the product was useless. I even tried a new batteries set and yet didn't work. I am not going to give up and going to get a replacement and see what happens.01/26/2013: Received the second one and after installing the new batteries it worked as expected. so far no complaint but I haven't used it in the field. will update later
260160,1,"I just purchased my second Jade yoga mat. My old navy blue one was a trooper for almost daily practice, only now beginning to show severe wear after four years. I have retired it to home use only. I bought the lighter cobalt blue mat and it's goegeous, like the color of the sky just before a thunder storm. I love the feeling of a new mat, like the cushion of a brand new pair of running shoes or an ironed pillow case. I appreciate how stable I feel on the jade, as compared to Gaiam or other ""sticky"" mats. This one has hold, so even in complicated poses where good grip is essential, I feel secure. Beware, even the Jade cannot stand up to hot yoga classes. The only time I went to a hot yoga class I was sweating so that I slipped and fell much like one would on a slip and slide. This is a one time thing, though, and in a normal class I feel extremely secure. These mats have a good long life, and in fact once they really get broken in they are even better."

454326,0,"Okay, so you decide to spend the day at the beach and you find you need some new flip-flops. You head to the drugstore on the way and there you find two racks of flops -- one has Hong Kong-made for 99 cents a pair and the other has Swiss-made flops for $30.00 a pair. The Swiss ones have a glow-in-the-dark toe strap, but otherwise there is no visible difference between the two types of flip-flops. But, well, everybody knows Swiss stuff is just naturally better made and that justifies the higher cost, right?After several months of owning the Luminox Navy Seals yellow dial(3005) watch, $157, I kinda feel like the guy who bought the $30 flip-flops to get the Swiss label and the glowing toe strap. I'm not sure that, for my purposes, a $45 Timex with Indiglo night lite wouldn't do the job just as well. I would certainly put the Luminox up against my Invicta Swiss quartz diver with steel case and bracelet, screw-on stainless steel case back screw-down crown, good night-time lume, 200 meter water resistance and Submariner-style dial($88 on sale at Amazon two years ago).Don't get me wrong. The Luminox seems to be everything it claims to be (I haven't been down 200 meters but it does fine in the shower. The crown does not screw down and the plastic caseback is held on by four small machine screws. Again, cheap-looking construction). So this is a military-looking plastic Swiss quartz watch with atomic glowing hands and markers, a decent rubber strap (the strap on mine is not quite wide enough to fill the entire space between the lugs on the watch head, which seems cheap).I have no way of knowing if this Luminox will long outlast the Timex and the Invicta. But I'm feeling like that guy who bought the $30 Swiss flip-flops and had buyer's remorse later, afraid he fell for a big load of hype."
360570,2,Caution! This chinning bar requires you to open 6 holes on the door frame for the 6 screws. Hence it is not portable by any means. Also it expands up to a point that is still not fixed hard against the frame; after this point the bar rotates without expanding! Big dissapointment from Everlast.

499363,0,"My two year old daughter and I used the ""Ultimate Trike"" for a week until one of the steering cables broke. (I could turn only to the right). Big disappointment to spend $80 in a tricycle from Radio Flyer that last one week.I visited the RadioFlyer customer service web site (http://www.radioflyer.com/support/customer_service.html) and filled out a ""part replacement"" form. The next day a Customer Service Representative (Anshu Aul) contacted me and informed me that she will send me a replacement cable for free. She also explained that RadioFlyer made an improvement on the cable to make it more robust.In summary:Great product (when it work), but shame on RadioFlyer to introduce a fragile product to the market that doesn't represent the brand image (Good, robust, quality products almost indestructible). I hope that the improvement on the cable save the reputation and the performance of this tricycle."

371875,0,"I bought these as a gift for someone in late June 2010. Upon receipt, I noticed the plastic around the discs was taped with clear packing tape - almost like someone had previously opened the package... The weirdest thing was that if you looked REALLY close at the seal, the image on the back was not messed up at all, like you would expect if the item had been opened. Either way, I felt pretty tacky giving that as a gift but unfortunately didn't have time to exchange them. I explained to the recipient that I thought I was buying something new, and apologized for the tape. Luckily for me, they didn't care & immediately ripped the package open, but just a warning to someone who is giving this as a gift and would be bothered by giving something that looks like it's already been opened... The discs that were sent to me looked new other than that tape.Also, the colors did not match those in the picture. We were sent a white, yellow and dark blue. This really wasn't a big deal to me (I was so stuck on the tape issue!!), but wanted to mention this in case you have your heart set on the colors in the picture.I do not know much about disk golf, so I can't say how these compare in quality to other disks... I don't think the person I gave these to has tried them yet, but they do seem very excited about them, so that's always a good thing!"
113138,2,"As a prospective buyer of this product can observe by just skimming the reviews on Amazon.com, there are a lot of bicycles this seat cover just doesn't fit. Mine (a Confidence Foldable Stow Away Exercise Bike - I really like it!) is no exception.So be careful to check the seat measurements before you order, and don't just take the manufacturer's or seller's word for it that it's going to be okay. It seems to me that a lot of people are being ripped off. Not fair!By the way, if you are one of the lucky ones and the seat does fit your bicyle, it does seem very nice. Sturdy, and lots of gel in it.If only!"
140691,1,"I just got this yesterday, as soon as it came out. So today I used it for my morning work out. By the end of my 30 minute session, I was drenched in sweat and feeling good! This is definitely WAAAY better than Wii Fit. In Wii Fit, you just do individual exercises. Nothing really got my heart rate up. Well, Active is like an interactive exercise video....except they have cooler things like inline skating. Loved the inline skating portion of my work out today! I definitely recommend Wii Active."
275636,0,"It was not a one piece upper body and lower body suit. It had seams which ripped on me after my first use. They replaced it with a new one. You need to be VERY careful putting on and off and I would recommend putting on a nylon shirt underneath it to aid in putting on and taking off. Of course, by doing such, you will sweat a whole lot more, but that is the purpose of the product. For a product named Everlast, it should be much more durable. I have been using it for my last two or three bike routines without issue. Be careful when using. It does its job."

303398,0,"Ordered the special P90X package that includes the bands and pull-up bar with HIGH HOPES and ready to get started! The dvd's are instructional as promised, but Tony Horton is so obnoxious. He tells you (the average person) how to do the exercise and then says, ""I'm going to get some quick reps in..."" and does a ton of push-ups really fast and perfectly while you ache your way through your first set. Yes, Tony, we know you're in excellent condition, we are not and that's why we've purchased your product. No need to rub it in while we are trying to push through the first day's lesson. My other problem is that if you order the recommended pull-up bar and are just starting out, they suggest using the bands. Okay, I also ordered the bands. However, the guys in the video are using their regular bars in a nice gym and they stretch the bands to the floor. Well, I can't mount mine on the ceiling at my house. It can only go in a doorway and the bands won't reach the same distance (as the video shows). I am going to return this set, because honestly, Tony is really just showing how to do push-ups and pull-ups. I can do those at the gym and I won't be annoyed with Tony. They do require a code for returns and you must have your original transaction number (which is not included with your shipment), so if you do buy, hang onto that online receipt. The customer service people tell you that you can't have the money back guarantee without it. If you're in close to excellent condition, this video set will help you to get really ripped. If you're a regular person, you may end up feeling like a lard-a$$ and lose your motivation in just getting started."

But with these it's just a matter of time before my feet are freezing because I'm rotting in cold, wet socks.And, they. are. hard. I know you need to break boots in an all, but they're hard as heck. Tight. I'm talking tight on my instep. Feels like a vice-grip on the top of my foot. They're easing up, but I don't know if they'll ever be truly comfortable. And maybe I'm the wrong person to review these, because I don't ride, or muck out stalls, or whatever. I live in the city. But I wanted a pair of boots that were as comfy as the boots I wore in High School. Not so much.If you're a half-size, get the half size. Don't size down. I can barely get my hoof into these as it is.If I had the money to spend again, would I buy these boots? Probably not.But they're well put together.

So the calorie count ismeaningless - the monitor doesn't even know the flywheel resistance levelyou're using.

If you standup from the seat and row, the monitor stays blank. If you leave the rowingbar alone and just push the seat back-n-forth with your hand, the monitorshows plenty of activity!The machine has three supports, but the middle support is actually slightlyoff the ground.

135557,0,These videos are amazing they really do work you out and they are serious about you having to be dedicated. Its tough!!! The only think I dont understand is why they made these videos where you cant play them in a DVD player. I have tryed on several DVD players and it has something to do with the playback. The first few that I have tried worked on my PS3 I am hoping the rest will as well. I know they work on a computer. But why would they want you to work out from a computer. Other than that the workouts are great if they would fix that it would make these videos that much better.

Maybe I should have known better than to think I could just go from zero exercise to a program like this. Let me just say, if you are not in shape this program is going to be hard. I have made it through 4 weeks of doing the DVD workouts. I had to practice the 'basic exercises' on the cards 2 weeks before starting that to get up the strength to keep up with the videos. I still can't get through the 'Bum Bum' video without stopping to catch my breath. But let me say this:IT IS HARD BUT IT WORKS.My butt has never been perkier and my cellulite dimples are starting to diminish. Even my legs and abs are toned and sexy.

The padded bag survived the trip quite well, and storage is more than adequate. The only flaw I encountered was some loosening of the rod sections after several casts.

472447,0,"My first diver timepiece. Would have given it 5 stars, except for the fact that the spring-bar in the clasp came broken.UPDATE: July 16, 2012I've now had this watch for about 3 and a half months now and worn it practically every day. Some added observations:1. Like some other Invicta reviews I've read, the movement on this watch sounds like it's a bit loose -- there's a jangly sound inside the case if I gently shake the watch when it's off my wrist. Not a huge issue, but doesn't exactly speak of a reputable build quality.2. The dial window has been fairly scratch resistant, despite being mineral crystal. That said, the finish is starting to wear off the cyclops, so it looks as though there's a bubble trapped beneath, making the date a little difficult to read.3. The movement doesn't keep accurate time. It consistently adds a minute or two every 4-6 days.4. The power reserve is weak, lasts no more than 24 hours or so.5. Invicta's service/support is slow. My piece came with a broken spring-bar in the clasp and was basically unwearable until I changed out the band. When I called to complain and ask for replacement spring-bars, the support staffer said it would take up to 90 days to fulfill my order and receive my replacement. Sure enough, about 95 days after I made that call, I received my spring-bars.Overall, because of these issues, I've dropped my rating to 3 stars. If I had done a bit more research beforehand, I probably wouldn't have ordered this watch.If your budget allows (or can save up a few hundred dollars more), the German watch manufacturer UHR makes an automatic diver with a Swiss (ETA) movement. From the reviews I've read, it's a great watch (with a great movement) for only around $300-$350. Might have to be my next watch."
92834,1,"I had hoped to purchase this scope for a trip to Yellowstone but just couldn't justify the cost. When it came on sale I gave in..... and SO glad I did! Took it on vacation to the Sierras first thing. We stay at 9600 feet plus elevation.... we could watch the pica and squirrels at the top of the ridge and identify flowers blooming on the rock face. Amazing... and very easy to use. Color quality remained high. A little trouble finding target but that just takes practice. We also watched a mother bear and three cubs from about 800 feet away, we could see their whiskers!"

100327,0,"Bought these handwraps about a month ago from a local store. First class they felt great as a beginner boxer, great padding while using full 16oz training gloves. The fact that it takes seconds to put them on and take them off makes it great for someone who doesn't know how to do wraps themselves. After a couple of weeks, the padding is still good but the wrist and hand stability are lacking as I've starting hitting harder. A couple of good hard sessions on the bags and my hands feel swollen and have some soreness. I don't know if this is due to my hitting style or if its due to the lack of stability in these speed wraps. After using the mexican style elastic wraps, I would not come back to these, the stability of the traditional wrap is far superior to these. The neoprene construction tore during a training session with plyometric conditioning. Bottom line: If you are a beginner, these are a good bet as they provide good padding for the break-in weeks of hitting a bag, but long term look into a 180"" length handwrap for the durability and stability provided with a traditional wrap."
370635,1,Great field knife! Used in Afghan and held up like a ka bar should! Good handle and feel to it. Comes with Kytex sheath which locks in the knife without having to tie or strap the handle in.

In order to use half the tools you have to hold a very small and sharp blade and twist. I cut my self several times. I really need to throw it away, but that small flat blade screw driver is the only one that works in a pair of glasses I own. Oh and try to open a bottle, you have to pry with the sharp end of the blade! Stupid design."

154912,1,"This light is very decieving. By looking at it you think ""aahh it can't be that bright"", but you would be wrong. This light is extremely bright. With the numerous settings you have a light for every scenario. This light is that bright I was asked by a police officer if I could put it on a lower setting, I had it on the medium setting. If you ride mainly in cities you can see street signs easily at about 50 to 75 yards if not a little further. The only downfall is having a place to mount the battery. It is very ackward in size and shape, but if you try you will find a place to put it. Overall this light is the best for your buck"

I don't know how the rower would hold up for a really heavy person."

She loves them too."
4404,0,"Like any purchase, you should have some idea of what you are buying. You can't compare this knife to the best knives on the market. This is a no nonsense utility knife. It's cheap enough that you don't worry about the knicks and scrapes and drops that you know are going to happen. Use it everyday, for everything. When it gets dull beyond usefulness, replace it. If you just need a cheap blade that works without the name or frills, this one is perfect."

136344,0,"The workouts themselves are great. Anyone who complains about them being too tough just has to modify and slowly build up to doing what the on-screen crew is doing.The problem that I have has to do with the quality of the dvd's. I ordered two sets -- one to give as a gift. In both sets the routines ""Max interval sports training & Insane abs,"" and ""Insane abs,"" jump from one part of the routine to another every ten seconds or so. The on-screen timer jumps around with the sceen-changes, but the dvd timer clicks along in the normal fashion, so the dvd's were 'printed' this way. In one of the sets I received, all of the dvd's that are supposed to contain two routines do not have the second one.Beachbody publishes this and does not seem be a quality company. When I contacted them about the problem, they were uninterested because I had purchased from secondary sources. If you want to purchase this workout, do so knowing that you may be getting only part of what you are paying for."
242054,1,"I'm getting ready for Army Basic Training, so obviously I'm doing a ton of cardio to prepare. I was already in shape before buying this, but after I started using this I have noticed a considerable difference in my lung capacity and how hard I'm breathing. I go hike a TOUGH mountain trail near my house at least twice a week and I can definitely notice a difference in how much less effort I'm putting in to breathing, as well as my legs even burning - which I think is due to my body oxygenating so much better. Definitely recommend it if you play any type of sports, you're military/future military, or you just enjoy staying fit."
77670,1,"I have read some of the other reviews regarding the poor quality of the video picture as well as the boxing footage, and I would have to agree but only to an extent. Although the film footage is not grammy nomination material the boxing lessons however, are priceless. The lessons provided on this video are highly recommended and come from very sound sources. The trainers and the training presented on this program are highly professional, very practical, and can be implemented immediately. Although the training and lessons are very practical, it is fair to say that the lessons go into enough detail, and show very complicated and very elaborate boxing as well as mitt work to say that this could be an experts' video. I say this because some of the tecniques shown are very elaborate and require much boxing expertise and experience on both the part of the boxer and the trainer. If one can overlook the film quality, which in my opinion is not that big a deal, and appreciate this video for the trainers and training presented, then one will find this video very useful and very enlightening. The video is very long and shows many different trainers and their styles of mitt work. The Roger Mayweather segment is rare glimpse into a mitt work style unlike no other. The other trainers are great as well, and offer many effective boxing techniques of their own. This is a true boxers video, straight up, to the point, and without all the glitz and glammor of a commericially made video. This is a video for boxers, by boxers, so don't expect hollywood film making, but expect a really good video, with really good boxing and training."

This is where these 10X22X50 Nikon's SHINE and why I use these Nikon's.For the money, I'm impressed. If you understand value and how to use them, these Nikon's can't be beat and all this with the Nikon lifetime paperwork TOO, a true ""no-brain-r.All the same, I'd like to suggest, go look through a pair of hi-buck, big objective, long range, poor light situation binoculars to get an idea of what the big money will get, to have a future point of reference when you win the lottery.Is this Nikon glass up to that... not by a long shot but for 90% of what binoculars are for, these little marvels do a very good job without field striping you bank account and if they hit the floor, you won't be have to deal with an insurance claim."
449559,2,After reading all the reviews and stuff of this sweatshirt i thought it would be the greatest thing i will ever wear. But it wasn't as good as i expected it to be. Its super warm tho.

They are warm, so know that. They have a pretty thick/wide waist band, so if you aren't into that, there you go. Love these pants!"
123456,0,"In all honesty, the watch is probably more of a 3.5 than a 3. It's not a 4 (at least on my scale)simply because it doesn't keep very good time. It kind of reminds me of the old digital watches you could get from mailing in cereal box tops.The logo and band are very nice and you can show your team pride, maybe just fall back on using something else to give you an accurate time."

I have always used a Polar heart rate monitor to keep me in the zone.The Iphone fits quite nicely over the old telemetry and provides entertainment and a timer. Nice heavy stable bike works well.I could a purchase a Cat or Lifecycle, I have used them at the gym, they are nice.The Schwinn is fine. Find a used on one craigslist and save 500.00 dollars.Dan"

199580,0,"I was disappointed when I began installing this odometer because the wire is not long enough to reach to the rear wheel. It is designed only for use on the front wheel. This is a problem for me because I use my bike on a stationary trainer in the winter (where only the rear wheel turns). My second big complaint is that a part was missing (the underside bracket for mounting the digital unit to your handlebars). Lastly the plastic was cheap. As I was attaching the magnet to the wheel spoke, the plastic catch (that wraps around the spoke) snapped off....and I hadn't even fully tightened it yet."
355528,1,"I bought this for my husband who is in his forties and still hanging on to his Columbia jacket from his college days. Maybe he will finally let me retire it. The coat fits great and is a very nice quality. He is a size large but has long arms and the sleeves were nice and long. I bought the Bonsai color and was worried it would look a little too ""hip and snow-boarder-like"" but it is more of a muted fern green with navy detailing. For $56.00 this is a steal! Thanks, Amazon(now if you would just join Upromise)"

127736,0,"I was fortunate enough to get this for a wicked low price last winter and I saved it for ""Santa"" to give to my daughter for Christmas.First, the good: 1) the classic styling looks great; 2) the sled runs pretty well on packed powder, and even better on well-packed crust; and 3) the sled feels solid.Alas, the bad: 1) the steering rail (the only piece which requires assembly) is secured to the frame by three screws, but the pre-drilled were not properly aligned, requiring re-drilling; 2) the rope in the rail is a festive red, but it is comprised of cotton braid which started fraying immediately; and 3) the sled's weight makes it a chore for younger kids to haul back up the hill after each run.In sum, it looks great and runs well for older kids, but given the issues with the assembly I have concerns about the long term durability of the sled."

256816,0,"I bought this shirt to wear to the gym - but it runs very small and is tighter than I had hoped for. I am keeping the product, however, because I can always use it to ""layer"" under other items when the weather gets cool. The product is well made and did not run or shrink in the laundry process."

I started to tape around the wrists but the fringe of the torn seams became uncomfortable. Had they been more durable I would have given them 5 stars."
