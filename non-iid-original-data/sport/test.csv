35112,0,"I purchased this item because I needed a mirror (I use my mtn bike for occasional commuting and hauling a kiddie trailer) and a set of bar ends for those long rides. I liked the clean looks when the mirror was folded away.The grips actually feel not too bad when the mirrors are closed, but when the mirrors are in the open position, it feels a little strange gripping a hollowed out bar. I would personally prefer a solid rounded bar. Also, because of the design, rear view is pretty narrow top to bottom, so these are only good for riding on smooth surfaces. I should add the mirrors are convex and not flat. The surfaces of the mirrors are not perfectly curved (I find this to be true with most plastic mirrors), so you do get some distortion. You'd get much better field of vision using a helmet-attached mirror or by attaching a larger rounded mirror to the handle bar--though with this set you'd have two mirrors.Otherwise the construction seems sturdy enough that I would think the mirrors would survive minor collisions and falls when closed."

242853,0,"Russell Athletic Long Sleeve Tees I purchased a few years ago were made of heavy (I mean heavy) material. This shirt, while nicely made, is not nearly as heavy, the most important characteristic that I wanted in my tee. The addition of a tasteful logo on the sleeve cuff is meant to compensate for the reduction in cotton fiber?"
121428,0,The rubber in goggle is too hard for toddler. And the head band is quite fuzzy as it keeps moving.
54036,0,"This is a pretty decent shirt just be aware it is cotton so it will tend to shrink in the wash just something to consider when ordering for size. I am a pretty big guy at 6' 280lbs. not in a round sense but length wise and it's kinda hard for me to find XL shirts that fit me in length as well as width (im kinda chesty too) and these shirts are good for that, the neck is kinda tight for me but that just might be me, anyways all in all these shirts are good for hitting the gym or just being lazy at home. Good price but if your skeptical order one and see how you like it."
383253,0,"Really no complaints here. This is an inexpensive bike, and you'll get exactly what you pay for.Positives:-Small.-Easily stored and put away.-Easily assembled.-Fairly quiet (though not as silent as other reviews imply).-Basic bread-and-butter bike; no useless bells and whistles.Negatives:-Doesn't ride smoothly when resistance is increased.-Resistance doesn't differ much as you change levels.-Calorie counter is so laughably off that it's of no use whatsoever.-Seat can be adjusted only minimally. I'm 6ft, and the bike is a bit too small for me."

419982,0,The only problem is I think they run just a little smaller than other athletic shorts in the size small.
379496,2,"I bought two of these with the idea that redundency in emergency supplies was prudent. I have flash lights and a battery lantern so these two little items seemed a cheap back up if the batteries fail. They do not put off enough light to read braille by! Save your money and either buy a LED battery lantern and buy extra batteries, or buy an oil lamp. These are a joke!"
300523,0,"We ordered a 430 on February 10th, had it shipped on the 11th (for free with Super Saver...such a great deal), and received it on the 13th. We assembled it without any real difficulty in about 1.5 hours on the 14th.One piece of advice, as some others have said, is to definitely use your own tools instead of relying on the ones they provide. A good socket/ratchet for the hex-head bolts and Allen wrench bit/ratcheting screwdriver for the other bolts will go a long way. The directions were basically ""clear enough,"" and about par for the course as I've found these things to be.The trainer worked fine that evening and yesterday (the 15th), for about 35-45 minutes total running time. Very smooth, all the display features, modes, etc. worked just fine. As others have posted, it was very smooth and very quiet.This morning, my wife went to use it and found that there was a rubbing noise coming from the main flywheel body area, and the machine was not at all smooth when walking forward (backwards was smooth).I took the arms and legs off and gave it some lithium grease, although I could hear that the sound was coming from inside the flywheel body area. Still, figured it couldn't hurt. While I had the arms and legs off, I rotated the flywheel by hand and found it alternately sticking/rubbing and smooth.Now that everything's back together, the problem persists. I called Nautilus tech support this AM and they were very friendly and helpful. They tell me that a new crank pulley assembly is on its way via Fedex from Kentucky, and should be here by the 20th. Then, they said that their on-site repair guys will call to schedule an appointment.To be continued...UPDATE (2/20/09): The part showed up via Fedex as expected. We received a phone call the day before saying that we'd get ANOTHER call once they saw the part had been delivered. This call would be the one to use to schedule the service call.UPDATE (2/22/09): Got a call from a service company that they're coming out to fix the machine next Saturday, the 28th.UPDATE (03/01/09): The repair guy showed up on time, was very nice, and fixed the problem. Bad tension spring, which probably worked itself out in shipment. Now the thing works like a charm!"
328488,1,"I USED TO WORK OUT WITH BOXERS UNDER MY SHORTS... NOW THAT I OWN ONE OF THESE, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTABLE MY WORKOUT IS. I USE THEM FOR JOGGING AND SOCCER. IT'S GREAT FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY KIND OF EXERCISE. WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!"
173098,1,"Just got it, it's very easy to set up (nothing to do besides set up the two poles and the straps to hold them in place). Just do the opposite to take it down. Fully recommend it."
19856,1,The watch is what I expected. Compass is especially cool. The basic functions of the Barometer and Altimeter are good. The Advanced features of the Barometer and Altimeter something I will never use.
10986,1,Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it. I really liked the color of it because its so different.
488867,0,Useful but I had to contact Timex for a replacement due to accuracy in using the product but I would purchase again when neded
400507,0,"Nice gloves.. except the thumb position. My thumbs in the gloves are almost vertical and there is so much material I couldn't bend thumbs into proper punching position, causing some really nasty jams and fractures in my thumbs... don't buy these if your actually boxing people."
70991,0,The scooter assembled quickly until we got to the rear brakes. We could not get the brakes to tighten. We were disappointed that instead of giving a troubleshooting idea the instructions told us to bring it in to a bike shop. We did and they were able to tighten the brakes completely.
462424,0,"I purchased this product after using the foam rollers at the gym for a few months.I like the way the massage roller is put together. It's quite solid, and I doubt I would ever have a problem with it.However... it sits too close to the ground to be useful. I mainly need it on my upper leg, but with as low as it sits to the floor, it is difficult to get enough weight/pressure on it. My lower leg drags on the floor even with effort to keep it elevated (which makes it difficult to relax the upper leg muscles).It really needs some more clearance. The foam rollers support my leg about six inches above the ground (plenty of room to generate pressure while relaxing the muscles), but this barely gives three inches."
435478,0,The quality of the hat wasn't really that great from what I had expected from a New Era hat. Some of the stitching on the top triangle overlaps another. This creates somewhat of a lopsidedness to the top of the hat.
496216,0,The shirts are nice but the sizes are extremely roomy. I bought a couple of these for my dad who is pretty stocky and always wears and x-large but these were very big on him.
283664,0,The glove fit well and the leather is a good quality. I'm satisfied with the purchase.
414943,1,"I've owned several 'hawk-bill' knives and have been carrying a plain blade Byrd Crossbill daily for probably 5 years or so. The knife is excellent for everyday activities like opening boxes, cutting rope, branches etc etc. I even open bottles with the non-blade side. Looks intimidating & could be very effective for self defense if used like a karambit. The blade comes razor sharp and sharpens nicely. Have always been impressed with how solid the locking mechanism is on this knife!Only reason I'm here now is because I've carelessly dropped mine several times on concrete over the years and the tip is missing a really small chip. Figured it was time for a second one."
494730,0,"i bought this to use when i got my trainer. the wattage is figured to be riden on the trainer, no wind or elevation changes. also i liked the fact that it had a calorie counter which was going to used to determine how many beers i could have after a ride. installation was simple, but my cadence counter doesnt work, and the bottom line is hard to read. also the calorie counter or cal. burned is not working. i left it on b/c im too lazy to send it back. would recommend it for the trainer for the wattage , but not for road use, i will get a garmin for that."
447245,1,exelente saque bass de 12 libras con este se&ntilde;uelo y una linea de 30libras de hecho es tan bueno que compre 12 mas luego de comprobar lo bueno que es se lo recomiendo tanto a novatos como a expertos
215909,2,"I agree with Lawrence Lynn. I wore this vest outside, under a winter coat, and could barely feel any heat. These vests are heated by electrical resistance. This always uses a lot of power (think electric stove) and the two, tiny 3.7 V batteries that come with the vest are just not enough. The vendor is letting me return the vest (which I will)."
314181,1,"I love it, it fit well, stayed close to my body, very form fitting to the hip. I had no probable with running and doing any type of training. I will be buying one for my M&P but it will be the drop leg since I can switch everything back and forth. I will have drop leg, belt, and the paddle attachment. I really like the idea the Blackhawk came up with, I will also be buying the fast attachment for my vest. I would highly recommend this to any law enforcement or civilian because it is the best!"
191336,0,Quality ?I can't say this Slate with holder is good quality.But holder is good to attach my BC.
197554,0,"Razor pro model was a popular choice of pro scooters when trick scootering first came out, because thats all there was.Now 10 years later, the razor pro model has been left behind in place of district scooters, lucky scooters, blunt scooters, and its new and better brother: the razor ultra pro. I highly recommend the razor ultra pro lo, because it has lower handlebars then the razor ultra pro. For only 10$ more you can get the Razor ultra pro lo right here on amazon. So save your money just a little longer kids, be patient, its worth it!"
303908,2,"These did not really work for me as my kiking boots seemed too wide to accomodate the cleats, and then they kept popping off while trekking."
217609,1,"I knew these Frisbee flew well because I saw a couple of people playing with them, which is why I ordered it. But I didn't know how well they flew! I threw this Frisbee with the same force as I would a normal disk, and it flew straight and went right past my girlfriend. She was maybe 10 or 15 meters away, and the Frisbee easily went three times her distance. We now stand about 50 meters apart and easily toss it to each other and we are still screaming ""Back up!"". The wind has little effect on the Frisbee also.I didn't like how Amazon shipped my Frisbee. The box is about 1/2"" smaller than the Frisbee is wide so the corners were bent down. If you have this problem, lay it on a flat surface and use a blow dryer on it. The edges will slowly return to their proper shape, but don't let it get too hot - heat will damage it easily."
296836,0,"picture should just have valance part and not curtains, thought i had purchased the entire set was a little disappointed to realize i still need curtains. quality ok overall"
215922,0,Cant carry my cell or wallet as it doesnt have any pockets
38013,1,"My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size. The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece. The vest itself let me wanting a little more. The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest. It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer. I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight, but for the price I paid I'd have to say it matches the quality. I guess I expected a little more from Columbia, as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations. Guess I'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase. The style and color are nice, but I also got the ""bunching"" effect during active use, maybe better as a low activity use item, walking around town and such. It really comes down to what you'll be using it for, activity level and quality of other layering items."
69894,1,Purchased to keep the cold air out of my eyes while riding my motorcycle during winter months. Works beautifully. Got a pair for the wife who frequently rides with me.
170831,0,"It's my own fault, I suppose. You see everyone on the kitchen shows with their reversible grills and think you need one, too. First the positive: This is an excellant price and you can't beat with the free shipping offer. For some this would be a great additional to your kitchen but not for little ole' me. First it takes a long time to season and is quite heavy. Since you can't put it in the dishwasher (dah) you have to wait for the grease to cool, use paper towels to soak it up, then haul it over to the sink for a cleaning without a hard brush, no soap. Then make sure you dry it well as it might rust. Just know what is involved before purchasing. For someone like me that uses it once every other week, it's wasn't the smartest thing I've ever purchased."
223198,1,My kind of sweats. Relaxed fit. Color stands up to numerous cleanings. Very reasonably priced. Good service by company. Have worn them a lot since purchase.

428038,1,Seems to work well. Hard to turn on and off. The base is weak so don't try to force it into hard ground.
460628,0,"I'm a little bit over 5'5&#34; so wasn't sure which one I should buy, 55 cm or 65 cm. Last ball I owned was 55 cm and it felt a bit small so this time I bought 65 cm. I think I made a right choice. I don't need to blow a ball to its maximum size to get right height (knee bent at a 90 degree angle when I sit on it) which makes the ball not too hard. When I used 55 cm I needed to blow it to almost max size so the ball was quite hard and not flexible. Overall I like this ball but my only complain (the reason for 3 stars not 4 stars) is a plug. Somehow it is quite hard to insert fully into the hole and hard to pull it out. I know it's not a big problem and tightness may help to seal it but my previous ball's plug was a lot easier to handle and didn't leak. Other than this, it's a good ball."
356159,0,Functional but not nearly as elegant as the towers with the tank in the base. As a result we seldom use it.
307761,0,"Inexpensive gun case that works well except fot the ""pillar"" in the middle,restricting many gun fitments. My SS Mini 14 with folding stock fits OK but the High Standard Police Model 10 Bull Pup won't fit around it at all. Go with the better all weather case from Plano if you want the best."
322199,1,Great item and ships fast! I love the gel padding and the wrist support.
444129,1,Thie is one impressive piece of hardware. It's a little bulky but easy to get used to although it doesn't always fit under my shirt cuffs. The charging system is excellent. The watch gets a lot of notice. The slide rule function is pretty complex to use but it adds to the impressive appearance of the watch. This watch looks much more expensive than it is.
257307,2,"I never wear this top after having purchased it. The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them. The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly. I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and, therefore, isn't very flattering. I think I've worn it once and will probably donate it soon. Generally, I have been pleased with Adidas products, but this shirt did not work for me personally."
282428,1,"these little blinkies were easy to install and work great. Very bright and wide viewing angle so cars on the side can see you blinking. Choose between flashing, solid on, or off with a small button. Others have complained the button was too small, but I had no problems. Installation was easy, and its feels very sturdy once installed. to change battery, you need to just stick a coin into the side of the plastic covering for the light and it pops off easily. This concerns me on longtime durability, but the price is worth the chance. If you need these lights as headlights to see where you're going, they can suffice somewhat, but a bigger front light may be desired. BATTERIES INCLUDED!"
336557,0,"It was tough for me to rate this item. I have several Fobus products and am very happy with them all and Amazon did a great job as usual shipping the order. My problem is that if I am reading the description on both this page and Fobus's site correctly this paddle holster is supossed to fit the S&W Sigma 40E, It does not come close to fitting the Sigma 40E. I took the slide off and it went right in but with the slide on it was ugly. Anyways, what I did was gradually heat the portion of the holster that covered the slide with a plumbers torch then remolded the holster to the gun. I am fearless about stuff like this and ended up with a decent fit but just so you know the holster now looks less than new for sure. What I can tell you is this; if you are ordering this for a S&W Sigma 40E it will no fit. Hope this helped, good luck."
194498,0,"I have been doing the Zumba series at my church and really love it. We do the newer collection cardio sculpt & tone, express workout. Most of the steps are shown in an easy breakdown format. The soundtrack is awesome,really gets you moving. When I purchased this advanced Zumba I thought it would be just like the one I did in class. However, it was not. There is very minimal English instructions.It's mostly Spanish. The dancers are scantily clad like another review stated.The soundtrack not so hot.(and voices are not clear).It reminds me of a bootleg copy. The moves are advanced, some I could not do(I know It is advanced Zumba).I really recommend getting the beginners from the same series. Don't be like me and assume you'll jump right in full swing. I must say I am not the avid dancer, nor the most coordinated person so maybe it's just me."
506194,0,The bottom section needs more stability to keep it from collapsing on the shoes and other items that are placed in that section.

321742,0,"I bought this coat in both blue and green - after reading the reviews that it does not have side pockets. I bought them at REI as they were on sale for 114.00. The colors are amazing - and on the first day I wore the green one I got compliments from almost everyone I ran into. I skied in it at Breckenridge in sub zero temperatures and it kept me very warm. I just make sure when I wear it I wear something under it that has pockets - ie: A down vest or a hoodie with pockets to keep my phone etc. If running around town it is not as big a deal as I usually have my purse.So as long as you are willing to deal with the no pocket part - it is a really, really cute jacket, very flattering, great colors, and suprisingly warm. However having said all of that I would not buy it unless it is on sale..."
335030,0,"I was a bit disappointed in the towel. I thought it would have been a bit thicker, more plush. My son (who was the recipient of this gift) was happy with it though--bright colors and large."
56824,2,I wish I could say that these are awesome but I couldn't even get them on. I have small hands. I am 5 4 and my pinky barley comes out of my mma gloves. I was hopng smalls would be perfect. Well these things were tiny. For a very young adult at best. O well.
92890,1,"I bought this watch 10 years ago and I'm still wearing it! I've replaced the battery and crystal a few times, but overall the quality is superb and it looks great. Very classy in my opinion."
321354,0,"I chose this cap because it says it's cut to fit over long hair, but apparently not hair as long as mine. My hair is down to my hips and it doesn't fit under the cap. Otherwise it's a great cap if your hair isn't quite so long."
494552,2,"I received the wrong size. Contacted seller who said he would check the warehouse. Have not heard back from him. Product is great, but I would have liked to have received the size I ordered."
395621,0,I like the miles calculator and the software to summarize a month or more data.Be sure to use the safety strap. The belt clip does not stay on well.Would buy again.Jim
467841,0,"We've only played with these a few times. They are good for my 7 year old to see if he's interested in lacrosse. The sticks are the right size for him, but small enough that it is difficult for me to play catch with him. I just hope the handles last long enough for him to decide. They are ""bendy"" plastic. I haven't assembled the goal yet, but I don't think I'll be impressed with it."
8892,0,I love these shorts for lounging around the house on de-stress days. They are comfortable and soft and great for sleeping in during the Summer months.
328192,0,"Wow. These ran small. Very thin.Used them as pants for an ""Ooompa Loompa"" costume. Kids had to wear white underwear w/ NO pattern -so as not to show through on stage.BUT, they came in time."
429166,1,"A friend of ours had a similar one of these, so when my husband started running again, I got it for him and he was so grateful for the relief it provide for his cramping leg muscles after a run.My daughter is an athlete too, and she uses it after tough workouts. They're both so glad we have it!"
248818,1,Just the right size and weight. They work well around the house and would be great to take to a concert as well.
324977,0,I built a frame for this net out of PVC and it fits just fine...after making several adjustments to the original dimensions. But its pretty much exactly what it says it is. :)
249322,2,"I purchased this fan for a weekend camping trip in humid 90 degree weather. It worked pretty well on the first night....on high, there was significant circulation to my upper body when placed to air mattress on a small table. Unfortunately, the fan wouldn't turn on the next night. I installed fresh batteries and still nothing. I opened up base to discover a faulty switch...it wasn't making contact properly. I thought I fixed it, but once jostled too much, would not make contact again. Ridiculously shoddy craftsmanship, which SUPER surprises me with a Coleman product."
287411,0,"Product arrived in time and the tire levers work well.BUT, the two levers are NOT AS PICTURED. The levers with the kit all have the hook that connects to the wheel spokes. The picture describes a lever with a hook for spokes, and another lever with a clip for spokes. This is not what arrives in the package. Still, the product works as needed.Shipping was fast. Still happy overall. I would recommend the levers. They work and they could not be cheaper."
157930,1,"First, I want to say thanks for all the spot on reviews! You don't know how tough it was to buy a putter without trying it.And I was not disappointed. I have only taken it to the practice putting green,but man... this thing is smooth & I love the weight & shaft. I'm short & the shaft is prefect for me,i think it was a 34"". For the price,you can't go wrong at all with this putter. Keep in mind,the paint and quality is not the same as a $130.00 putter,but it comes with a cover and I will take care of it so it wont chip I'm easy on my stuff. I went from an old ping putter to this,and I used my ping putter for 20 years.I have been behind in the new technology, but they want a lot of money for new putters. I'm happy!"
95907,0,"Pretty decent bottle and the pouch can almost fit a smart phone. The real draw back is the leaky valve. I've got another Nathan and have the same issue there. It's just slightly obnoxious, but it's better than running with a cup I suppose."
98136,0,Note that the PG-26 doesn't have the texture on the front to match the feel of the firearm grip like the other Pearce grips. I overlooked this and was quite disappointed as that's a major selling point to the Pearce grips.
281550,0,There is nothing special about the fishing line clipper. It's just a big clipper like one uses on fingernails. It is not necessary to have this because there are no other tools included on it. The only thing you can do with it is clip line. I was disappointed.
107007,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
498243,0,"This is a pretty good pair of boxer if you are a hiker or frequent traveler. The boxer sits good, doesn't roll up (great when you drive) and wrinkle. But they are far from odourproof. The traces of urine smell terribly on these undies since they stick to the fabric. Also drying time is not brilliant as advertised. Overall not a bad purchase but there is a lot of room for improvement."
420736,1,I bought these straps to attach my sleeping pad to backpack. They are long enough that I was able to use the extra strap to attach my sleeping bag.Work well.
216621,1,"I've used this tent for 4 camping trips now. Nothing hardcore just some state campground Memorial Day trips and the like. It's easy to set up, even managed in the dark a couple of times. Had rain once and it survived just fine and I was dry. We've had 3 people in it and I guess you could do 4, but it would be a pretty cramped night."
277315,0,"These are about 3-4 inches long and work fine but are nothing fancy. There are no labels or markings. If that's what you're looking for, these will do."
250722,0,"This light is a definite step up from other cheapies I've used in the past and the mounting bracket has been solid. The thing is, I recently bought a Planet Bike Superflash and it is leagues better--definitely worth the extra money. It seems roughly twice as bright and the blinking pattern is much more eye-catching. Plus, Planet Bike donates 25% of its profits to bike advocacy, so some of the extra money you'll spend will go to a good cause."
350335,2,The Band is fine if you only want to use it for upper body but I find it quite clumsy to attach the straps every time I need to change feet when I'm working lower body. The handles are also not big enough to comfortably put your foot through. I wear a US 8 shoe and I had to struggle to put my foot through which is quite annoying when you are in the middle of exercising to waste time with the equipment.
43996,0,"Had seen this & similar hoops in numerous homes & finally decided to buy one for myself. Got it at a good price, but 1st package did not look like brand new (re-packaged). Then, very difficult to install and even though being an engineer (maybe that could be the reason!!) the directions need to be followed very carefully and you need at least 2 string adults. Total time spent around 4 hours, with couple of mistakes that required dis-assembly and assembly again. Final last steps are tricky with no mention of optimal way of placing the poles & backboard & I ended up bending the entire backboard. Backboard also had some scratches and even though Amazon was nice enough to allow a free return, I did not have the heard to dismantle the whole unit and package it back.Not a happy experience and on hind sight, would rather pay a professional and get an in-ground unit. Overall quality of end product is decent (cannot ask for more for price)."

263617,0,"I've had several comments-people really think it's a Rolex. It's a very good looking watch, I love wearing it. However, there are times when the self-winding stops. I need to take it off my hand and vigorously shake it to get it going again. I don't know why Invicta didn't make it battery operated.

319188,1,"After sending back the North Face Triple C down jacket because it was too thin and cost over $300, I decided to give this one a try. It's perfect. I wanted warmth without too much bulk, and this fits the bill. I love the (removable) fur hood. The fleecy liner, including in the pockets, is incredibly soft. I'm 5'7 and 130 lbs and it fits perfectly. It covers me down to the bottom of my knees, and I just feel enveloped in luxurious warmth and softness. I might even enjoy this winter in New England! (Well, probably not, but it won't be for lack of warmth thanks to this fabulous coat.)"
325454,0,"My son's feet didn't fit in the footrests width-wise with shoes on, so he had to ride barefoot or with those water sock type shoes on. He outgrew it in general by age 2, but his feet were too big by 1 1/2, and he has normal sized feet. I really like that he sits in front of me, but make sure that your bike has a long frame. Mine is a cruiser and I had to ride with my knees slightly pointed out because his seat was so close to me. Overall, it's a nice idea, but the bike rides were too uncomfortable to really enjoy."

90936,0,"I've used this in the field for two shoots. The design is functional and excellent. The quality of manufacture is less so. The material in the pockets is rather light for holding heavier items like camcorder batteries. Worse, the quality of sewing in the seams is poor, with light thread and stitching and loose ends throughout, already starting to unravel after just six days in the field. I still like it and hope it lasts longer than I expect it to."
387269,0,"I bought this rope for my 7-year-old son who has taken a recent interest in jump roping. The rope is adjustable, although there are no instructions for how to adjust it - I had to figure it out for myself. He has been using it frequently for a week or two, and the beads are constantly breaking off. The red ones went first, but now the black ones are starting to break. It's a nice rope with good handles, but the beads need to be made from a more durable plastic."
449185,1,"This is an awesome product. Unless you have a superhuman grip strength, however, do not buy this first.Well, scratch that. Get this, the #1 and the #2. Then get the #3 out of the package, and try and close it.With diligent and intelligent training, you will one day get the #3 to close like a castanet.And at that point, you will have INCREDIBLE hand strength. You will be able to do things with your hands you never thought you'd need to be able to do - cut metal with way substandard bolt cutters, use cheap wrenches that people in Home Depot assure you you'll never manage a job with, telling you you'll need much more expensive torque multiplying wrenches to use.The #4 is my next goal. It's INHUMAN. Only four men on this planet have closed it, and there's some who think you might need genetic gift to reach that plateau.But make no mistake, the #3 is a superhuman feat, and it's the benchmark by which strong hands are judged."

323791,1,"Did some research before buying this pump, exchanging several emails with the manufacturer. Got all my questions answered and received a copy of the specs before I ordered (not a great document, but it served its purpose). I was very wary of the earlier reports about leakage, but I was confident from my communications with the manufacturer that if I had a problem, it would be taken care of. Happy to report that there is no leakage whatsoever; the unit was easy to install and easy to use. A few pumps and I had water. Given the low price, I'm happy to recommend this."

2532,0,"This was our first bike rack - we chose it based on customer reviews and the reputation of Saris. I liked it before we put it on the car - it's solid and the strap system is very secure. Mounting the rack onto the car was very straightforward. But... it took forever to get all 3 bikes on! The mounts are so close together that pedals were jamming into wheels, handlebars were jamming into seats, etc. One of our bikes is a child bike - if it weren't, I'm not convinced that we would have been able to mount all three. I suspect that this is a common problem. It would have been helpful if the mounting instructions included some tips for positioning things.We also dented the back of the trunk door the first time we used the rack. Since then, we've positioned it lower so it pushes on the fender, and have not had any trouble. But again, a note about this in the instructions would have been nice."
485566,0,"I guess we should have looked more into this product. It is very small and hard to ""fit"" your stuff into (if you know what I mean). My wife didn't have any problems using it, but she is only 5'2"". I am 5'11"" and squatting down to use this thing is quite uncomfortable. As far as the construction of it, what can I say? It's plastic. It will hold you and not fall over.It's pretty lightweight and it's nice to have a place to hold your toilet paper roll. We use this on camping trips (tent camping). We had a small 2 person tent we were going to use as the ""restroom"". The tent was way too small to use 'cuz if you were squatting down in there you were hunched over so much that it was too uncomfortable. Not the toilets fault I know, but if you plan on having a separate area to use this, I suggest one of those tee-pee type tents where you can stand.Overall, it serves its purpose. For men, if you've got to go No. 1, find a tree. If you've got to go No. 2, good luck. Hopefully you won't be making a mess (go No.1 first, standing up, then No.2 sitting down). Yeah, a bit of a pain, but necessary if you don't want to make a mess."
234509,1,We had gone through three pairs of goggles each since last year for our children. They are on the swim team and none of the goggles would stay on them securely while diving in the pool. I overheard a mom telling another mom about the Hydrospex Jr goggles being the best goggles out there. I ordered a pair for each of my children and they work wonderfully! All three of them mentioned to me that these goggles are awesome. I would definetly buy these again in the future.

The cost is not enough to return it.It just looked as if someone ripped of the size label.

My mom put one koozie on top and bottom and says it works."

152244,2,"I bought a Yakima kayak rack 2 years ago and love it! However, one strap had worn, so I ordered the Yakima Heavy Duty replacement straps, naturally. Caution: same great buckle, but the straps were MUCH lighter duty than the origional straps. Useing a Starrett micrometer, the origional straps measured .072 in thickness while the replacement straps measured only .039 thickness. After only one use, the new strap is showing wear...what a disappointment. Oh yeah, on the flip side, the replacement straps are about 4 feet longer than the origional straps, but I didn't need more length...I'm transporting a kayak, not a Boston Whaler!"
469844,1,"Light output is very high and the beam pattern is very smooth. Beam is a bit narrow, but it's adequate for walking a trail at night. Voltage regulator makes it easier to tell when the batteries need to be changed. My last headlamp didn't have one and it got dimmer and dimmer so gradually that I didn't notice the batteries needed to be changed until I compared the brightness to someone else's headlamp. There are rubberized strips on the inside of the headband that hold it securely and prevent it from sliding down so I don't miss having the third strap over the top of my head. I'm happy with it so far."

451702,0,"So, I thought, at last, a safe that's made in America, I can't go wrong, I will support the manufacturing base in the US and in return I'll recieve a quality item. The package turned up, I looked at the box and the dreaded 'Made in China' glared at me. Oh well, I thought, let's see what the score is. Although the strongbox part of it is fairly adequate as a basic temporary stowage, very easy to program and get working, it's the other bits on it that give me the impression that the lazy bleeder that assembled it just wanted to get home at the end of a long day in Beijing or wherever the moron lived. One of the top shelf supports was hanging off,the result of very lacklustre brazing (or I suspect, glueing) the retaining clips to hold the actual top shelf on dropped straight through the clip holes and were about as useful as Anne Franks drumkit. The shelf 'padding' (hahahaha, yeah right, about 25 cents worth of thin ineffectual foam if that!) for the bottom shelf had become trapped in the bent, skewed top shelf and was ripped almost completely in half. The cover for the locking mechanism had a screw that was not actually missing, it was just that the bonehead that assembled this particular unit couldn't be bothered to line up the last of three screws and just jammed the bugger in. Honestly, does ANYBODY ever check these things anymore? Why the hell does Chinese made stuff routinely mean crappily made or assembled merchandise? Oh, and the front door support face was slightly dented..in three places. Almost $70 I paid for this.As mentioned, as a basis lock box, it's pretty decent, hence the three stars, but innards and quality control could be looked at.Don't think I'll be using this for too long to stow my pistols. Bass Pro, here I come."
181387,0,"This is a top-notch tool except for the interchangeable bits. I'm not hard on tools, but the torx drivers and the flat blade driver are brittle rather than strong and can break after a few months or in some cases just a few uses. The large Phillips bit seems more durable but still shows visible wear after a few months. The Posidrive bit, however, showed no wear after several years, but I had to replace each of the other bits at least twice in four years. Not only that, but the bits aren't exactly cheap ([...] plus [...] shipping) for that price, it seems like they could make the bits out of a stronger material that would last more than a year or two.Other than that, the many other functions of this knife have been very durable with no sign of wear other than the plastic case which shows the minor scratches and abrasions you'd expect from rubbing against a pocketful of keys for four years. Overall I am happy with my purchase, I just they made the driver bits as tough as the rest of this fine tool."

177586,0,"The Overall quality is ok. However the joint between the blade and the shaft(rod thing) of the kwan dao is not very solid. It uses a very small welding cord in the middle. The plate and the blade are not weld together which adds to the same problem. This causes the weapon's blade to tremble a little bit on mid swing and It doesn't provide me with much confidence (I am only a manufacturing engineer, this may be per design and completely acceptable for its intended use). That said, It has not broken yet and no cracks are visible, also it has perform very well in the couple of times where it was used for an exhibition."

I used only a few of the supplied pieces from both sets to install this on a sloped roof."
343023,0,"After finally getting this unit due to back-order problems this past summer it appears manufacturing is a bit rushed. The instructions for the drywall ceiling installation are incorrect in stating that a 3/8"" bit should be used for the pilot hole. As the bolts themselves are 3/8"" you'll have to be smarter than me or plan on a second set of holes. Also, the first bolt I screwed into the ceiling snapped while tightening -- and I'm no Joe Weider. Lastly, on one of the bolts, the machining was just off such that I couldn't get the socket over the head and had to use a wrench.After finally getting the hoist installed the hooks, straps, cable and pulleys all work very well. But I'd suggest getting better hardware and remember to check your pilot hole drill bit first against your bolt."
107917,1,"Nice pants, generously sized - I often take a 36 waist, and the days of 34 are in the past... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two: a pencil/screwdriver shaft section plus the rest, which isn't quite big enough for a smartphone. Get a seam unpicker though, and you can turn it into one larger pocket that's ideal for a phone, complete with light velcro fastener at the top.All pants should have a phone pocket these days, preferably a subtle one."
108697,0,This ball is huge and feels soooo good when you lay back to get a good stretch. I bought this (the largest one) to help ease back pain and recovery from a c-section. It's doing wonders in helping to get that stretch I need and makes sit ups a little easier too. Also an added bonus is that it's become a great thing for baby and me... when he's fussy we just bounce!
273638,0,"The size was very uniform, however the flat part was not always flat and sometimes after they were mounted, the feather tilted. I made my own arrowheads and shafts so the following part may be my fault... Anyhow, when I shot the arrows, [23 in total] about two of them slivered from the front and lodged in my skin between the thumb and finger. Also there was a small rash that developed after the first of four shooting rounds...probably because I was not wearing a shooting glove. All in all I was happy with the performance, and when I was finished shooting, a quick run between my thumb and finger realigned the vanes. What I enjoyed more than anything was testing my self made Maple bow and Dogwood bow, both of which could use some perfecting...Happy shooting!"
438157,2,"I purchased a Topeak MTX BeamRack EX about 6 months ago. Within that time, the rubber bungee cord that is used to strap items to the rack has dry-rotted, cracked and ultimately snapped. Additionally, the plastic on the rack itself has become noticeably discolored and faded. I have never even used the bungee to strap anything to the rack, which is why I am both surprised and disappointed in the product so far. I would not have been so surprised had I kept this rack near sunlight, but it has been sitting on a shelf in my garage, far away from any direct sunlight.I paid approximately $40 for this product and I fully expect a product costing this amount to hold up longer than 6 months. I was planning to purchase a compatible RX trunk bag, however I am skeptical due to the poor quality of the product so far."

I enjoy snorkelling and swimming with my watches, and especially with those that claim 100m.water resistance or more.I took it along with me on my most recent trip down south to Cuba. Eager to discover the local reefs I promptly put on my sub diver watch, grabbed my fins, mask and snorkel and headed for the beach. While snorkelling I occasionally glance at my watch to check the time, and to my horror I discover the bezel has fallen off! Keeping in mind this is a 3 month old watch I can't believe it, but yes the sub-divers bezel is now part of the Cuban reef in Santa Maria...it would appear that the bezel was simply glued on and warm sea water was enough to dislodge the bezel from its mount.The watch is now back with Invicta for warranty repairs...sigh. Let's hope it doesn't take too long for a new bezel. I'm not sure I'll be wearing it again in the water for obvious reasons."
170121,2,"I'm 40, hate to exercise, have low-grade sciatica and want to lose 30lbs and get toned. When I heard about T-Tapp, I was very excited. It sounded perfect: a no-impact workout routine great for people with chronic pain issues that would take a minimal amount of time to produce fast results, and works without dieting.I got the Basic Plus video from the T-Tapp website. I did the instructional workout 4 times, and during that time my sciatica flared up and I had a level of back pain I haven't had in 10 years. After stopping the workouts, the pain lasted for two weeks. And not cramping, mind you, but sharp recurring pains day and night. I also had some ankle and knee pain. I thought of giving up, but I REALLY wanted T-Tapp to work for me. So I called them to see if I could exchange the video for the MORE workout video (for people with chronic pain) and pay the difference, but they don't accept returns. So, since I had a 30% off coupon, I bit the bullet and, despite my doubts, bought the MORE video. I did the MORE instructional workout 3 times and got the same results: back, knee and ankle pain.Now I know a T-Tapper will tell me that I wasn't doing the form properly. That may be true, but I went onto the forum and read administrator's advice and followed that. I looked in a mirror. I practiced the KLT 'stance' before doing the workouts. If after all that, I still can't get the form right and it's causing me pain, I can't help but conclude that the workout is either too complicated or just not suited to my particular body. It made my body feel horrible. I'm in pain as I write this.The interesting thing is that almost all the T-Tapp exercises involve moving in ways that people with back problems are always advised not to do: bending down from the waist (and rocking in that position too), twisting the upper body backwards and then bending down while twisting, and the like. Same with knee issues (which I don't usually have): doing lunges and plies and things that put pressure on the knees. So while I was doing these exercises, I felt like I was breaking every single rule I knew about how to avoid back and knee pain. Every time Theresa commented that ""this move is very rehabilitative,"" it was a move that hurt me. It's really hard for me to understand how so many people with back and knee issues can have great results with T-Tapp, but I'm glad it works for them.I considered trying the Chair or Floor exercises on the MORE video. But it just doesn't make sense to me that I would have to do exercises meant for people with serious chronic issues just because the regular exercises CAUSED me to have those issues in the first place! So I gave up and listed all my videos on eBay (the only way to recoup my losses). I'm very sad to say that I'm one of a supposed minority for whom this didn't work. (I say 'supposed,' because the whole operation smacks of MLM tactics.)A commenter on one of the reviews of the book said she was also having pain with the workout, and she got help on the phone from T-Tapp to correct her form, and the pain stopped. Part of me is tempted to try this, but my deeper instinct is to run the other way. And I also just found out that they recommend wearing cross-training shoes, which was not stated anywhere that I can remember in the book or the videos. I wore New Balance W715GB running shoes. Maybe cross-trainers would make a difference, but I don't feel like buying new shoes just to test out that hypothesis. If an exercise is that hard to learn and has that many risks to my body if I don't wear the exact right shoes and don't do it 100% correctly down to tiny minute details in my form, I'm not sure the risk or the financial cost is really worth it. After already paying about $100 for a month of pain, I'm kind of sour on the whole thing.I'm going back to the 10-Minute Solution series, which costs far less, is easy to do, causes me no pain, and will only take an extra hour out of my week than T-Tapp in its maintenance stage would.P.S. To read more reviews of the videos, look at the book's page, which has a ton because the book used to be the only thing sold by Amazon.Fit and Fabulous in 15 MinutesP.P.S. If you comment on this review telling me that I just need to correct my form, I will reach through my computer and very sweetly throttle you. :) If you love it, more power to ya. I am done with it!"

166728,0,"I'll make this quick. Not the best build quality, but for the price what would one expect. It was good until he middle section started to sag. Once that occurs, it will no longer support the lower back; hence, screwing your sleeping posture and many sore-back-mornings."
357420,0,its a very basic type of lantern. the single mantle is all i needed for some emergency lighting. The knob that turns up the lantern is not too sensitive. After about a quarter turn the lantern reaches it full brightness and the remainder of turning doesnt change the brightness at all. Same to dimm the lantern~you have to go almost to the off position to see the light get dimm. This will work for me. No carry case for the $23 bucks.
260666,0,"JumpSnap really does provide a good aerobic workout--if you can get past the DVD ""fun"" and move on to your own music. If I had been reminded one more time to have fun I would have thrown both JumpSnaps at the TV. Turn off the volume, put on your ipod and follow the leader. The three levels of training are challenging and it is easy to use your own moves, which may include staying on the floor rather than actually jumping (especially if you have bad knees). The DVD does demonstrate modified jumping. Having to use a tiny Phillips screwdriver to open the battery case is absurd and time consuming. There are no instructions as to how to hold and turn the handles to avoid wrist injury. If you rotate from the wrist you could wind up with some serious pain. Moving the whole arm or rotating from the elbow to hand seems to be the most effective way of jumping.In spite of the annoyances it is a good concept and I will keep using it as it is portable, easy to use while jumping around the house."

21842,0,"This is a good starter. The mag life if pretty good, and the accuracy is the best with .20 bb's. the .12 will work just fine in these, but they aren't that accurate at a distance. after a while of playing with this, the cocking bolt bends, but mine hasn't broken off yet. The thing still works, it's just bent. The rail on the top is made for .22 scope or red dot sight. I put my old .22 scope on it, and i love it. the thing is ok in durability. the tip can come of with some abuse, but if your careful, it wont. I let some guy borrow mine when we were playing, and he dropped it, and the front sight broke off. i glued it back together, but it isn't nearly as strong as when i first got it. all in all, this is a good starter."

Perhaps this was an oversight, but I'd check before you buy."

421681,2,"We boutght this for my son's 8th Birthday. He weighs 55 lbs. The product worked for one day, about an hour and half of riding. My son rode the product around our caldusac while I watched, my point is there was no funny business or abuse. When he went to use it the next day it was making a clicking sound when the engine engaged. I took the chain guard off and tried a couple quick fixes using the trouble shooting guide. I could not get it to stop clicking and the battery would not last more than 10 minutes, I assume due to whatever was causing the clicking. Granted I did not call their customer service, but quite frankly I'm tired of junk products that don't work and then I am supposed to waste an afternoon on the phone trouble shooting the product."

15010,0,"This item is pretty nice. The only problem we had with it is the logo on top is not smooth. It's very strange. Like when cheap particle board gets wet and expands, there is this rough, raised circle around the logo but under the paint. We never bothered to contact the manufacturer to see if we got a bad one.Overall, it's not a bad product. The rest of it is in great shape and it is easy to assemble and comes well packaged. But if any form of blemish on something that should be smooth offends you, you may want to call the manufacturer first to see if they are all like that."

I bought the GoFit Speed Rope and it broke in the 3rd use. just snapped in half by the rope.... For me it was a waste of my money, and I'll be staying away from GoFit products in the future.****** UPDATE******My original review was at 1 star but I have moved it up to 3. This is because of the customer service I received from GoFit. I complained to their customer service and received an email and a phone call apologizing for the poor product. Then to make up for it they sent me 5 jump ropes in a package via UPS. Pretty great CS."

76246,2,"I was expecting a lot more from Peltor. I used their high end headset with boom that connected to tactical radios in the past and was very impressed with their comfort and quality. These headphones are very poorly designed. To install the batteries you have to pop the plastic ring/ear muff portion off headset (on both ear muffs) every time and you feel like your going to snap some plastic off-and it is relying on pressure on a piece of plastic instead of having a battery case or some type of threaded positive holding area for the batteries, which are cheaply pushed into to two pieces of metal right next to the working ""guts"" of the the device. You literally have to disassemble the ear muffs to replace the batteries. The volume is independent for each ear, which is the type of thing I have not seen since the '80s with cheap disco radio headsets from radio shack. Does not come with batteries, does not have an AUX port for headset or MP3, Tactical Radio, vehicle COMMS system or anything (Howard Leigh did and provided batteries, and only used two AAA unlike Peltors that use 4 AAA). Yes I realize this was not in the description but It sure is a nice feature that cost them next to nothing to put on headset (see the Howard Leigh)Order both see what I mean, compare them side by side-take them shooting or just mow the yard with them. These Peltors are a bit of a let down.As for the Howard Leigh's, I never heard of them until I ordered a set from Amazon and were extremely impressed.I luckily purchased a Howard Leigh headset at the same time([...], which simply blow the Peltors away."

They fit well, they are comfortable and rarely leak at all. Also, I am in the habit of giving them a spray of anti fog before workouts, and that works well as they don't fog up at all.

I just have to boil it every time it gets out of shape."

It is made of cheap plastic and, even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end, it's still coiled and kinked.

After a couple months, it is no longer spill proof and no matter how tight I try to screw the cap, it always ends up leaking into my lunch bag. And the bite piece is actually kind of annoying to get used to...it's like going back to sucking on a bottle. In saying that, it still does serve it's purpose pretty well, and makes it easier to take water with you wherever you go.NOTE about mold comments...hello, it's because you're not washing it regularly or well enough. duh. as if the bottle just creates mold on it's own and it's the bottle's fault.I do like the smaller version rather than this size, it's not as heavy, and easier to carry around."

My child tipped over, not just sideways but head first, at least 5 times within the first 30 minutes that he had the trike. I was so disappointed because we were so excited about giving it to him. The size seemed perfect and we thought he would be able to pedal. He couldn't even ride with his feet on the ground and pushing, because he still tipped over. BIG THUMBS DOWN FROM OUR FAMILY. NO ONE SHOULD PURCHASE THIS TRIKE IF THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PICK THEIR CHILD UP FROM THE GROUND CONSTANTLY."

It does look kind of cool on though."
419720,2,"Please, listen to the previous reviewers who talked about the difficulty in installing this seat. If you are not a bicycle mechanic, you really are better off finding a professional to do this for you. I say that after having spent the last 6 six hours or so working on this, and even though I have now successfully installed this seat and reassembled my bike, I don't trust that the bike wheel, gears, and brakes are all back the way they should be and I'm going to end up taking the whole shebang to a bike shop for them to check it anyway. Should have just paid them to do it up front and saved myself the aggravation. Having said that, the seat looks to be comfortable and safe and a good product. Quality of seat: 5 stars. Ease of installation: 1 star....I used the average of those two scores to come up with my three star rating.Note: It's now a couple of hours since I posted that review. I just tried to remove the seat from the bracket so I can load the bike in my car to take it to the shop tomorrow. I came a hair's breath away from slicing off the tip of my thumb in the process, and consider myself lucky to have only a bruised and swollen thumb that will probably lose its nail. Be careful of the front safety latch and sliding the seat off. And for sure don't let your kids anywhere near it. Now bumping my rating down to two stars and seriously regretting ever thinking about putting a seat on my bike...."
57278,0,"Update 1/18/2013:Sent it to SOG several months ago, they repaired it to satisfaction. The lock lever is still there, but it doesnt move now, maybe they just glued it shut I'm not sure what they did. Cant complain about the service, but should not have had to go through the trouble either. So it stays with 3 stars.Update 6/7/12:After about 4 months of daily use the safety lock is engaged every time I take it out of pocket. It's driving me nuts! I see no need for it too begin with, except to make it ""idiot proof"" but it didn't bother me till this happened. Hopefully SOG will repair/replace/REMOVE!. Dropped two stars for this poor design flaw.-----------------------------------I really like this folder. I dont typically carry a knife at all times, simply because fully functional knives are too large, and small knives have limited usefulness.The Twitch 2 finally strikes a perfect balance. It is small enough I don't even notice it's there in my pocket, and I can even still reach for change down deep. But it can also accomplish a wide variety of tasks. Any smaller or larger, I wouldn't like something about it. It is also very attractive, perhaps even deceivingly so. It's built well and works flawless. Shaving sharp from the box, and I know that literally because being a typical guy I just had to try it. I've not had it long enough to comment on edge retention but after much research, I have faith it'll last through a lot of use.I have zero complaints and I`m thankful for all the other reviews that led me to buy this. Maybe the clip is a little tight like some say, but is that a negative? Not to me. In my view that is confidence it'll be there when I need it.For this type of ""gentlemens knife"" only a Kershaw Leek is comparable in my opinion. I ended up choosing this due to the advanced locking mechanism, the good reviews all over the net, a slightly thicker blade than the Leek, and something just really cool looking about it."

The sword I received IS a deadly weapon -- very capable of hurting someone. So be very careful with this cutlass. The scabboard is made of wood with metal accents. The metal tip on my scabboard was very loose, so I glued it on (and realigned it to fit the scabboard nicely). All-in-all, this is a pretty good, pretty dangerous sword at a very nice price."

310735,0,"This is a perfect bag if you're looking for a way to carry a small SLR with an attached lens, and very little else. I really like this bag and will definitely get a lot of use from it. I already own a larger more fully-featured heavily padded camera bag, and rarely use it because it is just too bulky. This bag is perfect for most casual-photographer outings.I bought this based on specs at Crumpler's web site for my Canon 20D (same size as Canon 30D, 40D, and 50D). Crumpler suggests this bag for mid size SLRs like mine. It takes a little wiggle to get my camera into the bag and the fit would be better for a more compact SLR like the Canon XT, XTi, and XSi. If I had bought this at a brick and mortar store, I'd probably exchange it for a ""4 million dollar home"" for my particular mid-size camera.The bag looks great, Crumpler makes great-looking durable bags. This is my second Crumpler purchase. The bag has lots of little pockets that can hold small items like a spare battery or memory card. It does not have enough space for anything with any bulk at all, such as a charger, external flash, battery extender, or spare lens. The main flap is well designed with both a quick velcro closure, as well as a more sturdy clip-closure.I usually use Canon's budget 18-55is ef-s lens, and there is plenty of room for it. A slightly longer lens would fit. The tightness of my camera's fit is a width issue, not a length one.The bag really doesn't have any extra padding to speak of, just the fabric that it is constructed from. It's a camera-tote, not camera-armor. The bag's intent is obviously to carry a mid to small SLR with attached lens and offer light protection, with as little bulk as possible. It does this well.Highly recommended as a nice-looking minimalist bag to carry a small SLR cam. If you have a mid-size SLR, I'd recommend the ""4 Million"" instead."
410211,1,"(This review contains made up exercise names and references to an apartment that's probably messier than yours.)I bought this item a few weeks ago, and I love it! I have a stability ball that I used to use, but it was so big and cumbersome that I finally deflated it because I spent more time trying to get it out of the way than I did actually exercising with it, and its constant presence was driving my partner mad. Stability balls are great if you have a lot of space, but discs take up virtually no space at all, and I think I actually get a better workout on the disc, anyway.My favorite way to use it is while I'm listening to a book on my MP3 player. I'll stand on it for a while, then do various crunches and ""upside down bike riding"" and leg stretches, butt lifts with my feet or shoulders on the disc, etc. When I'm sitting around the house I sit on it on the floor. With my feet together, it's just as much if not more of a challenge to stay balanced as it was on the stability ball.And the best part of it is, when I'm done using it I can put it under a chair, toss it onto a pile of laundry, or just leave it in the middle of the floor because it's so easy to step over and doesn't stub toes in the middle of the night. Since my favorite time to exercise is right before bed, that gives this piece of equipment a definite advantage as far as I'm concerned!As far as comparing this stability disc to others, I haven't tried any others so I can't give you a definitive on that. However, I can say that it stands up well to my 2-year-old jumping on it, and my 275lb partner feels comfortable and safe using it. I love the massage side (and the fact that the other side is actually flat.) Also, the alignment of the brand name on the flat side and the place where the air goes in on the other side mean that I can step up on it with confidence knowing that I won't end up with my foot on the internal valve stem.I've lost 50 lbs in the past 5 months. Although I didn't have the stability disc for that entire time, and most of my loss was due to dietary monitoring, I feel confident saying that the sort of exercises I do on this disc are what has really helped me to tone up as I've lost weight, and I definitely plan to continue spending lots of time on it!"

You can before you run a mission so long as you have 20 minutes before hand to screw around with your vest and pouches to get them all mounted properly. Speed clips they are not.

244307,1,"I bought three of these shirts for my husband to wear to work. He does a lot of work outside and wears a short sleeved polo shirt as a uniform. In the winter, he is often freezing! These shirts look/feel awesome under his polo and he has worn them several times by themselves. He is of average height and build and they fit well. He has a little belly and these shirts hide it well. And they're not too long, not too short. He said the fabric is nice too - it draws away the sweat. Perfect!"
441995,0,"This is a good product that I have purchased for the second time mainly because it is heavier than the other options in the market and they help me strengthen my leg muscles when practicing kick at the swimming pool.

262534,0,"My 11 year old who never wanted to wear a watch before, remembers to put this one on every day. It fits well (and he's a stocky 11 year old). However, the size is more for a woman or a tween boy or girl. I think this is a good watch for the tween years but the colors, a muted cadet blue with grey, while gender neutral, will require more thought if intended for a female. Also, the face is a bit small and the color of the dial a bit washed out. Also, this is not a velcro band, this band has a buckle with holes. Band is comfortable padded leather."

Even though I realized this, and though I had some experience with grippers and weight lifting before, I still could not close this more than 4 or 5 times in a row to start.If you are new to grip training, consider getting a cheap gripper and/or use other methods to start and/or buy this knowing you may have to work up to even the lowest level of gripper that Captains of Crush offers. If you are a more advanced weight lifter, or have had past experience with grippers then this is where to start.That aside, this is an all metal, beautifully constructed gripper. It will last and it will give your hands a serious workout for as long as you need it to. This is going to last longer than you are."

416424,0,"I have two chalk bags, one of these, as well as a Mad Rock bag that I purchased from a local shop.The Black Diamond bag is a fine bag, but it's nothing special. The pull cord that is used to close the bag seems to fight you a little too much. It feels like the bag wants to stay open. In contrast, the Mad Rock bag closed quickly and smoothly with even the lightest tug.The Mad Rock bag has an adjustable waist belt with clasp that I really like, whereas this one just has a string that seems to only be useful for wearing around your neck.In my opinion, the adjustable waist strap is worth an extra couple of bucks, and I know Black Diamond sells some with that type of strap here on Amazon. I'd recommend going that route instead."

363558,0,"I don't dispute the positive reviews. There's another side: 1/Under stress of heavy workouts, a truly quick change of weight,(stripping sets), still requires switching to another set of dumbbells. 2/PB 's fork-selector requires focus & fine motor skill to align: Put in off-horizontal by a fraction of an inch, PB wont work. 3/The internal 2 1/2 weight is obviously not speedy. 4/The fork, fork attachment cord, & rods connecting left & right weights to each other are subject to damage. 5/There are painted parts that lose their finish. 6/ The cage design makes some exercises awkward, some impossible. 7/On quick movements such as swings, the rattling is unnerving. //Judging by the other reviews, PBs are perfect for many. Try before you buy. They weren't perfect for me. I won't advertise another brand here, but I traded a bit of speed for a much more solid DB."

When I opened this one I noticed that the fleece was alot softer and thinner. I also noticed that the Columbia logo was on the left side of the jacket and the logo on my original jacket is on the right. I don't know if that is relevant to anything, but the quality of this jacket is definately less than my original. I am not going to go through the hassle of a return because it is an okay jacket to wear around the house on chilly mornings. It came with a $50 price tag attatched and I know I would definitely not spend that much for this particular jacket."

492960,2,"I recently purchased these particular sweatpants for my disabled son. I have relied on the russell brand for a long time because of previous purchases. The last Russell pants I bought lasted almost eight years. With this recent purchase I have been extremely disappointed in the quality of the fabric. Even thought I bought these pants recently, after just several washings, they have been pilling with each wash and now they look like they are worn out and will just barely make it through this winter season ! I will have to start looking again for sweatpants for next winter, and I will not be purchasing Russell's sweatpants again !"

396677,1,"I purchased this knife over a year ago for camping and every day carry. It has not disappointed. This knife is the perfect size, large enough for every job I throw at it yet not heavy/bulky. The steel is amazing. It keeps a sharp edge for a long time and can be sharpened to razor sharpness if that is your desire. Personally I like the shape of the blade on the Centofante III more than the Centofante IV.I found flipping the clip to the opposite end allowed a more comfortable carry in the right pocket for a righty. The way the knife comes from the factory the jimping is up and exposed to the hand when reaching in the pocket, swapping ends allows the abrasive jimping down and out of the way.The one handed open design on the knife works great, opening with a satisfying snap. I have trouble going back to my other knives that require two hands to open, I am now spoiled with a one handed opener.Give this knife a try."
118671,1,"The Everlast Pro Style Training Gloves are a decent pair of gloves to train on the heavy bags with. They are ok for sparring but I would prefer something with a little more padding. The only slight issue that I have with the gloves is that they are a tight fit with wraps on. I use the Evergel 120"" speed wraps and it is a little hard to get the gloves on. I don't have big hands I have average sized hands. So if you have big hands I would try looking for a different pair. Overall, it is a good pair of gloves for hitting the heavy bag. I would just suggest to getting a thicker pair of gloves if you want to spar."
217312,1,"Got this for my 14 year old son, at his insistence, and couldn't be happier. He loves this punching bag. We filled the base with sand, as we were worried that water might leak onto the carpet. It's very sturdy, and the perfect size. He gives it a go around every day, for at least half an hour or more. Even my husband has gotten in on the action! My worries that it would look horrible in the family room didn't materialize because the black is fairly inconspicuous, and it can be shoved into a corner when we have guests."
13663,1,"I really like these socks. I used these socks during a rainy trail run. I knew my feet would be wet running through the creeks but it was also going to raining during the run. I was looking for something to prevent blisters on my toes from all the moisture. I didn't get any blisters on my toes during the race. I ended up buying 4 more pairs. I love them for running. I have small feet so I had to get used to putting them on; I have plenty of extra room at the little toes in the socks but I have never had a problem with my toes slipping out or becoming uncomfortable. I would recommend these socks. They are not thick so I just wear another sock over them for the cold months.I used the free super saver shipping, and they still arrived with a week."

292839,0,I liked the fact that it was a huge tent with a screen porch area. Though the porch area doesn't have a floor making it easier to track stuff in. The sleeping areas are a bit on the smaller side I think. We have a queen size mattress and it took up one and 1/2 rooms. Took us a while to put up at first. We have only used this tent once and unfortunately by the time we took it out of the box it was way past the exchange time frame and noticed that the 2 back rooms have defective zippers. It took my almost an hour to get the one door shut after use cause you have to do it very very slow and basically start all over if they dont align properly. Though i have been reading a lot about leaking i didn't experience that this trip since we had no rain but will be aware of what may happen. All in all its not too bad of a tent though i think i may look into getting a larger more sturdier tent for my developing family.

468534,0,"Ok. It's my fault. But these manufactures never tell you JUST how much you can safetly wind a crank device. So, I ""pushed"" this lantern a little too much (maybe 10-15 minutes of intermittent cranking), and I 'blew' the circuity."
151117,0,"The AA Mini Mag is a reliable tool for everyday use. Here are the pro's:It's compact size and the sheath allow you to carry it anywhere you go. If you drop it nothing will happen to it (unless of course you abuse it). The lenses scratch easily, but they are inexpensive to replace. The lightbulb is also inexpensive should the original blow out. The head quickly adjusts from spotlight to floodlight, and it's quick conversion to candle mode make it a unique tool, especially during a blackout or natural disaster. Its compact size also allows you to use it in tight spaces such as checking the back of the refrigerator, washing machine, or in your car's engine.The con's:The light is not too bright, it just doesn't hack it if you're picky about illumination. Of course the xenon bulb is better than the type you'll find on a $1 Dorcy light, and many other cheap flashlights. But if you've used Streamlight, Inova, Surefire, or even the new 3-watt LED Maglites, you'll be disappointed by its brightness. If you're willing to spend some bucks, you can upgrade your Mini Mag to a 1 Watt LED light, which will provide twice as much light. You can also buy the switch that allows you to turn it on at the bottom with a simple click. There are some pretty cool things out there that can turn this tough, reliable flashlight into something better! However, it is still not appropriate for law enforcement, military, security guards, etc. It would be more appropriate for everyday household use, walking the dog at night, or lighting up the room your in during a blackout.This flashlight usually ranges between 8-15 bucks depending on where you get it from. If you spend about $25 bucks (which would be roughly the same amount you would spend to upgrade the mini mag), you can buy yourself a 2AA battery, 3-watt Mini-Mag Lite with a holster that will surely not leave you disappointed. It's light output is tremendous, and it is sure to blind you or anyone who looks directly onto it. It also travels further. It also saves battery life. It's not your average LED-light, it's better and at an affordable price. So you might want to give that other flashlight a try if you're picky about the brightness of your flashlights.Hope this helps!"

92331,2,"I have had my Gazelle for over a month now but I was off to a very bad start with it and the company. Assembly was easy and straightforward and of course I wanted to give it a test run after assembly, that's when I noticed that one of the frame cable ends had been crossed threaded and the knob was no where to be found. I immediately called customer service and found out that they were already shut down for the day. So went online and found where I could email them about the problem. Waited for three business days with no response, then wrote again with no response todate. After waitng for over a week with no reply, I decided to fix the problem myself. Six dollars and a half hour later, the machine was back in working order. Used it daily for about a week and a half and started hearing creaking noises from different pivot points and decided to lubricate all pivot points with good lube (it was supposed to be prelubed). Upon disassembly, it looked like quite a few of the pivoting points had never had any lube applied! My recommendation is to lube everything possible during the assembly phase. On the plus side, the machine is like any other piece of exercise equipment, you get out of it what you put into it and you can get a pretty good workout from it if you want to. Word of caution, regardless of how good of shape you think you are in, start slowly and for not too long, you use a lot of muscles you're not used to using. Also the batteries on the timer/recorder only last about a week and a half to two weeks. Because of the initial problems and the lack of product support, I can't rate it very high at all. Makes me think that the company figures that once it's sold it's someone else's problem..."

325637,1,"This is one of the best products I have bought. It is so simple to install, and it is much better than a rear mounted child seat. It has the benefits of you being able to see your child all the time, and able to interact with your child by pointing out things. You can see when they are falling asleep and don't get the fishtail effect of a sleeping child on a rear seat. From a safety perspective, the seat is great, as the child is always enveloped within your arms, so if you have to fall, you will be able to shield the child from the impact. I would recommend this child seat to anyone who want to have a great cycling experience with your child."
238729,2,"I rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike. I also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child's bike straight, but I never recived the part. I am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they didn't help me. I hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs.Thank you"

I searched around to find this bike in stores so I could see its size and weight, but couldn't find it anywhere in my area. My only complaint about the bike is its size and weight. It is bigger than I imagined and very heavy to carry or lift anywhere. I live on a hill and very often have to push or carry the trike up the hill."
430785,0,"I absolutely love this jacket's bright color, light weight, and fluffy down. I bought it when it was snowing outside and it handled the 20 degree snowy weather fantastically. It's lightweight (maybe 2 lbs!) and feels thin so it's not a huge bulky jacket... but it really keeps me warm! I was able to go for a walk in the snow with a t-shirt on underneath and it was nice and toasty... and didn't make me sweaty during the uphill parts.I had to dock it a few stars for 2 big reasons- first, no hood, and second, what the heck is up with the pocket location?? My first instinct when it's cold outside is to stuff my hands in the pockets. There are no pockets for hands on this jacket, only two tiny ones right on top of the boobs (and who puts their car keys and cell phones in pockets like that, am I right?) Totally bummed about that. But everything else about the jacket made it worth the purchase. If you don't care about the hood or the pockets, this jacket is fantastically warm."
136528,0,"It is very okay. It is probably the best cardio you will ever get in your life. However for the first month, the exercises are extremely repetitive. You will not really work your upper body much if getting jacked is what you're looking for. To be honest, I'm a little surprised that there is not a ton of ab work. With that being said, if you want to get in shape and burn some fat/calories, this is a great workout for that. So far, I personally have not seen results worthy of advertisements on the television. However, I have probably trimmed down some, and I know my cardio has improved. In two words, it's ""all right."""
376415,0,"Having looked at this product online, it seemed like the perfect answer for an upcoming trip... After receiving it, it appears as though it will work, but is somewhat smaller than I expected, and perhaps a little bit tippy. I had previously purchased a similar item from a local store, and the seat was spacious and seemed comfortable to sit on. I wanted to get a second one for my husband, but was unable to find another locally, so ordered this one online. Since my husband is quite a bit larger than me, I guess he will be using the one I had before, and I will have to use this one. It will serve the purpose, but not as well as I had hoped for."

Like all polyester/plastic clothing, they seem to reek at the end of the day of normal activity. My standard cotton boxers smell way better after a long day of hiking. Hype sells, but I call bullisht on the odor prevention."
492226,0,"I only used this once on my horse, so I really haven't noticed any difference, hence the neutral, 3-star rating. But I can tell you that it was really greasy upon application and had a strong fake/chemically smokey bacon-ish odor to it. My barn manager actually thought there was a fire burning near the barn due to the odd aroma. I will try it a least one more time on my horse's mane and tail to see if it thickens and lengthens the hairs. If not, the greasiness may make it at least a good conditioner."
55708,1,"A buddy's wife told me she went to the doctor after hurting for years and they told her to get the band it, well at first I laughed and said a dumb band won't work, well little did I know this thing helped out my elbow and forearm pain so much that I only have to wear this from time to time, I reccomend this to everyone for elbow or arm joint pain."
315408,0,Not bad could be better. Sleeves are a bit long. The tie offs are extremely annoying they stick outward vizable to every one. the stomach area is not smooth or tight the uniform bunches. But the quality of the material is very good for the price.
318238,1,"Hoo-Ahhs are an excellent product - good enough for us to include them in our disaster preparedness auto kit (see my blog if interested). The towels are sturdy, don't have a flowery smell, and re-seal in the package. Hoo-Ahhs fits the niche market of those willing to pay a few dollars more for a quality product. My only suggestion to the company is to offer a larger package as well. These packages only have 20 towels.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of ""Process of Elimination"" - an intense thriller that pits a martial artist against a world-class sniper out to shape the presidential election."

Fundamental expectation of shooting glasses (this is a big one): being able to see out of them while shooting a gun.Ventilation or some sort of texture on the frame would undoubtedly help."
241535,0,Nice product. However the S&H costs were high and it took forever to receive shipment.
470066,0,"Although I like many things about the finished product, the instructions are inaccurate and parts do not fit together as well as one would expect for a device at this price. I had to make numerous contacts with Nautilus (the manufacturer of Schwinn) and received well intentioned misinformation and incorrect parts as I tried to correct several lose fittings that were crucial to reasonable performance. At one point I was advised that if I used the machine in reverse, it would void warranty. The instructions specifically said it could be used in reverse. Also, there is a noticeable difference between hand grip and wireless heart rate monitor accuracy. Since the wireless was one of the main features that distinguish this from the less expensive 418, it may be better to consider the 418. I have not given up hope of getting this to work correctly, but it has taken time and effort that I had not bargained for and that is why I gave this an average rating."
29655,1,"I bought this tank to replace two 12oz. ones that have reached the ""need to be hydro-tested"" phase. Not wanting to deal with finding someone around me that can do that (and liking the idea of a little more play time before refills), I picked this tank up. It was packaged with a ton of foam. So, there was no risk at all of it arriving damaged. I've always used Pure Energy tanks, so I had no hesitations trusting this one. Works great for what's asked of it. No complaints what so ever."
342767,1,"I LOVE this product! I got it for my seven year old who moved to coach pitch from t-ball this spring. We had great success with this machine! He is better able to time his swings, and getting more batting practice in which is always good! I love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery when we are at the field I can break it out and not have to worry about an electrical outlet. I would probably buy the one with the remote control next time but this one works great!"
207854,0,"I purchased this for tourist season at the gym, and had no idea what size to get. A little more help with sizing information would be good. I probably should have gotten a long torso size suit, but I have no way of knowing. Three stars for that reason. Otherwise it's fine, good value for the price I guess. It's not like I expected the suit to make me less fat."
61107,2,"I purchased this about a month ago to replace a Walmart brand screen house that got ruined last fall (my fault for not bringing it in before the first snowfall!) Walmart no longer sells a hexagonal screen house of similar size, or I would have bought the exact same model again. As soon as I took the Wenzel out of the box (no nice carry bag like the Walmart one!), I could feel the flimsiness of the poles. Sure enough, while setting it up, one of the pole tips bent. When I called Wenzel, they would not stand behind their product. After it taking about a week to get through to them on the phone, they told me to disassemble the screen house, and mail them the pole back (at my expense), and then they would decide whether it was ""a warranty issue or not"". After telling their clerk how disappointed I was at the lack of product support, I hung up, and I guess I will live with a bent pole. Spend your money elsewhere - Wenzel has cheap, flimsy poles, and no customer product support."
188237,1,"I find it unbelievable that there are people here who couldn't get this thing to make a spark. There's only 2 ways I can think of using this where you wouldn't get a spark:-Taking it out of the box, striking it once, and immediately giving up and posting a negative review because they failed to realize that there is a layer of paint you have to scrape off before it will spark,or-failing to read the 2-sentence instructions printed on the box, AND ignoring the words that are written on the metal striker.This thing is incredibly easy to use. Hold the firesteel in one hand, and scrape the striker away from you with the other hand. Voila! SPARKS! IT doesn't even require any significant amount of strength; I'm confident that a 4-year-old could achieve good results.It ignites any basic tinder that any other spark would ignite: toilet paper, shredded up printer paper, etc.The string that keeps the striker together with the firesteel was plenty long on mine. I know some people had complaints about the length, but I found it to be plenty long. If you want to make it longer, just do what other reviewers pointed out, and cut a piece of parachute cord to whatever length you want."
181294,0,These are not the softer more absorbent type of patch I was expecting. I find I have to double up to get enough friction to clean my M&P 9mm barrel. Otherwise an OK product.
1980,0,"These are great for hiking or anything else active. But do not buy them here, even if you don't pay for shipping they are overpriced here, you can find these $20 or less at a local sporting goods store. Other then that they are a very good product. But only 3 stars because well price matters and I look to amazon for deals or at least competitive pricing."
346431,0,Design is classic and nice. However the quality feels different from the pair I had before. Frame seems lighter compared to the lens.
440577,0,"If you don't know better, these probably seem like an improvement over the cheapest karate scrubs available, but compared to quality middle-weights, these really do seem like cheap lightweights. I wanted to replace some quality middle-weights that use a drawstring with something equivalent with this type of waist band. In that regard, this type of waistband is much more comfortable than a drawstring alone. Another plus is that they have a back pocket. Their saving grace is that they only cost about $20.On the downside, as I alluded to, compared to real, quality middle-weights, these are thin, light and abrasive, being partially synthetic. They're more of a middle-ground between real middle weights and light weights. Additionally, unlike a lot of other quality pants, they lack any fastener for the pocket. So don't put anything in it if you're training (not that you should anyway).It's a ""for the money, they're decent"" thing."
234982,2,"We moved into our new house in March and now 9 months later, I've had to throw the flag out. Initially it looked great and my husband loved it. Yes, it's been left outside and yes we've had a couple nasty wind storms but I expected it to last longer than it did. The edge started to tear about 2 inches from the side. I thought I could sew it but once my husband took it down I realized it wouldn't be possible. I also realized that the S was starting to tear out and there were several other thin/torn spots."
30837,1,My 8 month old son LOVES this ball. He plays with it forever and it has longevity; he will be able to use this toy for a long time because it is durable.
143564,1,Product was as described and found to be easy to use. Timely shipment and in good condition.
70298,0,I bought this to carry keys and cell phone. You can only carry one. It is small If you only want to carry a cell phone it is great. If your wallet is fat it will not fit either.
319762,1,I use this table for craft fairs and it's good product for the money. It folds to a small size and it's light weight. I carry it in one hand with the handle. it's easy to set up and break down. No complains.
66293,1,This shirt looks good and is very confortable to wear. I have several and always get compliments on how they look.
361339,0,"Good Product, Terrible Manual.This manual is pretty bad. They put multiple languages on each page and for each instruction. When of course what they should've done was to have multiple sections for various languages.Even disregarding the above shortcomings the manual is still difficult."
134902,2,This was to be the bed for my 3 1/2 year old grandson. When it was time for him to go to sleep it was almost entirely deflated. It had been blown up a few hours before. We inflated it again and by morning he was on the floor. I would NOT recommend this mattress. It is going back to Amazon.
425280,0,Sock weight is good. Minimal cushioning. The sock would come up above the knee if I pulled it all the way up (I'm 5'10&#34; with a 31&#34; inseam). I need a sock that is about 4&#34; shorter.
445146,1,"I bought this umbrella about a year ago. Is great and here in Florida I get to use it a lot with our liquid sunshine.Size - Its rather large and can fit someone under it nicely. As well as has a nice curve to it. Will keep you dry and can even fit over a stroller to keep a baby dry which I was much appreciative about.Wind - Have not had a chance to see any major winds, but I believe from the wind I have seen the design holds well to never have to worry about the umbrella ever inverting or even try to blow out of your hand. Which I would think is the major reason for this umbrella and its design.Folding - It folds down and pops up pretty nicely. Though it is still kind of like when folded down. Has two Velcro straps that are around the outside to help strap it down. Also has a sleeve but I have stopped bringing the sleeve around with me. Folds open nicely with a touch of a button.Issue:My one issue with this is that the caps which hold the ends of the umbrella to the metal arms kept coming out when I would fold it down. So you click the button to open it up and find that you have to pull down a cap or 3 onto the arm. Rather annoying, especially when raining. I fixed this by getting some crazy glue, putting it inside the plastic cap attached to the umbrella, and then putting the arm end back into the cap piece. Now when it opens up the umbrella always folds out perfectly.Conclusion:The only issue I had is minor and easily fixable. Other than that it is a great umbrella and well worth the money. Will last a long time. I am considering getting more to replace other cheaper ones I have in the car and in my place (nice to have one always with you). Also considering getting their largest size one too."

311638,1,"after a year the prop is doing what I asked - power out of the hole. I have a heavy glass boat - bayliner capri - and with the family in the boat it was difficult to pull a skier out of the water with a Evinrude 115 - now I can quite easily - I give up about 8 mph but I'm still doing 30 to 32 with four people, a dog, and one skiing. Would rather have a 150 engine, but it is what it is."
197588,0,"This would have been a great purchase with the exception that once I got it, I got out the instructions, which seemed easy enough but could not fit the rod into the bottom, no matter what I did. I broke a sweat for 40 minutes before calling customer support. After being on hold for 20 minutes, the woman informed me that there is a known problem with this scooter that there is an incorrect part and that she was going to email me new instructions for putting it together and that it if I could not get the rod in, she'd send me a new rod which did not have the problem. I was astounded that the company would knowingly sell the product with a part that was defective and said so to the representative. She informed me that since the part did not present a safety issue, it was not recalled. She did apologize for the inconvenience. Crazy.Once it was finally put together, I am enjoying it, but I would not ever purchase again."
156178,0,"Overall I would say I am pleased that I purchased this chair. I can tell that I am actively engaging my core a lot more during the day, and when I think about it, my posture is better too. (Don't be fooled, you can slouch in this chair too.) What has shocked me the most is how much my bum hurts sitting on the ball. I guess since they encourage you to get up and stretch or walk around every 60 - 90 minutes it's a good reminder to do so, but wholly crap, this is a bit much! My bottom was really, really hurting after the first day I used the chair, and I was really glad I was only in the office a half day! Be warned, if you are not used to sitting on a ball all day, you will feel it...and not just in your abs like you think!"
301199,0,"It's a very good looking watch and is fine for swimming and diving. Visibility under water is very good. However, my experience over the past month has been that you need to wear it at least every other day or it will stop running. In addition, the casing is very thick (I guess not for a diving watch) and it doesn't fit comfortably under standard shirt sleeves and jackets. As a result I use it mainly for recreation, I don't use it for work."
471553,0,"I bought this watch because it had a lot of features that interested me and because it was on sale at a great price. The added features are nice to have, but I've been very disappointed with the actual heart rate monitor. The resting heart rate seems to be OK, but it is nearly impossible to get an accurate reading while exercising (even walking on the treadmill). Often it fails to register at all, and when it does it's all over the scale. I have to step off the treadmill and be completely still to get an accurate reading.On the positive side, it does have other nice features (recovery rate, splits, calorie counter, etc.), and it's not too big to fit on a small adult wrist.However, would not buy again."
31866,0,"Harbinger is an amazing company for just about anything.This would be my 2nd pair of the same type of glove. The other pair lasted about three years of weight training. This 2nd pair is ok.

265858,0,"I like the dart game itself, however, when we got it and put it up and used it the first time some of the points did not register as being hit by the dart. I am in the process in dealing with the company as to get it repaired or replaced as it is under warrenty for a year. So far I haven't been able to talk to a person directly. Maybe it is due to the holiday season. I have been receiving e-mails from them and had to e-mail a copy of my receipt as to when I purchased it so I can get an RMA number to return the game. Hopefully this will go smoothly and I will either get the game repaired or replaced. The points that did register when hit by the dart worked good, and the reviews about the sound system not being really clear to hear, I agree with. When the announcer says single it sounds like Bingo. I guess I can live with that. Once we get the game working properly I am sure we will like it. It wasn't too bad to install on the wall either. Luckily where we wanted to hang it on the wall, it had a stud there to screw the screws into. I guess I should write another review after this ordeal in getting it fixed. As for purchasing it from Amazon, it came in a timely fashion and I have no complaints about the ordering process."
35520,2,"I specifically ordered this foam roller because the term ""high density"" was in the name and it was 24"", which is the ideal length for a combination of home and travel use. This is NOT a high-density roller. I thought it would be comparable to the black high-density foam rollers (which do not come in 24"" length) that I have used during PT sessions; it is not. It is in fact much softer. Additionally, when I compared it side by side with my old white foam roller, it is actually softer than that one as well. While the density of this roller does not seem to be a problem for others, the term ""high density"" is misleading and if you are looking for a roller that is actually high density, I suggest you stick with one of the black ones."
226318,0,"This does work, but the foot pads do not keep it from sliding unless you put a carpet or some kind of mat under it. It slides all over on lino or wood floors. It also has a glitch which causes jerking unless you go at a fast rate. I would have sent it back if it weren't for postage already paid and what it would cost to send it back. I would just break even with a refund. I will continue to use it; give it a chance to smooth out and always have a mat under it, but as I said, I am glad I got it on sale. I would not consider it worth the usual price."
457253,0,"I just got this watch. It is simple to use and the heart rate monitor works well for me. The altimeter and heart rate monitor was what sold me on it, and the price. I wore the watch for a workout for the first time and decided to wear it in the shower after to see how it held up to the water. An hour later the metal face on the watch fell off on the floor. Wow, first day.My other biggest peev about this watch is that the heart rate monitor is not equipt to show you many statistics about your workout. It shows the highest and lowest heart rate you had during the workout, but not the average, or how long you were in each fitness zone, and no graph display for heart rate. The only way to compare the intensity of one workout to another is through the calorie counter function. And it has no memory for that statistic so you would have to remember how many calories your burned in your last workout in order to compare. Basically it is really best at showing what your heart rate is currently.So basically the watch is pretty cheap and all of the functions work...but its probably not the best watch for any single one of them."
478352,0,"Material is excellent. Since my last purchase of this product, the length has shortened up considerably. Now hard to keep tucked into my jeans. Don't buy if your over 6'. Now made in El Salvador, previously made in Mexico (I think, not sure)."

UA shirt is made of 95% polyester and 5%elastan and NB 100% polyester. I guess it's the elastan that makes so much of a difference. Well done UA! I am purchasing another one of those. Highly recommend it.I am 5'6"", 150lbs, well built and Small fits me just fine. I am glad I did not order Medium. Bear in mind it's LOOSE fit."
282506,0,"the product description says they'll ""clip to just about anything"" but doesn't say the maximum circumfrance, though it's right about them being cute. there's no place on my bike for the red light to go so that people will see me from behind."
63190,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed. Thank you ladies, for your review comments, as I rely on these to make my purchases."
113835,2,"I am very unhappy with the product. It broke the first time I used it. I put it on the car, loaded the bike and then traveled 25 miles. The bike was secure, but that was not the problem. When I got home and started taking the rack off the release on the top strap clamp broke. The only way that I could get it off was to undo all the other straps and then slide the strap off after the others were loose. I am going to contact the company and hopefully they will send me a replacement part. The company promptly sent me a replacement part for the broken clasp. Great service and hopefully this one will not break."
968,0,"Ignoring the countless sexual innuendo jokes to the title of this review, I ordered a 44'' Shinai from this company. Instead, they sent me a 36'', far from the size I ordered. Now the quality of the Shinai is superb, strong, durable, and light (understandable since its a smaller size than I ordered), the only issue is that I was not given what I ordered. I still like the shinai they delivered, but again. Not what I ordered."
351170,0,"When I bought this shirt it seemed pretty sweet, however, after one washing (cold water, delicate dry) it shrank two inches in length in the body and about an inch in the sleeves. Fortunately I bought it for work so it is not that critical, but it is now definitely too short. I would recommend instead the Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Crewneck Sweatshirt. Super sweet and warm, and no shrinking..."
25650,1,"Sorry for the bad pun. I bought this with possible intentions of using it as an every night mattress. I really don't think it's suitable for that due to the fact that you'd need to adjust the air probably at least once a week and the pump that comes with it is very weak. It's powered by D batteries and can't handle high air pressure; the air just leaks back out from the mattress.But for the price, this is really a great deal. The mattress is very sturdy and comfortable. I decided to keep it as a spare bed and use an aero-bed for every night sleeping."
175176,1,"This is an excellent pack for extended backcountry, especially if ya have a lot of gear to pack in. I bit pricey and worthwhile. Not for daytripping though."

485369,0,"I am giving the product a 3. I'm disappointed in them. They are bulky, which is probably typical for this type of weight. The pins snag on my shorts when doing curls next to my body. You can not hold them with two hands so I can't do one of my favorite lifts with them (over the head drop weights to back of neck and up). I put them on a cushioned chair instead of buying the stand and it is hard to change the weights on anything even a little soft. You can't move a weight from the left hand to right hand without sitting it down first. Just little things that I didn't think of. They are nonreturnable."

I wish it had compass function and low temp resistant LCD, but I figured it was still a good deal for the price (paid $34.83)."
470664,0,"The bike is pretty solid we got it quickly, and it was pretty easy to set up.(only took 10 min tops) When I got on it, it was a little shakey which i guess for the price is to be expected. The problem is that there is no way to addjust the resistance. It might be fine if you are looking for a very light work out at home but even for how out of shape I am it was still very easy. the only other thing is I am about 6'3"" and the arm attachments are a little small when I put the seat up to where I feel comfortable.My advice spend the extra money and get something a little nicer."
175894,1,"After reading many of the rave reviews for the Buck 110, I'm not certain that I'm capable of adding too much. I will tell you this: I received my first Buck 110, back in 1965, from my Grandfather. He was a real admirer of Buck's quality, and owned a few for his own personal use. He was a lineman with the local power company, and used his Buck extensively while at work. Apparently he thought his affection for the 110 would be equally as appreciated by his 19 year-old grandson. It wasn't.Somehow I managed to lose my 110 (mainly through disinterest and a casual ""who needs folding knives?"" attitude) some time around late 1968 or early 69. I vaguely remember this because I had returned from Viet Nam in October of 68, and it wasn't too long thereafter that I remembered my Grandfather's gift. I made a half-hearted attempt to locate it, but never was able to find it. My Grandfather finally passed away a few years back, and I must confess that I never told him that I'd lost his gift. Fast forward to today.Today I have another Buck 110 (although I had to pay for this one out of my own pocket), and I can honestly say that I wholeheartedly appreciate the quality my Grandfather so deeply appreciated in his Buck knives. The lockup is tight! I mean TIGHT! And sharp, too! This baby will not only slice paper like it's cutting through air, it will easily make pig-tails of the thinnest cuts. Out of the packaging it shaves arm and leg hair without the slightest problem. The appearance of the Buck 110 is spartan, yet classic at the same time. But don't let that austere look fool you. This knife is a beauty! It's not a ""tactical"" wannabe; it's not an oversized pig-sticker; and it's not a knife to be needlesly pounded on to make kindling out of larger pieces of wood.It is, without reservation, simply the best!"

I would never purchase from this seller!!!!!!!!!!
481396,1,I love it because it does what it's suppose to. The price was right and so was the product. I recommend this to anyone how needs. That's anyone who drives!
462563,0,My hearing is just a little fuzzy. I didn't want to invest a lot just to see if I could tolerate something in my ear. Surprisingly they are okay. I wouldn't say that if they cost as much as some of my old friends claim they paid but okay for this old cheapskate who didn't expect miracles.
401490,1,These are amazing! My workouts are some much better with these! Support galore yet pliant for easy movement! The fabric formula is an Uner Armour exclusive! Yes! It matters. Athletes rejoice in total support! Way recommended!

Since the two bars or tubes are the exact same size, one does NOT fit into the other. They are now just hanging in mid-air.I have contacted the company numerous times. They told me to take a picture and e-mail them a copy of proof of purchase, which I did. They said they were unable to download it...so I sent it to several other people, including myself!, and it downloaded perfectly. So I resent it to them 3 times and have yet to receive any response.

So I thought maybe it would be a similar but knockoff type brand. OMG these leggings are the EXACT same quality as forever21's except the only difference is that these are $30 vs $5... I am returning them, reason being, is that they are see through and not worth the money. I also bought ""capezio"" leggings which I added the link below, and they are a little bit cheaper but more importantly NOT see through.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XZMCQK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00"
239801,1,Great for the price paid. Kid loves this Sqarepants products.
208400,2,"We decided to buy it because it was the most affordable bike carrier on this site but it is not worth the money or the effort setting it up.First of all the so call ""instruction manual"" was simply a few fuzzy pictures along with some short captions instead of detail steps.Second the structure lacks stability and it is out of cheap parts such as: Flimsy plastic straps meant to secure a 50 pound bike, nylon straps that can not prevent a bike from moving out of the holder, plastic holder that will move at sudden movements.And sadly after all this effort of configuring the 2 bike carrier we came to the conclusion that only ONE of our bikes can fit.Despite what the ""instruction manual"" told us the carrier can NOT hold women's bikes or ones that are over the speed bike's category (more than 25 pounds).It is obvious to say that we will be returning this product tomorrow.J&A;."
360927,2,"When you open up the box, you'll find the parts and quantities do not match the quantities indicated on the instruction sheet. The item came with the wrong screws and nuts. In fact, the ""instructions"" come with a few lines after ""step 3"" which instruct you to call the customer service department (number provided) and parts will be sent. When I called, the person said that this is common and that they will send a ""pre-packaged set of parts"" so I can only hope they send the proper screws and nuts.UPDATED - they do send the proper screws in a week or two."
180230,0,I bought two sets of these mask/snorkel combination. Both me and my wife were disappointed with this equipment. The masks were leaking; the snorkels were too short.
86442,0,"Pants are fine. A little snugger than what I'm use to, but then I normally avoid anything with spandex. However, based on the sizing information I could find, it looked like they should have been 5"" to large in the hips. Fit was definitely skin tight."
359178,1,"While I was working in food safety in a processing facility, my entire department used these flashlights for preoperational inspection. At one point, my light fell far enough to actually rupture the batteries inside with no damage to the light, lense or body of the flashlight. We cleaned up the inside, replaced the batteries and it was still in use when I left the company. This is a great product for those in wet environments."
108265,1,"For a parent, especially one who tends to be mechanical challenged at times, the best thing about any toy is ease of assembly. This one would have gotten 5 stars in a minute if some of the screws they used where 1/4"" longer. After much fussin and cussin, I took out a big spring clamp to be my 3rd hand and then I was able to finish assembling the kart.Charging is simple. The kart is well made w/o being too heavy to move around if you need to.They might consider putting a little more substantial seat belt on it. That piece looked like it had about a two year lifetime. My son took a medium corner w/o his belt on and came right off of it. Helmets are always a nice accessory for any riding toy.I wish the flag was about 3 feet taller. You need the visual cue here especially since the kart is rather stealth by dirt bike standards.Great little rider for the sub-teen."
107191,0,"The measurements of this carabiner are not listed in the description, but I took a chance and ordered it anyways. Thought it would be good as a key ring, but it's a little too big for my liking. In case you want to know, it measures 2-7/16 inches long and 1-5/16 inches wide. Otherwise, it's lightweight and seems very sturdy."

She was so excited at the end result, which should have been what we received in the first place as this is what the ad was selling. Pink Tip Ups"
327200,0,was hoping for something a little better like other mesh shirts as the material here is more like polyester or spandex.. but it does the job and fit well.

54755,1,"Great value compared to the more expensive lasers. Comes with a remote pressure switch and seems to be of good quality. It is a little tricky to adjust, but if you patiently and gradually adjust it, it should take 10 rounds or less, or just get a bore laser sight for your caliber weapon and its even easier and you save time and ammo."
327683,0,The size is accurate. I'm more used to the neck hole being wider than this and also the hand openings are a little tight. Other than that it fits fine.
159887,0,"I have used these lures with mixed results. I prefer Panther Martins personally especially their yellow body and blade spinner with red dots. Absolutely deadly. What I hate though is when an Amazon seller lists something at ridiculous prices but marks it down 99% to a realistic price to make themselves look good. Case in point, FishUSA lists this lure that can be bought at any store that sells fishing gear for $519 but then marks it down to $3.95 making it look like it's 99% off! This is a real problem for Amazon and I hope they do something to curb this deceptive practice. I've made a personal resolution not to do business with any Amazon seller employing this ""technique""."

370905,1,"this knife is light and small enough to fit in a ladies bra and go undetected. great for folks who travel, run, go out at night, or whatever and want a little protection on them. just remember to take it out at the airport. :-("
482766,0,"I mainly carry this knife on weekends. It has remained extremely sharp after a fair amount of use. The speed safe mechanism works great and I don't expect to have any issues. The tip is a little thin and could snap off if used improperly, but I don't plan to use it as a screw driver....that's what screw drivers are for.Edit: After using the knife regularly for a for the past month, the thin blade is starting to take a beating. I've been what I would consider overly cautious of how I use it and the blade is starting to show some jaggedness to it. I'm knocking off 2 stars because of the fragility of the blade."
345937,0,The product is reasonably good once you figure out how to install it based on the instructions provided in the Manual. The instructions for installing the Cadence sensor are extremely confusing. The picture is hand drawn and it is very difficult to see how the sensor is mounted. Polar did not take the trouble to have someone install the sensors based on the instrucitons and proof out the installation procedure. If you are trying to check out the installation on a stationary bicycle stand it takes a lot of turns of the crank to register cadence. This could have been mentioned in the installation manual. Polar's website has a fairly good tutorial on the use of the computer. It would have been nice to have a tutorial on the installation with clear pictures.I will have to think twice about buying another Polar product because of their lack of concern for the customer.
16537,2,"I have used this electronic odometer only once, and after I put all the info into the device (26 inches each wheel) it said that I had ridden my bike (a 26 inch hybrid) for almost 11-1/2 miles. So my unit is VERY inaccurate, since I googled the distance and it added to only a little more than 8 miles - 33 percent less. Other thoughts: As I started to put the computer on my bike I saw that the mounting ""hardware"" consists of only several plastic zip ties, as though the manufacturer even concedes that it won't last way too long (or perhaps that the user will upgrade to something better?). Everything else that I have placed on my bike has mounting hardware that's much more permanent instead of these small white zip ties.The cable also just doesn't look very good on a nice ride. It appears cheap. I was also worried about how the small magnet installs on the spokes, by using a screw and its plastic casing which wraps around the spoke. Immediately I could imagine vibrations moving the magnet or making it wiggle free; once this ever gets lost, you can't measure anything.That same afternoon of my first test, I stopped at a Subway for a 6-inch sub. The LCD screen had pretty much turned black from sun exposure, and the heat was focused into the center portion of its screen. After about 10 minutes I started being able to read the numbers again.The concept is nice and the computer scan is a neat feature, but when someone wants to gauge their trip totals accurately, what's the point in having this if you still have to Google your trip to get an accurate distance? Maybe I should just pocket my GPS and let it track my trip instead, or just hop back on the web to add up my trip totals. I wish I could write something more positive."
312402,1,"I have looked at other watches and ordered one Invicta watch the 3095 that looked like this watch. I scratched the crystal within one week. I then set about to find a watch like it and found this watch. This watch far exceeds my expectations. You can actually see the date in the magnifier, has a saphire crystal, even fits my wrist better than the 3095, I also like the skelton back. The hand does sweep in this watch. All in all i would make this purchase the first time."
501619,1,Love these Flip Flops. So comfortable and wear very well. I like the cloth piece that goes between the toes - never hurts.
393658,0,"Very fast shipping. Assembling rower easy and quick (30-45 min).Tried it out immediately and found the highest resistance level was only a decent workout. Of course, that's a problem because there was nothing for me to work up to. Bottomline: resistance levels too easy. Could only get my heartrate up to 135 after 10-15 minutes at highest resistance level. This was surprising because I'm not in very good shape. Decent shape, but not good shape. Therefore, I believe the problem stems from having a strong upper body. I'm 5'9 230lbs and pretty strong upper body wise.The machine works mostly your upper body because the resistance doesn't adjust to difficult enough level to force your body to use the legs more. Anyway, I'm probably not a good test subject for this machine due to my upper body strength....If you are a beginner who is still a bit too heavy to handle the high impact of jogging, then this will probably be a good machine for you; however, I will go back to recumbent bikes, elipticals and treadmills after trying this rower...."
56637,1,"The pants fit well, look decent, are reasonably priced, and are comfortable. I bought the royal blue color because there are so many grey, black, and dark blue options... and this is a bit more bold."
306011,2,"The adjustable part came in handy when I didn't want to carry a 9 inch blade around. However the handle was not sturdy at all, and the case was that of a child's play toy.

170097,0,"I orderd this vest and the one I recieved was not the same color. The one I recieved by BRIGHT royal blue with silver reflective marks on it. When ordering this in such a large size, one does not neccessarily want a BRIGHT color. This was why I had choosen this one. I will most likely be sending it back. It was a gift for my father who works for fish and game and is required to wear a life jacket."
354563,1,"I picked up a pair of these when I was in China, at a Kung Fu school at Wudang Mountain. Many of the students wore these. They were under $5, so I didn't expect much. These are very comfortable and the soles are surprizingly durable. Enough tread walking outdoors, but still smooth enough to do Tai Chi and Kung Fu turns. They've lasted me a year and they're still going strong. The toes are covered with reasonably thick rubber for occasional kicking, but not enough padding for heavy kicking on a bag. The sizes were metric. I got size 42, because 43 was too big for me to wear with no socks. I got the white ones, because that's all the school had and it went with their uniforms. I didn't even know these came in black. If the white ones ever wear out, I'll probably order another pair in black."

51961,0,"This is my 2nd year owning a Campware Tahoe 3-Burner stove. I've got the big cast-iron griddle for it and without this little grease catcher, all the grease just flows down the leg and all over the ground. So it is a fairly essential part of the whole works. Unfortunately, these little cup-holder are made out of material that is barely more than wire and rivits. In fact, it is exactly where the soft metal rods are crushed flat and the rivits pass through (to connedct the ring to the hook) that tends to fail. It was here that failed on my original one. And I'm sorry to say that it was at this place that my replacement failed as I was not-so-carefully taking it out of the package. The stove is great, but this little part seems to be the weak link in the whole setup. I'm likely going to spend some time trying to see if I can fabricate for myself something a little more substantial. in the mean time, I'll make this one work."

242643,0,"This product is given great reviews (by the manufacturer) on Youtube, but the product comes with NO instructions on how to turn the sharpener over on the base (it has two sides) and no basic instructions on how to use it to sharpen knives and other implements. You can of course go on their website and view all kinds of info videos, or call them and they are relatively helpful, but why doesn't the package include the basics, like how to use it to sharpen (they suggest using water with the duosharp on their website, but nothing like that in the package with the duosharp itself). Since it was expensive, I'll keep it and wade through the info on their website, but they could do better IMO with including the basics.Because I still have to learn to use it, I haven't tried sharpening anything with it, so can't review how effective or ineffective the item actually is."
356906,1,"I was originally going to buy a Thomson Elite seat post, but in the end I couldn't justify the expense. I finally ordered the Origin8 after reading lots of positive reviews, and after a few uses I'm impressed with it. At 400 mm in length, it's 100mm longer than my old seat post, and still lighter. It looks and feels very well made, and clamps down on the seat rails very securely. I'm 6'6&#34; and weigh 250 lbs so that's important!"

306104,0,"First off, I am extremely glad I bought this mat. I love the color (got mine in ""jasmine green"" which is really closer to lime), and love the price. However, it doesn't have a great texture to it, and it seems really thin. In poses where my hands are pressed to the mat, I seem to go all the way through (and I'm quite thin). On the plus side, however, this mat is sufficiently long (I'm 5'8"" and had plenty of room).I have no regrets with this purchase, and may even buy a second one. I knew the quality to expect at this price point. Hopefully you'll expect the same."
374574,1,"It is what it is - a hat. New Era caps are high quality, and this one is no exception. Just realize that wool caps will shrink, so buy at least one size larger. When I pulled it out of the box it was too big for my head, but a few minutes in the laundry dryer fitted it just right."
132376,0,"I wanted a simple divers watch and while searching amazon became quite fascinated with automatic self winding watches.After narrowing down my search by color, size, price, strap type etc., it came down to two very similar watches - this Seiko watch and the Orient Men's CEM65004B 'Black Mako' watch (also sold on amazon) which was half the price.I finally settled on the Seiko since its a more known and trusted brand and seemed worth the extra hundred bucks. I bought it well aware that self winding watches have trouble keeping accurate time.But I was quite shocked after having this watch for a month or so and noticing that the watch is gaining about 5 minutes every week. I don't know if thats the average, but it feels like a lot and I now have to set the time back ever so often. I'm even considering returning the watch.The watch is great otherwise. It looks nice (simple and uncluttered) and works as described. I'm particularly happy with its glow in the dark capabilities. Even after several hours of darkness it retains its brightness unlike a cheaper casio I previously had which would go dark in an hour. The movement of the rotating bezel is smooth and firm.Love it, but I wish it didn't gain so much of time or came with a way to caliberate it."
230094,0,"This monitor DOES indeed do what the manual says it will do. That is, it monitors heart rate and provides ""training effect"" information. However, I note 3 problems w/ it that cause me to recommend my previous brand - Polar- over the Suunto. First, because the monitor is not the least bit intuitive in its operation, the manual needs to be much more detailed. I'm pretty saavy w/ monitors and can program most w/o even consulting the manual. I can't even operate this one w/o continual reference to the manual. I end up delaying my training by 5 minutes or more just to get the monitor ready to go. Second, the monitor loses the heart rate signal more than any other monitor I've ever owned. I've replaced the batteries and still, it cuts in and out both inside and outside. Since the monitor is supposed to track your training via heart rate and time in various training zones, this interruption is frustrating and undercuts the whole point of this monitor. Lastly, the monitor is capable of interfacing with various add-ons such as a ""foot pod"" and a ""bike pod."" That's fine if one wants to purchase and utilize those add-ons. But, the menu on the monitor should permit you to delete those fields for which you have NOT added the extra apparatus so that when you scroll through you don't have to click past 3 blank fields for which you have no use. A minor point, I know, but it contributes to an already cluttered menu arrangement."

49078,0,"The backpack has lots of space to carry all the necessary items for a longer hike on the Appalachian Trail, which amounted to about 45 pounds.However, the weight caused the straps , especially around the waist and shoulder, to slide out of position, which made me constantly retension the straps....kind of annoying.....Luckily I had some duct tape with me(don't leave home without it), helping to temporarily solve the problem...I would strongly advise the manufacturer to improve/solve the overall strap problem."

34190,0,"We used this on our dog, who had a really nasty abscess on his neck. I'm a RN so I'm well versed in wound care and figured I could translate that to taking care of our dog's wound. We did have it lanced at the vet and he was on antibiotics for a week, so I ordered this just as a supplement to help with healing because we didn't have the money to have the abcess surgically removed just yet. Despite daily dressing changes with irrigation, packing with sterile gauze soaked in this, his abcess just got progressively worse. We had to have it removed before we were financially able to afford it because it had gotten so bad.I was hoping this would have helped it to heal up, but who knows, maybe the abcess was just too deep for this to do the trick. We still have about 75% of the tub left so maybe I'll give it another chance when the need arises since so many others swear by it."

129143,1,"If you have worked on marine electrics, you have cut and stripped a wire to find that it had water intrusion which corroded the copper strands. It is impossible to solder and you would be irresponsible to attach a crimp connector to corroded wire, due to voltage drop and resistance heating.Every strand of Ancor wire is tin plated to reduce corrosion. It solders beautifully, bends easily, and has a rugged sheath. It is expensive, but cheaper than ripping out yards of corroded plain copper wire every couple of years."
76235,0,"I bought this three day Molle pack with the intetntion of using for day to day carrying of personal effects, etc. Lately I have been working as a handyman and the bag works well for carrying light tools, my lunch, an extra hoodie and whatnot. The pockets are spacious although they look small. You can fit alot more in the pack than you think. Water bladder pocket, too. My only real complaints are that the cord hanging from each zipper pulls right off with little resistance, and the interior pockets have pretty much fallen apart (I rarely used them anyway). If you are planning on buying this pack to augment an actual soldiers' kit... well I would say no way. If you want something that is going to last through a deployment or even Field Training, save up some cash and get Maxpedition, Blackhawk, or Voodoo Tactical. This bag is okay, but not tough enough for actual military use."

397308,0,"I bought this computer at my local bike shop as I wanted one that measured cadence and could attach to the rear wheel to use with an indoor trainer (Cycle Ops Fluid 2). The setup was a bit challenging for me, but it always takes me twice as long to put things together. I had it on my bike and working in around 45 minutes. I think the attachment hardware could be designed better. The numbers are a bit too small to see easily with my 43 year old eyes. It does function well and is simple to reset and gives me all the numbers I need: speed, top speed, average speed, time of ride, cadence, and odometer. I think it is a bit overpriced. Overall I like it despite these minor issues. The bike shop staff told me that wireless units don't have the range to attch to the rear wheel, so thats why I bought the wired version."

455087,0,"Why pay $50, $60 or over $100 dollars for a heart rate monitor? I have to say most of the extra features on more expensive models such as "" fat loss calculator "" are inaccurate and use very outdated formulas that are laughable and flat out inaccurate, Knowing these facts I decided I would go for a model that just measures my heart rate, that's all I need and for some reason I had a hard time finding just that until I ran into the Omron HR-100C.I don't usually go to the gym when its crowded, so I had no problems with electronic interference , but I can notice that when someone happens to jump on the cycle or treadmill next to me, his machine is reading my heart rate too, I'm sure if someone wearing another heart rate monitor comes next to me I wouldn't like this model so much. I guess I just have to keep reminding myself "" hey its less than $40 ;-)"""

142141,0,"Great quality of suit, flattering design, but runs EXTREMELY small. I didn't realize this when I ordered it, so I ordered the size I normally do in TYR, which typically run a bit small... When I put this suit on I had a heck of a time getting it over my hips, it was SO tight. I was extremely embarrassed that my hips were so squashed in the suit and ran to the pool to start swimming right away. I hope that it will stretch a little with wear. Just be aware of this... I think the tiny model in the picture might fit into a 34 (size I ordered, but needless to say, I am not a pre-pubescent model)"
70618,0,"I'm giving this product 3-stars because it's just what it says it is in the description, however if you expect it to be sufficient for 2 people over 3 days you'll be hungry and possibly wishing you had some stuff that's not here....allow me to elaborate...you get 2 2400 calorie food packs, 1 per person. This gives each person 800 calories a day. This may be enough to keep a person alive if they're not moving, but in an emergency situation you may need to be mobile and this isn't nearly enough calories per person per day if you're exerting energy. A 2000 calorie/day diet is a fairly standard benchmark. Understanding that in an emergency situation you have to sacrifice a little, let's say for this packaging a 1200 calorie/day diet. this means you have 2 days of food per person now.The water supply is similarly in short supply for 2 people to make it 3 days.also, as has already been said, the first-aid kit is a bare-essentials kit. you get more aspirin and sinus pills than real ""medical"" supplies like gauze and neosporin.So that's the down-sides, but i read the description and knew all of this going into the purchase, but i bought it anyway... here's why, maybe others can think of this kit the same way and make the most of it.If you're looking for a kit for 2, that means 2 packs most likely. In general let's say we have 1 male and 1 female.This is the ideal ""here honey, put this on your back"" kit. While you (as the man) puts your ""FULL"" kit on your own back.I bought this kit for her, and made my own kit for me. My kit also has 3-4 days of food and water for 2 people (more realistic supplies of a 2-person 3-day supply of food and water too) and all the other essentials this kit is missing like a better first-aid kit, knives, an e-tool, rope, gloves, ammo, etc/etc/etc....between the 2 of us and our 2 packs we'll have more than enough for 2 people to get by for 5 days or so on our own and be well prepared. this kit is definitely the lighter-weight of the 2, and is well-suited as an supplement to my kit and perfect for ""her"".IN A NUTSHELL:If you're looking for 1 backpack to sustain 2 people over 3 days, and have everything you might need, this isn't going to do it.If you're looking for 1 backpack to act as a ""supplement"" to a 2nd backpack, this kit is a great starter and supplement kit, and light-weight enough for your most petite wife to strap on her back as you run out the door with the more complete and heavier kit on your own back. Just buy some more food and water for your own pack as well."
23048,0,"I have had more than one brand of these and they all seem to last on or two seasons. This one is by far the least expensive and it lasts about the same. For $20.00 it can easily be replace every other season. If you only use them a few times a year it would last five or six years. We use ours at the fire pit in our back yard as well as camping. This is a light duty grill. If the Grill itself wears out before the legs do, replace it with a webber coal grill it will last 10 years."

21792,2,"I didn't buy this from Amazon but I do not recommend it at all and I always try to make my reviews of products as honest as possible. I've been working out a lot in the past few months. Two to three hours of walking mixed with running, pumping iron and been doin normal crunches from the floor using my couch for a couple weeks now. After doing 30 fast situps from the floor I begin to feel a serious burn in my abs which is what interested me into looking into this product in the first place. With this Ab Lounge sport it always feels like you're about to feel the burn but never gets you there. It just doesn't do it for me. I went 15 minutes and still didn't feel no serious burn. I quickly took it apart and stuffed it all back in the box because I can tell this thing will do nothing for me. At most it might tone up my already built abs but it will not build that is for sure. I recommend just sticking with normal situps using the floor and couch or whatever you got that can hold you down. After my experience with this machine I will never buy any ab machine again. Hope this review helps....oh and it's a real pain in the butt to assemble. The inside of the box I sent back is a complete disaster lol but oh well."
87089,0,"Pants are fine. A little snugger than what I'm use to, but then I normally avoid anything with spandex. However, based on the sizing information I could find, it looked like they should have been 5"" to large in the hips. Fit was definitely skin tight."
59358,1,"This is a nice addition to my medium Bugaboo set. It packs well with it and looks to have a good non stick surface. I haven't had it long enough to speak to durability. It is more appropriate in size for my cooking needs, than the size that came with my set."
214300,1,"After much research I bought this Needak Half_Fold Rebounder for my sweetie as a Mother's Day Present. Everything about this unit reeks of quality. My sweetie is only 140 lbs. I'm 220 lbs. She loves it, uses it a lot. Me? To confess: I get on it rarely - have tried it a few times - but I can tell you that when I jump on it, this rebounder does not exhibit any stress/ wobbling / walking. The springs appear to be very well made. I have never felt my toes bottom out on the back deck. The ability to fold it in half is cool. The top cover is very well made out of some kind of quality heavy cordura material. The outer column is water resistant. In short, yes this thing is pricey but it's worth it if if you can swing the extra cost. Best wishes."
66309,1,"The fit for XXL is perfect, cool in the heat and a great cover for fishing.Pack and go is what this shirt is made for, I have two of these and love them both."
256573,2,Well made of quality material. Too bad the design does not allow for more of a universal fit. Two reinforcement bars are positioned about 1 or 2 mm too far apart and will not allow the bolts from the pads to pass through and maintain proper alignment. This forced me to explore other options and the local hardware store came up with some plumbing fixture that work great!
342597,2,"They don't hold a charge. Switches break. The new version with different style case and labelled ""China"" are worthless. I've happily used several of the old version daily for 5 years, but the new ones I've bought are poor quality, and I will no longer buy Dorcy."
277366,0,"Product is a good concept, however it is very difficult to get the chain to stay tight, and when the chain loosens, the ring around the leg eventually slides off leaving it useless. I fixed the problem somewhat by putting a bolt through the leg just below the ring. It still loosens a little bit but it serves it's purpose by keeping the legs close to the ground."
298729,0,"Everyone's anatomy is different - I am male, 5'9"" and 173 lbs - so your experience may be different than mine. I have tested 6 different saddles between my road bike and a ProForm 290 SPX Indoor Cycle Trainer I use on rainy days. The six saddles were: 1) Serfas Performance RX (very good for a road bike - its on mine), 2) Serfas E-Gel Hybrid Bicycle Saddle With Cut Out (by far, the worst and least comfortable - see my review on this item), 3)Selle Royal Lookin Moderate Cool Xsenium Bi-Color Actex Bicycle Saddle (2nd worse due to pressure to the perineum area), 4)the stock seat that came on the ProForm 290 SPX (uncomfortable for long rides, but better than #2 and #3 above), 5) Velo Elastomer Bicycle Saddle (this saddle is extremely comfortable AND it happens to be the least expensive - its the one I chose for the ProForm 290), and the 6) Sunlite Cloud-9 Bicycle Suspension Comfort Saddle (better than #2,#3,#4, but uncomfortable compared to the Velo Elastomer saddle).When I received the Sunlite Cloud-9 saddle, I expected it would be the most comfortable saddle based on how it felt when pressed or squeezed. However, upon riding it, I found it harder than the Velo. It lacked enough support on the sit bones while creating more pressure on the perineum area. This may be a result of the downward slanted sit bone pads, which leaves the center of the seat as the highest point. Also, the double stitched seam that goes around the seat between the different colored areas is very rough. It tends to catch on your shorts and creates some chafing between the legs.Overall, it is an ok saddle, but I found the Velo Elastomer saddle to be much more comfortable."

402533,1,"I own a wally world version of this with the cordura nylon sheath. The only difference is it has a walmart sku and comes with the nylon sheath. I bought it on clearance for $30 and figured I couldnt go wrong since I was just going to throw it in my Jeep for emergencies. I was right, this is just as nice as my Kabars SOGS and my $150- $200 TOPS knives. I own a lot of blades from many differnent manufacturers.. Im kind of a knife nut. Its a perfect camp knife for cutting veggies and meat. It will skin a deer if need be.. Its a lot like a USMC Kabar, it and the Buck 119 are my two all around favorite knives. Its not the best most expensive knife you can buy but bygod it will do almost any chore you should be doing with a knife better than most do.. The Sheath is fine other than being noisy. Its cordura with a plastic liner. If I was gonna hunt with it id buy the leather sheath because its quieter. I will give this my seal of approval.. You can spend a whole lot more money on some other brands and not get as good of a outdoor knife as the classic Buck 119 Special.."

I work out 5 days a week and I rotate 3 pair of Harbinger 1250's so I never use one pair more than twice a week. Years ago a pair would last several months with minimal wear, now within 1 month the leather wears down to the point that the barbells actually slip from the glove, this has been happening for a good year and never happened previously. Most likely they are using a lower grade of leather. Insterad of buying a new pair every 6 months it's now every 3. But my options are limited...."
44894,1,"I like the knife, but it's not a pocket knife. Solid construction, good feel and everything I've come to expect from Victorinox.

The one handed operation is a bit rough and would be really difficult if I had smaller hands."

477767,0,"This purchase was the first major screw up that has happened to me while using Amazon.com.I ordered heat shrink tubing but I received an inflatable boat fender instead.I know it sounds crazy but it is true.The UPS man had to use a dolly to bring it to my door. All the time I am looking at this giant box I am saying, ""What in the world could this be?""It was so crazy and funny that there was no way that I was going to send it back.Since I do not have a boat or a friend with a boat I have no practical use for the item except as a conversation piece.So a week or two after my experience I see someone making the news where they received an assault rifle after ordering a computer monitor.Anyway... It was worth a laugh or twelve."
313837,0,"I ordered two of these bottles. I took the first one from the package and went to the sink to fill it to test it out--imagine my surprise when it didn't fill up! I thought there was maybe something else to remove, other than the cap, but it turns out there was a giant hole in the bottom. The seal between the side and the bottom piece was not complete--likely just an aberration in the manufacturing process, but still a pain to have to send back for an exchange. I would make the comment that, once the hole was started, it ripped open larger very easily but that is probably moot--any size hole in a water bottle is a game breaker, so that didn't concern me.The second one from my initial order worked out just fine (as did the replacement from Amazon). I would have to echo some other reviewers' comments, however. I haven't had a problem with the cap, but it IS certainly flimsy and I am concerned about longevity of use. Additionally, the bottle itself is difficult to use with one hand, as it's a little less structured than I would have thought.All in all, there's a reason why they don't make a 1 liter Capri Sun pouch. That much liquid weight is unwieldy in a near-structure-less container and I wouldn't expect this to go anywhere or do anything a Capri Sun couldn't. In fact, the added weight from higher capacity seems to add to its fragility.I was hoping to lighten up my hiking/backpacking load as much as possible with a couple of these, but the risk of water leaking over all my gear isn't worth it. With some of the nice, lightweight Nalgene (and other) bottles out there, these Platypus bottles save you bulk when empty, but otherwise very little weight when comparing the perceived benefits/risks."
484422,0,nothing great but nothing terrible either.. Has this sticky coating on the target to catch the bb's.. I can see the sticky film not lasting long but would like to save as many bb's as I can..So it's fine and does catch bb's but not 100% of the time..

274245,1,"I got this bike for my son for his 2nd birthday. Despite the other reviews, we like the bike. We had it installed at the store for $10. and that was worth it. The parent steering works fine, even though it is a little loose. My son doesn't know how to pedal yet, but he likes to put his feet on the petals, which doesn't stop the wheel like a traditional tricycle would. My son also likes to push the bike himself with the handle. It is worth the money."

350385,0,"I received this watch recently as a gift. It has cool features and operates easily, but I'm not sure if I can get over the size. The watch itself is large which I can deal with, but the band is definitely MAN-sized. The resin material doesn't breath, so even in the mild temps we've been having (50's ~ 60's), my wrist has been sweating. I like the watch really well -- I'm going to see if its possible to replace the band."
471128,0,"This product does work in situations when you have no cloth in between your legs...so at the beach, or with loose fitting clothing. It does not really help when you have cloth in between, such as under armor or something of that sort....so know what you are getting it for..."
86967,0,"Arrived in good condition. Unpackaged easily. There was NO MANUAL in the box, which is ok for me as I'm a seasoned bicyclist. Minimal assembly. I really dig the cast magnesium alloy frame but the rest of the bike feels a bit cheap. The brake levers feel flimsy, the pulls are metal but the rest is plastic. I would expect them to break at some point with regular use. While the photo does not show it (I will try to post some customer images later), the bike I received included mudflaps/fenders. I had to adjust the front brake spring rebound as it tended to remain rubbing against the wheel on one side after releasing the brake. The V brakes themselves also are a bit on the cheap side.As far as size, I am 5'11"" and 165lbs. The bike feels a bit small for me, not unbearably so for short rides, but I would say if you're around my height, you probably want to buy a folding bike with 20"" tires. With the handle bars extended most of the way up, the steering is sketchy and there is some flex in the bars.Now allow me to contrast this bike with the 2003 Dahon Boardwalk folding bike that I own, which has 20"" tires but was twice the price when new. Dahon is the market leader in folding bikes. The Dahon I own feels more solid, fits me better, and is made with higher quality components. Also, the one thing I didn't notice immediately, is that with a 16"" tire bicycle, they have to make the cranks (the arm the pedal attaches to) shorter due to ground clearance. This means that your legs spin faster. The folding pedals (which must be folded out manually and locked into place with a little clip) can only be used on one side, the other side is not flat. This is fairly annoying and I'll likely replace the pedals with a set from Dahon which are spring loaded and both sides of the pedal are flat.In conclusion, I'll probably stick with my Dahon for non-size critical travel applications (car, train, bus, etc). However, when it comes to flying with a bicycle, the Kent packages into an ordinary suitcase much easier that my Dahon would.So is this bike a bargain for the price? I personally would say no. With regular use you'll probably need to replace some parts sooner than later (brake pulls) which will put you near $200 in the end. For a similar price you can find a used Dahon that is constructed better, has as many as 8 speeds, 20"" tires and is overall, a higher quality folding bicycle."
159743,0,I agree with the other review about the reservoir. Both the connection to the hose and the seal around the opening are poor. I replaced my reservoir with one by camelbak. The bag itself is great. Took it to burning man last year and it worked perfectly. If you're going to get this bag be prepared to buy a new reservoir.

443837,0,"When I first started using these I thought they were great. Most of the time I used them for cold water and they seemed fine, but when I tried iced tea or coffee it illustrated a problem. The bottle is designed with internal dimples that make it difficult to clean thoroughly and the color from the coffee or tea illustrated very clearly what was getting left behind when I tried to clean them. I think the manufacturer needs to redesign with a smooth interior to make thorough cleaning easier. I didn't have any problem with funny tastes until after I had been using these bottles for three months or longer. Maybe I needed to clean them better, and a little soap with very hot water and a scrub brush helped, but it is very difficult to get into the dimples even with a good bottle brush.PROS: very effective insulation, lightweight & squeezable bottleCONS: internal dimples make it difficult to clean: may develop funny tastes or stains (depending on contents) that may be difficult to completely eliminate due to the dimples.I have switched to Klean Kanteen bottles (stainless steel). That's not an option if you want a squeeze bottle, but I like knowing the inside is easy to thoroughly clean."

I'm afraid to tighten too much for fear of stripping the wood. One leg keeps twisting, we will have to make repairs or modifications to it to make it stay in place. The base of the legs aren't wide enough or something because it will tip over if my daughter leans into her stretches very much. I would not recommend this item for a serious ballerina."

49278,0,"Like another reviewer here I found out that the stand for this fuel canister breaks far too easily. First, the good news:- Fits almost all types of isobutane canisters used for backpack style camping.- Folds up as compactly as you could wish, to almost nothing.- Adds much needed stability when items are on the stove.- Non-skid feet work very well and the stove stays put.Now the not so good:- When it is cold, it breaks quite easily.- Does not solve the stability problem completely, just helps a lot. The stove can still fall.Fortunately, it's so cheap I'm going to order two replacements right now, just to be sure."
171024,2,"We were so disappointed, and after purchasing, read many reviews that stated the same problems. The tent itself it great, and we are still using it because my husband jerry-rigged the broken poles, but it is not easy to put up anymore. We bought it a few years ago for our new granddaughter to sleep in at grandma's house, and the little sleeping bag that came with it was just the right size. It was small enough for our small living room, and easy to put up/take down in the beginning. For the price, we were very happy, but then about 6 months later (mind you, we only used it about once a month), the fiberglass poles started splitting. we have used electrical tape to fix them, but they do not hold. We ended up repairing it (imperfectly) with some old tend poles we had. I searched everywhere for replacement poles, which I happily would have purchased, but I was unable to find any. We are still using this product which not longer stands up straight, but would pay a little more in the future for something that would last longer."

However, the rest is worse.Pros:- Day/Date/Stop Watch functions are big enough to see- Glow in the dark hands don't require you to press the light at night- Resin band doesn't absorb any water; so you can wipe it off and it's not soggy for hoursCons:- ""Skeleton"" hands hard to see against the black face at a glance (my last watch had a white face - much better)- Watch way too thick - I work with my hands and like something thinner so it doesn't get caught in things as easily- When you do want to use the light, it's pretty lameOverall an OK watch, but there are better options out there"

However the compact lantern makes a great emergency light if you get lost and need to be seen in the dark. Pairing with a flashlight, the micropacker lantern becomes a winner but not too great if its used solo."

I did not want to pay for a leather ball because I am not an avid player, but it seems that leather is the only type for a comfortable hit. I do realize volleyball isn't a pain free sport, but I have played with balls that are much better. In a nut shell, the outside material of this ball is soft, but that does not mean little sting."
292837,1,"We really like the tent. It took us two hours to put up the first time, but we are hoping that now that we can envision it off the ground it will go smoother the next time. We are total beginners and I think this may be ""too much tent"" for us, but that isn't this tents fault. I think it will serve our family of five nicely if we can streamline the process. We are buying a tote to put it in also, because it is not easy to put it back in its bag. I would recommend this tent to someone who needs the space."

348287,1,"Very cool product and a must for kids with ear tubes who love water. Nice and light (I was a little nervous it would be too thick and heavy feeling). BUT BEWARE: the sizing guide is off. My daughter has a 19"" head, and since that's right in the middle of the medium range (17-21""), we figured that was safe. Nope. We have to synch it ALL the way...so that just the tiniest bit of velcro is holding it shut and a long piece is left flapping off the back...and even then it's not quite snug enough. To put it in further perspective, a medium fits ME with room to spare (my head measure 22.5""). We will definitely be exchanging it for a small..."
51681,0,"Buying racquetballs is confusing, even for someone like me who plays regularly and has used all of the different colors at one point or another. Someone should create an in-depth, brand-by-brand guide, but for now I offer you a brief tutorial on the different colors and their standard uses.BLUE - For amateur or recreational players - These are the cheapest and most commonly used ball and can be found in Wal-Mart or any sporting goods store. They work fine but tend to break more easily than others and tend lose their bounce faster than others.RED - The fastest option - A lot of people who I play with prefer the red ball, the fastest ball on the market, and I didn't realize until doing a little research that the red ball is actually intended as an outdoor ball since that extra liveliness is needed on an outdoor court. With a fresh red ball, it can feel like you are playing with a rubber bouncy ball, which can be both fun and frustrating. The nice thing is that even after many plays the ball still has decent bounce, so it may be the longest-lasting option. This ball favors those with a power game. This ball is not available at all sporting goods stores so you may want to buy it online.PINK - Basically the same as red, but probably easier to see - Of the serious racquetball players I know, the pink ball is probably their favorite, and not just because it appeals to their feminine side. I think the primary reason is that it is as lively as the red balls but probably a little easier to see (red can be hard to see because red, white, and brown all blur together at high speeds). I may be misjudging since I've only used it a couple of times, but the pink ball also seems slightly thicker and sturdier than the red ball.PURPLE - Another fast option; most common ball on pro tours - This is the fastest ball that is expressly designed for indoor play (unlike the red or pink balls). It's probably the most commonly used ball on pro tours as it is the official ball of the IRT. However, with this ball you should be careful that it says ""HD"" in the name because I'm pretty sure there are some balls that should be in the blue category but just happen to be colored purple.GREEN - A fast-ish, sturdy option - This might be the second-most commonly used ball behind blues and can be found at many sporting goods stores (but not at Wal-Mart, most likely). It's not as fast as the purple or red but faster than the blue, so is a nice in-between ball. I've also found that it tends to be a fairly sturdy ball, resistant to breaks. On the downside, some people seem to have trouble seeing the green ball (especially if they are colorblind).BLACK - Slowest ball, for ralliers - Technically, the black ball is designed to be the slowest to allow for the longest rallies, so it may be the ball preferred by people who can't move as swiftly or who have more of a finesse game. But it gets confusing, because I've played with two different brands of black balls, one that was the worst I have ever played with (called Slazenger Black) because it felt like I was playing squash -- the ball wasn't just slow, it didn't bounce! -- and the other brand I played with (don't know what it was; maybe Ektelon) felt near-perfect because it was slightly heavier than the typical ball but still had good bounce, so it was easy to anticipate while also bouncing at reasonable height. If I can figure out what that brand was, I will update this post.---Bottom line: I suggest the pink ball if you are looking for a lively ball and short rallies, the black ball (but not the Slazenger!) if you are looking for a slow ball and long rallies, or the green ball if you are looking for something in between. The blue ball is also fine if you're just looking for something basic and cheap.Prices will typically be cheaper (probably 15-35% cheaper) if you buy them in-store, but a lot of stores don't have a great selection or don't allow you to buy in bulk, so there are benefits to buying online, too. I'd suggest checking out a price search engine like Google Shopping before buying online."
54121,2,"Item received was not as described on Amazon. Amazon listing said ""Lures - 1/12 oz - 3/4 oz."" The picture showed about 8 Lures with a cost of $47.00, which had been reduced to $2.95. I placed the order and a 5 days later received only 1 single Lure. This Lure I could have bought at Walmart for about $2.00. I called the company and they blamed Amazon for making a mistake on the listing, but they have done nothing to correct it. I am unhappy and very disappointed with this company."

Very plush, soft, comfortable and warm, and the v-neck gives them a touch of class. The neck of one of the shirts seems to be stitched differently than the others, and it's a little tighter around the neck, but it's not a serious concern. Despite being warm the shirts aren't especially thick as others have mentioned. I was concerned about how they'd hold up in the laundry, but I've washed them at least six times apiece and they seem to be doing well. Plus they come out of the washer spun nearly dry and they absolutely refuse to wrinkle -- a bachelor's dream! Highly recommended."

25697,0,"This Pickup is ""okay."" To me, okay is it picks up the balls easily as advertised, does what is supposed to do. However it needs to have some improvements. For example, It does not always stand sometimes it drops down onto the floor and the balls roll away. Its height is not good for a tall person like me. I need to bend down to get the balls consuming more time. I would recommend this product to people who are not tall and can deal with balls rolling away at some points."
362422,1,"This is I have to say, a fantastic product if you are in to grip strength training. Because of the fantastic design of this gripper, the incriments of tension are anything between 0.5 and 9 lbs when changing the position of the springs. You actually over time make fantastic strength gains without realising it! With the more well known Torsion spring grippers like ironminds, you are very aware of the tension differences between models. I have had this gripper for just under a month and have increased the grip strength of both my hands by roughly 12kg/26lbs (I am now closing the coc 2 for reps for the first time) I hope to be making massive strides in my hand strength over the next year as a result of this fantastic product. If you want to make easier gains in your own grip strength, I really would suggest this product.Also, there is another model similar to the ivanko called the Vise gripper that has knurled handles similar to the ironmind grippers that some prefer."

There are some squats but you can determine how deep or if you are going to do them at all. I use a broomstick instead of a sword. Make sure you clear enough space not to hit your walls or furniture.

37352,1,"This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear. Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts. When zipped, it's just right for those 45-50 degree days (as long as you're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store, or short walks). It's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs. My only disappointment is the main zipper. Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started, and it often sticks mid-zip (as if there was grit or something in it). It always ends up working, but not always smoothly. I'd definitely recommend the vest, and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw, but rather a production glitch, which would not likely affect other buyers."

Upon receiving my credit card statement, I noted that Eastbay retained an additional $6.50 for a ""restocking fee."" So, I ended up spending $15.48 for two pairs of shorts that I did not indeed keep. Hmmm, so much for a great deal at a mere $9.99 each! That will be an end to my online shopping through Amazon or Eastbay for apparel."

329591,0,"I purchased the Horizon Fitness EX22 in December of 2006 from Amazon and used it regularly for the first year (perhaps 2-3 times per week) and less frequently after that.Recently on a renewed exercise kick I decided to use it again more consistently, however the screen displayed the error code ""EP 101"".I called the company and inquired about the error and was told that it needed a new motherboard. He quoted me ~$250 for the replacement which was more than I paid for the unit new.With it being more or less useless I decided to take it apart to see if there was anything that could be done short of replacing the part.I was surprised to find out how the braking system worked. The description called it magnetic resistance which is true, but I assumed it would be electronically controlled (as in electromagnets) instead it's a standard magnet move closer to the fly wheel by a cable (similar to the cables used on bikes). So I plan to just run a gear shifting cable to the break and set the resistance with that mounted near the hand grip.I give it 3 stars because I did like the product before it broke, physically it's well built and sturdy, and quiet during use. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that my main board failure was a fluke and not the norm."

I received them in a heather grey colour, even though the packaging still says ""Oxford"". So BEWARE! I don't know if it is a photo error or a packaging error; either way, not worth the postage to return it2. they are small but NOT THAT SMALL! I read the reviews extensively before finally buying them. Previously, someone reviewed saying that she's an S-M and a XL would fit perfectly - which is what I bought. But both pairs arrived amazingly big. I think my boyfriend can wear them! I folded the waistband (note: elastic band, not strings) down twice and the shorts are still too long and too baggy and make my butt look 50% bigger. I'm a size 4 or 6 (ie S or M), and if I were to buy again, I would get size M, or at most L. So be careful when you up the sizes!Unfortunately these were not a good buy for me.

269749,0,"This bike was delivered and this morning I finished putting it together. My 3 star rating is a combination of it being an ok ride, the condition in which it arrived, the unadvertised color, and the difficulties with putting it together.I have tried it out and it is a decent ride, although the change in tension between the first and second rungs is a bit much. The delivery was unbelievably fast, particularly for the free super shipping. The bike is NOT the color shown. One of the reasons I went with Amazon was because of the blue, as opposed to the orange at other stores. It arrived orange. Silly detail to some, perhaps, but worth noting. It also arrived a bit dinged up, which is disappointing, but I can live with that. What I suspect, after putting it together, is that someone might have given up and returned it (That, and the box looked repackaged. I could be wrong, though). While assembling, there were a few sticking points when I almost gave up, as well. Perhaps this will help those of you out who are going to order one.1. Be patient. The connecting of the tension cable was very hard, but then I walked away, came back and it suddenly snapped into place. I was within one try of giving up.2. Have a wrench handy. Things were going fairly smoothly after the fight with the tension cable until the seat. That required the extra tool, as did the right pedal.3. The right pedal gave me a fight. It's a bit scratched up now because the only way I could get it in place was with a wrench and a lot of exertion. My guess is that if this bike had been returned, that might have been the point when the person gave up.The diagram is simple and all the parts were included. Just be prepared to put anywhere from 45 min to an hour into putting it together in the event that you run into the same problems. Make sure every part is included before starting and have a wrench handy before starting. The little one they provide will only help you with some of the parts."

I have to bike with my knees sticking out & it is not comfortable for long rides. Also, my daughter's helmet hits me right in the chest while I'm biking (she's only 11 months). I fear that as she grows, we will need to get a different seat or a trailer. I am 5'6"", so maybe it would be okay for someone taller or for men. For women my size or smaller, I would not recommend. I wish I would have considered these things before purchasing. If I could make the choice again, I would have gotten a regular baby seat that goes on the back of the bike or a trailer."

They responded on the 28th and told me they apologized and would send another copy out immediately via expedited shipping. They also issued me a refund for the shipping. I thanked them and awaited the newly shipped product. In early December, when the product still hadn't arrived, I asked for a tracking number.

My only disappointment with this product was in the lack of quality in the making of the DVD. It seems thrown together and very amatuerish and the instructor is not very convincing. In fact I just noticed the other day that the instructor from the DVD is the same lady in the commercial who says ""I've been a fitness instructor for 15 years and this takes pilates to the next level"". On the DVD she is working out alone and it just really is kind of boring. Also, the ""bonus"" DVD Abs and Buns is really not anything new; the same workouts are on the original DVD. Also, they only feature three measley arm exercises and although I feel them working, it just seems like it is not enough. Overall the workouts are effective it is just the workout video could be a whole lot better (more inviting, fun, motivating, etc.) Save some money and just get the ring by itself--I think Bally's has one."

I was driving as far as the 7-8 handicappers in my four-some, and my iron shots (the ones I didn't duff) were going straighter. This ball also putts very well. It seemed to fly off the face of my putter. I recommend practicing with these balls to see how they putt."
429566,0,"I've purchased this product before so I know what to expect out of it. It works well for a nice cardio workout. However, you must anchor it against a wall (The front of the machine towards the wall) or else it will move as you are using it. Also, eventually the round screws at the base of the stepper that hold the step and bar to the machine(The round part towards the front)will break from wear and tear. It can not be replaced. The step itself will keep sliding off the bar making it unsafe to use. The reason I purchase another one is because I love the folding feature. It's the smallest i've ever seen. It can fit under a bed or behind a door. :)"

26665,0,"I purchased a Celestron MAK C90, my first ever spotting scope, based on Amazon reviews. I wasn't impressed with the crude set screw adjustments but got it to work okay...but only for a few times before the focus broke. I returned the unit and over three months passed during which I could get no information on progress. Finally, I received a phone call from Celestron saying the C90 is no longer in production and that they will send me a replacement, 11049, a relatively fancy telescope I was told would work fine as a spotting scope. Again, about three weeks passed with no action, so I called and happily got a helpful person on the phone. After hearing my story and checking, he said he had to talk with his supervisor. He returned to say he could not send the 11049 as promised, that the C90 is still in production but back ordered, and that he would send a C130 which he called a ""hopped up"" C90. By then I was so tired of the situation that I just said, ""Fine."" The C130 finally did arrive, and proved to be a large, heavy, blown up version of the C90. It has the same crude set screw adjustments for the finder scope, the simple finder scope is hard to use as it pictures everything upside down and backwards, and I cannot center the cross hairs on the target with the little set screws. Neither of my two high quality tripods will adequately support the heavy C130 so I have ordered another. If I can't make this scope useful, I'm not sure I'll contact Celestron again."

337147,2,"What a disappointment!! The battery (cr2032) was not included in the package. It is listed as a component but was not there. Is this a way of keeping the price low, by not including components readily available at the local store and cheap enough so as to encourage consumers to not return the Omron pedometer. So - should I spend 10$ on return postage or quit buying Omron products and tell everyone I know about the missing component?"
332330,0,"Lots of boys over the ages have built this model. There seems to be a dividing line. There are the kids who build it. The kit is fine for them. There are not many peices, those are large, the instructions are easy to follow, and a fair kit can be made. Next, the kit is cheap at this point, at less than twenty dollars and that includes shipping.,Now, for the adults. First, surf over to steelnavy(dot)com and look at their builds. This kit isn't that bad but some things will have to be fixed. I would toss all the .50 caliber guns away and get new ones. Second, if you're building this model as JFK's boat then you're going to need to get a 1/72 scale 37mm anti-tank gun, remove the wheels, get some small wooden blocks, and put it on the bow of the boat. Hasegawa makes the US Army 37mm gun and those can be purchased at ebay . com. Amazon does not have them else I would have given you a product link to the site. Also, Squadron(dot)com might have the US Army's 37 mm gun. But if you're an adult you'll want to do the boat right and PT-109 did have an anti-tank gun on the front.This model by Revell can be converted into most of the typical Elco boats of WWII. If you want to build it as an Pacific Barge Buster then surf over to H R products (Google key words: H R ship fittings). In the 1/72 scale section they sell the complete sets of 37mm aircraft guns (not the same as the anti tank gun; that 37 mm gun was an automatic cannon pulled from P-39 fighter aircraft) and the 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun. Also, H R sells better .50 caliber machine guns (so does Squadron or anybody else for that matter). Last, H R sells the rack mounted torpedos used on PT boats in the post 1943 period. DO NOT TOSS away the 20mm gun if building a barge buster. The Bofors goes where the 20mm was mounted and that gun is moved to the front by the automatic 37mm gun. An Elco PT modified as a barge buster is a fast, torpedo armed gun boat. This kit is perfect for the conversion having thick plastic and general details that just welcome the scratch builder.Honestly, I like this kit and have built several over the years. It can be built as a simple mid-war PT boat or as a small barge-busting gun boat that wrecked a lot of Japanese Barge shipping in the late '44 to '45 period. Additionally, the Elco boats were used in the European War, around Italy, and they fought more than a few night missions with the extremely good German S-boots (German S-100 Fast Attack Boat w/Flak 38 by Revell Germany), a torpedo boat more than a match for a single PT. Yes, our guys usually won; there were lots of very deadly nights in the seas off the Italian coast from 1943 to 1945.I wish Revell would update the kit. But for the time being it's cheap. That is good for the kids. Since the adults will want to seriously improve this model the inexpensive price is good because it allows several purchases. It allows us to spend serious money at the other sites on after market supplies. No two PT boats were really standard by post 1944 and it's just as well the PT-109 kit comes to us ""standard"" because no two looked the same in the Navy after a few months in service.Here is a good reference at Amazon:US Patrol Torpedo Boats: World War II (New Vanguard)Note the gunboat version, mid-Pacific war, and European War verions and the difference in the paint.Trivia: the Pacific tropic weather was hard on the PTs, the vast majority had deck rot or plywood delamination by '46, and the fleet was pretty much all burned. Few survived past '47. Ironically, more of the real PT-109 exists than most of the fleet: http : // news . nationalgeographic.com / news / 2002 / 07 / 0709_020710_kennedyPT109 . htmlBest of luck with your build."

They seem sturdy.By the third or fourth ride, they were just right (surprisingly comfortable) and I've been enjoying them the last few months.My only complaint is as follows: the last few inches around which one wraps one's fingers could be longer. I tend to keep them angled slightly more to the vertical than most, perhaps, and when I tuck tightly down I practically run out of bar (propping myself against about a half an inch). But, one of the reasons that I bought them is because of this preference. So, in that sense, I am a little disappointed."

492703,1,"This must be my 6th G-Shock in about 25 yrs. Only one ever ""died""--the resin portion actually detached from the watch body and the repair was not cost effective (the watch itself still worked fine)-- other than that, every one has worked as advertised. I've given most of them away to people who are in-turn still wearing them. This 2300 is no different. The muted face does take some getting used to on this particular model however--it's very tough to see under low-light for instance--but the internal light works fine. It holds it's charge as well as any other solar cell watch I've ever had--it always reads as being fully charged. The style of the 2300 is also a little more pleasing to me than the much more common 6900s. The 6900 looks ""stiff"" and cumbersome to me; the lines of the 2300 seem to flow much nicer, if that makes any sense at all. And it's best feature is the manual power save shut-off. The other solar powered G-Shocks have a passive power save function. With the 2300 you can manually power down the watch--and keep it off--until you simply tap one of the buttons. And it continues to charge while shut-off. I find this to be a great feature. But here's the clincher--this thing (at least the watch I have) keeps unbelievable time. It gains about 1 second per week--at most. This is certainly quartz-like accuracy. Given this level of accurate time-keeping, the need to spend the extra money on the radio-controlled version (and worrying about whether or not you are somewhere you can receive the signal) is seriously called into question."

I think if we were mountain biking at midnight we would need something stronger, but for our purposes these are more than adequate."
103515,2,"I bought this pump to replace a Schwinn standup bicycle pump I bought in 1975 that finally broke...at least, the hose did. The all-metal construction of the rest of the pump probably would've lasted another three decades. I bought the Joe Blow based on price and good reviews here on Amazon.com. First thing I noticed upon unpacking it is that materials ain't what they used to be. The pump is mostly plastic; the metal compression tube is thin metal -- I think that may be the only metal part of the entire machine. The cheapness is borne out by the manufacturer's unbelievable pride and confidence in their product by offering an astounding 90 day warranty. That last sentence was satire; hopefully you got it.On the plus side, the pump has a dual schrader/presta nozzle, which is handy. My old trusty Schwinn was schrader, so I had to keep a presta adapter handy for my bike. Unfortunately, this dual nozzle makes it bulky, and I had trouble fitting it over the schrader valves of my cars to inflate the tires because of the tight clearance between the valve and the rims. Also, the gauge on the Joe Blow is hideously innaccurate. Not even in the ballpark on the two bike tires and eight automobile tires I inflated, then doublechecked with my AccuMaster tire gauge (""Best stinkin' tire gauge in the entire Universe"" according to Click & Clack, and I don't doubt it...). So far off as to be utterly useless.One more complaint: It's tough to pump. I have no idea why this would be, but I had a hard time inflating my bike tires to proper (120 lbs. psi) pressure. All-in-all, I'm very disapointed in this merchandise.UPDATE: In this product's favor, I have now been using it for over a year and it's still working. I don't use the built-in gauge to measure tire pressure -- it's just too inaccurate. The most annoying feature is the difficulty in pumping up bike tires to recommended pressure. I'm a pretty strong guy, and I can just barely do it when thrusting down with all my might. Not a recommended product, but as I said, still working in it's most necessary capacity."

331563,2,"I loved the design, before pieces started breaking off with normal light-duty use running it on the bottom of the pool and cleaning a few harder to reach steps, I had found it to be a very handy tool for the price. The problem is it really only lasted a couple weeks, so the perceived value quickly diminishes, I had a more expensive counterpart from another company that lasted over 2 years so I had much higher expectations for this tool.The item is too cheaply made as evident by the price and quality of parts, invest a little more in something more rugged, I will be this time."

384555,0,"I really liked the clean, first class look of my new Marinco Zip cover when it arrived. Our boat is under cover and having the cords nicely shielded made the area absolutely ""ship shape"". The problem is that it isn't very well built...for a $50 piece of nylon. We take the boat out about 30 times a year...and in about nine months the Velcro ends were clearly beginning to fray, and the teeth from the fairly light duty zippers were coming off (and this is NOT exposed to direct sunlight). Eighteen months later-and its junk. Probably twenty percent of the teeth have pulled out from normal use (for us, normal use is simply pushing the twin power cords with the Zip cover back in the storage bay). I think its up to you...if you want to look GREAT as long as you don't use it at all, or GREAT for a short time...this is the product. In boat dollars, it really is a rounding error, but I'm thinking that two 12' high end nylon zippers on 24' of nylon with some velcro attachment strips could be done a bit better at this price point, or sell it cheaper and designate it as a short life cycle accessory. It does look really really good though for as long as it holds together...and I think it ought to be good for a year of covered use or a season of salt and sun."

478650,1,I purchased this seat post about a month ago. Very happy with the item. It performs as advertised. I use it on a hybridized mountain bike that I ride on a rough chip and seal road. It takes out the jarring impact of the bumps and irregularities of the road surface. It's not meant to be used on off road rocky trails. If you want long travel you have to pay the $$$.I plan to maintain the unit as the mfg. suggests and I think it will give me the service that they promise.
362099,2,"This trike is fine in most of the ways it should be. The handlebar assembly is difficult to adjust & tighten properly, but that's par for the course these days.What is inexcusable is the stench of chemicals coming off the rubber (?) tires. How can no one else have mentioned this? Were ours the only tires made of material recycled from a toxic waste dump?I thought the smell would blow off, but now it's been almost 5 months with no abatement (in fact it's worse in warm weather!) making me REALLY wonder if i should let my kids ride this thing.A return at this point seems unlikely -- perhaps I should buy new tires? But at what cost!?"
476736,2,"Ordered this product for off-duty carry of my cuffs and spare mag. I liked the paddle option as my current case requires a take my belt off to disarm. However, when I received the case, I realized just how overly massive this it is. There's at least a quarter inch, probably closer to three-eights between the paddle and case itself (I know my pants aren't that thick), plus no curvature at all to keep it close to my hip. Secondly, I ordered a size 4 for my HK USP magazines, and there is an excessive amount of play in the mag pouch, so much that if you're running, your mag is gonna come out. The cuff pouch is also larger than needs to be, does not fit S&W; 100 cuffs securely, but gives them plenty of room to make some noise.I give it two stars for quality leather, but it's not gonna work for my needs."

LUCKILY we knew someone there that happened to have a tool that was able to hammer the defect out. If he had not been there, however, the tent would not have been usable. I highly recommend anyone who purchases this tent set it up in advance to make sure it is free from defects. Besides this however, the screen house endured moderately windy conditions and some rain for a whole weekend. It is NOT waterproof by any means (which I wasn't expecting). Overall, besides the defect it was a decent purchase."

Then a couple of months later, it felt like the pedals were jerking. This steadily got worse, and I started noticing black fragments under the bike after use (again, as mentioned by others) so I got a long screw driver and opened up the plastic wheel casting. Sure enough, the underside of the belt has started wearing away, causing the pedals to slip, and making using the bike more and more difficult.I have sent an email to the company, but I'm not holding my breath for a fix, let alone a response. Although I have been pleased with my workout until now, I am disappointed that it was not made to last."

It's a little tough to explain but basically it's a shoddy product that's built poorly.

I emailed the company, twice and called them to see if I could get a replacement tube or to purchase a repair kit. I was never contacted. I understand that there is only a year warranty but this was quite a disappointment as we did not cause the problem...it was a defect. RAVE SPORTS has Very poor customer service...I email back would have been nice as I needed to purchase another tube and went with another company. Bryan Outboard, Inc through Amazon is great...we bought the BIG MABLE from them and it arrived in 3 days and their customer service is great as well as being the best price."
138140,0,"While the pictures look nice, it is very difficult to get the desired results. My 16 year old son carved the big ""G"" with ""Packers"" under it. The ""G"" is not supported well enough and collapses. It was also difficult to cut out the fine carvings due to the kit only coming with the larger tool. He used the tool from another kit we had and it was easier."
499872,1,I replaced my old Hayward filter with this one a few days ago. I had a monster of a filter that came with my house but started to give me trouble. Since the parts to fix the old one were so expensive it was just cheaper to spend the 200+ on this one and know it is completely new. The first thing I must say is that is was a lot smaller than I thought. The set up was easy. Probably took me about two hours. It takes 3 50lbs bags of sand and has a little cardboard piece stopper that prevents sand from going into the tube when you pour it in. Since you have to change the sand every few years I wish it was a more durable plastic piece so it would last longer. I also wish it came with the piping for the valve. Currently it is working fine however I have a few leaks from the piping. It was probably my fault but thought I would mention it. All in all I am happy and hopefully this will be the last thing I need to replace. Also the Amazon price was literally half the price. My local place wanted $400 for this. I had to hold myself back so I didn't laugh in his face. All three local places in my area wanted to charge between 380 and 450 for this. I love Amazon.

78994,0,"The insta-gator will not work on a bike with a front fender. That I discovered only by looking at the installation picture (no fender on the bike used). The other (minor) problem is that my truck bed is high off the ground and my bike heavy. That means I have to open the tailgate to load / unload the bike. When I do that, the insta-gator comes loose and that means it has to be re-adjusted when the tailgate goes up again. For daily use, I found this annoying. However, once adjusted and the bike in place, it is secure and does a good job of holding the bike."

280808,2,"I was disappointed with the ability of this mat to cushion my sitting bones while doing P90X (P90X+) ab routines. The 3/4"" floor matting I use does a little better job, and what's the point of adding this on top of the matting if the padding immediately gives way when you sit on it? Padding needs to pad."

502329,2,"So I got my bo and was really excited, pulled it out of the box, looked like maybe red oak, but felt way too light. Upon further inspection noticed a large scratch (almost a gash) in the side and that it was odviously some sort of soft wood with a veneer finish. This makes it lightweight witch is kinda nice, but I was planning on using it in my martial arts class but now am unsure if it could stand the pressure."

416052,0,"Beware of the white anchors and screws that come with this clock. The holes for the anchor where the screw goes into is too small. Thus when you think you have finished mounting the clock to the wall; you have not. The anchors spin out of the wall from the tension caused by the screw hole on the anchor is about 1/8th of an inch too small. The end result is that you will encounter 3 really nasty holes in your wall left by the white anchors and no clock mounted to the wall. It is really a shame too because the clock itself is a nice quality for the price. This is so typical of hardware that comes with these type of clocks made in China. Best thing to do now is go to the local hardware an purchase good quality anchors and heavy duty screws that match. That is the end state. The manufacturer needs to make the requirement change of the included hardware is all to fix the problem. The instructions were crude pictures and arrows. In addition...We have had our clock for 2 weeks. It is a beautiful clock but they installed a cheap Taiwan clock mechanism and now it doesn't work properly. The second hand gets stuck. I am so disappointed because the clock itself looks like a nice value and made pretty well. Why they went cheap on the clock mechanism makes no sense at all. What good is a clock if it cannot keep time despite the fact that you can conceal a firearm in the clock. It brings attention to itself by not working. What is the point of that if you are attempting to conceal a firearm. The ""DAH"" factor is unbelievably stupid."

130043,0,"beautiful ball- and yes, it is cheaper than the MLS stadium vendors.But it's kind of ""cosmetic""- it's great to look at - just not to play with. It's really glossy leather and it kind of sticks to your skin if you juggle barefoot. Also it seems kind of light and too bouncy- like a beachball.If you like the team, buy it, get it autographed, put it on the mantle. If you want to play soccer then buy a regular, cheap ball."
407447,1,"It's small, lightweight, and works well for sports balls. Would be nice though if the hose and needle were easilly stored within the unit, when attached it's kind of long."
88707,0,I don't like the design of this. 3 white stripes on the collar looks stupid. I like the triangle logo.
186582,1,"I received the order very quickly. It was very simple to hook the bike up and get it working. Other customers stated that it was noisey, like a vaccum cleaner, BUT I found it no noisier than a threadmill working. You can still bike and watch the tv without the volume blasting. I did find that putting a book (or I used a high step riser) under the front tire raised it up the 2 inches needed to make the bike level for me. I would rec this unit to anyone who wants to use their old bike inside instead of purchasing an expensive excercise bike."
139471,0,"My Gripmaster is about 4 or 5 months old and, at first, I liked it a lot. I use it all the time, especially in the car, and I think that this extensive use is the problem. It's starting to fall apart bit by bit. If you're hyper-active you might consider a simple racquet or tennis ball because these things (I bought a medium and heavy gripper) don't seem to stand up very well. The design is excellent but the quality, especially around the springs, leaves a lot to be desired. Sorry, I really wanted these things to last."
322014,2,Amazon sent me the watch with the wrong band. Then I called to exchange it and found they didn't have the watch I ordered in stock. It took me a week and 3 callbacks just to get an address and instructions on returning the thing. Probably they sent me the wrong one hoping I'd keep it. It was a pain to have to return it and they didn't even reimburse me the full cost of shipping it back.
208453,1,"I got this for those days that I did not know I could go riding outdoors do to weather. I read the reviews about loudness and tension. I also saw people discounting those posts here is what I found for myself. First off I do have a bike with the quick disconnect axle but mine did not work I had to use the one provided. Second, I did find it was a bit louder that I thought but as others have posted if you have nobbies on your tires it's going to be loud. Thirdly, when I first put my bike on i had the Magnetic resistance portion lightly touching the wheel thinking that would be the best way to make it work. I found that did not help, even on the most resistive setting and me on the highest gear it still was too easy. I did find tightening the magnetic mechanism tighter to the wheel helped out a lot. Once I did those tweaking the device has worked great for me. I ride 3 times a week about 16 miles each time. In that distance I cover hills both up and down so it's not just a strait shot. That being said I found this product an ok substitute to the real thing."

351619,1,"I purchased a variety of taillights to try out, and this was the brightest from quite a wide viewing angle, and the one I decided to use. The amber side LEDs are quite nice, too. It's probably too bright on a completely dark path for the bike right behind you, but very effective with streetlights, etc., around. I like the styling of the Mars 2.0 a little better, but it is not quite as bright or quite as wide a viewing angle as this. The mounting bracket is very well done, and unique. It mounts to the frame with a tension strap that you tighten with a penny, and it can pivot up/down (with a penny) quite an angle. Of course you can also slide it onto your belt, etc."
389981,0,"I purchased this canopy for business use at the farmers market. I was starting the market and began vending at outdoor events where a canopy was required. It was affordable and a good investment. Later on I ordered the sand bag holders to weigh it down. It takes two people to set it up and it takes a few times to get the hang of it. I think it really needs 3 people or at least one person that's familiar with setting them up. We almost smashed our fingers a few times! But, it fit easily into my little trunk and it easy enough to put back into the bag. The bag is a bit cheap around the zipper so be careful when trying to stuff it back into the bag(fit it very snug). One trick I learned is to line it up very closely next to the other canopies. It's lightweight, I carry it by myself in & out of the car and up & down our apartment stairwell. After seeing other vendors pop their canopies up easily and asking around, I'm going to invest in a white(preferred by event promoters) that's a better quality canopy. And, if you need the fire retardant certificate for this canopy, you'll have to go online to the website & print it out. The certificate is required by farmers markets in California. I will say that the tent hasn't ripped and it still looks good."
82013,0,"I love this brand of shorts which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, I misunderstood the description and when I click on different links to the item, it changes from Juniors to Girls. I understood Juniors to mean teenage girl age. As a 20 year old girl, I can easily wear a M/L in these shorts for Juniors/adults. When I got my package, I received a Youth Large instead. I had to give the shorts to someone else who could wear them because I needed them on a time crunch. This is a good brand, just a little confusing on the description."

409914,0,"Received the package in a timely manner but the shipping carton was not a good fit and was ripped. The package was too big and the mat heavy so it shifted to one side. The thin cardboard around the mat from the manufacturer was very ripped and the mat had some pressure dents but no rips. Also, as noted by someone else, the picture shows lines going horizontally across the width of the mat. In reality, there are long lines running vertically from top to bottom. I haven't had a chance to use the mat yet due to surgery but I am assuming it will work fine for pilates. If I could have found the perfect ""mail-back package"", I might have returned it. I am hoping the lines parallel to my feet will not interfere with balance poses. I think having the lines perpendicular to my feet would grasp better."
86753,2,"I really wanted to love this knife. All the other reviews are so positive, and it seems so cool, but once it came it feels like such a dollar store knockoff.The Handle: I understand that it's super light weight, and I'll admit that as a long time Gerber owner and fan of heavier knives, I was predisposed to dislike it. However, even beyond that it just feels so cheap and it gets slippery with the slightest bit of oil on it (I'm a line cook and use this knife in the kitchen for cutting cheese cloth, butcher's twine, etc.) Speaking of cutting twine, the pocket clip covers the super convenient notch for cutting string, so the blade is completely inaccessible and cutting string is nearly impossible.The Lock: The lock can either be slid forward or backward to unlock the knife, depending on which position it was in when the knife was opened. The problem with this is that unless you move it again after closing the knife, you have to slide the lock a different way each time. Annoying when you're in a hurry to put the knife away and get back to work.The Blade: Sharp and sturdy enough, but it's so heavy in contrast to the nylon handle, but by this point I'm just so disappointed with the knife that everything has started to annoy me.The Worst of All: Unless you have some sort of goliath hands that could probably just rip anything you needed to cut anyway, the knife is completely impossible to close with one hand. The assist system rewinding is so stiff it takes two hands to close the knife.Overall, I wish I had bought another Gerber or Kold Steel. And I probably will."

321085,0,"I bought this coat in both blue and green - after reading the reviews that it does not have side pockets. I bought them at REI as they were on sale for 114.00. The colors are amazing - and on the first day I wore the green one I got compliments from almost everyone I ran into. I skied in it at Breckenridge in sub zero temperatures and it kept me very warm. I just make sure when I wear it I wear something under it that has pockets - ie: A down vest or a hoodie with pockets to keep my phone etc. If running around town it is not as big a deal as I usually have my purse.So as long as you are willing to deal with the no pocket part - it is a really, really cute jacket, very flattering, great colors, and suprisingly warm. However having said all of that I would not buy it unless it is on sale..."
381994,2,The zipper slides completely off when it is unzipped. If you have the flap open make sure you have a special storage place for the zipper so you dont lose it. This could have been prevented by sewing it correctly.

The table top, however, was in excellent condition. Had I received all of the chips, I would have given this product five stars."
60723,1,We have a huge problem with squirrels chewing the wiring harnesses in our new vehicles. A Chevrolet dealer told me that GM uses wiring that has a sort of vegetable oil in the wiring insulation. This coating attracts rodents especially during the colder winter months when the vehicle can provide shelter and a food source.We put one of these inside the vehicle's engine compartment and ran an extension cord out the front grill. When we get home we plug the vehicle in and this has prevented the rodents from chewing the wires. First time cost me $2800 bucks second time I found the wiring harness at a junk yard. There will not be a 3rd time thanks to this device!!!
297626,0,"I had one of these a relatively short while ago. I bought it up in Boston, and it seemed like a good investment. It is cheap, and has a lot of useful things on it. I kept it in my wallet because it seemed like a convenient place for it. It worked perfectly for the first two months or so, but then I started having issues. Behind the edge with the ruler, there is a seam. Because I had my wallet in my back pocket (like most people), the seam started to break, and the plastic cracked. This worsened over a month or so, and then the tweezers and the toothpick got stuck inside, and the only way to get them out was to crack it open. I closed it up with Krazy glue and some duct tape, and went on with my life.The little knife is pretty crappy, but comes sharp. It shouldn't be used for much more than opening letters and cutting light plastic.It is a great thought in general, but I recently switched over to the Tool Logic equivalent, and I much prefer it."
295235,1,"I'd use a patch for bigger ones, and the seam sealer for seam issues though."
346812,0,"I have used the snorkel twice since I purchased the set. Amazon shipped the product very quickly. Everything seems to work well. The flippers seem to be pretty sturdy and seem like they will be able to take quite a bit of abuse.The mask is the one piece that I had problems with. It does not obstruct your view, but it does seem difficult to keep the strap tight on your head when you put it on, causing water to seep in when you first enter the water and the pressure changes. If you attempt to tighten the strap it eventually works its way loose. If you inhale through your nose you can keep enough suction to keep the water out, however.Other than that it seems like a great snorkel set for a beginner."
441201,2,I purchased one of these and it would not penatrate a cardboard box from 15 feet! It would barely shoot a bolt 25 feet. They are being sold everywhere and someone should put a stop to it! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!

258352,0,And another thing to consider is if you have a crimson trace laser sight like a LG-405 for your Smith & Wesson J-Frame 442 it might be impossible to use this or any speedloader. If you open the S&W 442 Airweight's cylinder you'll see not much room for a speedloader to do it's job. Best to check it out at your local dealer for a fit.

14012,0,"I've tried to like this pedal, I really have. Maybe it's my signal chain (?) My experience with the DigiTech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar. Sure, the OD is there, but it isn't worth losing your tone, is it? Again, I reiterate maybe it's just me. I have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now. And the blue pedal isn't any different, either IMO. Grunge was OK, but not my kind of style."

I was loathe to try this spray, but the label assures us it's safe, and we always rinse our harvest anyway, so why not? I've yet to see a tomato beetle, and while the ants keep coming back, they don't seem to do too much damage. It's kind of something I only use when I start to notice a lot of bugs around, but I don't like to scare away lady bugs and other beneficials, so use wisely and with caution. Particularly seems to have saved my baby avocado tree that was getting eaten alive!"
372536,2,"I wish there was an option to give no stars but alas there isnt...Anyways the only reason this product attracted my attention was the fact that it had a high percentage of cotton and the availibility of many colors and I went ahead and ordered 7 of them in small size and different colors (BIG MISTAKE) . The product arrived in timely manner , however when i opened the packaging and touched the fabric i had the worst shocks of my life, it felt like touching a sandpaper !! i mean what kind of cotton is this to feel like a sandpaper ,and on top of that the cut and the styling was so bad it looked like they used different size arm section for the torso ; the arms especially around the shoulders was massive like xxxl !! the styling is so bad and out of proportion it defies logic...it looked like they were sewn together from scrap fabrics by someone who was tripping...And the fabric gotten even tougher after one wash , even with the fabric softeners.Needless to say i am regally pissed off and because i ordered this from overseas i cant bear the cost of returning it back , but one thing is certian that i will never ever buy anything that has the brand HANES written over it..."

118999,1,Purchased a pair of these for my hybrid bicycle.They were received promptly and closely match the original tires.If they last even one season they are a bargain at this price!Update 10/02/11. I installed these tires yesterday on my hybrid bike.They went on easily and look great.My only issue is the little rubber molding nipples all over the tires surface.I used a propane touch to burn them off.Do not do this indoors!At 75 psi they roll with little resistance.nice
44071,1,The size is great for almost everything you could need a cooler for. The cup holders on top are a great addition. Sturdy & sharp looking. Got it as a gift and was tempted to keep it myself. Would definitely buy another one for gift or personal use.
320865,0,"Grips fit great, had to drill a bigger hole in the spring holder so that grip pen could fit all the way through the pistol frame. Pin will not budge at all due to the downward force of the spring, which is a good thing if the same method is needed for other people. My only regret was that I only received one grip screw with the kit. On Youtube similar kits had two grip screws. Not sure if I received a used kit or if it was a error that happened at the factory. Had to go to the hardware store and buy two new screws so that the grip installation would look uniform upon completion."

501578,2,"I bought one of these and the first 1/2 dozen balls it worked great. The balls spun, I marked them, I moved them and respun, they went back to the same spot. I gave a good review where I bought it. The next 1/2 dozen balls, when I put the pen to the ball, it knocked it off line, and would not line up in the same spot again. At first I thought maybe the ball was wacko, but 6 in a row? I wrote the company asking what was going on. It's been over a week and no response. The batteries were brand new, the balls were brand new, I had it on a level surface."

273732,1,"This is a great trap for controlling squirrels. I live in the city and have several fruit trees on my property. It seemed like word got around in the squirrel community that my yard was an open buffet. I had cage traps which are not very effective and leave you with a frantic squirrel to release so that it can become someone else's problem ten miles away. It took a couple days for the squirrels to become accustomed the the device. I used apple cores as my bait. After 3 days of the trap being outside, the squirrels suddenly started going for the bait. I have only had one instance where the trap was triggered but didn't result in a capture.Do not let the size of these fool you. They are strong traps and not a toy. Unfortunately, I learned the hard way when it snapped shut on the nail bed of my ring finger. :-( After lots of ice and first aid creme, it is healing up fine.The strong action of these traps result in a quick clean kill similar to that of a mouse trap. Setting them is easy, but it am very nervous about accidentally triggering it once it is set.These are made of mild steel which means they are prone to rust if not cared for properly. Mine was outside on our deck during a small snow and was covered in surface rust the next day. I was able to remove it all with a scotch-brite pad and WD-40. I need to look up the proper way to maintain these traps in wet environments. I do wish they made them in stainless steel."
260457,0,"I love this item for what it does. It lights up the tent pretty well, for such a dinky thing. If you need to get up in the middle of the night to use the toilet while you are camping, this is a really handy thing to have.I don't know why I thought that something bought new in this day-in-age would utilize LED technology. Unfortunately, these do not, which means that if you blow out the lamp it will be difficult to buy a replacement. Unfortunately, it also means that the 4 AA batteries required to operate these units will not last a very long time.Other than that, we are happy with them but wonder why they didn't used LED technology which last much longer and requires much less power."

194723,1,"Used my new MSR Superfly Stove and I was very happy with it. It is very easy to light and way to easy to adjust the flame control. I timed the boiling of water with this stove and another propane camp stove side by side, Wow was I impressed!!"
485167,1,"I practice yoga a few times a week at home. I had been using the strap of my purse (it detaches) for stretching the legs and figured it was time to order the appropriate prop for my exercise. The length of this strap is perfect for me (5""6 female) and it is extremely durable. I have had no need for the buckle but prefer the metal to plastic end. I am very happy with this buy...it's well made & the colors are fun too!"
186958,1,The quality of these guns are getting better and better. Professional and amatuer airsoft fans should open their possibilities and give different guns a try. Many Tactical and Naval forces use this as their weapon of choice. It is already good to see that airsoft versions of these can be used effectively in mock combat.
411167,0,The handles need more foam cushioning and the base can sometimes wobble when doing wide arm push ups. Otherwise they are lightweight and breakdown nicely for travel.
91430,0,Nice quality sweatshirt. Unfortunately the website shows the color that I bought to more of a lime green. When it arrived it is more of a glow in the dark green. In face I think it would glow in the dark.Took longer to get to me then promised.
83065,0,"This jacket fits great, and looks great, but is just a bit too thin. I love the raspberry jam color! I would like the jacket better if it was completely lined. It will keep me dry, and prevent the wind from coming through, but will not add warmth. It is also noisy and the nylon makes a swooshing sound when my arms rub the body of the jacket. It was almost worth the price I paid. If I had paid more, I would have been really disappointed."
218795,0,"The wheel cover is nice and sturdy, but the lettering peels off after a short while. Would not buy again for the price, it's way over priced. I can buy ones that hold up longer at Walmart alot cheaper. It's too bad you can't show off your team"
300209,2,"This must be more ideal for a handgun. The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15, Remington 12 gauge, nor my Reuger .22. The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger, however, when I tried that, I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun. The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved. I should have returned it, but I was lazy."
92809,1,Worked perfectly no tools required for installing. Didn't require gear adjustment either. Overall would recommend to anyone looking to replace their current cassette.
94937,0,"My slim 4 year old sits in it fine. My 8 year old couldn't even think of squeezing in.These are very popular at most camps, and are really cool little things, but we mistakenly bought this model for our 8 year old and it didn't work."
425781,0,I have used these for years to stand watch on a ship for hours in the cold. They really get hot and last all night. The. Last box I got may be defective. Most of the packets tore open at the seams and leaked out a sandlike substance that stained my fingernails black. It remains in my gloves and is difficult to clean out and difficult to remove from under my nails.
479360,1,"I thought the material would be of poor quality for the price, and I was really surprised by the high quality of the shirt (s) for the price. The gift receiver was extremely happy, as its difficult for him to find clothing of good quality, good price, and fantastic fit. This was a winner!!"
267598,0,5 people in my family were learning how to throw knives with this knife and took alot of abuse. 2 of them I still have the 3rd one broke and looking at the brake it appears it's been cracked for sometime. If you want a better throwing knife try the Gil Hibben Large Throwers.
167474,0,"These are the second and third hammocks of this kind that I have purchased as gifts. The first one I bought had ropes to wrap around the tree to hang the hammock from. When I read the other reviews before purchasing many of the top reviews stated that ropes were included. When I received my shipment of the additional two hammocks, neither one had ropes included. I then read further into the reviews and many people had the same experience. I don't know if this is a fluke but it makes me wonder how some are arriving with ropes for attachment and some not. So don't expect them and if they come with ropes.......you got a bonus! I will now have to purchase strapes for each new hammock that I just bought."
107137,2,I bought this yesterday - no where does it tell you how to install it - I emailed Schwinn but have not heard back - How about a little instruction for people who do not know how to put on your product - even POP TARTS have instructions!!!!!
286267,1,"""The Husky Wooden Tip-Up offers dependable lunker-landing performance year after year without freeze-up."" This is what the product description claims on another website, and so far, it seems to be a true statement. I'm always very leery about trying new products, but my money was well spent on this fine Tip-Up. It features a premium wooden frame, 200' capacity easy-flow metal spool, easy-lock line guide for easy set-up, and a deluxe trip wire. I've enjoyed one season with it so far, and so far it seems to be a wonderful product. Based upon that fact, and being able to test its endurance, I would recommend this to anyone."
95240,0,"This was a lot smaller than the picture depicted. Because of the view, I was expecting more than one item in the box."
287546,0,"I gave this product 3 stars for one reason: the color is NOT what I ordered. I ordered PURPLE; I received what looks like an odd navy blue. The whole purpose for ordering purple was to match a team uniform. Although the UA tag had a purple strip to indicate the shirt was purple, it was not. I'm guessing it was a factory second because of the color. I will choose another vendor -- UA directly -- to ensure I receive the color I expect."
29476,1,WORKS WELL. NO MALFUNCTIONS SO FAR. USED IT SEVERAL TIMES. I USE TWO DECKS IN THE CARD GAMES I PLAY.
272849,0,Good value for the price. Size shrinks slightly and need to keep this in mind when ordering a snug fit.
96896,1,"This item came exactly as described and in excellent condition. I was kept informed throughout, and received it much sooner than expected. I would definitely do business with them again."

67866,1,Used it for drop keel on my boat and so far no problem will have to see how long the powdercoat lasts with the salt water
319513,2,I've had two of these and both failed in the stem area after 3-4 months of fairly heavy use. Had to glue to the helmet with contact cement.Worked pretty well until the stem failures. Mirror should be a little larger.
507687,1,"I have several of these shorts. Yes, they are top notch exercise shorts, but more importantly for me is that they are great lounging shorts and the most comfortable pajama bottoms you can wear. The moisture wicking effect means that you will be comfortable throughout the night and still be ready if the kids decide to jump in bed with you and yours. As soon as I am sure that I am not going out again I change into these and a UA tee shirt. Try it, you will never go back to traditional pajamas again."
348286,0,"On first glance the megaphone is a decent buy. The 10-second record feature was nice, however the placement of the ""record"" button made it very easy to accidentally record over any pre-recording. Also, a good thing to note: DO NOT STORE FOR EVEN ONE DAY WITH BATTERIES INSIDE UNIT! I bought 6 megaphones and lost two before even using them to batteries leaking and destroying the megaphone (I put the batteries in them the night before the event so I wouldn't forget and found them ruined in the morning). Also, out of the 6 initially purchased, 1 didn't work upon delivery. So out of 6 I was left with three before the intended event. Of the three that made it, they functioned ok, but not great. All three had problems with the hand-held microphone not picking up sound properly and blasting only static into the crowd. The siren feature worked great the entire time... so they were great tools to get attention, but not so great communicating with crowds. I'd definitely recommend paying a little more for a higher-end megaphone from the start. I know I'll be buying new ones before my next event."
41454,0,"it showed up pretty quick and it is a nice saints flag but it was too small for my garden flag stand (should have looked at the deminsions of the flag first). instead, i have it hanging in my front window, looks better there."
466630,1,Awesome knife. It's so sharp and stays sharp unlike the off brand cheepo knives. I know Gerber has a great name but didn't know just how great their products are until I owned this little gem.
332617,1,"I love this computer because of the 4 line display - the information you want is always available to you. But the button is odd: though it looks from the photo like the gray area on the bottom is a button, it's really just a colored area. When you push it, the entire unit slides up in the handlebar bracket on which it is mounted, causing a smaller button underneath to be depressed. I wrote the company to ask why they did it this way; never got an answer. The unit itself works fine, though I would have definitely preferred a real button."
387196,0,This Barbell pad came on time but unfortunately we have not used it yet. So I really cannot give a good or bad review.
47020,1,What can you say: it's just a lanyard. I buy these for all my volleyball referees on the NYC Board because of the good quality.The seller was very efficient and quick with the order - a great pleasure to deal with. I will buy from them again next year.
69617,0,"pretty good for the price. However, the ball is harder than I expected and the pole slides around in the shelve that the pole is put in, so it is not very stable. You really want a soft ball so that children don't hurt their hands."
337158,1,"The HJ-112 is a reasonable size, and easy to carry. The counter seems very accurate, which is the most important part. It is, however, a bit too sensitive at times. When I sit, it often keeps counting, because of my sifting in the seat. I also wish there was a total counter. It counts per day, for several days, then starts over. You probably have to record the numbers yourself."
65311,2,I took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately I gave them away after trying them on. The fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible.
51674,0,"Order was received as described, shipped on time and received in good condition. I was replacing a Lifetime adjustable portable goal and backboard system, model #1510 that I had for 15 years. From the description I thought I was purchasing a comparable Lifetime portable basketball base, backboard, and goal system. I had no problem assembling the product but it is not as sturdy, equal or better to the package that I had. The goal seem to be tilted up at the front so I will verify that that is the case and probably call Lifetime customer service tomorrow."
417828,0,"I like this knife. The blade is a good shape and length. The grip is comfortable. The thin profile allows it to sit in the pocket without being cumbersome. I don't like pocket clips. They gouge the walls I come into contact with, make the grip awkward, and snag on everything; so I took it off immediately.Within the first 10 openings I noticed that the thumb stud on the blade was loose. It continued to loosen over the next couple days. It has not yet fallen out, but I'm not happy about it. I called the Gerber Warranty department and told them how disappointed I was by this. I told them that my last Gerber pocket knife had been with me for 12 years of daily abuse and had never had any quality issues like this. She didn't bat an eyelash over my disappointment. She said I should just screw it back in and apply a thread locker and that if it did fall off, she could send me a new one as it was under warranty. I've tried like crazy to unscrew it but it's not budging. I've successfully destroyed the finish of the stud, but no luck with unscrewing it. I think I got bad information. I think it's a press fit.Bottom line: I don't expect a $20 pocket knife to be sent from the heavens. It's made in China, which kinda sucks from Gerber. I'm not happy with the thumb stud situation. I'm more or less satisfied, though. I'm happy I've got it because it's a vast improvement over the seriously abused Gerber I've had for over a decade. 3 stars = ""It's OK"" and that's exactly how I feel about it. It's OK."
210061,0,The buttons are too big.The buttons are to easy to hit. Every time she looks at it it is on a different thing. Also every number except for the current time are to small to see.I like it cause its the only womans digital watch I could find.I don't know why they can't make just a plain watch with out all those extra stuff no one cares about.
386774,2,"Made in Pakistan! Total junk, I'd rather have them from China! Valeo used to make good quality lifting gloves, 4-5 years ago. I had purchased 10 pairs back then because I liked the Pro Lifting Series Gloves. But sorry these new one's are total junk and there made in Pakistan!!! The package also says 2010. Look else where!"
470391,0,"This is a large, but thin, watch. Some sport models are dubbed ""tuna cans"" because they are so thick. This piece is very thin, yet still solid and hefty. Very comfortable to wear. Two issues, though, have me not wearing it often:1. The hour markers and silver trim circle around the minute totalizer makes reading the hands difficult - almost Breitling busy - I prefer a much more easy readable dial.2. the minute totalizer is non-standard at 40 minutes (why 40? the standard is either 10 or 30 minutes). The exra minutes are compressed into a dial that is only 2/3 of a circle. It is again difficult to easliy read the accumulated minutes - too imprecise for acutal sport use.While the 1/100 is great, I can never read off the stopped time counters in an event (racing, running, etc) without having to stop and carefully see where the minute timer has stopped.Looks great, feels great, but not useful as a sport chronograph and even standard time is not clear - the dial is just too busy."
180513,1,This is a very warm fleece jacket. I bought the charcoal grey one and it looks great! I already have a Columbia sportswear vest--the Columbia products are well-made and last a long time.
361873,1,"I been playing indoor and outdoor ball now for about 20 years and been through a bunch of different indoor balls, but being primarily a hitter, this ball is the best I've owned. I have had a gold before and quite frankly it handles better than the SV5WI ball, but the durability is a serious question mark.The SW5VI can take a serious beating without deforming and can sometimes leave a bit of a sting on the passer, but all in all is the best bang for your buck that is out there. You don't have to worry about warming up with this ball, feel free to throw and hit this bugger into the wall, unlike the gold, which needs a pillow in your gym bag or the panels fall off. The gold would be the best if not for the durability factor, but the international makes up for it with some extra ""stank"" on hits.Love this for the price on Amazon and the ultra-fast shipping made the transaction a bit sweeter. Went with the red and black.. gotta go with the black."
408530,1,I purchase Under Armour gear for my husband each Christmas. We have yet to be dissatisfied with their products. Highly recommend.
181048,0,"Everything was sharp and clean, except the sides were scratched up. Someone probably got a bunch of defective ones, explains why price was so good. Not a good gift as it would look used, but other than the few scratches everything was in new condition."
231705,0,"The product seems to do what it claims, but after sucking and squeezing like crazy to get the water out I ditched it for a brita pitcher. If I go kayaking and have limited space I'll take this along, but only if I can't take my regular wilderness filter."
296184,0,"I ordered these socks because no matter how many pair of boots I order I cannot seem to find any that are warm and waterproof. I ordered these socks in the hopes that they would provide warmth to waterproof boots. I ended up returning the socks (the seller was very competent and helpful) because they were VERY thick, way too thick to fit under my boots."
314293,2,"I bought this for my son cause the price seemed reasonable, but when I got it, it was really small. Not true to size at all. My son has 2 other karate uniforms size 000, and this one seemed to be made for a 2 year old, not 50 lbs! I gave it to a friend who has a tiny 4 yr old."
364723,2,"I bought one of these racks at a bike store, loaded it with 29 pounds of gear (it is rated for 55) and went biking in Scotland.The sided bent in damaging my spokes twice causing me to get the wheel trued.The sides snapped off from the top after 322 miles. The tubing ishollow aluminum. It simply is not tough enough for the task."
411134,0,"Excellent design, but plastic, so they lack rigidity: they flex and move, and I weigh under 200 lbs. Tube diameter is too narrow, so they cut into palms, and I routinely push weights and ride bicycle. Padding sleeves are the most wear-out prone parts, yet extras are not included. I would eagerly pay more for fatter aluminum tubes with better padding and extra sleeves."
55113,0,"This is very much as described. However, the one thing I don't like is that the compass (which works just fine) is set up so that it shows the direction you're coming from. That is to say, when you mount it correctly, and say you're facing north, the South pole of the compas is facing you so you're reading the direction you're coming from, not where you're headed. This could confuse the dim-witted!!!! :-)"
304536,0,"The product I received is completely pink - including the top and the side panels. No black. Also the item is quite tall. If you fill it too high, it will fall out of cup holder when you go around turns."
446160,0,"I bought this unit last week. I have a spin bike and I wanted this for when I watched TV, so that I would not just be sitting around taking up space. It does have a little movement to it, but I butted it up into the coffee table and it works just fine. It actually uses the muscles in the back of my legs more, where as the spin bike tends to exhaust the front of my legs. If you use this as additional exercise, you will not be disappointed. However, if you think you are going to scorch through some calories, think again. I pedaled for 30 minutes at a leisurely pace while I watched a Soap. The counter generously told me that I had burned a whopping 286 calories without breaking a sweat. This is so inaccurate it is not even funny. I wore a heart rate monitor and a BodyBugg. For those that are not familiar, a body bug accurately tells you how many calories you burn by monitoring 4 different areas, among them, heat expelled and body fat. The BodyBugg told me that I burned a measly 40 calories! That is quite a huge difference, don't you think? I think being off by 246 calories is very misleading. I guess what I am saying is do not buy this as your first line of defense against flab! It ain't gonna do it. If however you are looking for a way to add to your routine or just keep you occupied while your are doing seated activities, it is fine. It would also be great for someone who does not work out. It would be a good place to start, but it is not an aerobic piece of equipment."
105770,0,The coat fits me well. I have had several issues with the cheap zipper coming apart. My wife will install a much more durable one when she gets the chance. So I guess it's OK.
345718,0,I ordered X-LG but received M. I decided to keep them since they're terribly comfy and roomy.(and well-made) If they'd sent the right size then maybe a 4 star!
1427,0,"I buy compression shorts to prevent chafing and these did not do that. Like a lot of shorts I've tried they generally only work for 6-7 miles before the sensitive parts are starting to hurt (of course, the real pain is in the shower.)I assume they don't provide enough support down below and allow too much movement which leads to chafing.They're still good for non running. I can use them for normal trips to the gym etc."
320004,1,"As the title says, I've been wearing these for years, spring, summer, fall, and winter, every day, day in, day out!I live in the Pacific Northwest (should be North-WET!), and quite often have to work outside. I also like to go out in the woods, and I ride motorcycles up in the forest roads and logging roads. I do a lot of things that expose me to inclement and cold weather, and these socks get me through it every time.Wet or dry, my feet stay warm and comfortable. I've even worn these socks in 100 degree weather in Southern California, and in Baja California. Even though my feet were warm in those places, I was never uncomfortable in these socks. I also never suffer from foot odor, except for when I don't dry out a pair of shoes well after they've gotten wet.They last a long time, but I do buy then a dozen at a time so I rotate through over a long time. They aren't cheap, but I've tried other wool/wool blend socks, and they just don't compare to these... No itching, soft, cushy and loss of loft take a long time.I love these socks, and for anyone reading that has tried wool socks before, but didn't like the itching or the heat, try 1 pair of these, and you likely find they don't disappoint like others. Believe it or not, these are the only socks I own!Best regards."
496583,0,"The ball does not look like a real ball close up, it is hard to control, and it makes noise when it is moving. As a novelty gift, it might work, but to fool your buddies on the course, unless they are deaf, they will know what is going on immediately...still fun to see their reaction to the idea that there is such a thing as a remote control golf ball."
459376,0,"VERY SOLID BENCH ITS JUST VERY HARD AND ITS NOT REALLY WIDE ENOUGH FOR A BIGGER PERSON, IT'S MORE FOR A WOMAN OR SMALL MAN,"
385910,1,"I got my ball within the timeline given and I think it might have reached me earlier! The ball is amazing, i love it!! Thank you for great service!!"
308464,0,"I bought this product a few years ago, and could not start it for months. My husband got it started for me, and I needed him around every time I had to use the ball. Eventually he cut one of my daughter's shoe laces, and suddenly I did not need to call him everytime I wanted to use the ball. I have since purchased more of these Powerballs (but from another manufacturer whose product was better). This one started making noise, and stopped spinning as smoothly.For beginners, you need a string about twice the thickness of the string that is shipped with the ball. Once you get it started, there's no turning back. It has helped to ease the pain I get from Carpal tunnel syndrome."
203329,0,"While this is a quality thermous it seems very odd to me that they would not make the lid screw off and be used as a cup. This used to be the best thing about the old thermous. It just pops open and exposes a lip to drink from and the top just flops there uselessly.This is basically an overbuilt water bottle, it is not entended to be for hot drinks (the warranty on the tags even says ""Use with cold beverages only""). It seems better suited for ""chuging"" cold beverages from it.......but who wants to ""chug"" ice cold beverages? Also, even the ""chuging"" factor is bad, there is only one hole.... so there is no pressure relief from another hole, so instead of the water just pouring out nicely it ""glubs"" out.Bottom line: I purchased this to take coffee with me on cold days....and it works, but I really do not like the fact that I have to carry another cup around with me........wtf?"
105785,0,"The bike cover would be better if it's more stretchable. Right now, my bike has to be stored with the front and rear wheels aligning (i.e., straight). Turning the front wheel when storing will over-stretch the cloth, and it can rip. Okay if you store in a garage, but when you live in a small apartment, storing ""straight"" can take up space."
9826,0,"After reading reviews for different glove options I decided to go with this one and was quite satisfied during my first experience, but right in the middle of the 4th session (I play once a week for about 1.5 hrs.) the stitching in one of the fingers came loose (I can see the tip of my finger).While this hasn't severely affected the purpose of the glove it's quite discouraging that what seemed a well constructed item showed an important defect so quickly.I wonder if the rest of the stitching will also become loose soon.I'm giving it 3 stars because other than such quality flaw it provides a firm grip and materials seem of good quality."
120089,0,"The first one I received was DOA. Amazon was great and overnighted another watch to me which works. The second hand does not line up with the seconds and the watch just feels cheap. In short....Amazon great....Luminox, stay away."
433017,0,"In about two months they were A MESS.. Smelly (not my hands, leather smell) falling apart etc. I guess its time to get a new one but I d much rather buy a pair that LASTS. No need to buy a new pair every two months."
354915,1,"The Tiger Claw Feiyue Wushu Shoes are totally hot style. The soft rubber sole is great for sneaking up on unsuspecting people, and also for scaling walls.As these shoes are Chinese made (for Chinese) they do run a little small. I normally rock a 13 shoe, which can vary in European sizes from 46 (Birkenstock) to 47. The 47 in the Wushu shoes is a bit snug, but you probably don't want your feet all sloppy when you are sneaking up on people anyway, do you?Hot Style, and a great price!"
459420,0,"This is a good cheap pump just to get a basketball inflated. I would not want to use it frequently though... it's just a good pump to throw in your car so if you're at the courts and you realize the ball is flat, you have something to pump it up with."
467029,0,This ball is okay for practice or simple play. Another thing is that its volume is small than the official one.
97904,1,"I've had this for a year and a half now and I'm merciless when it comes to dishing out abuse to watches. This thing is tough and cheap compared to the rest of the G shocks out there. Stylish as a hockey puck, but if you're reading this, you probably don't care. One caveat for me was the alarm sound--not loud enough. Would prefer to use this for my daily alarm but not possible with this model. Maybe after a battery change that might improve, but if the battery lifespan is the same as my previous G shock (over TEN YEARS) I may never find out."

245283,0,"The shirt is well made, with even stitching and nice seams. The cotten is not as heavy a weight as I was expecting."
211569,0,"the pros are that the blocks are gorgeous and lightweight. the con is that they are glued together planks and I'm concerned about the longevity of this. I live in a dry climate so they may start falling apart after a few years... a traditional block is solid, something you can't tell by the deceptive picture on the product page. I have them now and they are the right size and seem to work so I'll keep them and see how long they last. However I find the hollowness disconcerting when moving them around and will likely look for solid blocks of hard wood in the future (not foam or cork)."
206865,0,"These shorts are very comfortable, and look great. The only problem with them is that they have NO POCKETS! I am a pocket-horder, so this does not work with me."
427291,2,"I bought a pair of these years ago and they worked great. When these arrived, they were super small and should be labeled kids size. I'm not sure who they think will fit these ""adult"" sized goggles. Was going to return them but my dog chewed them up."
419205,1,"I was surprised and pleased with the serious levels of resistance that are available on this solid, comfortable machine. As a stay-at-home mother with two small children, having the option to exercise in my own home has enabled me to maintain a much more regular workout schedule, and the Smooth elliptical is strong and versatile enough to give me a strenuous workout in just a few short sessions a week. I feel like this machine is a wonderful investment in my health, and the customer service and shipping departments were great. Everyone I spoke with was knowledgable, courteous, and followed through. I would definitely recommend this product."
96672,2,"I bought this item direct from ProForm. I should had known better than to be fooled again. The item worked for five months, and then the main pedal axel broke. Well, no problem I thought - I have the extended warranty. That turned out to be a joke. It has been almost three months later and the piece of equipment still sits broken. If they actually cared about their customers they would send a new unit out after the first time a technician couldn't fix it."

334112,0,"AN EAGLE SCOUT AT 12 YEARS OF AGE, I'VE BEEN AROUND POCKET KNIVES OVER 30 YEARS. BOTH &quot;REAL&quot; SWISS ARMY KNIFE MANUFACTURERS, WENGER AND VICTORINOX MAKE GENERALLY GOOD QUALITY KNIVES. THIS PARTICULAR KEYCHAIN KNIFE BY VICTORINOX IS NOT UP TO STANDARD. IT IS MORE ORNAMENT THAN TOOL. I BELIEVE SOME OF THE EVALUATIONS ARE REFERRING TO SWISS ARMY KNIVES IN GENERAL RATHER THAN THIS PARTICULAR KNIFE. I RECEIVED THIS KNIFE FOR MY KEYCHAIN AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT. AFTER 2 WEEKS OF LIGHT USAGE THE SPRING FOR THE SCISSORS FAILED. I STUDIED THE KNIFE IN GENERAL AND THE QUALITY IS JUST NOT AS GOOD AS THE LARGER KNIVES. VICTORINOX SENT A REPLACEMENT SPRING FOR FREE. IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY TO EXCHANGE THE SPRING.

THE WENGER KEYCHAIN KNIFE I NOW USE HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SPRING DESIGN FOR THE SCISSORS.IF YOU USE THE SCISSORS OF YOUR KEYCHAIN POCKET KNIVES, PLEASE CHOOSE THE WENGER...AT LEAST UNTIL VICTORINOX ABANDONS THIS CHEAP SPRING DESIGN ON THIS MODEL."
433437,0,"The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating was when I first opened the package at the campsite(My fault!), the zipper was stuck from the factory.As hard as I tried(and I'm a do-it-yourselfer) I couldn't make it work.The seller, Emergency Essentials was there for me though! They backed up the product and made it right! I would purchase from Emergency Essentials anytime!! They get 5 stars!"
35998,0,"This is a great camp for warm weather camping; as soon as it drops below 50 degrees, though, you'll freeze. The tent is extremely well ventilated and cold drafts get in unobstructed in the top and also at the bottom ground-level panels (which means you'll have cold wind blowing right on your sleeping bag!). This is with the tarp on and everything. Don't buy this if you need a tent for cold weather.Another complaint is that the ""sun roof"" window can't be closed! There is always a plastic see-thru window into your tent for anybody to look into! I had to rig a curtain with cloth and velcro patches. Very inconvenient.Otherwise, it's lightweight, brightly colored, and perfect for hot weather. Goes up in a flash."
147558,1,"If `Flexible Flyer' generates fond memories, you need a Mountain Boy Kicksled. Hand-built in Silverton, Colorado, Mountain Boys are designed to ride on flats or slopes, on packed snowmobile trails, snowy roads or even ice. The kicker controls the sled, steering from behind while standing with one foot on a metal runner as the other foot kicks the sled into action. The lucky side-kick sits in a semi-reclined wooden deckchair, takes in the sights and enjoys the ride. For the kicker, it's a great workout. For the rider, it's less bumpy than other sleds. For the soloist, there's the single model. Mountain Boy Sleds are an artful way to transport gear, groceries or kids. (Note: I first published this review in Ski Press Magazine)."

420427,0,"Id like to start by saying that the first 5 minutes after i opened the package and used this gun were some of my best ever. They were also the last. I was just shooting the gun, using high quality .20 bbs, when it made a noise like id never heard before. i unscrewed it, and on the inside was about $.50 of china's finest. Im not complaining, as it was almost a joke for me to buy this gun, being so cheap. Im simply saying that if you want an affordable, QUALITY automatic uzi airsoft gun, then dont look here.Other things:I know your curious, but do yourself a favor and dont take this apart!Works okay until it almost explodesThe folding stock isnt even worth it's wieght in Korean child labor,i just ripped mine offthe sight is only useful if your trying not to hit your targetThe power on this gun just makes me sad, shot myself with an entire clip, of about 100,and it tickled.My little sister agrees... terrible... shes 7 years oldPs.sorry to criticize this gun so badly, but im very cincere.

119031,1,"I am a regular fitness swimmer and go through the lycra suits every 4-6 months. They always get too stretched out and cause drag in the water. This suit is holding up beautifully with none of the usual snags and wear marks from getting in and out of the pool. Also, I'm usually a size 16, on the chunky side, but this suit looks good on me and fits well even in a size 14. Really glad I found it."
380496,0,"Directions and use are not particularly intuitive. Modes are written in font so small that it is extremely difficult to read: it is hard to determine if you are in ""Mile"" mode or ""Step"" mode because font is way too small. Would have liked a rotating clip to make it easier to keep the pedometer upright (which is necessary) when wearing. It would be great if you could register two modes of walking when guaging pace, one for exercise and one pace for normal walking."
16876,1,"I bought this product for my son on his 6th birthday. He loves it and plays with it frequently, which is the reason I bought it. However, I think it could be significantly improved with rubber wheels instead of plastic. I have a concrete carport and an asphault driveway. The plastic wheels just don't hold up and wear out fast. You can get replacement wheels, but it is a pain to have to do this when rubber wheels would extend the life of the toy dramatically."
276966,0,"This product doesn't have a 2.5 mm hex wrench, which is pretty common for bicycles. I would recommend finding a multi-tool that has a 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, and 6 heads with flat and Phillips screwdriver heads if you intend to go out biking with it."

305504,1,"This will be the second pair of the Native Dash SS I have owned. I purchased these to have a second set for when I returned my first pair to Native for warranty service.The glasses have been excellent. The only problem I have had is that the lens coating scratches easily. The glasses are light weight, comfortable and easy to wear. They take a little to adjust to your face, but once that is accomplished I forget I am wearing them."

170469,0,"If it were not so hard to get into the bag and to zip it closed, then this bag would surely be rated at 5 stars. Even though it is rather heavy even empty, that is not a deal breaker, because that goes along with a rugged go everywhere, do anything kind of bag. This is my daughter's school lunch bag and her insulated stainless steel Bento Thermos fits in the bottom compartment with room to spare and the top holds her juice, yogurt, napkin and fork, spoon and whatever else she might want to toss in.I pack her Bento Box and it is her job to get everything into the lunch box, zip it and put it near the door to be ready to grab as we head out. I can depend on groans and scowls and other grunts and outburst of frustration as she tries to close the thing up every morning. Occassionally she gets a good, smooth pull and that is such a simple pleasure for everyone. It is even hard for me when i must stop what i am doing to offer assistance. If I had to do it again, I would probably try to find a different bag, even if i had to sacrifice a bit on size and sturdiness, to get fewer morning headaches."
153510,1,Great for the person who doesn't want a full glove. Seems to be cooler to wear in hot weather.
470078,1,"Purchased this machine from Amazon 2+ years ago after using a Matrix elliptical at the gym and really liking the workout. Was a bit concerned about durability long term, as this is comparably a cheaper piece of equipment. But... have used it about 3 - 4 times/week ever since. Have never had any problems with it! Love the user memory -- just jump on the elliptical, pick your name and go! A great addition to any home gym."
343462,2,"That says a lot about the quality! My son took the ""grab bar"" and just snapped it out of the seat So much for a security feature.And it is very difficult to lock the seat on the track.

It appears that Timex has been aware of the problem for some time."
264695,2,"Was supposed to be a 45 cm ball. I don't see how. Even when I inflate it to as much as it seems to hold, it still does not measure 45 cm. But, even if it is (and I am doing something wrong), it is certainly not functional. The ball is hard as a rock. So, given it's size, makes it impossible to lay on unless you want to feel like you are pressing your abdomen against a rock. Worthless."
140013,0,"Unless I just haven't gotten into it far enough, this game is pure exercise. I haven't found anything ""fun"". If you are not in good shape, which I am not, it is a very challenging work out."
356481,2,"This company has extremely poor customer service. They failed to fill my order correctly, provided no packing slip/return information so I have to wait until Amazon allows the ""file a reimbursement option"" which takes about 2 weeks from the time you receive the order. I emailed the company and their response was spam mail thanking me for being satisfied. That's insult to injury. Save yourself the trouble -- buy from amazon but not from this subcontracted vendor!!!!!!!!!"
66340,0,"I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised? Does the value justify the cost? Does it improve my life? I put my recommendation at the top, then answer those three questions below.RECOMMENDATIONI like this hydropack for it's durability.FUNCTIONALITYThe protective covering adds a lot of bulk and weight, but being able to just cram it into a stuffed backpack with no fear of puncture is great. Camelbak's mouthpiece is one of the best ones out there (but there is more healthy competition on that front than there used to be back when hydropacks were a new thing).VALUEIt's a little pricey. Camelbak tends to offer less in terms of value than other brands. They were the original, but I don't think they're worthy of the premium.DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?The main thing is not having to worry about puncture in a tightly-packed backpack. You have to decide for yourself if the extra weight and bulk are worth it. I definitely prefer going the bladder route in my backpack as opposed to the bottle route. I hate how bottles stick way out on the sides. I like feeling laterally compact while I hike."
140779,0,when i first got it out of the box it didn't really work. suspecting a weak battery i replaced the battery and it worked slightly better. It seems to work ok but the screen sometimes looks funny (like all 7s instead of 0s). it works. it doesn't look like it's too durable so if you're looking for something you can keep for a while and/or use a lot i'd say spend a little more and get something else. some minimal use this is probably ok.
446783,0,Great! Product works well with my workouts. but the shipment and delivery were very delayed. Product came in a box and I had to put it together myself.

339050,0,"I like the design - it is easy to use and is well-built. I place it in the watch pocket of my jeans and it accurately records my steps. I am giving this product 3 stars instead of 5 because it spontaneously resets the day's data, on average twice per week. This problem may be caused by the reset button inadvertently being pressed, but the button is recessed and it must be pressed for a few seconds to do a reset. Hmmm."
119257,0,"I have a bike from the 1960s with original Schwinn parts and flimsy p clamp the mirror came with would only fit thin handlebars. I ended up asking my local hardware store to drill a larger hose clamp. Works great on cruiser style/ north road handlebars. It takes a little adjusting the angle and tilt of the mirror so you can see the cars next to you. Not really adjustable on the fly besides angling the mirror up and down, but I think that is the case with most bike mirrors."
354758,0,"I was wearing the minimus from newbalance and was looking for a minimalist shoe and stumbled upon this. For about twenty bucks this is definitely worth it, but you can tell that you paid quite a bit less by the quality and durability of this shoe. The price is the best thing about this shoe, it isn't very stylish, and it feels a bit cheap. I wear a 10.5 in the US, so I thought a 44 would be a pretty good guess at what I'd wear but I should have gone with a 43. I scrunched up a paper towel in my shoes to make up for getting the size too big and it fits much better. Definitely worth the buy at $20, but don't expect anything close to the other minimalist shoes."
258567,1,"I use the Boresnake Bore cleaner for all my firearms. They are durable effective and make cleaning out the bore super fast.

396961,2,"I love the feeling of cork grips, but they just don't last. These are harder than average. It's funny, people reviewing these say to shellac them. What the hell? That pretty much defeats the purpose of having these, well, unless you just like to look at them. If you're gonna shellac them, you might as well carve your own grips from a shovel handle... I can't even imagine how well they would work wet or sweaty palmed. Probably quite slippery.So...Get these for the looks. If you want a trail worthy grip go for foam."
366950,0,"It's just a short. Quite mediocre in quality, hence the 3 stars. I didn't have high expectations for this short since I was trying to meet a minimum total for an offer and I would only use it to lounge in. The material is a bit more rough than expected. And the red is much brighter than in the pictures. The only major issue I may see for others is the discomfort that may be caused by chafing by the inner elastic band."

483808,1,"I am an athletic 48 year old woman with bad knees. I have bone on bone arthritis and have had multiple injections to both knees with limited improvement. I have had to ice my knees after every exercise I do, either walking, riding a bike or doing a cycle spin class. I was unable to do stairs. I was frustrated with using ice packs and having to prepare them daily. I found this on AMAZON and it is now my daily go to item. I strap it on my knee for 10 minutes after exercising to reduce inflammation. I then place it on the other knee for another 10 minutes. This 20 minute routine of icing after activity as kept me going so I can continue exercising everyday. Even after I have my knee replacement, I am sure I will use the Neo Wrap and highly recommend it to anyone, any age who is active or plays sports. You will not be disappointed with the results."
217693,0,"Be very patient or my advice is to just pay someone else to put this thing together. You do really need 2 people and at least 3 hours, the last steps getting the backboard with the adjustable height mechanism together were a little unclear in the directions and took us quite a bit of time. After all is said and done can't get the hoop level, it's kind of tilting up. Otherwise good value for the money and seems to be relatively well built and sturdy."
133667,1,"It's exactly what I needed. It was a little more expensive than others we were looking at, but for the very light construction, compactness after fold-down and easy of putting together we're happy. Our other trailer has protection bars at the wheels and the wheels attach like a regular bike. I wish it had this setup. The wheels are quicker and easier to install and it's narrower after it's folded up since it doesn't have the wheel guards (which I think are useless anyways.)"
507151,1,"Being that I am doing a lot more book reading these days, and need to read at every opportunity, I turned to Google to look for a book holder-opener to use when I am on the treadmill (having misplaced the other doodad I was using). The first product to pop up was the a cool little book holder called the FlipKlip. The FlipKlip is manufactured by BlueZap in beautiful C'oeur d'Alene, Idaho. The owner of the company is Bob Begin, also known as Mr. Wizard.The premise behind the FlipKlip is to keep a book open when you are engaged in activities where two hands are not necessarily available - such as knitting, typing, cooking and exercising. Eureka - the treadmill - perfect!Recommended places to use the FlipKlip (as cited on the BlueZap website) are:* On your computer desktop* Reading bed* In the kitchen (perfect for holding open a cookbook)* On the bus or train* On the airplane tray table* At Home* At the Gym* At School* While Eating LunchI have been trying out the product for a couple weeks, and it has proven to be quite useful and durable. I am getting a lot more reading done, and it encourages me to get on the treadmill, where the tendency (or excuse?!) may be ""I need to read; I can't spare this hour on the treadmill."" The FlipKlip kills two birds with one stone! I have used other gadgets over the years, but the FlipKlip tops them all!I appreciate the fact that it's a perfect size, and, when not in use, it can be clamped onto the book for safe and easy portability. It comes in a variety of colors: Ortega Green, Deep Charcoal, Twilight Purple, Sunset Pink and Aruba Blue. And, best of all, it is manufactured in the USA!The FlipKlip was generously provided to me by Bob Begin at BlueZap for review purposes.Reviewed by Andrea Schultz - Ponderings by Andrea - [...]"
23699,0,"The product itself is pretty nice. I like that you can size it easily. However, it gets stuck on the back of the bike seat and falls down over her eyes. Also, because it gets stuck on the back of the bike seat, the straps chaff her neck. I think it will work better for when she is a little bit older (she just turned 1) and taller than the back of the bike seat."
86137,0,"I purchases the bally slimmer belt with zippers about 3 wks. ago. I am a size 10/12. I am able to zip the belt to the 3rd zipper which is not too snug. (I have a belly). While it is zipped, the belt loosen up and and I can no longer feel the effect. The zipper pinches my stomach and have left 2 marks. I know wear the belt on the out side of my t-shirts while working out and on the outside of my slip or bra top while at work. While wearing the belt at work when sitting, the belt later crinkles up. I was looking for a belt that would HOLD my stomach in while working out as well as sitting for about 6 hrs. at work. This belt is good for running or walking but, it will not secure your stomach the way you want. Touch decision if I would recommend this for you. You will need to purchase the belt to see if this is the one 4 u. Thanks."
339543,0,"Simple and easy, but with that, a couple of things cause problems. When setting this, you must set all entries at the same time. If you want to change the person's weight or the time due to daylight savings, you must reset everything. Just Annoying. Also I am small and have a small gait. This pedometer is limited in how small the gait you can set. For me it is an 1.5"" too big."

221221,1,"I used this stove during a 2-week car camping trip to several national parks. My companions and I love the stove! It heats fast, and is easy to set up, take down, operate, and clean up. It handled multiple daily use very well and was extremely reliable. Heating a cup of water for tea took a minute or less. I only heated water or cans of soup myself, but one of my party was from Indonesia and made delicious spicy fried rice from scratch every night. Once in a while, one of the burners didn't ignite with a press of the red ignition button, but it would light with a match. I would use this stove at home on the patio when I want to stir-fry or deep-fry something at high temperatures without having the house smelling of cooking oil. This stove is now an essential component of my camping gear. Highly recommended!"
417080,0,"First off, I like and respect the folks at Century. Their products are innovative, they are always working to improve them, and they care about customer service. I bought BOB because I was tired of some of the flaws of my Wavemaster bag, and because BOB just looked like fun. He was. He offers a surprising amount of resistance, so he helps you develop your power, and he offers targets for those exotic shots: head butts (careful), throat strikes, eye gouges. But . . . I hadn't had BOB for even two years before I started to literally tear his head off. Now, I am not a young man, I am not a big man, and though I have martial arts training, I haven't put my fist through any brick walls lately. I didn't even work out with BOB every day. But I figure a couple more sessions and I will have completely decapitated him. A crack extends from his chin to the back of his neck on the right side.His noggin flops around and the stuffing flies out with every strike. I liked BOB as a training tool, but for the money, he should last longer. Caveat emptor."

I would definitely purchase the white lithium grease with the machine and grease all the moving joints liberally. Ours squeaks at times and I have taken it apart to add more grease for my sanity. I put it together by myself and it took around an hour or so. Don't get me wrong, it is heavy and you might want help lifting the box that it comes in. Delivery was great. The drive helped me carry the box into the house and down to the basement. ***** stars for him, his communication before delivery, and being on time. My wife likes the fact that it does not take up a lot of space and is easy to use. I like the fact that it is sturdy for me at 215lbs. I can run on this unit easily. I do have a concern about the foot pads that support your feet. See cons below.Cons - the fact that the foot pads feel a little flimsy like they may break in a year or two as the plastic ages. Minus one star because of the squeaks that can usually be taken care of by adding more grease to the joints. In my case, I greased the joints when I put it together and then had to take some parts back off and grease a second time. As other users have stated, be careful to not over tighten the bolts as this might contribute to squeaks."

They fit her a little shorter than pictured on the manaquin (why don't they use real people in these pictures?), and so they didn't meet the requirements.Material is just your basic, thin stuff. But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her. I'm glad they are now using a read model. They held up for a few months before they ripped. They served their purpose."

I figured I would get a medium in these to accomodate for bulky clothing underneath. They were really short in the torso and were pretty tight, so I had to go up to the large size. They are good pants, but the sizes are all wrong... I would recommend trying different sizes to find the right fit."

Amazon had a couple options and we selected this one based on my past experience with Giro bike helmets. I ride a lot and these helmets are some of the best out there and their customer service has always been great. The helmet provides a great fit for my daughter and is infinitely adjustable. It doesn't seem to bother her and she actually goes over to get it when she wants to go on a ride and cruise the neighborhood. Well made and excellent protection.

147944,0,"This is a cool knife. I bought the Zytel-handled version, sight unseen. Normally, I insist on handling a knife before buying it. I made an exception in this case because I just liked the look of the it, was somewhat swayed by the enthusiastic reviews, and the price was reasonable enough.The good:* very sharp* very cool-looking* strong liner lock* opens as advertised--fast using a pocketThe bad:* totally impractical for everyday carry (EDC)* sharp edges poke you when worn in a pocket* can't move the pocket clip (lefties are out of luck on this one)* if you are even slightly klutzy, you have to practice opening it or you can seriously hurt yourself while deploying itWell, I was warned about all of the above before I bought it and I still had to have it. I am happy with my knife. It's not an EDC, but it's a nice addition to my collection."

476056,0,"I purchased this umbrella 3 weeks ago b/c the gustbuster umbrella's were more expensive. Based on the 6 reviews, I thought I'd take a chance at the $16.99 price point. Today, I used the umbrella for the 1st time and I could not figure out how to open it. I did not find the normal button that opens most umbrellas. In the location where the button would normally be located, I found a metal dimple.I thought the umbrella was missing the plastic button that would press down on the metal dimple. I was wrong. After many failed attempts using a wrench to try and press down the metal dimple, I gave up. That's when I noticed the metal hinge. To open this umbrella, you have to press a piece of plastic down into the metal hinge in order for the arms of the umbrella to open. I'm quite certain that the terminology I'm using to describe this process is wrong. However, the main point of this review is to try and explain that this umbrella opens without a button. I'll probably get used to opening this umbrella by pressing down on the piece of plastic. I just need practice as my initial attempts have proven cumbersome and I really need to press hard on the piece of plastic in order for the umbrella to open."

397992,0,"I bought this product through Amazon, because I was using one already, and really liked it, but the ones I ordered, while from the same company, were not of the same quality as the one I had. The plastic bottle parts broke and leaked after only a short time, and the spouts were a hard plastic rather than a soft one like my original, nearly broke a front tooth! The outside covers were very similar to the original, and seem to work as well keeping the bottle cool. I would not recommend the new version of this product, but if you can find one that is of the original quality, buy it!"

342635,0,"Ok, I bought 3 of these because of the awesome reviews. I know I couldn't have received three bad ones. First this takes D batteries which is fine except they did not make the battery closure strong enough. Every time you walk around the battery closure once in awhile comes open and out goes your batteries as the closure is at the bottom. The 2nd and final problem is the lamp shade has the attachment where you carry the lamp around...well they did not make the piece strong enough so when it's snapped into the holes, the top piece comes disconnected. Meaning, you drop the lamp then the batteries fall out!! Ugh..these were only $8 each but not worth the hassle. Great if you want to just leave it on a table. I must say now that I read ""table lamp"" it may be my fault"

This is a solid product that works as advertized."
495637,1,"I'm very pleased with the way this watch looks and feels on my wrist. It's the perfect weight - substantial, but not overly heavy. The band molds smoothly around the curves of my wrist without any pinching between links, so it's quite comfortable. The matte-finish looks a lot like titanium at first glance, which makes it seem like a much more expensive watch. In sunlight, the band looks just like the photo, but the two-tone effect is very subtle when indoors. Unless I look closely, all I see is the contrast between matte and brightly polished finishes instead of two tones (maybe that's because the gold is very shiny, and the bright/matte contrast is stronger than the color contrast?). I first saw this watch in real life with a dark blue face and thought it looked great, but I like the gray face on this one even better. It looks like brushed stainless steel under the golden hands and time markings and makes for an understated mono-chromatic appearance (the watch face in the photo is much darker than the actual color). The watch looks good with just about everything I wear (suits for work or cut-offs and a bathing suit for play). But, you won't want to attempt any covert activity at night, because the glow-in-the-dark REALLY glows. My one gripe is that because of the pretty way the bezel tapers, there's not a good way to grip it and I wind up doing a push-and-twist sort of action (like opening a medicine bottle) when I want to mark elapsed time. The motion is a bit awkward, but manageable. All in all, I'm happy with this purchase. I feel like a got a high-end watch at a low-end price."

155225,0,"These DVD's take a very long time to get going. After a couple times, you will want to skip past the very long instructional introductions.

100218,2,"I bought this watch as a back-up when surfing. It supposedly has a 10 yr battery and is water resistant to 330 feet. I purchased it in July 2010 and I used it once or twice and noticed the time was off. I set the time and checked it a couple more times. It worked intermittently. I read the warranty from the Casio website and this appeared to be a manufacturer's defect since I hadn't done anything to it that should have damaged it or voided the warranty. I shipped it to the Casio service center in NJ for repair or replacement. I received an estimation letter indicating it was out of warranty and it would cost me almost as much to repair and return it as it was for the original purchase through Amazon. Needless to say, I've deemed this watch far too low of quality to justify spending any more money on it and this experience will definitely affect my choice in purchasing watches. Fortunately, there is a plethora of manufacturers that make low to mid-range sports watches so I won't have to only deal with Casio."
70076,0,"These cleats work very well for walking on ice and packed snow. However, I found them difficult to adjust and fit. The toe straps don't work well with pointier (such as my running shoes) shoes and slide to one side unless really tight. The ankle straps have to be very tight, too. If the straps aren't tight enough or aligned properly, the sole is too loose, slaps a bit, or the shoe slides off - annoying when one is out and about. I prefer the Kahtoola MICROspikes for fit and ease of wear."

Returned it for a rull refund and now I'm not sure what brand to buy. I don't want to spend much more than this as I won't be using it often (just to sight in my AR15 now and then). I'm still giving it 3 stars though because the look and feel of it seemed good and because others have reviewed it highly so the lens must be pretty good.

I now know how the dog wearing a cone feels.Padding is cheap. It's white and feels like thick double sided tape without the adhesive on one side.Bottom line: These work. For sure.

I did not check the size of the tent. When I saw 10'by 8' four person two room tent, I figured it would be big enough. I did not get to spray the tent & it rained inside. Make sure you know the dimensions, don't be fooled by 4 person 2 rooms. There is not a lot of room to get around."

213579,0,"I was in the market for an inexpensive watch that had a 200m water resistant rating and was solid built. This watch fits those requirments, however, it has some shortcomings. The good part is it is a very nice looking watch. It also seems to be keeping accurate time so far. Some reviewers have complained about the band being flimsy, I think it is solid and goes very well with the watch. One of the bad aspects of the watch is that it has very little reserve time. If you don't wear it all day, and you take it off when you go to sleep, as I do, chances are you may have to reset the time in the morning. Another annoying thing is the bezel rotates way too easily. Anyone who is serious about scuba diving and is considereing this watch should reconsider. The band does not expand to allow for room if wearing a diving suit. Most serious diving watches have this feature. The most annoying thing about the watch is you can't wind it, so you either have to wear it every day, or reset the time when you want to wear it. Other reviewers complained that the watch does not have a hacking feature (freeze the second hand to set the time). If you set the watch a minute ahead of the correct time and allow the second to reach the 12 o'clock position, you can apply some back preasure on the crown and hold the second hand in place. Just release the pressure when the correct time occurs. I like the watch for what is is, a masculine looking watch that looks more expensive than it is, and one I'm not afraid if it gets beat up because the price is right."
120265,1,"A really bright rear light that gets you seen. It comprises of two rows, each of 5 LEDs. Each row works independently and can be set to any one of 4 modes - either flashing, constant, side-to-side or random.It comes with fitting for the saddle post and a clothing clip. My saddle bag covers the saddle post so I used the clothing clip to attach the light to a loop on the back of the bag. This was ok for a little time but then I discovered that the lamp and the clip had both become detached from the bag and had been lost - no doubt when going over some bumpy ground. I'm now on my second lamp and have used a cable tie to ensure that I don't lose this one as well."
347963,0,"Pros: It's comfortable, functional, stylish, roomy, matches my boyfriend's and sure seems durable!Cons: There's only 1 mesh beverage pocket, which is ok, except that it's on the right when you're wearing it--made for 90% of the population & I'm in that other 10%. Also, wish it had a key clip in the smaller pocket like the other ones b/c I'm always digging for my keys, which always hide at the very bottom somewhere. The airlift straps like those on a few of the other Jansport styles/designs would be an awesome addition."
223865,0,"Pros: Looks fantastic, shoots fairly well.Cons: The highcap mag is trash, It doesn't load 1/2 the time, the small mag runs out of ammo to quickly. The gun feels like very cheap plastic. It likes to Jam up and not shoot pretty regularly, you have to pop the clip out to get it to fire again. The power is a bit low compared to the other low end guns on the market. The scope is an absolute piece of junk...The plastic in mine was so poorly made you couldn't even see thru it.Overall: for $30 its an ok gun I would suggest spending $50 and getting a DPMS Panther its a much much better gun(I bought a panther at the same time I bought this gun)I bought this gun for my 6yr old son to target shoot with. He loves it, I wish I could say the same."

239144,2,"I just fitted this to my 998xt rack. It fits fairly well, and feels pretty secure. It's well made, and comes with all the accessories you'll need.The downside is that it's impossible to get my shaped skis (Rossi Bandit B3s) into the rack the way they suggest (back to back). They do fit, but less securely, as individual skis. This reduces the capacity to 3 pairs of skis, and not 6.Also the height of the rack, even with my relatively short skis, is insane - the tops of the skis stand a good 2 feet above the roofline of my SUV.To be honest.... I wish I'd bought a roof rack, and just stuck with the Thule rack for my bike."
494481,0,I bought this earlier in the week. I was attracted to it because it would work on my car (Thule crossbars) and my wife's car (Yakima crossbars).It turns out that you need extra parts for the rack to work with a Yakima rack and they are not included with the rack itself. This is something to be aware of if you have a Yakima roof rack.
66748,1,"I've been getting these for several years. I started using them for sailing at night. The red light setting does not damage your night vision or blind your crew. As a skipper, its just bright enoug to read charts in the cockpit or to venture forward safely for a headail change. Makes it easy to navigate around snoring crew and find that snack in the galley without using a ridiculously bright flashlight or burning precious amps on the house battery and waking everyone up with glaring white light. The white light option is always there when you need it - to see tell tales on your jib or main. May you never need it ... but the white light option is also great when you have to contort into the aft locker to locate a thru-hull leak or jury-rig a repair to your steering system. Nice to have a light that always points where your eyes are looking! Toggling between the two is a sinch, even with fully-gloved hands.Recently, I've been using this on planes to read, see the keyboard on my laptop and to navigate my bag in the overhead. The red light is significantly more kind to your sleeping cabinmates than the overheads - which never seem to point where you want them to. A little goofy looking to have a light on your head - but hey, you're in economy anyway. Savor the utility! Might as well be comfortable and control what little bit of your environment that you can control on those 7-14 hour flights. Paired with noise-canceling headphones and a personal water source, you'll be fine!I'd imagine these are great for all kinds of other things like changing tires at night, walking or running at night in unlighted areas or against traffic and Watergate-style political B&E;."

145515,0,"I have bought OnGuard u-locks in the past. Each one has come with a mount and the locks themselves have provided good, secure, locking. My girlfriend's bike was stolen twice in a short span of time using lesser locks, but since getting her an OnGuard u-lock she's had no problem for a couple of years here in NYC.The previous locks came with a plastic clamp-like mount. You would wrap some rubber (included) around the post you wanted to mount to, then tightly bolt the plastic clamp to the post around the rubber. The result was a very snug mount. I had relatively few issues with this mechanism.I just got for my new bike and wanted a nice new lock for it, so I got this one. They have changed the mount. Now it's a plastic mount with a seatbelt-like strap that you wrap around any post of your bike and use an allen wrench to tighten until it's snug. The advantage I suppose being that it will fit around posts of any shape. Sounds good, but in practice it's much worse than my old mount was, and in the span of just a few weeks the plastic part of the mount has scraped up my new bike due to the slight wiggling it does (weight of the lock it's holding + riding over bumps = enough wiggling to mess things up). Also, the other day I was riding pretty fast and hit a pothole. The lock jumped out of the mount entirely and skidded across the middle of an intersection. It didn't break, a testament to the lock's rigidity I suppose, but still it was extremely inconvenient and unsafe. Had the street not been deserted this could have caused all sorts of problems.And one other thing, my previous OnGuard u-locks have been the larger ones. This compact one is more secure and lighter and better in most ways I think, however the included security cable is not able to be wrapped a few times, then intertwined and locked into the u-lock for storage as was possible with the larger lock. As such I have to carry the cable in my bag since there's not really a good way to carry it on the bike.Despite my displeasure over the mount situation, I would still recommend this lock. Even with this worse mount, it's still a great value. And many people may not use the mount anyway. But for me, the unreliability of the mount (which, lacking a better option, I do use despite it's sucking) makes me knock it down to a 3 star product."
29292,1,"A good strong bike lock at a very reasonable price. The D\U lock fits around my rear tire and the pole I'm locking it to easily, and doesn't leave extra space for a thief to get leverage. The cable is nice and thick, and while it's not as strong a chain-link, it's more than enough to secure my front wheel.I have not used the included mounting bracket, but it doesn't seem too great."

The diet is tasty but is mainly a high protien/ low carb diet. And sorry Tony, you're cheese ball at times!If you have any joint issue do not spend the money. It is not easy to modify. Otherwise it is a fantastic workout. And get your own bar. The one P90 sells is not ergonomic to grasp... maybe thats what happened to my hubby."

391807,2,"I purchased this watch to replace my low end Polar, which gave up the ghost about a year ago. I did some research and was happy with a few of the reviews I read - chalking up the few bad reviews to bad luck or expectations that were too high. Well, first off let me apologize to those I doubted.This watch STINKS! It works occasionally at best. Oh it was fine the first month after I figured out that when it's collecting data you don't have a choice but to have it display the current heart rate (a minor hassle). You can, however, toggle to average, max and time but it won't stay on those, it goes back to heart rate.After about two months of nearly daily use it began acting up. For instance - I was rock climbing outdoors and after an hour and fifteen minutes it just shut off. I went to turn it back on making note of the time and calories (which is one thing that sucks about this watch, it doesn't keep a record of any past workouts) but it wouldn't go back on. I tried repeatedly to turn it back on but it wouldn't start. Then suddenly after a few more climbs I heard the watch beep. In my surprise I checked and lo and behold it had been on for a whopping one minute and twelve seconds! I burned 7 calories in that time : )Last night while rock climbing indoors, while I was belaying my partner the HRM stated my heart rate was 30. My heart rate isn't 30 when I'm asleep. And today I went for a relatively hilly seven mile bike ride - I am not used to the big hills so admittedly I was huffing and puffing. When I got home I looked at the HRM it stated my max heart rate was 110 - which I doubt since my heart rate could have been checked from someone standing three feet away.The biggest thing that attracted me to this HRM was the fact that I can change the battery in the chest strap - I couldn't do that with Polar and thought it ridiculous that I'd have to send it back to them to get a new battery.Okay, after all that, do yourself a favor and spend some extra money on a good HRM, this one just isn't worth it."
247616,0,"This rail is awesome, but the problem is that the foot pieces don't connect snugly enough with the leg pieces, which means than the whole rail will wobble a bit when you ride on it....which is scary/dangerous.To fix this, I had to drill my own holes through the legs & feet and use a bolt and wing nut to actually SECURE the legs, then I filled the remaining space with something like plummer's goop to eliminate any room to vibrate.If you're willing to do this, you'll transform this into the most kick-ass rail in town."
434971,1,"I own two of these Thermarest Compressible Pillows. I take the small pillow backpacking. No more smelly rolled up pants etc. for a pillow. I have a Medium pillow which I take car camping. They both loft up wonderfully if you unroll them as soon as you get to your destination. If towards morning you want more loft, just flip it and drift back to sleep. It is by far the very best backpack pillow I have ever tried! I have hiked 600+ miles on the AT."
44669,0,"I've had my C44 about 2 weeks now, and while I'm happy with it, I think I wish I'd waited until I could afford a better model. I've just started a weight loss journey, and I thought a treadmill would be a good investment given Alaskan winters.Things I like about my C44:It folds, thus taking up a small footprint of floor space when not in use. Rough estimate without measuring, you'll need a spot about 3' by 3' to store it when you aren't using it. The lock that holds it closed is sort of hard to release, which I think is a huge plus, as I babysit a toddler.Quick-stop key (probably standard on all treadmills)....it clips to your belt or waistband, and then inserts the other end into the treadmill. The treadmill won't turn on without it, making it handy to take with me when I leave the house, so I have no worries about my children playing on it.It seems sturdy. I'm not lightweight, in fact, when I bought it, i was just a few pounds under the 250lb weight limit, and it doesn't strain under my weight when I use it. I have personally used it to speeds of 3.5mph. My husband, about 200lbs, and athletic, runs at speeds up to 7mph and it, and it doesn't strain then, either.Incline: it has MANUAL inclines of 3%, 6% and 9%.What I don't like:I use a Polar F6 heart rate monitor while I walk. I start walking on the treadmill (which starts the clock on the C44), and then I start my F6 monitoring. When my workout is over, my F6 ALWAYS has more time logged than the treadmill does. I've tested my F6 against stopwatches, and it appears to be dead on, so apparently the timer on the treadmill doesn't keep good time, which frustrates me, and makes me wonder if it's tracking the mileage correctly.The thumb sensor for heart rate monitoring: it's horrible, no two ways about it. It jumps all over the place, within a span of about 2 seconds, it will measure my heart rate at 83, 144, and 199. From what I understand, all sensor type heart rate monitors are fairly poor, but I've also read that they can at least give you a close estimation of your heart rate. This sensor aboslutely CANNOT do that. If you buy a C44, definitely invest in a chest-strap heart rate monitor for accurate monitoring, don't rely on the treadmill's sensor.The incline: Being totally new to exercise (ie, I've never purposely exercised in my life!), I thought it was great that the C44 had 3 levels of incline, and that would be perfect for a beginner like myself. Well, walking on a treadmill is not the most exciting thing I've ever done, and I've found some awesome treadmill workouts online, to vary things up a bit, but unfortunately, they all require incline use, and the C44's incline feature leaves much to be desire in that aspect. In order to adjust the C44's incline, you must turn off the treadmill, fold it up, and then manually adjust the leg height. Most treadmill workouts do sequences such as 2 minutes at 0%, 1 minute at 3%, 4 minutes at 0%, 2 minutes at 3%, etc. By the time you get off, adjust the incline, and get back on, you've lost your heart rate and just about the time you get it back to the targe4t zone, you've got to hop off and adjust again.So, my advice on the C44.....if you can possibly afford a better treadmill, then save your money a little longer and get something better. If this is absolutely the best treadmill you can afford, get it. it DOES work well, and is certainly better than nothing. Even though it has it's flaws, the C44 HAS given me the motivation to get off my rump and get moving."

I noticed it right when I took it out of the package so I don't know how this could have been overlooked. Obviously careless employees and cheap merchandise. What you can't see in the video is that the arms of the sunglasses won't even fold down all the way since they are also uneven. They guarantee authentic non-defective merchandise but the Sunglass Express did not live up to their own standard. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. You've been warned!"
162435,2,"I bought this to replace a 10 year old Polar Heart Rate Monitor that finally kicked the bucket. I figured that this would work pretty much the same way. It didn't. I read the directions and tried it again. Still couldn't get it to work. I bought a new battery for the strap. It still didn't work. I re-read the instructions, thinking that I had missed some important detail. It still wouldn't work.If you want a good Heart Rate Monitor buy some other brand. If you need just a watch this will do the trick for you, but you can find one cheaper than this."

252742,0,I've had two of these now & although they work great they don't last long. One a fan part broke in it & rattled around & the other just overheated & died. The hose is the most irritating part & if you loose this miniature clip it will continue to vibrate off. So then you have to keep the hose on the unit with one hand & the other on the valve to blow it up. Not fun. They typically last me 1-2 years of blowing up a few pool toys. The round design also makes it difficult to stabilize if you aren't holding it. A flat bottom works better. The only good part is that it does blow things up quickly.

155634,0,"I bought this watch several months ago, and used it a couple times. It was a little loaded with features, which made it confusing for the basic exerciser to scroll through the HR, Calories, and Exercise Time menus. The thing I liked least about it was its huge size. It looked like a man's watch on my arm, and since I wanted to wear it daily as a watch, it was not very attractive. I did end up returning it to the store and purchasing another Polar model that was more basic and easier to operate. Polar makes a very good product, but having to send them away when the battery dies is not acceptable. I just end up buying a new one. Polar's bands have a problem with discoloration from wear, and by the time the battery dies, the watch is a little beaten up from daily wear, so paying for extensive reconditioning (like $60) is usually not worth it when you can buy a new one for $80."

480835,0,"I have been wearing these yoga pants for 6 years now, I swear by them and will not buy anything else. When I first started wearing them I'm not even sure if any company made anything quite like these, now there are hundreds of the same type pant. I still buy hardtail because i know how they fit and the quality, I wouldnt want to waste money trying something else out. However, these pants only last a year before ripping in the inseam in the upper inner thigh, also they fade a lot (I recommend not drying them and letting them air dry). While the quality and fit is most favorable, these pants are going up in price every year, I just spent $80 on my last pair I bought at Nordstrom! These pants used to cost $50 and if you wanted some design they would cost no more than $60. I am very disappointed in the fact that they are raising their prices so much, especially when they only last a year, if that. I guess they may be raising prices due to the fact that people are moving away from this brand because there are so many other companies carrying a similar product for much cheaper, but if they keep raising the prices they're only going to lose more customers, not to mention some of their loyal customers."

405284,2,"This rolling rack is a hassle to use and really unstable.First, there's zero resistance in the wheels so if you nudge the rack while putting your bike in, it'll roll away from you; easily fixed if you just step on it while putting your bike into the rack. Second, most bikes tend to lean a bit while in the rack which means you have to spend some time balancing the back of the bike to make sure it's stable. And third, after you've done all that, a slight nudge will send most bikes tumbling over.I wouldn't mind the slight hassle in putting the bike into the rack if it were stable... but it's not. There's not enough adjustment in the rails so skinny tires lean really far over even on the narrowest setting (maybe ~10 degrees). Fat tires are either really loose or really tight depending on their exact size. In either case, when you combine the friction-less wheels with the lean bike, the whole thing gets unstable. It doesn't take much to cause the front to roll a bit and then throw the whole bike off balance. Crash! Boom! Dang, now my I have to readjust my seat... oh and my spoke is bent.Since the rails are really low, it puts pressure on the spokes. I don't think this will affect the bike when it's upright, but if it falls over, it can pretty much put all of the pressure onto a single spoke which will can cause the wheel to become untrue if you don't realize it until for a couple days.This rack might be fine for kids bikes or other low-center-of-gravity bikes that aren't too heavy... but for high end road bikes, and adult mountain bikes, heavy cruisers, hybrids, commuter bikes, or recumbents, go with something else."
466663,0,"The knife is true to its description. Very small build that makes it very versatile and compact. The blade is not as sharp as some of the reviews have described. My biggest complaint is the difficulty in opening the knife with one hand. For the sake of ease and convenience, one of my biggest determining factors is the ability to open the knife with one hand. The small size makes it perfect for storage, but that's exactly what makes it hard to open. Opening the knife requires the use two hands, and a nail -- and even that technique is difficult. If the blade itself had a small grip on which to pull, then the problem would be entirely solved. Overall, i'm disappointed with the STL's design."

I find this lamp perfect for my use, giving some overall ambient light to a room and even for reading with it is held up close to my book. It lasts a good two hours per cranking (about 2 minutes of cranking) and has been reliable so far. I have bought two now (I find them useful as I said) and would not hesitate to buy more. If you need a compact crank lamp with modest light output (for a tent, small room, or reading in bed during and outage) I dont think you will be disappointed with this product. highly recommended."

422815,0,"First off, I like the socks. They were what I was looking for and had a good selection of colors. I even got a compliment on the field. The problem is in the protection offered by the sock. I use baseball socks to protect my legs during a slide in to a base. My last pair did this well but broke down at the foot of the sock so that my toes went through. These socks had the opposite problem. The toe area held up but when sliding in to second base, my leg got seriously busted up. I may have slid hard, it being the beginning of the season, but this open gash is similar to one I got last year when I slid in to second without any socks at all. I expected more protection than a marginal difference between socked slide and no-socked slide. (See uploaded product picture for details)"

449125,0,"[I give 3 stars as an average of 5 stars for the tires and 1 star for Amazon and RealCyclist]I just got a pair of these. One from Amazon and one from Real Cyclist via Amazon. Both are supposed to come with a free tube according to the manufacturer and online reviews. Both should also come with a 'guarantee card' for a 1 year warranty. Neither did. Both were just tossed into a box and shipped bare. Both were implied in the Amazon description to be folding (which may be changed by the time you read this). Neither were folding. That is the bad part. The good part is that they easily fit by hand onto both Bontrager Select and Bontrager Race Lite wheels, and both look to be very nice tires. They are very narrow for being supposedly 28mm. The width by calipers in fact is about the same as 23mm Pro3Race tires! I have not ridden them yet. I will update the review when I ride them - but be aware that Amazon is keeping the free tube that Conti provides with each tire as is Real Cyclist and that these are WIRE bead NOT folding. Continental the company provides the free tube with each of the tires, and the tires costa bit more on account of that, so it is a bit crooked that the customer who pays for it never sees it.UpdateI have ridden them a bit (90 psi rear, 75 psi front seems best for 175 lb rider and gear) and they definitely are pretty smooth rolling for their weight and tread. The center tread (nearly slick) helps a lot with this and on smooth roads they are quiet and plenty fast for a touring/trecking tire. I can't speak for longevity. As one would expect, they do feel a heck of a lot different in handling from tires like Pro3Race (which I ride mostly), but after about 10-20 miles you begin to get used to them and all is fine. I have yet to try on gravel or dirt hardpack, which is a big reason why I am trying them out.Update 2I have since gotten a pair of the proper folding version from benscyle (.net) an online bike shop. The wire tires weighed 459g and 458g while the folding weigh 380g for the 700x28 tires. I have seen it stated elsewhere that they are 410 for wire and 350 for folding for this size, that is clearly wrong. The folding goes on as easily as the wire bead, so rumors that they are harder to get on than the wire are not true for the sets I have here. The folding clincher from benscyle was only $5 more than the ones sold at Amazon here pretending to be folding but not. I would recommend getting folding from benscyle and not getting the ones sold here. The benscyle people were friendly on the phone and had them in stock and I got them in about 2-3 days time shipped via priority mail."
168538,2,"I have three problems with this outdoor ball:1. The ball is clearly designed for durability but the result is a ball that's too hard. Unlike many indoor/outdoor balls this one has absolutely no cushion. It's made out of hard rubber that might last forever but is no fun to play with.2. The ball is too rough. Many reviews cite the ""excellent"" grip that this ball provides. Although true, the grip is so rough that it's not an exageration to say that it will seperate your finger nails from the tips of your fingers if you don't catch a pass in just the right way.3. This rubber ball has way too much bounce to it. It's reminiscent of those Voit bouncy balls used in school yard playgrounds, just 5 times harder.In short, spend a few extra dollars for an indoor/outdoor ball. The grip might not last as long but the overall quality of your balling experience will be much improved."
393246,1,"I've read and heard on an instructional video by Pavel that men should start with a 35lb kettlebell. I don't agree with this at all, because one must get used to using one in the first place. If you run out and buy a 35lb kettlebell without getting used to a lighter one, you could seriously hurt yourself regardless of how strong you are. Technique is very important. They are not just like using dumbells because you have to make sure your back is straight and that you squat properly when swinging them.I purchased this 26lb kettlebell and practiced the basics (i.e. swings, get up, clean and press, snatches) and it definately gives me a good workout with just a moderate number of reps. As a martial artist, this supplement's my training so it's not the only thing I do. After using this for a little over a week, I notice a difference in my kicks. Most of the exercises like the one-armed snatch strengthens the glutes, hamstrings and quads so they are very valuable for conditioning the lower as well as the upper body."

298361,0,"It's a ridiculously cheap yoga mat - don't go having high expectations. It's a relatively sanitary layer between me and the floor, and not much else. I perspire easily and practice Bikram yoga, so it is decidedly slippery on its own. I expected that, but not for my microfiber towel to slide all over it, even when damp, which was never a problem with my Jade mat. (It's a great mat for vinyasa ,but the open-cell mats absorb every drop of sweat you can produce, which is disgusting.) It doesn't weigh much, and I haven't had any curling up issues with it. It does stick well to the Pergo floor in the studio. It didn't even move during Triangle!The high point of this mat is that it didn't smell, even fresh out of the box. I unrolled it, wiped it down with soapy water, per the instructions, then took it to class, and there was no appreciable odor. I intend to buy a better mat in a few weeks but I will keep this as an alternative mat for practicing outside or toting on vacation."
369934,1,Received this seat Promptly & as Described + Pictured. My wife rides her bicycle about 12 miles every other day & this seat has her no longer complaining about an aching butt. She is not over-sized & the seat fits well; it has obviously done what was hoped for.
258358,1,"I have used these speed loaders for years with a Taurus 851 concealed hammer and stock rubber grips. The rounds go in smoothly, but need a little jiggle to shake them down into the cylinder. They are what they are for the money. A little practice with them and you can get reasonably quick. I have never had a problem with them and I routinely carry two of them loose in a pocket. If you carry them loose in a pocket, make sure to check the pocket you carry them in for lint and foreign matter, as well as the speed loaders. If you want competition fast, this one isn't it. But it is an inexpensive tool for reloading a revolver faster than 1 round at a time."
90835,0,"Pros: cheap, holster fit some of my guns, comes with a beltCons: poor stitching on some parts, and doesn't fit some of my more unique pistols. Also the magazine part of the holster is a bit too short to hold any full size mags securely (can't close the Velcro over the mag) straps are not elastic so not great for runningWell 15 dollar for a 3 piece holster is a great deal. Unfortunately the second day of use I accidentally tore the holster part of the pistol right off the rig. Not too upset though because to the price I was not expecting anything of amazing quality. It would be great for a costume though."
35989,0,This item was way overpriced for what you received. The sizeing chart is off. They wear a 3 T and it is huge. They might be able to wear it next summer. I wasn't over excited about the fabric either. I have other rash guards and this isn't the same. Disappointed.
423146,0,"Ok, so as long as you don't require these tubes to be ""circular"" after inflating them, then you'll be fine. When they are filled with air, there is an obvious flaw with how they are molded, glued, whatever. It folds up in the shape of a taco shell. The hard kind of taco shells. Maybe not quite as extreme as a fully folded up hard shell taco shell, but thats the direction they try to go. Now they are still useable, but they are a bit goofy to manage and it just feels wrong to sit on a tube that is folding up and somewhat wrinkled. It just seems wrong."
409128,1,"When you put this bench together, if you have assembled other benches, the first thing you will notice is that it is a walk in the park to put this together level. The metal is of high quality and very scratch resistant. The cushions and material hold there comfort for a long time running. This is my second BowFlex SelectTech bench. I had my other one for over a year and when my roommate went off to his military career, he took the bench with him and I immediately purchased a replacement. When your holding hundreds of pounds over your head, you don't want to fear your bench will collapse beneath you, and it wont. The build and design on this product is solid, each adjustable angle is just as solid as well. There is also an attachment, not included in photograph, that comes with the product. It is a leg attachment that goes on near the seat that lets you lock your legs in for extra stability, but the product can be used without it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable bench to beef up there home gym."

127245,0,"I have now used 3 types of mirrors for my road bike for both commutes and long tours:Take A Look mirror, theMirrycycle round ""mountain bike"" mirroron the bar end, and the Sprintech bar end mirror for drop handlebars.Short review: I like Mirrycycle the best.I bought the Take a Look mirror based on the strength of reviews from Amazon and I was a little disappointed.One strength I was expecting from the other reviews was being able to always see behind me no matter which position I used on the handlebars and without having to move my head like when you look down at the bar end mirror. This was kind of true, but you had to get your head to the same angle. I found the angle for the top of the bar to be very unnatural in the lower grips. It was impossible to tilt my head up that far on my bike with aero bars. In order to see back and to the left while on the brake hoods I usually had to tilt up and twist my head and when down on the lower grips I had to tilt WAY up and twist. You can't check behind you without moving your head because you have to do a lot of sweeping motions to see all around behind you and those are more uncomfortable in the lower positions.I used Take A Look for a couple weeks commuting every day and doing long rides on the weekend and I sort of got used to sweeping my head around to check behind me, but the deal breaker for me was that most of what I saw while commuting was my backpack. When you have a backpack full of clothes and in a pretty leaned forward road bike position what the mirror sees looking back past your ear is back pack, even when on the top of the handlebars. If you are riding a more upright bike (hybrid, mountain bike, or others) it probably wouldn't be a problem. It also wouldn't be a problem if you had panniers (won't work for me because I have a large laptop that would make panniers severly unbalanced). It was fine on the weekend rides without a backpack.I found either of the bar end mirrors (Mirrycycle or Sprintech) to be better than the Take A Look. The Sprintech is nice because it is convex and shows a wide area. Some people see that as a minus because it is hard to judge distance, but you shouldn't use the mirror as a substitute for looking behind you, just as a way to alert you that a car is back there somewhere and may warrant a head turn look behind. You can also get good coverage from the mirror from all handle bar positions, but the mirror is a tad small. It doesn't stick out far from the bike so it doesn't get bonked around storing the bike, but your knee can be in the way sometimes.The Mirrycycle ""mountain bike"" bar end mirror is the best in my opinion. It goes fine on road bike handlebars. Since it's flat you have to compromise a little bit on the position or move your head a little to see behind you from the different grips, but there is no distortion like a convex mirror. It sticks out from the bike so you can see behind you without obstuction at all times. The downside to sticking out is that when you are entering or leaving the lower grips on the drop handle bars it is a little in the way of your left hand. It's not a big deal. Also when you want to lean the bike on anything the mirror is in the way. It's an annnoyance I don't mind putting up with to have the best view when I ride. It's big so you get a good viewing area. I guess it's not very aero dynamic, but lose some weight and gain some muscle and you can overcome that.All three mirrors have to be adjusted everytime you ride. There is no set and forget mirror. The Take A Look itself holds position well on the ride, but your glasses never seem to fit exactly the same everytime you put them on and pretty much anything you do with them once you take them off will change the adjustment. This is even worse if you want to take the mirror off and use the glasses between rides (without looking like a dork). Take a Look also takes lots of little adjustments to get right. Sprintech mirror is flimsy and loses adjustment easily, but is also the easiest to adjust by a long shot. You just slide your hand down to the end of the bar and adjust it with your pinky as you ride, takes 2 seconds at most. It's convex and covers a wide area and the mirror doesn't move very far so it's never very far off from a good adjustment. The Mirrycycle mirror is stiff and holds position really well once you set it, but since it sticks out from the side just about anything you do to move or store the bike readjusts it. It takes a little more fine tuning than the Sprintech, but less than the Take A Look.Of the three I prefer the Mirrycycle mirror."

480564,0,"This combo seems well made, but the acrylic backboard is just glued to the supports without any mechanical attachments like screws or bolts. Within a few months the backboard started separating from the supports. If you have a way of preventing that, it's a good system."

93191,0,"Hi all. I bought this lantern and fell in love with it. I used it for one season, packed it away and alas, as many of you have said, it no longer works. As I read the directions and reviews here, I opened the battery cover and took a look. I suspect the battery is dead and herein lies the problem.Contrary to the directions, I would suggest NOT cutting the wires. The battery can easily be removed by pressing the small tabs on each contact and pulling the wire off the battery. Might be best to use a rubber handled tool to prevent shock. But, the battery IS replaceable and can be purchased online here or at Radio Shack for approx. $12! No need to junk the whole thing.That doesn't make up for the company's complete lack of regard for it's customers but at least it's not a total waste.I hope this helps someone."

236969,0,"I purchased this pull up bar about a month ago on amazon and it is working alright so far. The bar is sturdy and can hold a lot of weight. When I was installing it, it did not fit in the first doorway I tried - make sure the part of the door frame you are putting it in is at least 2 and 3/8ths inches wide. If you are using it for multiple exercises such as pull ups and then sit ups, (with brackets by the floor) beware the bar is very difficult to put in and take out of the brackets."
144815,2,"According to the information on the website, these socks were listed as being 79% cotton, 20% stretch nylon, and 1 % spandex. When I received them, the label on them says they are 67% cotton, 17% acrylic, 15% nylon, and 1 % spandex...this is not what I wanted. Also, they are very thin and run small. I am disappointed and will not buy socks again online."
291464,0,"For the money, I would have liked a product that does not ""sweat"" when the contents are cold. Some condensation is to be expected, but with the stainless steel, it is profuse. I have to let the bottle sit until it gets closer to room temperature and then wipe it down - several times. This is not convenient if I want to use it on the go. I also wish it was easier to drink from. It is difficult to hold in the little button to release the air while drinking. It is not entirely necessary to do so, but the squeaking noise it makes if you do not can be a problem in public. I decided not to return the bottles I ordered, but I would not order them again."
221207,0,"Stove unlike our tent, performed pretty good. It heats VERY quick and we are happy we went with this model-lots of hot water quickly which is what we wanted-even boiled a large pot fast for corn on the cob!The only problem we had is when the burners get wet from rain, the auto-lighter doesn't work. Lighting manually with a lighter results in burnt fingers due to layout but otherwise, a great product and one we would recommend."
506208,0,"I was excited to get the bag to help keep my golf stuff from being all over my trunk. Overall it works well, however took some extra work by me to make it functional. The bag has lots of storage, however, the divider for the top compartment was put together backwards and the Velcro on a few sides did not line-up. I was able to buy some Velcro strips and fix it myself. The lower compartment is too low and the sides and are not very sturdy and would not hold itself up. I like the other reviewer used a couple of golf ball sleeves to fix the problem.Ultimately, the bag does what I wanted it to; it was just aggravating that I had to come up with solutions to fix the problems, as calls to Samsonite were not helpful."

29846,1,"This is hands down the best saddle made and a 150 years of making them they got it down right. Once you get it dialed in you will wonder why you ever used any other saddle on your bike. No road vibrations, no pain in the butt, nothing but nice and smooth. How does it work? It's kinda like sitting on the head of a drum. The saddle flexes over every bump in the road and after a time it starts to form to the shape of your sit bones. Comfortable with no teeth rattling ride. Hand made in England and not rolled off some assembly line in China so its worth every penny."

280371,2,"I bought this item, looking for an adjustable jump rope. I have owned an adjustable rope before, and was assuming that by ""adjustable"", you can change the length of the rope multiple times. Not so with this rope. You are able to change the length one time... and once it is at a shorter length, you are pretty much unable to get it back to the longer length. I will look for a truly adjustable rope and return this one."

78983,0,"The bike carrier works Okay, but the rachet straps slip and do not allow it to be tightened down very well. This leads to the whole unit moving around. It is quick to get the bike in and out of it though. I would suggest looking at different options before buying this unit."

215229,2,"the polar manuel is either outdated or talking about a different watch. the settings are very difficult to set as well as bring up onto the small screen. it appears to be made of some cheap give away watch and is so difficult to use that once you complete your Ph.D, you should be able to get to page 9. once at page 9 you will wonder why you got there in the first place. this product is not what is suppose to be, easy to use and user friendly are not what it is."

313723,0,"I just got it, so this is somewhat preliminary, but: while the ingredients include many good things, there's also the usual garbage: propylparaben, methylparaben, two kinds of alcohol, colouring agents, and fragrance (not strong, but persistent; initially even pleasant, but since it never goes away, it becomes quite annoying soon thereafter). It is also quite greasy, I'm not sure why people say it's not. What it isn't, is wet, but you gotta understand that it's not because it is absorbed into the skin: nothing gets absorbed into the skin this way; it's simply the alcohols in it dry up (the usual effect). I'm somewhat disappointed, I must say. Make sure to check out the ingredients before buying; don't go by the positive reviews here. I'll use it a while and see what else I discover and will update this review then.Added on 10/28/2011: I tossed it in the garbage. Smelly, sticky, greasy, to hell with it. Five-star reviews are pathetic, probably all of them fake. Btw, I finished my researches into moisturisers, and the results are somewhat anticlimatic: the best moisturiser for face is L'Oreal's aftershave; the best all-around moisturiser is Cetaphil (both lotion and cream; I like the cream better but both are fine). Everything else I've tried isn't quite as good (even though it was all two-to-four times more expensive). Go figure. L'Oreal has all the usual crap including parabens in it; Cetaphil is pretty harmless (no parabens, no fragrances, no grease: a pretty neutral product), but not too natural either. Yet these two are the best."
63216,0,I purchased this to take to my yoga classes but it is too heavy to lug around so I returned it. If you aren't planning on carrying it somewhere or don't mind the size and weight it might suit you. It just wasn't for me.
253188,0,"It has mostly done its job admirably, with two exceptions. One time my ID came flying out while running, which I didn't notice for several blocks. (This was really my fault, so I'm not grading off for that, just giving as a heads up.) You have to make sure the loop is pulled taut under the laces or this thing can flip up while running, emptying the contents of the ""wallet"" area. Unless you stare at your feet while you run, this is not noticeable immediately.Second time was something wrong with the unit. The zippered compartment somehow came unzipped as I ran down the street. Luckily my key bounced on the street so I was able to hear it and stop, but if I had been on grass, I'd not have known until I tried to get back into my house. To prevent this I now zip the unit up and pull the nearest lace through it before tying my shoes. Works like a charm, nice and secure.But the zipper issue means I have to mark this baby down."

The only problem is that the assembled mallets don't fit in the carry bag, and the threading for the screwing the mallet together is delicate enough that removing the pole once it has been threaded is probably not a good idea. Other than that, the croquet set has been a huge hit. We've got a nice little course set up in the back yard and the kids are getting quite good at it. We've just had to use a different bag for storing the set."

54557,0,"This is a nice quality helmet, and my daughter loves the pink. It's not too metallic and shiny - more like a satiny finish. She likes the 'skateboarder' shape of it (unlike her round bicycle helmet she had outgrown). The straps and padding are nice, and unless it gets thrown around a lot, it seems like it's going to be pretty durable. We give it three stars instead of four because of the fit. This is a very, very round shape. She has a round head, but even on her, the helmet has gaps on the sides, and presses on her forehead slightly. On my more narrow head, it was extremely uncomfortable and wobbled from side to side. She says it's not uncomfortable on her, so even though I probably would have sent it back and tried for something with a better fit, she's happy with it and doesn't complain about wearing it."

166337,1,"I've had this tent for a little over a year now, and have taken it out camping about 8 times so far. With the exception of one trip we've gotten rained on every single time. The last time we went we were out in the open (on the beach) with 20-30 mph winds and heavy rains for most of the night. I've never done any additional waterproofing and I have never gotten wet in this tent. It sets up easy, even in the dark, and easily fits 2 adults and their essentials (change of clothes, water, etc). A good tip for setting this tent up is to make sure its set up with one of the sides facing into the wind, because if it rains the fly will offer the most protection that way. One thing I would like would be a little more privacy when the rain fly was off, but overall I have enjoyed this tent. It has kept me warm and dry from March-November in Pennsylvania."

All in all, it is a terrific bargain at the price I paid (~$27).So why only four stars? The five exterior pockets are designed for magazines - one per pocket - and that's about all. Here's my suggestion. Cut the number of magazine pockets to two, but deepen them so they can carry two mags each. Then used the saved real estate to put a wider, longer pocket for general purpose use.But hey, I quibble."

I got my Bones 2 and needed this part to attach it. This part does what it is supposed to, but the Bones 2 IS NOT for the Mini. It is a tripod. On cornering, there is not enough support for this rack to hold bikes firmly in place due to one upper arm, and two lower. Oh well. The hatch huggers do their job, although a pain to install, you have to pull them out of their ratchet clamps as they are too thick to fit in the hole of the hatch/to/roof opening. too much tube, not enough hole. I wish I had that problem."

72056,0,"The utility of this item should be obvious to anyone contemplating it's purchase. For those who haven't examined one, these observations. The handgrips may not provide enough space for your fingers. The fingers of my moderately large hands feel uncomfortably crowded when using the ball, perhaps to the point of being harmful with long term use. The ball is much firmer than the other medicine balls I have used. With gripless models you generally do not have to worry about dropping the ball on yourself or bumping it into your head. You won't want to do either with this one. Finally, this ball smells like a new tire. If you enjoy sniffing new tires you will enjoy this ball for a long time, for the smell does not appear anxious to fade way. That said, I have used this product to good effect."

With a little carving the striker came out in just as good of shape as it came out of the package.i also stuck a mule deer with one. hit a rib on the enterence, and still passed through like paper althou it did put a ding in one of the blades. not a big deal as replacement blades are like $6. He ran about 10 yards layed down and was out.g5 has made me a beleaver of the reinforced tip, and i would incurrage anyone looking a drop an elk to give these a spin. There durable, and accurate."
349631,0,"My wife and I have each had two previous iterations of Mizunno Batting Gloves (most recently the original Techfire). Tried this glove when our old ones wore out, mainly because we hadn't found any batting gloves we liked in local stores, it was reasonably priced, and available for prime shipping. It is an alright glove but seems more cheaply made than our previous ones. Neither of us liked it enough so we went ahead and ordered the newer version of the Techfire despite the extra cost."
58154,0,"Seemed to be a good, inexpensive watch with atomic accuracy. It crapped out after about 18 months. Display & hands were mismatched, re-linking didn't help. It had been beat up, scratched crystal & broken pin on the band (glued the band to the case, worked fine), both issues reported by others. Oh well, not a big investment."
292431,1,Great water bottle. Very sturdy and doesn't make the water taste like plastic. I wanted a Kleen Kanteen because a lot of my teammates have them and are very happy with it. I am happy with it too. I ordered a metal top separately so there is no plastic leaching whatsoever.

456314,2,"I've used this pak for about 6 weeks now and am very frustrated with it. The elastic strap increases the bounce which is the last thing a runner needs. A side effect of the bounce is that the pak becomes loose so, as a result, constant adjustments are needed as I run. It's constructed well and may be great for hikes and such but it's not for runners who want a bounce free run. My solution - I cut the strap off and replaced it with a non stretch strap. Now it works as good as my wife's pak - no problems."
29692,1,"This product is exactly what it says it is, but for a better price than most every where else. I bought 2 and may come back and buy a couple more later."

324737,1,"I have only used the grill once because I just got it a couple of weeks ago. But, I love it. This grill has a large cooking area. I had like 8 to 10 Ka-Bobs on there are one time. I have seen some reviews that said that it got to hot in the center and did not cook evenly. I think this is partially true, but it was not a problem for me. You can always rearrange you food while flipping sides and so on. I have no complaints about the grill. Can't wait to use it again! Tailgating this weekend!"
198897,1,"I'm not sure why there were complaints about the difficulty in programming. I did almost all the programming without consulting the directions at all, and this is my first pedometer watch.

39048,0,"My husband likes this style for his lap swimming. Speedo has changed the stock number, so it took a while to find the new number. Also, Speedo must have changed the dye process, because it starts to fade after one use in the pool. Current versions only last about two months at three times a week use."
259952,2,"I bough these clippers wanting a very good set of cordless clippers. I thought that is what I would get because of the price. I use them on horses. I have a old set of $60 clippers and wanted to get something better. These oster clippers are slow, vibrate, and make noise which isn't good for horses plus they don't cut good in heavy leg hair. They keep stalling. My old clippers that are worn out do a better job. Don't buy these expecting to have a professional set of clippers. They are over priced by a factor of 3."

180521,0,It is not what I expected at all. I have another fleece that I paid alot less for and it keeps me warm. This is paper thin. Disappointed in this columbia jacket
173701,0,This scope was a little disappointing. I know it is only $29 bucks but I thought it would be made a little better. It feels like it is made out of plastic.
182826,0,"Light, and quick drying this is a decent suit for a casual swim. One caution is that it lacks ample room for those with bigger, beefy thighs, thus the first time I wore them I felt tightness and left ""redlined."""
496570,1,"The item arrived quickly. It's perfect for my daughter and I'd recommend it to friends. She's probably the only basketball player to wear one, but that's ok, if it protects her head from another bone bruise."
436062,0,My friend & I loved this tent except one pole gave out the 3rd time we set it up and the material on the door side was sewn too tight so we couldn't use the tent clips on the poles. The zipper would have failed. Wish it would have worked out because we loved the ventilation and overall design of the tent. Maybe we just got a bad one.
51461,1,Love that there are two different bands with this watch and it costs less than the bands on other sites.
460314,2,"This holds very little - very thin. Maybe a sandwich and pair of gloves - nothing else.Also, when the water bottle (which is a bit over a pint I think) is full, the weight is not carried comfortably.I think it's nearly useless."

66954,0,Because I am someone that is bigger I was of the opinion that that 3xl would fit that way that I like ........ although the fit is ok I just thought that it would have a little more room in the shorts being a 3x...... otherwise good shorts
72848,1,"Nice material and color. Washes well BUT,,,,it was soooo big!Guess it just runs full. I would not mind ordering another color but will obviously go smaller."
11356,1,"The Bulova Marine Star chronograph is a nice quartz chronograph. I've had it for about 10 years now. It has a solid case, polished links and is water resistant to 100 meters. it's got a beautifully detailed ivory face and Roman numerals. It's got three blue sub-dials for the chronograph for the sub-second, minutes and hours. My one glaring complaint is that the hour and minute markers are very thin and hard to see, especially against the blue sub-dials."
341912,0,"Unlike the photo provided, the rear wheels of this cart has width of approximately 2.5 inches each. Although the cart folds and has a small form factor, the humongous wheels almost negates this advantage.I had a hard time putting this cart into my trunk. Plus, the thicker wheels picked up too much dirt and grass. The cart was also hard to manuever.So I bought an extra pair of ""thin"" wheels which Bag Boy sells for their other push carts (all Bag Boy push carts use the same thin wheels except for this one). The pair of thin wheels cost me an extra $36.Now, since the wheels are much smaller (1 inch each in width), it nicely fits into my car's trunk, doesn't pick up extra dirt and grass, and doesn't fight me when I am trying to change directions.I still would have given this cart 4 stars but most of the Bag Boy accessories, such as its umbrella holder, does not support this particular cart. It seems this cart is an orphan among Bag Boy products."
49014,1,"I've had this knife for close to six years now. It has stayed razor sharp through lots of use, good for whittling wood. It's small but nice for a its size. Ideal for a person's first knife or for a boy scout. Not a new knife owner but a collector of many buck knives, hammer knives, case knives, scharade knives, CRKT, KaBar, and various other brands throughout my life and for the price it is nice and small but a pretty good rounded little knife."
431537,0,"The apron is OK, a bit small, so it won't work for a tall or large man. Came quickly and except for the size is fine."
273614,0,"I like this watch, but I bought it to ""time my workout"" as was advertised that that was a function of the watch. I thought that meant it would have a stop watch feature, which it doesn't. You can reset the seconds to zero, but unless you know what the time was when you reset to zero, you can't time a work out.Also, as most of the cutomer reviews have said, it was incredibly hard to program. I followed the directions step by step and it took me awhile to finally get the programing to work.On the positive side of things, it is an atractive watch and comfortable. It does look like the picture of it on the internet. It received in a short amount of time (I think 3-4 days after ordering). I do like that it's indiglo feature."
469225,1,"It is a very sturdy rod, works well in the barrel and because of the material you dont have to worry about nicking the bore. If you clean your guns very often, this will be a benifit for you to have. I bought this product at a great price, the seller said it had a blimish , I havent found it."
499545,0,"My reason for the low rating is the condition in which the watch was received from Jewels Warehouse. 6 weeks after lodging my complaint via Amazon and with the company direct no communication has been received back which means to me they cannot be bothered with after sales. I would definitley purchase from Amazon again, but not Jewels Warehouse purely based on the condition of the watch and the non existent after sales service."
140284,2,The leg strap and and also the cheap flimsy resistance band are awful. You have to assemble the resistance band. The loops on the resistance band are too small to fit my hands in. When using the leg strap in falls down my leg. There is hardly any resistance at all in the resistance band. If EA improved on these two things it would be a decent product. Maybe put a real resistance band in the box?. I'll stick with a real gym for now...
13225,1,"Super easy to install on the GP100-just depress the standard plunger and insert. The kit came with more replacment lite pipe options than I expected (white, yellow, green, orange, pink) in addition to the red. I will probably only replace it with the green, but its nice to have more to test out.I left the red in and it instantly pops when you acquire your target. the height of it felt slightly higher than the standard blade sight on the GP, but the measurements look exactly the same....only time on the range will tell.Overall appears to be a great product - cost was reasonable as well. Amazon Prime is the best."
28326,1,needed somethin to just mix up after workout drinks. needed a bigger mouth at least 8-10 ounces and durable. this is great.
419124,0,The only problem is I think they run just a little smaller than other athletic shorts in the size small.
93433,0,"These are very warm but after wearing them for only two uses, one had a hole in it. I would expect better quality for the cost of them, but they are still a good winter sock."
263077,1,"At first i was sceptical about this shirt, but when i tried it works like it is supposed to do. As a beginner snowboarder i am taking falls very often and this shirt is performing really well! It absorbs much of the damage and i do not feel almost anything. It offers protection for the ribs and the whole arm (from shoulder until just before where the wrist is). It is very confortable and after a while you are forgeting that you are wearing it. The only downside is that it has a particular smell that it does not seem to go away. I have washed it a couple of times and there has been some minor improvement :) This is a must buy for beginners and not only."
267638,1,"The Velcro strap does not hold the mirror securely, but tightly wound black duct tape has secured my mirror perfectly for five years."
413452,0,"Pros: Thick and sturdyCons:1. Not preshrunk - either buy two sizes larger and wash as usual or ONLY wash in cold with AIR DRY2. Buy some needle and thread, all the buttons need to be reinforced.3. Looks best after ironing otherwise a wrinkle-fest"
149332,0,"The one size fits all doesn't work. The edges of the cups press against my big old man ears and this hurts after a while; intolerable for use on a flight, of no importance if you're wearing these for a few minutes at a time while making some power saw cuts. Also the range of height adjustment allowed by the frame isn't quite enough for a larger head. Maybe my head is outlandishly big, I don't know. It could very well be that I'm not even fully human, but the product of genetic mixing with an extraterrestrial race of giants with huge brains."
18576,1,"Have used it a couple of times. Ice lasted for at least a couple of days, until we used it up. Just what we wanted. Received promptly and in great condition. Thanks"
107522,2,ordered these after the other see-thru mounts I received lacked the right mounting screws. opened these and...missing screws. there are suppposed to be 8 long and 4 short. Included were 9? long and 0 short. there is no way for the long to work on a Winchester 94 because the threads holes in the actual rifle are very shallow. Contacted the seller to get the right screws sent and they said they would get right on it...TWO WEEKS later I received the screws-2 short and two long!? Unbelievable. So now I'm left with cutting these very small screws off somehow since I replied to the last email they sent telling them of the problem and have gotten no reply. More frustrated than I can communicate. I do however realize how hard it is to count to eight and four and for the replacement it would be hard to see the difference between 1/4 and 1/2 inch. I have concluded therefore that they are using chimpanzees to sort screws.
96752,2,"I bought this for our boat. First it blew a fuse. I could not find any where what size fuse to to put in it. Called their support line and got the answer. Then the plug keeps coming out of the adapter. Bought a different plug and wired it up, worked for a few days and now it does not cool or heat? It did at first with the new plug. I would not buy this unit ever again."

20985,0,"I took this thing through Europe with me, and I have to admit that it was convenient. My sole reason for purchasing this travel pack was to have the option to throw it on my shoulders to free up my hands for other things. To that extent, this was a great success. But be warned...the straps on this bag leave much to be desired. They were uncomfortable and literally dug into my skin. A typical backpack has more cushion in the straps, which was very surprising considering the capacity of this pack.Outside of the discomfort, this is a very good bag. It seems to be built well, has plenty of room, and makes traveling a little more convenient."
434617,1,"Received a week after ordering, packaged well. It weighed about 180lbs so be prepared to have help moving it around. Easy to assemble, although you need to pay close attention to the instructions. Make sure all of the same color jersey's face the same way AND that the controling handles for the same color are on the same side of the table.Doesn't come with self leveling feet, you have to insert shims into the boots on the bottom of the legs.All in all, the kids are having a ball."
22549,0,"I bought this as a safety device, to make myself and my kids more visible to cars when we ride at night in the neighborhood. It's works well for that function. My only complaint is that it is somewhat difficult to mount well onto handlebars. I can't seem to get it mounted tight enough so that the entire unit doesn't rotate about the handlebar, so my kids are constantly adjusting the light so that it's not pointing at the ground but instead pointing forward. However, I do like the fact that the light has a quick release function, so that it can be removed from the handlebar mount, in case a flashlight is needed, and easily replaced onto the handlebar mount."
309831,1,"taste? nah i don't care about the taste, no matter what brand they are, they all taste the same to me, as long as it doesn't taste like the faucet water from my house or school, is fine with me. I don't have high standard when it comes to a bottle of water"
482999,0,"I bought this to use with my Nikon Trailblazer ATB 10x50's which have a compact frame. It does fit, but doesn't HOLD them very securely. I am primarily using this for big game hunting out west and if I have to set up looking down at any angle I worry that the binoculars might slip out and fall into the canyon! I will continue to use it, but it's not a good permanent solution to a universal tripod mount in my opinion. I wish they'd just put a middle strap in front so that it would be impossible for your binos to fall out..."
108734,0,"We purchased the Bell Classic Bicycle Child Carrier based on its reviews and as an economical choice for our almost 2-year old who will only get about 1 year's use from it.Now that it is on and we have test driven it, we like how he fits in it, and we feel comfortable with the safety it provides. It is nice, but not exceptional.But getting the seat on....Suffice to say that, as best as we can determine, this Child Carrier is made to attach to a road bike and not a hybrid bike, like ours (a Trek 7000). Our frame is thicker than that of a road bike, so attaching the seat to the rear fork was just barely possible with the hardware supplied. It was possible, but squeezing the brackets around the fork so that they were close enough for us to even begin tightening the nut took a lot of muscle! We also had the same problem as another reviewer, in that our bike has a quick-release seat, and does not have the kind of seat post bolt that the seat needs to be attached. We were able to remedy that by removing the quick-release mechanism, going to the local hardware store to purchase a 1/4-inch hex bolt (which fit in our bike's seat bracket), and using that instead of the provided 8 mm Hex Bold.At one point in our construction of the Child Carrier, we got particularly frustrated, and tried to find some customer support. There was a 1-800 number, which was closed on the weekend, and absolutely zero on-line support. I have gotten used to having some sort of on-line resources available to me, even if it is only a copy of the owner's manual, so the absolute lack of *anything* was very frustrating. (There is plenty of information for Bell bicycle helmets, but nothing for the child carrier.)So bottom line, if you have a hybrid bicycle (or, heaven forbid, a mountain bike), be aware that it might not assemble as easily as it should, and you may need to make an extra run to the hardware store!"
349784,2,"I purchased the Harbinger Push Up Bars from Amazon. I like the style and the fact that they are low to the ground and have very comfortable grips. However, the bars are made of plastic and are not as sturdy as they appear in the photo. As for usability, they are fine for doing normal range push-ups. However, when I attempted to do wide range push ups there was entirely too much strain on my wrist joints. I may end up purchasing a sturdier rotating set in the near future."
163368,0,"Good mask, a very good quality rubber, only thing i was disappointed was it didn&#8217;t come with a drinking straw or canteen as advertised."
391227,1,Read all the reviews and decided to purchase this Timex brand--five years ago I bought the more expensive POLAR chest strap/heart monitor watch and it cost a fortune to have the watch battery replaced. My new Timex chest strap is adjustable and does not chafe or itch (I'm all girl at 148 pounds). Easy to use and the enclosed booklets regarding new research on establishing a maximum hearty rate were an extra bonus.
233225,1,"We have two of these that have lasted 8 months and are still going. We did have one that went outside and that was the end of it. Once in a while we'll fill them with helium, which the kids love. If you have a large room for them to throw them around it, they'll love it."
319788,1,"I purchased this ball for my 10 month old son who loves to ball with balls. He LOVES this ball...it's become his new favorite! He can bounce it and he does this over and over and over again...We play catch with it where we bounce it back and forth to each other but he quickly turns away and just likes to bounce it on his own. Best $$$ I've spent on a toy to date!Oh, and the ball is super cute!"

82642,1,"These are very nice shorts. I know this because I bought the exact same ones at a department store. But the ones I bought here on Amazon were really small. I bought a small size, which is what I usually buy for all of my shorts, and it ended up being as tight as my spandex volleyball shorts. I would've gone with two sizes bigger if I knew."
477840,0,"This is the CN-10 model made in Korea and available from several distributors under their own name. I used it for many crimps and it worked OK. The handles are spring loaded to open, which makes lining up a crimp much easier and the stroke was smooth with little effort for me, but my hands are a little stronger than average.However, after a while it developed a slight ""grab"" in the compression stroke, which I thought was a burr on one of the side cutters. I tried to clean the edge of the side cutters, but this was impossible with disassembling the pliers. This didn't look hard, until I found that the pivot screw/nut is locked in place. The ""grab"" annoyed me so much, though, that I forced the hardened screw and broke it off in the rear side of the pliers. It was not removable without destroying the crimpers, so I bought the Billfisher Heavy Duty Crimper HD-800.I've used this one for a while and I have reservations about it, too. It has no side cutters, so I have to carry another wire/cable cutter with me, and it is not spring loaded. It crimps OK, but is hard to use with one hand, unless your hands are very large, and the action is rough and choppy. If I had to choose between the two, I'd go back to the CN-10 model."
207539,2,"I bought this for survival when no drinkable water is available. I saw comments before that this is unbreakable. It is not true. Most parts are aluminium but the casing is really just flimsy plastic. If this could be converted to an aluminium sleeve, then this will be the best you ever get. I drop the filter by accident and the casing had a small chip. You think you can trust this thing for survival? I am now thinking of machining my own steel casing to replace this sleeve. So much for 200+ bucks."
95769,0,"My son has a bow, so I had to find some descent but inexpensive arrows. You get what you pay for with these. They work well for the first couple shoots, then the tips come off. We glued them back on and now they stay, but then a couple of the rubber feathers have come off."
347071,0,"I bought this for my husband for a trip to Hawaii. He does not swim very well and needs to feel comfortable in the water. As the description says, this is not a dry snorkel - I knew that ahead of time and was able to buy a better one. The fins look snazzy with the cutout design but the plastic is very pliable. These two features combined make the fins bend back a lot. For a beginner it makes it tough to stand up or stabilize your self if the ocean is not calm. Once you get going they are fine, but beginners take a bit of time standing and getting ready when they are beach snorkeling. The mask seal (the one that connects to your face) was of a cheaper hard plastic. This meant you had to pull it tighter than you should have to to get a seal. The tight fit means mask lines on your face. All in all - cheaper than renting at the beach but by the end of the trip we'd bought a new mask so.... you decide."
147855,1,"This knife is cool looking, sharp, and tough. The blade that came with my order was superior to the one advertised. Mine came with Aus 8-a in stead of 440a. (The aus8 a is better). With a little loosening up and a drop of oil, this knife flies open. The picture doesn't show quite how cool this knife is. It was bigger than I expected. Still, 5 stars."

472186,0,"Shipping was very fast and watch is decent quality for the money.This watch apes the looks of a Rolex Submariner quite well.Machining on the case is good with no sharp edges, dial rotates smoothly and lines up with markers and movement seems good (Citizen Miyota) but waiting for it to settle in. Bracelet is very sub-par despite having solid links. End links however are folded and clasp is not quite as refined as others (Seiko) and does have some sharp edges as well as lending a very hollow and rattely sound to the bracelet overall.All-in-all, not bad for the money."
231529,2,Received these as a gift for our 7 year old with only the best intentions. My 11 year old also tried them. If the picture on the box was anywhere near reality then it would be a great toy and would blame no one for buying them. Followed direction and put them together. They are quite a pain to put together because you are supplied with a bag of 50 greasy elastic bands that need to be fed through hooked onto the shoes. Setup is different depending on the weight of the child which is understandable but its a hassle.There is very little elastic stretch or 'bounce' with these. The picture on the box looks like you are bouncing off a trampoline and my guess is the kid in the picture actually is! The sad truth is you can probably jump higher and with more flexibility without the shoes than with on. They are also quite dangerous in my opinion. I made my daughter wear a helmet for the few minutes she tried them before giving up frustrated and I couldnt blame her. You can easily twist an ankle or worse with these.Would you really let your kid jump as high as the kid in the photo with the shoes strapped to their feet with two weak velcro straps?I really question the validity of the positive reviews on this one.
402169,2,"don't waste a penny on this one. leaks from the mouth spout, so you get wet on the front of yourself the whole hike."
60137,2,"This is suppose to be one of the best, however it fell apart three times my first one mile ride. The attachment for the seat to the bike is made of plastic with very small thumb turn screws to hold the seat to the frame. Three times the right seat fell off onto the road and the last time almost got hit by a car trying to retrieve the parts. Very poor design and may be some major liability there with this product.By the way, I tightened the thumb screws as tight as possible and within 10 minutes the right side (and parts) fell to the road.You should come up with something safer as I hurt myself when the seat fell off before I finally had to walk the bike home."
441318,1,"at first this barrel seemed like a waste of money because i just couldn't figure out why in the hell it wasn't staying on. but after a day or two of searching i out how to put it on so for anyone interested in this her you go.screw the barrel in and then put the metal ""cap"" on the end and but the sight into the little holes and see where the sight lines up if it isn't then take off the cap and sight and pull down on the circle thing at the bottom of the barrel and pull apart the barrel shroud. there is square piece with a hole in it loosen that with an allan key and move it so that when you put the barrel shroud back the ""cap"" and the sight it lines up. so you tight that up then put the shroud back on then you put the cap on then put the sight in the two little holes on the cap then get the allan key and underneath the sight by the metal sling part there is another hole to tight that up against the barrel.hope that helped now onto the product the barrel is pretty good i upped my velocity a little bit and it was pretty dead on so i like this barrel a lot and it gives you the look and feel of a m4.the reason this is only getting 4 stars is the fact there is no instructions in the packaging but it is really cheap these can be $70 plus in stores and dorosports ships fast"

388490,0,"I looked at some other safes online and at the local stores around my house. I bought mine at Lowe's Home Improvement and was happy with the purchase. I read a review for a different safe that mentioned the combination on their safe was off by 2 numbers in both directions so, I played with mine. I was able to go anywhere from 5-8 numbers off of the actual combination First Alert provided me and the safe would still open...I'm not too happy with this and it does concern me a little bit but I still think it's a good safe will protect my pistol and gun ammo just fine."

I modified mine with a section of milk carton held in place with a zip tie to block water from getting through the narrow pivot/mounting bracket section.If you want an effective, no hassle, (but ugly), way to block mud from getting through the weak point, just tie a plastic shopping bag around the pivot joint.A helpful thing about this fender is that it can be adjusted to work with a full suspesion bike. I dissasembled the pivot jount and flipped the mounting section to get a more extreme angle, so the fender would clear the back wheel whith the suspension bottomed out (7 inches of travel on that baby!)To get enough clearance I had to mount the fender on the seat post rather rhan the down tube. but it still works OK. A little bit of mud and water get past the fender, since it is so far from the tire, but is's better than it was with nothing there."

The only negative is some sight limitations while wearing it.
494130,1,"I've been a road runner for many years and have done quite a few marathons and a few trail ultras as well. In the last few years I've been starting to do more trail running. Recently I finally decided to look into buying trail running shoes--I've always just used my favorite road shoes, the Brooks Beast. Now I know what I've been missing! The Montrail Hardrocks are outstanding. The stiff sole means you're not feeling the sharp rocks and roots underneath. They've got really good protection for the toes too. For someone looking for a sturdy trail running shoe for hard trails, including trail marathons and ultras--this is the way to go."

It did keep them at bay but the noise was not very comfortable. We reduced the volume to silent for humans. The noise was gone but the squirrels returned. We have not seen the mice we expected and possibly a reduction of smaller bugs but it did not do what I had hoped it would do for the squirrels. They chewed through sofit, insulation and wood. I will keep trying it in the hopes that at some point the squirrels will get fed up with the sound. I just won't hold my breathe."
440324,0,"If you don't know better, these probably seem like an improvement over the cheapest karate scrubs available, but compared to quality middle-weights, these really do seem like cheap lightweights. I wanted to replace some quality middle-weights that use a drawstring with something equivalent with this type of waist band. In that regard, this type of waistband is much more comfortable than a drawstring alone. Another plus is that they have a back pocket. Their saving grace is that they only cost about $20.On the downside, as I alluded to, compared to real, quality middle-weights, these are thin, light and abrasive, being partially synthetic. They're more of a middle-ground between real middle weights and light weights. Additionally, unlike a lot of other quality pants, they lack any fastener for the pocket. So don't put anything in it if you're training (not that you should anyway).It's a ""for the money, they're decent"" thing."

138150,0,"I recently purchased this bicycle helmet (Bell Triton for ""those who are large of head"") and found the fit on my large head to be very comfortable. Upon trying to adjust the straps, however, I found the straps to be too short for a comfortable fit that doesn't feel like it is going to choke me out. I understand the difference between snug and so snug that it gives the feeling of being choked out. Why didn't Bell make the straps an inch or maybe two longer to match the size of the helmet? I'm very disappointed in Bell on this issue. I sent Bell an email asking for assistance with either an extension strap or the male and female buckle ends so that I could make an extension myself. NO RESPONSE! I then called their 1-800 number and asked about an extension buckle/strap and they told me that they did not carry such an item. They would supply me witha replacement male buckle but refused to sell me the female part so I could manufacture my own extension strap. (No doubt because of personal injury lawyers and liability... Thanks guys!)So, I'm left to fend for myself. I'll have to manufacture an extension strap. I want to be safe and wear a bicycle helmet and Bell manufactures a helmet that will fit my head. They don't, however, manufacture the helmet with straps long enough to match the size of the helmet. Let the buyer beware.11/19/06Addendum: I recently found my old regular sized Bell helmet from some years back (OK, from about 15 years back) and was able to wear it although it was quite snug. I found that the straps from the OLD regular sized helmet were LONGER than the straps on the new oversized helmet. This is obviously a design flaw and now I'm even more disappointed in Bell. Bell? Are you listening? You screwed up."

422920,0,This watch comes as shown (and arrived very quickly from Amazon). It works well and is easy to set. The only problem is the velcro band. It is not long enough to slip over my hand - I have to thread it though the slot to fasten (not easy to do one-handed).

233778,0,"I hike several days a week, year round, over rough mountain terrain. My good experiences with the Camelbak 1400 cu. in. military tactical H.A.W.G. led me to purchase a tactical Motherlode for use on long or cold weather day hikes, as well as for short overnight trips.The Motherlode is very well constructed, with excellent zippers and many useful pockets and compartments. I was quite disappointed, however, when I loaded it up and took it out on tough trails. Regardless of how the load was packed and the straps cinched up, the Motherlode tended to pull away from my body uncomfortably, especially when scrambling over rough terrain and rocks. I am 6'2"" tall and weigh 175 lbs. I'm not sure exactly what the problem was, it just was not possible to make the pack fit comfortably and balance well with any kind of load. The pack is relatively heavy by itself, but even when loaded lightly it feels quite a bit heavier than it is.Finally, I bought a Camelbak Trizip model which was reputed to include the renowned Mystery Ranch suspension system and design. The Trizip is everything in terms of comfort on hikes that the Motherlode is not. The Motherlode would be an adequate pack for organizing and storing gear if only short travel on foot is needed. But the Trizip is much better balanced, and much more comfortable on extended hikes, and well worth the added expense"

431942,1,"The main ingredient of this insect killer is Pyrethrin, a natural chemical distilled from the flower Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium. It is by far the safest insecticide currently known to man, and biodegrades quickly. I would not buy anything else for indoor usage.Pyrethrin also repels insects. The only drawback is that it is relatively weak and lasts a very short time (due to the rapid biodegradation). If the insect infestation is serious and the plants are outdoors, stronger insecticides with greater toxicity may do better, at least if you have a few days before harvesting.I use it against fungus gnats growing in the damp soil of my indoor seedling incubators. It kills on contact within seconds. Pyrethrin is so safe that I don't mind spraying it into the air after a flying gnat. Against larger pests like fruit flies, however, it is not always effective. For those, I keep a fly shooter in the house."

401384,0,"I'm new to the Muay Thai scene, but I purchased a set of Te: 180 Everlast wraps from the gym I go to and they are made of soft, semi-stretchy fabric that makes it incredibly easy to wrap, even for a beginner. Since I am going several times a week (and don't have time to wash after every workout) I wanted to get a few extra pairs to have around. I made the wrong assumption that these wraps, while knowing they would be shorter, would at least be made of the same quality. But I was terribly wrong :(. These wraps are coarse and have very little give when wrapping. They fit my small hands (I'm a female who typically wears small gloves and even those can be too big), so the 108"" size was just fine, but the wraps were uncomfortable, and definitely dug in between my fingers, even though I had tried to not wrap them too tight (which is hard to do, considering if you don't warp them snug enough, they slip off pretty easily -- like I said, there is not very much give). When I wore them to the gym, the instructor (who knows I'm new to this) recommended I don't wear these any more, as they will scuff up my hands. So...sadly I will have to set these aside and invest in better quality wraps again."

461873,0,"I'm in grad school so I have a lot of books I am moving in and out of the bag, but I don't have a lot in at once. I usually carry a 2-3 inch binder and some days a book or 2 which can be anywhere from 2-3 inches for each book. At first I thought this was a great bag. Then the bottom lining starting shedding. The black particles starting getting in all my books and binder. So now the bottom of the bag is just a thin mesh lining.In the pocket where you can keep your pencils and what not (they show it carrying scissors), one of the pockets already tore. Mind you, I'm not rough with my stuff, especially for a pocket like that to tear. I really have no idea how it could have torn.The plaster handle on top of the bag works...as long as you don't use it when carrying your bag. It seems like if you use it to carry the bag (if only for a few seconds), it will start falling apart.Overall, it still carries the stuff I need, to and from my house...but now I have to look for another bag that can hold up and not get black stuff all of my books.I'd recommend trying to find another bag."

87182,0,"I did a lot of research when I looked into buying a pair of wayfarers. The reviews and price on the sunglass express vender made them seem legit enough. So I ordered a set of 54s, polarized. When I received the pair I was happy with how they appeared, they passed every test of authenticity i could find online. They had the metal rod in the frame, the RB on the left lense, etc, all of it. It came with all the right materials too.But here's the kicker. The box DID NOT HAVE THE SERIAL NUMBER OR ANY SIGN OF THE AUTHENTICITY STICKER THE BOX IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE.It also wasn't packaged well.I heard the fakes are getting better and better so I actually called and emailed sunglass express to ask why it lacked said sticker or any serial number.This is what they sent me, pretty much identical to what their 'at a glance' page says:Hello,Thank you for your inquiry and we are available to speak with you at 516.352.4568 Monday thru Friday 11am until 5pm est. All the frames from our site are 100% authentic. We purchase them directly from Luxottica, the manufacturer of RayBan sunglasses and eyeglasses. Please note that Luxottica is now manufacturing some of their frames in China. A lot of companies outsource for labor to keep the price down and to help with the demand of the frame. Luxottica said the sunglasses and eyeglasses you received are made with the same machinery, same materials and the same quality of labor.Regards,Sunglass ExpressNotice that they say all of our FRAMES are authentic.The woman on the phone was not friendly and told me that they warranty the sunglasses but ray ban does not. This should not be the case.SO, they're either REALLY good fakes, or they PURCHASE THE FRAMES ONLY, and the rest, including the box, is knock off. Hence, the lower price and ability to claim authenticity.In any case, I like the shades and they seem pretty real. But, lacking a factory serial number and the poor attitude of the customer service woman leaves them with two stars.***UPDATE***I went to sunglass hut and compared everything from the box to the shades themselves to the real thing. They are real. The boxes no longer have european recycling logos on them, and that was my main worry. Compared to the pair sunglass hut had, these were identical.Points are still lost for 3 reasons, however:1: Badly packaged. The box was dented upon arrival and more care could have been done.2: Bad attitude in customer service. The lady I called was rude, plain and simple. Not cool.3: Still no official Rayban serial number, only a sunglass express stock number.I'm glad i made friends with the sunglass hut guy at my local mall. he said he'd do any warranty work I wanted to my pair."

477587,0,"Nice machine. Good feel. Heavy. Solid. Falls a little flat. Not quite enough follow through in design and programming.The users manual is almost useless. It doesn't explain how to use the pre-set workout programs, or HOW to perform the machine's routine maintenance. For example it says ""lubricate belt"" but doesn't say HOW to do that. And it says ""be sure the belt is at the right tension."" How the heck would I know if it is at the right tension? How critical is the tension? Worst of all, the manual seems to be a general guide regardless of which machine you have, so you are never sure (or you have to read Really carefully) whether the particular feature it references even APPLIES to the Series 3.A nice feature is that the installation hardware arrived neatly packaged in plastic shrunk to a piece of cardboard that made it easy to identify everything and ensure you have everything you need before starting. Unfortunately I was supposed to have 22 of a particular type of screw, but I only had 20 of it. There was another screw type that I only needed four of, but the kit had 6. Fortunately the two extra fit where the two missing needed to go, so I just made sure where I used the ""extras"" installed where I don't see them. (Since they are shiny silver, compared to the flat black of the missing ones.) Incidentally there was a small ""7"" sticker on the back of the piece of cardboard the hardware kit came on, which made me wonder if perhaps they gave me a series 7 hardware kit?Unfortunately during my ten mile walk yesterday I got static electric zaps 50 or 60 times. Maybe if I wore the safety clip I wouldn't build up a charge, but I won't wear the safety clip because when I accidentally pulled the safety key out (twice!) yesterday the machine wouldn't restart my program from where it had left off... I had to power down, power up, and re-enter my weight, desired program, etc.The static electric zaps are NOT because my receptacle isn't grounded; it is definitely grounded.The heart rate monitor is unreliable enough to be dismissed as worthless. Heart rate can be an excellent workout guide, but if I were serious about using it I'd get a stand alone system that I could link up to my computer, so this worthless feature doesn't bother me too much.The area where you should be able to place your books or magazines is NOT shaped right for placing your reading materials there. Whatta fail! How hard would it have been for them to make a nice ledge? Instead the ledge has no lip and everything is curved plastic. You can sort of balance your magazine there, but I keep thinking it's going to fall underfoot and I'll sprain my ankle. I happen to watch TV while walking/jogging, so the reading materials issue doesn't affect me too much, but it sucks to know the designers were so worried about making the dashboard accommodate the FAN that is present there in the series 5 and 7 that they threw the series 3 customers to the dogs.I'm not the most intense runner in the world, but I do like to walk or jog 10-15 miles at a time at about 5mph. Since I am so slow I end up having to break up my workout into a couple sessions because the machine won't let me simply enter my desired DISTANCE. I have to enter how much TIME I want to work out. And it maxes out at 90 minutes. (Or maybe it lets you enter 99 minutes, but I go with a couple of 90 minute workouts for easier math.) It would be nice if I didn't have to break up my routine and keep track of my stats and add them together later. That seems silly for what could be such a nice machine.It would be nice if the workout keys were labled, but they aren't. You have to either simply remember which programs are which, label the buttons yourself, or turn the machine on and off while you select each program to see what it is, then turn it off and on again if that wasn't the program you wanted, and try the next program.Also, I don't mean to complain, but I really miss having a decent ""intervals"" setting. I was expecting there to be a good ""intervals"" setting because every ""nice"" machine I've ever used has had a great one.I'm talking about the kind of program that lets you rest a minute then kicks up the speed and incline for a minute or two then lets you rest, then kicks it up higher, then lets you rest, then kicks it up til you think you're going to die, etc. THAT is a great workout. This machine doesn't really have anything like that.Here is a description of the programs and the led icons for each program:1. CARDIO (oval track)-you basically adjust the speed and incline manually throughout your workout2. CARDIO (2 litle hills)3. RUNNING (6 little hills)4. FAT BURN (6 little hills)5. SPEED INTERVAL (8 little hills)6. HILL INTERVAL (2 big hills)Bascially Running, fat burn, and speed interval look like pretty much the same program, just with slightly different speeds and inclines. The cardio and hill interval programs also look pretty similar to each other, except the hill interval raises the incline a lot more.Bottom line: this is a good, basic, solid machine. It could have been a great machine but Bowflex was more interested in the bells and whistles they gave their series 5 and series 7 customers.That won't stop me from getting the most out of my new treadmill, but it will stop me from buying from this company again."

448926,0,"This bike is very fun and attractive. However, it requires some expertise to put it together. It is packed with the front fork backwards to take up less space, so you need to turn it around before putting on the fender and wheel. There is nothing in the instruction booklet to explain this to you. Also, ours came with a very wobbly front wheel. I did some research on the internet and figured out how to true the wheel by tightening the spokes, and now the front wheel is straight and no longer wobbles. If you don't have much mechanical aptitude you might need some help putting it together, but other than that, it's a great bike!"

The preview section only covered four of the dozens of moves in this workout, and it didn't cover them in the context of the other moves surrounding them. Way too hard to learn. Yeah, once I learn the moves I will enjoy not having the steps delineated slowly every time, but still, this workout will lose most of the people who try it."

130032,2,"Liked Mag Lite, got tired of replacing batteries, and its a bit over large. Streamlight sounded good, more efficient design with LEDs and traditional Xenon combination and with aircraft alum construction.Realiy is that the construction is indeed great, equal of Mag. Problem is that the LED light is really strange flourescent-like blue that doesn't project much light at all. What it does project is off color and tends to distort colors of other things. Find myself going for more light from the xenon quite often (and in process loosing the LED efficiency benefit), but the way this designed, with 10 holes to accomodate the LEDs the reflector weakens the xenon into a short, limited beam. ""A"" for construction quality, but other than that this product doesn't satisfy if you are seeking real brightness."

I have a feeling the success of this brand (their entire line of products) is a triumph of marketing and myth making over reality. The main reason for me to write a review is to warn you, if you've never used this before and are ordering it for the first time, you might find that after it arrives and you're stuck with it you don't much like the way it smells. That's what happened to me (my husband didn't like the smell of it, either). We persevered and used it until it was gone, but we won't be buying it again."

110231,0,"I got this as a gift for my partner and she likes it. I test drove it and it works pretty well. It was fairly easy to put together although I needed to take it to a bike shop to get the brakes adjusted correctly. My only criticism is that the gear shifter is a bit weird and clunky and it's easy to get caught between gears as you're riding causing the bike to make a slight grinding sound. This is because it uses a twist adjuster so it's hard to gauge what gears you are on without looking down to see the number display. Of course as you are cruising through traffic this is not recommended! I may be old-fashioned or just haven't gotten used to it yet, but I prefer the traditional up-down push gears - you can tell where you are by feel. But it rides smoothly otherwise."

I've only had it for 2 weeks and you can tell its already working. The ironman ab wheel is nice, sturdy and simple. I gave it a 4 stars because the grips are a little hard so it can hurt your hand after long periods of use. Also it doesn't come with extensive instructions on use or anything so what I did was hit up youtube and watched how it should be used because with ill use it can hurt your back badly. All in all though I would recommend this to someone else. This, cardio and eating right will give you a nice stomach as your reward."

My wife notices the distortion also and she prefers the 7 X 50's. I suggest trying before buying if possible. Another pair may not have the distortion or it may not bother you.Other than that, the filed of vision makes them very good for birding or other action-packed viewing.You should check the main page above to make sure you get the right size for your needs.

438888,0,"I bought this stove because it came highly recommended. When the stove arrived, I tested it out prior to going camping. It is very easy to set up. Good quality material. The biggest disappointment was the valve that controls the heat. It functions more like an On/Off switch. I exchanged the original one thinking I received a defect. The second one acted the same way. At that point, I didn't have time to get a new stove for my camping trip. I used the stove to cook just about every meal while camping. The problem with this stove is that the heat is always on high. When cooking I had to constantly stir the food to keep it from burning.Overall, I think the stove is very easy to assemble and made of high quality material. It feels very solid. But the heat adjustment control is very disappointing."

Therefore, this piece of equipment has been sitting idle in my house for a little less than a month. I received this product on June 12, 2006 in a box that was in very poor condition. I wondered how it was able to contain its heavy content. The box was ripped (big holes) and held together by bands and clear tape. I'm pretty sure the condition of the box was the cause of the missing part. I ordered the part a few days later through the manufacturer. As of right now (07/05/2006), I am still without that part and have an unassembled Power Tower collecting dust in my house. Based on other reviews, I am pretty sure it is a great product.

348461,0,"I noted that the actual description is a ""Rio Adventure Camp Cot (King-Size)"". It is an ""adventure"" sleeping on it... as for it being ""king-size"" they must be referring to the ""gnome-king"" in the ""Wizard of ID"". This is only 22 inches wide and 74 inches long. I am 5'10"", so the length is okay. But my shoulders are considerably wider than 22"" and I have to sleep on my right or left side. I can sleep on my back, but I have to fold my arms across my chest to be reasonably comfortable. I have used them two times on camping trips. But there is a problem with this type camp cot. First, it should be 24-26 inches wide and there should be a safety strap that should connect each of the ""end"" supports with the end of the sleeping frame to keep this cot stable when you get up in the middle of the night. You can make do with the size (but this should be improved by the manufacturer to widen it), but you do not need an unstable support. A strap at both ends that snap to the cot would prevent it from collapsing when you least expect it. This has happened twice. Also, they could make the supports longer so that it is 18"" off the ground rather 12""... it is tough to get up from this cot. This particular model might be good for 12-14 year old child. It is hardly the type cot that I would purchase for an adult. It also has weight limitation of 220 lbs. I am 200 lbs, so it works. The fabric that is used on the cot is okay. Not great, just okay. This cot was manufactured in China... and manufactured cheaply."

461914,0,"As I'm typing out this review, I have my backpack in front of me. I got it in November of last year, so it's less than a year old. I'm a high school student, so I do lug around a lot of stuff around in it. It has not withstood said treatment as well as I had hoped, after reading the glowing reviews on Amazon. There are several tears in the canvas. Everything else seems to have held up okay, so far. The zippers are fine. The padding on the straps is very comfortable and comes in handy a lot. Overall, though, if you are looking for long-term quality, I would not suggest purchasing this backpack. I think its lifespan is a couple years, at most. I would suggest L.L. Bean backpacks. My sister (also high-school age) owns one of those, and after three years, it's in better shape than mine."

440662,0,"If you don't know better, these probably seem like an improvement over the cheapest karate scrubs available, but compared to quality middle-weights, these really do seem like cheap lightweights. I wanted to replace some quality middle-weights that use a drawstring with something equivalent with this type of waist band. In that regard, this type of waistband is much more comfortable than a drawstring alone. Another plus is that they have a back pocket. Their saving grace is that they only cost about $20.On the downside, as I alluded to, compared to real, quality middle-weights, these are thin, light and abrasive, being partially synthetic. They're more of a middle-ground between real middle weights and light weights. Additionally, unlike a lot of other quality pants, they lack any fastener for the pocket. So don't put anything in it if you're training (not that you should anyway).It's a ""for the money, they're decent"" thing."

62252,2,"My kids love these bottles. My now 12 year old and 7 year old used their own money to buy their camelbak bottles about a year and a half ago. They worked great for quite awhile. Then after about 10 mos. of use, the lid on one broke. The part that flips open and shut broke where it swivels. I wrote the company and they honored the warranty, sending me a new lid, no problem. At the same time, I bought a third bottle because occassionally my oldest would take his little brother's. The two that originally bought theirs use theirs at school every day. Well, again, we had good lids for about 5 months. Then, another snapped at the same place as the first. It was still usable but it would leak if it wasn't upright. I figured this lid must be the other ""old"" one. Then, a month later another broke at the same place but on both sides so that it is completely unusable. That means one of the newer ones (6 mos old) is now broken. I have no way to know which lid is which. I have no idea if the company will honor another warranty request since I cannot prove which bottle is which. And, yet, it's looking like these lids will not last longer than 6-12 mos. I think it's because the joint is plastic and it cannot take the stress of the rubber bite valve being pulled off every day in order to clean it. And, that's another thing, when the last one broke completely, we could see inside where it cannot be cleaned (we do own the cleaning kit and use it to be as thorough as possible). It is disgusting in there. I'm unconvinced that it is even safe for my kids to use these lids. Basically, there is a rubber straw piece that sits inside the plastic part that the bite valve goes on. That plastic part is what swivels open and closed and what is breaking. It is also a part that doesn't come off. Meanwhile, it looks like water leaks out of the inner rubber straw and gets caught in that plastic which you can't get in to clean. It wasn't moldy but it was crusty and clearly not clean. Additionally, I cannot find anywhere to buy just the lids so if the warranty isn't in order, you have to buy a whole new bottle just to get a lid. There has got to be a better alternative out there. I don't know where but there has to be. I know I don't want to be buying new $10-$15 bottles every 6 mos just to get a lid. And, I don't want to be filing a warrany every 6 mos. either."

1145,1,"You certainly wouldn't want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. I purchased it from a gold box offer shortly before Memorial Day, and just got back from a camping trip. Everyone was jealous of this HUGE tent. I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get."

However, if you're doing heated yoga and sweat a lot like I do, the ribbing isn't enough to keep you from sliding. I've gone back to my original Manduka mat plus a Yogitoes skidless towel for the hot yoga, but use this one if I go to a non-heated class."
490768,1,"Last year I bought the whole package, the bull worker with the steel bow and the straps; I also bought last year's isobow to stretch. When I recieved the box, I was a bit skeptical but stayed with the workout using the bullworker; then I switch to the steel bow because I was lazy... I got the sit at home dvd with the package and started doing the whole 90 routine. Man am I happy that I did that...I started at 185, size 38; I'm 5'6 so you can imagine my roundness. 3 months passed and I got a new motivation... a girl that I wanted to make happy, so I stayed with a heavier routine; stayed with the recommended diet and used only the steel bow for half of the year. And although I did reached 145lb last year, I'm now in a 150lb size 32 still using my bow and happy with my now fiance.God put this little gadget on my way, along a good diet; and it was the best thing that ever happened. After a year, I have more lean muscle, more strenght and even my abs are showing (which I couldn't even see before). This is fast and works... I mean.. a YEAR and I have abs, more strenght and a great feeling when people come up to you and say ""You look great, what did you do?""."
106754,1,Purchased for my daughter...very good knife for her. She loves the scissors. Would like to see the philips blade in-lieu of the corkscrew. The &#34;package carrying hook&#34; is laughable. The can openers on swiss army knives are one of the few that actually work. The textured red handle panels help keep the knife from inadvertently from slipping out of a pant pocket.
349883,0,"Boy, I've had a love-hate relationship with my Gerber Legend 800! When I got the Gerber it was by far the best multitool I had ever used. It blew away my 80s vintage SOGs, Leathermen, swiss army knives and such. I'had the Gerber from 2002 to 2005 and used it intensively most of that time. If I hadn't lost it I would be using it still. The two tools I've used since (Leatherman Charge Ti and Victorinox SwissTool Spirit) are far better designed and show the Gerbers problems. Even so - there are still things about it that nothing else matches and I sometimes find myself wishing I had the big Gerber in those situations that favor it:Hots:Best pliers for detail work in the multi-tool world. As far as I know this is the only springloaded pliers on a multitool anywhere. They are beefy - no sideways wiggle here - and because they open themselves you use them with your whole hand (no back gripping on the inside with the pinky finger to open them like you have to do with every other pliers). This unique aspect makes them much more comfortable and useable for a multitude of tasks. I respect the spotlight review that complained about these not opening up enough for common plumbing - maybe so - but for detail work they have no equal. The wirecutter blade inserts are great too and make you wonder why everyone doesn't do this. Not only are the replaceable wirecutter blades good for inspiring confidence that if you ruin the edge with some hard wire you have recourse - the carbide blades actually do a really job of cutting hard wire - better than any other multitool.Also - all the tools lock securely - no pinching - and the tools don't open up accidentally by themselves either. The lock mechanism is smooth and easy to employ.Finally - I really like the one hand opening knife and scissors. As far as I know this is the only one hand opening scissors in the business - and since the scissors is such a commonly used tool this is a great and commonly used feature. One hand opening blade is so essential that once you've had it it's hard to go back.What's less than hot:The scissors spring is stiff to operate and there's no thumbpad. Your thumb just bears down on the edge of the scissors - and it hurts in extended use. The spring mechanism is a bent wire - a bit crude. The scissors are nice and sharp - but considering that Gerbers is Fiskars I was expecting better.The knife is a nice clip point but it's half straight and half serrated. The principle competition (Leatherman's Charge) has both a smooth clip point and a separate serrated - so this feels like a halfway effort. In use, however, it's fine.The ""Remgrit"" saw is useless except for tile. Forget using it on wood - it has grit - not teeth. The saving grace is that the saw is designed to take jigsaw blades - which at first glance seems brilliant. In practice it turns out that there isn't really a true standard for jigsaw blade socket designs and many don't fit here. The other issue is that jigsaws are power tools and this is a hand saw. I never did find a jigsaw blade that was even close in functionality to the saws on Victorinox or Leatherman's offerings. I actually ended up drilling holes in bosch jigsaw blades to make them fit the Gerber, because I felt they came closest - but were much more fragile.The phillips head screwdriver is the adapter for the bit kit. It's a pretty stubby driver and doesn't fit into too many recessed places. The bit kit takes standard bits - a big plus. However the bit holder doesn't mate securely with the phillips head and tends to slip - or drop bits - in use. Also the bit kig comes with a case that's too small to hold the Legend (it's meant for a smaller model). Since no one makes a case that holds both the legend and the bit kit - the kit often gets left behind. BTW - the bit kit rusts up pretty badly too.The file is OK - but isn't as sharp as the one on the Leatherman or Victorinox. The Leatherman Charge's file has a soft diamond side for nails as well - a nice touch.The tools are poorly laid out. The thumb catches on the little flathead, phillips head, and file are all completely impossible to use because they are hidden behind other tools. This is just sloppy engineering. The tools open beautifully by themselves - something that older multitools had real problems with - but you end up having to open adjacent tools anyway - just be able to reach the ones you need.The grippy side panels are rubber adhesive stickers that come off. This didn't bother me much - but it was a silly decision.The locking mechanism digs into your palms in certain grips.The handles are made of aluminum which is supposed to make them light. However, to make them strong Gerber had to make the handles big and thick. This makes the tool very large in the hand. For big handed guys like me this is great - but there are no weight savings here. I have to question the engineering choice of using Aluminum handles since I have come to appreciate the slim elegance of Victorinox's Swisstool Spirit (that uses sleek mirror finished stainless handles) and the Leatherman Charge Ti (which uses sleek and rugged titanium handles).Finally - and fatally for me - the case is nylon with velcro which doesn't last and has some stitching durability issues. That's how I ended up losing mine. one day it just came off my belt - the beltloop stiching gave way. I didn't notice it until I got home, sadly.I know I just gave a long list of gripes but when I add it up in my head in the end I have to say that Gerber is one of the best multitools out there. It's rough and tough and covers almost all the bases and while it has a few rough edges it also has a few standout points. However, given the cost and knowing what I know now I'd probably buy either the Victorinox Spirit or Leatherman Charge Ti (or Wave) first - but not by a wide margin. If you use a pliers for detail work with regularity - this might be the one for you warts and all."

457092,2,"I am amazed at the negative votes on the reviews that say this game freezes! I, along with numerous other gamers across both the Xbox and PS2 platforms, are experiencing significant locking up with the game in Franchise mode. There are currently threads on the ESPN videogames official message board site about the problem. The main thread has over 12 TWELVE pages of individuals writing in with their own specific lock-up problems!!! This cannot be ignored!I made the switch over from EA Sports to ESPN NHL Hockey (2k4) last year. This year, with the $19.99 price, there was no question! I was staying with 2k5. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!Please heed this warning and review this situation for yourself before making the decision to purchase this game. ESPN won me over in 2k4, but I'm going back to EA Sports after this. I'd rather pay $50 for a game that I can play than $20 for one that freezes. I haven't played my 2k5 for months now."

335170,0,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband and didn't open the package fully until probably two months after it arrived. Shame on me. The towel was thinner than expected but another reviewer said the same so my expectations were low. The print is only on one side, the other side is white, with the colors and patterns from the other side showing thru because the material is so thin. It's not a terribly big towel, more of a wrap around your waist size towel than a towel big enough to cover a lounge chair. Check the measurements to ensure you know what size towel you are buying. Again, shame on me, I didn't check. Lastly, when I opened the package for the first time I found a rip on the towel about one inch long, towards the bottom. Almost like a burn? Hard to describe, perhaps caused by machinery, I'm certain the towel wasn't used. Anyways, the towel was a hit with my husband and he still hasn't noticed the rip but he hasn't used the towel much. My young daughters love the towel, it's just the right size for them but they love the Gators so they love anything with the logo on it! So buyer beware, and open that package right away!"

395380,1,"Dear Amazon Reader,I just got back from Florida and have returned to Indiana and thought I would comment about this rod because this is one of the two rods I used in Florida. Just so we are clear I used the 15 footer. I thought this rod was more of a freshwater surf rod due to its line weight of 10-30 lbs but I releived it is just a light salt water surf rod. When I say light I am refering to the power of the right because the rod itself was actually kind of heavy. Well it was heavier than I thought. The reason I bought this rod is for the casting weights. This is the only rod that I could find that at 10 lb test could cast 2 oz. Although I have not tested this rod in freshwater I did use it in Florida and caught three striped bass. But my main reason to go to Florida was because the weather is hot and so are those fine chicks, cause I'm only 15."

196838,1,"After months of use I have found these muffs to be great, I have used them on the firing line with others next to me. The level of protection is superb no matter what caliber, all I hear is the report. I found that the noise reduction is better than almost any other type of protection I have used. No ""ringing"" in my ear after all range conditions even after 50 rounds through my large caliber pistols. In outdoor windy conditions I may have to turn the muffs backwards to reduce the noise, but I can still hear even with the wind noise.I bought a second pair for my wife and she is warming up to the idea of my .357 because the report is not spooking her (she never even held a gun before last month). She is well pleased with the ability to run through 100 round of small / med caliber ammo per session with no hearing loss or after effects.I have found that it requires care while installing the batteries to prevent damage to the contacts. I have used a friend's $400 muffs and his batteries are easier to install but the noise reduction is equal to me. But it is not worth $340 difference for me to not be careful :-)These muffs are electronic devices so I teat them accordingly."

118095,0,"I bought these for the purpose of being able to slip my regular tennis shoes on and off without hassle. For that they did okay, but not great. They do seem to have decreased the amount of damage I normally do to my shoe's plastic heel from slipping them on and off with regular laces - normally the plastic breaks, begins to flop around, then the back of the shoe is difficult to get on. So I consider it a good buy, IF it had lasted!Overall, these are a good idea, but in practice they are not quite worth it for two reasons:1) To really get a nice, snug fit, you have to pull these and stretch them way out. That pretty much defeats the purpose of having stretchy laces if they are stretched until they are not stretchy. You can achieve the same effect by loosening your regular shoe laces.2) I had these for about a year, then one day I go to slip them on and the lace just snaps suddenly. I wans't even really pulling hard on them. The sudden inconvenience is what got me to come back and write this review.If you're looking for a shoe laces upgrade... maybe try it if you don't care about the money, but don't expect much."
454990,0,"I have been a heart rate monitor user for over ten years now. Straight out of the box the Omron gave me wildly inconsistent readings. Due to the way water was beading on the chest band I was suspicious that a mold release agent might have been applied to it during the manufacturing process. (Where I work we use a silicone based mold release agent). Something seemed to be blocking a good connection from forming between my skin and the chest monitor. I cleaned the groves on the chest monitor with liquid dish washing detergent, a toothbrush and hot water and the issue went away. I have no evidence that this was the real problem or that washing was an effective solution but I don't have the problem anymore.The positives.-Inexpensive and appears to be well made.-Accurate.-Back-light.-Five well thought out buttons make it easy to use. I intensely dislike monitors that try to get one or two buttons to do everything.The negatives.-The wrist strap is about as stiff as two popsicle sticks. I wrapped it into a tight curl and held it over a blow dryer to help create a curve in the strap to make it more comfortable to wear. Much better now.-No In-zone countdown timer. I know they did not advertise it as having one but it's so easy to include that I don't understand why they omitted it. I miss not having that feature. It was on my Acumen.-Zone alarms are too soft to hear in a noisy environment. This may be a deal breaker for me. I depend on the alarms to guide my pace and I don't like straining to hear it. Constantly looking at the monitor bugs me. I would rather relax and let my mind wander until my workout is done.-Poor shielding from other electrical equipment. (See comment at bottom of page)Summary: If all you want is a heart rate monitor that is reasonably well made and fairly cheap then this is worth a try. Recommended.Comments: I have never used it in a gym so I can't comment on potential interference issues with exercise equipment and other HR monitors but it DOES NOT WORK IN EITHER ONE OF MY CARS. When I start the engine the heart rate goes to zero and the heart symbol beats erratically until I turn the engine off. My Acumen did not do that."

While the product was the same, the handling of the item left a lot to be desired. I actually had to return the initial shipment due to damage. The second one also had minor damage, but it was in an inconspicuous spot.The item is boxed in a printed, thin cardboard box with 1/2"" styrofoam corner protectors. The damage to both items was to the corners, so the packaging is pretty obviously inadequate. To compound the problem, Amazon doesn't place the item in a sturdier box to protect it during shipment. It was simply inserted in an opaque plastic bag and the bag was sealed.This was not my best experience with Amazon and makes me hesitant about purchasing larger, bulky items in the future."

Good bladder holds air a remarkably long time and flies a good distance. Color scheme and graphics are cool.Neutrals/Negatives: For match play, I like a ball I can feel on short passes, but this PU feels stiff. Slick texture is one one of the harder PUs to throw-in on a wet day.Overall, if you want a better quality, more match-oriented ball, the ""Pro-Max"" is the one to get.

484079,0,"I borrowed a pair of Yukon Charlies recently for a few days camping in the mountains in northern Washington. This isn't the exact model, but the binding here looks to be an identical system. Because the top bindings are plastic clasps on webbing (nylon?) they are pretty well crippled by ice accumulation. Even just a little ice creates a lot of slipping, which meant that while these shoes were fine for the first day, the bindings came fully open after only a couple steps on subsequent days. This was incredibly frustrating.To be fair, these conditions were far more extreme than people looking for an inexpensive pair of snowshoes will likely encounter (2+ feet of snow on our first night, blizzard conditions the second day). I think that they would do ok for a day hike that didn't get very intense.Also, these don't appear to come with poles, but I managed to bend one of the Yukon Charlies poles about 45 degrees when I slipped on a steep slope (I did not fall on to the pole, but rather fell away from it while it was planted in the snow.). I tried gently to unbend it and it immediately snapped off. Again, not surprising to find that inexpensive gear is made of less durable material, but worth mentioning."

79620,1,"These are similar in function to flippers for your feet, they increase thrust for each stroke, you will generally swim faster. If you use them for a breast stroke with underwater recover (the arms are not raised above the waters surface when returning them forward for the next stroke) they INCREASE drag and may negate any additional thrust you obtain from the pulling stroke. You will push ahead very fast, pull the arms and hands forward slower (with the fins edgewise to the flow of water to decrease drag) and then take another stroke, you slow down a lot with the underwater recover stroke. This can be beneficial as it also increases the effort in both directions and can burn more calories.If you use them in a crawl stroke (commonly and mistakenly referred to as ""free style"") with the arms rolled up and out of the water for the recovery stroke then the drag is reduced and you will swim much faster.If you want to burn more calories then use a breast stroke, want more speed then use the crawl stroke. Remember though if you want to burn more TOTAL calories then swim a certain TIME, say an hour, rather than swim a certain DISTANCE. The faster speed will negate any calorie burn benefits if you just go for distance rather than a certain time frame.These are good quality hard plastic. The rubber tubes grip the hands well and they work as advertised. If you have large hands the tubes will leave marks on your skin that last for a while."

251878,1,"I have never owned a Kayak before so I don't really have anything to reference this too. But since I only bought this for $80 I wasn't expecting anything great. My main objective was to use this for boating on a lake on an upcoming camping trip with me and my husband (I swim, he doesn't).Upon first opening, it was folded neatly in a box and was easy to remove it and unfold it. Don't forget how it's folded so you can fold it back the same way!I was already somewhat familiar with Coleman's inflating system (I have their airbeds also) and I wasn't that thrilled with it. It's got a dual locking system where the whole valve pushes into itself and then the typical float type closure.There are 8 air ports to blow up. 4 ports for the footwell areas. One air port for each seat and two air ports for the main kayak. It's a good design if one of the large main ports should rip while you're kayaking. The other large port would probably keep you afloat.So I took out my Ozark trail inflater/deflator pump and started inflating. Perhaps since my pump is an inflater/deflator, air kept backflowing out of the other pump port. I was getting frustrated because I couldn't get enough air into it.On top of that, the valve locking system on these Colemans is somewhat tricky and I was about to return it. By the time you'd get the air pump out of the valve, a huge amount of air was lost.So I finally figured out a great way to get it inflated easily and I would recommend using this method if you have a problem with the valve locking system. For the footwells and seats, I just manually blew air into them with my good ol' lungs. Believe me, I'm a small woman and it doesn't take much to blow them up. You'll be able to get a lot more air into them using your mouth. Now here's the trick. When it's full, take your tongue and put it into the valve so you get no air backflow. Then just push (with your tongue or head motion) the valve into itself. Then you can close the other air lock.Since the main air sections (2) are large. I used the pump to get it mostly filled and then blew a little more with my lungs to get it nice and full.The oars were fairly well made however the instructions to put together the oars were terrible. It just showed a picture. The oars consist of 3 metal tubes and 2 connectors. The metals tubes are supposed to go a certain way and it's up to you to figure this out. No help from the sparse manual here.The oar holders on the kayak are a joke though. They're a soft rubber C and the oars fell right out when we picked up the kayak to put it into the water.I was pleasantly surprised at how it worked though. It was easy to get into and it's comfortable (even wearing life vests). There are two storage areas covered by a net. The storage areas are good to put stuff into but don't expect to reach into it while you're on the kayak. It's not gonna happen. You'd probably fall into the water trying to reach them. The cup holders work well and are in a convenient spot.The kayak is easy to steer and moves fairly decently (for an inflatable) in the water. There's two fins (skegs?) on the bottom. One was slightly twisted (from being in the box) but it didn't seem to affect the performance at all.I overall like this kayak alot. It's great for recreation and good for people who are afraid of the water because it's very stable.It's a good deal for the money!"

I recently (Jan. 2013) ordered another of these screens for my younger sons team cause the screen was great, however was disappointed when it came because it no longer has wheels. Called Easton and they confirmed that yes it no longer comes with wheels. So, it is not very mobile anymore-- you have two options, either carry it (it is too heavy for one person to carry a distance) or buy a wheel kit for around $60-$80. I still love the screen, but am not happy with having to buy a wheel kit. You would think Easton could figure out how to fix this problem."
62663,1,"This is a very good gun for any airsofter. If you adjust the site properly, you will be blowing people away with accuracy!!

USE .20g BBs WITH THIS GUN. THEY ARE SOO MUCH MORE ACCURATE THAN .12s!! The flashlight is good because it uses an LED bulb. The foregrip helps steady the gun when aiming so it is a great add-on.

66354,2,"Don't buy this!! This watch is good to read the time and date, or as a stopwatch, but forget heart rate. I bought a Mio in Feb and it failed to work properly. Sent it back for a replacement and there is no improvement. They told me since I bought from Amazon I could not get a refund, but they would replace it again. However they did not reply when I asked if the next replacement could be expected to work, and that the problem I was reporting was not a common unresolved issue. Obviously they did not have test data to show that these watches perform as specified. I usually cannot get a Heart rate reading when exercising, only if not moving and not sweating. I'd say it works 5% of the time. Readings, when I can get one, are accurate sometimes, but often when running the watch will annoyingly beep repeatedly and give erroneous readings. What a waste."
465333,0,"Is a good product works well with minimal modification, needs a piece of an inch and a half PVC into holder first painted black and then umbrella fits perfect into holder with out over clamping umbrella so over all works very well. P.S.The umbrella handle now fits tight without being clamped.(Bag Boy handle)."
264296,2,If you are looking for the real Reebok replica jersey distributed by the NFL this is NOT it! This is a fake jersey with cheap embroidery whereas the originals are screen printed. It is the wrong color blue and is made of cheap material. Don't waste your money!
97254,2,This item was purchased for my seven year-old grandson with the purpose of encouraging him to hang up his clothes daily. Unfortunately the clothes rack fell over almost immediately after assembly and was broken rendering it unusable. I don't know what the problem was but suspect that the top team emblem is too heavy for the slender rack to support. A cute idea that did not work!MargaretFan of the San Diego Padres
158800,1,Excellent choice of colors! Loved that they came in a choice of either left or right hand. Good golf glove.

120049,2,"I was intrigued by Luminox watches for some time before getting one from my wife for Christmas. I excitedly strapped it on and went about my holiday, awaiting family and friends.It wasn't too long before I noticed that the watch was running slow, and after a few days stopped all together. Contacting Luminox ""Support"" the first time provided no reply what-so-ever. Second attempt four days later I received a somewhat vague ""Our Service Center can help you with this at 401-946-0920 or info@saltzmans-watches.com.""To say I'm disappointed in Luminox, both their product and support, is an understatement."
38426,0,Great strings as far as sound goes but the coating starts wearing of after a couple of weeks of use.
354242,1,I received the shoes earlier than expect. They are better than expect except that they were a little small. I get a 10 1/2 shoe size that they said was a 44. I am going to get my next pair and go for a 45. They are light have good traction on artificial turf. I played soccer in them and they are minimalist shoes. There is little cushion and that is what I wanted.I like the shoes and I will get some more in the coming weeks. They are inexpensive.

45844,2,"These wheels and brackets are sturdy and all, but the instructions call for six washers and two axle nuts THAT ARE NOT PROVIDED.

174943,0,the freight charge for this item was twice the cost of purchasing it despite it weighing less than 50grammes...increadible

280472,2,"One of the plastic clips broke the very first day. Two more broke over the next few days. The dashboard mount was useless, it simply would not stick. It did stick to the windshield, but on one hot summer day, the suction cup (which was black) melted to the hot windshield and after that it would not stick anymore. I replaced this unit with a ""Mobile Grip-It"" windshield mount (with a clear suction cup) from Walmart which works much better.The Garmin SOFTWARE is great, but this mount is NOT."
215468,0,"This is my first AEG. I do have experience fireing Tokyo Marui AEG's.I bought this gun as a beginner in the sport of airsoft. When it arrived I was excited and opened the box immediatly. The gun was well packed and contained the gun, magazine, battery, charger and silencer. The directions are terrible. The gun is underpowered if you are going to be using .20g BB's.The magazines are a bit hard to load with the included loader but hold 50 rounds each.This gun fires very nicely when using well aimed semi-auto shots. Whem placed on full-auto the gun jammed after about 10 rounds, twice in a row. I then tried placing the gun on full-auto and fire 2 and 3 round bursts and the gun jammed again.Accuracy was good until I reached about 30 feet. From 30 feet on the accuracy was reduced greatly. Keep in mind the MP5 was designed as a CQB (Close Quarters Battle) weapon.I feel like this is a good choice if you are just entering into Airsoft and don't want to spend the money on a Tokyo Marui or Classic Army. For the 25-35 dollar price range this gun is great.Just remember to only fire it on semi-auto and with timed shots."
244946,0,"I've been using Socket Rockets for the last 8 years. I bought a new pair this past summer to replace my very scratched, on-the-20th-strap-taken-from-lost-and-found-goggles pair that I loved. The goggles worked great, but the strap literally started dissolving after 3 months. It would leave a black strap mark around my head after I got done swimming and would stick to everything in my bag. I remedied the situation with a new bungie strap that I bought, but it was annoying to watch the strap dissolve over the course of a month.So, love for the goggle but buy yourself a bungie strap."

422741,2,"I hate to give anyone or anything a bad review but, being serious about my workouts and knowing how people really have to work to fit in what they can in these busy days, I have to be honest... The star I DID give is for the fact that, yes, you will get the results you are after by purchasing this video. But GOOD GODDDDD (that's how strongly I feel about this)...ugggghhhh... Anyone can get amazing results from doing every possible exercise we've ever learned since the beginning of time...A MILLION BORING TIMES before moving on to the next boring move. OMG! Basically, I would MUCH rather just have the TV on and do every exercise that comes to mind until I've exhausted it ON MY OWN but while at least WATCHING SOMETHING else. I would get the same results. This is worse than watching paint dry.I actually just took away one more star because of the fact that, in busy lives where we all want to STAY MOTIVATED fitness-wise to get in our workouts, we all need something that's not going to make us glaze over and HATE working out. I have fortunately been finding just those DVD's to keep me excited about getting mine in during the work week...this one did JUST THE OPPOSITE. It gave me a horrifying flashback of a phase when I started to glaze over and think of fitness as BORING, LONG, WORK... No No NOOOOOOO! Anyone want mine? If you pay the shipping, you can HAVE IT! I refuse to screw up the optimism I've got toward fitness due to the EFFECTIVE AND FUN workouts by even throwing this one in once in a blue moon."
128280,2,"Like a scab you would get on your arm or knee, these ""patches"" are likely to leak when the tube swells with air pressure just as a scab would crack and bleed when you bend your arm or knee. They are good enough for a temporary fix to get you out of the woods, but no further. Not one patch I used (and I used them all) held air for more than ten minutes. Absolutely not worth it, unless for the tire levers."

430677,1,"I purchased this to go with my Lansky Deluxe 5-Stone Sharpening System. It is such a life saver.

479952,2,The shirt is ok for the price. I would not purchase it as a great quality shirt! So that is what you are looking for don't hesitate in purchasing it!
287964,1,These gloves are comfortable and stretch nicely to my hand and I like the choice of colors. They don't last too long if you play golf a lot.at the start of the golf season (I live in the northern midwest) I buy myself and my two sisters gloves in varying colors and it lasts through to the fall. It's difficult to find ladies gloves that aren't white.
416829,0,"I bought several pairs because they were cheap and I just needed some shorts for the gym. I bought grey, black, navy, and green. The colors are pretty much accurate to the pictures.The material is thin, but I prefer something light-weight for working out. The elastic band doesn't bother me at all.I will say they are SHORT and SMALL. I generally wear a small and I ordered large for these (though a medium probably would have worked too). And they are very short - as in ""be careful when you're stretching"" short. I tend to wear them around the house all the time though since they're super comfortable."
261238,2,"I purchased the wedge set (including this wedge) and several other ""Texan Classics"" products on Amazon earlier this year. Instead of looking for quality used or more expensive new, name brand equipment, I opted for the cheaper ""off-brand"" Texan Classics, mostly because of the decent reviews on Amazon.I could not be more disappointed. The product is cheaply made and designed. The irons I got started breaking off the shaft after hitting a few dozen balls at the range. The woods I got started cracking along the top. The bag I got ripped and I cannot use the shoulder straps anymore. The wedges became worn within a dozen uses and the 'gun metal' coating wore off. I started using a higher quality 60 degree wedge, and I am able to control the ball a lot better than this cheap wedge set (the 60-degree wedge I got was about the same price as this set, but for the average golfer, one wedge should do you fine). Check out some pictures I took of a couple clubs and bag:[...]The manufacturer, GolfOutletsUSA, has friendly and responsive customer service, but they refused to even negotiate with any of my requests when I notified them of my displeasure in the equipment. The best they would do was replace the broken clubs--which I will probably sell or give away to someone I really hate :-)Beware of this brand! Please continue looking online--you will find a good deal, and even if you are paying a little more for something, it will be worth it in the long run!"
418170,2,"Unless you're going to use these for something other than table tennis, stay away. These are cheap mass produced balls... But they don't behave at all like a table tennis ball, not even good enough for practice. To be fair, it says practice and they're cheap, I should have known better."
481968,1,"My first Kershaw knife. But not my last. In fact, my second Kershaw has already been ordered. Blown away by the quality of this product. Extremely smooth operation. Outstanding fit and finish. Sharpest knife, right out of the box, I have ever purchased. SWEET!"
194677,0,"It's a good wristband, the pocket is super tiny- barely fits folded money and a key. If that's all you need, it's OK. The zipper is a bit tough too - but I haven't found anything else to go running with so this works for now."

They look great and when I ordered the correct ones from another location, they look great as well.If you are looking for a Cowboys license plate frame, this is the place for a great looking frame.If you are looking for a Broncos license plate frame, I am assuming the other listing from this seller with the Cowboys picture is where you should order...... (but I went with an eBay seller who offered faster shipping instead so that I could get it in time for Christmas so I am not positive)"

474889,2,"It seems to do a good job at blending between the 2 blade and the 3 1/2 blade but i can never finish because its the only blade that I have that customers constantly complain about feeling like it pulls and yanks hair.Maybe i got a defective blade.But,I keep it oiled and cleaned.It strted pulling hair from day one."
438816,0,We have to have these pants for our school uniforms. The pants fit weird. The waist is super small and the length super long and I have very tall children 5 Ft at 9yrs old. and the pants are at least 6 inches to long if I buy the correct waist measurement.
223908,0,"Looks can be decieving is the exact quote that should be used for this knife. Going off of that statement i dont know if this will affect your judgement of whether or not you buy this knife, its only my opinion.The knife is 2 pieces 1 being the actual blade and the other being the handle. as far as looks go i get comments on it all the time everywhere i have it, it always is a head turner for sure. as far as sharpness goes your gonna really have to work on the sharpness forever because it is about as dull as they come. and price you cant beat it i mean even for the looks and compliments you will get its worth it but if your lookin for a good, sharp, everyday carry around knife you should definetly go somewhere else."
82077,0,these are ok for your tween to wear under a mini skirt but they are flimsy
181287,1,"This stuff cleans so well I've often thought about buying it in bulk to use in the bathroom. Not really ...... but I hope you get the point, I use only Hoppes products on all my guns and these are no exception - they won't tear on a short barrel gun and do an excelling job of cleaning with either a rod or jig. There are thicker patches out there but for a short barrel pistol there's no reason to look elsewhere. If cleaning a rifle I'd either duble these up or get a thicker pad."
73470,2,"Easily one of the most dangerous products on the market. Its not comfortable, its noisy, and the bottom easily falls away from the top. They provide you a rope to tie it on, but in all the work it takes to get up the tree is just plain too much for the rope to hold."
48507,1,What can I say? It's a stick with a wheel! Not much can go wrong there. It's strongly constructed and does the job. As long as you realize what its for and will not give you a 6 pack in 2 weeks you'll do great with this ab wheel.
427870,2,"I bought this because of the concept which I had not seen before. I also took notice to the ""anti-deflate"" system it claimed to have.The first one I bought....yes, I said the ""first"" one inflated nicely, was very comfortable and the adjustable head and feet feature worked great.The next morning, the entire lower portion of the bed was almost entirely flat. We thought, well maybe it's stretching...so we inflated it again..the next day it was flat....we immediately ordered and received a replacement.The replacement bed was delivered in less than a week and we were very happy with speed of replacement and we got a new one!!! This one was a dud as well, but with this one....the top portion of the air mattress went flat the next day instead of the bottom portion.All the while, we keep looking at the box that promotes it's ""anti-deflating system"".....I guess mine didn't come with one.It's a great concept, east to use and very comfortable, but it wouldn't hold it's air. It's very possible that I received two defective ones, but what are the chances?"
370679,0,mine came in a totally different package than what was seen in the picture. but all and all there fine. like 3in candle each and they seem to have strong wic.
26362,0,"This thing is huge. I bought the biggest one on purpose, but I did not anticipate my use of it well enough at the time. If you are familiar with this style of rack and you are looking for a new one, this is nice and big. It is durable, but also very heavy. The weight on a bicycle is already toward the rear. If I were to buy another basket/rack today, I would go for a front rack first and then pick up something for the rear later if I really needed it. I can do my grocery shopping on with this thing though, so if you are building a grocery getter bike, this thing is an excellent addition. Bungie cords are an essential accessory for this basket, and they work very well. I did not receive any mounting hardware except for a plate that I did not need. Any nuts and bolts and washers that you need are easy enough to come by and each bike is different, creativity may be required to mount it. I like this basket very much, and I would rate it a 5 star item if it were lighter."
282343,1,Love this hanger for stuff when we go camping in May. Can't wait to use it. Looked at iKeA and they had a small one this is much bigger. Shipped fast and well packaged. Thanks
143474,1,The screws began to come loose after only 5 rounds were fired through my shotgun. Locktite on each screw seemed to solve the problem. If I hadn't noticed the loose screws they would have been lost by now. I'm referring to the four screws that attach the shell carrier half of the device to the piece that is attached directly to the shotgun.
174407,2,Waste of money. You're better off squinting with your eyes. These binoculars barely magnifies. Do not buy. Go for higher zoom.
211411,2,I was under the impression that this was a workout dvd. It is not. Sorry I wasted my money. It wasn't worth to return it for the amount I paid for the book. The description on the listed item should read that the video is not a workout video. I was under the impression that it was an instructional introduction to Zumba with the workout.
150885,0,"I bought this since the strap on my old timex broke. It works well, and is fairly easy to understand. Nothing special. I particularly like that you can adjust settings either upwards or downwards, meaning you don't have to cycle through 59 minutes to go back one minute."
453179,0,This was a gift for a friend so I never had a chance to use it. They had no complaints so I always give them three stars.
486865,1,"I like this mat, it is soft, prevents you from slipping, and is thick enough to allow knee workouts on a hardwood floor. Good choice!"

142407,1,"I have been using these and the Leightning L3 earmuffs for almost a year, mostly for shooting. I prefer these over the L3s. Even though the Peltors are rated at 29 and the L3s are 30, these have softer pads and seal better over eye protection. The difference in noise reduction between the two is not huge, but noticeable. And these are more comfortable. Both are fine, but I recommend these over the L3s if you are considering both. Either way, if the noise levels are very high I recommend using foam earplugs in addition, just to further protect your hearing."
210526,2,"If this bag were used as it's name suggests, a Ranger Field bag, it would be destroyed in no time at all. I see all these other reviews and I'm wondering if you people are actually using these things or babying them or storing them in a closet. I've used my bag for 3 flights and 6 camping trips.After the first time I used it, (which was just a car drive, 3 months of storage, then a return car ride) it had lost 2 of it's feet.Next trip, flight from Pennsylvania to California: A tear in the bottom, one more foot missing and a zipper for one side pocket start to detach. Return flight: second tear in side of bag and another foot missing. Plus the little tacks (yes, tacks!) That hold the feet on were poking out and sliced my hand open. Glad none of the baggage handlers got hurt otherwise I probably would have gotten sued.Third trip, week long camping trip. New holes, yada-yada-yada...It goes on from there. You get what you pay for usually, but this is one time when I think I actually got less than what I paid for. Cheap quality, dangerous at least to your hands.I will say this; it is a great concept for a field bag. If Maxpedition were to make one, or these guys made a better one I would pay more money for it.As is, don't waste your money if you plan on actually using it for it's design purpose, it will fail."
274150,0,I have always loved Russell shirts but my local store doesn't stock them any more. Ordered several online and was a little dissapointed. The fit was the same but not nearly as thick of a cotton as what I used to get. Delivery was quick though.
357999,0,Smaller than I thought but adequately strong. If you need a small tool kit or a ditty bag for your shaving and travel toiletries they work pretty well for that too....
354414,1,"My husband went to OSU, so I bought this watch for him. He loved it! The only complaint that he had about it was the PVC band. He really did not like it at all. We ended up going to the store and buying a $12 leather band for it. If you're unsure about the plastic band, add the cost of a new band in your budget. Also, the lady at the store had a really hard time getting changing out the band. The watch itself seems to work just fine."
149832,0,"Mine arrived flat not round. Im hopeing they shrink down properly and give a good seal, the price is good."
131212,0,"Based on the price, these things are decent Really warm, but a little on the tough side &#8211;not the most comfortable socks in the world because of the material. I found that the elasticity was a little bit lacking; at times I'd find myself pulling up the socks after they'd slipped a little. And this is all within the first 2 weeks of use, so I'm not sure how long they'll hold up on that front. The slipping isn't egregious though, it's not like the socks fall down to your ankles. I'm docking points off mainly because of the texture of the sock, which is rough, but seems to be durable."
502999,0,"this is nice and small which i wanted...I am 5'2'' and wear size 6 shoes - so it is perfect for me - however for someone who is taller or have bigger feet may find this step too compact, fyi. I am very unhappy with the quality. The top does not have any sort of non skid lining. So when you step on and off it's not smooth at all. I wish I spent the extra money for a higher quality step."
202440,1,The Stamina Elite is the latest addition to my workout equipment and has become a regular in my daily routine. It was delivered undamaged due to the excellent packing. It assembles easily in about 20 minutes. The arm exercise is a good warmup but cannot be used simultaneous with the peddle action. I had a lower back strain and this workout put no stress on my back. The seat is comfortable but is hard to adjust. I would recommend a recumbent bike for your workout equipment and the Stamina Elite is a good product.
28108,1,"These are great paddles! With them I can easily maneuver my canoe when striking out on a lake with a shallow shore and they are great for docking on those lakes as well, I have also found them useful in shallower rivers and have helped me get to fishing spots i didn't think I would make it to."
65453,2,"Just got this helmet the other day. I figured I'd get it despite the bad reviews or photos of the shell falling off...well, surprise, when it came it the side panels were off and the top part was able to come off with the push of a finger. Now I know all that part is just a shell for look, but if it comes off that easy, I'm not going to rely on it to protect my head if need be. Going to spend the extra $15 to get a better one."
75877,1,I am very satisfied with this mag pouch. Bianchi makes high quality products. I would highly recommend this product to a friend.
147285,0,"I received these blankets. I have not opened the package and tested out the blanket yet. However, I hope I don't ever have to given that these are emergency blankets. I did receive the advertised 10 blankets. Everything seems ok."
453549,1,"There were several negative reviews that I considered before my purchase. I am very happy with the ellpitical 825. It was easy to put together, smooth motion, doesn't need electricity, keeps time, calories, distance, etc. and has pre-programmed exercises with variable resistance. It doesn't make any noise and I'm very pleased."
101294,0,I purchased this for wearing at the Y during swim exercise class. This is a light exercise class so there is no underwater or lap swim. I have long hair and it is difficult to stretch this and pull over the hair. It works best when I have stretched the cap over a bowl prior to use. It keeps my hair dry if I have properly fitted cap on but it seems to stay tighter towards the forehead and as a result gives a slight headache during usage. I continue to look for the perfect cap.
347589,1,These are awesome! They are very flexible and extremely easy to adjust to the size needed. I highly recommend this product.
224445,1,"A nice compact bag very capable of storing adult skates, and plenty of room for skate guards, music cd, etc. in the middle compartment. Easy to carry. If it lasts it will be a great deal."
327631,0,"I do find these videos to be helpful in getting someone into shape. It's a nice leveled system to work through and would work well for the beginner and intermediate exerciser. If you have the structure and discipline to stick with them you will see results. I must include a few criticisms...I don't think that Ms. Siebers is meant to be an aerobic instructor. She is often off beat and doesn't posses a good consistent rhythm. She will often go slightly faster all of a sudden or will stop to talk about the moves and then join back in off beat and the background assistants have to alter to catch up. She doesn't call moves out ahead of time and will sometimes awkwardly transition without verbal warning to a new move. She will sometimes say there are 8 (for example) moves left and then do 12- then the pulse moves. She doesn't count her moves equally so you could end up doing 16 on the right side and only 8 on the left- leaving one unbalanced. Sometimes she will say one thing and do another (example- 'March it out' and begin jogging).The music is pretty bad- but there is an option to do it without music so I usually do that and play my own in the background.At this price point this tape should have been edited and these kinks worked out prior to releasing it to the public- but again, you will see results."

47409,1,Well constructed - will last many years - but are bulky and hurt my ankles when I run with them. I think they must be made for walking. Good for wrists. Overall I'm satisfied.

258527,1,"I have these for all of my rifles too. I use an armorers vise instead of trying to hold the gun with one hand and thread the weight with the other, then switch said other hand to the muzzle to grasp the weight and pull it through. The vise is a good investment and you can get one that will work fine for cleaning without going broke. These work great."
260970,0,The only reason I am giving it 3 *'s is because it is very difficult to get its belt adjusted. You have to get it done from a Authorized person. This may cost in range of 10 to 15$. But apart from the cost I found it diffcult to find such a person.Leaving that aside I like this watch very much....
456992,0,"These are a little tricky to get on and off but not too bad, may try another set, you just don't want any more frustration than you already have on the course, but for travel etc. these are great and keep the head REAL safe!"
379876,1,"I was very lucky to come across this on a gear trade site for only $50!!! It was brand new but was missing the packaging. It was a fantastic purchase!This bivy sack is phenomenal. light, dry. Just Used it first time in snow at around 3,500 ft, temps in the teens. Some very light condensation inside on awakening but otherwise very dry and does add warmth. Im 5'8 and got the normal length and have plenty of room in the bottom for boots and other necessary gear and although it is somewhat snug I could still move around when needed. Tie in point looks bomber but didn't need it. Overall impressed!!!Very light weight: 1 lb 10 oz for the normal length.The seams do need to be sealed and you have to do this yourself. Black Diamond doesn't do that for their products.Freestanding single-wall bivy design saves weight by eliminating the need for a tent canopy, fly, and poles;Waterproof breathable Todd-Tex fabric sheds wet weather and breathes exceptionally well.Optional footprint sold separately which I did purchase. I like to take really good care of my gear.Highly recommended."

The wheel is not moving and the chain is making a loud noise. He is so disappointed. I now have to drive 1/2 hour away for someone to repair it. Hopefully there will not be a cost involved.So for now, not so happy with the product."
163066,2,"When I received this knife the handle was lose at the top brass trim piece and the knife was so dull you could not butter toast with this extremely bad example of a knife and the scabbard is starting to fall apart, if this unit has a warranty I am not a happy customer!This cheap piece of garbage is not even worth sending in for warranty service it would just be another waste of shipping and repair fees and guess what Schrade YOU STILL SUUUUCK A HUGE UNIT!!! I should not have to put up with this kind of shoddy workmanship! I need to switch to a well made brand of knifes and Schrade is not it, what a waste of time and money Schrade can bite me all day every day you WEASELS!!!"
114486,0,"These are cut a little big, and that's pretty typical for a rain jacket. It feels rubberized to the touch, and does keep you very dry. There are air vents under the armpits small enough that they should't let water in-- great feature. There are also two huge pockets on the front to keep items you need to keep dry.The only thing I don't like about this jacket is that it makes a lot of plastic noise. If you're out in the rain, this doesn't matter, but any time it's not raining you're going to be ""loud"".If I am going to be wearing a jacket for rain purposes I would personally prefer the Columbia Omni-tech or Titanium Tech jacket. Far more stylish, quieter, and better ventilation, at more cost."

488966,2,"I bought this a couple weeks ago and was extremely dissapointed, it's advertised as .270 Winchester but it came as 270 Winchester Short Mag, clear as a bell marked on the package when it arrived. The two cartridges are not even remotely close in chambering. When I tried to return it I had 24 hrs by postmark for it to be accepted from time of complaint. I recieved it on Saturday afternoon and obviously the Post Office is closed on Sunday which voided my return. I believe this was outsourced thru another company and not an Amazon in stock item from their warehouse. It came from Source Media Group and they are either BLIND or STUPID, probably both! I reccomend not buying anything thru this company. My only recourse is to sell it on the Bay now, pitiful experience to say the least!!!"

388704,1,"Hi,I just want to give a quick review to save your time.This knife is good for hunting (a little big though), tactical (perfect) survival, camping.The sheet is very nicely made. Sturdy and very easy to use. Lightweight. It has a hard insert in it so the knife is really secure. If you are handy you can attach extra deals on it. It has a sharpening tool pocket on it which is very useful.Knife is nice looking, really thick and well balanced. It is not a slicer though since its cutting angle is somewhat 30 degrees. Handle is really a killer material.This knife is a big knife so the steel is aus 8. It is not the hardest but the job of this knife is not to brake. It is a good stainless blade.My only problem with it is made in TAIWAN. which is bad. Knife came with heat mark on the tip. So they burned the tip while sharpening which is a bad bad thing. I did not return it because I did not want the hustle.The powder coating was gone near the tang which means the coating is not done properly. Since the steel is stainless I did not care that much.If you want to have a single knife I recommend buy an USA or Japanese or a German knife. Rest is a 3rd class craftsmanship.For the price I recommend this knife."
488593,0,"I had recieved this model kit as a present for Christmas around 3 years ago, now I have a little time and I started to work on it. When I over the parts and instructions I noticed that the trees of parts weren't cast very well and some of the parts didn't line up well while putting it together. Most of the parts needed a lot of modification to make them even and to look good. At first I thoght that it might have been a bad batch but I had to order some replacement parts from Revell, and upon recieving them I noticed that they too were cast poorly so it wasn't just a bad batch. Over all this kit is good for a starting modeller that isn't looking to spend a ton of money on model, yes, you have to do a little work to make it look good but it was an ok model. I will say if you want a model ship that has a lot of quality look at Tamiya or another model company for a better quality model."

402767,1,"I gave this bag to a friend of mine--the type of guy who manages to break straps, tear fabric, smash buckles (he somehow managed to tear the seat belt in his car, for example). He has used this bag every day for over a year, and it's still completely intact. Love Osprey bags in general, and this one has outperformed even my expectations."
119134,1,"First, full disclosure, I did not purchase this on Amazon but at a Home Depot. But it is same product and I wanted to share my experiences with it. My problem was roaches, very big roaches. My small townhouse was infested. Open the dishwasher they scatter. Go into the kitchen they scatter. They were even trotting across my desk while I was using it and even across my bedroom carpet. Before spending whatever it costs for an exterminator I thought I'd try this since it was only $9. First, the battery powered sprayer works really well. I sprayed it all around the perimeter of my kitchen just to see if there would be any effect. I also sprayed it outside the house as well. The following day it was a gruesome scene. Literally dozens of dead and dying roaches scattered everywhere. It was quite disgusting but oddly satisfying sweeping up all the casualties. I sprayed again but this time I sprayed everywhere, all rooms. For the next three weeks I was finding dead roaches everywhere. I had not seen a live roach since then. Where it used to be I would open the dishwasher and find tens of them now nothing. I will still find a dead roach on occasion but considering I have not sprayed in months that means the toxins are still working and preventing the infestation from happening again. This product also kills the eggs too so I don't want to even think about the carnage inside my walls. I cannot say for certain that it got them all but I can say it has all but wiped them out. I also cannot attest to it's effectiveness on other pests but when it comes to roaches it's extremely effective."
103838,0,"First off the measurements are confusing, I ordered one that was too small for my bike frame and had to talk extensively with the seller to make sure I didnt make the same mistake, after paying shipping to get their wrong size pump back to them I could have gotten a nicer pump for the same price. There are other pumps that cost more, I have had those before, and if I did it again I would have forked out the cash for the nicer ones. To use this one on different valves you need to flip the head and I almost broke it trying to use it like I did my last pump. All that being said, I use this most for my presta valves and it does the job very well. But not the standard valve function does not work."
30401,0,"The RX Track Bag EXP slides effortlessly into place on the MTX track bike rack system. It slides onto the bike rack, and the plastic tab locks it into place. The fold-out Panniers allow room for a small outfit on each side; the center section has a little bit of room for food and spare tools. I think it's small enough to be light, and large enough to be useful. This is a wonderful choice for short hops. I actually really enjoyed this bag, which is, one of the smaller bags that Topeak makes. There's nothing wrong with it being small. It was designed that way for a reason. I own a number of the Topeak Trunk Bags, and this one was actually my favorite. You're not going to fuel up on fast food if you carry good food with you. The RX Trunk Bag lets you do just that. Take a kidney bean and celery salad with you instead and route your ride around the fast food junkies. You're cycling for a reason; presumably, recreation, fun and fitness. The RX Track Bag may be just the one you're looking for. Thank you for reading my review."

30649,0,"The first thing I noticed when I put these tires on is that they're quiet, soft, and sticky. They stick to the ground even after 8.5 miles of use; sticking so much as to throw up debris constantly. I couldn't get any speed on my commute with these and I felt like I was fighting wind that wasn't there. Maybe I had a bad day but there's an easy way to check where power is going - heat. The center bead gets warm to the touch after going fast down a hill. My IR thermometer says the ground was 68F, the front tire was 72F at the bead, and the back tire 76F at the bead after riding a steady 12 MPH.Unless the Overdrive needs a lot of milage to break-in, I don't see much use for them."
204834,0,"Well, I've been using it for two weeks, 30 minutes/day, and it hasn't broken. I'm worried it will, because of other reviewers and because I weigh in at 250lbs, which is the machine's maximum. If it breaks, I'll update this review, otherwise I'm having a great time!(please don't break!)UPDATE!Yeah, it broke. Specifically, the chain on it snapped (after making some loud popping sounds). To conclude, if you weight as much as me, you might only get two and a half weeks out of this thing. It's a hell of a good, low impact workout, but I think I'll wait until Instride makes some improvements before buying it, again. As of now, jogging seems to be working, but it usually puts too much strain on my joints. Sigh.Anyway,Cheers!"
44488,0,"Building it yourself is awful. Either I built it wrong or the parts were skewed, because the back part does not fit flush with the wall. Acceptable for the price, I guess. Also, the foam that is in contact with the door frame squeaks as you pull up."
20082,0,Its a nice watch and was given to me as a present. The one drawback is that the temperture function is not accurate because it is worn on the wrist and is affected by body temperture. To get an accurate temperture reading you need to remove the watch from your wrist and wait for about twenty mintues to get an accurate reading. This makes the temperture function of this watch amost useless.
34627,0,"I received my shipment on time but as others have reported in their reviews, the case arrived with two dents on the front in between two of the latches. Other than the dents, it's a really nice case and should do an excellent job protecting my rifle. I would have returned the case for a new one to be sent but I need a case now and I don't want to go through the hassle of doing a return. If I did a return, then I would be without a case for probably another week or two, plus with the similar problems being reported by others, I am guessing the replacement case would have dents in it too. Knowing my luck, I would get the replacement case and it would have bigger dents than the one I have now so I guess I'll just stick with what I have. I really think Plano should have better quality control. After all, this case isn't cheap."
266465,1,"I like this holster. It is very comfortable and fits my S&W Model 637 perfectly. My only issue is that I wear boots most of the time and having the holster with gun around my ankle makes for a pretty snug fit inside of my boot. But as they say, concealed carry is not supposed to be comfortable, but comforting. The ankle holster makes a nice addition to my main IWB carry weapon when I feel like carrying a backup gun. I would recommend this product especially at this price point."
318417,0,The Ice chest does not keep ice very long in the heat.

471348,1,"This tube is a great value. As one of the lower priced tubes I could find, I was hardly let down. Quick connect makes for easy hookup. Low profile design and sewn in straps make climbing aboard a cinch and once up the neoprene top and four padded handles makes for an enjoyable ride. I've only had the tube for a bit over a month so durability is yet to be determined but so far so good. One word of caution (for all tubes not just this one), it is important to inflate the tube per the instructions and make sure all nylon cover entry points are closed. Failure to check these often can cause the nylon cover to rip or tear. Now with all the money you saved on this tube you can buy more gas for the boat! Happy Tubing!"

The workouts in the 30 day challenge have toned my legs, abs, and upper body. I truly feel and see the difference.Cons:The program frequently misses elements of an exercise, so the reps are not counted, even with fresh batteries in the remote.The program does not use the balance board well, and I usually do the routines without it.The leg strap is pretty awkward, especially at first.The whole system feels pretty cheaply made, especially for the price."

167024,0,"We ride bikes several times per week. I say we meaning my me and my kids. So I carry 2-3 bikes on this several times per week. There are problems with heavy use. First of all, the pin that lets the rack fold down is 3/8 inch. Mine actually bent from running on the highway with 2-3 bikes. I drilled it out and put a 1/2 pin. Also, I didn't trust the threaded hitch pin that comes with the rack, it is also 3/8 inch and all that force is on the threads. If they break, by by rack. So I drilled it out to 1/2, used a regular class 2 1/2 pin and a product called a hich vise. $35 for the hitch vise, but the system works much better and is more stable. Finally, the sytem holds the bikes with flexible plastic pieces which slide on 1 1/4"" metal poles. They hold the bikes well, but they also slide on the poles resulting in bikes ending up touching and rubbing paint off each other. Since I have no idea how anyone could fit four bikes on this rack, I went with mounts for three. You can remove a screw on the end of each pole, take the end cap off and slide off or on the pieces that hold the bikes on. I took one set off and then cut 1 1/4 inch PVC pipe to keep the other three sets equal distance from each other. This is dirt cheap and works extremely well, the bikes stay put on the poles and don't touch each other. Lots of modifications for this rack but it works well now. I think I would buy a more expensive one in the future but there aren't many choices if you need 1 1/4 and all I have ia a class 2 hitch so I can't use a 2 inch hitch."

I'm usually the cut guy, so I need to hear what's being shouted at me, but its a pain to take off a headset between cuts...That said, the quality of what you hear from the outside mic is ok at best. You can hear what other people say, but there is a sort of low background static.Also the radio jack is not for your typical mp3 player, it is for a 2way radio, I think. Anyway, I thought it would accept my player, but needed to buy a $30 adapter cable to connect. Boo. My mis understanding, but they could have mentioned the jack type. you also can't change the volume of the input from the radio on the headset(only on the player, again probably not what these were designed for).The radio works well, and also the sound reduction.The Skinny-Hearing protection,and radio = greatOutside mics = okconnect to mp3 player = poor"
209547,1,"Overall I like the item, but was disappointed with the lining. It states in the description that it has a PVC lining for damp items - the reality is only the bottom 5 inches or so is PVC lined the rest is just the bag material - a little disappointing.

417844,1,Was looking for a different type of float for inshore trout fishing when I saw this one mentioned on a fishing forum.I ordered from Amazon and tried them shortly after they arrived. Works better in windy conditions than the pole floats I was using. Just make sure you put a bead between the float and swivel or the swivel will split the line tube of the float and sometimes cause the swivel to stick to the float so your bait will not go to the proper depth. Works well with a 1 ounce to 1 1/2 ounce weight on the 8 inch Big Fish Slider float.
150528,0,"It's a great work-out for the average person but it does not have that extra difficulty that the original P90X did, maybe it has to do with the long breaks between the exercises. Either way, I'll complete it and see how it goes but several days into it, I am not impressed."

I wish I could find it again for ~$45 like back in 2006 and I would buy the red color this time to keep two of the same model. I am a satisfied customer. G-Shocks are the best, I see no reason to spend money in something different. No other watch expensive or otherwise will deliver more or better than a G-Shock, period. CH"

120881,1,"I've had this machine for 3 or 4 years now and I'm very happy with it. It gives a great workout. I busted a bolt holding the vertical handles in place a couiple of years in and was happy to find it was a common part that I picked up from my local hardware store. Two hours and a tub of grease later it's running better and quieter than ever. It's reasonably self-serviceable.It's also designed with humans in mind, not your furniture, which is a good thing. I checked out machines for 18 months before I found this one and every other machine was designed for folding for storage or novelty value, with bad stride length and no life span. This one was the only home machine I found that took biomechanics into consideration rather then trying to fit it under your bed. It's great. If you want a proper resistance free workout, buy it. Btw, it mentioned above that there's a PC interface? I haven't found it but I'm going to take another look."
279359,1,"Before I get into a more thorough review let me say that this airbed has been superb and worked out great for me. I didn't want to write a review after just having received the mattress because I wanted to use it for an extended period of time before I judged its quality. It's been a couple of months and I have used it everyday since I received it in the mail. That means that the poor little pump on this mattress has been worked pretty hard. I just inflated the mattress a few minutes ago and it is still working like a charm.Quick List:Pros: Durable, firm, nice size, comfortable, long-lasting, low price.Cons: Top is made out of something that gets hot. (I addressed this by putting a small blanket between the top and my sheet)Full Review:I wanted to write this review because my father and I can't get over how well this mattress has worked out. We were both skeptical about making this purchase because the price was so low so we figured that it wouldn't last long. Also, there were a few reviews on here stating that the mattress fell apart or something went wrong rather quickly. Fortunately the mattress I received has been phenomenal, I had to write a review to give the manufacturers props and let them know that I really appreciate their product. The mattress is a nice sized queen, it sits high above the ground and my sheets fit perfectly onto it. The top of the mattress has a soft material on it that is the only thing that I don't like about it. I slept on it with only my sheets and comforter and it got really hot between me and the mattress. The next day I put a blanket between the top of the mattress and my sheet and it has worked out great since then.I like to have a really firm surface to sleep on and I was concerned that this mattress wouldn't be up to the task. Surprisingly it can get very firm. If you like it really firm I would suggest filling it up about 95%, then letting the pump take a break for a few minutes. And then turn it back on until it gets to the firmness that you desire. Otherwise you are putting an awful lot of strain on a little pump, I know that I have because I like my airbed super firm. At first I wasn't a big fan of the raised headrest but it has grown on me. I end up waking up with my pillow to my side and my head resting on the headrest with no pillow. I'll be that it's better for my posture as well.One of the best things about this mattress is that it is really high off of the ground. I can comfortable sit on the side of the bed and treat it as if it were a real bed. I didn't even inflate the little air pillows that came with it so I can't say anything about those. Who really uses those things anyways? The airbed inflates quickly and deflates even faster. I can't say how long but I can tell you that I don't mind at all waiting for it to do either.Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I want everyone who is looking for an airbed to know that this is a great bed and I want Intex to know that one of their customers is really a big fan of their products. I'm so happy with the bed that even if it broke at this point I would order another one. I've used this bed everyday for a few months and I doubt any airbed manufacturer designs these for constant use. For $50 you can't go wrong. Thanks for reading."
159075,2,"I puchased this item to use as a backup to my primary gun, and It has 3 things wrong with it.1. Its size ~ way too bulky might as well go with a sub-gun with a higher capacity instead.

Its Price ~ for the money go with somthing that has a real air supply system with it not little CO2s, I was disappointed with the range that I could get out of it.Don't purchase this item if you are serious about playing real paintball with it.

I was a bit let down by both the Silva Landmark and Huntsman (the only difference is the color if the housing). This compass has a few shortcomings for my use that Silva could have easily avoided.When I take a sighting I line up the hair line in the mirror with the index line on the front of the rotating bezel (mirror side of compass) and the virtual continuation of that line on the rear of the base plate (closest to me). This lines up my target and the compass on several points for an accurate reading.On both the Huntsmen and the Landmark The 360 degree rotating bezel has in tiny index mark on the mirror side which is dark red on a black background. It is nearly impossible to see in the mirror when taking sighting. To make matters worse the side close to me on the base plate has no line to line up the hair line in the mirror with. This leaves room for error. I guess they feel accuracy is not an issue on a compass of this size. Or it's intended for close work not distant sightings.For me a better choice for accuracy (in the same price range is the Silva Guide. It has the marks I made reference to, is a little larger and much easier to read. The Guide floats. The guide only weighs a few grams more than the Huntsman or Landmark.The Huntsman and Landmark are well constructed and open with a hinge. The Guide has a flexible plastic hinge (which has held up fine in real use). I would recommend the Guide over the Huntsman and Landmark due to the ease of reading and accuracy."

256223,0,"The lower rating is because of the horrible assembly process. 1)They sent the wrong parts - the self tapping screws they sent were the wrong size (too long and two wide and didn't match the ""parts list"") Called Customer Service who said it would take about a week for the right screws to arrive so we made ""trip one"" to the hardware store instead. 2)The directions are inadequate. (e.g. no reference to having to pre-drill pilot holes through the metal pole for the self tapping screws - this was confirmed by the call to Customer Service.) Hence, ""trip two"" to the hardware store for the right drill bits. 3) Apparently they ran out of the right size spacers because they sent 2 of the correct size and substituted 2 useless smaller ones. Didn't bother with Customer Service -made ""trip three"" to the hardware store. 4)FYI - when the package finally arrived the following week with the replacement screws, they were still the wrong size anyway - in fact they sent two different wrong sizes.The end product is great but definitely not worth the trouble."
507731,0,"I actually bought this gun from eBay but i wanted to put up a review on here too to let people know how it is. First of all the price is fairly good for a casual use gun. The weight and feel of it is pretty realistic, but after a week or so, the hammer got jammed into its pulled-back place. I can pull the hammer back farther but it will not go forward into its regular position and the trigger is also stuck along with the hammer. I've tried taking it apart to fix an internal component that seems to be loose but i can not get the gun fully apart because of the slide which is pinned into place.I'm not going to say don't get this gun because it is not like my problem will happen to everyone but I will say be cautious of what you buy.Overall, this pistol is really nice for playing with your friends or target practice and I would give it 4.5 stars if mine didn't break."

138227,0,The skates seem to be great quality for today's standards.The only issues I see are the wheels and bearings. I believe you can buy the same wheels for $8.00 total to replace. I am upgrading to different bearings since I do not think they are truly precision bearings. As far as the rest of the skate seems to be high quality which should last for many years without the thought of wearing them out. Our local skating rink wanted $86 so truly this is a bargain.

406919,0,"Got this at Bass Pro for about $40 on big sale. Seemed fine for the money for about 2 months. There are a couple of drawbacks i will discuss in a bit... easy to put up with for the money tho. Then i punched in the code one day and the door opened...the light stayed on and smoke started billowing out of it. It was fried. Oh well, I understand a certain % of all produced goods fail. To be fair, Boyt replaced it without a problem and even paid for all shipping. Took about two weeks. The replacement has been re-engineered. The door that was a little soft opening but certainly fine before now has additional springs and slams open with a loud bang. The new one is not square. You can see the bad weld along one edge of the base that warps the unit. One good change is that the door opens farther now where before it would open to just shy of 80 degrees frm vertical.Forget getting into it discreetly if you hear a bump in the night. Aside from the slamming open if you fail to hold the door, you cannot turn off the loud beeps as you press each button. I guess the led Flashing with each press isn't enough to tell you it is pressed. Hopefully it will scare a thief away instead of making him/her rush you.The key works fine and the override contacts with the 9-volt battery is a nice feature ...if you lose the key and you wait till the 8 aa batteries go dead. The first was well built and both will keep children out and safe. A teenager up to no good could make short work of it, but in my mind that is not the purpose of the thing so i don't mark off for that.I wish I had just kept the first one and used the key...&lt;Update>Boyt has since sent a replacement for the replacement. They even said to keep the original replacement for my troubles. Great customer service from the manufacturer, even if there are/were issues with the product. Item still has same issues as above. I have removed one of the springs and glued a pad on the door catch that prevents the door from opening up past horizontal. It still bounces, but softer open and less noise."

260204,0,"This mat was very good at first - it's somewhat spongy, so it grips well, even in a sweaty practice. But within 3 months of practice (90 minutes of vinyasa, 4 times a week)the top layer began to crumble. I began finding myself covered with little green bits at the end of practice. I even made sure to clip my nails extra short to be sure I wasn't making things worse. But at one year it's already worn down so that the inner plastic grid is exposed.Also, after washing it with hot water over the last year, it's gotten very stretchy, which makes stepping back and rising up to standing poses very awkward - and forget about jumping forward - I'm just waiting to do a face plant - it just wont grip the floor.I paid 50 bucks for this thing and it only lasted only a third as long as my old $20 PVC mat. I've practiced on a friend's Manduka and Manduka travel mats, and they seem much more durable. Probably a much better choice for the money."
368280,1,"Honest specs: 10"" long, 4 oz.Got this to help inflate outdoor stuff; smaller, lighter and quicker than pumps and doesn't add moisture like my lungs.1st test, 8' diameter weather balloon: about 3 minutes of vigorous cranking got it up to about 4' diameter. I think 2 half-inflated balloons wrapped with tarps or sheet plastic would make building snow shelters a lot quicker.Will check mattress and kayak later but these will obviously need a high pressure source to finish inflating; my lungs will do for the mattress but I've never tried the kayak.Yeah I know there's an ""inflator"" model but the reviews were pretty bad."
237389,0,"Unfortunately this is the older model of the Mountain Hardwear Exposure parka with ""Conduit"" not with ""DryQ Elite"".Which means you are selling us an outdated old model of this jacket.True, if you read the small print on the specs you can see this, but I guess most people (me among them...) naturally assume they are buying the current model.Its probably worth spending a few more dollars and getting the newer technology with (advertised) much better breathability."

The coat fits great and is a very nice quality. He is a size large but has long arms and the sleeves were nice and long. I bought the Bonsai color and was worried it would look a little too ""hip and snow-boarder-like"" but it is more of a muted fern green with navy detailing. For $56.00 this is a steal! Thanks, Amazon(now if you would just join Upromise)"
144904,0,"I purchased a 1978 bass boat a couple of years ago. It was heavily oxidized. I had used several componds to help rejuvinate the finish with little success. I then purchased a kit from Amazon that included this product as well as the polish and wax. I used a machine buffer and applied the oxidation remover. I was happy with the immediate difference in color and finish, however, it was just slightly better than some products that I had already used. It did a decent job of removing the years (almost 30 at that time!)of tarnish and oxidation. Last year, when I took my boat out of storage, I desided to re-apply. This time I took a 800 grit wet sanding paper and went over the entire boat by hand first. This was a much bigger job than I realized. I then used the kit and applied all three products. It was amazing to see the difference. I wish I would have done it like that the first time. I was very happy with the final results, but be prepared to use some elbow grease to get the best out of the product."

290624,0,"The tent is a good size, 7.5 X 7.5 with a square floor, allowing us to set up in smaller areas but have good space inside. Good ventilation from the Cyclone vents. The tent leaked moderately in a heavy downpour. I did not seal the seams before the trip. I'm one of those people that believe you shouldn't have to. I've had other tents that didn't leak a drop with any seam sealer applied but I will for this tent for future camps. The floor is made up of the regular tent material... nothing reinforced like in a lot of tents. Looks like it could tear or damage easily as it's really thin. I would recommend something to put underneath. The four poles to set up the tent wasn't a big deal to use but getting them through the actual pole sleeves proved frustrating, even after 6 setups.Overall though, I would buy this tent again. Slap on some seam sealer and buy a tent pad to protect the floor."

510508,2,"I was only able to use this item 3 times. I had ordered it for a 2-week camping trip up to Canada. After using it for the first three night it developed a very slow leak. I can't tell where the leak is at. There are no punchers and felling along the seam I am not able to feel any airflow coming out. When I lay on top of it it only keep me off the ground for about 2 and a half hours before my back and but start touching.

81692,0,"Overall, this is a decent little watch that does the trick without needing a cumbersome chest belt. However, there are two big drawbacks that aren't entirely clear from the product description. First, this will not continuously take your pulse -- it only measures your heart rate each time you press the buttons. Second, this downside further impacts the calorie counter. Once activated, your calories burned hinges entirely on your last calculated heart rate and so does not account for fluctuations in activity unless you continuously check your heart rate (not ideal if jogging quickly on a treadmill; riding a ""real"" bike; or using an elliptical where both arms are needed). Now going back and re-reading the description, I see ""hints"" of these downsides -- but as a first time buyer, I didn't put it all together until after I put this watch to use. But then again, if I got all this watch offered AND had the ability to continuously monitor pulse and calories, the product probably wouldn't be so modestly priced."
482616,1,"I'm not a huge outdoorsman but wanted a nice everyday pocket knife. The Kershaw's Leek fits the bill.

The only thing better than light weight in your pocket is no weight in your pocket.I find that the knife is well designed and I really like the Speed Safe opening action. It has a solid ""click"" that lets you know that the knife is in a locked position. Super sharp and the perfect drop point blade."

122243,1,"Note that this pedal is meant to be used with an amp that is on a clean setting. The pedal is meant for playing metal (like Metallica), or metal-ish punk rock (like Pennywise, Strung Out, The Offspring). It does this very well. If you don't want to buy a tube amp like a Peavey 6505 or a Mesa Boogie, this pedal will get you pretty close for far less money. Of course nothing is better than a real tube amp, but this pedal is pretty cool. I combine mine with a $400 65-watt solid state amp and I love it. The EQ is very flexible, letting you dial in just about any sound you could want. The gain is adjustable too, so you can dial in more of a standard rock sound if you want. Boss pedals are extremely well built, known for lasting typically 10 to 20 years, or even more. And that's with regularly being used all the time.I also have a Boss CH-1 Super Chorus and I put the pedals right next to each other. I can step on both at the same time and instantly switch from heavy metal distortion to a beautiful clean sound with chorus (a la Metallica), and then back."

Net looks durable - very heavy for badmitton. Closer to a volleyball net.

I use it by putting the grounds and hot water together in the bottle, then straining through the H2JO filter (cowboy coffee). It comes out perfect every time!

It does, however, work with the old GSI H2GO bottle that I have (and hate). I have not tried it with Nalgene or other brand bottles, yet. This has seriously bummed me out and I considered returning my H2JOs and DukJugs, but I've yet to find a better coffee solution.

As it turns out the ""SUPER THICK"" refers to size of card that can be inserted. The spacing between the front and back of the card holders is greater, but the actual thickness of the plastic is not. If you insert a regular thickness card into these it will easily slip out because there is so much space between the front and back of the holder."

The heel is a little stiff, but you get used to it and it's supportive.Unfortunately, I have to dock the shoe 2 stars because of the very poor construction. They were only waterproof for about a 2 weeks under light wear when the rubber edge of the shoe started separating. Even walking in low wet grass started allowing wetness in and my socks routinely got wet. Maybe I got a bad pair and the glue was old. Separation after 2 weeks though is unacceptable for a shoe this price. It has continued to separate and so has become only a summer shoe. Too bad because I think it's a comfy, great looking shoe; unfortunately it has dimmed by view of Keen shoes and I will likely hesitate if not outright avoid buying another pair of this brand."

The delivery was fast (i paid for faster delivery), no damage to the packaged bike parts, and assembly was reasonably easy, although a schematic assembly description would clearly have been helpful.The bike drives very well, the gears work fine (important for the hills here) and the bike is relatively light for a ""Comfort Bike"". Like previous reviewers, I added a bike stand and may add some battery driven lights in the back and in front for better visibility at night. Some reflectors are included, but I don't consider those sufficient. I really appreciate that fenders are included and the back-wheel one is already installed. Where I grew up we bicycle for most of our short-distance trips rather than taking a car (like the daily commute to the train station) - and you cannot know, whether the streets will be wet or it will be raining on your way back. Your cloths will be a mess driving your typical retail bike here through wet weather conditions - bikes are not simply a leisure instrument, but can be practically used in every day traffic, and thus need to be quipped with decent fenders. I have installed plastic fenders on racing and mountain bikes, and it is a pain in the ..., and they don't last long. So, this is a real plus for this very reasonably priced bike!Adding a simple assembly description would have earned this bike 5 stars!"
404847,1,The product is just what we needed. The delivery was much faster than expected. Thank you
382414,0,A good durable ball but if you're serious you should spend more for the game ball. This one stings a little.

446484,0,"I ordered this specific set of weights because of the product description and the value for the price. The weight is adjustable due to the removable bars, the size is adjustable due to the adjustable strap, and they can be used as ankle or wrist weights. While I really liked all of the options and could see that they were well-made, they simply did not fit me. I tried several times, but they kept slipping off both my wrists and ankles no matter how much I adjusted them. Thus, I had to return them. I suppose that maybe they were better designed for someone a little bigger than me, as I am a fairly petite female."

49377,0,"I had no trouble attaching this product to my mini-van. It's cleverly designed for this purpose. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. I have a standard ""women's"" bike. That is, the bar slants downward. After much aggravation, I realized there was no way my bike would fit on this rack. Further investigation found there is a bar that can be purchased (another $30) on Amazon, so I will be ordering it. My bike is very common (Trek), as are women's bike. The ad should have indicated this shortcoming."
274712,0,"The material is a little scratchy and lighter weight than I expected, but all in all this is a good product at the price. I will say they don't seem to stretch out of shape as fast as other brands.If you are looking for higher quality (and price) get the Champion version."

442614,0,"Bought this light to go along with a Radbot, Planet Bike SuperFlash and other Planet bike tail light. My girl friend commutes daily in Chicago and this light helps drivers see her. It's not as bright as The Radbot or Superflash but since it sits on the helmet it's a little better for SUV and Trucks that might not see standard tail lights. The mount seems decent and stable plus, it swivels so that the light is always visible with head movements."

349069,0,THIS IS VERY SMALL AND THE PRINT ALSO. Lots of same ol' same ole' and not very much on new. I myself was going to use it to put in pages but turns out not to be the normal size paper (8x11) but is about 4x6. I did not find any new recipes and they only use there (sirra) recipes.
195495,0,"I wear a women's size 8.5 shoe so bought size 8 skates, since reviews suggested sizing down. They were too big -- would need at least half a size larger, maybe a full size. The skate box came wrapped in a cut-down Priority Mail envelope, so to return I will need to either put it in a larger cardboard box or wrap in brown paper. The return instructions had dire warnings about not taping, marking or otherwise altering the box they come in (with the threat of a restocking fee). So return is less convenient than for items fulfilled by Amazon.The skates themselves? They're basic, inexpensive ladies' skates. I went out to my local sporting goods store and spent a bit more to get some really comfortable, durable ones instead. They even sharpened them for free. Can't get that by mail order!"
157419,2,"I really wanted this seat to work. I adjusted the position on the rails and the height of the seat many ways, but couldn't get it to work.PROS: - Nice firmness; not too hard, not too soft.- seemed to. E great quality, ESP for the money- the noiseless feature really worked. No problems with my ""girl parts.""- cost!CONS: - The square shape does not give you room on the down pedal. As a result, my pedaling would push me forward , and I kept having to hike myself back up. They should have made the seat more triangular or arched, liket he moonsaddle.- no matter how you position it, the saddle is too far forward, and that really messed with my knees..Anyway, I have a very flat butt, so that might have contributed to the proble. My husband tried it, and though he wasn't a big fan, he didn't have the same kinds of problems as I did. Obviously, this seat works for many people. If you have knee issues, I would not recommend this!"

336530,2,"Out of hot water in apt building (only luke warm water) and thought this would be perfect temp fix. Saw all the videos of stores that sell it singing high praises for this thing because it is supposedly easy to install and effective. Turns out that's not the case. Yes it's easy to install if you happen to have a shower pipe that just sticks straight out (most people have ones that bend down) and you happen to have a 30amp plug about a foot above your shower head (chord is super short). These two things are really rare so be prepared for an install to include buying a super heavy duty extension (10 guage is what my electrician recommended which happends to be quite expensive - don't use cheaper extension because he said it would cause major damage) and since the device needs to be absolutely upright need to buy buy shower elbows etc. to angle it properly. Anyways, all that extra trouble and then the thing DID NOT work!!!!"
86806,1,This toy chest is beyond amazing. I purchased for a friend who was having a baby boy and whose room was to be done in Red Sox theme. I couldnt believe the quality of this item. My husband put it together and was quite impressed. When we have kids this will definately be an item of choice!!!
83320,0,"I bought this bag just over a year ago (Nov 10, 2011) and have been using it on a daily basis since it arrived. I need to carry a lot of stuff around with me: books for school, folders and pens for work, bike locks, groceries; and I need a bag that will stand up to a lot of abuse. My previous daily-use bag was anAnvil Messenger Bag 405, and that baby held up for 8 years of daily use.Pros: The Rothco messenger bag has more pockets, which is a plus. It makes it easy to find small things like gum and pens, and I can fit water bottles into the side pockets, which allow easy access when I'm on my bike or my hands are full. There's lots of room. I occasionally have to transport a clunky 5-year-old 17"" laptop, and this bag can fit and carry it, no problem.Cons: After a year, the olive color is significantly bleached and faded to an uneven light tan. I won't lie, it looks kind of gross. I like to keep the strap shortened almost all of the way, but when the bag is weighed down with lots of heavy stuff, the little buckle on the strap will slowly slide up, lengthening the strap until it's inconvenient to carry and I have to stop, put it down, and fix the strap. The bottom of the back panel, in the corner, where it carries a lot of weight and often rubs against my body, is fraying. The strap is also fraying pretty severely, and the loose strands get caught on the buttons of my coat. If the bag has too much stuff in it, the flap won't reach the velcro fasteners and will instead just sort of flop around over everything.Take-away: It's a cool-looking bag with several pockets of varying sizes. You can fit a lot inside. But it will not stand up to long-term wear and tear. So if you're looking for something to use occasionally, and treat your bags really well, it'll be fine. If you need something durable for everyday use, look elsewhere."
35646,1,"Ordered it and they said it was on back order, So when it come on Christmas eve. I cant tell you how happy I was since I bought it to go with the Mane and braids book, Our horse lover was very happy to find this under the tree."
164349,0,"It gets the job done, but it is quite large and bulky and is difficult for one person to set up. The snap-in floor just provides some ground covering and in no way prevents insects from entering the screen room. Unless you really need to cover a picnic table, I would recommend going with a largish regular tent like REI's hobbitat."
136303,1,I finished day 5 of Insanity today and I love it. It is very intense but it is great because there are water breaks built into the workouts so you don't need to stop the video. I was really sore the first 2 days and could barely walk but I pushed through it and kept doing the workouts. By the fourth day I wasn't sore anymore. I am really excited to see what my body will be like by the end. I think if you stick to the program that there is no way you cannot get results. Good Luck!
309754,0,"This product is a very nice looking sword, that is if you just wants to look at it, it's not very strong and breaks easily. If you plan to do some serious practice with it then it won't last you more than a month, mine only last for 3 weeks and then broke."
431058,1,I haven't used this one yet but I've used the same type before and this is a great little stove for those long hike's where weight is very important. Easy to put together and cook with. A small cooking area so be careful with larger pans. Make sure your ground is flat.
36034,1,"Good product. It is heavy because it has the ""D"" rings for the harness."
393375,0,"Weaver see-through mounts and Bushnell 3-9x blackpowder scope on a newly purchased CVA Wolf. The gun comes from the manufacturer with 4 holes in the barrel for scope mounting. I wanted the scope close to the rear and could do so with this base using existing 4 holes in the gun and holes in the base. I installed this base so that it hung over the back of the barrel and over the quick release breech plug. NO problem there, still easy to remove the plug. With the base in this installed position, it also went beyond the breech plug and made contact with the rear of the gun. This is what caused the problem, a binding I could feel when pulling back the hammer. Like the base was preventing the break action from fully latching closed. No base = smooth hammer pull.I fixed this by grinding the bottom of this base that overhung the breech plug until it no longer made contact with the rear of the gun. And left it mounted on the gun in this overhanging positon. Pushing 1"" groups at 100 yards, 30+ rounds. So the base seems stable.Not a hard fix but I expected this base to install on the gun without having to make any modifications."
298539,1,"Good price. Works good. Must have for anyone with kids in the house. Handy to have right on night stand. Light inside is nice too. You can adjust to make silent so no beeping noises when you press the buttons. I did also buy the security cable which makes sense because anyone could just pick this thing up and take it with them. It's not heavy. The one thing i will say is the instructions say to attach the security cable, you punch out one of 3 hole locations where the cable can go. Mine did NOT ""punch out"" which a hammer and nail set, i had to end up drilling it. Which is not a big deal but just a heads up."
85537,1,"The pant material is JERSEY not FLEECE. Order the fleece sweat pants, if you want something heavy to keep warm outdoors in cold climates. Order these jersey pants, if you want a light workout pant that allows maximum freedom of movement with some ability to wick the perspiration from your skin. I wear these while exercising at the health club. The texture of the fabric is difficult to describe. It is the weight of a heavy t-shirt cotton, but with a hard finish for durability. These pants are better at keeping one dry during an intense workout then the old fashion heavy weight fleece sweat pants.I have ordered these pants from Amazon on three separate occasions. Yes the pants are a little large, but they are suppose to be for freedom of movement."
91987,0,"I had to get it replaced once (free!) due to a few falls (but shouldn't that be a requirement? - ability to withstand a few falls). It seems to be accurate and is discreet enough to wear on my waist without drawing a lot of attention. The 7-day memory is awesome. I need a new battery now - but it's 5 years old, so seems due."

64916,1,"I remember getting a Razor scooter 8 years ago for my birthday and loving it. When I ordered this one I saw that it came with black plastic around the joints and the back wheel. The old ones were all aluminum and felt much more sturdy. I'm sure this would be great for a younger kid, say 5-13, but this just doesn't cut it for a 6' 1'' guy, even though I am a beanpole. This is more of a toy than a transportation device. I'll be ordering the Pro edition and giving this to someone that can use it."
216051,1,The item said it was new but it obviously wasnt. The inside was covered in paint but it was easy to clean just look it up on youtube. it was also missing one of the screws (not a big deal) the tippmann logo was kind of scratched but this is the best price you will find anywhere. well woth it for 54$.
232009,0,"Do not follow the sizing chart for this item. I'm not sure if it is junior sizes or girls, but definitely not women's like it advertises. I can't rate it for anything else because I can't get them on so don't know how well they launder or wear."
307144,0,"the gun is quite good. The LED lights are blue just in case you were wondering and the lazer pointer and front grip work well. The only faults i could find in the gun were that it isnt really accurate but it is good for close quarters, and like the other review said the front grip does become loose over use"
182056,1,I accidentally ordered these thinking they were the 5.11 taclite pants. These are a heavier material that actually work better for work pants than the thinner taclite pants. They fit great and the knee pad inserts are genius!
321125,0,The picture shows 4 brushes and the title is 9mm/ 45 cal staggered leading you to believe you are getting a set of 4 brushes. It is only one brush. Haven't used it yet but not happy with the way it was advertised.

Hopefully this review will help someone else from making the same mistake I did."
313918,0,"First-I returned it since it came without a cap--poor quality control. Otherwise, it's a great bottle and good for travel. Note it's thinner than a normal 1L bottle, meaning it's naturally very tall and when full is too awkward to take for a jog--especially since there is no handle."

However, the vinyl has split in several places already, due to my accidently coiling it or bending it too tightly. Not sure if that's a design, material or manufacturing issue, and I suppose it's just cosmetic. But I'm only giving 3 stars."
392488,1,"Purchased in order to mount Flip Ultra HD to car dashboard. It wouldn't fit at first because the Flip would hit against the window (had to mount the Flip upside down, but all videos were then upside down), but I called Panavise Customer Service, provided them with the serial number stamped on the mount, and within a week, received the arm extension.It's a solid piece, with most parts being made of metal. You can rotate and adjust to any angle. The plastic suction cup stays sucked to the window. The only problem is that the mount will get shaky at higher driving speeds (the longer the extension arm, the more shaky it is), but it's not really a problem for me. You can be creative and stuff some tissue paper between the bottom of the mount and the dashboard, and viola. Instant stability. Even without the paper, it's still steady enough."
441538,0,"I just bought my second pair of Keen shoes. These have a nice wide toe area so you have plenty of wiggle room. I told my reflexologist about these and she agreed that they give your feet plenty of room. Most of us need to have our feet remeasured and get larger shoes. These are a great buy. They are nice looking enough to wear for a daily casual work environment and better looking than tennis shoes, yet very comfortable to walk around town all day. Nice, price, too.I had to downgrade my review of this product because the sole of the right shoe has developed a squeak. I've tried stretching the shoe, kicking the sole on curbs, etc. but nothing has worked and the sound has become intolerable. I've never had to toss a pair of shoes before ""end-of-life"" but when you walk around a tiled building all day with this noise it not only bugs the wearer but those around you. Hopefully this is just a one-off for this pair of shoes, because I ordered a replacement pair in another color."
232834,1,"I love this ball. Like some of the other stability ball reviews, I thought at first it was going to be too small, but it's not (I am 5'2""). The 65cm would have been too large I think. It has a DVD workout video with it. Comes with a hand pump - I used a different pump to inflate the ball faster but at least it comes with one. Like the instructions say, the ball appears small at first, when first inflating. Over the next day or so, the ball adjusts and you pump in more air.Like the color too! Would recommend."

477087,0,"I have just a couple complaints:1. The bike was barely in its package when it arrived via UPS. The bike is quite heavy and the cardboard/styrofoam packaging had nearly fallen apart. UPS said they had to tape it together and that I should set it up immediately to ensure nothing had fallen out. Thankfully, despite the holes in the packaging, it was all there.2. The set-up went quite well except that I spent TWO HOURS trying to screw the left peddle into the frame. Let it be known: ""Lefty loosey, righty tighty"" is not a universal rule. When you get to the left peddle, save yourself hours -- turn it to the left!Otherwise, the bike is solid and functional. It also looks decent in my living room. I'm a relatively happy customer."

435198,1,This is a great indoor bball! Has great texture and bounce.. I highly recommend it. Can also be a great outdoor ball as well.
196064,0,This light is nice because you can position it pretty much anywhere but it's only bright enough to navigate a dark tent and not step on someone. This is not a reading light or even a light to play cards by. And b/c it's battery operated it's not a good night light. Maybe great in a tiny 1 person tent where you could have it inches from your face/reading material but not in a family size tent.
404852,2,"When the dumbbells arrived on my porch, I could smell a rubber/chemical odor eminating from the packaging. I took them to my basement gym and opon removing them, I was impressed with the construction and durability of the weights. But that odor. After a few hours, it filled the house, giving my wife and I a headache. So I moved them to the garage. After 6 weeks, the odor has ceased and they are back in my basement. The compounds used should be reconsidered."
25877,0,"There is no doubt that the workouts are killer. I am will be headed into week 3 tomorrow but am frustrated with the lack of quality as the DVDs sometimes don't play or suddenly stop playing in the middle of your workout. Also, there is one DVD where the guy mistakenly skips doing the same exercise on the other side of the body.Exercise is hard...a love hate relationship sort of. It makes it more difficult to get motivated when you are not sure whether or not the DVD is going to play or 'freeze' periodically.Again, the workout is terrific if you can put up with inadequate DVD quality."
422713,0,"I bought this monitor a year ago. It is a good monitor and does a good job reading my heart rate. The extra features on the watch are nice as well. The only complaint I have is that the plastic latch that hold the elastic piece to the monitor strap you see here cracked and broke early on. I used it nearly every day for a month before it happened. I've made do with a little velcro loop, but expected the original product's system to last longer."

130870,1,"I golf on a course that has lots of water, and my 15' ball retriever wasn't doing the job. I scoured the Internet for longer ball retriever. I came across the ""Search and Rescue 24 foot"" I even watched a little video of it in action. Now with that said they advertise that you can just run the cage across the bottom of the water hazard and come out with balls that you don't even see. This might work if there was no plant life or a foot of duck poop. The ponds I use this in are full of algae, weeds, and mucky bottom. This causes the cage to clog up and keeps balls out. If your water holes are lined with sand or small pebbles you should be ok, you can blindly sweep away. Now with that said I love this retriever, if I can see the ball I can lock it right into the cage. It takes a little practice to get the hang of using it. We went out at night with a flashlight and pulled 100 balls in about 30 minutes. Full extended this thing turns into a wet noodle, but as long as you can get the cage right behind the ball your fine. As soon as I got it I took out the cheap rivet holding the threaded stud that cage attaches to, and replaced with a cotter pin. I was afraid the rivet would not be able to handle a good tug if I got it hung up on a rock. The handle locks nice so you can set it to different lengths. It fits in my cart bag ok and doesn't look as bad as I thought it would. I am very happy with my purchase, and if I ever break this one I will get another. I did look at the two ball cage version, but now that I have it I think I'm glad I got the 4 ball version, just because it easy to see, not that I have ever pulled up 4 balls at once."

291463,1,"It's a metal bottle. It's made to transport liquids for our consumption.It doesn't get much more simple than that, but there's always things to get picky about...I chose this over Sigg bottles because I didn't want enamel to pop or flake off (possibly inside) after a drop or fall. I wanted a slightly wider mouth, too.To be brutally honest, SS still releases _some_ chemicals into whatever liquids it holds, but so little that nobody seems to mind. Realistically, we inhale far more toxic substances than we would get from our water bottles, aluminum or stainless.I don't like how the caps are plastic. I could care less about the plastic-leaching issue, I just like metal caps because they don't tend to get messed up as much as plastic caps do, in my experience.I like how easy it is to clean. A splash of vinegar with some water, a shake, and it's fresh and ready to go. (I wipe the mouth, though). It also doesn't get funky like my old Nalgenes did.I haven't tried it with my purifier, and that's one thing I miss about my Nalgene bottles, as they provided a perfect, no leak seal with purifiers in areas with questionable water. I'll report once I get my rear in gear and test.Currently, a good choice out of a very limited field. I'm sure others will come along that are just as good -if not better- that cost less."
262656,0,This Workout DVD is just OK. It was fun and I really like the instructor.
223687,0,Okay- so I didn't get what I ordered. If I did- this would be a 5 star rating. The glasses don't look like what's on the picture. I don't know if Amazon messed the order up or what. I didn't get the modulators- I got polarized ones instead. Otherwise- the frames look the same. For right now I like em- but the real test would be to see if my husband likes these more than his old (broken) modulators that I was trying to replace.
156659,1,"I was super excited when I first saw this product, and I must say I've had no issues since I've received it. I do a lot of moving around with my job (good wheels required) and I have not had an issue with the ability to roll, but at times the locking clip locks when I unintentionally hit it with my foot. That's my only minor issue, but has been fixed with black tape. The ball is study, and the frame is great. I like that it came with a booklet to show you different simple exercises to do with the ball.The reactions I get from co-workers is WTF are you sitting on? But after explaining the benefits of sitting on a ball, and having them try it out they all agree it was a smart purchase. I feel my back, and abs becoming stronger. I also don't have as many neck issues. Gaiam did excellent work with this product."
286528,0,"These shorts are fine for exercising and running, except that I expected them to be a little longer so they would hide my skinny upper legs - they didn't. A nice feature of these shorts are the pockets."
465701,0,"Heavy watch should be worn so it can get sunlight. Should be set on window sill at night so it can update it's time signal. If you work the night shift or explore caves, it will run down. Should have used my money better....."
72903,0,"The sweatshirt material, construction, quality is fine. The picture and description of &#34;vintage navy&#34; however are WAY off. This color is navy, period. It looks NOTHING like the soft, garmet dyed looking sweatshirt shown. Do not waste the extra money going with this one. Very disappointed."
72947,0,"This is nice quality. My only problem with this is it does shrink some in the dryer. It wasn't a terrible amount. However, I should have bought the next size larger. This was just a nice fit before washing and drying. Actually wouldnt have hurt this sweatshirt to have been slightly larger to begin with. After it shrunk I gave it away. I am buying more of these! The material is very nice. I am ordering a larger size."
243086,0,Used to buy these all the time now the material is somewhat flimsy and thinner than previous RA tee's. Would recommend seeing a store sample before purchasing. My ten year old RA's are more substantial after hundreds of washing and machine drying. The size is a little small for a large so avoid dryers if want it to last awhile.
182340,0,"I was hoping this swim cap would be big enough to fit my very long, thick hair into. It turns out it is not nearly big enough. I bought it so I would be able to swim without getting my hair very wet since we all know chlorine dries out your hair, but unfortunately it leaves about two inches of my hair exposed in the back. Pretty disappointing."
360690,1,"THIS PRODUCT IS SURPRISINGLY STURDY AND EASY TO PUT INTO ACTION. HOLDS MY FEET A LITTLE HIGH FOR MY LIKING, AS I'D PREFER A GRIP CLOSER TO THE ANKLE, BUT WORKS JUST THE SAME. A FEW DOLLARS CHEAPER WOULD HAVE MADE THIS A FIVE STAR FOR THE MONEY."
19877,0,"If you're depending on this product in a a SHTF scenario, you've chosen poorly. If there is a situation where you're going to be fending for yourself over a long period of time, why are you getting a watch that runs on batteries? You'll be EXTREMELY lucky to find replacements. Is looking for watch batteries going to be high on your survival list? Hopefully not. Get a good mechanical watch that winds itself. And learn to use a compass."
268435,0,"This is a very effective arm, shoulder, and whole-body workout. It should appeal to folks who want something different, especially if picking up a bokken (Japanese style wooden sword) for the first time. You will have to concentrate, which helps the hour fly by; you will get sore; you will have the fun of swinging a sword. ('Ware blisters, the first time or two.)Sword nuts be forewarned: this one goes in the ""inspired by budo"" category. She actually - get this - SWITCHES HAND GRIP at intervals, moving the right hand down and the left nearer the tsuba. There's a wide-stance squatting movement (somewhat horse-stance-like) with a shomen cut that also spoils the illusion that you're practicing real technique. Other things that drove me nuts (the wide-open left elbow of the horizontal cut...) might be legit style differences, but after a while staring head-on at brisk, repeated shomen cuts and aerobics-derived footwork, I began practicing counter-movements in time with their attacks, instead of mimicking.If a great workout with a unique flavor is what you're after, go for it. If you practice Japanese sword - especially its aiki variety, which is what most bokken-owners probably do in the U.S. - be aware that this is a very original, and clearly conditioning-only-oriented, interpretation which will not reinforce what your sensei is teaching you (although it ought to give you a great physique to walk onto the mat with).Final note, though: COOL pants. No, really! And much less hassle than hakama, I'm sure."
203324,1,I bought this for my husband for work. We had bought many other products for him. This is the best he ever had. Love the clip to secure it anywhere he needs it to be. Excellent product and price.
419421,1,This shirt is absolutely beautiful! I would buy this again in a hearbeat. Fits nice event though I not one of those skinny little guys and I am not one of those great big belly guys. The shirt fits nice on a large built person vehicle nicely.
159458,0,I like being able to purchase gloves in so many colors but have found the life of these gloves is short. Wear on the palm quickly.
182912,0,"My husband likes this style for his lap swimming. Speedo has changed the stock number, so it took a while to find the new number. Also, Speedo must have changed the dye process, because it starts to fade after one use in the pool. Current versions only last about two months at three times a week use."
292964,0,This bike was a birthday present for my 4 year old son. Overall the bike is a good value. But the one thing that is hard not to overlook is the bike's weight. This bike is very heavy.
374320,1,"I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter to use for naptimes when I started taking care of a baby at their house. She loves it! My daughter does not sleep easily in strange places, but having her own bed with Dora on it made the transition very easy. We'll be trying it out at my sister's soon. We've yet to use it overnight, but will definitely bring it on our next overnight trip. I highly recommend it!"
279247,2,"Well, at first, I was really satisfied to buy it at this price with free shipping, and it looked good when it was inflated at first time when I bought it on Last November, I thought it should have been used at least half a year or longer, but it was totally a kind of tragedy, after the first month, the bed became out of shape, it should have been kept in rectangle, it became a round one, ok, I didn't care about it, anyway, it still worked functionally. But things went worse, until last week, it automatically deflated when I heard ""bang"", I was so scared,i could not figure it out what was wrong with it. Thus, if you really need a bed, choose a really mattress and bed box, not like me who just want to make it temporary, the truth is the inflatable bed cannot last long, the quality of this stuff really sucks."
232948,0,"I ordered this watch to use during my Army Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS) 20 Nov-13 Dec 2001 class. My intent was to use it as my primary compass, just as I had the used my Suunto 'analong'wrist companss as my primary during IOBC and Ranger schools. The Advizor failed me in that aspect. Its North pointing arrow is a digital dot, opposed by a digital &quot;tail&quot; of three dots on the south side, making it a cool tool and a toy, but not a precision instrument. Hence, I could not rely on such a civilian system to earn me my SF selection. I ended up using the army issue compass to find my points on the STAR and the TREK. Since then, I use the compass when I am driving, or when I am lost in the underground road system in my city, where the Sun is not visible.As for other elements, I use the heart rate monitor for my runs. That is the most use that I get out of my watch. But it is very very complicated, in that I have yet to learn how to opbtain the highest pulse, as well as the average pulse per workout.. The altimeter and barometer functions are useless to me, as the terrain in my area is so diverse, that terrain association alone can locate me within 50m of my location.So for you soldiers out there, Suunto analog wrist compass (do not recall the actual name) that is available in AAFES clothing store is your best bet for compass. This watch is useful only if you are out to get a heart rate monitor, but wouldn't mind paying a bit extra for a &quot;last minute back up compass&quot; that also shows time and air pressure. Oh, it is water resistant only to 30 meters.. So you NAVY SEALs and SF Scuba dudes, stick to your G-Shocks.Krusader, Out."
308159,1,"We bought this to take our bikes to the beach and camping. My husband thought it would be difficult to put together. Everything was easy and it holds our bikes steady. This bike rack works great, even for 3 bikes."
227357,2,"I was looking for the wet'n'wild pictured. I even called and they assured me it was it. When it came it was a different, smaller tube. Part of this is sportsstuff's fault, they use the same model number with different sized tubes. The seller wasn't super-easy to work with, since it was so large I'd be paying a huge shipping fee, so I just kept it. It's a great tube, shipped fast, too bad it wasn't what I asked for."

79236,0,"This is the second Columbia fleece I have owned that the zipper comes undone all the time. It though the first one was a fluke, until I bought a new one and had the same problem after only an hour of wearing it. I love the warmth and feel, but I don't think I will be purchasing anymore."
28799,0,It's not like the one I used in the Physical Therapy office. It's o.k. I'm hoping eventually to be able to get more use out of it.
85248,0,"nice sleeping bag very comfortable, almost impossible to get back into the bag. it took two of us and still only got it half back in."
66376,1,Very good tool. Have used it on my days sailing and at work.Easy to use and waterproof. The temp. function may not be quickand you must hold from the sides so not to read the heat from yourfinger. But in summary for the price can't beat it.
101859,0,"This cap was smaller than I expected. I'm hoping it stretches in the water, because it can barely keep on my hair in (I have medium-long hair). It does serve it's purpose, though. I use lycra because it feels less constricting in the water than silicon, and I get headaches less often while using it. My head also never overheats when using lycra.Color-wise, since I got the black one, it was... well, black, so no false advertising on the color on my part.All in all, it serves its purpose."
449494,1,"I have and will compare this item to theJugs Instant ScreenI have a 7 year old boy and 4 year old girl. They use this screen for batting off a tee and soft toss. They also use the strike zone target for working on throwing accuracy. I am 37 years old and I hit off the soft toss as well, so it gets hit hard and soft.I coach my sons under 8 baseball team and we will use this and the Jugs product during practices.I have the 5x5 Foot net and would strongly recommend that you get the 7x7-foot instead. The 5x5 works, but having that extra 2x2 feet would be a huge difference.The assembly and take-down for this is quick, easy, and straight forward. This product beats the Jugs Instant screen in this aspect. I always dread folding up the Jugs net.The quality of the netting has nothing on the Jugs product. Jugs has a very durable netting while this has a softer feel to it. I suspect that the netting on this will give out well before my Jugs net.Strike Zone Box on this is much better than the Jugs. The Jugs version is just a hanging box/outline. This one is complete with a net to catch the strikes and attaches to all four corners rather than two straps.Because this net is square shaped, it will also be handy for my kids soccer practices. The round Jugs net is not useful in that situation.Including four good quality ground stakes is a great touch and makes this complete right out of the box. The Jugs net came with four good screw type stakes, but I ended up purchasing my own U shaped stakes similar to what came with this net.In the end, I think this and the Jugs nets are good, but if I were to purchase another one, I would definitely buy the 7x7-foot SKLZ Net for the ease of setup/take-down, strike-zone net, and multi-sport use.I will update my review late spring when our little league baseball season ends to update on the durability of the net and the product as a whole."

345444,1,"My wife bought this before our family trip to Mexico. I wore it all week and kept cash, credit cards and our hotel key in it. This wallet kept everything dry and was comfortable around my neck."
288417,1,"Excellent glue, one I use along with Tenax 7R, Pro Weld and testors. A must have for the hobby box"
56206,0,"It moves around a lot when I try to use it. I've had to go to home depot and buy a clamp for it to permanently hold it on the ground without shifting around too much. Maybe this is good if you want to go slow, but once you start trying to pedal fast, it shifts around a lot. The build is good & sturdy though so maybe it's just meant for something not as intense as a slow workout."

61578,0,"Overall, this is a good product. However, if you are used to drinking water out of a Poland Spring's bottle, and you drink a lot of it, then this product is going to be a bit tough for you. I like the fact that I am saving the environment, but the amount of water that comes out of the tip is minimal compared to taking a good sip out of the PS bottle. I am trying to get used to the smaller amount that comes out before I end up not using it at all! It is great, however, that it is leakproof...so no more spills in my car or my bag!"
33303,0,I have a tactical shotgun with a scope and it does not fit with the scope attached. This case is made of thin plastic and we will see how many trips I get out of this case. But for $40 it will be what it is.
313134,0,"The label looks great. But, it is very difficult to put onto the buoy. The directions are ok, but it is very difficult to get the label on even because the labels are two seperate pieces, and it would be much easier if it was just one larger piece. Just take your time, and plan on possibly having to apply more then one time if you don't get it correct the first time."
130264,0,"I like the idea and the color, but it is not necessary for me to have a latch back looping system. I cut out the plastic and made it a simple velcro loop that I had to mash together with the end sticking out sideways. Just have it overlap and put the velcro on opposite sides so it can secure."
398667,1,The Schwinn arrived via motor freight in perfect condition. Two persons put it together in about one hour. It is quite and smooth. If it holds up it is well worth the money.
480767,1,"bought as a birthday present for daughter who ""broke it in"" this weekend. Both my daughter and her fiance' liked this item, and better than any they've seen at stores such as Wal-mart. My daughter loved the different pockets for storing stuff such as maps and snacks; and for being oh-so-practical, this bag is really sleek-looking and easy to carry. I first felt it was a bit pricey, but now am really glad I bought this pack and would gladly buy another if, let's say, fiance' feels he needs his own! As for the color chipotle, represents their favorite fast food place...also looks good in nature surroundings."
109697,0,"The wife ordered the Smooth 5.25 back in August '05. Late last year, Oct. '10, the incline stopped working. Due to laziness, I didn't check into it until Jan. of this year, '11. I took the top cover off and discovered the mounting bracket for the incline ball screw motor had ripped from the front square cross tube lateral frame support where it was mounted. The weld on the mounting bracket did not fail as I would have thought, the actual tube steel failed all around the mounting bracket. After several phone calls with Smooth Fitness customer service and emailing pictures of the failure, Smooth replaced the 5.25 with the newer 5.65 approx. 3 weeks later. S+H was free as well. I had to be persistent to get action but they did honor their warranty and I received a free replacement treadmill. The 5.25 still works minus the incline which I will work with my father in law and welding machine to fix. Smooth did not want the old treadmill back."
102590,2,Russell Athletic Men's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts. When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms. Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing. The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent. This may have been a problem with one assembly organization.

194205,1,"I originally had a glow in the dark frisbee, but after an hour, the ""glow"" would be almost completely faded. Awesome at night time, floats great. The material is softer than the usual Ultimate discs, so forehands are a little different if youre using this as an actual Ultimate game disc for night time. We just did a full glow-in-the-dark game with 2 different sets of glow wristbands and necklaces, one for each team. A lot of fun!"
153686,0,"The product itself is good - the quality seems to be OK so far. Positive: Recieved order and shipping information for the shipper (unsolicited updates). The negative: The item weighed about 1 pound (probably less), was shipped via postal mail, and took about 1 week to ship. Considering time, weight, and method shipping charge from this comapny was high at $5.25."

219280,0,"This is a great item for saving on the amount of coffee you need to make a pot. If you like strong ""Man Coffee"", this will brew it right!in our normal BUNN coffee maker we use to use 10-12 scoops of whole beans (ground of course), with this coffee maker we only need 6-7 scoops of whole beans for the same amount of water. The only complaint we have is that we need to use a heavy duty binder clip to keep the top of the ""basket"" on so that the coffee grounds don't push the lid up and allow the grounds to spill over the side of the basket into the coffee. We like strong coffe but not coffee that is gritty."
279890,0,"My brother ordered these for my son to go with the scooter he got for his 3rd birthday. They're too big for him, he's literally right in the middle range for a 3 year old in height and weight. The elbow pads would have probably worked on his knees but that defeats the purpose of having the set so exchanging them for something that will be more likely to work as a set."
357093,0,I've purchased this rope many months ago and quick came to realize that it would slow down in mid flight. After reading a few reviews I seen another customer talking about how the rope would rub against the handles and this messes up the rhythm.I figured I would do some more research and find out what MMA fighters using something with long handles and thin looking wire. I believe I've located the company and the jump rope they offer look incredible and I'm looking to purchase it after writing this review.If you want a quality jump rope I would suggest that you look into the SR-1 Rogue Bearing Speed Rope; they look amazing and are build for speed and durability.

492298,0,"I am happy with the bags though they did not have the closure flap as described. They are exactly large enough for an 8x10 with a flat opening at the top. There is no method to close the bag so it does not do well for long term storage.Clarity is good though I would not call it crystal clear.It is a thick plastic, does the job of protecting though you need to watch to make sure you art does not slip out.I used it for matted art and the matt fits tight in the bag so there is no slipping."
459817,1,I've found that this seal cock works great with keeping the dirt and random things that work thier way into the brech. It's easy to install and doesn't add any weight to the gun at all. I'd say its one of the few mods that really are worth getting for your Tippmann
362647,2,"These goggles were ok for the first two swims during which I used them. But the outer frame quickly tore. Now after three swims, they are useless.Oh yeah, and tonight I saw a guy with a pair of them have the exact same problem during his first swim with them."
173743,0,"I discovered a great way to mount this very inexpensive mirror for maximum efficiency: the plastic mounting bracket is flexible enough to mount it on the END of the handlebar, thus turning it into an end-mounted mirror with a GREAT view of the road behind you. You just need to secure it with a twist or zip tie as the bolt provided will no longer work, but that's easy & cheap. So far, after a few rides, it works great, very little vibration, etc. The only drawback: the convex mirror does distort distances quite a bit, but it does provide a very WIDE view of the road. Certainly worth the $4.39."
178515,2,"Unfortunately, this item was too tight for my big head. The frame width of my current glasses is 133cm just to give you an idea."
10894,0,"I like the cut of the vest and the cattail color is pretty well represented on my monitor - maybe more of a rich brown than the rich maroon-brown I saw, by a slight margin. There's some reddishness. As many others noted it's a thin fleece, so it might not be the best value for the $30 I paid in my size. Whether that thinness becomes a longevity issue or not I'll have to see."
420720,1,"Well made device.I bought the chest expander too. I think that the two combined make a great system.I now have two sets of handles and many cable options.But if I could only buy one of the two pruducts it would be this one.With some imagination, many good strengthening movements are possible with this."

391109,0,"What I like about this knife is the light weight, the grippy, comfortable handle and the fairly good cutting one can get from it.What I don't like is that it's difficult to sharpen. It has one loooong edge and it's easy to imagine that one has to take off a lot of metal to get to the edge. That means either a coarse stone or a long time stoning. When folks refer to easy sharpening I suppose they mean that it's easy to hold at the right angle while sharpening. But that's precisely why it's difficult to sharepen as well.The blade is skinny. It will flex, and with any kind of hard use, I suppose it will break as well. That's not exactly the kind of knife you would want to rely on. In my mind that makes this knife an 'around the shop"", work, or every day knife. It should do well in that role.The finish on the knife is rough. That's not important to what it does, but if you take delight in a quality piece you won't be happy. On the other hand, you won't regret abusing the knife somewhat because of that very feature either. Then on the other hand again, you can't abuse it too much because it is too weak for that.So, to sum up, a good knife for the price with serious limitations. The limitations are that if you use it for bushcraft, then it's the occasional camping trip or weekend in the woods by your house or a well traveled park. The primary use for a knife like this is where if you break it or damage it to the point of unuseability, you can reach in the drawer and replace it with another. That's omething you can do with this knife, as it's cheap enough to get several for the price of a higher quality knife."
369734,2,"I've depended on this box to protect my phone, fob and wallet for many years while sailing. When it counted it failed. In a capsize it leaked ruining my phone! (I suspect it leaked through the relief valve.) Going to the manufacturer was no help. I just got the shrug and sorry response. They put me through the RMA cycle with no results.

216578,0,"I bought this tent just before I left for a weekend trip. The first night we experienced three huge electrical storms/torrential downpour/ tornado winds, no joke. Possibly the worst weather for a camping trip to the dells. The tent held up fine. We did get a little wet but considering everything the tent was ""the bomb"". NOTE: it would have been helpful to put a nice tarp over the tent if I had one. The rain-fly comes off and 3/4 of the top of the tent gives a great view of the sky and allows for plenty of airflow. The tent is also big enough for a queen size air mattress, also very helpful. For light or moderate camping weekend style, you can't get a better tent for the price. If you can spend more and get something that looks a little more modern but would have to spend much more to get something functionally better."

136066,0,"Perhaps in another life, Shawn T was in charge of the Spanish Inquisition. Mercy is not his specialty. Most workouts get significantly easier after a month of mastering them, but this business stays painful. I remember sweating like a garden hose and wondering if and when I was going to be able to keep up with these jocks as memories of being picked last for PE haunted my every power-jump.As someone who's maintained about a 70-80 pound weight loss for a number of years, fitness is a huge priority and I work out a lot. It's a part of my life, not something I binge on occasionally. Without fitness, I'd gain my weight back and be miserable. Like a lot of people who used to be obese, I dream about the day when my abs will be cut, when I'll look like a fitness model and there'll be no evidence of the fat childhood and teen years I endured. Because of this, this series has a lot of appeal. It's extremely athletic and cardiovascular. It relies on plyometrics, proven to be effective for fat loss. The moves combine strength and cardio so that you don't lose muscle mass. It uses your own body weight as resistance, so no equipment is required. The workouts are extremely time efficient. However, its appeal is also its setback. It's designed to really get you ripped rather than to be something you do every day for the rest of your life.After a month, I started to dread the workouts. They still seemed hard and... not fun. They were demanding on my joints. I felt like I wasn't seeing the results I saw when I did workouts that combined strength AND cardio/plyo. And I'm a 29 year old woman who runs a 7 and a half minute mile, so I'm not exactly out of shape.It dawned on me that there was no way I'd be able to do this workout for months or years. I quit the strict ""program"" and now use the workouts occasionally to mix up my routine. Why? I'm a lifer, not someone who wants to get in shape for a particular event, and this ""insanity"" of intensely difficult cardio would be impossible to sustain forever.I have no doubt that this will absolutely work if you actually do it. But will you do it? Or do you just think you will? I hope to one day join the ranks of brave and successful people with 6-packs. But after a month of eating raw kale and power jumps, I felt a bit bummed out. Shawn T, I'll always have a place for you in my heart and in my rotation. But if you're like me and you're looking for ways to maintain your weight loss rather than get ripped for a special occasion, I recommend you mosey along."
134711,1,"Why didnt I think of this when I was in the army? It's a good tool for field maintainence of a rifle, gets its mostly clean. This shouldn't be seen as a replacement for a good rod and brush, but with this bore snake I find I can keep the rifle in the field in a good state of cleanliness quickly, which encourages me to clean it more often. Because the snake is easy to use, compared to a rod, its easy to just do it whenever you have some downtime.Just a great little invention."

I do, just because I am ""old school"", but I sure don't worry about pulling another one out. Have had some that were much more expensive not work near as well."
283713,2,The tent itself seems to be decent for the money. It went up with no trouble and appeared well made. The problem is that on my first night in the tent it rained. The rain fly simply does not adequately protect the window and door. I had the window and door both open for ventilation (screens in place of course) and rain dripped right in and I ended up with damp bedding.The next evening was dry and the tent was fine. The tent packs small and light and I appreciated the two removable mesh storage bags on the walls along with the mesh shelf in the ceiling - which is where I kept my phone and wallet so they would be sure to stay dry.I'd skip this tent if you camp in wet conditions. There are certainly other comparable tents out there with better rain protection....

360135,0,"I cancled this order a couple of hours after I placed it. They said they needed more info to cancle which i gave but the order was sent anyway. They told me I could send it back, of course at my expense. I really feel like I was ripped off, and it makes me hesitant to order anything else!!!"
245082,0,"This is a good product and I only wish it also came in a ""wicking"" or moisture moving weave/style. I always buy Russell if it is available."
118222,1,"This is a great little respirator.We painted approximately 2,900 square feet worth of apprtments with it, and it works just as advertised."
224106,1,"I decided on these over a much more expensive pair of Gore-tex overpants for a week-long odyssey through the rain forests of the Pacific Northwest. Most of the rest of my group went with the overpants and Neo overshoes... in the end I was nearly as dry, and much more comfortable than the rest. The real proof of quality is that the ""guide"" in my group and all the other guides (guys that do this professionally) were wearing this exact gaiter.TL;DR:Pros:Well made, waterproof (ended up shin-deep in a marsh without complaint), and the fit was excellent (10.5 boot, Large gaiters).Cons:A flaw inherent to gaiters: they wick moisture up to the (on me) knee area of the pants.It's difficult to get them on perfectly straight thanks to the little metal hook at the bottom of the closure."
485890,2,THIS ITEM WAS KEPT IN THE BOX UNTIL I WENT CAMPING WITH MY 68 YEAR OLD MOTHER WHO NEEDED THIS MATTRESS. I BLEW IT UP AND IT DEFLATED WITHIN 30 MINUTES DUE TO A HOLE IN IT. I AM NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH THIS COMPANY.
67589,0,"Installed on Motorized 26"" Schwinn 3 wheel. Love the looks, speed is a little off and no way to adjust it. Had to remove a bearing tensioning nut for it to fit between forks (didnt like that) no way I could spread the forks more that 1/4"" to get wheel on. It does work though you just have to make a mental correction to speed and distance. Odometer is realy just a trip meter."
278476,1,"This is a great safety item to own. We put it out in the middle of our cul-de-sac and it is very visible. The color is eye catching along with the height and bright flag. All of our neighbors have commented on how easy it was to see from a distance so that they can slow down and are aware of the kids well before they get up to where we are. You can never be too safe. We looked at other safety signs, but found this one to be the best."
217947,2,I bought this in Jan. 2012. Started using it in May by Sept. the adapters quit working while I was on a camping trip. As amazon is the only place I can find the adapter at a reasonable price-I'm buying two this time.

225032,0,"The picture on this listing is wrong. The listing is for a red sox HAT, not a baseball. I recieved the hat and notified the seller that the picture was wrong. I decided to keep the hat because it's actually pretty cute. It's glass and shiny and a good size ornament, about as big as a 3-3.5 inch glass ball ornament. I only gave it a three because the listing was wrong and I would liked to get the baseball, but it was unavailable."
419649,0,these are ok for your tween to wear under a mini skirt but they are flimsy
372432,0,The product itself is great and I love the versatility of the buff. The color shown and what I believed I was purchasing was solid chocolate brown however what I actually received is brown with a white paisley print.
170028,0,"material is thin, I probably wouldn't havebought this item in person."
507281,1,"This gun is well worth the price! It is heavy and the plastic is very high quality!

267288,1,"This is a high grade almost pro ball set for school use and great for out door rough use. Great toy, your kids will love it."
216244,1,"I really like the heart rate monitor and it works great. As has been said, it takes some time learning all it does, but it's worth it in my opinion. The only thing I was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit, but from what I have been told by others and their brands of running watches, they all do this to an extent. Everything else I'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone. The distance reading has been right on the money after calibration."
53537,0,"Nice quality band (green: medium/heavy resistance), but 13"" loop (13"" laying flat) is too large to be effective for my knee strengthening physical therapy exercises, rendering it nearly useless. I barely get to its stretching point. I have a small frame (5' 3""). Using the loop on my ankles, feet hip width apart I barely reach the loop's stretching point."
263915,1,"This is my second product from Gunvault and like the first one they did not disappoint. Excellent quality and great for travel. Keyboard works extremely well, tie down cable is helpful, and the rubber feet keeps it from sliding around. I can fit a Kahr PM40 and a mid-size 1911 in it at the same time. Highly recommended."
348105,0,"I bought these for the Gold Toe quality, as their toes do not wear out as all other socks I've tried do in one wearing. My toenail does not cause a hole upon first wearing, so Gold Toe is excellent. BUT, I needed to replace all my thin running socks, as my running shoes are tied perfectly for thin socks. These are labeled at thin liners, but have a bit too much padding on them. I have to re-lace my shoes every time I wear these, so I am going to toss these and look for the thin ones. I also bought the ""Gold Toe Women's 3-Pack Flat Knit Liner Athletic Sock"", which are 60% Combed Cotton/39% Stretch Nylon/1% Spandex, and these are perfectly thin for running, with no excess padding. I am now in search of low cut socks just like the ones above.I gave these 3 stars because they are great socks, but I would not call them liners."
108779,0,My daughter love it but now my seat can't attach properly. It would probably be ok for a taller person.
455748,0,My 10 yr old son (70 lbs) got this for Christmas and he liked it but it was too short for his heighth so I returned it to Amazon and was charged a $6.14 restocking fee which makes me mad! I had to pay for return shipping which wasn't cheap either due to size of box. So make sure this is what you want so you don't have to return it & pay the restocking fee.
75841,0,"Got these for BP based on price. After about 2 months of BP, find these don't fly nearly as far as other 44/375 balls. In the BP bag I have Thunders and Sharks, and they typically fly about another 40-60 feet. They seem to be OK as far as durability..."
337342,0,I am using it for the past 1 year and found no issues with it. Note that there are other cheap pedometers in the market. I suggest to give it a try.
291367,0,"Thanks Kanteen for keeping me hydrated while looking eco-chic, but Sport Cap 2.0 is just not working for me. It whistles every time I take a sip. So I went to their FAQ, and their solution is ""to loosen the cap just a tiny bit, just make sure it's still tight enough to keep the bottle from leaking"". Really? Let me tell you this, Too Much Trouble. I have to go through this process everyday, figuring out a perfect position for my cap that is loose enough for the noise but is tight enough so water does not leak. They need to come up with 3.0, and I'll give them 5 stars."
240969,1,Bought this as a gift for someone who loves outdoor adventures and they loved it...great quality and loved the case that came with it...a great and neat little device.....a great buy!!!
478542,0,"I love the concept of this system, but didn't quite get into it. I pre - ordered this when it first came out. I used it for a few weeks and stuck it in the attic for a few years. I have recently taken out to test out my new heart rate monitor and see how many calories I actually burn using this. Rock it Off was the best, burning 455 calories for me in about 40 minutes, but that is really the only workout from this series that I enjoyed. The wave could be replaced w/ a step bench for the most part."
274131,1,"Arrived on time and the usual Russel great quality-good fit, good construction and quality fabric. Russel is always a good product."
405058,0,"I am a serious magnet for mosquitos and gnats.I have used this item about 8 to 10 times over the past 2 to 3 years. I was very surprised yesterday, when it failed miserably versus all the other times. I wasn't bitten twice, or 3 times, or even four or five, but 12 TIMES!!! (right after going back inside, I took the jacket off and I took pictures to prove it)I placed the jacket on before going out the door, I was sitting outside for 15 minutes, and so I am assuming that the jacket only works if you are either aware of keeping your skin away from touching the surface of the jacket, or if you are moving or standing, and not sitting. It's just shockingly disappointing considering that I'm sure there were other times that I used it while sitting down.I now have to consider trying the new Deep Woods powder spray. (Of course I still don't like the idea of it on my skin though) I don't know if I can put trust into those electronic ""gadget"" devices."
438354,2,"These in fact are intended to be used as bag gloves. If it was only a quick ""wrap"", there wouldn't be any gel in the knuckles. Once your hand is in this glove, it cannot fit into a standard boxing glove.This glove has half fingers which have elastic at the ends. The elastic is so tight that it cuts off your circulation in each finger and is useless. Otherwise, this is a good glove and provides good wrist support, but will wear out quickly.I've used the Harbinger brand gloves for years, with absolutely no problems or injuries. Although Harbinger WristWrap Bag Gloves are twice the cost, the Harbinger are far superior.Harbinger 320 Bag Glove WristWrap (Black)Since these are one of the most important pieces of equipment that you will have, don't compromise."
348447,1,I love these ear band-its...this is my second one...great for keeping ear plugs in place and your hair out of your eyes
394345,0,"These shorts - identicle to a previous pair I own, are good quality although very thin. They are best for wearing under a wetsuit for short rides. There is not much material to absorb sweat so it runs right down you legs. They do wear even thinner after a while and the elastic getts a bit loose but all in all they are good shorts for a specific purpose."
282977,1,The mosquito net worked as needed. It didn't fit perfectly over fairly wide brimmed hat. It did keep the biters at bay.
508473,1,"I bought this black one for my exercise wear. Shown in the picture, it looks long and won't show my tummy and back. But it turned out it was little shorter than any other tanks. Perhaps, I should have ordered a larger size.After several washes, it still looks good and comfy."
128981,0,"I bought these compression tights to wear everyday during the winter in New England. The material is great; it's comfortable and keeps me warm. The only problem is the elastic at the bottom which cuts off the circulation in my feet. I've tried pulling the end over my socks or rolling them up to my ankles, but the elastic is too tight for my comfort. I'm 5'3"", 115 pounds, and I bought a small. I love Under Armour, and I recommend the fitted leggings which do not have the elastic band at the bottom end."
84483,0,I like the idea but after waiting a month to get this I was surprised at how heavy it was. I weighed it and with the sheath it is nearly 1.75 pounds which doesn't sound like a lot but in my backpack ounces count. It was easy enough to set up and take down. Now I haven't used it with a fire yet but did test the top for stability and it is not too stable on top. The 4 prongs don't lay flush so you either have to hold your cup/pot or try and bend them to make them a bit more flat they had a curve to them.I plan on taking this out within the next few weeks and will report back on how well it actually does in the field. Hope this helps. Until next time. Cheers!
139480,1,"So far so good. I'm about 6' and 175lbs, and I've never used one of these before. I got it to improve my grip as I am interested in getting into rock climbing. I bout this one along with the Medium tension Gripmaster Pro. If you have never used one of these before, and you do not lift weights and have a little bit of flexibility on price, I recommend starting with the Extra-Light tension. The Light tension is great for my thumb, index, and middle fingers, but it's edgy on the ring and too much tension for my pinky. You can get away with the light tension for all fingers if you take it slowly, but if you are looking to jump right in and do 50 reps with your smaller digits it's not going to happen if you are a beginner.The first day I used it, my finger tips were SORE and my forearm was significantly worked, however, my pinky finger joint also hurt. So, take it easy if you start out with one of these; I hear you can really do some damage by overdoing it. Otherwise, great product. Solidly built, and works great for it's purpose."
408639,2,Price was good; Shipping and packaging was excellent; DVD supplied by pro gym was complete. I had a few questions about the product and customer service was prompt and they did everything possible to help me out. It was just that our inside doors in our home were just not conductive to the product.
156044,0,I expected the blade to be a bit larger. being that small make it less useful in a way
342849,1,"Warm, good camo pattern, keeps my legs dry in the deepest of snow. I like that fact that it is an all natural material as well. The water proof space age plastic stuff is water proof and warm, but it is nice to see that you can still get back to the old fashioned natural materials and make them work just as well. The price was very reasonable too. Usually wool is very expensive."
173669,2,"Having purchased this along with a spare cylinder I was very disapointed when it arrived and the plunger was very stiff and wouldn't line up correctly. Had to take it apart and using a Dremel tool, reamed out the plunger and now it works...Just like the Traditions nipple wrench and capper, which both broke on first time use, this item is very poorly made and cheap..."
112085,1,Tiger Claw is a good belt but I received the wrong sizeI have ordered four Tiger Claws and several people in my Martial Arts Clubs have purchased them.I was a little put off because the vendor shipped a belt that did not have a size lable on it.This looked shaky to me so I measured the belt and it was size six. The cost is not enough to return it.It just looked as if someone ripped of the size label.
182597,1,My son will actually wear these and keeps them on. The blue is nice because it blocks the sun a bit when he is floating on his back.
81576,0,"I liked the idea of not wearing a strap while working out, but in reality they are better. This one works fine, no problem there. But in the middle of your cardio routine you have to stop enough to use the two fingers from your free hand to press on the watch you are wearing and it takes a few seconds (5) to give you the read out. By then your heart rate is already starting to go down. If you want real accurate measurements and you want them at a glance...the strap is the best way to go. You just have to look at the watch to know where your heart rate is."
228235,0,"These fit fine, but I am not sure why the product description says they are stone washed. The are normal denim overalls."
468930,2,I bought this for my M91/30.My biggest complaint is that requires so much grinding away of the material to make it fit properly. So much so that I began wondering if it had been intended for another rifle.I had to grind away large portions of material so the Ejector and Ejector spring would function.I also had to file down the inside cavity area where the Trigger guard & magazine fits in. It was squeezing the magazine so hard the rounds could not travel through it. This to required a significant amount of material removal.Filing had to be done in the forward areas of the receiver and portions around the barrel area for it to fit into place.If you buy one of these I would suggest you have the proper tools for grinding and filing.-ejack
11031,1,"Fleece is fleece, but this vest is surprisingly well put-together. The only thing is it missing is a third pocket (the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have)."
55638,0,"A little expensive. After I had already made the purchase, found them at local store for less."
31605,0,"No top clip on this bag - so hence it only being ok. Size is good for a cellphone, keys, and a small tube of sunscreen. The bag I was trying to replace clipped on and off for greater portability. However this bag is well constructed and easy to install"
159561,0,definitely over priced for what this vest is. There was no paperwork in the box when I received it. Decided to keep it anyways.
387496,0,"I bought these for my grandson for basketball games, but he felt they were too thick! Sorry. I gave them to my husband instead because he thought they would be great for most things in his wintry life--ice fishing, scooping snow, and just being outdoors."
435587,0,"I am a fan of Harbinger gloves. I bought these gloves because I lift 4 to 5 days a week and wanted something that provided superior wear, comfort, and functionality. The gloves are constructed well but the rubber inserts ruin the glove. They are very stiff and even after break in are still uncomfortable. I've torn almost all the rubber nubs off the fingers, the palm rubber is still in good shape. Any grip advantage you have with these gloves is negated by how uncomfortable they are. If your main reason for considering these gloves are for grip I'd suggest using straps with your existing gloves."
87970,1,arrived promptly and exactly like it was supposed to be.. my daughter likes it very much..
233720,0,"Very nice product. I was hoping they would be a little bit larger than they actually are. Good fit and very see-thru, which is very sexy."
503437,0,"I bought these. They seem VERY sturdy...however, they are VERY clunky - can't grip anything wearing these. Also, they are TOO short! Water will get up your sleeve.I really prefer the Cosa Bella gloves. They fit nicely, and pull all the way up."
259945,0,The fishing line appears to be old. The box that contains the line was unusually worn. Would not consider the line to be new.
490016,0,"Does not tast that bad actually pretty good, I recommend that you use a little hot sauce. Could not be easier to make,"
277002,1,"I bought this for photography purposes. I have an off-camera flash, and when I need that extra hand to hold my flash while I'm focusing my camera, or making adjustments, this sack comes in handy! It's long enough and the drawstring closure keeps it from falling out. The little pocket holds my extra AAA batteries. The insulation provides a nice padding also. It's light and the strap is perfect and adjustable. I was hoping for a belt loop also, but I think I can sew that on myself. This is just a suggestion for those of you who could use another photo accessory since there's no such thing out there. It works perfect!!"
118823,0,Bought these gloves as an upgrade to my bag gloves. For hitting the bag they are great but they are too dense for sparring. Sparring with these would be like hitting someone with 10oz gloves.
225299,1,"I really like this safe for keeping my children away from my firearm.Pros:1. It is not expensive.2. It is easy to use.3. Small enough to fit most anywhere (mine is screwed into the wall of my closet, and is hidden by my clothes).Cons:1. Keys don't light up at night.2. Keys are HOMAK, so having a meaningful code is not likely.3. If you have more than one handgun (with magazines), you may want a bigger size.Overall, I am well pleased with this safe."
803,0,"The bed is fairly comfortable for sleeping, but doesn't hold air from day to day or through the night. Every night I slept on it I had to inflate it."
132889,2,"this thing is a piece of junk you would not believe how many problems it has it will burn a hole in your pocket, its a money pit.AS soon as you replace something there will be another part to break,not to mention that minimoto went out of business and sold there left over parts to monster part.Anyway i would stay away from this nightmare."
23717,1,"i bought it for my 6 month old. She hates things on her head and screamed the whole ride. Fit well though, but run some test drives before you hit the road. If it's not perfect the baby CAN rip it off their head."
172619,0,"My feet sweat and I thought these would be good and keep them dry, but they don't do such a great job. I will continue to wear them, but I think I will have to buy the foot drying powder and place that in the sock each time I wear them. This next part is an update that I wrote on April 9, 2009: the socks only lasted six months due to holes forming around my big toe. I am not a fan of Adidas socks for sure, since they only lasted six months. I wore these socks once a day every two weeks and they disappointed."
3985,2,These goggles are a waste of money. They break real easy and water gets in to your eyes. DO NOT BUY THESE! I REPEAT! DO NOT BY THESE! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY! DO YOU HEAR ME!
408805,0,"Changing the battery is annoying. It requires a small screwdriver to get the plate off. Which means it's not easy to do on the field.The fan itself is pretty powerful and it plugs in very nicely to my JT goggles.I found it to bee to loud though. In Airsoft, when your trying to sneek and talk in lower tones, I can't make out what people are saying 10 feet away from me over the buzz. Even tried oiling it but it didn't help."
30365,0,"I bought this because ""the coolest feature is the headphone exit port"" -according to the manufacturer, and I wanted to use it and listen to music when jogging. Well guess what? There isn't one. Or am I missing it? Otherwise, a great little pack, just right for a day's activities."
450045,0,"My boyfriend loves this bike rack so much more than the latch on he had. His only complaint is that the bikes are really close together on the rack if you have 3 or 4.However my complaints are long...My first complaint is it is very hard to fit a girls or woman's style bike on this rack, it takes extra effort to get it on where the men's style just glides right on. My second complaint is with a 4 bike load it makes it top heavy and the whole thing hits on the street. We drove from Colorado to Oregon with 2 bikes on it and it was still heavy enough to hit in driveways and such unless you drive though them at an angle, which is sometimes impossible to do. I do love that it attaches to the hitch and it swings out so you can still open the back of the car. But even that is a pain, because the heaviness of the bikes you can't unscrew the knob to let it swing out. You literally have to push the bikes back and hold them to take the weight off so you can unscrew it to swing out. I can't do that on my own, which is very inconvenient."

211476,0,"Zumba is the latest rage, and I can appreciate Beto's enthusiasm. However, I was very disappointed with the DVD. It was too basic so I'm donating it to the local Senior Center."
200789,2,"I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews. At first I was happy, they fit perfect, then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life. My medium shirts became XXS. I wish I had a 8 year old son, because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now."
232203,0,"I bought these tights to wear to yoga class, which is an air conditioned space.They are easy to put on, long enough for my 5' 6' body, did not lose color on washing ( 2 times so far),and opaque enough to hide underpants. I liked the higher rise ( vs the new lower rise style). I did want a slightly tighter ( maybe more spandax) and also heavier tights and that is why I gave them 3 stars. However these are fine and if they continue to hold up I will wear them during the colder weather with skirts."
102950,2,I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product. I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg. Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs. What happened to elastic ribbing? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated. I tossed these sweats. I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s! What happened?
27337,1,As i was leaving feedback i accidently pressed the no answer instead of the yes answer. i just wanted to correct that and say that the sneakers were brand new and shipped on time
109122,2,The Stearns SunShower 5 gallons I received is not like in the picture and description information of the advertisement. I purchased two and both are like the the 4 gallon or smaller style without the 1 inch carrying strap that can be put into the tube and hung up. The ability to hang the sunshower is impossible and carrying with the water weight starts tearing the plasic around the holding spot of the the SunShower on top. A totally different style shipped than I expected like from the picture. Doesn't work well like the ones in the picture I had used before.
84376,1,Simple Explanation>>>no show---no matter what!>>they are extreme elastic and won't ride up or down>i've washed my socks over twenty times and no fade.Strongly recommended.
192269,1,"This stuff is awesome!! been using it for 2yrs. got a hole ""wallard"" out the size of a full size pick-up truck."
396345,1,I bought this when these bags were on sale. A good spacious bag to carry your stuff for a weekend away as a carry-on in flights without having to deal with checkin hassles. It is spacious and comfortable. I wish the material was a bit more sturdy but it is a good value for the price.
502305,0,This thing served the purpose as a fold up bed but it was hard as a rock.I saw where many people called it very firm but I beg to differ.This thing is hard but not quite as hard as the floor...that is why I gave it three stars.
254095,1,"Having had spinal fusion a few years ago it has been very difficult finding ab exercises that I am able to do without hurting myself. When trying to do a traditional crunch, I'm basically like an overturned turtle flailing about. That part of my spine just doesn't bend anymore. The Ab Lounge allows me to use my hips rather than my sine to bend and I still really feel my abs working. I'm able to fully extend my back and get back up. This actually relieves my back pain. Using the handle bars is pretty awkward for me though. That could either be due to my spine or my short stature of 5'2. The overhead straps work very nicely though. It folds up failrly easily and can be stored against a wall or under a bed. I will say you should make sure you have about 6 feet of space to use it properly. Maybe a little more if you have to extend the foot rest."
448045,0,"It arrived fast and it's really nice to look at. The problem I found is that when you use it in the stands that have backs on them already it seems to push you forward. Also the tubing that frames its is felt through the cushioning and is not comfortable. I ended up folding it down and sitting on top of it, which was fine. It really is good looking though."
3411,2,"I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars. I had All Stars that lasted well over five years. Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time. The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before. Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today. One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole: the pinstripe on the sole of high quality shoes is thick and solid. While the pinstripe on the Converses of today are thin and weak (and they rip and tear off from my experiences; something that NEVER happened with the quality of before) That's just one indicator. There are many subtle differences that combined make a huge difference in overall quality and durability. The quality went down since Nike bought Converse some time ago (and yet the prices went up). But the style is classic and if you like to wear new-looking Converse, then the Converse of today will do for you. But if you're like me and prefer sporting your kicks dirty and beat-up and for an extended period of time, I suggest you go on Ebay and buy a pair of Converse kicks from before. But you're going to have to bid high because after all, you'll be bidding on high quality and awesome durability, which is something the Converses of today do not have."
378828,0,"I have these installed on a couple of bikes. They work fine on modern bikes with vertical dropouts, as long as you don't over-tighten them. If that were the end of the story, I would give them 5 stars for the price. But there are 2 major problems with how these skewers are advertised:1) These skewers are NOT suitable for the rear wheel of older bikes, fixed gear bikes, or track bikes. All of these types of bikes have horizontal or semi-horizontal dropouts on the rear. If you tighten the axles to specification, they will NOT have enough force to hold the rear wheel in place under hard pedaling or hard braking. If you tighten the skewer beyond specifications, the skewer will break in your hands.2) These are advertised as preventing wheel theft. While they are *slightly* harder to remove than a quick release skewer, a single bike multi-tool can remove the wheel. In other words, a single hex key (allen wrench) is enough to remove the skewer. That isn't much security.Those are my objections to this product. If they warned you of the incompatibility with the bike types I've listed above, I would make this 4 stars. If they played down the 'security' aspect of the product (which is laughable), I would award it 5 stars. Truth in advertising is what this product lacks. This information is not contained on the packaging nor on any of the websites that sell it."

502240,0,"Worked well for the first 2 months, but then the bungee ties for the net started to break from sun rot. I live in North Dakota, so the sun really isn't that strong. The net was placed in an area that is shady half the day. Now I need to purchase a replacement net and straps. Bummer."

169816,1,"My husband wears a size 11 thin (3mm) snorkel bootie, and the largest size of these fins just fit over them. I'm a big believer in wearing booties under fins, not only for comfort, but to protect your feet in case you want to snorkel at a beach with a rocky entrance.These fins did not fit over my teen son's size 12 booties."
287126,1,"Well made product that keeps you warm through those very cold soccer practices and games. They wick the sweat away, keep you warm and stretch in all directions. I have three soccer players and they all love to wear them."
495511,1,This is a very nice item! I ordered it to go with all my other Bass stuff I have hanging on my walls. I really like it but only gave it 4 stars because the hook on one of the lures is caught upward and not hanging like treble hooks should be. I cannot get it to shake loose which leads me to believe seller sent it like that. The only way to fix it is to take it apart. It is also a bit pricy but like I said it is very nice. Too bad they weren't real lures!
481908,2,I bought one of these knifes at the local sporting goods store so I thought I would purchase three more for gifts. The price was right and the picture is the same but when I recieved them they had 3 holes drilled on the back of the knife. They must be seconds.
474997,1,A great product for your pedometer. It provides a strong metal connection whereas the original equipment on most pedometers is plastic. I recommend it strongly.
268096,2,"For my team we all ordered these socks. I found the only good thing about them is that they have an Under Armour logo. wearing them is a totally different story. They are uncomfortable and thin. They cause feet to sweat even before any physical activity. In a 30F game my feet still sweat. After you sweat in them they will just get slippery and cause one to slide in the cleat, loosing speed and agility."
211548,1,"I bought two pairs - black and charcoal. I like the black ones the best. Here's my laundry list:Pros:-Soft-Long (up to about my calves)-Stretchy-Stay up throughout the day-Breathable-AbsorbentCons:-Not THAT warm in the winter-This is just a con in general about wool socks. Since they're more expensive, I take better care of them than my other clothes, and so I wash these by hand. Since they soak up so much water, it generally takes a while to clean these. Once cleaned, they take anywhere between 1.5-2 days to try at room temperature.I would recommend these to anyone. I'm never going back to cotton socks!"
75834,1,"It is what it looks like. Easy to carry, on the ground chair. Perfect for hunting, but would like camp colors."
294733,1,"This is a near perfect camping/backpacking product. It is light, fairly small, durable, easily packed into it's own ""stuff sack"", and, most importantly, very comfortable. I could use this daily in my bedroom with no complaints. I have a size medium which is great. Because I love it so much, I might pick up a size small at some point to save a little room in my pack.I'm so glad I didn't spend more on one of those inflatable pillows. While they might pack up nice and small, I can't imagine them to be even half as comfortable as this. This modest little item is one of my favorite pieces of gear. Bonus: it's made in the USA.P.S. It seems some of the 1 star reviews complain that this pillow is ""flat and lumpy."" I can only assume that they took it out of the package, unrolled it, and didn't bother to fluff it and give it a few moments to expand. It is designed to COMPRESS! That's the whole point. The foam compresses to a very small size when rolled, but will gradually expand to fluff up to a VERY comfortable pillow full of cushion and loft. Yes, when immediately unrolled, it is flat and lumpy. Just fluff it a bit and give it a moment to decompress rather than not reading/understanding the instructions and dismissing the product."
431362,0,Not easy to use. It gets locked in the wrong menu and has to auto shutoff before working properly. Cadence receiver moves about. The rubber bands are not enough to hold it in place.
424759,2,"I read multiple reviews before deciding on the GustBuster Golf Umbrella plus I'd bought a smaller GustBuster umbrella that I was very happy with and worked perfectly. I received the golf umbrella and used it once (and NOT on a windy day). The 2nd time I tried to use it the umbrella catch wouldn't latch so the umbrella wouldn't stay open unless I pushed up and held the slider at the top, otherwise it would collapse (not exactly ideal while trying to walk a dog). I figured this was a fluke, sometimes products have a defect, so I sent it back and ordered another one. I opened it up and the SAME PROBLEM occurred - it wouldn't stay open. I'm simply flabbergasted at the lack of quality control and wonder if anyone else has had the same experience with this brand. I was really looking forward to using this during our windy rainy days here in Okinawa Japan but alas I am off in search of another brand to keep me dry..."
354740,1,"first of all, any bad reviews on these shoes are by people who dont understand these are tailor made for chinese gung fu, not japanese karate. in wing chun, your feet are ""rooted"" to the ground-thats what the groovey tracton is for.those people complain that the traction makes it hard to pivot on the heel. well, thats why real karatekas are barefoot! second, these shoes are like WALKING ON AIR. try on a new pair, and you will instantly know what i mean. 3rd-know your size. im a size 12, and i got the size 47 feiyue, which is actually a half too big in the toe area, but really, it just adds to the comfort, in my opinon. once laced, theyre PERFECT. there is talk that theyre made alittle small, so i went up abit. 47=about 12 1/2 - 13. if that helps. these shoes WILL make you WANT to practice, especially kicks, they feel that good! they are thin, so you wont want to walk across town over heavy gravel. the addition of insole supports would probably remedy that quick, though. they got a strong rubber oder when new, but i tell you, theyre so freakin comfy, you wont care, youll be too busy practicing your gung fu or just enjoying your feet. BOTTOM LINE: FEIYUE ARE THE BEST SHOES FOR GUNG FU!"
383933,0,"After finally tracking down the customer service number for parts for this product, I was advised that the auto & electric division handles parts for this unit. Since the merger, they cannot replace anything except for the remaining parts they have in stock since it is now a discontiued item. I tried to order the CFL bulb which is $10.00 plus about another $10.00 in shipping. I was told by a nice man that I might want to go to a battery specialty store and see if my battery is really pulling the charge to drive the 9-watt CFL bulb. If it is even a hint from being fully charged, the bulb will not work. He said that these batteries usually fail and will not keep a full charge after a few years of ownership. So, to pay $20.00 for a recharged/refurbished battery and another $20.00 for the bulb if the battery wasn't the problem would void the value of the product. I've found that everything I have bought at Sams Club is usually a toss-away item after a brief period of time. Keep in mind, this unit was only $39.99 Most everything at Sams or Wallmart is made in China so what do you expect? Like the others have said - SHAME ON SAMS CLUB. Next time, shame on me for shopping there."
336313,1,"This is a big game board. For some reasons I just assumed this was small, so I was shocked how big this thing was when receiving it:O So check the measurement! My family is having a lot of fun with this board. It is a good quality product for what it is. We are so used to video games or apps nowadays, so we find it exciting to compete in real life games against each other. My kids are 1st graders. I recommend this to anyone who want to relax at home and have some fun."
475365,0,"This is a nice watch and fits great. I like the style and colors. the only problem is in the wrist band. there is a small button on the end of the band that fits into a small hole to hold the wrist band together. It is easy to clip on, but getting off with one had is very difficult. I have to pull very hard and nearly bruise my arm to release the button. I have to cut off the button so I don't go crazy each time I wear it."

362105,1,"My switch feels ""mushy"". the detents are nor as hard as I'd expected and it is very easy to have the switch slightly off the ""fully engaged"" position. My switch is also slightly mis-aligned, the marker notch on the blue handle doesn't quite line up with the colored markers on the background.Movement is smooth and it is simple to see the switch setting from a distance.The terminals on the back are mostly simply labeled as ""battery 1"" and ""battery 2"" but the ""feed' lug should be called ""output"" IMO. lugs are very large, both in diameter and length and include split lock washers."
50867,2,"This may be a great soccer ball, but the colors shown are dark blue, green, and red. We received the ball today, and it is white and pink! The ball is for a boy, and somehow I have a feeling he will not like a pink one. I know I could return the ball, but I ordered a different one from a different vendor.If there are other colors of the ball, and there is no choice as to what one receives, please show ALL the colors. If I had known there was a possibility of getting a pink one, I would NEVER have ordered this ball."

396405,0,This thing has play and not the 1/4 inch it's a bit play but movement in the 3-4 inch section as I load up my bicycles. I have quite a bit of money invested in my bikes and having the thing crash once when I loaded my less expensive bike on the lower section of the stand nearly sent me to hospital with fright. Ok so I have to crank the foot screws tighter... As I took to the screws on the floor with a crescent wrench and a pipe to extend the lever arm I was amazed at how close to crushing the drywall I came. I've put both bikes up and wiggled the center section in and out with that 3-4 inch play I have discussed. I'm sure loading and unloading the bikes during riding season will wiggle the stand despite my Herculean attempts.With everything bolted down to the point where anything more will strip the screws now all that is left is the passage of time...
357606,1,"I've used these dri power shirts for the past 2 years. I play basketball and go the gym almost every day and these are the shirts that I wear most often. I own about 5 different ones.

But under armour is about 3x the price.You can't go wrong with this product."

117282,0,I really do like this however my biggest issues is that it's tough to get on and off my bike. I'm physically fit and have thought that someone overweight would have major issues. It's just that when I'm riding along with the 3 y/o along side us (me and the 18 month old in the ibert) we have to stop at every intersection and getting on and off is a pain! Once I'm on it's great! So that's my only thought....
201355,1,"This bike is for my two 65 year old parents. I researched different bikes for almost a month. My mom is an italian round woman, knee problems, belly, --round but cute. My dad is 5' 10"". I needed a bike that was sturdy, easy to put together, (takes about 45 min), and in which the seat would be cushioned enough for my mom to renew her dedication into getting in better shape. She used to walk on the treadmill but because of her foot problems, walking has become hard for her. It was important to make the right decision. My parents are not into frills and the computer gives the basic that is needed Calories, Pace, Distance, Speed. I sat on the bike and was impressed by its wide extremely cushioned seat with a lumbar supported back, and just the overall position and sturdiness of this bike. It resembles a commercial grade that I secretly paid a fair price for. Delivery wAs made through Fedex. Fedex came through late x- mas eve, actually after 10pm, and that alone made me really happy. Amazon rocks, Fedex was amazing and my parents will be on a road to good health. Now stop, reading, researching because if 500 is what your looking to spend, and mine was 450 (50 for shipping because i ordered it for christmas eve) you will not be sorry. If money is no object then I can't tell you which to buy..."
285758,2,"I bought this scope thinking it would be a good value, and because the reviews were overall positive. I purchased it back in March, mounted it on my Ruger Super Blackhawk 44 mag, zeroed it in at the range, and was very happy with my purchase... Until about a month later, when I was plinking out at my farm and noticed that with the gun resting on my shooting bench, I was unable to have the scope remain zeroed. I got through about 20 rounds of factory ammo that day, when I noticed that the recoil of the gun had caused the glass in the optic to shatter. Now I am stuck sending a piece of junk scope back to Simmons, paying shipping and return shipping, so they can repair or replace it with the same piece of junk scope. I called and spoke with their customer service department (they're owned by Bushnell), and a refund is not an option. Their customer service rep was very short and unfriendly. Reading Amazon's return policy, I refuse to take a pittance of a refund, and will just be stuck putting this scope on a future gun purchase that shoots lighter loads. Do yourself a favor and spring for a more expensive, better quality scope if you intend to use this for a magnum handgun. I would rate this zero stars if I could, since it is not able to hold up to its intended purpose of use - magnum handgun hunting."
5478,1,"Decent stick, I got the 20 oz metallic silver one, which is actually more of a gray or charcoal in my opinion, but no big deal. My issues were the same with the stickers as other reviews above and I kind of wish I could get rid of the big ""GRAPHITE"" graphic that's on it, and the packaging (I bought this item at the same time as a case for the cue) was in a box about 4x larger than it needed to be that arrived from UPS open. I left packaging feedback recommending next time using a shipping tube to send it. When I took out the cue though and removed all the wrapping, the cue was fine even though it practically fell out of the box. I have played about 40-50 games with it now, and I do like the feel of it, including balance, weight, solidness, and the way it glides through my bridge hand (I think that's the graphite talking - probably won't ever need hand chalk), and it's straight as an arrow too. It does have a funny taper to it just after the joint on the tip end, and I did think the grip would be a little different, like maybe rubberized or something (seems more like paper wrapped around it instead), but it's fine overall. If you're a pro looking for perfection, be prepared to spend $200 minimum, and up to $500 or even more, but this cue will be just fine for anyone on the amateur to lower-mid level. I mostly just play in bars and small time tournaments, and it definitely beats any bar's house cue I've ever used."

199782,2,"I'm the first to admit that I didn't read the description carefully. But these aren't earplugs. They're hunks of silicone that you can shove into your ear. You mold them to fit, you take them out and press them into a flatter shape so they fit into the plastic box.Get earplugs instead."
290303,1,"I got this jacket just in time for our trip to Ireland and Scotland. It was invaluable to me while we were there, since we encountered rain at some point nearly every day. I kept it rolled up in the bottom of my purse and pulled it out as needed, and it kept me nicely dry and also provided good protection from the wind. I like that it has a longer length than many rain jackets, and the color I got (turtle dove) is a nice neutral off-white color that goes with everything."
472348,1,"First off, the coin-edge bezel is absolutely beautiful (the main selling point for me). Second, the watch has a real quality feel to it...from the screw down crown to the rotating bezel to the clasp. I'll admit that I had never seen this watch in person and went solely off every picture and review I could find on the interwebs. The size of the case is not as big as I thought it would be, but I think this is attributed to the size of the black bezel (makes the face look a little smaller than I had anticipated)...plus there was a user picture previously uploaded of the watch on his arm and it look much bigger but I believe it was a different model becuase the picture has been removed.This is my first automatic watch and it really is neat to watch the movement. The time has been spot on...haven't tracked it enough to know if it gets a couple seconds slower/faster each day.This watch will be my daily watch for a long time. Very happy with my first Invicta watch purchase."

60993,0,"I purchased this headband for use in my kickboxing class in which the instructor likes to keep the heat on between 80 to 85 degrees so I'm constantly wiping sweat out of my face. I use an Under Armour heat-gear compression shirt and that works wonders in wicking away sweat from my body. However, this sweat band doesn't really do too great of a job probably because it's a pretty thin strip of material although I do wipe my face maybe 40% less than I do without it. I also purchased the regular Under Armour cotton headband and it honestly does a much better job at half the price so I'd recommend that or any other cotton headband over this one."

251145,2,"Maybe it arrogance or just being lazy, I keep hopping that each time I use this thing it will live up to it reputation and not spill a drop. However, it never does. Leaks at every point that there is a crack, not a lot but a definite puddle of fuel. Then when you remove it (from the lantern or stove), splash more fuel comes out. Never liked it after the first use, but its become a staple joke at our camp as for how much fuel it spills. We almost take bets on how much."
209342,0,"Then I wouldn't have been so confused that there was no fleece blanket!! Anyway, is okay for the price, would have liked the removable fleece and for it to be a bit softer but I haven't washed it yet, so maybe that will make the difference."

After numerous wash cycles over the course of a couple months, these shorts are beginning to show some significant wear (fraying at the elastic ends). I'm guessing this is expected with the frequency of use. However, I would have hoped they could take the beating a bit better. They still work fine though and I expect them to last at least through the year."
19667,2,"What a great concept, a dress Casio G Shock atomic watch that will actually fit under your your long shirt sleeves, with virtually perfect atomic time-keeping via radio station WWV in Ft.Collins, Colorado. I thought that this watch would address all my needs, so I purchased it directly at full price ($130.00) from the Casio website. That is where the disappointment began. Buttons to set this watch are impossible to use and no matter how much pressure I would use, nothing happened. So I phoned the Casio website for technical information and they recommended that I use a small screwdriver to calibrate the watch and even that was unsuccessful. What to do? I returned the watch to the Casio online store and they promptly issued a full refund including shipping, but I was still without a watch. My solution was to purchase a Casio Atomic G-Shock directly from a local department store, so I again contacted Casio for support on where to visit. They suggested Macy's and Sears. Our local Macy's no longer caries Casio watches but I was successful at Sears and I found the perfect Casio Atomic G Shock watch for my needs:G-Shock Men's Multi-Band Atomic watch #GW5600J1It keeps perfect time and I point it in a westward direction towards Ft. Collins, CO on my window sill every night and ""exactly"" at 1:00am it re-calibrates itself to perfection. Although, it does not fit under my long shirt sleeves, I will adjust and buy larger sleeves!"

417938,0,"DO NOT buy Slendertone products from SlendertoneUSA and/or Slendertone.com! First of all, their prices are up to $50 higher per item that what is offered on Amazon and other retailers.

Finally, their customer service is the absolute worst I have ever experienced.SlendertoneUSA is not the manufacturer of Slendertone products. The products are manufactured in Ireland and they work well. SlendertoneUSA is just one of the US distributors of Slendertone products. I learned this the hard way. I ordered the Flex belt via Slendertone.com, then saw it offered on Amazon.com for half the price. When I called Slendertone customer service to cancel the order, they wouldn't take no for an answer, told me they'd match Amazon's price and upgraded my product from the Flex to the System Abs (a better product). Two weeks later, I received the wrong product (the Flex)and my credit card was charged at the inflated Slendertone.com price.I have contacted their customer service four times now and two months later, have yet to receive the System Abs (the product they promised). It took three calls to find a supervisor (who was rude and unhelpful)and when I took the trouble to write an email of complaint, I got a generic, automatic response.Slendertone USA has the worst customer service department I have ever encountered.

278455,1,"My experience with the Kid Alert has been positive, but short! I had it up in my front yard for 1 day, and was feeling very good about the purchase, because all of my neighbors commented on it. Some thought it was a good idea, others playfully mocked me... EITHER WAY IT WAS SEEN which, to me, means it was doing it's job.Like I said previously, my experience with the Kid Alert was brief. I left it out overnight and the next morning it had mysteriously vanished... HMMM... I like it enough that I bought a new one, however if you purchase this item, I would strongly recommend either bringing it in whenever you bring your kids in (for me that concept is much too cumbersome) or filling it with some cement (the whole toy, not just the base), this however means that you're going to have to cut a hole in it somewhere and figure out how to patch it back up. If you do go with the cement option, get the fast setting concrete powder. That way all you'll need to do is put the cement powder into the toy and add the recommended amount of water, no mixing required.I haven't done it yet, but I figure two 50lb bags should do the trick (the bags are much smaller than you might otherwise think)!"

88914,0,I bought these for a two week trip to Europe. They saved a ton of space over traditional cotton tees. They were easy to wash in a sink and came relatively clean (nothing like machine washing though). The downsides are: (1) they trap body heat initially and it was very warm when you first put them on. (2) The collar wrinkles and looks bad.

I used it to carry my wife's heavy cruiser bike and worked well. The hook end goes to the seat post and the locking end goes to the neck or stem portion of the handlebar. Because the cruiser's stem angles towards the front of the handlebars, I was concerned that due to the weight of the bike, it may slide down and extend the tension bar further up the stem. But, that didn't happen. The spring's tension was enough to keep the tension bar in place. Although the bar is coated with plastic/rubber material, the locking part does not have it. And so I had to put a homemade plastic tube between the lock and the neck or stem to avoid any scratches. For easy installation, install the lock portion first, then pull the other side to hook it in the seat post. For easy removal, reverse the direction. Hope this helps."
280209,0,"I upgraded my good'ol leather jump rope to this one. I really like it. Ball bearing makes it goes very smooth and fast, and I can do way better than I could with my old one.But after 2 weeks, it snapped. I used it three times a week for 15-20 minutes each time, and it snapped from the middle of the rope.Yes, I used it on concrete ground on my drive way, but after TWO WEEKS???If I have an indoor space to work out, I would have done so, but I don't think many people get to be that lucky. If I have a gym to go to, I wouldn't need the jump rope to warm up.I liked the product, but I would suggest to use it only on flooring."

449369,1,"Never waste your time with a plastic handled gripper! They are limiting and only develop strength to a point--and you have no real way to measure how strong your grip actually is. With Iron Mind Grippers you can have structure in your training that does not exist with any other gripper. Because you know the exect poundage you are gripping, you know how to track your progress if you set specific physical goals. If someone asks you what you can bench, you probaby know even if you havn't benched in a while. Now when anyone asks you what gripper you can close or what the exact force of your grip is, you are able to tell them. Grip strength is measureable for the first time because of Iron Mind Grippers. So now you can train your grip with purpose and with specific goals, yielding measurable results."

350035,1,"I first saw the Mobiky featured on ""I Want That"", a TV show about new products on the HGTV cable network. I was impressed by the Mobiky's easy, quick folding and the ability to roll on its own wheels when folded.Thanks to Abikestore.com, a week after the show I had my new, cobalt blue Mobiky.FIRST IMPRESSIONThe Mobiky's construction speaks ""high quality"". The aluminum finish, the paint quality, and weld joints are all exceptional.Due to weather, the Mobiky stood in my living room for a couple of evenings before my first ride. Many times, I'd catch myself looking at it, as if admiring a piece of industrial art. If the Aeron office chair can be on display at the Museum of Modern Art in NY, so can the Mobiky. I regretted riding my Mobiky, because it will get dirty.PRE-RIDEMy Mobiky needed a little adjustment, before I could ride it. The manual warns riders to make sure the ""stay tube"" locks in place. Mine did not. After using a screwdriver and hammer to reseat the plug the ""stay tube"" rests on, my Mobiky was ready to go.Adjusting the proper height of the handlebars and seat will take some experimenting. You'll also have to play with the tension of the adjusting clamps or your seat will slowly sink as you ride. If you collapse the Mobiky for maximum smallness, your height adjustments are lost. I wish the tubes were scored with measurements, so settings could be remembered. I will mark the tubes with a felt pen.The front and rear brakes were in perfect, factory adjustment.RIDINGThe Mobiky will not compete in the next Tour de France. Someone on a conventional 10-speed breezed right past me. The Mobiky has 3 speeds so that's an unfair comparison. But the Mobiky is a lot faster than walking.The factory literature touts the Mobiky as a tool for bridging short range commuting. To that design goal, the Mobiky is on target.I did notice an alignment issue with the front and rear tires. My Mobiky wants to veer right ever so slightly; maybe one degree. I feel this excusable when you realize there are 9 connection and weld points from axle to axle. With that many connections, it's amazing the alignment is as good as it is. Remember this is a folding bike. To compensate, you can offset the handlebar down tube with the front wheel so the bike goes straight when the handlebar is held straight. I believe I can correct this misalignment, as I get familiar with the mechanics of my Mobiky. If you're not as handy, bring the Mobiky to a professional bicycle mechanic for a final tweak.As promised, the Mobiky pedals like a big bike. The ingenious, dual chains are silent and smooth. The 3 speed shifter a bit stiff, but I expect that to wear in over time.STAR APPEALThe Mobiky will draw stares. As I pedaled past a gas station, 60 feet away, a dude and his chick were gassing up their Harley. These hardcore bikers were dressed head to toe in black riding leathers and skull caps. Without a word to each other, they turned and stared as I pedaled by.At the first store, I folded the Mobiky in 2 seconds, opened the door, and parked the Mobiky inside with easy approval from an employee.At my next stop, I got bolder and didn't ask for permission to bring the Mobiky in. I folded the Mobiky in 2 seconds, opened the door, and parked the Mobiky at my lunch table. The employee making my sandwich wanted to know more about this unique looking bike.At my third stop, I folded the Mobiky in 2 seconds and rolled the bike around the store drawing stares and comments from store customers and employees. In the folded position, I found the seat to be a comfortable armrest, too.At my fourth stop, I folded the Mobiky in 2 seconds and paraded up and down the narrow aisles of a neighborhood market. The aisles were so crowded, I had to fold one pedal and the handlebar. I noticed people stop their shopping to get a look at the Mobiky. An employee nodded in approval. A four year old kid twisted his head backwards as his mom towed him away.When folded, the Mobiky has an incredible turning radius, which makes easy maneuvering in very small spaces. Unlike most other folding bikes, the Mobiky's ability to roll while folded cannot be oversold.When folded the built-in, padded, carry handle is well placed. Although the Mobiky is a bit aft heavy, it certainly balances well enough to easily lift over stairs.The kickstand works well.Why can the Mobiky go places no ""ordinary"" bike would be tolerated? Star appeal. I believe people are spellbound by its beauty, unique folding, and small footprint, so, like a movie star in a public place, it gets the ""star treatment"".LESS EXPENSIVE THAN YOU THINKAt first blush, the Mobiky seems expensive. But you don't need a $150+ bike rack to transport it. And, how much is it worth to not damage the finish of your car with a bike rack? What about not having to install, remove, and store a bike rack? Does the inconvenience of installing a bike rack keep you from using your bicycle more often?Also, consider not having to buy a $50+ bicycle lock. Never worry about your bike being stolen because you take the Mobiky indoors with you. How stupid is it to buy a lightweight bike only to add the weight of a lock and chain? Also, you don't have to waste time looking for a safe place to chain up your bike, too.The true value/cost of something is proportional to how much you use it. I plan to use my Mobiky to shave time off my 40 minute, 3 mile, daily walk to work. I also plan to keep my Mobiky in the car, so I never need to stress over convenient automobile parking. I can park blocks away and simply Mobiky in. Also, the US distributor tells me a hardshell luggage carrier is planned, so you can take your Mobiky on commercial airplanes. However, you will have to pay an oversize charge, as the Mobiky misses the airline luggage maximum size by 5 inches. Maybe they won't notice.In other words, what`s a better value; a seldom used $400 bike (plus bike rack + lock/chain) or a bike that costs more but is used more often?SUMMARYThe Mobiky is of French design and construction. It is the pinnacle of folding bicycle engineering. Because of it's convenience and cool factor, you'll be riding this bicycle more often. That's good for your heart and the environment. Vive la France!Douglas ChewOakland, CA""Please don't bike-jack me."""
24573,1,"I bought this ball mainly to use while sitting at a table while working. It's an appropriate height to substitute as a chair, and it is indeed 65 cm in diameter, as advertised. It did have a very rubbery odor for about 4 days, but now it's fine, and I'm pleased that I haven't had to re-inflate yet after about 3 weeks of use."
317966,1,"I ordered this last minute before a ski trip to ensure we would have enough space for luggage inside and not have to worry about skis and snowboards. I have a 2001 Suburban, with factory racks on top. This came under my Prime account, in two days, and I spent about 1 minutes reading directions and 8 installing it.The racks worked great on our drive from Denver up into the mountains to Winter Park, and were easy to get the snowboards and skis on and off. The locks were flawless, and we had no issues.Installation is easy, essentially screwing 4 bolts for each rack together to clamp onto the factory racks. There is a special hex key with an insert in the middle, so a standard allen wrench won't work. I plan on cutting the l-wrench and making a drill-insertable key so I can remove these easily (for gas mileage) when I'm not using them.One quick note, I saw a number of people with Thule bars (or other bars) with these same racks. The clamps make them stand out as they aren't as cleanly finished as some Thule products I've seen in the past. I doubt anyone notices other than someone that has had Thule racks or looks for this, but be aware the bolts are a little long and they stand out. I'll put a more detailed picture up soon with a link on my own site to explain.I was thinking we might be able to get 3 snowboards and 2 pairs of skis on one rack, and I might have been able to force the ski brakes down to place a board on top of upside down skis, but I decided not to try it. We could fit one board in the back of the truck on luggage, so we did that.The way this works is that you place 4 boards in 2 pairs, one up, one down. I have fold down bindings and this works fine, but both boys have the boot wrap bindings, which don't fold low enough, so on the Suburban I had to make sure those boards were bindings up. Adult ski bindings did fine, with plenty of clearance.I almost bought 2 racks, and glad I didn't as the factory racks are not wide enough. If you want two racks, you'd need some long, aftermarket bars that extended over the sides of the truck."

Can anyone please explain why my player would do a fadeaway jumper on a fast break? Over and over?? I understand that jump shooting and defense are necessary parts of the experience, but DANG!

They sure are fun while they last, but just not made like they used to be. We'd also bought the red/blue/yellow one for my son, and it got about the same amount of play time before it cracked and fell apart.

As a light weave that is to be expected, but when this takes ""light"" to a new meaning...So far it has survived a couple washings (and a little abuse, so it isn't completely fragile) and it makes a nice break when my main gi is a little too ""fragrant"" to wear between laundry days, but I wouldn't recommend this one as a replacement for a heavier weave top!"

99558,0,"After messing around with Off-Road bikes and Hybrids for my 10 mile-a-day commute to work, I finally decided on this bike after some research and intense review searching. Much like most owners have already posted, this is a great mass produced bike for the money, although there are a few components that need to be adressed right out of the box, before you even assemble it.Get yourself a set of new brakepads for the front and rear. The ones included do not have much grip and stopping can be a little slower than you might be comfortable with. Also, the hardware that holds the brakepads in place is flimsy and after two rides, my front brakepads had unscrewed themselves and became lost.Replace the tire tubes before you even assemble the bike (700x28), otherwise you will most likely dealing with valve stem problems and flats that are very easy to get (if you are new to road bikes, this is common. If you can find those solid foam tire tubes that require no air, those would be ideal, since the bike itself is still pretty light weight.Again, if you are new to road bikes in general, you might want to get yourself a new saddle. Specifically, one that can at least pivot forward since the included saddle only has one position, which can be uncomfortable for some.Not too much of a big deal, but I also replaced the griptape around the handlebars in exchange for something with a little more cushion.Assembly is quite an easy task for anyone, only needing a few different size allen wrenches and standard wrenches. More tools may be required if you want to tweak and tighten up a few other components, such as the cables, shifters, and gear mechanism (as the #3 gear on the left handlebar tends to slip off the chain and doesn't effectively do much).I know that this all may sound not worth it, but once you work out all the little (inexpensive) kinks, this is a wonderful bike that will provide a lot of riding miles on it. Plus, for the price, it really is a good move. Great entry level bike for commuting or recreational riding! Also, I'm 5'10"", and the large frame is ALMOST a little too large, so if you are any shorter than that, maybe see what a medium size frame does for you. I will be purchasing another bike for my girlfriend and since I don't believe in spending over $700 for a bicycle, I will probably buy another one if it needs replacing."
93706,0,"Not to bad considering the cost. It's a little on the small side (I'm 6'1"") and I barely fit. It does the trick though. If you're a wide person, you might want to look else where as the back board is very narrow. It does support my 215lb frame though. I'll give it 3.5 stars."

417272,0,"We bought this for our daughter (2 1/2) from Santa. Hubby put it together the night before, took about 15-20 minutes. The bad thing is that you can't switch from one position to another without needing a screwdriver and taking out screws and moving them to another place. So it's either a trike or a rocking toy. Also, take note it is plastic - including the wheels. This means there's no traction for riding around the house. On both wood floors and carpet, our daughter is spinning wheels a lot of the time. And when I push her around, the wheels just slide across the floor instead of turning. We bought this for seriously DIRT cheap, as in under twenty dollars, so I can't really complain. I think it will be better outside on the pavement once the weather is nice again. The peddles are a bit far from the seat too, so if your little one is short, that might be an issue. Our daughter is average and has to sit on the edge of the seat to reach the peddles. Just a few facts for anyone considering this. I would reccommend a higher quality honestly, unless you can get it cheap like we did. Metal and real tires are going to last a lot longer and be less frustrating to the little one. Good luck!"

51326,0,"I love steel targets, but i consistently end up using them in an unsafe manner. The sharp ""tang"" of a round hitting the steel provides a resounding satisfaction within me. However, after 2-5 rounds hitting the steel, the target beings to learn backwards and this in turn changes the angle the bullet strikes the steel. Still, worse than that, the leaning angle inhibits the target from spinning freely quite quickly. This style of target is intended to allow the bullet to pass thought the target, hence the spinning design. If the target does not spin, it ricochets the round else wear. The lack of a third or fourth leg behind the target to prevent the target changing its angle, is its downfall.I now hang this target upside down from a clothes line in-front of embankment. The angle of impact is constantly still shifting as the target bounces on the clothes line. However the spinning action still works this way.The package says not to use 22LR, as that round does not have the necessary energy to spin the target. I read the directions and proceeded to shoot the target with 22LR. After about six shots from my S&W; M&P15-22; 22lr riffle if had a round smack me in the forehead, right above my shooting glasses. This was from about 30+ yards. Please take my experience into account before you decide to shoot this target with rounds that do not have sufficient energy behind them to spin this target.In summation, this is very quality feeling target that is extremely satisfying to use. However the product is dangerous if not used in the proper manner."

8329,0,"Given the very favorable reviews, I had no doubt that I should go with these mirrors. I bought my first one about a month ago. I assembled it, which was pretty straight forward, except that the screws were very tight. It seems like the screw threads are not compatible with the nut threads. I had to use some machine oil to be able to tighten them. Upon assembling it, the mirror worked fine. That is, until the plastic parts broke at the nuts. So, in deed, the screws are a bit too large for the nuts. I am absolutely sure I did not over tighten the screws. (I've been working on carbon frame bikes for years, using several types of tools, including torque wrenches.) I returned it and bought another one, thinking it was an isolated problem with that specific unit. The same thing happened to the second unit. I tried again, and, again, the same problem happened with the third unit. Conclusion: I can that the unit is well engineered and would work very well, if it wasn't for this issue. I will write to the manufacturer to inquire. Maybe it was a bad batch of screws or nut, or both. I'll keep trying, since I do believe the manufacturer can easily fix this problem and the reviews, both here and on other retailers sites virtually only say good things about this product. And also because there's not seem to be a bike mirror out there that can compare to this one in terms of quality and performance. Yes, I would recommend this product to other, but be aware that you might have to replace the mirror. Or you can try to find screws that are adequately sized. Good luck!"

326017,2,"I bought these liners for my daily commute to work in an urban area. Before purchasing them, I averaged around 1 puncture flat per week. The first day with the liners in place I got a puncture flat from a small piece of metal--it went right through the liner of my rear tire. Later that week, the front tire went flat as well--in this case it appeared that the liner had sliced through the inner tube. Of course, it is possible that the tube was defective, although I had been using it for months without any trouble. I took the liners out that week. It didn't help that I was using some cheap Performance brand tires that probably don't have much flat protection to begin with. However, I was really disappointed in these liners. I now have a Jamis Aurora (great bike BTW) that came with Vittoria Randonneur tires that supposedly have some double layer flat protection. I have had this bike for almost a year, and have not gotten a single flat! Instead of the Slime liners, I recommend just getting some good tires."

32236,2,"I normally don't write product reviews, but I'm amazed how differently supposedly simple products with reputable names can perform. We're talking, here, about vacuum bottles, not complex electronics or machines with moving parts.We have two three-month old daughters, and we needed a vacuum bottle to store boiled water for formulas. I bought the Stanley bottle, because Stanley has a good name, and it was by far the most attractive of all of the vacuum bottles. The color even matches our babies' bed.I brought the bottle home, followed the instructions pre-heating the bottle with regular hot water, then replaced this with boiled, bottled water. To our shock, the bottle became almost untouchable after 1/2 hour. After four hours, the water was no longer hot. It seems that a product that was supposed to hold the heat was actually removing the heat from the hot liquid inside and dissipating it on the surface of the outside. Needless to say, I returned the bottle to Walmart and got my money back.Since our old Thermos worked very well, I decided to pick up a Thermos (The Rock Beverage Bottle #2510RP) at The Sports Authority. Again, I followed the instructions and did the pre-heat. I was relieved that, after a half hour, the bottle was actually a bit chilled to the touch. With the Thermos, we're able to store usably warm water for about a day and a half. In contrast to the Stanley, we're very pleased with the Thermos and whole-heartedly recommend it."

311053,0,"I bought this beach shade to...of course...use on the beach. I have an 8 month old and he needed shade. I thought this looked super cool...and it was...after fighting with it in the 90 degree heat on a sandy beach as the baby screamed and cried. It took 15+ minutes to set up which doesn't seem like a long time but trust me when I say it was an eternity under the circumstances. So...15min to put up woudn't really prevent me from using it again because it was pretty near perfect once assembled.The teardown on the other hand was a trainwreck. Sure, it came down in like 5 minutes but the bag it comes in is much too small for the shade to EVER fit back into! The poles alone take up about half the space and unless you have serious origami skills, infinite patience, no wind, no sand, no water, no crying infant, you have no hope. I'm not sure why they'd make a carrying case that's about the size of a handbag, but they sure did.Overall, it's just OK in my book."
490374,0,It was shipped out very quickly. The knife was in great shape and packaging was intact. Very disapointed with the fit and finish of the knife. Blade had alot of play side to side and up and down. Very light to carry and I forget it is there but I don't know if I can trust it to anything more than light duty.
462902,0,"This is my 3rd Ab-Slider; although this one appears to be a cheaper made ""knock-off"" from the original. It has a smaller internal coil - which is the part that snaps and breaks after several months of use from any of these. I expect this one to break much sooner. I was looking for a deal - but should have known something was up when the shipping was almost as much as the Ab-Slider- I'm sure the seller padded the shipping cost to to make up for the lower cost of the slider."

134156,1,"This is the finest scope I have every owned in this price range. It is extremely bright, has 3.6"" eye relief which will every hunter/shooter will appreciate if they any gun with a good recoil. The 1"" tube makes finding scope rings very easy. Going from 3x to 9x is smooth and effortless. I like the Nikoplex reticle which is similar to a duplex reticle. This is where your cross hairs are larger on the outside edge of the view and fine toward the center.I like a rifle scope that is (1)easy to use and (2)sturdy and reliable in the elements and (3)comes with a good lifetime warranty.This scope has all three and is a perfect tool for the hunter who doesn't want to spend a bundle for a scope yet wants quality."
392725,1,"A good starter HRM. I liked that only one button is needed to access and change all the settings. However, if you want the convenience of having your HR shown as a percentage, or need a backlight because you exercise outdoors in the evenings, or track calories burned, or a unique code to prevent ""crosstalk"" with other HRM users close by, or be able to link to the Polar website, then this is not for you. Choose the FS2 or FS3.BOTTOMLINE: Before deciding on which HRM model to buy, define what your requirements are and check if the model you are choosing has these features."

319946,1,"I bought these brakes to replace my stock pads after about 300 miles wore them down. These pads come with many spacing rings that can be tailored to your bikes specific needs, and install quickly (as expected). The best thing about these brake pads is how quiet they are; almost noiseless even in the wet, and yet have great stopping power. They outperform my old set by far. I bought two sets, and will definitely buy again. I have yet to see how long they will last, but at this price point it doesn't really matter!"
436621,0,"Watch was fine except it was too small. Contacted seller about adding links to the band. ""They don't do that"". Have waited since 11/23,2007 for a refund and have not received it. I will file a claim. I have confirmation on the watch being returned."
143619,1,"I've used Pelican lights for years, and have always been impressed with the brightness of the light and quality of the product. A few years ago, I dropped my MityLite on in a parking lot and cracked the back end (evidently it landed just right because it'd been dropped many times before w/out issue). Although I'd had this light for several years, I thought I'd contact Pelican because it came with a lifetime warranty. The Pelican rep asked me to ship the light back to them, and they sent me a brand new replacement."
175005,0,"This is an OK watch. It has many or all the features of the more expensive watches at a good price. Cons: It is big. It eats batteries and takes two at a time. The degrees are in increments of five degrees. The buttons are near unreadable unless you color them somehow. The paint wears off immediately. It eats batteries like a mother but I understand they all do. It has something to do with it taking samplings every 5 seconds or something. Hard to find manual if you loose yours. Pros: The price. The features for the price. I paid $75, there may be other cheaper ones out there now. It has 3 alarms plus temp alarm and altitude alarm (if I read it correctly). I would say less than $50 would be a good deal if you want a watch that you do not have to worry about. I really have not worn it that much."
375875,2,"Agree with the other reviewer who noted that- despite claiming to fit all size tires- this product does not work with mountain bikes.Also, the screws are cheap, so when I tried to remove it from my wall I ended up having to drill the heads off of the screws.Maybe this works great for road bikes. But Delta's advertising claims are crap, and I doubt Ill buy anything made by them again since I won't know if it will work as advertised or not."

245615,0,"As other reviewers have noted, these shorts run small. Very small, or seen from another point of view, does not follow the current style of size deflation.According to the tag on the shorts, here is the sizing information based on waist size:22-24"" XS24-26"" S26-30"" M30-34"" L34-38"" XL38-42"" 2XL"

510695,1,"Received its first use this weekend by an otherwise finicky house guest, who claimed she got a ""comfortable good night's sleep"" on it. The hand pump worked efficiently and it stayed fully inflated for two nights (so far) of continuous use.Although I feel it has already paid back its modest cost, I expect it to provide many subsequent evenings of comfortable sleep."
105185,1,"This has all the features I wanted in a bike light - nice and bright; I can switch between steady or blinking, and the on/off is easy to access. The clip that attaches this to my under-seat bike bad is not very secure - my Blinky has come off several times when I've hit bumps or railroad tracks. I'll probably switch it to the direct mounting bracket for a more secure mount."
244192,0,"I bought this for a costume. It looks authentic enough and did the trick. It's a bit heavy -- combine that with the plastic buckle (which doesn't look too durable) and I wouldn't recommend this for any serious functional purposes. The snaps are ok and stay closed well enough. However, they can be tricky to closed again when you're wearing it."
374866,0,the united states marine corps flags I received were fine for the price I paid. The only rubs were the fact they were made in China (remember the Korean War) and the shipping was over 5 times the cost of the flags.

193071,1,"These gadgets are just terrific for building finger strength for violinists. It allows you to mimic the finger position and motion needed to push down on strings. It is particularly useful for building strength and agility in the little finger that are necessary for violinists to successfully execute fourth finger positions which are notoriously difficult for beginners. Keep in mind that higher reps with lower tension (as opposed to fewer reps with higher tension) is the best way to avoid muscle soreness and build strength. I recommend that violinists start off with the light tension (yellow) device, and gradually progress to the light tension (blue) and medium tension (red) devices. Again, start off slow with, say, 100 reps on the yellow device (each hand), building slowly up to 500 and then start substituting reps with the blue device for reps with the yellow device. Once you have built up to 500 reps with the blue device, you can start substituting red reps for blue ones. I see no need for a violinist to go beyond the red device. This is just a wonderful thing."
186099,2,"Beware: The hoodie I was sent was NOT the one I purchased! It was not a pullover as in the description but a zippered one. It was not heavy as in the description but a very light and flimsy one. It also was not made by Gildan as in the description but by American Apparel. At first I thought I was simply sent the wrong item, however the tag attached said ""Hooded Pullover Sweat Shirt...."" which it clearly isn't. I'm very disappointed."
338968,1,"I've had this pedometer for about two weeks and love it. I bought one for me and one for my boyfriend. We have been wearing them everyday just to see how much we walk during our regular daily routines, and to see how many steps we take during our walks and exercise. It automatically keeps track of your steps each day (7 day memory). You don't have to turn it on or set anything to start (it's on continuously, like a clock) - you just put it on in the morning and start walking! The only thing you have to do initially to set it is enter your step measurement your weight. I highly recommend this product to get to those 10,000 steps a day for weight loss and health!"

144656,0,"It's hard to beat this price for a pedometer, but you might want to pay a little more to beat the quality. The buttons are squishy and hard to push, it's difficult to open, and it has poor documentation.

146444,2,"Once this tricycle was finally assembled with all the right parts, my 2 yr old granddaughter loved it. The original shipment was missing parts. The manufacturer was contacted and sent replacement parts to the wrong address. After contacting the manufacturer again, the parts pack was sent to the correct address but parts were still missing. Another go-around resulted in the wrong parts again. Finally, we went to the store and bought them ourselves. When my granddaughter finally got on the trike the pedal kept coming off. After that was fixed the trike was great. We would have returned it, but by the time we were done trying to get the correct parts, it was too late to send it back. I would recommend never buying this product. I would recommend tha Amazon stop carrying it. Amazon was great however. They did refund my priority shipping."
294092,1,"I actually use this in my 98 Caravan. The gear shift is on the steering column, as is the case with many vans or pick-ups. When the shifter is in ""D"", it puts the GPS at the perfect location both for visiblity and ease of use. I think an actual dash mount would make it too hard to read or use. Also, don't forget to check out the auto power adapter. When you run the eTrex on external power, you can keep the light on all the time. This is great when you are driving at night."
153700,0,"The compression shorts are basically what you pay for. The material quality is good, but the assembly lacks. The seams are large & can cause hot spots on long runs rather than prevent.

274123,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."

I love my Wii fit, but more for the fun of the balance games and the balance board that I can use with other games than the actual workout. I love My Fitness Coach. It's a great workout for me...kinda like a workout DVD, but there is enough change to keep me happy. But this game is THE best! I like that I can pick which exercises I want to do. It's like the best of both worlds (Fit and Fitness Coach). I also have Gold's Gym, but I haven't tried it yet (got it more for hubby as he loved the boxing on Wii Fit). I have We Cheer too and Dance Dance Revolution 2. And I didn't buy Jillian's game due to poor reviews. This is seriously the best video game workout for me. I started out with the 20 minute workout on easy(I didn't want to start the 30 day challenge yet because my baby is only 2 months and I can't workout consistently just yet). I was sweating by the second exercise and had to push through to make it to the end. I am 27 5'3 and 161 pounds. Pre-pregnancy I was 127 pounds. I am in pretty good shape usually."

Pulled the thread on a button and the button dropped off. This is an exception with these shirts. It was worth sewing it back on.----I've had to downgrade my rating of this shirt. Due to what I guess was the move to less expensive production, you'll have to plan on always sewing some of the buttons back on after they fall off. It's become a regular occurrence, not just an exception... too bad. A mediocre shirt doesn't really belong in the Smithsonian... in my opinion, anyway."

I plan to purchase the nylon strapping and have sewn on myself which is an aggravation.

I thought the price was a little high, considering that I could get an entire gi of decent quality...both top and bottom...for just a little bit more from other manufacturers...but I guess the option of packaging and handling a ""split"" set does add to the overall cost. (That's what added so much to the cost...the shipping and handling part.) HOWEVER, I cannot complain about the workmanship and overall quality of the item that I received. It is made of a very rugged material, and is put together very well. It should hold up during many hours of hard training."

187115,0,"These aren't all THAT bad, but seem slightly long. I'm a big guy, and the sizing was pretty much spot on in the waist. The only real sizing complaint I have is the thighs.. they are abnormally tight for some reason. I am a cyclist and have pretty meaty thighs, but these are oddly tight. Don't get me wrong though, they aren't spandex tight.. or so tight that I wouldn't wear them. Just tight enough to not fit perfectly.The quality of the material is impressive. Adidas is normally good about using good quality material, and that they did in this case. They are a bit warm, but they do well on rather cold fall jogs. They have lasted me about a year and still are in good shape, so even though they are a bit expensive I suppose I got my money out of them."
440868,2,I bought a Century heavyweight gi a few years and it was better quality than this one. My old one is a size 5 and I lost a lot of weight. I am now 5:6 and 155 pounds.

They didn't charge me the re-stocking fee that was part of the original agreement.5 stars for BlackBeltShop but only 2 for Century for this mediocre quality dogi.I bought a Tokaido on eBay for $115. It is the difference between a Rolls and a Ford Maverick.
342346,0,"The problem with these is that the liner inside fits in a way that the crotch of the exterior of the shorts rides really low, and creates an unattractive pouch in the front, like you are hiding some kind of accident in your pants. I don't know about you, but when I spend money on workout clothes, I expect them to be functional, but I don't think it's too much to expect them not to look weird. Other than this, the quality of the materials is great, so if you by chance have a body type that can wear these a bit better, I would recommend trying them on in the store first to make sure, which unfortunately kind of defeats the convenience of online shopping."
276776,0,"I bought some UFC gloves and my hands fit fine. These Everlasts are a bit tight, especially around the finger webs. If you read the reviews they're all pretty mediocre. I'd say ante up the money and get some quality. I'm not impressed with this purchase, even at $25."
277592,0,I think for the price that it is a good buy.It is light and quiet no need to adjust the volume on the tv while rowing.compact enough that I store it under the bed and pull it out for use.The only complaint is that it provides perhaps too much resistance. I am 6'4 210 lbs and I use it on the easiest setting. I hope that the resistance cylinders loosen up with more use. I can't imagine anyone being able to smoothly row on the hardest setting.I got it to get a work out during the the winter and with out a doubt it will leave you sweaty.
410790,0,"These ankle weights work very well; the construction is good and they hold up nicely. Being able to work your way up one pound at a time is great. But they are truly painful. I'm a small woman with small ankles, but that shouldn't matter. Regardless of how big your ankles are, the weights just gouge into the bones as you walk. I've doubled over wash cloths and pinned them around my ankles, and they still kill me. I have permanent bruises at my ankle bones. The manufacturer really needs to attach some kind of heavy-duty padding to the back to prevent this from happening. I wear them, but I don't think I'd buy them again."

390077,2,"I bought the X9 to take to Afghanistan with me as a backup navigation tool. Fortunately I did not use it as a primary tool. First, when it arrived, the battery would not completely charge after the first charging. I was able to send it back to the supplier and received a replacement. When using the X9, it is slow to aquire satelites. The Garmin that I was using for primary navigation is much better, quicker and more reliable. After using the X9, mainly for a watch, it just stopped working after about 6 months. The display went blank. By that time, I no longer had the box or receipt. I sent Suunto a letter requesting some kind of support. They never replied. Buy a Garmin and save your money!!!!!"
319818,0,"I am fairly new on the reformer, but have taken some private lessons on it. This is a very slow moving DVD. If you have any experience on the reformer, you would be disappointed with this product. I think the problem is that Moira explains every little move at a snails pace (I'm not going fast). I wish she would discuss the movement as she does it, not as the model does it."
190282,1,I have twin 7 year old boys. I've bought several goggles over the years and these are the first ones that do not leak or fog. My boys are happy with them so I am thrilled. I purchased the clear and now I will be buying more for friends and family that come over to swim so we will have enough on hand. I rarely do reviews so this means something!!!
122253,0,"The vest is comfortable overall. I don't know about the other sizes but the 4XL-7XL has two unshown, lower straps that apparently go between the legs. The straps were not uncomfortable, even while sitting, but I returned the vest because of the indignity of wearing it while sailing (and the possibility of an unexpected painful shift). The side adjustment straps are well-designed for a wide range of bodies. I thought about keeping it and cutting off the lower straps but decided to return it."

262044,0,well first i was happy about getting the gun. this gun is very UN accurate. it cant shoot a soda can from 20feet first try. the clips are really nice but sometimes UN reliable it sometimes don't feed into the gun. the silencer makes the gun more accurate but ts still weak. the regaluar barral is stupid i puttedf it on and it shoots to the right sometimes. i looked into the barrel and i saw a big bump ring in it i think thats why the regular barrel was gay. i would of rate this a 5 star but just the accuratcy is really dumb. its a 240 fps gun. oh and a really gay thing about the gun when you ajust the hop up and put it to normal it adjustes by it self all the way to hop its a really werid gun buy this if you started to play with airsoft and make sure you buy extra clips.

330485,1,I bought this for one of my sons birthday - now the three of them us it. They find it quick and easy to use - get a good burn and they store away easily
299662,0,I bought this because I need a low impact way to get my cardio in. My feet pronate with each bounce and My knees hurt as a result.The only time they do not pronate is when I run on it as shown by the creator of this thing. I get really bored doing one movement for cardio.I have tried correcting the pronation by watching a YouTube video for another rebounder. I still pronate.Maybe I am not giving myself enough time to learn how not to pronate.The bouncing is fun and feels good to my body. I hear it is good for the lymph system. I will keep it for bouncing but I am now searching for other ways to get my cardio. What a bummer.
486347,0,Used it on a trip to BWCAW in October in about 40 degree weather. Kept me warm and comfy. Quick drying. Only reason it didn't receive more stars was because the sizing was a little funky.

I'm just an aircraft enthusiast, but I'm fairly certain the side of the aircraft is supposed to match up with the top.Again, its not a bad kit overall (and as a matter of fact I plan on acquiring another one of these to make G1 Blades for my 1:48 Autobots) but it does have its problems."

148936,1,We love this! We hang it out on our deck every Sunday morning -- it is windy out there and rains a lot and this thing is durable and bright and still looks new even after the season. does not look worn or faded at all. And it was the BIGGEST one we could find. People joke that they can see if from the next County. Hee Hee. Great item!
285180,1,"I've been thinking about Invicta for a while because they have so many nice looking watches. The price almost scared me because, well, an automatic for under $100? Like others, I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived last week. My Watch World did a great job getting it right out.It's rock solid, has an amazing finish and it works! The stainless/abalone watch case alone is worth $100!I left it back in the box over the weekend and when I took it out on Monday it was right on time. (pretty good for 48 hours of still time - not bad Miyota) This morning I went surfing with it because I figured, what the heck? I usually wear my Timex Expedition for surfing/kayaking, etc. because it's light, accurate and around $30; but my new Invicta worked great!Anyway, I will be buying more Invictas. Maybe another automatic because they're so cool (love the exhibition back) and surely a couple of quartz models because they're just always correct with the time and date. I'm not too concerned about the slow service issues I've heard about Invicta, mainly because at this price point the shipping to and from may just be close to the price of the watch!Finally, the 40mm case size (without the crown) is perfect, it's beefy without taking over an average to smaller wrist. (I've had a few of those huge watches that make me look like I'm 4 again wearing my dad's watch!)"
305876,2,"The seller was nice and all but when I expressed that this item was not what I payed for she told me shed reimburse me for the item but on for the shipping, so either way I was screwed out of money. I was livid! The description of this item was completely deceiving, I wanted a silent (as in makes no sound) stop watch. Not only was the watch loud, it did not have a silent option or even an off/on button! SILENT OPERATION does not mean that it is silent even if the description says silent option. Now I'm stuck with a loud constantly ON stopwatch."
448612,1,"My husband and I each ordered one of these and are happy.ASSEMBLY There is some putting together that you have to do, but it's fairly simple. Sorry, no more details there--I left that to the honey.HEIGHT Even at its lowest seat setting, it seems a bit tall for me (I'm about 5'2 or 5'3), but that's not the bike's fault I guess.GEARS It has lots of gears, which is helpful for going up and down hills. We both find that the gear changes are jerky and delayed.SEAT The seat is not bad as far as bike seats go. My husband got a wider, cushier one at Target for $20 to replace the one it came with. I think I'll stick to the one already on it.GRIPS The handle grips are comfortable and also provide some grip, so your hands don't slide around if they sweat.HANDLEBAR The handlebar shape is great--you can sit up straight and ride it, which is why I got it (I have a bad back).TREAD Tires have nice tread for a non-mountain bike.ACCIDENT Incidentally, I took mine out for a spin a week ago without my husband (who keeps me going at a slower pace). As the speed demon I am, I was rolling downhill awfully fast when I saw that the sharp curve ahead would not be navigable at my speed, so I braked quickly. The breaks work--er, well. Perhaps too well--I skidded and fell, and am still bandaging my wounds (one of which is equivalent to a 2nd degree burn--ow!). But I am convinced this was ""user error,"" perhaps exacerbated by the fact the seat is a little too high for me. And while I have cuts and bruises in multiple places, the bike suffered only three very small scuffs. So it's surely durable.OVERALL IMPRESSION A great value, especially with Amazon's free shipping."
171832,0,"Good grip, nice and cool for hot days. The backing was too stretchy, so when hard passes come in, the palm sticky part sticks to the ball and the glove rotates on your hand. You end up with the slippery spandex backing on your palm making it hard to hang on to the ball after the catch.Other than that, a very good, light glove for summertime catches. Typical Under Armor super sticky palms for the first few games. After that they wear fast."
132945,2,"I thought I'd like this tacklebox, but I do not! The entire unit is softside which makes it lightweight (good), but when you remove something from the bottom section the entire thing collapses because there's no longer anything to hold it up. I also found that the cloth gets dirty/wet. I used this tacklebox for a long weekend of camping/fishing and immediately retired it upon my return home. If I hadn't used it, I'd return it."

I took a chance and ordered it anyway and am thrilled I did! This jacket fits wonderfully and although it says 2x it's reallly a 1x. My advice is to take the chance and order the bigger size, it just might fit and the jacket looks great."

349242,0,"Just received the watch today and am impressed on how rugged the watch looks. In setting the date I did notice under step 2 the following:""The calendar function of this watch operates on a 31-day cycle. It is necessary to change the date to the first day of the following month manually by turning the crown for months having less than 31 days"".This means that the user will need to manually adjust the date at the end of the following months: February, April, June, September and November.I must admit I was surprised that this needed to be done. This also means that on leap years that the user needs to be aware and update the date manually after the 29th of February.Consequently, just be aware that this is not a completely hands off watch even with the Eco-Drive. I am going to return this watch and look for another one instead."

They are a bit too short for biking because they fold up while you ride so it gets uncomfortable, but for running these would be great. It feels great on the skin too. Overall a great product for men and women. Though I must say it would look much better on a skinny women than a guy. (my opinion)."

280639,0,"The weights in the handles made a noticeable difference in the effort it took to keep the momentum going. Initially I could only perform 1/2 of what I do before my shoulders or forearms were burnt out. At 5' 11 the rope was not too short, but perfect. The only draw back was that the rope itself broke on me after week 3. The hard, black plastic on the outside snapped in the center and revealed the cloth string. No biggy I just used electrical tape and it was has been fine ever since(5+weeks)."

88820,2,"I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them, so much so that I have not worn them at all."
194573,0,"I bought two. They are roundish heavy balls.Each has two decals on it. One has the numerical weight, and the other says ""Made in China."" How do they decide where to put the stickers? Same way they do it for peaches. Put the sticker over the bad spot. One ball had its numerical weight sticker over the rough spot where they cut off a plug or the casting sprue. It will need the attention of a file. The other ball had its ""Made in China"" sticker over a sharp edged casting void that I will fill with epoxy so I don't cut my hand on it.That gray color isn't iron. It's gray paint. Really low quality gray paint. The balls were a little bit dirty, and I wiped them off with denatured alcohol, figuring that would take the dirt and grease off. It also makes the paint gummy and causes it to flake and peel. I may just strip off the original paint and re-coat them with Rustoleum. I'm a little worried how bad they will look under the original paint.Overall, they are definitely cheap. You are not going wrong by too much if you paid only $15 a piece for them. If you want something nice, you will be disappointed."

And here's why:* Under Product Features, inseam length was left out - it is (approximately) 27.25-inches long.* The company logo is not embroidered, but fused (to minimize the labor costs). Expect the company logo to be peeled off in the future.* Under Product Description, it reads, ""Dual-layer EVO ColdGear fabric..."" But it is NOT men's UA EVO ColdGear Legging. It is men's ColdGear Action Legging, instead. What is the difference? UA EVO ColdGear Legging comes with working fly.* The fabric does not provide 360 Reflectivity, and will NOT keep your legs warm in cold temperature.* The fitting is ""compression"" - ultra-tight, second-skin fit feel (imagine you are wearing women's pantyhose).* Unless you want to see some dark color stains on your skin, wash it in cold water/no bleach before wearing.* By the way, this garment is made in Southeast Asia."

I like the rear mounted buttons. The holo reticle is just a sweet piece of engineering and I found it to be very accurate. The 512 is sold as the Eotech's ""basic"" model of red dot, however, it's anything but basic. The 512 is high end compared to all the other red dots. Trust me, this is one superb peice of gear. If you want it and you can hide it from disapproving family members, just get it.The only con: $ticker $hock."

The only problem with this shirt, and it's a big one, is that the size is waaayyyy off. I would venture to say 2 sizes off. I ordered a large, as I am a large in every other brand including other Columbia product lines, but this shirt was so big I could fully loaded ruck sack underneath it!!Seriously, it is at least one size larger than labeled but I would venture to say it might even be 2 sizes too large. I'm going to give it to my dad who typically wears a XXL and see if it fits him. Bottom line, do not order this shirt online unless you have confirmed your size in a store first."
162391,0,"I saw this camera on sale during a 4th of July sale at a sporting store that was way out of town. It was 50% off. I looked at it and thought the camera will obviously not take good pictures or videos and will need alot of light to make things look decent. I could probably find it cheaper elsewhere if I looked online. So I went home, did some reseach on the internet and decided that I want it (for mountain biking, skiing, drag racing, etc). I went out of town again just to pick it up (savings negated by gas cost and my time).That night I decided that since I'm going to walk around the block, I'm going to try out the digital hero. Put the batteries in and walked around. I was out for about 15 minutes, but I could not shut the thing off once I got home. I pulled the battery out and back in to reset it. Went to my computer to view the video and found a zero length file (it's corrupt). I tried taking short videos and that would cause the camera to lock up. The prospect of making that long journey back to the store for an exchange and/or a refund didn't sit well with me so I tried a few things. I took a few pictures, which seems to work. Some pics came out quite dark. I figured perhaps I had an SD card that it didn't like so I put another one in. Same issue - camera would lock up when taking videos. Pictures came out ok. If a took a few, the latter ones would be darker, even with the exact same scene. I had a hunch.. I then replaced the made in China batteries with Duracell brand battery.. Ah, that was it! I was able to take videos. If the prev batteries were good, then I'm expecting about 15 minutes or so with these Duracell batteries (maybe more) and it seems other have gotten about the same amount of time. Recording seems to drain the battery fast.The pictures and videos are just ok, but I think daytime pictures would be decent (haven't gotten a chance to check it out yet).I tried a 4GB sd card (knowing it probably won't work). The unit would not turn on with that card. In fact, the LCD look like it was on, but the display was blank (the lcd shimmered). So a 4GB card defintately will not work.I am going to hardwire 3v dc to the unit so I can take it on long trips and use it as a car cam.The product fills a niche market. It has an excellent waterproof case and does the job. I have to give this unit a 3 star because of the high battery consumption and the poor low light performance in both picture and video mode. It does have a few things I didn't expect: time lapse and burst mode photo mode which I was looking for in a higher end camera. I just could not bring myself to give it a 4 star. A more appropriate score would probably be 3.5. If you just a device that takes you tube quality type pictures, this is a good product considering the price I got it for.It's a keeper for me. I have an HD camera so if I wanted something high quality, I will use that, but never in the water or reluctantly during skiing or mountain biking.UPDATE 7/7: this thing sucks battery like no tomorrow. I was able to get less than 5 minutes of video recording, then it shut down (I'm not exactly sure how long, but it didn't last long). Of course the video was corrupt. I then proceeded to take a snapshot every 5 sec.. that work for 93 pics until the camera shut down. In video mode, the unit uses alot of power... i'm going to try some Energizer Lithium Battery, which a few people have success with. I'll be back..UPDATE 7/9: got some generic nimh aaa. I can now take about 10-13 minutes of video before it stops (these are actual video times before the camera stops the recording. Files are no longer corrupt because there is enough juice for the camera to safely stop video recording). But I can continue taking pictures until the battery runs out... about 500-600 pics every 5 secs. I'm going to try some name brand nimh aaa. My goal is to be able to take an hour of video with a set of rechargeables.UPDATE 7/15: do not get the energizer rechargeable nimh 900mah batteries. First charge, videos recording lasted less than 10 seconds. Second try I charged it up for over 12 hours and immediately put it into the Digital Hero 3 and got 3 minutes. I thought these brand name nimh batteries would last alot longer - apparently not. They're going back to the store. I'm going to try these again a few more time so they'll go through 3 full charge/discharge cycles before I consider these as poor!UPDATE 8/2: I returned the Energizers and Ultralasts (900 and 1000mah, respectively). The Ultralast rechargeables lasted longer than the Energizers! I got the BC900 battery charger and the Engerizers show a capacity of about 600mah and a little higher for the Ultralast. I'm now using Duracell recharageables which show a capacity of about 950mah and seem to last the longest, although not spectacular at over 10 minutes and over 1000 pictures after it cannot take any more videos."

393110,0,"This game was definitely fun, and cool. However, I found the 2nd game better, because this one, Street 3, doesn't really have a story line. In Street 2 you are trying to move up the ranks to be able to play, and defeat, Xhibit. In Street3, it just kind of ends. All of a sudden, it just says CHAMPION! What's up with that? Also, in Street 2, when they talk their mouths actually move. In Street 3 the words come out but they're just moving their bodies, not their lips. But enough negativity towards this game. Street 3 is awesome in the way that you can customize your entire team, just the way you want. I liked the places you get to play at and I liked the bonus footballs you could earn (rather than a Street football, you could play with a baseball football, eyeball, fireball, etc.). I would reccomend this game, no doubt, but I do acknowledge the fact that its predecessor is better."

It looked like it would be a sage-ey light green based on the color sample shown for this mat but it turned out to be a really bright, lime green instead.Disappointed that the color sample didn't really match the actual mat color, but the mat's thickness was what I was looking for, so I guess I'll suck it up and choose to ignore the color and wear this puppy out as soon as I can so that I can replace with a more subtle color."

98544,1,"This shirt is great! I can't stand not having a breast pocket, thats why people rarely see me in a plain T-Shirt. The material is very soft and feels high quality.

Thats not a bad thing, now I know to order true to size next time. The color held up well for some reason. I wash my clothes pretty hard, and somehow the dark blue still looks nice and didn't fade out. I use this mostly as a gym shirt in the fall and it is always comfortable... I think I can openly say that this is the most comfortable pocketed T-Shirt i've ever purchased."

My son held both hands on day one, one on day two, and by day three he was off and running. Imagine my surprise that by day four he was wizzing around everywhere completly unaided. So in short parents, be prepared to be running up and down the street with your child for half an a hour a day for say three or four days, so that they don't give up."

453370,0,"This step is OK, but not as good as the Reebok step. The ridged deck tends to catch on the soles of your shoes and you have to be careful to seat the step on the risers just right. If you need to turn the step during your workout, you can't do it quickly because the risers don't attach, they just sit under the platform. Still, it's a way better step than those cheapie $19.95 plastic ones. Sturdy and stable as long as you get the risers in the right place."
484486,0,"Overall the product is well built and can easily handle the advertised 250lbs. However, if you are on the high end of the weight scale and in some form of reasonable fitness the maximum resistance will not be enough for you.After having a few upright bikes I can say that this reclining model is much easier on your back and wrists. The padding on the seat does leave a little to desire, but it's easily bearable for 1hr rides.All needed parts were included and it went together in about 30 minutes.Like everything else in the world you get what you pay for. The computer frequently will not turn itself off even after hours of non-use. The dial to adjust the tension broke after the first day (springs back to max resistance when you set it). You can get around this with a little bit of tape to stick it where you want it. Realistically though, you won't be using this bike on anything but the hardest setting - so it's not that much of an impact for me.In summary, this is a great bike to buy if you don't have very strong legs, or are a casual exerciser. I'm not in fantastic shape but the hardest resistance is really a little too easy. It is made in China but does seem reasonably well engineered. The faults with it can easily be overlooked (unlike other bikes the resistance is set mechanically, the computer could completely die on this bike and you wouldn't miss out on anything). It seems like it will be fairly durable, when/if it does break mechanically I will probably try a different model in the same price range."
411749,0,"I waited over a year before purchasing this machine since I wanted to be absolutely sure of my purchase. In that time, I continued to read reviews for it here, and everywhere, and the consistency of higher-than-average reviews finally convinced me. But the devil is always in the details.My biggest problem starting out was that the platform did not glide smoothly over the frame. To this day, it's a big reason why I still hesitate to get on it. There's a grinding, and it's annoying. I greased the metal, that helped a little; I repositioned my body, that helped slightly more. I'm 5'3 and an athletic 145 lbs--so there shouldn't be any reason why I'd be too big for a machine made to accommodate people 100 lbs heavier. Overall, however, the grinding has created a lasting impression of mediocrity.My second problem was/is the ability to get an effective workout for anything other than my arms and back. I was able to come up with a way to work my abs by putting my hands on the bottom plate and pushing the platform backwards with my knees, but working my chest, legs, or utilizing the cardio workout on the exercise chart was impossible. I'm convinced that because of my height, I just can't position myself in a way that'll hit the right muscles properly. I know what it feels like to hit the weights hard, and this isn't it.I give it three stars because it's not totally useless and does provide some benefit. Minus the grinding. 6/6/11"

I'm assuming that it was deliberately in very small chunks, but, and I do NOT think that it was the fault of Amazon's packaging, which seemed fine, it was mostly powder when it arrived. Dried chicken powder isn't appealing on any level to me. Also, why put the equivalent of a quarter of a cup of dried chicken powder in a pouch that would hold considerably more, even reconstituted?I'm giving it three stars because it was chicken powder that tasted like chicken, but I do not think I'll purchase this again."

384607,0,"Not the most useful piece of exercise equipment I own, but probably the least expensive. Worth it? Probably, if you use it. It's a little boring and I'm easily entertained. It doesn't take much to amuse me. I haven't given up though.This product appears to be well made and easy to use. The design is good and it works well. Moving around is better than not moving, as long as you are careful not to fall if you are a klutz (or lack balance) like me. For someone who is active anyway, it's possible to get the thing going and get the kinks out with it. I'll probably be doing slow, yoga-like moves on it, not the Chubby Checker-style twist. :)More importantly, for a person who never exercises and otherwise would be on the couch, I can see this serving an important purpose, IF done on a regular schedule and not just shoved in a drawer. In other words, it's possible to 'make it work' if motivated. A heavier person probably needs the larger version made by another manufacturer. In fact, the reason I got interested is because I saw about 5 seconds of a participant using the larger version on a show called, ""Dance Your _ Off!"" If it gets you off the couch, you'll want to do other kinds of exercises, so it could be the answer for some, another piece of junk in the junk drawer for others.For me, I bought it so when I really DO want to just curl up on the couch and watch a favorite television show, like ""The Biggest Loser"" (I'm 20 lbs. overweight right now), instead of feeling lazy and guilty about being lazy, I can watch THEM work out and feel like I'm working up a sweat or increasing my range of motion too. I would call it 'movement' instead of actual exercise, but movement is good. Many of us need to 'move' more.I bought 2 of these small 'size 6' twist boards and a larger one, because I obsess about exercise equipment and wanted to compare them.My balance is poor anyway, so I really have to be careful, especially on the large one, but actually on the small ones too.The small ones are so easy to just pick up (with one hand) and toss in a drawer, or closet, or under a chair or bed. That is a major advantage. I get more of a variety and range of motion on either the large one or using 2 of the small ones. I can do a sort of 'lunge-twist' using 2 small ones. On the large one I seem to be able to get more of a 'twist', and it is solid and heavy, almost like a real piece of exercise equipment. It's still light enough to carry around and shove into a closet or under a bed. You'll get a little exercise benefit from picking that thing up. It definitely is not as light-weight as the Everlast. The larger one costs more, so if cost is a huge issue, start out with the small one and see if you would use it or if you would just toss it in a drawer before you order the larger one. If you like the smaller ones, I think you'll really like the larger model."

432164,1,"I was very pleased with this pack on arrival. The pack is easily adjustable to a variety of torso sizes. It has plenty of room and fits nicely on my average height but more than average girth. If someone has a really small waist size then I may be a little concerned with the belt size however I think there is a little more range than suggested by other reviewers. I had a companion try this on with a 34 in waist and he had a nice fit and could snug up more if needed.All the access is via a top load that provides about 10 or so liters of additional space if needed or via the bottom access for the sleeping bag compartment. In the main compartment I am able to fit my 3 person trail tent, and all my clothes, food and other supplies for a 4 day/3 night backpacking trip through the mountains for all but winter conditions. I am actually able to pack all my gear within my pack so nothing is exposed externally. If you have an ultra light/ultra compressible bag + a compact camping pad it is easily possible to get the bag and pad into the space together. In fact, I am able to fit my all of the following into the sleeping bag compartment without issue:Lafuma Warm n' Light 600g Sleeping Bag (Orange/Grey, 40-Degree, Regular, Left Zip)Therm-a-Rest ProLite Plus MattressSea to Summit Dry Lite Towel (XS, SM, MD, LG or XL)Light My Fire Deluxe MealKitThere are only a few eternal pockets: two mesh water bottle pockets 1 on each side, one top pocket on the main compartment cover flap and one rope pocket on the back of the pack that is where all the compression straps are attached to. Nevertheless this appears sufficient for being able to have your fast access items available to you.The integrated rain fly is a nice addition and is easy to deploy and works really well in my initial testing.The only two issues I have with the bag at present is that it is a little heavy (5+ pounds empty) and the waist belt can be a bit difficult to cinch down as tight as I want it. Not much I can do about the former and for this price it is quite reasonable, but for the latter I found that if I tighten it a little more unfastened and then fastened belt it worked.All in all a solid pack for the price. I will be heading off on my first 4 day/3 night trip with this pack in two weeks and will update this review then based on my experience using it in the field."

They're durable and incredibly comfortable. To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps. These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat. The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed. There's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy. Not sure why these pants aren't water cooler talk, but after trying a pair you'll wonder why also. Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake. But you'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version."

428294,0,"Purchased this product to add a Gerber to my collection of multitools. Wanted to try a Freehand or Flik but decided to try this first, as the price was okay.Pros:- Lightweight, compact, very easy to carry.- Pliers are of good quality, finish on entire tool is consistent throughout.- Tools contained are adequate for my purposes.- One-hand flick out ability is fantastic. This by itself almost makes owning this tool worthwhile - provided you use the pliers a lot.Cons:- Several reviews have already mentioned the different knife blade from the pictures here. Normally, it would not be much of an issue, but the design of the new blade, which is practically a straight cutting edge utility knife blade with no curving belly for angled cutting, negates the design of the handle. When using it for cutting, the opposite handle of the tool gets in the way. If it were the blade pictured here, the angled cutting edge near the tip would be easier to use, but the new blade, being straight, only cuts like a box cutter, but not as sharp. Additionally, the nail nick is on the wrong side of the blade.- There is no nail nick or notch on the can opener, forcing you to open it by trying to pull on the sharp edge.- Pliers do not retract fully, leaving a pointed end to dig into your hand when using it.- Fit of the pliers head is so loose, it shakes like a rattle. I know it is a compromise to help you deploy it one-handed, but it just screams low quality.If you need to carry around a handy pair of pliers which includes additional tools, then go for it. But if you demand good ergonomics and quality from your multitool, look elsewhere."

317908,0,"The watch looks better in the photo than it does in actuality. I like a large faced watch, and that it is, however it's not excessively big. The face is nice, the band is what cheapens it.

404248,0,"It was difficult for me to find this tool online, but I was able to locate it and purchase it from another web store (ebikestop.com), because at the time Amazon did not have it on their website. This tool is for adjusting and removing bottom brackets on some bargain and older bikes (I have a Dyno High-Altitude mountain bike manufactured by Pacific Cycle), most notably cheaper Schwinns and Mongoose models.I'll go out on a limb and say it's impossible to use this tool in itself to loosen a frozen bottom bracket that has never been worked on in two years (such as in my case). It's not long enough to provide enough leverage (I use the slotted end), and it's also very thin to the point it ALMOST feels flimsy, although the purpose of its thinness is so you can use this in conjunction with a lock ring spanner such as thePark Tool HCW-5 Lock Ring Spanner(which I purchased on Amazon) to adjust the bottom bracket cup without removing the pedal crank arm. I tried using an adjustable-end wrench (i.e. Crescent Wrench) to remove the bottom bracket cup, but the raised flats on the cup aren't tall enough for the jaws of the wrench to grasp, so the wrench kept slipping. I saturated the bottom bracket threads overnight, first with WD40, and thenTri-Flow Superior Lubricant Aerosol, 12oz. Finally, I resorted to taking a hammer and nail punch to the bottom bracket, alternately tapping on opposite flats until the cup began to move, something I DO NOT RECOMMEND UNLESS YOU PLAN TO REPLACE THE BOTTOM BRACKET ASSEMBLY, then I was able to use the HCW-11 to loosen and finally remove it.As stated, once you do frequent adjustments (as you should for preventive maintenance), this tool is the only way to go."
377967,0,"This is a decent rack for the price and would serve lightweight use on a mountain bike that has no supports for a normal rack...BUT...be advised that two things will happen, one probably correctable and one not.1. The rack may shift around with weight on it, no matter how tight you dare to make it. Some kind of non-slip material needs to go inside the clamp (I don't have the quick release type, but the bolt-on type)2. If you use panniers large enough to accept a grocery bag, the bag *will* slam against your tires and spokes, because the pannier supports are too flexible (you get what you pay for). But if you are just stuffing panniers with clothing or other light items, no problems.I ended up putting this one up for sale and bought a ""mountain man"" rack, which is 3X the price and 3X stronger, and does not flex because it can mount to the axle, with extensions."
52521,0,"Looks great. Yes, it should be fine for a couple of teenagers horsing around. BUT, it could do some serious damage (not the fun kind). It is incredibly hard and could break fingers.

102279,1,I bought a brand new folding bicycle and it was very tricky to assemble. For the first few rides this tool was incredibly handy for me since I needed to make some adjustments on the road.

97085,1,"I got a pair of these as a gift earlier this year. I was playing in MN at the time, and absolutely loved them during the early spring season games when the sand was still 40-50 degrees. They do a good job of keepng your feet clean and are great on days when the sand is cold/hot/wet, etc. The only downside to them is that they only lasted me one summer of play (2 leagues per week + occasional pick up games, so probably about 100 games total). That said, I'm buying another pair today.Update (Feb 2012): My new pair lasted only about 50 games. However, the sand that I play on now is very course (really a fine gravel), so I did not expect the pair to last long, and wearing them with holes is still better than bare feet."

477449,0,"When I was buying, I looked at the 203 and 213. I couldn't figure out what the difference was between the two. The only thing I noticed was that on the Schwinn website it says the 203 has 8 resistance levels vs 16 for the 213. If you looked at other websites though, they list both as having 16. I finally went with the 213 because (1)I figured Schwinn would know their product best, (2) it looked liked more people were buying the 213.Like many reviewers, I have a problem with the positioning of the display. I can live with the tilt angle since I could still read it but my problem is its positioned so high it blocks my view of the tv.I won't go into the condition of the box when it arrived as that has been covered enough. One minor part (the rear stabilizer) was damaged. I contacted Schwinn for a replacement, they sent me the wrong part. I tried again and they promised to sent the part again but never did. Not a big problem since the bike still works fine with the damaged part.A few weeks after I bought the bike, I happened to see the 203 on sale at a local store. I finally found out what the major difference was. The 203 looks exactly the same but is built on a smaller scale. For a guy my height (5'7""), the 203 is just the right size. I didn't get to check how many levels it actually had but personally having 8 vs 16 isn't a deal breaker because I've only used up to 5 levels."

463184,0,"I dont know what I could be doing wrong. I tried this 5 times in 2 days and was very dissapointed. I am really stressing trying to find a good thermos that works for my daughter at day care. I dont microwave any of her food so I want to give her warm options at daycare. I read all the great reviews and thought this would be perfect. I boiled water put it in the cup for 12 minutes. Heated the pasta to very hot and after dumping the water out of the thermos immediately put the pasta in so I would not let any heat escape. I screwed the lid on tight and made sure it was on properly. 3 hours later the pasta is cold. What am I doing wrong?? It must be me since so many people have had good experiences. There are 4 hours between when I make lunch and my daughter eats there is no way this would stay warm for that long. I think maybe liquids would stay warm in this but not regular foods. Did I just get a faulty thermos? I really wanted to keep this its really cute to. My sister said stainless steel thermos's never worked for her either, maybe I will try the plastic insulated kind.REVIEW UPDATE 1/21/11Instead of returning this item I had amazon replace it. I figured since so many people on so many websites gave this a good review that there must have been an issue with my food jar. I am not entirely convinced that every reviewers food jar worked I really doubt some tested it before they sent there child out with it. But like a said I ordered a replacement tested it last night 1/20/10 and it 4 hours later the food was still quite warm, perfect temperature for my 1 year old. So I think that maybe my original food jar had a faulty vacuum which if it fails will not keep food warm. I plan on testing it a few more times over the weekend before sending her out with it but it was warm at 2 hours and warm at 4 hours. My first food jar didnt even keep the food warm for an hour."

114935,1,This is a great bicycle computer. The 8 functions are all you'll ever need. I'm technically challenged so I was afraid it would be complicated to go through the functions. It's so simple and easy. Just press the button. And the computer is small so it's not distracting but still very readable. My husband installed it on my bike in less than 15 minutes. I would highly recommend this product.
141914,1,"Shirt quality: material thickness is comparable to undershirts. On a scale of 1-5, with 5 being thick, I give these a 3. Size: I purchased large and was happy with the fit and length as I am tall. As you may know, some larges are too tight and some too big, these fit good. The burnt orange was a bit brighter than expected. Shipping: the more you buy the better the shipping rates. One shirt was going to be approx $6, where as four shirts cost approx $8.50. Delivery was as advertised."
273515,0,"While it is hard to tell from the picture these are some big goggles and I cannot recommend them for those who do not wear glasses unless you want to cover the top half of your face. For anyone looking specifically for an OTG option, these make a fine choice. I wear a fairly wide frame and these goggles had no trouble fitting over them easily. The fit is comfortable and easy to adjust as needed. The rear buckle is a bonus for those who wear helmets. My only hesitation for providing a full 5-star recommendation is that they will fog up if air is not actively moving through them. This can be an issue while standing in line to get on the ski lift, waiting for the kids to get out of ski school, or laying around on the slope after a spill. It doesn't take much air movement to clear the fog out, maybe 5mph of breeze, but when the wind is at a standstill and you are too, the only thing you will want to do is take the goggles off so you can see what&#8217;s going on."

103558,1,"This is the second Topeak pump (portable pump for bike) that I have purchased and both have fit expectations. The floor pump was longer than expected but was manageable. I have used the pump for various inflations (bike, farm trailer, tiller) and it has work very well. I have check the mounted guage against a digital guage and it is fairly accurate within usually 3 pounds. The locking knob works well and releases without lost of much air. The only improvement would be a better base since the plastic feels a little thin. Price was a positive factor and I would purchase it again."

The whole purpose for ordering purple was to match a team uniform. Although the UA tag had a purple strip to indicate the shirt was purple, it was not. I'm guessing it was a factory second because of the color. I will choose another vendor -- UA directly -- to ensure I receive the color I expect."

239528,0,"As with many other archery products sold online (here and elsewhere) the description has absolutely no useful information to help you guess whether the product is what you need. The picture of the product doesn't help much either. So this is not so much a review but a completion of the information that SHOULD have been provided when this product was listed for sale. To be fair, the product number 68300 cannot even be found on the allencompany.net manufacturer's web site, but that doesn't make ordering something that WON'T WORK any less aggravating.These nocks are for solid arrows, usually made of wood, that have a nock taper on the tail end. They will NOT fit on arrows that have a square cut on the end of the arrow shaft like NEARLY ALL arrows currently on the market. There is some information about tools that can be used to cut a taper onto an arrow shaft here: [...]However, it would be a very bad idea to taper any arrow material other than wood, and it would be very difficult to create a useful taper on any kind of hollow arrow shaft in order to mount these nocks.Hope this helps the next person avoid ordering the wrong thing. The quality of this item seems okay, but I'd probably also deduct a few stars from a beta-max tape if it were listed for sale with no more information about its intended use than this product has."

432917,0,"I was looking for a good butane lighter for my cigars, and a friend recommended this one. My first shipment was defective: the fuel feed was uneven, and all of the gas leaked out overnight. I exchanged it for a new one, which works.Pros: It looks impressive from a distance, and it probably won't break if you accidentally sit on it or something.Cons: The wind won't blow it out, but if there's more than the gentlest of breezes the flame will be pathetic, and you won't be able to toast your cigars. Next, the thumb switch heats up extremely quickly, so my fingers are roasting long before I get a good coal going on the cigar. Lastly, this thing drinks fuel; I have to refill it after every third or fourth cigar. I don't see the point of 'survival gear' which requires you to carry two or more cans of butane gas if you're planning on being in the woods more than two or three days.Conclusion: this is probably a fine cigarette lighter, but it's not so good for cigars or campfires."
51819,0,"Wow. Next-generation game. $60. And this is what we end up with?Graphics are good but not great, let alone awesome(play a game in the rain...waaay too choppy for next-gen graphics). Gameplay is ok, but not as smooth, consistent, and fun as past incarnations. It is also missing some options, features, and extras from past NCAA titles(but don't worry, i'm sure they'll offer these bit by bit as downloadable content in the future where you gotta fork over more money as apparently $60 off the rack isn't enough). I'm sure there are EA loyalists/apologists who think i'm a hater(it's true, i hate EA so much i've bought most of their NCAA football titles for the past decade or so including their first on the Sega Genesis way back when, and my favorite incarnation of them all: NCAA 2004 with coverboy Carson Palmer on the Gamecube!).But anyway, is this a terrible game? Not really. if you can 'overlook' and 'forgive', it's good enough graphics and gameplay-wise. But if you used up all your 'look the other way/turn the other cheek' mentality with the also-disappointing(but better-looking at least) MADDEN 2006 on 360; then i STRONGLY recommend you rent this game first or read better and more detailed reviews on the game before buying it. I wish i had before i bought this game. Then at least my lowered expectations wouldn't have set me up for such a huge let-down. Recommended only as a rental or 'read reviews first before buying'. Seriously, after MADDEN 2006, i thought EA learned that next-gen games(at next-gen prices i might add), needed to have everything last-gen games had and more. With NCAA 2007, i guess not. Perhaps NCAA 2008 will be the game we're all hoping for. Hope MADDEN 2007 at least addresses all the concerns of its previous incarnation on 360.Btw, can others tell me:how do you change the camera angle?how do you set up a demo game to watch cpu vs cpu?where's the slick front end and in-between-game presentations?why do the graphics sometimes slow down, seem choppy, etc?how do you create-a-school?where's the sports-illustrated covers?Maybe many of these are unlockables or rewards for achievements-earned during gameplay and hopefully NOT extra-cost downloadables. But hey, the EA execs gotta eat don't they? But not to worry, NCAA 2007 will sell by the truckload cause the majority rules. And in this day and age, the majority says ""we'll take hd graphics over features and gameplay anyday"". The majority has spoken."
453741,1,all i can say is WOW. i got this for my wife and chose it base on the price. i was septical at first but this turned out to be one of the best riding bikes we have had the pleasure to own. this bike went together very easily. The shimano 105 drive trail is Very high quality and works perfectly. the paint finish is amazing for the price. my bike weighs less than 19lbs. the ride is supper smooth. don't let the car name fool you. THIS IS A GREAT BIKE and i would reccommend it to anyone! GO GET ONE BEFORE THEY SELL OUT!
364596,1,"Came ahead of the estimated date. Although the picture here on Amazon can be a bit decieving, it was much smaller than anticipated. It is about as big as those hard cover glasses cases that they have at Costco. But with all the wires coming out of the handlebar area of my bike, I'm happy it didn't come too large. It definitely won't hold a regular wallet but is great for small tools and other little things. Quality was great as well."

253058,2,"I bought this for use in a camper van for snow trips. Supposedly safe for use indoors, but it set off my carbon monoxide detector after about an hour. I'm not comfortable at all using this inside. It would be a decent foot-warmer for off-season patio occasions though.If you get a catalytic heater like this, get a CO detector so you don't wake up dead.It's also larger than I thought-- the element is about 8 inches across. It's hard to tell from the picture, but that might matter to you if you plan on traveling with it.Running the first bottle of fuel through it outside got rid of the first-time fire-up smell.The build quality is rather poor. I had to remove the chrome ring and re-seat the element because it was not aligned with the chassis properly. The propane bottle presses against the plastic body."

This is a terrible gun for regular airsoft, you need to be close quarters for a guy to even feel it. it goes about 50 feet, not very accurate. The low capacity mag is great but runs out quick, the high capacity mag is great, it looks really cool, haven't had to recharge it yet, and after you get this I strongly reccomend upgrading the ROF and FPS on it. I wouldn't get this if you don't have another gun, OK sidearm."
349910,2,"There have already been some excellent and extensive reviews, so I have little to add. Although this tool is solidly constructed, I find it too bulky to carry, yet not bulky enough to alow the screwdrivers to be easily pried out. The saw is rather useless (another blade should be included), and while the scissors seemed strong, the weld holding the spring to the blade broke without extensive or intensive use. I consider these major flaws and would not recommend purchase--unless the price falls below $20."

510437,1,"I like this item especially if it has the complete information. Very portable airbed. No need to find a power outlet and not even to worry if brought to another country with 220V power since it is battery-powered. I like the texture of the top part of this bed since it holds the queen size fitted-sheet very well. This keeps the sheet from slipping. Pump works fine and needed four Size D battery. It has two size of adaptor that I even used it on a floating items for the pool. It can inflate the bed and floating items but it can be used to deflate the same items when you need to fold and keep them back in the closet. Absolutely, no air left on the bed or floating devices after using the pump for deflation. It has complete instruction. The downsides are: 1> the item does not indicate if how much weight it can carry. I weigh 152 lbs., my wife weighs 122 lbs., and it did not blow up. My daughter weighing 74 lbs, joined us and it was still able to hold. But when my daughter got off from the bed and my 94-lbs. son took her place, a needle-size hole was made. 2>the other downside, this item does not include extra patches that we can use to seal after it got a needle-size hole. I used patch for tire tube of my mountain bike to seal it and it worked great."

129376,0,"I originally thought that the Topeak RedLite UFO would be a great addition to my extremely well made Topeak MX trunk bag and rear-rack system. Alas, I'm pretty disappointed with the RedLite UFO overall, especially given its relatively high cost.The idea -- a clippable tail light that would emit 180-degrees of marker illumination -- seemed great, particularly since the light was designed to clip onto the very sort of Topeak trunk bag I owned.Unfortunately the red LEDs in the RedLite UFO, not very bright to begin with, radiate in a very limited vertical axis. This means that, unless the light happens to be vertically oriented at exactly the right angle, most people driving cars won't see the light at its brightest. Too bad then that maintaining a particular vertical orientation is essentially impossible when the light is clipped onto the fabric of a trunk bag...Note too that the placement and ludicrously low intensity of the light's yellow LEDs makes them essentially useless as marker lights. The yellow LEDs do virtually nothing beyond providing rather superfluous illumnation of the light's control button.In the end, my new RedLite UFO compares extremely poorly with the Cateye TL-LD 1000 I also own. Given that both lights are premium priced, I'd suggest you do some comparison shopping if you're looking for bright, horizontally and vertically wide-angled marker illumination for your bike."

459785,0,"I read about these in the book ""Run for Life."" The author swears they helped him get through the Boston Marathon. Testimonials on the website make them sound magical. People reported running without pain or injury just from holding the grips. They report increased speed. So I was intrigued. I use them for running and here's the deal. They make you very aware of your hand position and arm swing. That's useful because some believe that proper arm swing aids proper running form and improper arm swing hinders it. I don't know if that's true but, assuming the body is connected that way, the grips keep you aware of the right way to hold your hands and swing your arms for maximum efficiency. You could probably get the same result with two handles from ski poles. The trick is keeping the awareness when you don't run with the grips. If you have about $40 to spare and are a gadget geek or a running form maven, go ahead. But they're not essential by any measure."

31841,0,Initial review after two uses is the gloves seem very sturdy and the sizing is slightly snug for a large even though that's the recommended size for my hand. The only issue I have is I should have purchased a 3/4ths finger length glove instead as personally I prefer more coverage. These only extend halfway up the length of the hand and slight parts still aren't protected (purely preference as I am used to a 3/4th length).
144420,1,"The smell of this reminds me of the oil I used to use on my trumpet back in high school. I sprayed some on some old gloves and the next day put them on and stuck my hands under the kitchen faucet ... except for the parts that were knit and not nylon (or whatever material they're made out of) my hands were dry as a bone... still smelled a little like the spray though. After spraying those gloves down I took my almost full 22oz bottle of this stuff to task on my tent. Let me tell you I doped thatTexsport Camouflage Trail Tentup with enough water proofing spray to coat it to ""wet"" twice over. Let it dry (had to bring it indoors since I live in an apartment complex and didnt want it to get stolen over night) and while I didnt test its water resistance Im sure it'll be water proof after using this spray on it. I rolled the tent up and stuck it back in my pack and put my pack in my trunk. Now should I ever get stuck out in the wilderness Ive got a camo waterproof tent :). And Ive still got almost 25% of the bottle left! I will definitely be buying this again!One word of caution though... it IS teflon (the slipperiest substance known to man) so dont get any on linoleum or carpet or hardwood because you will fall on your backside when you slip on it the next day. It will hurt and you will have to explain to everyone at work why youre limping."

138543,2,"A Super idea - here's a way to cut a limb that is too high to climb to and/or too thick to use your pruning saw on.That's about as far as it goes - the way it's *supposed* to work.Unfortunately, there are several problems actually making the concept work:Getting the saw up there - yep, there is the ""throwing bag"" - which if you have a good, accurate arm and handle the loose rope well - will get the saw over the branch. However, if your aim isn't so good, or if there are several branches in the way, or too many twigs, etc - it can take several (many) tries to get this to work.Another user mention that the device for ""flipping"" the blade right-side-up is iffy at best. This is especially true (again) if there are twigs near where you want to cut that prevent the blade weight from flipping the blade.Anybody who's cut branches off of trees knows that occasionally a saw blade gets ""pinched"" and stuck. That's a big pain on the ground - but when it happens with this tool, the stuck saw blade is up to 25' overhead. Whatcha gonna do now? If you're lucky enough to have the branch sawed through enough that it's started to come down, you can grab it and pull and bounce on it and it will probably break free bringing the saw back to earth. Another user mentioned that his chain broke when this happened. If the branch won't break off - then you either have to climb anyway (if you even can) or - you get to leave your expensive saw UP in the tree and you're worse off than you started.Finally, anybody who knows about pruning limbs off of trees that you want to keep knows that it takes THREE cuts to do this properly - and that one of them needs to be made from bottom of the branch to keep the bark from tearing. That's just impossible with this tool. So resign yourself to a very messy, unprofessional job.So - buy this tool if you're OUT of other options - and resign yourself to the fact that you may STILL have to climb to finish the job and get your saw back down. I have used this tool to make 5 or 6 cuts - but every one of them had problems, and only one of them looks like a decent pruning job. The rest look like an amateur did it. I still had to climb for most of those cuts."

49190,0,"I've had a hard time using the Hit-A-Way as the Velcro straps are designed to be used with narrow diameter poles (maybe 5"" or less). As the particular pole we have at our home is closer to 8"" across (it holds up the roof shading our car) the Velcro barely overlaps. This in turn makes the product potentially dangerous as every half dozen whacks the straps need to be tightened.If we had a smaller pole, the Hit-A-Way would work fine. It's basically playing tetherball with a bat and a (much) smaller ball on the end of the rope."
485578,0,Has strong weight capacity. Basically a bucket with handle inside a brown larger bucket that acts as a seat. Brown outter container should be made with a standard bucket handle but it doesn't so get really comfortable carrying it with two hands like a pan of cookies. Would have rated higher if had a proper handle.

475918,0,"The duffle bag looked like the photo, but it was a little lighter weight than I had hoped. The zipper arrangement on top is in a square pattern, which makes retrieving items a bit cumbersome since the bag doesn't open up totally. It will probably work better when items are just stuffed in and pulled out at random."
133458,1,"I can't wait for the first frost or light dusting of snow. This jacket is fantastic! The fleece liner pops out for those cool fall days and zips back into the vertex shell for rainy or wet days. This coat is 2 great coats in 1! With lots of pockets you can safely store your wallet, cell phone or anything else you need and not worry about losing it on the slopes."

365625,2,I'm usually a Med so I got a Lg to make sure they were cozy as I wanted them for just wearing at home.I am returning the Lg and getting the XL only b/c I wanted cotton and they are fairly well priced.the sizing is VERY off though. go up at least 2 sizes ladies if you are planning on buying them.
165953,1,"I have an old red Swiss Army knife that I cannot find anywhere that is almost identical to this one, but has a couple of extra tools including an adorable ruler. (for any of you men reading this, sorry, I meant USEFUL) It is a tiny bit heavier than this new one but considering the extra tools is well worth it. But I am satisfied with the new one as it has the main thing I wanted, the scissors, which are fantastic! You would never think something so tiny could be so strong. I have also used the tweezer a few times on my old one and again, it is so tiny but works great. While I haven't actually used this new one yet, the quality seems to not have diminished from my original one...like I said it seems exactly the same except for the reduced number of tools."
395850,1,"If you have asiatic facial features, where the nasal bridge and eyes appear flatter and less 3-dimensional than caucasian or african facial features, these are great goggles to have. Most 2-lens goggles seem to be designed for faces with the deeper-set eyes and more prominent nasal bones. The problem with most 2-lens goggles, even Speedos, is that you can't try them on until they come out of the package, and once they've been on your face, you really can't return them. There was only one model of Speedos that ever fit me, and it was always hit-or-miss if new ones that I bought in stores were the same models. These 1-lens goggles are great - they just fit right over the upper half of your face and stay on without discomfort (allowing for the normal discomfort you start to experience after you've had any type of goggles tightly on your skin for any length of time). And they remain clearer and less foggy than most 2-lens goggles, too. Bottom line, they're great and worth the money."
459617,1,"Have had it for about 3 weeks. Good quality heavy plastic, cards are dealt smoothly. The roller weight keeps the cards at the right angle for a smooth operation."
186276,0,"I'll preface this by heartily admitting what a cheap stingy (insert word of choice here) I am. This was the cheapest item of the type so naturally, I went with it.I was kind of hovering around 2 stars because of the lack of instructions, which were vague. The price kept it from being a 1 star right off the bat. There was neither explanation nor apology for the differently sized bolts/holes and the height adjustment.It seems to me that the differences in bolt/hole size was deliberate. The different length bolts also have different diameters. In short, the wrong bolts simply will not fit in the wrong holes, so add 1 star. It took me an hour to figure that out, so take that star back. This is coming from a guy who doesn't read instructions anyway, so take it or leave it.The height adjustment made sure it fit pretty well on my bike. Here we are at 3 stars if you're counting. I ride an older model 27"" Raleigh racing bike, by the way. I am also using a milk crate tied down with bungees, which is probably an unintended use anyway, so no change in rating here.It seems to be reasonably sturdy, but I'm not figuring that in my rating since I've only had it for a month. Final result: 3 stars for good fit at good price but lacking instructions and difficulty in assembly."

166459,1,"I bought this mask as soon as it hit the market. Actually, before it hit the market. I placed my order before it was even availible for shipment. Anyway, the mask is worth every penny. I paid considerably more than you can buy the mask today. I officiate high school and college ball, and I wear this mask with no fear. I have taken several foul balls right in the grill and the mask has performed masterfully. I have owned probably 5 masks in 15 years and this has been my favorite, hands down. All of the former models were top of the line products as well. The Wilson Dyna-Lite, The Wilson Zero Gravity, The +Pos composite, all masks in the $100.00 range. No better than this trusty little Diamond mask at almost half the price. Buy the mask, save the money, and you will be yet another satisfied customer."
482877,2,I had a non coated Leek that I broke the tip off on. I wanted to replace it. I received the first one and it would not even fully open. I tried about 20 times and it just did not get much better. My old one flicked out with authority. The replacement one was just as bad. I even tried to oil it to see if that would help. Maybe I got a bad batch? I never bothered with a third.
491205,2,"As others have noted, these are very cheap. One of the new ones I received had threads not molded correctly on the cap, so it won't seal. I expect the other will end up failing over time.These are cheap pieces of garbage and would not suggest anyone purchase them.I will also have to remind myself to read reviews prior to purchase."
79938,0,"Once installed, the rack is great and very functional. I had trouble installing it on my older model Univega. I needed to drill out the holes on the support bars to make them big enough to fit with my seat post bolt. Not that difficult to do, but i definitely would prefer an install that didn't require me to modify the product."

108707,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
630,0,I like the fact that the pump is built in. I don't like that it tends to lose air over night. It does not go flat but it a lot softer.
180229,1,"I recently purchased this snorkel for my 1-week trip to Maui. I snorkeled every day of the week, and everything went very well. Really liked the big-ness of the actual goggles themselves. Also, the pink snorkel made it easy for other members of my group to keep track of where I was above water, which is important especially if you plan to snorkel way out from the beach! However, this snorkel features the ability to blow out air through your nose, and because of that then it makes for goggles that can fog pretty easily. I tried using sea drops, which only worked marginally well. Funny enough, plain old spit seemed to work even better."

7431,2,"I was searching for a low density foam roller to help with my IT bands, and hamstrings. When I got the roller, it was very stiff and very hard, like a high density foam roller. I didn't return it, didn't want to have to pay for shipping - twice... so there it sits in the corner of the work out room :( If you want a rock hard roller, this is what you want... but it's way too hard for me and it's more pain than working out the kinks."
154374,1,"Wonderful cooker for general use. Can be used both on the stove and in the oven, and cleans up quickly and easily. Only drawback is that it is a little too small for group cooking. One quart larger (although making the pot heavier) would be ideal."

85334,1,"We purchased this bag to try winter camping for the first time. We were scared without a good sleeping bag that we would have a bad experience and never want to try winter camping again. We went for the weekend, 2 nights up north in 10-30 degree weather in a tent in the snow. First night the bag performed well and kept both of us toasty and warm. Second night the temp dropped and we were both slightly chilled, but still comfortable. I would not suggest sleeping outside in less than 10 degrees with this sleeping bag. The inner lining of the sleeping bag was comfortable. The sleeping bad was difficult packing into its storage bag and was big and bulky once in. Overall the bag performed well and did what it was purchased for. If interested in winter camping make sure you know what you are doing, if I hadn't gotten essentials such as this sleeping bag, sleeping pads, moisture barriers, wool blankets, it could have easily became a horrific experience for the two of us.Pros: warm, comfortable, natural colors, tough material, longer bag for additional room, and all around zippersCons: big and bulky, hard to pack into storage bag, noisy external material if restless sleeperOverall: worked excellent and made my first winter camping trip enjoyable"

409989,0,"If yoga, Tai chi, Pilates and exercise balls didn't exist this would get 4 stars. First off if your not an Amazon Prime member don't purchase this getting Super Saver Shipping. It will bearly get to you with out falling through it's packaged box and it will lightly or more damage anything it is packeaged with. Especially the 10 pounder. If you have Amazon Prime this is a far smarter buy. Either way you will save a little or more buying this assuming it's purchased instead of higher quality more expensive medicine balls. Are the higher quality ones really any better? Some a little but none a ton. Part of what you may get out of the higher quality balls are better manufacturer warranties and supports not as much as ball quality. The quality of the ball is a little lower quality then certain other medicine balls however nothing incredibly different. And believe me with my quality obsession I would know if it was! It will save you a little money getting this to if it's the ideal weight that you need. Especially if you are a frequent prime customer!"

I've used this bag in field conditions down to about 20 degrees and I was cold. I lived, but had to layer up with some fleece. Its very durable, Ive slept in it approximatly 180 days and put it through hell and so far no rips or significant signs of wear. It is a pain in the neck to get back into its carrier even though I do it weekly."

339492,1,"I especially like the extra little clip. I clip it onto a belt loop or to the seam on the inside of a pocket, if I don't have belt loops. It has kept my pedometer from falling off my waistband onto the floor or into the toilet many times."

I have used these about 10 times sofar, each time it has remained snug, keeping my muscles warm. Washing them has not lessened their quality.Pros:- Remain snug the entire time wearing them keeping the muscles warm- Does not stretch out, high quality- Holds up fine in the washCons:- Only thing really is there a bit pricier than other options but they are worth itI would definitely get these again, and have actually been looking around to get another."
245130,1,"I bought two of these to use as ""work shirts"" when working outside when it's too cold out for a t-shirt, but not cold enough to use a coat when working up a sweat. They are good quality, thick enough to be warm, but not so thick that they ""don't breathe"". For the price, especially since these will be something that gets dirty pretty fast in my usage, it's a steal.I'm a fairly big guy of average height, and I found the XXL sizing to be spot on for me and for my intended usage. Other folks of different proportions or intended usage may have a different view of the sizing. I wanted the shirts somewhat oversize for ease of mobility and better breathing when working up a sweat, without being too baggy and being in the way."

250485,0,Received 3-burner stove and the propane connector was damaged. Looked like it was dropped and cardboard (only protection) was torn.

321813,1,My niece loved the shirt. It was unlike anything she had seen in stores. Thanks.Great service too.
352748,1,"These shorts are exactly what I expected. They compress my legs very well, and don't slide around. The waistband is quite comfortable, and doesn't sit too high. These shorts are obviously intended to be work under your gym shorts, so if you're looking for running shorts to wear by themselves, these aren't them. That said, they work exceptionally well, and I have had no issues with chafing since I started using these. Definitely worth the price!"
364932,1,Even if you could never see yourself wearing this. Go ahead and get it anyway.This is great for under the football helmet & for under the motorcycle helmet. Feels good on your head.

180894,1,"I ordered this vest, as opposed to the 40 lb. vest also shown. It seemed odd that the 20 lb. vest would cost more than the 40 lb. vest, but I decided that I only really wanted 20 lbs. of weight in the vest, at most, so I paid the higher price. Well, I received the 40 lb. vest anyway. The mailman wasn't too happy with me when he delivered a 40 lb. box to my door. It wouldn't be worth the trouble (or the shipping) to return the vest to get a 20 lb. version, so I'm keeping it and removing a lot of the weight. It's pretty good, well padded, and feels good when I wear it to exercise."

503600,0,"This review is for the gloves usage solely for washing the dishes.I had been avidly looking around for durable gloves to wash the dishes with since the dish washing gloves my mom and I used always tore within the 1st month of usage. I ended up purchasing these gloves and wasn't disappointed. My mom, on the other hand, hated these gloves because it really limited her dexterity and made her fingers sore/hurt after a single usage (she's in her late 50's). For me, I really didn't mind the limited mobility since I thought the trade-off of being able to wash the dishes in scorching hot water was worth it.In my 3 years of so of owning these gloves, my mom herself went through at least 2 dozen or so of the regular dish washing gloves. After the 3rd year though these gloves developed a really disturbing smell that persisted even after machine washing. In addition, the cotton liner hardened around the opening, causing it to scratch and irritate my skin. As a result, I had to throw it away.All in all, I thought this purchase was well worth it in the long run, although I'm not sure if I'd buy again for the sole purpose of washing the dishes since there are other options out there."

108487,0,"I really like my skates, the quality of the shoe itself is great. They fit and feel like a glove. They are sturdy and comfortable. The wheels are fancy and I love the design and color! My only concern is with the bearings which leave a sort of rumbly ride, they seem to not flow freely, and have drag which makes skating more of a chore than fun. They need a higher quality wheel with a more precision bearing. In all fairness this could also be the quality of the floor at the rink where I skate, however I tried rental skates there and the rumbling doesn't happen with the rented skates. Wish shoes came with a more professional wheel bearing!"

84908,0,"Overall, these gloves are good for light training, but after having used them for a while, I think I'm going to have to get some that have more robust padding in the knuckle area. The fit is very good, though as another reviewer notes, they are snug with hand wraps (which I like). The leather is a nice alternative to the vinyl and neoprene common in many bag gloves because it allows your hand to breathe. My only issue is that the padding over the knuckles is thin (1/4 inch foam), and now that it has been beaten down a little, I find I have some soreness even with hand wraps."
356086,0,Lets get one thing straight this is no tactical knife..Way to small the blade is 2.5 inches.I was surprised it was really a G-10 handle all frost tactical knives i seen are cheap plastic that i wouldn't trust for anything but opening a box or something.This is a nice little knife for the price.Not up to a 50 dollar knife like the other reviewer said.But i would through this in my pack or glove box or even carry it in my pocket.I did have to clean and oil it right out of box and blade is cheaper 440 steel but it did come paper cutting sharp.So all in all not bad for the price its a sturdy little knife with G-10 for under 10 bucks..

157264,1,"I live a mile and a half from my office and I have occasionally gotten on my bike and rode it to work. The trouble is that I always felt sore all day even though the ride is not very far. This made me not want to do this very often. I'm at the point in my life where I really need to get some exercise and figured that riding to work would be ideal and would even save some gas money. After searching online for a new bike seat, I settled on this one, based on the other reviews. From first hand experience, I can tell you that this seat has made all the difference in the world. It is very padded and broad and does not have the pointy part that can make a man, shall we say, uncomfortable. I now ride to work often and never have the soreness problem. The seat takes a little getting used to, but once you get over the slight feeling of leaning forward, it is fine. I highly recommend this bike seat. A good product at a good price."

310862,0,"I went to the beach for july 4th and used my shelter. I had used it before, but july 4th reenforced my feelings on the shelter. It is a great shade spot, and if the tempeture outside isnt blazing, it could possibly be the greatest product made to provide shelter. BUT this product CAN NOT be used during mid day times (1-3pm) when the sun is at its hottest. Its basically a cooking pot when used during that time. Ventilation is ok (not good, but OK), which is its downfall. During the mid-day, it honestly felt better outside the shelter then inside because of the breeze (this led me to buy a canopy instead). Can you face the shelter towards the direction of the breeze? Of course, but when you have kids in the water, EVERYONE will face it towards the water. And the breeze doesnt always flow in the direction facing the water. Where I am located, the breeze HARDLY flows in the direction facing the water.Of course the ventilation is its only flaw, but its a MAJOR ASTRONOMICAL flaw where i am located, which is why I gave it 3 and not 4 stars."
310141,0,"This was the first shower room I purchased and I did like it. My only BIG complaint is how hard it is to set up. It probably takes a good 20-30 minutes to get the thing assembled. I've misplaced a few of my connectors, so it's important to hang on to the instructions. A simple floor would be nice, so you don't have to stand in the mud. It won't hold a full shower bag, so be frugal about the water you use inside, unless you want to fill it up halfway thru your shower! I like the windows, although it gets pretty hot inside."
154004,0,"The product itself is good - the quality seems to be OK so far. Positive: Recieved order and shipping information for the shipper (unsolicited updates).

Considering time, weight, and method shipping charge from this comapny was high at $5.25."

It's much more comfortable and sleek. Your ass will thank you."

292472,0,"I have owned both Sigg and Klean Kanteen bottles, and, unlike many other reviewers, I do prefer the Sigg. However, some of this may just be personal preference, so you'll have to decide if my problems will be your problems as well. First and foremost, the Klean Kanteen dents MUCH easier than the Sigg, at least for me. I use my bottle all day, every day, and tend to drink about a gallon of water per day. When the Sigg is dented, it merely dents, while the Klean Kanteen gets little rough patches, which aren't a big deal, but they do catch on things, which is kind of annoying. Secondly, as I said, I drink a lot of water every day, and whilt the wide mouth is good for refilling, it also creates a spillage problem for me. I am kind of messy about it, but I have spilled on myself ten times more from this bottle than with the Sigg. Again, this may just be my personal problem, but it's a bother to me. Finally, the Klean Kanteen doesn't keep the water as cold for as long as the Sigg does. Overall, it's a fine bottle, especially for the price, and if these things don't bother you, go for it, as these are mainly design issues I have and not at all quality issues with the bottle. However, I bought this as a replacement for my Sigg that got stolen last year, and I ended buying a new Sigg and using my Klean Kanteen as a backup. It just wasn't a perfect fit for me."

I love its automatic mechanical movement because there is never a need to worry about batteries in a quartz, it just winds itself with the movement of your wrist or if its been sitting for a couple of days simply wind it with the crown. It came from the shipping company DHL within about two weeks which seemed long but it was free shipping so in the end it was all good, it came in a nice yellow leather feeling case with instruction manual and polishing cloth and watch sitting on a felt holder to keep its shape. If you are shopping for a watch with great quality and a very good price this is the best choice. you won't be disapointed with Invictas products. I am wearing it right now and i just like how pretty it is. Buy it !"

56190,1,"Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XLPro: sturdy; portable; timerCons: squeaky sounds; overheating; useless timerI bought Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL in local store for [...]. It is easy to assemble and easy to use. I used Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL for small workout during long hours of playing video games, watching TV, writing Amazon reviews or blogs, or facebooking. It is quite portable. I can carry it from my bedroom to living room to sundeck, but then again the sundeck is too hot; therefore, I don't want to use it there. Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL grip of the floor/carpet is okay as long as I don't put too much force on pedaling. It may move from time to time especially if I'm having adrenaline rush or whenever I lift it with my hands or some annoying thief. Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL has timer which is cool at first.... However, its timer is useless. I removed it because it is in the way of my pedaling.After 3 years of heavy usage and long duration, Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL is quite sturdy. No repairs or maintenance performed maybe except putting some silicon tapes on the arms of the pedals, because it overheats even if just 10 minutes of using it. As it overheats, it also begin to squeak every pedal. Since I'm watching TV or playing games, squeaky sounds are not that loud.Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL is only good for minimal workout or using it for taking a break after intense cardiovascular exercise."

I love this product and guarantee it will clean your footwear to new condition!"

Not what I was hoping for in a storage container.Have a Bushmaster .223 rifle. The cleaning rod provided in the kit barely fits in the bore. The rod is an extremely tight fit. If you try to use a cleaning pad on the end of the rod, there is no way it fits at all.That having been said, I gave the kit four stars because you do get the solvent, the oil, a brush (that fits), the pad holder, the cleaning rod, and the cleaning pads.

I have a GW300 (module 2608) that had one of the early batteries so notorious for failing. This (GW700) watch just seems to go in the wrong direction. It's not as good looking, as tasteful, whatever. The digits are harder to read. The layout of the display makes less sense. Now with time on my hands (no pun intended) and with nothing to lose, I ordered a battery for the GW300 and carefully changed it. Guess which one I'm wearing and guess which one is in the cupboard in standby mode? If I had it to do over again, I would simply look at the pictures of the many watches Casio offers and try to be more careful."

321958,2,"Out of the box this watch looks and feels great. However, the zero setting, too often required, is painfully methodical, the mode change easily switches as the protruding bezel often touches my wrist and, as a result, the perpetual calendar, alarm, and chronograph are accidentally altered! After having reset the perpetual calendar for the fifth time for some reason, the date is perpetually crooked! I would not recommend this watch and am surprised by the great reviews. My assumption is that many of these reviews were written during the first week or two."

489021,0,"the SSI bore sighter was purchased with excitement and the illusion of 21 st century high tech simplifying the time consumming and painfull art of sighting a shotgun. If it had been a race for survival the old timers would have won. We spend days believing in the accuracy of a laser gadget over our common sense until we realized that the gadget gave us a diferent reading when we simply rotated it in the gun barrel. Two inches at 25-ft becomes completely out of the target area at 50 yards. I have not spoken to the manufacturers because, honestly, I think that the name 'bore sighter' may mean that you ultimately get 'bored' with it and know better than to ask a question to which I already know the answer. All in all the bore sighter is usefull in impressing those who are unaware of the gadgets existance ('wow you are so clever!'), but get a smile and a quiet node from the savvy ones that also bought it and don't use it anymore. However, I do give credit to the gadget for raising my awareness about gun and barrel accuracy. I would dare recommend to the manufacturer that it would not be a big deal to machine cut a small tool to center the darn little laser emitter in the gadget's case to facilitate its own calibration. Such a tool should be included as standard equipment."

391301,2,"This device is Exhibit A in the trend to sell us devices that suffer from Feature Bloat, the piling on of features that nobody (or very few people) need and which get in the way of your using the device for what it was primarily intended. Feature Bloat is so widespread and counterproductive that I feel the need to issue a public protest. I would pay extra to have fewer features, in this case removing such marginal capacities as dual time zone, repeat cycle, recover mode, split timing and split heart rate recording, alerts for low or high limits exceeded, and dozens more. I challenge anyone to show me a user who actually needs and will use such features. They look good in the ads since they suggest you are getting a ""better"" product, but they are a serious nuisance.You might think; if you don't want those features don't use them. But sadly it doesn't work that way. Every time you touch a button, even by accident, you are in the midst one of those ""features"", like it or not, and unless you remember the relevant instructions you may never get out of that feature. Take, for example the ""hourly chime"" and the ""button beep"". This is how you are told you use them (see Guide page 13). First you are told this, ""Hourly chime: Press Start/Split or Heart rate to toggle between turning the chime on or off"". And then you are told this, ""Button Beep: Press Start/Split or Heart rate to toggle between turning the button beep on or off"". See a difference? And how about the other occasions where you might press those buttons under the mistaken impression that they have something to do with ""heart rate"", as it says on the label? And once you have toggled one of these for any reason, you are stuck with a watch that will beep when you don't want it to beep, such as whenever you press any button at all (this really neat ""feature"" is called ""button Beep""!). The only way to avoid this is to remember the instructions of which there are literally dozens. A friend of mine accidentally put his Timex (different model) into some arbitrary beep mode so it kept going off in theaters or other public places. He got so frustrated pressing buttons trying to stop it that he eventually put the watch away. Sometimes it is not worth the trouble of reading a 40 page manual which describes features in which you have absolutely no interest and which in the end is unhelpful (as in the instructions I quoted above). But the irritating thing is that you NEED to know about those many other uses of some button in order to shield yourself from the device's silly and arbitrary behavior.Here is what I want Timex to sell me. (1) I want a watch which tells time and date. This will involve some complexity, I admit, since you do have to set it occasionally. But it is manageable. (2) I want a watch with one button that changes it (or adds another window in the display) to display my heart rate - not yesterday's heart rate, or a split rate or whatever other potentially useful numbers it could display and which the designer is dying to show you that he knows how to do it. If I wanted such features I would not buy a ""watch-with-HR-and-a-dozen-other-features"". I would buy a medical grade heart rate timer and a good watch. It's not a question of being too lazy to read the instruction book (I'm in the computer field and know how to read manuals - I am also acquainted with user interface issues). It's having better things to do with my time and not enjoying being FORCED to study the entire manual in order to use the device's most rudimentary features. Down with Feature Bloat!"

I am not sure that I would have bought it otherwise, it is similar to phone circa 2006 in screen size and functionality.

320842,0,"Holster is of fine construction and heavy duty. I use it for my G19 and it snaps on and off very quickly. The gripe I have is it is VERY tight. So tight that even adjusting the screw to the loosest possible position will produce a situation where you CANNOT draw the weapon. After tireless hours of breaking it in, I'm finally at the point it will draw, but only if I use my left hand to hold the holster while I draw with my right. I expect that after more use it may be acceptable, but for now it is not."

342463,1,"After sending back the North Face Triple C down jacket because it was too thin and cost over $300, I decided to give this one a try. It's perfect. I wanted warmth without too much bulk, and this fits the bill. I love the (removable) fur hood. The fleecy liner, including in the pockets, is incredibly soft. I'm 5'7 and 130 lbs and it fits perfectly. It covers me down to the bottom of my knees, and I just feel enveloped in luxurious warmth and softness. I might even enjoy this winter in New England! (Well, probably not, but it won't be for lack of warmth thanks to this fabulous coat.)"
231890,0,"This valance is ok. The colors are accurate, it has more of a shiny/silky look to it. Fits the window well."

27175,1,"I got this only because I was looking for a good narrow mouth bottle that can handle a beating. I think this should last quite a few years, because it is incredibly durable. It's inexpensive, holds a lot, and actually allows you to drink and walk at the same time. This is a great value for a water bottle, plus it's BPA free. I use it every day, and for many to come."
110345,1,"Long lasting, perfect for practice and does what it needs to. It came super deflated in a package that would have fit it inflated, but I'm sure there is a reason for that. Great ball."
233571,1,I ride farm roads and carry pepper spray (PepperShot) for the dogs (primarily). I wanted a secure method to attach the 4oz. spray bottle where I can get to it quickly (one dog is REALLY fast). Using the pump strap I attach the spray to the stem which allows me to react faster than any other solution.
312901,0,"I purchased this pack frame for my wife since I have owned one of the early Kelty pack frames for 30 years. It has no sturnum strap to hold shoulder straps together. It needs lots more drilled holes for pin adjustments of various components. The webbing is B quality. That said, it is fairly light - weighing in at 3 lbs. 6 oz. and the welding of aluminum tubing is very good. It also has optional hangers both high and low for the shelf - or the shelf can be removed easily via the pin system. It will probably hold up OK for moderate use."
221727,0,"A basic kickstand, lighter than most of what I've found at Big Box stores. It does its job. Only area I'd like to see improved is some sort of rubberized liner or coating for the inner sides of the 'clamp' mechanism - would give me a bit more reassurance that it won't come loose when I kick it up. Nothing some plastic dip or cut down rubber won't take care of, though."
449725,0,the Hanes products seem to run a little small in size. If you wear a 3x you should buy a 4x to be comfortable
288879,1,Delivered on time. Have not had to use it yet but it fits well on the bike. I like the little step-on appendage; I think it will make it easier to pump than holding it with both hands. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I haven't used it yet.
144462,2,"Before ordering, we looked up the measurements on the Stearns website, so we could be sure to order the correct size. This arrived and is being returned on Monday at first UPS pickup. The size is NOT correct. XL is stated to fit up to a 48"" chest on Stearns website (Amazon, inconveniently, does NOT provide ANY sizing info), but this does NOT fit that way. FAR too small. It looked like my husband was trying to wear a child's life vest when he tried this on - it rode up way too high around him on all sides, and while it did close in front, it just looked too small. He also said it just didn't feel right - the ""riding up"" all around meant that the shoulders didn't rest properly on his shoulders. This is NOT the insecure feeling you want when you're swimming in Lake Michigan, esp. if there are one to three foot waves! We are not water testing this - we got it last night, and it's already packed up to be picked up for return on Monday.Amazon, please start providing sizing info (that you verify yourselves...don't just go by manufacturer's stated measurements) so that your customers can buy with more confidence!I am still giving this two stars, though, because the quality SEEMS to be good (nice padding, good shoulder webbing, etc.) If only the sizing info were provided accurately (or at ALL...Amazon, I'm talking to YOU here).I recommend buying this in store, in person, AFTER trying on. Do NOT buy this via mail or online order...you'll likely be disappointed.OTOH, the Body Glove life jacket that we ordered DOES fit correctly, just as per the stated measurements. We're keeping that one. So it's down to the usual: some things are better bought in person, after personally trying on, than others. This life jacket is one of those items."
477469,0,"My friend bought one of these a while ago. We decided to work out on this rather than going to the gym everyday. IMO, free weights are the best way to work out. Next would be a machine with weights and pulleys. The bowflex does work you out, but it does not feel as good as free weights. Yes, the bowflex can get challenging, and the resistance can be really great. However, the feel of each rep does not replicate that of free weights. Rods and bands never feel the same as dead weight. In the long run, I could not get from the bowflex what I get from the gym. That is, the soreness but sureness that I was getting a great workout."
122799,0,"Good knife, one of my favorite manufactures."
462026,1,"I love this wagon. It's like the real, original one that I had as a kid. It's metal and sturdy unlike the plastic wagons so many people use these days. My son has used this for years and it still looks like it will hold up for the next twenty years. You just can't beat a well-built toy made out of metal. Kids know the difference too between this and plastic junk. Compared to a plastic version the price on this is very good. I'd recommend this wagon to anyone."
120224,1,"I bought these to replace a pair of Cabelas brand shears. Those shears did not come apart and the pivot nut kept coming lose, making it difficult to cut off the wings and feet of the birds we shoot.Right away I was impressed with these shears. We just went through cleaning 41 pheasants last week, cutting off wings, legs & heads, then cutting out the backbone, and we had absolutely no problems. These shears made quick work of the job of cleaning the birds so we could get on with enjoying the rest of the evening. I highly recommend them."
475509,0,I would have liked the product review to state that it can not be used with a DC plug in adapter. The back light in my opinion is useless. The Celsius toFahrenheit switch works only part time. The compass works well when it can beseen in the daytime. The instruction sheet should have been written by someone whohas a good working knowledge of the English language.
208910,2,Cant figure out if scope works well or not. The included mounting rings come loose after every shot I fire out of my mosin nagant. If they intend for this to be used on lighter weight guns then they need to include that in the description and not lead people on.
174430,1,"Well, it is well made gun, very accurate, shoots pellets, not BBs. (That is why it is accurate.Nice trigger, easy to load pellets and CO2.Can not comment much on reliability since I am not using it long enough.It is made in Spain, when most of other Air guns are China made..."
321664,2,"My son (teenager) saved his money to buy this gun. Upon receipt, the ammo clip was broken. He tried to contact the company. Finally he received an electric charger. We have no clue as to why. He contacted them again, no response. I contacted then twice, no response.To not return consumers emails is RUDE and a poor business practice. But to take peoples money for faulty items is theft.We will not be doing business again with this company."

211611,1,"I took over a year of Pilates classes (on equipment) with a private instructor, and although, granted, this isn't as sturdy or solid as a ""real"" Pilates Reformer, it's still a valuable piece of workout equipment and as close to Pilates Reformer as you can get without paying $45-60 an hour.(Before any Pilates instructors - whom I respect - get all up in arms about that statement, let me just say that I definitely wish I had the budget to continue paying for an instructor, because it is worth it - but if you don't have the budget, this is the next best thing.)I'd recommend that if you're going to buy one, you take at least a few Pilates Reformer in-person classes first - the accompanying DVD is a bit pithy compared to ""real"" Pilates - but if you know what you're doing regarding Pilates positions, you can definitely make use of the Performer.I've had mine for about 3 months, and although the two plastic covers on each far end do occasionally pop off (you assemble much of the machine yourself - not difficult - and those particular pieces are only attached with double-stick tape), the rest of it seems pretty sturdy given the price. I do not have mine up on a stand, and I prefer it that way, as I can tip it on its side, easily fold it, and slide it underneath the stairs at my flat. It IS quite heavy, but I only noticed that while taking it out of the box; once you dedicate a space for storing it, it can quickly be folded/unfolded and slid into/out of wherever you choose to keep it.Performance-wise (no pun intended), I can do the majority of my previous Reformer routine on this machine, including The Hundred, Mermaid, Arm and Leg Circles, and Elephant, and I'm definitely feeling it in the muscles and seeing results.I'd recommend it for several reasons - if you wish to seriously pursue Pilates but can't afford private instruction (although, again, learning before you use it will benefit you greatly) - or if there isn't a worthy Pilates Studio in your area. I've also noticed that having the equipment right in my flat encourages me to do Pilates 3x a week instead of the 1 session weekly I was doing before, when I went to an actual Pilates studio.Good luck! :)"
215697,0,"Turned out to be too small and is not a ""universal fit."" If you have thick hair or a larger than average head then this might not be the right helmet for you."
75585,1,After many years still going strong. Can pack MSR Stove inside. Lid works well as plate for solo trips
258593,1,"Bore snakes are wonderful. You can use them at the range if you want to stay a long time, out in the field as a quick clean for a battle rifle... the uses are nearly endless.The only maintenance required for bore snakes is occasional cleaning. You can see when they are dirty by judging the tarnish on the brass bristles. Tossing them in a 'delicates' bag (ask your wife about this) and placing them in the washing machine works very well.However... bore snakes are not intended to be replacements for the usual rod and patch method. For 12 gauge shotguns, use the rod, but buy up some Tampax Original Regular. When you fluff them out, they work perfectly as a patch for thoroughly cleaning a 12 gauge barrel. I found this excellent advice at the 'Box 'o Truth' website, and it turned out to be exactly what I needed for my own shotguns. They clean much more quickly and efficiently compared to regular patches."
399788,0,"did not come in a big plastic container like in picture.Came in two separate clear sealed plastic bags with no labels on them, so you cant really tell if its 5000 or not, but it looks like it should be about 5000.They were also green, not yellow.got here in a few days."

351598,0,"I bought this hoping that I could use it on the back wheel when the bike is on the training stand in the winter. Seems to me I read a review that said it would. Well, about the first thing I read in the instructions is that the head has to be mounted within 18 inches of the wheel magnet so I figured that idea was out the window. I tried mightily but nothing would extend the range far enough to mount the head on the handle bars. So if that is your plan, this won't work.As a workaround I just put the head on the floor next to the back wheel, so at least I can get average speed and distance.Having said that, the unit seems to work well and it looks nice. Come summer, I will just remount the magnet on the front fork and it will be fine."
172161,1,"There is a lot to like about this knife...The drop point blade is razor sharp and perfectly machined. The knife feels solid without being heavy or bulky.The handle and bolster are covered by a textured, slightly rubbery material. They call it Trac-Tec. I call it something that's not likely to slip when my hand is wet.The speed assist opening requires only a slight pressure on the ambidextrous thumbstud to get the blade started. Once that's done the spring takes over and the blade snaps open. Out of the box it was a bit stiffer than my (maybe former favorite) Ken Onion Ricochet. Of course this knife is new and stiff while the other is old and used. After a few drops ofFinish Line DRY Teflon Bicycle Chain Lube, 4-Ounce Drip Squeeze Bottlemade it much smoother.Did I mention the thumbstud was ambidextrous. That means you have one on each side of the blade and can open it, one-handed, with either hand. That's not important until you can't use your right hand and still need to open your knife."

466657,1,"I've carried a small, light Beretta knife for about 10 years. Beretta no longer makes this model knife and I was looking around for a replacement when I came across this little Gerber on Amazon. This Gerber is smaller and lighter than my Beretta and it's well-made. At $10 these little knives are a steal!"

100350,1,"as someone wrote before me a lot of people are making the mistake of using these as just boxing gloves when they are actually suppose to be a replacement to handwraps that go under the boxing gloves. as far as time saving goes they are great, i do mma so i switch between grapping and kickboxing a lot and the hand wraps always slowed me down and these took care of that. i would say they also provide almost, if not the same, amount of protection that handwraps do. although they are a little thicker then regular hand wraps i havent had any problems getting them into my gloves and using them, just a little different feeling to get use to. the only reason i dont give these a 5 is because i havent had them long enough yet to see how durable they are. but if you are looking for an easy fix to hand wraps like i was these are truly great"
497106,0,"It can be a good fighting knife due to the double edge and the nice handle but I will not use it as my survial or all-rounded knife, since you can not split woods by hammering the back of the blade (like you can do with Kabar single blade knifes). also the pouch on the sheath is too loose because the velco is too long, causing small belongings come out to get lost.I returned mine, and purchased Kabar extream fighting knife which serves my needs much better."
496546,1,"The Gerber folding shovel is really top notch. Its quality construction is much like any other Gerber/Fiskars equipment I've owned - it doesn't disappoint.The shovel I have is actually a little more agressively pointed than in the pictures, so I'm not sure if Gerber has addressed this as an issue or if the pictures were off.The top of the handle is high density polycarbonate plastic and has a horizontal design like a spade should have. You can still use the verticle part of the steel handle if you wish, but there isn't much of it. The plastic will absorb some shock compared to steel-only, and it won't freeze to your hands, etc. The polycarb handle folds down on itself, so that it actually has 3 segments (instead of several designs which have 2 segments). This means you can stow the shovel in the included cordura nylon belt pouch which is no bigger than the shovel head itself. The handle pivot point locks and since it's square, doesn't rotate or twist easily. The steel which connects the blade to the handle fits nicely inside the A angle cutout of the handle, so when collapsed it is really thin.The blade is high quality steel with the hinged handle connected at the top. This does limit the depth of the shovel a little, but I don't believe it's much of a factor, except maybe in really solid soil where you lose a little verticle travel when the ground butts up against the hinge.It's very compact, light, comes with a solid belt sheath (easily convertible to pack carry) and stows away easily since it's so thin. I can put it in the side pockets of my doors or in the very small space above my rear wheel well without any problems (Trailblazer 4x4).I really can find no fault with this item, it delivers on all fronts: usability, quality, compact storage, and rugged design. I will almost certainly be keeping one in both cars and in my 72 Hour survival kit. They are even reasonably priced. 5 Stars."
344608,0,"I like everything about these pants except for the belt. Most football pants have the belt go all the way around the pants so you can adjust the waist easy, but these ones are stitched on. I had to end of fixing the stitch so my son could even wear them, or else they would keep falling off. Good quality material, but I do not thing I would ever purchase them again because of the belt issue."
290661,1,easy to put on and makes gripping my M85UL easier resulting to better trigger pull. highly recommended!!!
313942,0,"These are very comfortable gi pants. They are a good heavy weight, but soft cotton, not the heavy canvas type, flexible and easy to move in. I've had several different gi pants, and these are, by far my favorite. They are elastic waistband, rather than drawstring, but I prefer that. And as a female martial artist it can be difficult finding gi pants that fit well, but these are definitely the best I've worn.Update to this review: I had decided to purchase another pair of gi pants and ordered these again since I liked them so much the first time. Unfortunately, the gi pants that arrived this time were nothing like the first. The previous pants were brushed cotton, elastic waist. The pants I received the second time were the heavy canvas type material, drawstring waist, and had the ProForce label on the front, exactly what I did not want. I'm guessing the description is intentionally confusing because the pants come from different vendors and Tiger Claw has no idea what may really be shipping? At least I was able to return them without difficulty and was able to find another pair of gi pants elsewhere that fit perfectly. Just be aware when ordering the gi pants may be different than what you expect."
221138,0,"I ordered a size medium for a father's day gift. It turned out to be much larger than the standard polo shirt mediums. But too bad for me, it's not worth returning it and pay for more shipping."
375964,1,"I have this coat in size medium, color is light blue (called ""air"") and it's really cute. First of all, it provides a lot of warmth for being so stream-lined; I think there's somthing to the ""Sherpa Pile"" lining. Also, it does allow enough room through the back and shoulders so I can wear a light to medium weight sweater under it comfortably. Finally, its got a good fitting hood (not too big or small), zippered pockets inside and out and adjustable velcro at the wrist - so it's got some nice finishing touches especially for the price. Highly recommend!"
234889,0,I just wish it charged more than 4 at a time. It takes awhile to charge and they don't seem to keep their charge long. Of course I am comparing it to a regular battery. When you got a bunch of kids toys you need more than 4 to charge at a time.

I'm going to try to contact the company b/c I've been very careful and easy on them."
368568,0,Good and bad for this jacket. First the price is to much. I paid $74.00 but it should have been lower because there is nothing to this jacket. It feels like your wearing a piece of plastic lined with netting. Yes it is waterproof but you better be wearing a flannel shirt underneath or you will freeze.The other good thing i can say about this jacket is the size was perfect. The sleeves are long enough for me as I am 5'8 and it is hard to find a jacket with sleeves long enough.

61876,1,"This bottle does everything it promises and more. The fact that I can leave the bottle flipped open without the danger of a spill makes me sip much more often than from previous screw top ones. Also, no matter how well I thought I'd washed my old bottles (I have no dishwasher), I would always get that mildewy smell at some point. Not so with this one. Get this bottle together with the Culligan faucet filter and you'll never buy water again."

It is the best volleyball made for serious volleyball players. Until two years ago it would have been a 5-star ball but the SV-5WC (color) balls have been hit and miss. Of 12 new balls I had to return 2 due to defects. Tachikara has a great return policy but one ball, after 3 returns, never was quite right.But it's not stopping me from ordering 12 more this season!"

387742,0,"I ordered both the black and white socks. Despite the advertised ratio, which included no polyester, the black ones are labeled having 1% polyester. The white ones were as advertised.The price was so favorable that I didn't send back the black socks. But I can really feel the difference that 1% polyester makes and I would not buy them again. Also, if you take a pair of black socks on one hand, and squeeze, and compare to doing that with the white pair in the other hand, you'll notice a giant difference. The black socks feel like 50% polyester.Both the black and white socks feel pretty thick and warm. The white ones, upon wearing and washing, have shed clumps of material. Higher quality socks cost disproportionally more, I think."
367482,2,"This was great while it lasted. Unfortunately, it didn't last very long. On second use, in moderate winds at Coachella, the plastic parts that hold the poles together snapped.

277065,0,"When I first received this product, I was impressed with it. I froze my water and it stayed cold the entire day (in hot summer weather in Hawaii) and I actually had ice at the end of the day. However, after about a three week daily use, the top portion broke. I contacted the seller and they did a one time offer to replace the holder (for this reason alone I have given them 2 additional stars). For what it's worth and the amount you pay, it's ok.

Don't expect it to keep you warm whatsoever (it has no lining), to keep you completely dry in a hard downpour (although it did keep me dry washing my car), or to give you much protection from the wind (it's extremely thin). On the other hand, if you're just looking for a light jacket to put on when it's drizzling out, this is perfect.The Carbon color is quite nice. It's coloring is identical to theColumbia Sportswear Men's Cougar Peaks Jacket."

366545,0,"It's just a short. Quite mediocre in quality, hence the 3 stars. I didn't have high expectations for this short since I was trying to meet a minimum total for an offer and I would only use it to lounge in. The material is a bit more rough than expected.

I was only half right, I'm a professional mover, I move lots of furniture in a week so I can quickly tell what a watch is made of and this Invicta watch in little time revealed that it's strictly a dress watch.... a show piece and that's all.It does not stand up to much rough treatment, the three big buttons on the side of the watch are not well constructed.The little one on bottom fell off then the big button in the middle when to go look for his little brother and never came back either. Now I'm down to one out of three buttons on the side of the watch. The watch still functions as far as time is concerned but I'm done wearing it. I would recomend this watch however as solely a dress watch.Grace and Peace, God Bless all."
412963,0,"I bought this cooler because of all the great reviews. I was so excited when I got it. I thought it looks great, that's why I gave it a 3 star rating or else it would have been 1 star. I tested it that night I got home. I put bottled water and soda and dumped ice on top. That was around 8PM. By 11PM (3 hours later!), I opened the cooler and ice was halfway melted. There was still ice left. Closed the lid back and left it there and checked on it again the following night when I got home. No more ice, just water! I can't believe other reviewers said that it could keep ice for 3 to 4 days! Mine was just 24 hours inside a 78 degree temp home. Did I just get a bad unit?"

It really does stink. I keep it in my small laundry room and every time I open the door I'm hit with its chemical odor. So if you're going to buy this, know that you can't store it in any room where people live, or any closet where you keep clothes or anything you don't want to pick up a stench.Otherwise it's a fine mat. A bit stretchy, but fine."

The colors are amazing - and on the first day I wore the green one I got compliments from almost everyone I ran into. I skied in it at Breckenridge in sub zero temperatures and it kept me very warm. I just make sure when I wear it I wear something under it that has pockets - ie: A down vest or a hoodie with pockets to keep my phone etc. If running around town it is not as big a deal as I usually have my purse.So as long as you are willing to deal with the no pocket part - it is a really, really cute jacket, very flattering, great colors, and suprisingly warm.

312620,2,"I had Amy Bento's advanced step challenge 3 and enjoyed it, but it got lost in my house so I decided to try another one of her workouts. Step challenge 3 was difficult to learn, but I was able to get through most of the work out on the first try with only a few of the moves taking a few viewings to get down. Step Challenge 4 is a whole different story. Can you say frustrating? She has virtually no call outs, no warm ups into the moves. She starts out as if you've already done the combos 100 times and goes through at warp speed. The previews are of some help, but once you hit the regular program she goes through the moves way to fast. I could see this taking a number of viewings to get all the moves down I always liked the way the DVD was laid out with the option to put together your own workouts, but what she needs is to add some sections that are in between the preview and her full bore speed where she actually calls things out and maybe breaks them down a little before putting the whole combo together like you would do in every step class I've ever taken. I'm an advanced stepper, but this DVD was disappointing"

With time the padding on the seats has gone down...as has the quality of the padding on my backside. This seat was just the answer! The day they came (one for each bike) I put them on and we went for a ride. Smooth, comfy and no need to stop along the way for a rest break. Pretty easy to put on the seat posts that were on the bikes. Hardest part was getting the old seats off. Install was made easier with two ratchets as these seats had two bolts as opposed to the single on the old seats."

Once strapped on they were unobtrusive; I was able to slide mine around underneath the armrest on my 177RG Cardinal so it didn't interfere with lapboard and charts. My only minor quibble is that the yellow activating pulls dangle loose - good while wearing overwater, for easy activation in an emergency - but prone to being caught and pulled by mistake when the SOSpenders are being retrieved from their storage spot in seatback pockets. I've stuffed our pulls back into the cover, just need to remember to pull them back out if ever a water landing is imminent."

I am 5'6"" and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs. I have an athletic body tyoe. This does feel real tight. I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well. It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured. I use this for cycling and it works perfectly, keeping sweat away. I think the tight fit looks awesome, but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you."

438017,0,"I bought a refurbished Total Gym 2000 from a company called Fitness Quest (which appeared to be the outlet for Total Gyms at the time), through an online auction site. That was 7 or 8 years ago. The seat only said ""Total Gym"", not ""Total Gym 2000"", but it looked like the same product. It has served me well over the years. Now it makes a lot of noise when I use it, which is only a problem during the summer when I have the windows open and I don't want to give the neighbors any weird ideas. (It sounds almost like a bed squeaking.) I have also progressed to the point where I have my Total Gym at it's highest setting, and I would like to purchase the optional weight bar attachment to add more weight.I was unable to find the weight bar attachment for this model on the manufacturer's web site, so I clicked on their ""contact us"" link to inquire about the weight bar attachment, how much weight the Total Gym would support, and how I can lubricate the joints to reduce the noise. After a week, the company did not reply. I emailed them again, explaining that I had been recommending this product to all my friends and would start recommending people to *not* buy this product if they didn't have the decency to reply, even if it was only to say ""I don't know"". It's been more than two months, and the company still hasn't replied.At this point, my impression is that it's a good product while it works. If it gets noisy over time, I guess you will have to live with it. If you don't order the optional attachments at time of purchase, good luck finding them later. If you need support from the company, forget it. I read that some people have problems with the wheels under the seat wearing out. I hope it doesn't happen to me, because I won't know where to get replacements. As for the weight bar attachment, I guess I will have to make my own using tubular steel or aluminum and getting some barbell weights to attach to it. As for the weight limit, I will have to search the house for the manual, which I didn't think I would need after all these years.When my Total Gym finally breaks, I will not buy another one. Some companies just don't understand that service after the sale is just as important as selling the product in the first place. The commercials were impressive and the results of using the product were impressive, too. I really loved it. If you don't mind paying money for something you might need to replace later, go for it. Until the company wakes up, I will rank them along the lines of the company that made the $50 plastic (Suncast) water hose reel that broke. (To add insult to injury, it was relabeled as a ""trusty"" Sears Craftsman!) I refuse to pay $50 every few years for a plastic hose reel or any kind of product that isn't going to last. If I was into that scene, I would buy everything from Walmart!"
432137,1,"I was in need of a general purpose backpack. Not too large, not too small, and one that I would only use a few times a year. I read the reviews on various backpacks sold at Amazon.com, REI, and other sporting goods retailers. Since I wasn't going to use it that much, I couldn't bring myself to spend $100-$300. The feedback on this pack was that it was a solid pack for the money.Took it camping this past weekend and I have to say that I don't think that you can find a better pack for the money ($88 through Amazon.com). Some of my fellow campers could not believe how nice of a bag it was, and were even more surprised when I told them what I paid for it. The pack is very well built. At 65 liters, it is big enough for a few days worth of backpacking. It is a top-loading drawstring design, with two smaller external compartments. The shoulder straps fit very nice and it was comfortable to use, even fully loaded. There are straps on the top, sides, and bottom to compress the pack once it is loaded.I would definitely not recommend this for anyone with a 36"" or smaller waist due to the size of the waist straps. I have a 38"" waist and had the waist straps cinched up almost all the way. It is not the lightest backpack, but since I'm not climbing K-2 anytime soon, it works fine for my needs.I would have liked the Chipotle color, but not enough to spend an extra $20-$30."

119755,0,"I bought this cooler in preparation for an 18-day road trip, after poring over customer reviews. It's not a terrible cooler, but it definitely wasn't what I thought it would be and I'm disappointed in the purchase because it didn't do what I needed it to do.The Good:- The retractable handle and the wheels make it easy to cart around- It is really spacious- The lid is big which allows extra space at the top- There is a drain- The upright shape means it doesn't take up as much floor space in my vanThe Bad:- The top pops off repeatedly- It doesn't stay colder than a regular, run of the mill cooler. MaxCold? Really? We had to change the ice every single day because every single day it all melted. There were a couple nights when a small amount of the ice didn't completely melt overnight, but we still had to change it every day. I had frozen things in the cooler because other reviewers had stated that frozen things stayed frozen in this cooler. However, this was not the case for us. Nothing stayed frozen. It was thawed by the time we stopped for lunch on the very first day.- When full, it is really heavy and cumbersome to lift in and out of the vehicle. Maybe because of the shape, I found it difficult to get a good grip on it.We typically opened the cooler once a day for lunch, and again at night to check the ice situation. I have a different brand of cooler that is an ""ultra cold"" model that works awesome, but I wanted something bigger for this trip. Our other one we have taken camping in the summer for a whole weekend, in & out of it several times a day, and the ice stays frozen the whole time.It was very, very hot at times (sometimes over 100 degrees outside) when we used this cooler, and I'm sure that had something to do with its performance issues. But even on cooler days, it didn't do what I hoped it would do. What I was hoping to avoid was changing ice every single day, and that is exactly what I wound up doing. I thought maybe I wasn't using enough ice, but even when I increased the ice by quite a bit, it still didn't stay frozen.I wouldn't suggest this cooler if you truly need your stuff to stay ice cold for more than half a day or so. Maybe we just got a defective one, considering that others seemed to have a much better experience with it."
200143,1,I purchased these for a hike with friends up the Virgin River in Zion Utah in October. They worked great. The fit was good and neoprene kept my feet really warm during our four hour hike up the narrows. Water temp was in the 40's and most (all) of the hike you walk directly in the river. I also had great canyon shoes (Canyoneer 2 by Five Ten). Will use them for kayaking as well.

For instance the XL in the jacket is a perfect fit for me, but in the vest I had to exchange the XL for a L ... The vest seems to run a size larger, and I think it would be a better design had they also included the bottom draw strings on the vest as they have on the jackets (being that the vests cost as much as the jackets) ... Had I been able to find a brown vest in the style of a black one I got from Land's End I would have returned this L also ... Bottom line for me Columbia Sportswear Jackets 5*'s, the best I can give this vest is 3*'s."
198572,0,"I rated the earlier version of this watch a 5 because for its price it did everything superbly. Had just the right number of features and ergonomics. Really a fantastic watch for running, swimming, etc. My original died because the watch straps on these cannot be replaced and it broke. This new version has a stronger watch strap BUT the buttons on it are TERRIBLE. T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E. I wish I could go back to the previous version. Every time, literally every time, I click a button it draws a tiny bit of anger from me because so much pressure is needed. Particularly the lap button on the top I literally have to grab the other side of my wrist to brace it against my thumb as I push it. I know that my watch is not a freak one, since another reviewer found the same problem.This watch was previously perfect except for the strap. Now with a better strap it could be the essence of an inexpensive and functional watch but for some unknown reason Timex insisted on semi destroying its functionality with these absurd buttons. Why, Timex, why?*UPDATE* I really, really want nobody to buy this watch. As a measure of what I mean by its ridiculous lap button: I'm looking at mine now. When the button was molded the words start and stop are on it in 3D--not painted on or anything, but literally recessed below the top. The pressure required to use this thing now has the center of it flush with the bottom of these words, effectively smearing it. And I haven't been doing much lap activity since I bought it, either, so simply my finger has sanded away a good portion of the button because of how ridiculously stiff it is."

266201,0,"I have the first version of GPS III and the new version has some very good improvements. Most noticeably, an upgradeable map and waterproof case (mine has neither). As a climber and backpacker, I haven't had much need for GPS. A road map and road signs get me where I need to go. Once an unexpected detour (car accident) made it nice to have so I could get around it on the fly. I have also used it for playing around trying to find off-the-beaten-track short cuts. It would also come in handy for navigating off the coast, marking dive sites and whatnot, but I have yet to use it in that capacity. In the backcountry, I find a compass and topo much more convenient. They are lighter and I don't have to worry about batteries. The battery life is very short. Mine lasted about 8-9 hours. They claim 24-36h on the new version. This in my opinion is still too short. It's definitely a battery-eating monster at 4 AA batteries. I use mine mostly in the car. You have to buy the car adapter separately. Even with improved accuracy, with the US government turning off the built in error factor, I still find GPS a toy. Unless you need to ocean navigate, are a traveling salesperson or just want a cool toy, I'd save your money. Otherwise, Garmin GPS III is the top of the line GPS with great features if you need them."

(I tried it on a 1.25"" harness leather belt.) This holster rides high. I bought this for a Ruger Old Army which has a 7.5 inch barrel. It's difficult to draw and to reinsert the revolver back in the holster.There is no strap adjustment tool and the holster does not have a thumb break. For those with smaller handguns, this holster cannot be worn inside the waistband as stated in the description.Other than that the holster is well made."

188261,0,"$15 should buy about 1500 strike-anywhere matches. The Firesteel's 12000 strike lifetime is about equal to that, perhaps a little longer, without the bulk but also without the builtin kindling of the matchstick. It's easy enough to waterproof matchheads in candlewax. With that said, the Firesteel, striker, and a dozen cottonballs soaked in Vaseline fits in an old McCormick spice jar. 6 boxes of 250 matches each is significantly bulkier.The firesteel comes with a protective paint coating on the stick. This needs to be scraped off before use. This is undoubtedly the reason for the complaints of difficulties. It strikes easily and consistently once the paint has been scraped off.There's something primally satisfying about striking a fire without benefit of pre-packaged combustibles, but the Firesteel's magnesium body and chromed steel striker is anything but primitive. Nonetheless, the modernity doesn't dampen my satisfaction the slightest. I'm averaging about 3 to 5 strikes to light well prepared tinder in ideal, still air conditions. The small size and easy packability makes it a winner here."

I carry two books and three notebooks at most and it is hard to get things in and out. It also does not have adequate storage for pens and differnt things like that. There is one zippered compartment in the inside for change and that type of thing but the other interior compartments are open and my stuff falls out. I think that this would be good for a carrying your stuff while your hanging out downtown or something, going on a day trip, etc. but not necessarily as a primary backpack for school where you'll carry several books/notebooks etc."
180110,2,"I bought this as a pack for my Lab to participate in a charity dog walk. The morning of the walk we put 6 16oz bottles of water (3 per side)and a small towel in it to carry for us and hopefully (as Ceasar puts it) give him some more work. I put it on him several weeks ago when we got it to get him used to it. He wore it comfortably for about an hour so I'm confident we it had adjusted well. I tell him to wait by the door and go open the truck, call him to load up, he jumps in and the front strap disintigrates. Literally nothing left the webbing holding the buckle to the right side is gone. I look at the way this is sewn and its prety easy to see what happened. The webbing is looped to itself with one row of stitching, not sewn thru or around. It is also nylon or some marterial not condusive to use as webbing. I looked at the $50-60 saddle bags and thought I wouldn't get my monies worth. I hate being wrong like most people but I hate calling a company asking for a refund or something else worse. Chalk this one up to not following instincts. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT It really is made poorly."

125705,1,"Recently, I had the chance to handle Leatherman's Charge TTi, which could be considered their premier model. Although it was definitely of high quality, its movement and feel was more clunky than expected. The Swiss Spirit, on the other hand, has a movement like no other - totally fluid and precise. As someone who has already handled several of Victorinox's Swiss Army Knives, I thought I couldn't be ""wow'ed"" anymore by their quality, but this tool exceeded my expectation. It's great for home repair, electrical work, and outdoor excursions.A few notes on the design:The locking tools are the highlight for me. Every tool locks into place when extended; the mechanism is easy to operate yet very effective.The tool itself is fairly small and relatively lightweight yet solid. For such a small size, it embodies a good combination of functionality and versatility, and it fits my hand perfectly (average sized guy's hand).It should be noted that the pliers move very freely and do not stick, spring back (into an open position), or hold their position. Some might count this as a negative, but I believe its functionality to be, nevertheless, unhindered and, perhaps, favorable.The tools themselves cover a wide range of on-the-job necessities, that have already come in handy in numerous situations - I do some light carpentry and construction on occasion and regular yard work.The carrying case is also a major plus. Although the tools are stainless steel, anyone who knows their steels can tell you that even stainless steels can rust when neglected. The case is made of a fairly thick brown leather with a velcro closure that should shelter the tools from the weather and general neglect. I personally love the look of it too - very classic/timeless styling.All in all, I can't see how anyone could think they made a bad purchase on this item. I was on the fence for awhile, did a little research on the tool, debated about buying it some more, and eventually figured it wouldn't kill me if I got it... and I'm glad I did... and you will be too."
282135,0,"I've been using this for a variety of workouts recently from the P90X program.I'll start by saying for plyometrics this thing is a godsend. With just a bit of attention to how you're jumping it's so thick I feel very little impact most of the time.For yoga floorwork it's amazing. I can spend 5 minutes balanced awkwardly on one knee and never have (the knee) get uncomfortable.For any exercise that spreads you out and places pressure on the mat though it's subpar for 2 reasons.1st: It has absolutely no texture and is VERY smooth. It's also waterproof. Even a tiny bit of perspiration on your palms (or dripping off your face) makes keeping your hands in place for some push-ups and poses almost impossible.2nd: Even if you can get a grip, the foam will stretch and give rather a lot. I've noticed a slide of about 2"" when doing things like downward dog. Definetly not ideal, and for yoga I'm almost certainly going to have to replace it.The softness of it is also a bit of a problem sometimes with the memory of the foam. It likes to indent to (and then stick to) shoe soles sometimes. It can also make balance poses tricky when you realize suddenly the foam you're balanced on is about as smooth as a teenage concession worker's face.As far as smell goes, it has a bit of a rubber odor but that disipated quickly. And within 48 hours of unrolling it it had become quite flat.Overall: as a mat for floorwork like crucnches and jumping/impact exercises its actually fantastic. It's very comfortable and takes out a ton of impact. For things that require careful positioning and places any tension on the mat though it's miserable so don't expect to have this be perfect."

379672,1,"I've been drumming for about 5 years; these are bar none the best sticks I've ever used. The size is perfect, the balance is exquisite, and the weight is just right. They hit hard, but they're light enough that they seem to fly around on command. They're pretty durable too. Drumming is most satisfying when done with conviction (read: beat the hell out of them) and since I like angling my crashes away from me sticks don't usually last me very long before they get sawed up and split. These lasted a comparably long time; one of them didn't even split, the tip just broke off. The logo didn't last very long - it faded away with sweat and friction and left a discoloration on that part of the stick. I don't care about that; I didn't buy them for the logo but for the feel, though I admit my decision may have been swayed ever so slightly by the fact they've got Neil Peart's name on them. I just ordered a 3-pack of the White Oak variety. I expect them to be at least as exceptional."

195034,1,"First I'll have to say I was a bit disappointed. I ordered this grill earlier this month and paid $299.00 for it. Now it's price has been reduced to $255.88 and since it wasn't sold directly from Amazon.com, there won't be a price adjustment made. Amazon did however adjust the price $10.00 lower for the grill cover I ordered.Assembly was pretty easy. I have arthritis and tremors, so if I can do it I'm sure it would be a breeze for someone that isn't severly handicapped. I'm a stickler about noticing poorly designed products, and I thought the grill was extremely well designed. I wanted something simple that didn't take up a lot of space. I didn't want or need a warming rack that would have never been used. I didn't need a side burner like my old grill had. I never used it even once.I was concerned about buying a grill with plastic legs and tables, but it's very stable and it won't be rusting and needing re-painting like my last two grills did.The lid is cast of very thin alumnium. It almost feels too fragile and gives me cause to worry about it getting cracked if subjected to a hail storm. I doubt if the cover would soften the blow enough to protect it.I would have preferred an electronic ignitor, but the push button type on this one fired it up the first try. A fuel level indicator of some sort would have been nice also, but I keep a spare tank in my storage shed.I have only used this grill once so far and I was very impressed with the results. My wife of 40 years claims it's the best rib-eye I've ever grilled.I pre-heated the grill as suggested and then shut off the center burner while I was grilling. I set a timer for the suggested grilling time and as suggested, I only turned the steaks once. I was nervous about grilling a steak this way because in the past I've relied on appearance to judge when the steaks were done.My wife likes her steak meduim rare, so I cooked her's for 11 minutes. I left mine on for an additional 3 minutes since I like mine medium well. Both steaks were exactly how we like them. They had nice evenly colored grill marks without a hint of charring, which I hate to bite into.I never understood the loyal following that Weber has until now. You may pay more for the brand, but you get something that is actually designed to do a very good job in return.I bought the griddle that fits this grill locally since it was on sale. My wife hates cooking bacon in the house because of the smell that lingers. Guess where the bacon will be cooked in the future.I plan on getting years of use from this great (not so little) grill."
9059,0,"The gun is very light, because its made of cheap plastic. It still holds together nice, and its a good starter gun I suppose. The scope has no glass, just plastic. 200 FPS is about right, not that powerful but it'll do for CQB. The bipod is ok, but since the scope really doesn't do anything, its just for looks. Easy to cock, easy to shoot. Doesn't really jam so that's good.Its not too expensive, but if I had a second chance I wouldn't of bought it."

363097,1,"I started swimming about 6 months ago to get in shape. Pool chlorine really bothers my eyes; even a little exposure will cause hours of discomfort. I tried 10 or 12 different goggles in a variety of sizes and styles. For my face, the Hydrospex is the most effective. It keeps ANY water from reaching my eyes - all of the others leaked to some degree, regardless of price or configuration. My 10-year-old swam competitively this summer, and she also tried quite a few alternatives before settling on the Hydrospex Jr.These Speedo goggles have stood up to 5-7 swims per week for 5 months now with no signs of wear. The headband stays adjusted, the gaskets form a great seal around the eyes, and the anti-fog feature is a nice benefit. I've dropped them in the parking lot, and they ride around in my workout bag continuously, as I swim at different locations on different days, but they still look new. I've bought a 2nd set in case I ever manage to lose or break these - I don't want to be without them!Just a note - some of the other goggles that I tried were also Speedos, and others were also respected brands, but the Hydrospex are by far the best fit for my personal facial shape. Be aware when selecting goggles that each design will fit people differently. It doesn't make a particular brand or model ""good"" or ""bad"", it's just what works for an individual. Shop around and try different styles until you find what works for you . Once you find the right fit, you should experience no leakage or discomfort. For me, the Hydrospex are just the right ones."

508237,0,"This made in China vest has a price & features that made it a purchase. I bought one for an emergency tote I am assembling. It provides a way to assemble magazines, multi-tools, etc. in one organized location that can be worn when needed. I gave it a lower rating because of a strong chemical odor when it was unpackaged. It's been hanging outside on my deck for 4 weeks. I didn't want to wash it because I was thinking of returning it. But the odor has diminished so I will wash it. I hope it will be good to go. Contacting the seller about the odor didn't garner any kind of useful response. I suppose the seller wants to ignore a potential issue. If anyone around you has chemical odor sensitivity don't buy this vest. I suspect the Chinese assemblers might be using something not allowed for manufacturing in other countries."

458159,0,"My 9 yr old loves his new baseball sunglasses with interchangeable lenses; he looks cool and can field those fly balls with greater ease. We both are frustrated by two things, however:1. The lenses pop in easily, but that ensures that flop out easily. They just don't stay in the frame as well as they should for active wear.2. That problem creates another: a case is not provided (for which we would have gladly paid extra), so storage is difficult, and the lens pops out when we try to put it in a bag we're using until we can find a case large enough to accomodate the sunglasses and all the lenses.If the manufacturer would tweak the design a bit and include a case, we would have paid up to $[...] for these otherwise useful and attractive sunglasses."

505952,1,"I bought this watch as a replacement for an older Timex Datalink watch. I really like the Datalink series for many reasons, like the ability to hold contact info and remind me of upcoming birthdays and such. It has many functions that are easily programmable through your computer, and all the information can be backed up for future use. The drawback..... these watches have no right saying ""Ironman"", they aren't delicate but they certainly are not up to the ""toughness"" level of other Ironman watches I have owned. My last one had the resin strap literally disintegrate over time, after purchasing a new strap ($30) and having the battery replaced ($10), it stopped functioning and reset itself on 4 different occasions. The quote from Timex to repair the watch was about $100 (CAD), I was able to purchase a newer model for about $90 CAD (including shipping, taxes, exchange etc), this somehow seems a bit odd. I know many things cost more to repair than replace, but Timex could have replaced the innards for a lot less than $100. So I ended up spending $40 needlessly, only to purchase a brand new model. I still recommend the watch but c'mon Timex, how about a little customer care?"
36308,1,"What I really wanted was a ground sleeve that would allow me to remove the pole and cap the sleeve for winter storage. That's not what this unit is designed for. I bought a different sleeve with a cap which was metal as directed by sports authority, but they neglected to tell me it was not universal and was designed for a particular product. It cost me half the price and was the type I wanted, but it would not fit with my huffy basket ball poll. I recieved my basket ball poll, backboard and net, about 14 years ago as a present and still had it perfect in the box, never installed. I bought this since it said it works with spaulding and huffy. It fit perfectly. It's plastic not metal. Not sure how it will hold up over time, but so far it's great. It was easy to install. It has no cap at all. It's design is to be left in place and allows you to remove the poll only so you can take it with you if you ever move. I can't imagine I'd do that as most polls rust over time and most backboards fade so you'd mostly likely leave it there and get a new one anyway. Probably not a good idea to remove your basket ball pole unless you design your own cap as items like water, snow, and leaves will fall in over time. I can't fault the product for that. It does what it was designed to do, works well, just not what I had really wanted."
358812,0,The Amphibian made by Kershaw is a small double edged knife with a partial serration and kydex sheath. The knife is light weight and razor sharp. The kydex sheath easily attaches to your belt the only problem is the knife rattles constanly when on the move. Since the knife is double edged it is impossible to brace your thumb on the spine of the blade for more precise cutting. That being said if you did end up falling in love with it you would be unable to EDC carry it as it is technically a dagger [this is true for Texas it might be different in other states lookk up your states knife laws to find out]. Long story short it is a cool little knife but i've never used it and would recommend it only as a collectible.

175896,1,"I served aboard an Amphibious Warfare Ship, LST 1198. Her name was the USS Bristol County, based in San Diego. This was back during Pres Reagan's first term in office.Our operations throughout the tens of thousands of miles we sailed, virtually ALWAYS involved line/rope and being dependent upon it being in top milspec condition. Be it in an emergency cast off, sailor entangled, or dangerous cargo needing jettisoned, there was only ONE knife that was used, the Buck 110. There were certain operations that required that a seasoned man, be at the ready, with a razor sharp Buck. His job? To rapidly cut through a 3"" mooring line or similar rope, on command. When I say razor, I mean razor. The edge capable of being held on this model, is the stuff legends are made of.No joke.This knife set the standard back in the 60's, was duly recognized by active duty sailors as the best lock blade knife ever made. The Buck 110 stood up to the most hostile conditions at sea, on shore and abroad.The knife is virtually bullet proof, and I can tell you from experience, it will NEVER fail you when needed most."

I'm looking for a similar design that uses gels instead.
37052,0,Price was kind of high for the quality. Dad is a die hard Packers fan so I got it for him anyway.
263161,1,Descriptions are good. Reviews helped me decide after looking at all the products. Price beats the more expensive ones that probably do the same thing. Liked that the finish on the bar protects paint on bike. Delivery was also timely. I would buy another for our other bike.
430386,0,It is ok but won't last more than few weeks. I have bought two of them in the past. confirm it.the quality is not that good.

235022,0,"I own both the Buck 326 (scholar frame lock made in China) and the Buck 525 (Gent lock back made in the USA). The Buck 326 Scholar is a decent knife. It has one glaring flaw, at least for the way I use these knives. I use these knives as a daily carry gentleman's knife. I find that the Buck 326's opening assist studs dig into my leg, making it very uncomfortable to carry. The 326 Scholar is also about double the width of the Gent, making it more visible with dress pants. The Gent is the perfect size and shape to make you forget that you are carrying it, yet it's ready for use for many small jobs that arise. The Gent also out-classes the Scholar in looks and design. If you're looking for a small daily carry gentleman's knife that goes well with casual or suit pants, I recommend the Buck 525 Gent. The Gent is one of those products that makes you feel intelligent for buying it every time you use it.Warning: If you let someone use either the Buck 326 or the 525, make sure you get it back. These knives have invisible legs, which is not noted in the description."
185967,1,Can't really beat the price on these. Material is really light but quality is still there. Pockets seem to hang a little too low when you have a few things in them (wallet and phone).

181933,1,"I purchased this sling for my Remington 700 .308 and am not disappointed. They claim that this sling will not come out of adjustment unless it's intentional, and they aren't kidding (this while being extremely easy to adjust, no clips, hooks or any other non-sense). Adjustments from slung to shooting position is lightning quick, and easy to tweek without coming fully out of your shooting position. I've used this sling for shooting prone, standing and in sitting positions. In all cases, you can lock down like a rock. This is used in conjunction with a HS Precision Stock; zero flex in the sling or the stock. Very pleased with this product; I'll definitely buy again."

486498,2,At first I though I would be a very good one. But after using for a while it shown to be not so good. It does not hold the air and every morning you have to pump air to be able to sleep at night. I returned the first one I purchased back to Amazon. I am very much impressed with Amazon customer service. They were as fast as it can be to send me a new air mattress to replace the first one I have purchased with them. Congratulations!Outstanding customer service!
135402,0,"I bought this for hauling groceries on 2 mile market trips. It is sturdy and well sewn. The style is attractive. I reserve further approval because the straps meant to add more stability and support for heavier loads are in the wrong place for an average woman.Specifically, the sternum strap falls directly across the bust in a way that is both painful and potentially injurious. I am 5'6"" and of very average build. Looking for an adjustment, I found no way around the unfortunate strap placement. The sternum strap needs to be a few inches lower or higher to be of any use to a woman. I seriously doubt any women will be able to fasten these straps without having the same issue. This area is not meant to bear a weight!I am disappointed that the description does not mention that it really is not a gender-neutral pack. I wanted to be able to use the extra straps in order to distribute and secure heavier loads. Since the sternum strap is useless, I cannot ever get the full and intended benefit of the design. The reason I purchased this model was to have the weight more distributed over the body, otherwise, I would have skipped the extra flaps and straps for a more streamlined design. I will look very closely at my next pack before buying this feature again."

486553,0,"Have used this as a great guest bed since 2008. Problem: after maybe a total of 3-4 months of use, now something on the interior has popped, there are HUGE bumps on the surface and it has to be replaced. Would give this an easy five stars for comfort and features, but don't think it's been used enough to have to discard it. (I have noted quite a few others here reporting the same complaint, and someone posted photos of the problem).Here's the run-down.THE POSITIVES:--VERY comfortable. I bought a puffy mattress-cover to go with it, which makes it downright dreamy to sleep on, but very comfortable even without. Great reviews on comfort from people of all ages, including an elderly woman who has trouble sleeping.--Good air pump. Quick and easy to inflate and deflate.--It did have a plastic smell at first, but I left it near an open window for a few days, and the odor dissipated completely.--A little bulky to drag around, but worth the comfort.--Nice looking.--Can sleep two easily, but as mentioned in other reviews, it's more a full- than a queen-sized bed.SOMEWHAT NEGATIVE:--Sort of easy to get a rip in it. Not long after I bought it, it inflated into the back of an office chair, and wound up with a thick gash over an inch long. (N.B., I had to try a few patch-kit brands; the AeroBed patch kit is the only one that worked for such a big hole. It comes with polyurethane adhesive and clear plastic sheets that are 2"" or 3"" square, and can be cut to size. Surprisingly, it's not available on Amazon. I bought it from Gracious Homes, which sells it online). Anyway, have been very careful since, and no more punctures.VERY NEGATIVE:--The bed suddenly developed an internal tear, and there's a huge and growing lump on top (as my mother put it, it looks pregnant). Not usable any more. Maybe I over-inflated it?? I don't know... Also, I don't know how this item's lifespan compares to that of other similar products, though I've had a single simple, non-elevated (and slightly less comfortable) Aerobed for years with no problem.As it's not terribly expensive, have been considering whether to buy this again, but I REALLY hate having to throw huge plastic things into landfills after a pretty short life. AND, given how many people have had the same problem (some after just a couple of weeks), there is clearly a big design flaw.If this can bed be overfilled, wish there were clear and obvious instructions on the bed as to how to avoid that--or they should develop an air escape mechanism that simply prevents over-inflation. How hard can that be?"
176975,0,"I was disappointed in the quality of the handle of this knife. I have purchased several Buck knives, including the Buck 500 and the Buck 503 Prince that I bought for my grandson, and they have always been well made. I thought about returning it, because I'm pretty sure Buck would have replaced it, but understanding this is a ""carrying knife"" and not collector quality, I decided not to hassle with it."
445180,0,"I purchased this umbrella last winter after researching on Amazon. I live in Southern California, so I don't use my umbrella on a daily basis. I wanted something sturdy that would last more than one season so I wouldn't have to purchase one again. This umbrella was great last winter, it worked as well as everyone reported. However, we had our second rainstorm of the winter in California this week and the umbrella is starting fall to apart. The top nob came off and one of the spokes has separated from the umbrella. I don't think this product was worth the extra money since I am in search of a new one again after only 1 year."
484369,1,"I feel this is designed for .12 spring guns. If you have one, the bbs will stick, and within a few seconds, roll down, so you don't have bb to bb contact. A 330 fps .25 GBB will rip through the gel layer and ricochet off the foam behind it. Other than that, it's great. It's also washable. The gel shouldn't lose it's stick."

166393,2,"I have had a polar fitness watch for two years now that I have been very satisfied with. When my husband gave me this cycling computer for my birthday I was completely surprised and ecstatic. I immediately ran outside to install it. After 1.5 hours of trying to get a speed reading to appear we determined that the unit was broken. Based on reviews on other sites it is most likely the battery in the sensor is dead. Either way, too much of my life was wasted on this product. When there are many better ones out there. That being said, I did give it two stars because I don't have any reason to believe that every unit shipped is defective and if you get a working one it's probably ok."
429518,0,"Stamina SpaceMate Folding StepperI bought this because the price was right, because it is very compact, and because I do need an exercise machine to use when the weather is bad, or when I just don't feel like climbing the hills around my place. After having received it, I can also add that it is very well built, and should last forever. HOWEVER, I doubt that I'll be using it much. It looks like it's going to join those other machines that I have bought but that just didn't work out for me. It's a matter of taste, which I why I say that you should try using a Stepper before buying one, even one this low-priced. I just don't like the stepping experience. It's just not something I can force myself to do for more than a minute or two, and that is of no exercise value. That about sums it up for me, but for those people who are now planning to criticize me for rating this machine based only upon my own opinion and experience, don't bother. This machine is not for me, and I've explained why. I only post reviews like this in the hope that it will help others from making the same mistakes that I did. If this offends some Stepper fans out there, so be it."

20254,0,"After having tented for 15 years in our HUGE Wenzel family cabin-type tent, the poor thing finally gave-out. I did a lot of research on the Cougar Flats before I bought it and was pretty excited about camping in it. I set it up in the yard in 30 minutes flat (1st time;alone; I'm a 45 yr.old woman) and was immediately impressed with the quality of the materials used to make the tent. Flash forward to a 5-day camping trip in Maine which coincided with the crazy rains that the Northeastern U.S. got in July of 2006 and you'll see a very unhappy camper. Oh...the tent didn't leak at the seams (I used seam sealer), or through the sides, but plenty of water managed to get into the tent whenever the kids or I had to access the tent. I immediately recognized the design flaw and I could've kicked myself for not seeing it BEFORE I bought the tent: the rain-fly does not shelter the entrance to the tent. Inevitably, someone has to go in or out of the tent during a rainstorm. Every time this happens, the door swings inward, and all of the water on the outwardly-sloping door runs all over the floor as the door swings inward; if you try to hold onto the door so that it doesn't swing inward, you basically are ""touching the side of the tent"" while it's raining, and all of us campers KNOW what that means...if you touch a tent side when it rains, water leaks through the spot where you touched, and it continues to leak until it has had a chance to completely dry-out. All of this is compounded with the major zipper problem at the door...what a pain in the butt! Omigosh! By the end of two and a half days of rain, I was ready to tear the stupid zipper off of the tent. The fact that the zipper got caught unless you used two hands to mess around with it, was only half of the source of my frustration. The zipper pull on the zipper itself (not the cloth-pull, but the metal-pull) kept swiveling in such a way as to make it impossible to zip the zipper at all unless you straightened it out, and then pulled it shut (again, requiring two hands); all of THIS, as I stood hunched over with my back becoming thoroughly drenched and the skies pouring out its rains directly into the tent because the rainfly is deficient in sheltering the door. Okay...1. I would NOT buy this tent again unless they redesigned the rain-fly to be some sort of a canopy which shelters the doorway.2. The zipper-catching problem is the least annoying aspect - I could deal with it because the quality of this tent is super.3. The zipper- pull situation is maddening - especially in the pouring rain; I am going to fix this by breaking off the manufacturer's metal-pull and putting one of my own on it.I like the spaciousness of the tent, the bells and whistles (cup-holders, remote light, shelves - ridiculous) do nothing for me, the rain-fly was awesome and protected our heads from the rain quite well, but overall, I'm pretty bummed that there is no canopy, or extension of the rainfly over the doorway...I could kick myself for not noticing it beforehand. Now I'm stuck ""tarping"" a new tent...ugh..."

It sits nicely on the wrist and the crown movement feels solid.The thing that lets this watch down is the strap, which altough genuine leather has a cheap, plasticy feel - and the clasp, which is thin and rattly and identifies the watch as a low-budget pretender. Also, the presentation box is quite overdone - less is more, guys!Overall, I'm happy with this as a day to day general purpose timepiece. It's not at all bad for the price if you get it on sale - just don't pay full retail!"

173012,1,"I've had this thing for over four years. I break it out once a season to hone up. Overall, it works well. The carpet is thick and more than smooth enough for the purpose, considering it's stored and shipped all folded up. Let's just say it ""relaxes"" into a usable putting surface. A foot b4 the cup there's a ramp to help develop an accelerating stroke. Sometimes I like this feature, other times, eh....it's necessitated by the return system. It does allow a successful putt to plop satisfyingly into the hole. Said return system does work, but fitfully. One return is the length of the mat, the next only 3 feet. I find this to be acceptable, becuz on the course you'll rarely have two putts the same length. One good thing, it's AC powered. Never go battery power with one of these puppies. All in all, I like it, it's durable, and it actually translates onto the course. More short putts fall if you practice more short putts, who'da thunk it. One other thing. I leave this set up in the living room for a couple of weeks at a time. No one seems to mind. I come home and the teenagers are trying to best each other on it. I even sidle behind the little lady to help her with her stroke....;-)"
54162,2,"Great slipper--could NOT find the size chart anywhere, when trying to place the order. What does Medium mean for a men's shoe? I thought that my 12 yr. old son would surely be able to wear them. I was wrong on Christmas--Medium meant too small. Irritating."
494010,0,"Using the sharp edges of the ceramic rods is easy; however, using the flat sides is very difficult. For maximum efficiency, it's vital that the blade's edge be held against the flat edge of the rod. Despite those who say it's easy, I find it difficult to hold the blade flat against the rods. Using the sharp sides is infinitely easier, but if you're able to do it -- more power to you.Another problem is angles. The angles on the Sharpmaker are fine for most kitchen knives, but for fine clip-on everyday carry knives, it's a hit-or-miss system. You'll always be able to make your knife sharper, but you won't be able to put the finest edge possible on your knives, despite what the videos indicate.Finally, if you want a mirror finish on your edges, buy polish. My brother spent $300+ on a water stone set that will put beautiful edges on his knives, but few people want to spend that much unless they can do it for money.All in all, I can get similar results from aLansky 4-rod Turn Box Crock Stick Sharpener (LCD5D)as I can the Sharpmaker (though you have to make sure you don't cut your steadying hand off!).For people who want exact angles, I recommend theLansky Deluxe 5-Stone Sharpening System. It uses the same basic approach that my brother's water stone sharpener uses, though the stones are different. It's a bit of a pain to set up and use, but it gets the angles right.Again, the Sharpmaker is a good quick system, but for the money I think it's a bit pricey. Get a couple of Lansky 4-rod Crock Stick Sharpeners instead. Keep one clean and one not-so-clean. My local gun shop has a Sharpmaker for free use, and it's very popular. It's also filthy. If I were running Spyderco, I'd be giving Sharpmakers to gun stores, hardware stores, bars and so forth and sell a bundle of them. They really are great for kitchen knives. But using the flat sides of the rods are a pain."

Loved the overall feel and comfort and cosmetic appeal (its important for all wearing apparel to look good, yes? Smile, yes.) I bought them to replace my very worn Nike's. But, and I really hate to say this, here's the thing. The stitching down between the fingers is incomplete. Between most all the fingers. At first I thought maybe they were made that way, or maybe I just hoped so. But I don't think they are. The failure to fully stitch the leather between the fingers is bothersome, but for my purposes wasn't enough for me to go to the trouble to send them back. I probably should, and most would, and in all honesty, I thought Mizuno had higher quality control standards. Other than that.....smile, yeah, other than that, they are quite nice."

It works well and has held up well except for one minor thing. The one I got had a grey coating over the outside stainless steel. There was no coating on the inside. After about a year, the outer coating started peeling off in irregular patches. I finally scrubbed it all off with a Scotchbrite pad. Now mine looks pretty much like a plain stainless steel one. I'd recommend skipping any of the colored ones, in favor of the plain SS model. Other than that one minor thing, this is a great product."

168764,0,"this sash definitely works as far as being very reflective, however, it seems to ride around some. it isn't too bad and i can usually wriggle it into fitting after several twists. it sort of depends on what type of shirt you are wearing. a little awkward."

474651,0,"Make sure the Deluxe grill is what you are purchasing. Found a Rico deluxe grill for around 27 bucks. Looked exactly the same as Rico Deluxe grills that were 50 or 60 dollars. Thought I just found a great price. Read product reviews and they were exactly the same for both items...which led me to believe they were exact same item. I saw reviews that said it was great and saw some that said it was poorly made and ripped easily. I decided to take a chance and ordered it.Turns out you get what you pay for....one rain and the velcro straps ripped right off and the bbq was wet underneath. It was a thick as a ""hefty"" garbage bag. Which is exactly what is was good for...garbage. I sent an email and I got a quick response. Not only did they refund me the money, but the sent me a deluxe cover free of charge...way more than they had to do. I would have been happy with a refund. They said it was a mistake in advertising and that they would take care of it on their end. Hasn't happened yet, but because of their professionalism and great customer service, I'm thinking they will do the right thing!So altough I was highly disappointed with the original cover the second cover they sent me is beautiful (not just because I bought a Yankee cover) and is great quality. It's a little short so it doesn't cover the bottom, but hey it was free so who's complaining. would have recieved 1 star, but I'm very satisfied with the way things were handled on their end!"

These short are lengthy and go around to your knees, unlike other dazzle shorts that fit above the knees.BTW, the black is truly black on these shorts, not light black, they reflect light like silk or satin. Also the picture doesn't show, but there's a draw string within the inner side of the short's waist band, giving the outside a simple look."

195547,2,"This product has a fatal flaw which causes it to leak your beverage.SIGG touts its ""2nd lid,"" which is basically an upper chamber (grey plastic part) that has two tiny holes which allow steam to rise into the that chamber. The problem is, once your coffee steam rises up, it then cools and condenses into a big puddle of coffee, and then leaks its way out of the upper lid (small metal top part).Am I the only one who sees this? This thing leaked all over my bag. The upper chamber is not sealed against leaks (the lower main bottle portion seals just fine).I can't return it now, so I'm going to seal up those two tiny holes to prevent liquids from getting into the upper chamber.Disappointing, that the feature they trumpet about (upper chamber has relief holes to prevent vacuum sealing of the bottom) is the one that kills this product."
223181,0,"The only thing I have to compare this to is a cheapy $8 one I had from Kmart many years ago. This Sigma 1606L has many more features including cadence which I use often. The data it collects per trip ( average speed, average cadence, max speed, trip time, trip distance) is saved so I can transfer it to a spreadsheet to track how I'm doing. It's easy to remove from it's base using a bayonet style attachment, which I have placed on the handlebar stem. I was not impressed when I saw how the parts mount to the bike, thin rubber O-rings loop around sensor and fork, or baseplate and stem to stay in place, but after 1000 miles on streets and bike paths everything has held together. It always shows current speed plus any other selected single feature, like cadence or time.Why only 3 stars?1) Lacks a scan feature, so I must push a button repeatedly to get to view the function I want. An auto scan feature would allow me to keep my hands on the grips where they belong.2) The wiring is somewhat flimsy. Small gauge wire is subject to breaking if put under any stress.3) Speed readout shows only the closest half mile interval, doesn't show tenths. For example, it reads either 12.0 MPH or 12.5 MPH missing 12.1, 12.2,etc.I am actually very happy with this nicely designed and low cost unit. Mine came with a second mounting for a second bike, data for which it tracks separately. After 8 months of use over many miles, it has served me well."

505824,2,"After reading many positive reviews on other sites, I ordered this product for our barn...of two horses. It didn't do a think to alleviate our fly problem. However, since starting on this product two months ago my horses coats are extremely shiny. So that's a positive.Will I order it again for that? No, but they do look very nice next to other horses at shows."
155959,0,"I love the double seam because I have issues with seams that ride up uncomfortably. I've purchased all colors of these and in a few different sizes. The red medium is the same as the large white (women's). The blue and black mediums are smaller than the large white/medium red. These do not have a cotton crotch and the material is very thin, like pantyhose (in fact, they run easily and have to be treated delicately and washed in detergent without any bleach whatsoever), so they leave absolutely nothing to the imagination. I don't recommend getting these too tight, especially if you're riding a bike because they are so thin that as you bend over, there's no privacy whatsoever. Again, they are very comfortable and I love them, but I wish the material were more durable. They are priced correctly, I think."
46177,1,"I understand those who want more, but goodness gracious with 182 cuts, this is a great set. And while I agree the Sam Spence material is the best, most of the other music is very good and worthy of inclusion in a set that claims to span 40 years of NFL Films music. I really have no complaints with the set except the lousy CD packaging which at best is hard to use and at worse scratches the CDs. But the music is stellar. Finally. It feels great to have these songs at last.One odd thing...some of the tracks, for example ""Touchdown Jubilee,"" that were originally in stereo on the LPs are now in mono on the CD. Why??? Really bugs me because that track is one of my favorites."

242318,0,"I didn't understand Kennon's review. I read his review of a ""real"" BOSU ball and he was very happy with that. He mentioned there that he had trouble inflating the ball. I had trouble too, until I inserted the inflation needle all the way. Then the air went in easily.Kennon said it started falling apart on the 2nd use. I wish he had described what broke because the ball easily holds me at 197 lbs and looks well engineered. The exercise bands were a nice feature, first they are very handy, second, the bands help beginners with balance. Three stars because a $200 BOSU (exercise videos not included) is better."
408889,1,"I purchased the stand after having the 552 dumbbells for a week. I am doing P90X and found it difficult keeping up with the video with the dumbbells on the floor (and also worry about lifting them off the floor and hurting my back). The stand makes it much easier and quicker to change the weight values and get back into position. The stand is really at the perfect height for me (I am 5'10"" tall). I am impressed with how solid and sturdy the thing is. It doesn't budge when you drop the dumbbells on it.I am the type of person who hates putting things together. I must say, in all honesty, it was very easy to put together. I read a few reviews before I ordered it and was dreading the process. I felt like the instructions were clear and all the holes were properly drilled. It took me about an hour to assemble it."
187796,2,"I recently purchased this bike for my 70 plus year old mother that had knee surgery not long ago. The assembly was fairly simple with the help of a friend, although you need to be very careful tightening the bolts for the front fender since the head of the bolt cracked off after very little torque from the socket wrench.What I was most disappointed about is that the bike is very unstable. I have never owned a adult 3 wheel bicycle, but this was definatly not made to drive on anything but flat surfaces with little grade. My mother almost drove hers into the ditch after several attempts riding it on a slight grade. The seat springs are very weak making the stability issue more prevailant. Also, for an aluminum framed bike it is quite heavy due to the rear axel being quite heavy.I really wanted to like this bike. In the end it is sitting in her shed soon to be added to craigslist."
235174,1,This was a gift for my dad. It was much smaller than I thought but my dad needed a small knife to carry around and this one ended up being perfect. He loved it. It looked good and the craftsmanship was very good for made in China. Better than the Schrade Old Timer for sure.
80677,0,I was pleased with the sturdiness and overall construction of hanger but problem came with type of bike I have. My bike is a hybrid. A cross between a street and mountain bike. Even though it has an aluminum frame. It still has some wt. I could not hang the bike off the floor as instructed which is fine since I was only looking for space in my room. I live in an apt. with plaster walls (another problem). Get good wall anchors (don't use what is included) and be careful how thick the plaster when hanging on outside wall (before you go through plaster to brick wall). I also found getting my tire into hanger difficult once vertical. So if you have a bike like the picture (i.e. a light racing bike) great. But if a serious one. Be warned. May not work as advertised.

204410,1,"We have 4 of these: 2 are about 2 years old and 2 are just over a year old. They used to come with a replacement for both sides of the straw itself, and we have yet to use any of them. The instructions on mine say that it should not be put in the dishwasher and harsh chemicals should not be used when washing. Yes, it is harder to clean than a regular cup, but IMHO it is easier to clean than any flip top straw cup or leak proof sippy cup I have seen. The key is to rinse it once you get home.The great thing about these is that they keep fluid cold a very long time, and they don't leak if closed properly. Add 4-5 ice cubes to your cold drink and it will keep it cold for 5-6 hours inside a sitting car on a hot summer day. Also, I'd rather have my kids' drinks sitting in stainless steel than plastic."
463486,0,"sure, full tang, but not full width tang, so it has been known to be prone to breaking at the base of the blade, esp. when prying. also, a bit short for baton-ing decent sized small logs; another inch or two of blade would probably be ideal. the clip point is terrible for batoning because it is sharp enough to get stuck into the baton. the top part of the guard HAS to come off if you want to use it for survival. i wrapped paracord around the handle because it was a bit too small for my average hands. also, i'm not so sure that the scandi grind that this knife has is best for splitting wood or chopping, and it is definitely inferior for other tasks. I'm now looking at other knives to replace this one in my camping gear. I'll probably get a mora triflex for for small tasks, and maybe a rat 7 or an esee 6 for the big stuff if i can justify the expense..."
435616,1,"This a a great pack, Osprey does well with their packs. Also I use this for carry on for travel. Slides under seat. The only thing I would get a large size, I broughtthis on close out and all they had was medium. It fits but adjustments are set @ largest fitting."

226427,0,"I work at a sedentary job, so I bought this to put under my desk to use during long periods when I cannot get up. I'm already an active person, so it's not really for fitness, but just to keep my legs moving during the day. It works well, but is practically impossible to use at a desk because you can't do it without hitting your knees. So basically, I'm getting a lot less use out of it than I would like. It's a nice product to use in front of the TV, but may not be the best option if you want to use it under your desk."

It arrived as promised and the name plate was mounted for me. I was very impressed with the quality and speed of service. I had no trouble assembling it. In fact, it was very simple. The hooks were large enough to manipulate easily. The display proudly hangs on her bedroom wall. Dutch Touch Creations...you did the job perfectly!!! Thank you!!!!"
360436,2,I bought this item for my husband because he is an AVID Bengals fan. The cup leaks and he doesn't use it. It would cost more to return it for a new one than the cup is worth. Disappointing because I love the design of the city on the cup. :o(

382609,0,"I sat on this review because I wanted to actually use the forearm guards first. They do what they are supposed to do, which is protect my forearms while I perfect my cleans and snatches. However, I've noticed that I have to stop periodically to take the forearm guards off and dry them off AND dry off my wrists because my forearms become very sweaty, so much so that the sweat dripped down onto my palms while I was in the middle of a set of swings. Anyone who works with kettlebells regularly will tell you that sweaty hands are not what's hot. For now these will do, but I may end up purchasing a different set of forearm guards to see if those prevent my forearms from getting so sweaty."
175242,0,"I just bought this and I can't say that it with worth the $50+ that I spent for it. It hasn't come in too helpful for repairing my bike's crank and removing the freewheel. When it arrived, I realized that I wasn't buying very many tools. I wish I had just spent $5 or $10 on the individual Park Tools specific for my job. I might add that I have primarily early 1980's bicycles - just to let you know how my opinion is biased."

363992,0,"The problem with these is that the liner inside fits in a way that the crotch of the exterior of the shorts rides really low, and creates an unattractive pouch in the front, like you are hiding some kind of accident in your pants. I don't know about you, but when I spend money on workout clothes, I expect them to be functional, but I don't think it's too much to expect them not to look weird. Other than this, the quality of the materials is great, so if you by chance have a body type that can wear these a bit better, I would recommend trying them on in the store first to make sure, which unfortunately kind of defeats the convenience of online shopping."
497638,0,"When I first got this, I was disappointed. It's just a folded piece of sheet metal, with a non-stick coating. The price was high, considering what the product is.However, it's a great convenience, and it protects the floors and carpets from scratches and dents. I begrudgingly recommend this item if you have powerblocks."
61358,2,"I own four of these bottles so I know when I say that these bottles are not as good as the hype. No matter what you're doing, nobody wants to kill themselves sucking water through a straw. The bite valve is also exposed and gets dirty really easy, especially when backpacking or hiking, and it's tough to clean. It also leaks everywhere if it's turned upside down, even if the valve is closed. Check out the Contigo Autoseal water bottles, they're cheaper, won't leak, are much handier and don't take the effort of sucking through a stupid straw. Camelbak I love you guys but this bottle sucks."
92297,1,I purchased the gazelle edge at the begining of February. I wanted something that would help me lose weight and that was easy to store. And the price was right. It has been a month that I have been using it 40 minutes every day of the week. Haven't seen any weight loss yet. It does give me a workout. It seems to me that this is a product that is going to take a while to see results. So it isn't a fast system to lose weight. And it is easy to store. It closes up and is perfect leaning against the wall for storage. I gave it four stars because I haven't seen any results yet. It is really easy on your knees too. I have noticed alot of strain on my feet and ankles though. But I would imagine that it would be rough on your feet and ankles with a tread mill too. I would suggest wearing supportive running shoes with the use of this. Hurts your feet without any shoes. It's really quiet too. I use it in the living room while watching television. It makes time go by faster. I just hope it helps me lose weight!
252062,2,"I like the VistaPix imaging spotting scope, but my short experience with it does suggest some improvements are needed: (1) As with many imaging systems, the digital camera is attached to the side and does not take advantage of the large direct-view lens itself. Also, (2) the lens is a fixed focus, not a variable telescopic lens. (3) When one has to focus the VistaPix, you focus looking at the digital display and a vertical bar on that display, trying to get a number and heighth of the vertical bar as large as possible. The numbering scheme on the vertical bar doesn't seem to make sense: sometimes the number is in the low 100s and sometimes it is in the high hundreds even when the vertical bar is tall. After you have gotten the highest number possible, the camera is supposed to be in focus. (4) Then you have to adjust the eyepiece to focus the direct-view optical lens. A little cumbersome. (5) After I took pictures I found that they were not in sharp focus when downloaded to the PC...close, but not sharp. And you only find out when you download them to your computer! Very frustrating. (6) The VistaPix also eats up batteries very quickly. The manual says that you can use an AC adapter and gives specifications in terms of voltage and amperage, (7) but do not specify a specific Celestron power supply nor does the VistaPix come with one. Frustrating. I have several power supplies from a wide variety of electronic gadgets, but none met the VistaPix power supply specifications. It does come in a metal carrying case (nice) and also with a remote shutter release (for steady shooting--nice). Comes with an SD memory card slot (buy a card, otherwise the internal memory only allows a few pics to be stored...and SD memory cards are cheap). I'm using the VistaPix for birdwatching. Overall, a little disappointed, primarily because of the difficulty in obtaining a sharp focus. Will keep playing with it, but I might recommend looking around before I buy a VistPix."
97671,2,Got a casio wave ceptor watch with metal band for Christmas with the same wrist band design- the band pulled apart at the case the first day. The metal pin that holds the band on is attached to the case with a cheap rubbery plastic peice that rips out easily.The worst part is if you look at Casio's warrentee the band and case are not covered.My watch is now held together with epoxy - very fashionable! Goes good if you have glasses held together with masking tape.My advise is move on and find a watch with a metal to metal connection from the band to the case. Don't buy this one!

132515,0,"Providing battery backup illumination to compensate for reticle washout (the bane of all Reflex-type optics depending upon tritium and fiber optics for reticle illumination) is an excellent idea.Unfortunately, the battery type used is expensive and uncommon, battery life is very poor, the fiber optic collector glows at night when using the battery backup (unless the provided fiber optic collector cover is in place) and the tritium is so dim as to be nearly unusable (supposedly for night vision compatibility).However, I loved the chevron reticle and daytime performance and if Trijicon would brighten the tritium and replace the current battery with a more common CR123 or AA then I'd seriously reconsider it."
159429,0,"I bought 10 different color pair of these gloves. I love all the fun colors, but the gloves showed significant wear after only one time. They looked worse and showed more wear than gloves I've worn for months. The gloves appear to be very thin or weak material. Too bad because I love the fit and the color choices."
481239,0,"It comes with 2 handles (which are nicely rubberized for a sure grip, even if your hands are slippery); to insert or change a blade, you flip up the bolster with your thumb. The nylon case is 6 x 9 x 2 and has lots of Velcro and 2 loops, presumably for your belt; I find it too big and klunky for that, but the loops would probably work on an external pack strap. I just stick in my pack. The blades are firmly seated in the case, but this is actually a problem: it is not easy to take out and put back the blades, and I cut myself a couple of times.It comes with a generous selection of 6 blades: 6 inch chef, 6 inch blunt tip serrated bread (sort of like a short roast beef slicer), 6 inch fillet (which is fairly stiff not flexible enough for fish), 6 inch wood saw (which I have not used), 6 inch carving (which kind of looks like a long-ish steak knife), and a 5 inch utility (which sort of looks like the carving except it is serrated, and is suppose to be an all purpose blade). All knives are marked `Kai' and `China', except the wood saw which is Japanese and came in a paper wrapping with Japanese script.As is, this kit is convenient and cleverly designed. The blades are good quality, roughly the equivalent of medium-priced gourmet kitchen knives. The only 2 blades I ever use are the chef and utility (because the serrations are more aggressive than the bread blade), so it is not as versatile as you might think. My main complaint is that all knives are a rather smallish 6 inches, since they have to fit in the nifty carrying case.As a picnic knife set, it has earned a permanent place in the picnic basket or backpack, since it is a compact, very complete knife kit that can simply be tossed into the pack along with the other picnic supplies. If you have the room, I tend to use one of those plastic luggage things full of cheap knives that include a cutting board."

320986,0,"I bought this coat in both blue and green - after reading the reviews that it does not have side pockets. I bought them at REI as they were on sale for 114.00. The colors are amazing - and on the first day I wore the green one I got compliments from almost everyone I ran into. I skied in it at Breckenridge in sub zero temperatures and it kept me very warm. I just make sure when I wear it I wear something under it that has pockets - ie: A down vest or a hoodie with pockets to keep my phone etc. If running around town it is not as big a deal as I usually have my purse.So as long as you are willing to deal with the no pocket part - it is a really, really cute jacket, very flattering, great colors, and suprisingly warm. However having said all of that I would not buy it unless it is on sale..."
98963,0,"This set is an excellent value (and I got chose free shipping and it arrived the next day!), but I'm not crazy about the chips. As you can see from some of the customer pictures (not the product pictures!), from the side the chips appear white with the color stripes. I would have preferred a chip that looked like the majority of it's color from the side (like in the product pics), instead of the 8 equal sized color sections. And the white and black chips are confusing. The white chips (150 of them) appear black from the side because they are printed opposite of the rest of the chips, and the black chips (50 of them) appear white from the side. Could be better.

This is frustrating as I am freezing while going to the post office to return these things a second time."
311188,2,"Ok, Am seriously ticked. description on website specifically says ""Burris 30mm Tactical Rings"" yes thats plural as in a set. what you get is a single Burris 30mm Tactical Ring "" as in ONE Ring"" as in absolutely useless... If the seller puts the description up, then its a purposeful ripoff and the seller is a sleeze. if Amazon did it they need to buy me another RING and send it and apologize to the seller. you can buy single rings for $22.00 off amazon itself. thought i was paying $40.00 for TWO."

477436,0,"I regretfully hadn't read the worst reviews before clicking the buy now button. Had I, I would have known not to buy the bike through Amazon. I was wary of the decision all week as I waited for the package to arrive.Sure enough, when the box arrived, it appeared as though a pack of angry tigers went at it with teeth and claws.""Okay..."" I thought, ""but it is all taped up, so maybe the insides aren't so bad.""Opening the box, it was clear the bike was not in it's original box. Random styrofoam pieces were just thrown in, but didn't keep stuff from moving around and getting right up against the box walls. Parts were loose, and the bike's computer was in a separate little box that was all torn up. When I pulled it out, the cage surrounding the fan was broken in bits. It looked as though someone punched through the box and hammered the computer.I carefully went through the parts list to make sure everything was there, and it was--in fact I was given additional nuts and bolts that belong nowhere.But it was the condition of the parts that fell below standard. The body of the bike is completely scratched up, and I can't be bothered to pack the 100-lb device and send it back for aesthetic damage. It kinda sucks, though, to have to accept that.The bike does work, even the damaged computer did (just not the fan.) I called Schwinn to have it replaced and they were easy to deal with and helpful. I received a new computer with working fan the next week.I bought the bike to rehabilitate my broken leg. After all my good dealings with Amazon in the past, I thought they could be relied on for quality merchandise conveniently shipped to my door. Apparently, large equipment is not their forte.All in all, the bike is great! But best go to a specialized sports equipment store if you prefer a bike that isn't delivered with broken and scratched up parts."

198039,1,"This knife is bigger than I thought it would be, and yet is flat enough and somehow small enough that when I put it in my front jeans pocket, I don't know it is there. The blade is very THICK, which is really nice, because it also means it is very strong. Workmanship on this knife is excellent. I really like this knife."
488589,0,"This model kit consists of over 100 pieces. The design is very good. Nearly all pieces are of reasonable sizes, so it would have been ideal even for beginners.I say ""would have"" because the manufacturing quality is horrendous. Deformed pieces are common and feathers are everywhere. Trimming and in fact sculpting become a big part of the construction process, easily doubling the work load than had the quality been at Tamiya level.Fortunately, the plastic is soft enough to curve with relative ease. There are no thin wires in the kit, so unlike the case with05038 1/144 U-BOOT TYP VIIC RVL05038, breakage is not a big problem. Fitting large pieces together, however, can be a real struggle. I eventually use a lighter to soften the plastic into the right shape and end up having to buy a second set after ruining the first one. This is obviously not something that young kids should be allowed to attempt.The documentation is weak and error-prone. The guns are not to scale. The design is of dubious historical accuracy. The main guns cannot maintain their elevations. But the main problem remains the poor manufacturing quality. If one can overlook or overcome this issue, the USS Arizona kit is a great project for novice or intermediate modelers."

20584,1,after reading reviews i was a little iffy about buying it..reviews qoted repeatedly that the rail was screwed to the reciver cover and would always comes lose...they must have fixed tat problem cause mine came riveted and solid as a rock...so with that alone made me very happy the second thing was the shipping....A+++++ i paid for standard shippping and 2 days later had it..yes there is some minor mod to be done but for 17 bucks..GROW A PAIR stop complaining and and do a little work.its not a 100 dollar upgrade its not gunna be perfect right out the box...all in all im very happy\\\
362874,1,Great buy. I purchused this jersey for my dad and he loves it. I would reccommend this company to anyone. They had fast delivery and it was just as it was described.

202419,0,"Well worth the $2. But not remotely worth the $7 shipping.From a distance, this tassel is excellent, and its small size functions well for faster movements with the straightsword.But if you look at it closely, it's poorly made; hardly any effort has been made to cover up the bulbous base that forms the shape. The strings over this base are so loose it's just hideous."
195527,0,"I, like many of the folks that gave reviews, was disappointed with the fact that a) the product was Chinese-made instead of Swiss-made, and b) not a ""sippy cup"". I bought mine straight from the Sigg site and there was no mention of the country of origin, so I made an assumption and that's on me. I also assumed that a ""mug"" was something I could drink from on the go. Not the case, as many reviews have said. I haven't had any problems with leaks and the thermal qualities are great. If you want a small thermos, this may very well work for you.I did a modification to the lid (the plastic one in the middle, not the metal cap) to turn it into something I could drink from, if you have a drill (or access to one), you can do the same. I first drilled three small holes at the edge of the lid (drill from underneath so you avoid the seal, etc.) which produced decent flow, so I drilled two more to see what happened (using a 5/64 drill bit). Less flow. Oh yeah, the air vent. Another small hole on the opposite side and back to good flow, but the plastic melts a bit when you drill so I ended up just making a single larger sipping hole. This worked fine for drinking, and so far no leak problems (of course I generally keep it upright, so if you toss it around in a bag, etc. your experience may vary). I'm sure this voids any warranty, and if you choose to do this make sure you wear the appropriate safety gear. I recommend a 1/16 bit for the vent hole and a 1/4 bit for the sipping hole. I also used a Dremel and stiff nylon bristle brush for cleanup of the plastic fray around the holes.I also had the problem of it being loose in the car cup holder, I tried a standard coozie but no luck."

300101,1,"This jacket is very soft and cozy. It is perfect for a chilly day or evening. I purchased 2 as gifts for golfers and I have one myself. They keep you warm, yet still breathe. The soft fleece allows for free range of motion (it does not restrict movement as other jacket material's can). Fit is true to size. I visited the Columbia site to get a more accurate picture of the color since there were 2 different reds. Then came back here to amazon to order. Great jacket!"

I returned the watch to Amazon and received $295.01 of the 299.99 paid. I'm not particularly happy with this but it's not worth fighting for ~$5. I would like to try the 9937 again but it is currently unavailable from Amazon. Maybe others are having a similar issue with the wristband. BTW, like one of the previous reviewers my 9937 also had the ""coin edge"" bezel unlike the picture on Amazon. I too like the coin bezel."

Don't be afraid to pull out the scissors and make small cuts to relieve some of the pinching areas.
489764,2,"Before I start, I have to say ""NBA 2k2"" is still the best Basketball game out there.Ok now, there are just some problems that keep bothering me in NBA 2k3:1) WHERE is YAO-MING??? I know Yao wasn't offically sign with the rocket when this game came out, but can they just place him in the free agent pool instead???2) The controll setpup is TOO complicate, it's true there are more realistic fancy step-up and cross-over moves, but there is no way for your friends to come and enjoy it with you right away.3) WHERE IS THE QUICK Alley-Hoop pass button from the 2k2??? There is no more quick pass button(R2 button on the NBA 2k2), which made the pass so SLOW and so unrealistic even with the complete passing mode ""on"".4) The low-post action ""looks"" better than NBA 2k2, but actually is not! The low-post gameplay feels so fake, just like the ball-passing action. You will see what I meant by it.5) ESPN broadcast gets so annoyed after awhile, can Sega Sport just keep it simple? Why are they keep messing around with those great feature and controlls from 2k2?6) When I finished the season and playoff, I was shocked that the ending scene is exactly the same as NBA 2k2! Therefore, what's the reason to get this game when the roster is not even complete yet? Again, Where is Yao-Ming???At last, I was so disappoint that I pre-order this game, because I trust Sega Sport too much from their great masterpiece ""NBA 2k2"".I really suggest you guys to rent this game before you buy it. ..."
222119,2,"I used this seat post for a few hundred miles of road and gravel trail riding. It was a complete waste of money, and is now relegated to the box of old bike parts in the garage. You will never be able to dial in the exact vertical angle of the seat because the seat wobbles on the post. So you try to get the tilt angle right, then sit on the saddle and it tilts out of position. Which only makes the saddle more uncomfortable on your private parts. In the end I bought a Selle Anatomica saddle on sale almost half off directly from the manufacturer. That saddle is comfortable right out of the box, and gets more comfortable with with use. Because the SA saddle is leather suspension, it cushions bumps better than this seat post. If you think $189 is too expensive for a saddle, then buy one directly from the manufacturer at $99 during their 2012 Christmas sale, or buy a discounted returned saddle. No, I don't work for SA, I'm just a happy customer! There are also more expensive suspension seat posts made by Thudbuster. While I've never tried one, they get great reviews. I have an Avenir Suspension seat post on an old bike, and while it does not cushion bumps as well as the Kalloy, it is better machined, and it doesn't wobble. In the end, there is more to comfort than just a suspension seat post. So read up on bike fit and adjust handle bar position and stem length, saddle height, position and tilt, and be sure you have the right sized frame; or pay your LBS bike fit expert to help you out."
395119,0,"I bought this ice cream maker for my mom for Mother's Day. She loves ice cream and frozen yogurt, mainly yogurt. Her favorite froyo place moved too far away from her and I thought that maybe she'd like to make her own at home. She loves the concept. But the work doesn't seem worth the reward. I could see where it would be useful if we were out camping or somewhere without electricity, though the ice supply most likely wouldn't be plentiful enough. It may be worthwhile if there were more than two people ""tossing"" the ball around--incidentally, comically pretending they're filming an exercise video--to make a paltry amount of the icy treat."
61364,0,"This is a fun water bottle to use. It is easy to unscrew, is wide enough to accept ice cubes, and the bite valve is really a nice idea. This allows you to sip from the straw without having to bend your neck back. A good safety feature if you are driving and can't take your eyes off the road.It comes in a variety of bright colors, (I bought the blue one) and it really looks nice. The bottle, cap, and straw assembly can be cleaned without a problem, and rinsing the bottle regularly keeps it fresh.The one major complaint, and rather misleading advertising statement made by CamelBak about the Better Bottle is this: ""the Better Bottle ...fits in most cup holders.""Only the smaller .5 liter bottle fits, but if you are like most people, you'll opt for the .75 liter bottle, and this bottle *does not fit* most cup holders. I have two cup holder sizes in my car, one for standard sized cups, and one for larger ones, and the Camelbak does not fit the larger size cup holder hole.I find that this statement by Camelbak, ""fits in most cup holders,"" is a misrepresentation of the product. It is an extreme hassle to use this water bottle in the car as there is no where to place it. It falls to the floor of the car and picks up all sorts of lint.This water bottle would have gotten an easy five star rating, but because of the deceptive product description, I cannot fully endorse this product."

Not that they would be successful but when you open carry you attract a lot of attention, good and bad. This holster is secured in your pants via hooks. It is not easy for me to remove the holster and would be possible for a thief. The holster has a mechanism that then locks the pistol into the holster. To remove my weapon they would need to be at the right angle to grab the gun, depress the release and lift the gun up out of the holster. You can't get that level of protection in other holsters. I also like the holster because the angle at which it is carried is adjustable forward and back. Very comfortable to wear. It is the only holster I will every buy for an open carry situation.

I had looked at a razor scooter but liked the fact that this scooters' tires are bigger and safer. Also, I'm 5'9"" so I wanted to make sure the scooter was comfortable for my height either standing as I scoot or sitting as I pedal. Glad I bought the version with the bike pedals as the ride one way is down hill and of course uphill the opposite direction. So - now I use the scooter to glide downhill from building to building and the pedals to go back up hill (a great workout). Easy to put together, great quality product, excellent price. Several of my work friends have now ordered one for themselves. Who says you can't have fun when you are over 40?"
56205,0,"This cycle works great for rehab, but needs to be left to cool before moving. It ships with stickers on it that warn about it heating up and getting hot. I think it needs to be redesigned to not get hot. Putting stickers on it only diminishes the chance of a lawsuit and doesn't fix the problem. It's dangerous for forgetful users that have impaired vision. It is great for an arm workout, but useless for a leg workout on a person with poor leg coordination or foot numbness. I can't give it more than 3 stars because of these points."
266670,1,"Setup is relatively easy but directions were poor. Easy to use when shooting alone. Effortless resetting the arm, Very accurate, solid parts. Makes shooting alone fun.

I often end up jumping in friends' cars or heading up the tram to go snowshoeing, so it's a big plus to have all of my gear in one compact place."

43727,0,"I have used the Windline on dive boats over the years and the center column and cross bars works very well.For my own dive boat I bought the better built Garelick dive ladder instead. The Garelick dive ladder has a broader step that does a much better job of supporting your foot when all you have on is a neoprene bootie and or a swim fin and are standing on the ladder. The Garelick also has a foam inner core so if you drop the ladder it floats. The Garelick dive ladder has a white coating that has held up for more than 15 years of regular use. I doubt that the ""electro polished"" finish of the Windline will last as long.Overall both are better boarding ladders for divers or waterskiers than the traditional boarding ladders. Highly recommend with any ladder that you try it out on calm waters and with people around to give you an assist if needed rather than wait until it is a sink or swim proposition."

This one looked to be what I needed at a reasonable cost. Like another review stated, there are some loose threads that pop up every time I wash it. Don't know how long it'll last, but I don't plan on wearing it much longer. The material has a very open weave. This can lead to occasional snags. Even after several washings the material is still a little scratchy. The waste band is nice. It doesn't roll or bunch up. Overall it does it's job, I just wish it was a little softer."

It's backed by what seems to be no more than thin pressboard. In addition, it mounts by hanging off of your dartboard. Good or bad, I don't know. But you'd better make sure that your board is in the wall pretty securely if you're going to hang this extra weight off it."
86157,0,"I have not use the belt, so I don't know how it would fit. My purpose to get this belt is mainly for the material. Since I didn't like the rubbery material, I didn't use it to make the support belt for my mom."

31756,0,"Received the lock , but there were no instructions inside to tell how to change the lock code. I can't find anywhere online to give instructions either. Any help would be great. That said, the lock is ok. We used it just with the provided factory lock code, but the cord does not retract very well. You have to mess with it to get it back in."
16885,0,"My kids are ages 5 and 6.5 and they both love this bike. I bought one for each and they whiz around in them. I like the flag for when we are on the sidewalk, for safety reasons, and they just think its cool. The 2 downsides which I had read before I purchased them were 1) They do not go uphill easily. Our driveway slopes and the kids have to walk it up. 2)The back seat rest is very uncomfortable + hurts their back. My 6.5 year old just removes it, but if it is cold outside, a large jacket seems to cushion it. Overall, for the price, I would have bought it again. The kids really do like it."
121122,2,"I bought this collar for my little peekapoo puppy who is named after the old New Orleans Saints mascot. He is barely 5 pounds and was able to break the clasp with his teeth. I can understand a big dog able to do that..but not my tiny puppy. It was cute while it last, but that wasn't long at all. :("

358863,0,I let my ten year old open this Christmas gift early because of the blizzard.She was ecstatic. Unfortunately her glee soon turned to despair. After an hour or so of playtime both handles on one side of the sled broke off on her way down the hill.I felt badly that her Christmas toy was broken and it wasn't even Christmas yet.
115506,1,"I bought these gloves many months ago for riding bike in rainy Portland, Oregon weather. Today, in November 2012, I finally got to test them. Excellent water, cold, and wetness protection! I finally found my rainy biking gloves! Previously, I used those rubber or plastic (green) garden gloves. They were almost instantly wet inside because my palms are very sweaty and the garden gloves' lining was almost non-existent. Once gloves got wet inside, my hands would freeze even in mild weather. But THESE gloves, Atlas SB460, have excellent lining that wicks away any moisture. At the end of my 1-hr bike ride my hands were dry and warm despite the downpouring rain! I was very surprised. This prompted me to write so that other people with wet palms know about these superb gloves."
50811,1,"My son tried several models of Kettler, as well as an Italtrike and a few other upscale models, before choosing the all-American (by way of German-born engineering) Schwinn Roadster as his 3rd birthday present. (He also prefered it to the wooden two-wheeler toddler bike he already had.) My husband agreed when he saw how cheaply the Kettler models were made (ironic, given their pricing), using bolts that didn't seem to fit right and having just loads and loads of plastic parts.A surprise and a relief on our pocketbook (those upscale models don't come cheap!) But this little Schwinn has held up well over the last year, whether it's out in the driveway or on the neighborhood roads, or parked outside in the heat and the elements. Even the color still looks good; even the laminate(?) wood(?) footboard on the back is still shiny. Even the much-abused tires only need occasional pumping. (So far, we have not had to replace the tires, but when that time comes it seems easy enough to find replacements.) This is a well-made little tricycle that steers well and drives well. The long, low, padded handlebars (longer and lower and more padded than those of the Kettlers he tried) are good and comfy for little hands. The included bell is not just fun, but an important safety feature. (We tricked out the trike further with extra reflectors, a headlamp, a brakelight, and a mirror -- just like Daddy's!)While there is no pushbar for us to help push on longer excursions, neither parents nor kiddo seem to mind. The most we do is give him a little push from the footboard, and off he goes. The fact that our son always has to use his own power to move his tricycle seems to give him more independence and more of a sense of his own physical limits. Indeed, thanks to this nice little trike, I've come to re-think the need for the pushbar altogether.The ONLY thing I wish this trike had, but doesn't, is a seat belt. (The seat belt was a major draw for the Kettler and the Italtrike.) That said, I haven't been able to track down information on whether a seat belt is warranted or even safe for tricycles...PARENTS - DON'T FORGET TO BUY A HELMET WITH YOUR CHILD'S FIRST TRIKE/BIKE!"

216564,1,"Purchased this on a whim, for our family campout. This griddle is the best! Breakfast for 7: eggs, bacon, and large pancakes - try to have you stove somewhat level before you drop an egg on the griddle. The cooking surface is the size of the entire stove, and the non-stick surface is very easy to clean. The legs are designed to ""grab"" the wire rack on the stove, so it doesn't slide around. This thing is great. I wish it had a protective case."
396698,0,"I figured I was taking a gamble on this knife when I ordered it for a couple reasons: Riveted pillars and pivot pin don't allow for any adjustment of the knife whatsoever, and obviously you can't inspect your exact knife before you order it to make sure it's put together decently. Well, I guess I was right to be leery. The pivot is WAY too tight and can't be adjusted, the blade is so uncentered that it nicks and rubs the plastic handle when it closes (again, can't be adjusted), the thumb hole is tiny so my thumb can't get a good bite on it, and the edge grind was horrifyingly uneven and was actually ROLLED 3/4 the lengh of the blade. I've got more sharpening equipment than I know what to do with so the edge could have been an easy fix, but I still can't forgive that lack of quality control, particularly since the rest of the knife is also completely unsatisfactory.I've got 4 other Spyderco's, 3 of which were ordered from internet retailers assuming the same risk of receiving a lemon, but they are all perfect. This is the first let down Spyderco's ever given me. Returning this knife."
173682,0,"The vest seems sturdy and I feel safe with my daughter in it. She wears it when in a boat. It does not fit her comfortably, although I am guessing most life jackets wouldn't fit babies well since they are little and vests are bulky. Her arms cannot come together while in it. The top squeezes and pushes on her neck. she is 20#/29inches. I have to hold her in a reclined position when she wears it because she isn't able to sit comfortably even in a baby seat since it is bulky."

173152,0,"I ordered this trailer in silver and blue, but green arrived instead. I was REALLY dissapointed... BUT seeing as how returning & purchasing a new color moght be costly & time consuming, I got over my initial dissapointment & kept the green. the overall quality is as I expected. I shopped around and dispite the other reviwers complaining about fabric quality, I've never seen a better fabric on any trailer. I could be wrong, but I suspect complaints are due to unreasonable expectations, heavy use or poor care. the fabric feels like a nylon blend, excessive sunlight and skin oils will accelerate degradation. at the very least, you should never leave this iten to sit outside unprotected & unoccupied. with proper care, this trailer should last you at least a couple years, depending on the weight you put in it.also, the seatbelts look strong enough but I wouldn't put too much trust in them. I like the side pockets and small 'trunk' space behind the seat. installation will be easy if you have the right tools.I didn't have the tools so I took the trailer to a nearby bike shop where they installed it free.overall, I'm happy with my purchase. I'm only REALLY only dissapointed I didn't get the color I wanted.update: as of the year 2010, my trailer, having been used, secured & stored indoors... is still in perfect working order."

457930,1,"I bought this paddle to replace a Stiga that I'd been playing with. I've found the Carlos Chiu to have a very high spin capacity, living up to why I bought it. I played 19 games straight with it and was consistently pleased with the spin it put on the ball. On more than one occasion my opponent swung and completely missed the ball due to the spin.The only real negative I've found with it is that it is heavier than my previous paddles."
509289,0,"After using the usual pips out hard paddle, i was starting to want to up grade to the more intermediate kind of bats. i realized that the better players where i played in college were using them. i bought the sweeris and realized it was a lot different then the run of the mill hard paddle. getting used to it was easy, and i was then able to get my game to a higher level. I honestly think though that do to the sweeris not having as much offense as it does defense, turned me into a more defensive player. just remember when looking at different paddles that this one is definately a defensive paddle. if you are a begginer i would recommend getting it though. i feel it is worth the money, and also worth it if you feel that you are leaning more towards defense. as cool as this sounds i used to call this paddle excalibur! BUTTTTTT now that i use my friends carlos chui, i call that paddle nexcalibur. there is no comparrison between the 2. the sweeris is for defense, and the chui is for offense. i also have used a bunch of paddles from butterfly, but these 2 are my personal favorite. i have been playing for probably only 4-5 years now, and its been a while since i used the sweeris. i am only writing this message to pay homage to a great defensive paddle. hope this helped someone."
409414,1,"I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets. It fits well, so it should be comfortable when layering.

Went through all the set up, did my walking for the day and was ready to hook it up to my computer. The software does not download to a MAC!!!!! I can't believe the manufacturer wouldn't have software compatible for a MAC! What a waste of time and money. Their download information states I can manually enter the data into their program. Are you kidding me?????? What a waste. I'm probably going to send this thing back. It's useless to me. Amazon needs to state the software is not compatible with a MAC since OMRON keeps it a secret until it's too late!!!Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software"

443395,0,"I ordered a size large, but they appeared to be more like an x-large to xx-large. If you like your capris to fit more like sweatpants - then these are for you, but if you prefer something that doesn't make you look 10 pounds heavier - order a few sizes smaller or a different brand alltogether."
347205,0,"I purchased these diving fins to replace a pair of U.S. Divers skin diving fins with the same colors. I did see the fins were for Scuba, but I assumed there would be a heel cushion like the ones I'd worn out. Sorry, no cushion. If you wear a wetsuit with booties, I suppose you wouldn't need a cushion. However, I swim in my pool without the wetsuit, so I needed the cushion. I concluded that I bought the wrong item. A better photo on the website would have told me about the rear strap better and I wouldn't have made the error in ordering.If I was still scuba diving, I'd still prefer my old black ScubaPro fins over the U.S. Divers model.- ET"
454246,0,"I have owned several PreCip jackets. The are a great jacket for the price. They keep you dry, are relatively light, and compact down. My problem with this particular purchase was that the size was not as advertised. I ordered a Men's small and received a unisex small which is a bitter smaller than the advertised Men's size. The result is a jacket that is tighter than my previous jackets. As I was leaving on a trip to Alaska I did not have time to return it. The jacket got 5 weeks of use in Alaska and came out great. Nice product but check the size."

I had ordered a smaller hoodie back at Christmas and found the same problem so I thought if I ordered a larger one I wouldn't have that problem---i was so wrong. The sweatshirt itself is a good fit, but when you try to pull the hoodie up it doesn't fit-and no, I do not have a big head:)."

372273,0,"When I bought this shirt it seemed pretty sweet, however, after one washing (cold water, delicate dry) it shrank two inches in length in the body and about an inch in the sleeves. Fortunately I bought it for work so it is not that critical, but it is now definitely too short. I would recommend instead the Russell Athletic Men's Dri Power Crewneck Sweatshirt. Super sweet and warm, and no shrinking..."
497878,1,"Yep, these actually do dry very quickly. Probably only 2 or 3 hours max to dry. Also, these things feel great. They're way more comfortable than my usual cotton Hanes underwear. I might even switch to using these daily."
376157,0,I took off a star because the stand doesn't include the mini hook you see in the picture. The instruction and box only have 4 hooks so the picture is probably a earlier or newer build than the one shipped to me.I'm not using anchor since that would defeat the purpose of me buying this in the first place. I live in an apartment and didn't want to drill holes in the wall. I find the stand very stable and see no signs of it tipping over. The biggest problem I had was with my bike being oddly shaped. Trying to figure out a way to hang the thing was a pain. I'm not sure what the part is called but I have it hanging from the section between the handle bars and the wheels on the main frame. So my front wheel is up in the air and the bottom wheel is pointing down almost exactly flushed with the stand.I took off another point because the arms have trouble staying in place after you take the bike down. A better way to lock the arms would be great. I imagine if I had a better way on hanging the bike this wouldn't be a issue. I might by arm that people use for female bikes to hang on a car rack. You attach it to the seat and handle bars so you have a straight piece to hang the bike.I found the stand fairly lite and easy to move around. I moved it at least 5 times now trying different positions. The thing is also pretty tall so you can get your bike high up if you want. If you only have one bike you might have problems with the stand shifting when you remove the bike. You might want to put something heavy on the other hooks to weigh it down. At first I had the stand behind a couch with the feet under it to keep it in place but lifting the bike over the couch was a pain which I should have considered before hand.All in all it is a ok stand.

137123,1,"This is a great tool tote. I've looked at lots of them in stores, and owned a few, and this one is definitely my favorite. There are lots of different sorts of pockets and compartments, and tools are held securely while still being easily visible. The material and stitching look very sturdy, and after using it for several months, I don't see anything wearing out or coming apart. The zippers are very heavy-duty and slide easily. It has a solid base and doesn't slump or fall over even with a lot of heavy tools in it."
418770,1,"This is a solid training aid, assuming that the issues you have with your swing fall in line with what the Medicus addresses. A big area it helps is to build a solid one-piece takeaway. It also helps with casting from the top. Lastly, it can be helpful with evening out tempo, since we all aren't born with a smooth swing like Sam Snead. It doesn't take the place of good instruction, particularly video analysis, but for a simple training aid, it does do a pretty good job. I've found that a few of my swing flaws don't trigger the Medicus to break down, but my takeaway and tempo are generally pretty good. A key is to make sure you're not manipulating the swing unnaturally just to keep the club from breaking at the hinge."
455059,2,"I found it impossible to get a reliable signal from the beltto the monitor. Despite belt adjustments and wetting the padsdata was intermitant, with zero being the most frequent reading.Also the display digits were small and I found them hard todiscern while exercizing."
258376,0,"This ""speed loader"" does not seem to be very speedy if you have to wiggle it to get the rounds in the cylinder. When I tried just putting it in straight, it didn't work. If I wasn't doing it right and have to wiggle it to get it in, then it's really not much of a ""speed loader"". It's suppose to be fast, but it doesn't seem that fast to me. Maybe I just need some practice with it, but it's not what I thought it would be. Maybe it's better than just using your hands to put the rounds in one by one, especially in an emergency, but it's still too slow if you needed the rounds in in a split life-saving second. Plus, an accidental inadvertent twist of the knob and you lose all your rounds. Maybe I'll stick with my failure-proof semi-automatic pistol with spare 10-round magazines in a real emergency."

I'm still happy I purchased this item, but it is tissue thin.If you're looking for a really thin gi jacket (for say, summer), I'd recommend this one. I would not say it would last 30 seconds at Judo as tt doesn't seem to be built to take punishment. As a light weave that is to be expected, but when this takes ""light"" to a new meaning...So far it has survived a couple washings (and a little abuse, so it isn't completely fragile) and it makes a nice break when my main gi is a little too ""fragrant"" to wear between laundry days, but I wouldn't recommend this one as a replacement for a heavier weave top!"

391467,1,This product was as good as it was advertised. I am sure it works as advertised however it would not function properly for me.

If you are going to get this, I recommend that you buy some protective gear: things, gloves, etc.All in all, it served its purpose, I just needed hot water.

237954,1,"The Sigg water bottle, 1.0L is fantastic. First opening the product, it smelled like it just came out of the factory, so it needed some thorough washing on the inside before usage (as instructed). I used the Sigg washer which worked perfectly as well, I highly recommend it as a complementary item.As for function, the water bottle is highly durable, lightweight, and great at keeping your drink surprisingly cold for a while. It has awesome capacity, perfect for going hiking and being outdoors. However, if you plan on carrying it around with you all day at work or school, I suggest going with a smaller size -- the 1.0L is slightly big for those uses.If you drink a lot of water (which you should), or if you don't have too many opportunities to refill this, it is a great size to have.This water bottle has a protective lining so still water doesn't wind up tasting like aluminum or plastic (like some other products will do). I do recommend getting a Brita pitcher to purify tap water. Sometimes tap water is a little odd tasting."
383767,1,"I love this suit, I can exercise in half the time now and the price was excellent! My doctor has only arthorized me to exercise for 30 minutes a day since I have asthma, arthritis in my joint and herniated disk in my neck and can only exercise for about 15 minutes before my chest tightens and I'm in servere pain. To top it all off I am anemic and when I exercise to long I can risk passing out. As you can imagine, that makes exercising with any results.....basically a MIRACLE! But with this sauna suit I have lost five pounds so far. That may not be much to most but for about 2 weeks of working out only for about 15 minutes for either 2 or 3 days each week. I think that is excellent results, and I don't feel tired nor am I in any pain from exercising anymore. I DON""T REGRET THE PURCHASE AT ALL!! Using this suit has inspired me to stick more to the diet the doctor gave me, so far both are working for me!I do have a couple of suggestions...1: Get a size bigger than you are the suit will stick to your body (I'm 5ft 9in and about 225pounds now this suit was tight but it fit)...2: Get a xl,xxl that will fit better if your a big person like me...3: The suit can tear so be very careful when you take it off....4: You might have to take the suit off in the tub (yeah you might sweat that much)...5:Drink plenty of water everyday even when not using the suit.THEY SHIPPED SO FAST AND THE PRICE WAS PERFECT FOR ANYONE ON A BUDGET!!!!

235306,2,"What was shipped is NOT what is pictured on the Amazon site. A wast of time. I had to contact the company to find out they where out of stock, a lot of time wasted and then when it arrived, it was the wrong item, NOT EVEN CLOSE to what is pictured. Very disapointed!"
156688,0,"Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase, not euphoric about it.The ball-chair is best when fully pumped with air. You can feel your core muscles flex as you sit. When it loses air, I tend to slouch.Chair isn't so good on carpet and you have to inflate it at least once a week. Chair's shouldn't need this much maintenance, so if you're up for pumping it up, this *might* be for you."
198898,0,Pedometer is a extremely sensitive - so it over counts steps. The rest of the watch is excellent.

174888,1,"Great Scope for the price, looks great on Grandson's Ruger 10/22 with SS barrel. Scope was very easy to sight-in and in less than 10 rds was, hitting small targets a 100 yrs."
168999,1,"Actually I was a bit concerned when the package with the hoist and cords was kind of small. Then you figure out that you have to install two 2x6's and 8 to 10 lag screws. Its a two person install to make it easy. There is some cord calibration involved, but its not as complex when the first time you set it up with someone else helping you. This raises my 100 lbs or so hardtop for my 1970 Toyota FJ40. It works impressively well. Now, I can switch my hardtop to a soft canvas top (which I keep on a Kobalt overhead storage in the garage), or just go naked without a top. It makes the removal and install a one man job. I'm very happy with it. Read the instructions well, most of the work goes in the planning as to what exactly you want to hoist, what is the travel distance, and where your rafters are."
268385,0,"so far this order has been a bad experience. free shipping always seems to take forever, what's worse is the wait and then receiving the wrong item. i cannot comment on the kydex sheath because i didn't receive it yet. probably still on it's way from taiwan. yes, can you believe that. it use to be that owning a sog was like having a piece of art work, no more. the pentagon i ordered looks great at a glance, but looking (not even closely) at it you can see buffing imperfections on the guard and minor pitting on the blade. i will keep it anyway because i will carry and use it daily, and the price was right (thank you amazon). if i had paid full price or was a collector, it would have been sent back. it feels like it will be a good work knife and hold an edge. but, remember the old sogs."
422141,0,"We purchased this for our two boys (ages 7 and 11). They like it a lot. They use it for punching and kicking (they both take karate). The only problem with it is that the base where you fill in the water has started to leak (after 2 days). It apparently comes with a repair kit, which should have told us something about its durability I guess! We have yet to see if the repair will hold or not..."
43253,2,"For birdwatching, I prefer a vest with as many large, USABLE pockets as possible. Unfortunately, this vest has too many small pockets that are more decorative than usable. After I bought this one, I bought the Big Pockets brand and it is far superior for my needs."
106992,1,"I received the hat in 4 days and the quality is good. Husband loved his aniversary gift but it fit a little funny. He has a boat load of other one-fit hats, but this one seemed a little off. Still, he wears it and enjoys it. Maybe it just need to be broken in."
128918,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
491034,1,"To save space and money, I decided to buy this pump in place of a floor pump and separate portable pump. It works great! It will take my tires up to 90 psi without too much effort.

They offered me options and were professional and friendly throughout the process. They happily returned my money and even wrote me an email after to ensure I was satisfied!!! You can't get this kind of customer service anymore....I highly recomend this company, especially if unsure of your purchase. You won't be diappointed!!!!"
436447,0,"I was surprised that the pegs are not secured into the bases - this is clearly to be able to pkg it all flat into a convenient tote bag. But for the young kids I purchased this for (19mos & 3 yrs) having the separate pieces just made the pegs into instant microphones, suckers, and xylophone sticks! They never touched the rope rings - they were thrilled with the pegs w/the big balls on the ends! So, they liked it, they asked to play with it-and its no problem for me they played with it differently than it's intended purpose. It was a success as far as we are concerned!"
381246,0,"At the price, which at the time I purchased it from Amazon, was about 50% less than retail, this pedometer is reliable. It falls from the clip easily; use the attached safety clip to insure that you don't lose it. Software had to be reinstalled; the software kept referring to the blood pressure unit, which is not a part of this item. Appears reasonably accurate, altho these items are not meant to be rocket science. Gives a general summary of walking effort. Prefer this mechanism to the ""pendulum"" devices that are generally cheaper, though some are as much or more than the cost of this item."
149009,0,"I was looking for substitutes for the Russell Athletic non-pocket Pro Cotton Tees that seem to have disappeared off the face of the earth in my size (2XT). These are more expensive by about $3 (and way more than basic XXL's from Russell Athletic) so I was expecting better.The material is very thin and retains creases. Breathability is about the same as the heavier pro cotton but the fit isn't as elegant. The collar and sleeve trim is about the only thing separating the t-shirt from a bargain-basement 3-for-$10 t-shirt.The Pro Cottons are also better at wicking sweat off if you're active. These seemed to repel liquids which is great if you drop water on the outside, but leave you feeling wet if you're sweating inside them.I wouldn't mind getting them if their price reflected their material quality. With the oversize Pro Cotton T's at $12 and regular Pro Cotton T's under $6, I'd probably find $5-$7 a better price for these, and they'd do better sold as a 3-pack for $15."
244016,0,Good value for the price. Size shrinks slightly and need to keep this in mind when ordering a snug fit.

51926,0,"these are nice ""classic"" soccer shorts. beware: these are extremely short, to a point where they can't be worn without a compression short or something like that below. they are very nice to run in and i would recommend them to people looking for a light, cool, soccer short to wear above compression shorts."
56668,2,"First and foremost I'll say that these are possibly the worst airsoft goggles I've ever used. The lens fogs up way too easily and too fast. Not exaggerating- at times, it only takes about ten seconds to fog up to the point where you can only make out basic shadows. I do not recommend these to anyone. That plus the rubber frame doesn't hold onto the lens very well. Poses a possible serious hazard if you're playing against other people."
318956,2,"On the plus side, the watch is easy to set and seems quite durable. However, the altimeter seems overly sensitive to changes in air pressure. Over the course of a few hours, the reading may rise or fall by 200 feet or more."
234470,2,"I had low expectations when I first bought these oars, but I expected them to last longer than what they did. I took a casual trip around a local lake and the connecting piece on one of the oars cracked within the first twenty minutes. These were basically a complete waste of money since now I must buy a more expensive pair on top of this one to replace that one. Cheap price but very cheap quality also."
50113,0,"This ornament was a gift for my boyfriend, who is a big Seahawks fan. The ornament itself is okay, but the picture is a little deceiving. It's not as shiny as it looks. I also didn't realize it was lighted, you had to hook a christmas tree light into the top for it to light up. When we tried to do that the top of the ornament broke. Overall, it was a lot of work for one ornament! I just wanted a shiny Seahawks ornament that we could use every year. I will probably look for another one."
395862,0,"When I first did this workout I was not fond of it- I was very bored and it did not seem to be tough...but by the second and third time I found myself enjoying the last half of the cardio. It's the first half I tend to make myself get through without falling asleep. She does repeat the combos too much but I am definately sweaty by the end of the cardio. I only did the ball segment once and it was not my cup of tea. The ab section is pretty good. The cardio will take a few times to get down, but it's not too hard to follow. I would say this is a steady state cardio workout- and does work the legs quite a bit."
430656,1,"Love it Love it Love it! I don't know what people are talking about the clip falling off, it hasn't happened to me. Maybe I got a great one :) But this pedometer is a god sent.

95898,0,"I like the whole pocket idea, it isn't large, but it's supposed to be small and compact. My biggest issue is the bottle. the cap leaks if you don't push it in just right. The screw top closes well and easily, but I'm finding myself testing it before I continue or water will splash all over the place.The hand strap is comfortable, but the reflective tape to tighten it loosens up very easily so I'm constantly having to tighten it. I'd like to try to find a bottle the carrier will fit, but no such luck so far. If I can't, I intend to get something else."
266814,0,"I purchased 4 of this product for different gauge shells. Item was well made, only one problem, I have a size 34"" waist that means 20 inches of excess belt just hangs down. If a loop were attached to take up this excess the problem would be eliminated. Cutting the excess material causes fraying and can only be eliminated by epoxy gluing the cut edge. Adding this loop would make it a 5 star product."
144625,0,I found the measurements to be pretty accurate but I have a lot of trouble opening and closing it. I end up adding 10 steps just trying to get it open. This is probably because the clasp is all plastic and there are some variaions in the plastic. I hope that after using it a bit the clasp will loosen.
167873,0,When I bought this product about a month ago I was a beginner jump roper. I have been practicing with it about 5 days a week for those 4 weeks and have become pretty good to this point. I have noticed that when I began to speed jump the rope by one of the handles started to wear halfway through the leather and is about to break. The rest of the rope has held up well except for the area near the one handle. The friction caused by the handle is tearing the rope. I would recommend the rope for those who do not jump for speed. But since my goal is speed jumping I am currently looking for another rope.
87783,0,"I found this pistol to be pretty good as far as power and accuracy go for this price point. The grips on mine did not fit snugly/tightly and the body of the gun has a tendency to move around in the grips. I looked online and found that many people have experienced this issue. I ended up using bat tape to hold the grips tighter together to lessen the movement of the body in the grips. This is of course cumbersome when you want to change the co2 cartridge. If this is something that you would not consider doing, or if the loose grips are going to worry you, then you would be better off looking at another pistol."
418025,1,This shirt is absolutely beautiful! I would buy this again in a hearbeat. Fits nice event though I not one of those skinny little guys and I am not one of those great big belly guys. The shirt fits nice on a large built person vehicle nicely.
147371,0,When you buy something for survival remember the circumstances under which you expect to HAVE to use it. A cheap &#34;survival knife&#34; is just plain stupid. I bought these to use in disposal conditions like ground sheet or to cover gear. they are fine for that. I did use one as a ground sheet under a gortex bivy sack and it is definitely good for almost one use. The snow and ice wore the silver finish off and made it clear in most areas. It was slippery which is to be expected but did keep the bottom of the bivy sack clean.Item arrived as expected and before the estimated due date.

118366,0,"Got this to setup and leave out for 2 months. Needed it for space and it has lots of it.Its possible to put up with 1 person, but better with 2.The top is 100% screen and the rain fly leaves large air entry ways even when properly secured. The windows are also not the zip type. They have toggles to hold it up which leaves openings for air to flow thru. This makes it difficult to stay warm inside during the cold. I ended up putting a tarp under the rain fly to help retain heat. Even with a Mr Heater portable Buddy heater on Full all night, it was still chilly inside. I might have to get a more than 9k btu heater to properly heat this to a comfortable level in the cold.The biggest letdown so far is the floor. Had a good rain last weekend and i was surprised to see water seeping thru the floor. Even with a tarp under it, water still made its way in. If there was any 1 thing i wish they would have done better with this tent, it would have been a better floor like some of the other tents have. I ended up dragging around a few towels to get the water out after the rain. You could clearly see the water had saturated the floor and came thru it. This was not water that got in via other methods.As for the walls/rain fly in the rain... I got some water seeping thru the door zipper area and some water came in around the bottom parts of the walls as water ran down them all day (not a lot mind you.. but it did happen). The bottom zipper does not flow all the way around so you end up having a possible seepage area where the 2 zippers connect. There is a flap that c overs that area, but that's only good if water doesn't manage to get into it. I don't know how well the rain fly actually protected the tent due to the tarp being under it. But given that the rain we had was very heavy and very long, i might be concerned of it seeping thru and or puddling up if not properly staked down and tightened.There are 2 doors on this tent. It comes with a wall divider and a sort of canopy that hooks up with the rain fly. I haven't put this on yet, but it might have helped with some of the water coming in the zipper area on the door.But like i said earlier... I got this for the Room space. And its huge. sooo im kinda 50/50 with it right now. Should my opinion of this tent change, i will come back and update my review at that time."
501396,1,"This shrink worked great. I wasn't able to determine the percentage of shrink as I used it on something not much smaller in diameter than the shrink I bought, but did appear to be atleast 2X.

No special washing/drying needed, which as horse women we don't have time to mess with. The fabric does not attract dirt and hay as some other fabrics do. I especially like the zipper pocket - perfect size for horse treats or my cell phone."

454297,0,"I've had the watch for 5 months now. I am pretty hard on watches and was looking for a good quality watch that would last a few years.Cons: On the bezel at 12 o'clock the raised piece fell out after 2 weeks. The bezel is also difficult to turn when my hands are sweaty. The watch was advertised as being water resistant to 200m and the watch face says ""200m"" but the back of the casing is engraved with ""water resistant 100m"". Once while painting the crown somehow loosened and fell out of the watch, so now I make sure I periodically test it for tightness. After re-inserting the crown the watch had a hard time keeping proper time for a week, but has since kept time properly.Pros: I am very impressed with the glow-in-the-dark parts. They stay illuminated through to the wee hours of the morning. The face is scratch resistant. I dented and scratched the bezel quickly (which could be why it doesn't spin easily) but the face has sustained no scratches."

In order to get it fixed, I have to pay the return shipping for their original non-working product, then possibly a fee on top of that. Absolutely horrible business practice to make the customer pay return shipping for a product that fails within the warranty period. Seeing if I can get an exchange through Sams Club so I don't have to send it to the company.3 bad reviews, to 8 good ones should tell you not to buy this product. For DMI Sports, Inc. it is inexcusable to make a customer pay return shipping and a possible fee for THEIR non-working product. DO NOT BUY!!!"
499624,2,"Recommended use: I bought this to use as a paperweight on my office desk, but it sort of looks cheap, so I gave up on that use and instead gifted it to an old girlfriend from Clemson U. The novelty of gifting a big diamond with the Clemson logo is probably this item's highest and best use.Cons: The gift box was extremely cheap (was falling apart). Looking at the picture online, I thought the paw was embedded in or behind the glass, but no: The and the tiger paw on paperweight itself is basically just a sticker, and on my item the paw had a visible scratch through it. It's really too big to have laying around on one's desk."
484917,0,"A great price from Amazon and good enough for an inexpensive air rifle scope, but don't expect too much. GAMO is a respected name in air rifles, but this scope is nothing spectacular. I didn't use the rings that came with it as I already had better one's on the rifle. I normally have to spend a few minutes re-zeroing the scope almost every time I shoot. I've been using it about a year and so far it's held up to the recoil of my air rifle (RWS Model 34, 1100 fps). Otherwise, the scope has good clarity, but I've not checked for weatherproofness as I only use it indoors. If I had the money I'd buy a Leupold VXII, but at $400 it's out of my price range for a plinker.Bottom line: if you want a decent, inexpensive scope and don't mind having to regularly re-zero, this scope is a good way to go. If you want to spend more, you can probably find something better."
210623,0,"This is what I was saying after giving this a blast to test its limits. Extremely loud, with not much variable for control of volume.

Not unhappy with it, just limited its uses."
49057,0,This is a beautiful watch with a great feel. I have the white faced version. I love the style and get many compliments. But about a month after I got it I noticed the the split timer hand (black hand) was no longer resetting to zero. I have done several manual adjustment to realign the hands but every time I use the stop watch feature it no longer resets to zero. Very frustrating. I expected more from Accutron and from a watch in this price range.
200678,0,"The problem with these is that the liner inside fits in a way that the crotch of the exterior of the shorts rides really low, and creates an unattractive pouch in the front, like you are hiding some kind of accident in your pants. I don't know about you, but when I spend money on workout clothes, I expect them to be functional, but I don't think it's too much to expect them not to look weird. Other than this, the quality of the materials is great, so if you by chance have a body type that can wear these a bit better, I would recommend trying them on in the store first to make sure, which unfortunately kind of defeats the convenience of online shopping."

371149,2,"I'm completely surprised to report that this paddle is totally unusable by a proficient right handed person. The paddle is drilled for 3 twist angles between the paddles.-60 degrees (which is what left handed paddlers use0 degrees which is for novices and children+120 degrees which is not usable by any humanWhat is missing is +60 which is what proficient right handed paddlers would use.I'm wondering if this is defective or if they just don't know what they are doing. Novices or children will be satisfied with a 0 degree twist angle (the blades are in the same plane). Howver given the foam wrappers on the handle the diameter might be large for a child's grip.the blades are symmetric (not assymetrically curved) and heavily constructured, but for the price this is fine. It's an excellent value if you are left handed. the construction appears to be durable.UPDATE 1:The company checked their inventory and discovered that all of their paddles were defective. apologized and pulled this off amazon.com for a while.UPDATE 2:A year went by and I ordered another one. Amazingly this one is also drilled wrong. It's not quite as bad as the first one but the holes for the left and right sides are asymmetric about the neutral position. the Right handed one is now too far >90 degrees, again making this unusable by a right hander.close inspection shows the right hand hole was drilled after the paddle was anodized since unlike the other two holes the cut hole is sloppy and edged with shiny metal.Bottom line: you could make this work but it would probably injure your wrists if you are a serious paddler. Apparently this company has a huge quality control problems."

490180,0,These gloves do a great job of keeping your hands warm on those 40-50 degree days. I wouldn't give them a shot in freezing temps. But in the late winter in central Japan they held up fine. Their main feature is that they block the wind and keep some of your body heat in your hands. After a few miles of running my hands got warm enough that I had to take them off. They're also handy as an inner liner for any other gloves you have.Buy them for running and use them as a glove liner as well.
232722,0,"Buying racquetballs is confusing, even for someone like me who plays regularly and has used all of the different colors at one point or another. Someone should create an in-depth, brand-by-brand guide, but for now I offer you a brief tutorial on the different colors and their standard uses.BLUE - For amateur or recreational players - These are the cheapest and most commonly used ball and can be found in Wal-Mart or any sporting goods store. They work fine but tend to break more easily than others and tend lose their bounce faster than others.RED - The fastest option - A lot of people who I play with prefer the red ball, the fastest ball on the market, and I didn't realize until doing a little research that the red ball is actually intended as an outdoor ball since that extra liveliness is needed on an outdoor court. With a fresh red ball, it can feel like you are playing with a rubber bouncy ball, which can be both fun and frustrating. The nice thing is that even after many plays the ball still has decent bounce, so it may be the longest-lasting option. This ball favors those with a power game. This ball is not available at all sporting goods stores so you may want to buy it online.PINK - Basically the same as red, but probably easier to see - Of the serious racquetball players I know, the pink ball is probably their favorite, and not just because it appeals to their feminine side. I think the primary reason is that it is as lively as the red balls but probably a little easier to see (red can be hard to see because red, white, and brown all blur together at high speeds). I may be misjudging since I've only used it a couple of times, but the pink ball also seems slightly thicker and sturdier than the red ball.PURPLE - Another fast option; most common ball on pro tours - This is the fastest ball that is expressly designed for indoor play (unlike the red or pink balls). It's probably the most commonly used ball on pro tours as it is the official ball of the IRT. However, with this ball you should be careful that it says ""HD"" in the name because I'm pretty sure there are some balls that should be in the blue category but just happen to be colored purple.GREEN - A fast-ish, sturdy option - This might be the second-most commonly used ball behind blues and can be found at many sporting goods stores (but not at Wal-Mart, most likely). It's not as fast as the purple or red but faster than the blue, so is a nice in-between ball. I've also found that it tends to be a fairly sturdy ball, resistant to breaks. On the downside, some people seem to have trouble seeing the green ball (especially if they are colorblind).BLACK - Slowest ball, for ralliers - Technically, the black ball is designed to be the slowest to allow for the longest rallies, so it may be the ball preferred by people who can't move as swiftly or who have more of a finesse game. But it gets confusing, because I've played with two different brands of black balls, one that was the worst I have ever played with (called Slazenger Black) because it felt like I was playing squash -- the ball wasn't just slow, it didn't bounce! -- and the other brand I played with (don't know what it was; maybe Ektelon) felt near-perfect because it was slightly heavier than the typical ball but still had good bounce, so it was easy to anticipate while also bouncing at reasonable height. If I can figure out what that brand was, I will update this post.---Bottom line: I suggest the pink ball if you are looking for a lively ball and short rallies, the black ball (but not the Slazenger!) if you are looking for a slow ball and long rallies, or the green ball if you are looking for something in between. The blue ball is also fine if you're just looking for something basic and cheap.Prices will typically be cheaper (probably 15-35% cheaper) if you buy them in-store, but a lot of stores don't have a great selection or don't allow you to buy in bulk, so there are benefits to buying online, too. I'd suggest checking out a price search engine like Google Shopping before buying online."
21427,0,"Holds a 1911 very tightly. Will NOT let it go at all unless the release catch is pressed. Take a leather holster, ala my Yaqui slide, and hold the gun upside down in it and it will let go of the gun after extended use. These will not. However, that being said, these holsters only fit the FULL SIZE 1911s. My Commander model does not fit the holster completely. The holster is made for a full length slide and there is a full inch of space between the end of the barrel and the bottom of the holster that is just empty. Returned it to the store where I got it. It is made very well and does exactly what the manufacturer claims it will do. Just be aware that it will not perfectly fit all sub-models of a particular gun or gun family."

178690,1,I love the Zippo I received it was not the same one I ordered but I still love it !!! It has a diffrent Print on the front but in the end it is still the same concept Thank you and it had great fast Shipping...
299958,1,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I found the instructions to be acceptably clear, though they could have been formatted better. They were certainly clearer than the instructions for the kid's swingset I put together last summer for example. I am a mechanical engineer though so my experience may not be representative.The resulting machine was very sturdy and I am pleased with what I received for my money.Like everyone else, I found the angle indicator to be about 20 degrees off and there was no way to adjust it.More guidance on how best to use the machine to increase flexibility would be good.I use the machine on carpet and that prevents the 'sudden release' problem that others have described.I am only 5'7"" and even my legs hang off the ends a little. A really tall person might have a problem.All in all, I'm quite pleased with it."
462897,0,This product is great. The only down side is the mat that it comes with. Very small!
63580,0,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It does go fast right after being charged but it doesn't hold a charge for longer then 10-15 minutes at a time. It does recharge again quickly but it only goes fast for about 5 minutes as the charge weakens the scooter slows down. My daughter still loves it and does not mind waiting for it to charge again.
431764,2,"I bought one of these things. It does put out a very strong spark, but it's not very durable. Mine literally fell apart after about a year of carrying in my pack, with very light usage. I'm VERY unimpressed."
380036,0,"First thing I noticed was how heavy it was which seems to be a good thing.Second thing I noticed was how the aluminum case feels like plastic with aluminum accents. The case is extremely disappointing. Slightly concerned about the durability considering the weigh it's containing.The chips have a few flaws, but seem fine for home use. Some other reviews mention problems with the colors on the sides of the chips. I either don't see the same issue or I received a different set."
433287,0,The bag got here faster than something else I ordered before the item. It's a nice sling backpack don't get me wrong but it's just too small to be effective for school.
294244,2,"Does not Fit the Vista HCx. Garmin said it would, Amazon said it would, but it doesn't. Might be nice if it fit."
71806,1,"I was cursed with weak ankles... I tried everything, high-tops, low-tops, wraps, braces, and the only item that has fully protected my ankles is this brace. It's a bit bulky but after playing in it for a few weeks, you forget it is there. I have rolled my ankle once while wearing this, but I was able to walk it off no problem, whereas if I didn't have the brace on, I surely would have been on the shelf for a couple weeks. 5 stars from me"
7249,1,These leggings are nice and pretty good quality. They are not see-through unless you buy them too small. Mine fit perfectly. The legs are a little long (and I'm 5'8) but I like them that way. Good quality. Really like them.

266666,0,"It will probably take me 2 hrs to figure out the terrible instructions and put this thing together. It might even take longer. couldnt even find an instructional video online to show how to assemble. i am dreading completing this assembly. Ok, it took me 1 hr 15 mins. The way to assemble it unfortunately is to look at other photos on the internet in color so you can figure out where parts go. The instructions will help you about 10% and the photos online are about 90%. Tried the thing out and here is the only bad thing. When you undo the safety catch and the arm is supposed to rest ready to be sprung, the arm starts to slowly swing or move by itself. Not happy at all so I think what I need to do after I call the company tomorrow is to drill a hole in the foot plate where you step on and attach a nylon cord. So when you are about to launch a clay you have to pull on the cord to keep the footplate up and step on the plate. Its like the weight of the foot plate is too heavy and again starts to move the arm launcher by itself. My friend had a basic one with a spring and attached it to a flat board and just reset it and pulled the spring loaded lever. It looked cheap but if I had to do this again I may have bought one like his."
218223,2,"I purchased two pair of these breeches. Upon wearing the first pair, the waist was baggy, which caused the crotch to sag a lot. I return the other pair."
187366,1,"it fits great, looks great and best of all, its comfortable, and you can look good dressed like a bum"
176788,0,"These fenders look to be bulletproof and very well constructed, but... the description states ""Includes all the necessary hardware for mounting to virtually any bike"". This is far from accurate, your bike must have fender eyelets in order to get them mounted. Without the fender eyelets these are impossible to install. I was also disappointed to see that the universal installation also assumed your bike had a cross brace at the brake bridge and the chainstay. If you don't have these braces you can still install, but the recommendation is to just use the included zip ties to mount the fender, not exactly a clean install IMO.I contacted the vendor and they told me i needed to get the Planet Bike ""SpeedEZ"" fender set for my bike (Specialized Rockhopper).On a positive note Amazon made the return a breeze and paid for the return shipping and everything."
344837,2,"I know it's cliche but you get what you pay for. The name lifetime only stands as a brand name as this product didn't last but a few minutes. After assembly which was relatively easy excluding the backboard connectors which don't stretch out the way they should, as I went to get the water hose to fill it up it for no reason at the backboard ripped away for the connectors bring the whole court done and forever ending it's lifetime. If you want a decent backboard system, $100 is obviously not going to get you any quality. I'm going back to my spalding that took a tornado to tear it down."
308191,0,"The sled is good, fast, and easy to use. By only complaint is that the first time I rode it I created dents in the bottom of the metal sled. They were easy enough to pop out but the metal was weakened and they kept coming back, even with my 40 pound son riding it. Perhaps I was just too big for the sled. So now I wonder just how much damage this thing will take before I declare it dead."
365839,0,"I bought this shirt for my very thin, 12 yr. old son - it's much too small on him and I even purchased a large to give him an extra year to grow into it! I understand it's supposed to be a tight-fitting ""under"" garment, but the sleeves are too short and it's not nearly long enough at the waist. Very disappointed for such a high-dollar brand name. If you order 1 or 2 sizes larger than needed, it should be fine."
115028,0,"I purchased this clothing tree without reading that it is youth. Despite this, I am pleased with the product I received. The paint detail was nicely done. Assembly was a breeze.This was a gift for a Mets fan. Even though it is a youth product, we hang out clothes on it. It works fine. It's sturdy and has not tipped over even under the weight of several layers of adult clothing.The only complaint I have for the manufacturer is that the package arrived with 3 stickers on 3 different sides of the box that showed the product. This was ordered as a gift, so when it arrived, the recipient knew what was in the box immediately."
297046,2,"Received this out of the box today, and it's going right back. It's tiny - not for an adult head. On top of that, the field of view is small also, like wearing blinders, you see nothing to the left or right, no peripheral vision on this mask, which is important in paintball. It looks like it could probably handle fog well, the lens was dual paned and thermal, but I'll never know, it's going back because of the overall small size and small field of view."
204887,1,"Works great at 30x ,good at 45x ,not good at 60x. but at 1/3 the price of the high end scope it is a good buy."
350952,1,Great product at a great price. I am a very satisfied customer and the person whom received the gift absolutely loved it.
311167,2,I was very excited to order this to bring lunch every day and liked the fact it is so durably made but the issue is that the top of the bag is so tight that opening it and putting in some lunch items is a struggle. I wish this case had a top that could just be opened and left open. This bag reminds me of those little coin purses that needs to be flexed to be opened. I am sorry but this case feels bullet proof but it seems very small for a 12 pack to me and just a major dissapointment. I feel like it would be useful for bringing 1 sandwich and soda. Trying to stack up containers was not easy at all and the bag filled too fast. I bought another popular bag that is smaller on the outside but much roomier and more convenient on the inside. Really wish I had not made this purchase but don't want to deal with shipping it back.

231685,1,I was having a problem with the nails on my big toes splitting from playing tennis. I started using the toe caps each time I play and my nails have not split since. They are very comfortable and I forget I am wearing them. One tip: don't pull them on too far or your nail will eventually cut through the rubber.
44863,1,This is the frist swiss army knife I enjoy having on me all the time. I hunt 4 months out of the year and there is always a need to have a knife on you. The lock blade is fantastic and has the perfect number of tools. I would like to have another smaller blade with the knife but I cant complain. The black outer finish is very durrable and will hold up over time.
269295,0,"They really need to put the measurements on the ad for these types of things (maybe they do by now). This helmet was too small for any of the grandkids, maybe would fit a 1 year old. We gave it to someone outside the family."
310438,0,"Coleman's folding shovel is a sturdy, but TINY tool. The product description describes it as being 23"" long when unfolded. I measured it at 16"". The shovel head measures just3 5/8"" x 5"". It would be good for hiking or backpacking and the carrying pouch could be attached to a belt, but it is not the size I was expecting to ""out"" a campfire. I gave it 3 stars for it's sturdy construction."
44844,0,"When considering buying this knife, I thought that the lockback feature and one hand opening would be selling points. However, this is not a one handed opener or closer. That kind of negates the point over a regular swiss army knife. I don't think this is more useful than my swiss army camper. The saw also catches fairly easily and doesn't cut with a forward motion. On the plus side it looks unique for a swiss army knife and it has gotten a lot of positive reviews and is standard issue for the Swiss Army so something must be good about it. In comparison, I would go with the camper, which also has the useful wine cork."
235565,2,"Horrible service, didn't get what i ordered, the order said I would receive a mouth guard case and the picture clarified that. Instead, I got a mouth guard in the mail and I told the company I wanted the mouth guard case. So naturally they send me ANOTHER MOUTH GUARD."
290286,0,The Hogue 1911 grips are well made and exactly as defined. I bought the grips for my Chiappa 1911 replica which did not fit my gun and had to be altered. This was my mistake and the description of the item was correct but I purchased them anyway. My three star rating was due to the fact that I couldn't know for sure if the grips would fit my gun until after I purchased them. As for the grips themselves they are very well made and flexible rubber. The only bad thing I could find with these grips was that they are too flexible and did not hold the safety mechanism on my pistol correctly. I hope this is informative.
191599,1,"I recommend this backpack to anybody wanting to travel. I probably packed 35 lbs into it and carried it around my back as I traveled and I really didn't feel it to be too heavy. Great quality, great features, overall a great backpack. Only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because the straps, which are crucial to making the bag feel comfortable, loosen somewhat easily, so I had to adjust every half an hour or so, but that's not too bad."

271517,1,I bought these after trying to decide if u really need snap caps to dry fire. I decided to play it safe and buy some. They fit perfect in my G 26 and work as advertised.
423452,1,We had these when we were kids although the foot design is different. This one should last longer than those of 55 years ago and might be safer to boot.

They work the muscles from head to toe and sculpt and firm the body. Not being bound by gravity the strength bands offer an endless array of exercises. The best $50 I spent on equipment ever!"
89143,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."

40020,1,"If you want a double bag for cold weather camping this is it. It really is a double bag, not two singles zipped together like some others. The canvas cover is tough enough for any camping style. The only minor drawback is the carrying sack. It is made of the same tough canvas but it is just a little small for this heavy insulated bag, you can plan on quite a tussle to get the bag stuffed back into the carry sack. If the sack was just a little bigger it would be perfect."
482363,0,"I received this knife as a present. I would not have bought it for myself had I been able to handle it in person. Not that it's a bad knife, it's just that I don't feel some of the features are appropriate for me.The first thing I didn't like was the shape of the blade. There's very little belly, so it's not as good a slicer as it could be. The second aspect of the blade that I'm not fond of is the pointy tip. It's weak. It's a good tip for delicate operations as in removing splinter but any force on the tip and I'm certain it will bend and/or break.So the tip makes it a delicate knife, but how to square that with the heavy (at 3oz) steel liner? A heavy knife like this you would expect to be heavy duty. The heavy steel frame is also odd as it has been thinned out considerably so that it can function as a frame lock knife. Well, what's the point of heavy steel liners that are thinned out in a critical area? Contrast that to my favorite pocket knife, a CRKT chill, which weights 2.0, and has the same blade length and a thicker blade. Just around 2.4oz is where, in my opinion, a knife goes from lightweight, or not noticeable in pocket, to heavy.The scales are metal and smooth. This is a slick knife handle. While easy on the hands, a knife handle surface like this can easily slip, with adverse results naturally.Well, the points I mentioned make this a 'gentleman's folder' in my opinion, rather than an everyday working knife for an everyday kind of guy, like myself. If you're a city slicker, or a suburbanite, then I suspect this is will be a dandy knife for you. For the rest of us, well, something a little more practical might be called for.Mmh, almost forgot to mention the safety lock. The particular issue I want to point out in regard to this, is that it's entirely possible to have the lock in the closed position and then close the blade on top of the lock. Not only wouldn't one have the blade locked, but now it's also a tad further toward the open position.Well, it may seem like I'm entirely negative toward the knife. I'm not. It has some fine features, but those aren't the ones that concerned me."

55380,0,We purchased this bike for our 2 year old. It was only until his 3rd birthday that he was able to touch his feet to the ground. Great indoor bike. Only sad thing was that the wood cracked on the tire area days after receiving it. Not sure why.
454904,0,"It was cheap, $30.10 including shipping, but it may not be as accurate as the more expensive ones. My heartrate will jump 10 bpm either way while doing nothing differently on my treadmill. This occurs every few minutes or so. I've learned to just take an average."
63156,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed. Thank you ladies, for your review comments, as I rely on these to make my purchases."

I tried washing them in the laundry and hand-washing, I even tried foot powder but they were just getting dirtier.

I wear the largest size Vibram Bikilas carried for women, and these still fit comfortably with the socks."
477558,1,"1. Eagle only sent one guy for the delivery. He couldn't move the huge box inside the house by himself. I had to help him a bit. (I'm 30 yr female).2. The assembling instruction is not hard to follow. But I would suggest 2 people do this. It took me a little bit over 1 hour to install.3. It looks very sturdy and heavy. The folding mechanism is easy, but I've yet to figure out how to move it by myself: it's just too heavy for me to tilt.4. I ran on it for 15 minutes as a test. A good buy with less than 1K price."
383859,0,"Overall, this is a fine bike for my nearly-4 year old. The only problem he has is the left pedal keeps unscrewing and will fall off if I don't tighten it after about 10-15 minutes of riding. I have tightened it with a wrench, but it doesn't help. If not for the pedal problem, I would rate this bike 5 stars."
342404,0,"Sliders are excellent for developing both cardio and your quads. But like anything, you must be vigilant and maintain proper form.I have been experimenting and so far have settled on alternating aerobic workouts (set the ends of the Power Slide wider) and HIIT workouts (set them narrower). This is a lot of fun and you can find some nice HIIT timer apps for your iPod or whatever, and they add playlists. Just hook it up to some speakers. The HIIT workouts are a kill and also easy to fit into my schedule: 15 minutes is plenty.Another HIIT benefit is if you play hockey: this imitates the short bursts of speed required throughout a shift.I'm 6'4"" and about 225 and I use it on a low-nap carpet. When I do even the slower style skating the slide starts to pivot slowly across the floor. I partly corrected this by laying a bunch of weights on the unused portion of the slide (I bought the 8 ft model). So if you are big and like to do a robust workout, you might consider the 10 footer, just to have the extra material to ""pin down"".The quality seems good. It is well made and the ends are fairly hefty.Once waxed it is incredibly slippery, as other reviewers have stated.I wish they would place markings down the edge, every 6 or 12 inches, say. That would help me align the moving blocker accurately for each type of workout. I added my own marks with a silver Sharpie.Oh, and the booty sizings are completely off. I ordered an extra XL pair because they tell you that the standard pair only fits up to size 11. I'm a size 12-13 and the standard booties fit my shoes fine.UPDATE ****************Original review: 2012.02.05Update: 2012.08.06OK it is six months later. My quads have grown/strengthened tremendously, and I attribute that more to HIIT on the slide board than to all the hockey I have been playing. HIIT may be a fad, but really it has been around forever and that's becuase it delivers results. I am totally convinced.I am reducing the product rating from 5 stars to 3.The problem is that the inner side of the stops, at the place where your foot lands and pushes off, has broken. This happened on both stops. It turns out they are HOLLOW and UNSUPPORTED right there in the bottom-middle of the stop, the highest-use part of the thing(!!). The plastic is not up to the stress. It appears the designers shortened the supports in that area so that the carry strap could loop through. Brilliant.I now plan to make my own replacements with some 2x4s and foam. Either re-using the original hardware or going with some coach bolts or something similar. If this doesn't work well I may have to go with a higher-end slide board, the type they sell to gyms. Presumably would be much stronger product.Whatever happens, must keep on slidin'....."
139206,0,"This set is okay if space and weight are not a concern. You can also buy these pieces separately at a camping store and some sporting goods stores. I recommend this because then you can select the pieces yourselves, and the quality is better this way. I find that these sets have lower quality. There are also better camp percolators that pack better (e.g., Olicamp). These cups are good if you want a basic camp cup. They are wide and good for small kids, but I recommend buying them separately."
413924,0,"I was very excited to received this product, but its not easy to put together. And when I finally did get together it squeaks, and the handle bar, although its secure is wobbly. I haven't use it as much as I should but I will."

456196,0,"First, the ad states ""an overmolded handle""...mine does NOT have that feature!The plastic was not blended well and has streaks of muliple colors over the whole box. This is definately not a good box for ammo storage! Not strong enough and if you did fill it, you wouldn't be able to lift it, nor would the handle be strong enough.I'll stick with the military surplus ammo cans!It was my mistake to buy it... will give it to my neighbor for a sewing kit.Great delivery from Amazon but, the ad should be cleaned up!"
101318,1,"I bought this tarp from Amazon to cover my 15 foot boat. It seems to be perfect for this purpose and I am confident it will hold up over the winter.I would prefer just a few more gromets but, even so, it will work well."
421406,0,"This gun is beautifully built and constructed. It is accurate and the recoil free feature makes it a dream to shoot. It looks like a high powered rifle (scared the trousers off my neighbour!). Sight adjustment is easy and provided you give it about 250 pellets to wear in, you may be soon shooting tight groups at 25 metre range. So why only 3 stars? This baby is too heavy. I am 5'11 and can hit my driver 280 yards on the golf course but I struggle to carry this gun around in the field. It is also difficult to cock as the spring pressure is high in order to deliver its .22 pellet at 950 fps. What makes cocking difficult is that it has a side lever which makes it cumbersome and, IMHO detracts from its stylish looks.I will be selling my gun soon, and because I am so very impressed with Diana/RWS guns will be replacing it with the 460 Magnum which is almost 20% lighter delivers the same 950 fps for .22 slugs, and and though it does not have the recoil free mechanism is easier to cock with an underlever system. I like a little recoil anyway : )Chris"
37396,0,I liked this item. It was a little larger than I expected but it has so many features it's worth it. The reason I rated it 3 stars is that the pen does not work on mine and I was unable to find a replacement for it anywhere without sending the knife back.
357193,0,This coffee pot works o.k. but it is VERY poorly constucted. Be prepared to make some modifications to make it last.
175710,1,"This crankset is heavy, but it is the cheapest available. The chainguard was somewhat bent, but it bent into position with no effort at all. If you're wanting to restore an old bike or you don't care about the weight, this is the crankset for you. If you are planning to fix your road bike, however, this may be too heavy for that."
322353,0,"The product is Ok, good for practice. The only thing was that it was not clear they was going to send JUST ONE star... I though I was going to receive 3 just like the advertised picture."
332347,0,"There are a great many P-51 kits on the market, most are more then likely of higher quality than this one. I bought this particular one because of the nose art ""Big Beautiful Doll"". It's a somewhat flimsy kit, I've had worse but that's not saying much. For a few extra dollars you can get a nicer Tamiya kit. I believe they have a ""Old Crow"" model (one of the more popular nose art reproductions). There aren't many features in this kit, and maybe only fifty or sixty parts.If you want a notable American WWII fighter-bomber, and don't care about quality or are looking for a cheaper kit, go for the Revell/Monogram P-47D Thunderbolt Razorback. It's a kit from the sixties like this P-51 is, but it is of a far higher quality."
12310,1,"I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas. It was perfect. He's 6'2"" and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly. He loves wearing it. It's great for Southern winters were it doesn't get too cold."
278282,0,"I bought a similar item for my friend. He liked it a lot. the only problem was that it a shade too small for him. but he is still using it al the same. For the price I got it for, I expected a good size but I cant complain. it is fair to buy."
253411,0,"Shinai lasted a little while, which was a big improvement from ""full force bokken"" purchased earlier (other review for them.) Still have one that's holding together well, the other broke in two. Would look at something more durable if I was more serious about sparring scenario."
455252,0,"It is a decent product, however most difficult to follow written instructions. I had to finally call the company to get a walk-through. Still,I don't use it that often. One has to strap a band around your chest, first moistening the ends, then you are ready to go. I would prefer a unit that is only on your wrist, if they make one.Many products do not give enough detailed info to a shopper so they can make an informed decision."
392965,0,"Item was adequate, but had some design features that I think I will change."
418914,1,"I love these shirts. I have several, split between three x and four x large. The three x fits me in the chest and arms perfectly, but the four has just the right length. I would say the sizing's off, but I suspect that is more about my body shape than the shirts themselves. The fabric is very comfortable for a synthetic, it is not too heavy nor too light, and it keeps you cool -- a must in summer weather. The colors are bright and bold and don't fade through the washes. I have other moisture-wicking shirts, but these are my favorites.The unfortunate thing is that it appears that Under Armour is dropping these, and not carrying the four x at all in any size polo. I don't know if that is a new company policy, they seem to pushing this new fabric instead of the HeatGear. I hope that there is a market large enough for them to keep producing these shirts. Word of mouth works; my coworker wore his new UA Performance polo to work today from my recommendation. If they are dropping this as a product, I will offer to take any remain stock off their hands."
439434,1,Sharp as a razor blade right out of the package. Sturdier than expected and great for such a low price. Easy to carry around on the belt and easy to release from the sheath. I was told by friends that the knife looked like it came out of Aladin and all I needed was a vest.
448902,1,"Wheels come with everything you need. Cog is 18 tooth with snap ring, all the hardware to clamp rear brake to frame included. Wheels are sturdy and strong. 36 spokes, didn't need to be trued, wheels are direct bolt on to any generic bicycle. I changed my 26"" wheels to 24"" wheels in a matter of minutes, take off the old, assemble the new, buy rim tape, not included from wheel master, Niagara Cycle Works has this item, bolt on. Simple and easy period."
313314,1,A regular air pump with or without a needle does not appear to work to inflate this product well. It is very rugged and durable feeling though.
129504,0,"I tried to replace my official jet basketball with this item, and it lacks certain elements I enjoyed with my previous ball. Those elements include grip, microfiber cushion, and overall bounce mechanics. When purchasing this ball, keep in mind that its longevity may be limited, and the Wilson Official Jet Basketball is a better purchase."
283401,2,"This belt plaque looked great in the picture and held as many belts as I needed to display. Now that it's here, I can't figure out how to put it together and it looks so flimsy that I 'm not sure it's worth the effort of trying to figure it out;"

98650,1,I just got these lizards yesterday. They shipped in great time! I love the action i haven't caught anything on them yet as I only had about an hour to fish them but they have great action i rigged the up with a pegged bullet weight texas rigged on a Gamakatsu 3/0 EWG offset worm hook. Again great action.
506993,2,"Nascar Thunder 2003. I bought this game thinking I will have fun,but this game is awful in the ways the cars turn. I don't know if the PS2 version is like this or what. But I do know that the Gamecube version make the cars MAD LOOSE TURNING WITH DEFAULT SETUP. How loose you say WELL STUPID LOOSE!!!!! IT'S LIKE IF YOU DRIVE INTO A CORNER WITHOUT STABLITY CONTROL YOU WILL RAM INTO OTHER CARS OR SPINOUT UNLESS YOU ARE USING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BRAKE EVERY TIME,OR ARE A PRO AT THIS GAME. LIKELY I CAN MY RETURN GAME TO GAMESTOP BY THEIR USED RETURN POLICY. I DO NOT KNOW SHOULD I RETURN IT OR NOT YET. Also Daytona and Talladega races are very unrealistic. Watch a Daytona and Talladega on YouTube the cars are always very close to each other during the whole race not all spread out across the track like the days before plate racing."
467962,0,these are a verry well made pantie but a littel to much spandex and it not meant for every day use ore all day but it can be woren by ether a man or a woman

296268,0,"This gun bag is alright, but i wouldnt recommend this if u have a big gun like a m4 or ak unless u plan to take it apart and then put it together again . This bag barely fits my p90 so overall unless u got a pretty small AEG or just want to use it to store pistols then this is the right product for u."
21301,0,"I've been looking for a holster for my Beretta 96A1 for a month now and blackhawk is certainly the way to go. But this holster doesn't accomodate the accessory rail. The gun just dones't fit at all. I sent it back for a quick refund. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be many options for this firearm. Some people are suggesting get the glock 21 holster and file it a bit. I ordered a fobus holster... its okay, its passive retention but hard as heck to draw from. It doesn't seem practical."
23891,0,"So these are lightweight which is nice, but the knife is just stupid. It should be obvious; if it was a good knife you wouldn't be putting it on the side of the fork which is put in your mouth. Still, they are lightweight and handy. The multi-colored variety pack is nice because you can keep track of YOUR spork when camping with a group."
405127,0,"Very large bag, big open pockets on the sides. Very open. No special pockets for protection of guns, ammo, or magazines. This bag would be a better 'Go-Bag' than a range bag. Blackhawk makes a good product, every time. I have never been disappointed with them. Just have to buy another bag for the firearm range. Will definitely put this bag into use though."
504575,2,I've had this tea kettle 2 weeks and it has started to leak at the lowest seam. It can't be used and Amazon won't take it back. What a bad purchase.
350090,0,I purchased this as an oversweater for cold weather golfing. For this purpose it is perfect for me. The sweatshirt was sized correctly and of very good quality and had worn very comfortably.
479023,2,The most important thing about a cotton tee is that it NOT shrink in the vertical.Russel tee's didn't used to and that's why I buy them.This latest batch pretty much joins the pantheon of cheap crappy tee shirts that after the first wash are unwearable because they shrink until they don't tuck into my pants and get so wide in the body they feel like wearing very short tent.Guess I'm looking for a new brand.
146218,2,"The shorts were top-notch quality, but they weren't what I wanted. The product's description did not adequately tell me what I was purchasing, so I had to send them back."
44544,0,"It does what it says it does, but you cannot make a mistake there is no way to correct it by going back and changing a stroke if you accidently put one more or one less on the score keeper. Like I said it does what it says, it keeps scores for up to four players named players 1-4 ( no names input) and keeps score up to 18 holes; that's it. You're better off purchasing one of the $40.00 or up ones, thy are more forgiving (can correct mistakes) you can also save games, save courses, and save player names, add yardage and so forth, this one you can only keep score, but you get what you pay for."
352918,1,"U don't even feel bothered by them, helps you work out without worrying about how lose ur shirts are or if u r sweating too much, u won't even notice u wearing them.."
177280,0,The color is a muted blue. I wanted navy blue. They were way to thick for my purpose. Will be good in my snow boots.

441840,0,The product is awesome! I just ordered the wrong size and now have to re-order and then I will be extremely pleased so check with me again!!
368102,0,"UPDATE- apparently there's no way to differentiate (or link) product reviews on Amazon to a particular seller (or a particular batch of product). So as I stated in my original review, these goggles are great (or I wouldn't be buying them again and again !). However, the pair I bought recently from a particular seller/batch on Amazon has a bad case of fogging- clearly a lemon. I'm revising my rating to 3 stars, as these goggles are otherwise great (deserve 5 stars actually, if not for manufacturing quality control issues).It also appears that Aquasphere doesn't make this model in mirrored version any longer, as they're rather difficult to find online. The new model- Kayenne doesn't come in a mirrored version either. But I did find non-mirrored Kaiman at a local Walmart selling for just $15. They are made in Italy too which is a huge plus in my book, but cost less than Speedo and other brands which are made in China.ORIGINAL REVIEW-I've owned at least half a dozen of Aqua Sphere Kaiman goggles over the years and they always worked great. However, the goggles I ordered recently, fog up within minutes of use. Even the defogging solution doesn't help. It must be defective stock or something from this seller- DO NOT BUY.It seems I'm not the only one experiencing it- there're other reviewers reporting the fogging issue."
321103,1,no problem with the watch. the directions are easy to follow on the manual/instructional CD. the C6 is the only version of the Triax which counts calories- a great plusthe only complaint i have is that i couldn't get a heart rate reading when i wore the band over my under armour shirtother then that- i'm very satisfied with the watch & price
6931,1,"Both of my boys (8 yo and 10 yo)got one of these for Christmas. Even on Christmas day, when it was very cold out, they got out and tried them. The older one picked it up very quick and is now really good on it. The younger one took a little longer to master it, but he's got it now. They seem to be really well made, no complaints."
450870,1,"I am a huge fan of Under Armour's workout apparel, and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts, also own several each of Under Armour's Tech T-shirts (0382) and the Loose Gear shirts (0084) - I've written reviews on those as well.Ok, let's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt. It isn't for everybody. It's tight - a compression fit, the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights, but on your upper body. Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit, and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that, it's a high-quality, great-performing shirt. It provides a lot of muscle support, and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry. As I said, not everyone will like the fit, especially at first, but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings. Athletes in competitive team sports - football, hockey, etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you don't have a perfect body needn't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support, regardless of what sport or workout you are into. In fact, if you're just a little bit soft, it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks. You can always wear another shirt over it if you're self-conscious, just don't like how it looks on you, or haven't quite burned off enough fat yet. If you have a good physique, what can I say - you're going to look hot in this shirt. In fact, it's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first. I usually wear a size XL in the other, looser Under Armour shirts, but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these. They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight. I love this shirt in black, but there's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you can't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry. UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat, and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off. I've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up, even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat, but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch (a lot!). Either way, I haven't taken any chances."
233608,0,"I bought this light for camping and it worked fine as a tent light. But then I needed it about a year later when the power went out and No Light. What happened? Alkaline batteries should last forever when not loaded. I suspected the electronic switch was always drawing current at a low level. Checking it out with a meter, this light continuously draws .35 milliamps. In other words it's slowly draining the batteries even while off. A good AA is 1000 mA*Hrs so 4 of them divided by .40 ma equals 10,000 Hrs, a little over one year. So, if you are going to store this for long periods of time, remove the batteries. Fortunately the batteries can be easily removed."
312803,0,Works well for a $4 rope. I paid more for it but it's not worth more than $4 since its made with cheap material. You can find a better one for $8.
284437,1,"good lombar support, multiple laiers of letter built to last , good locking , funny thing is made in pakistan :))"
247597,0,Watch works fine - the problem was getting it delivered to me. This was just a painful experience made worse by Amazon who proved much less service minded that I had hoped - I asked for help for a refund as the goods never arrived but they didn't even bother to reply to the questions I asked them and passed me on to the supplier who also wasn't very forthcoming - you get the picture. So the Suunto watch is fine but be careful when buying from an Amazon approved supplier.
377887,1,"These warm up pants are great! I usually have a hard time finding my very thin 10 yr old son any kind of pants that fit his small waste. Bought the Medium sz 10-12 and they are perfect! There is also enough room left for him to grow into these too which is great because based on the construction, we'll have these for a while. They are a favorite! Bought them in Navy, Royal and Red."
377860,1,"A tremendous Hydration pack, been using it for about a year, very resistent, holds tons of stuff, use it for enduro motorcycle riding and have washed it about 40 times and still looks new. Excelent product and about half the price of Camelbaks similar products and twice as resistent."
145393,1,I loved my black Columbia fleece which I had for four years before loaning it to a friend and never getting it back...I've been been looking for a replacement for months...My sister-in-law was wearing this one over the holidays and I loved it...On a chance I went online to see if I could find it and WOW there it was!I read the reviews and felt comfortable buying a medium. It is perfect...I wear it everywhere..it is great for layering and it looks great all the time. I've washed it and it comes out looking great....my best clothes purchase of the year. I love just about everything Columbia makes.
56554,0,This bag is very nice and looks like the picture except that I ordered a red bag and it was shipped to me in orange.
205196,1,"As expected from Victorinox, great quality. I actually purchased the one-handed version first, and liked it a lot, but unfortunately lost it at work, so I bought this one as a replacement.\It's a great knife if you don't need all the usual tools associated with a Swiss knife. The liner lock for the main blade and bottle opener is sturdy, and is definitely easier to operate left-handed. It's not as heavy and unwieldly as larger 111mm models like the Champ or the Hercules, but has more tools than the Sentinel. If you need basic tools, this is the knife for you."
39038,2,We returned this item as the legs were so small. It was well made but the banding around the legs were to tight and small. If you order this order a size larger.
271914,1,"I am an experienced beginner, and found this racket pretty much matched my playing skill. I tried a Prince that is priced 3X this racket and could not really discern any major functional difference. The Prince delivered slightly less shock to the hand, but that might just be perception or difference in string tension.Only downside for this racket was that by the end of the season I had to add a non-slip grip because the original grip had become a little too slippery.For a beginner like me, this racket is outstanding value. I'd buy another."
409505,0,I had a vest like this one from about 5 years ago but it wore out and I wanted to get a replacement. I got it and it is as warm as the last one but the material seems a bit thin. Not sure how long it is going to last but 5 years would really surprise me.

494786,0,"I recently purchased these mats and I was dissappointed once I recieved them in the mail. They look alright, and will fill their aesthetic purpose, but as far as durability, these are not the mats you are looking for. They are quite flimsy and cheaply made. I don't see them lasting very long in my husbands truck. For the price I was definitely expecting more. My advice to you is to save your money...."
61851,0,"I purchased 3 of these bottles, one for myself, my fiance, & my father for Christmas. It is a GREAT bottle. However, it got only 3 stars because it is made of Polycarbonate (#7 on the bottom) & it has been known to cause cancer. I didn't know that until after I purchased them. My own fault. I don't know why CamelBak would use a plastic known to cause cancer. I verified this through several web sites. CamelBak makes another bottle that doesn't. I'm disappointed, and still use my bottle because it is so easy to drink out of. Oh well"
145450,0,"My husband bought me a Columbia Fleece jacket awhile back (from Bass Pro Shop) and I wanted another one to wear around the house. When I opened this one I noticed that the fleece was alot softer and thinner. I also noticed that the Columbia logo was on the left side of the jacket and the logo on my original jacket is on the right. I don't know if that is relevant to anything, but the quality of this jacket is definately less than my original. I am not going to go through the hassle of a return because it is an okay jacket to wear around the house on chilly mornings. It came with a $50 price tag attatched and I know I would definitely not spend that much for this particular jacket."
367078,0,"It's just a short. Quite mediocre in quality, hence the 3 stars. I didn't have high expectations for this short since I was trying to meet a minimum total for an offer and I would only use it to lounge in. The material is a bit more rough than expected. And the red is much brighter than in the pictures. The only major issue I may see for others is the discomfort that may be caused by chafing by the inner elastic band."
161226,0,"I'm an Invicta fan and I purchased this watch with high expectations. In the end though, I had to send it back and look for another model that was more functional. Despite what other reviewers have said, I was unable zero out the sub dials even after reading the (generic) instructions several times. If it can be done, it certainly should be easier to accomplish. Ultimately, the real deal-killer was simply my inability to read the dial. The face is very attractive but the white background and light colored hands and hour markings are a bad combination. Both are ""luminous Tritnite"" which is an off-white color in daylight. There just isn't enough contrast between the white face and the off-white hands to see what time it is at a glance. Other manufactures have pulled off that color combination much more effectively (for instance the Rolex this watch is designed to look like). If you've got eagle eyes and prefer fashion over function, this is your watch!"
111919,0,"Very nice just out of the box, but i wash it and put it on the dryer, came out with a little rip on the edge of the fabric, don't know what to think about this, maybe it was the regular cycle on the washing machine... other than that its pretty nice,it works!"
160537,2,"Upon positive reviews from other amazon reviewers and one of my friends who had ordered an Invicta in the past, I decided to purchase this watch.It arrived in the packaging, and was everything it was made out to be: excellent finish and build quality. Unfortunately it was a big too large for my wrist and had to pay to get it sized properly.Once that was done however, some of the pins began dropping out, so I had to take it back to have it looked at. At this point I'm still not sure if it was the watch sizer's fault, or a fault with the watch.However after this the seconds hand stopped turning, and would 'hit' the minute hand and not be able to move anymore, despite the watch keeping perfect time.So in the end had to return it to Amazon, which did a fantastic job of the return imo.So verdict, Invicta watches are a steal and look great, if you get the lucky one that was manufactured well!"
160225,0,"I ordered a size 9 and received a size 6. Needless to say I was disappointed but I daughter was happy as she wears a size 6 lol. I see where the error was made on the box, ordered it again and hoping for a 9."
128220,1,"My wife was having a problem with the clubs that she had been using for several years. Her complaints were on a daily basis, and I was the recipient of them; so I decided to try to get some relief. I went to Amazon.com and ordered the Ram Womens' Hybrid complete set. My wife has become a happy camper, and I along with her. She is now playing like she did with her original set of clubs in the 1980s; which, by the way, were Ram clubs."
38671,0,"This is a Great shirt, the only bad thing is the size, American sizes are way too big for Latin American people. size M feels more like a size L. When I try this shirt on size M realize that is a little big for me, but I used anyways."
90447,0,"I received the product and I'd like to think I'm going to be happy but don't know since I can not plug it in. Bought to use in my office at work, but the product advertised ""(optional AC adapter available for indoor use)"" but didn't come with one and I can't find where to buy it. VERY FRUSTRATING. Product listing doesn't offer it and I don't believe Amazon does either."
130528,0,"These lugs crimp okay but no better than others and are not 100%. I had to crimp using the proper tool several times on one of the lugs out of four in order to get it to hold sufficiently.

221083,0,"I bought this hat a while ago, but due to a season that has been drier than usual for my region, I haven't had the chance to try it until now. Did it keep me dry in the rain? Conditionally, yes.The material is great and very much waterproof and so will keep the front and back of your head dry...but even a mild breeze will push up the sides of the brim, exposing the side of your head and face. So, unless you're going out in windless rain, expect to get the side of your head soaked. Also, the space for you to put the hat on your head is surprisingly shallow, so it it will undoubtedly fall off unless you draw the string like a noose agaist your neck. This might or might not have been because I ordered a Small, but I needed that size because the circumference of my head is relatively small. No my head is not egg shaped.Considering all the wonderful reviews this hat recieved and the fact that it won the ""Backpacker Magazine's 2005 Editor's Choice Gold Award,"" I thought that this would be the best darned hat this side of the Western hemisphere... but it isn't. I'm returning this hat and trying my luck with another."
85365,1,I bought this cooler as a gift for my brother. It's a great looking cooler with lots of space. The color is very vibrant and the insignia looks good.
6724,0,"This vest is as advertised but is very small for it's rated size. I had to return the vest as it was just too small and out of stock larger. I would say it is a medium or maybe large at best, certainly not an XL by most standards. Quality seemed fine."

430117,2,"These shorts are extremely see through. Not sure how I'm supposed to wear them outside the house without ""flashing"" everyone my undies."
329069,0,Shorts were fine. I just didnt notice the lack of pockets.No real complaints. Just would have been nice to indicate whether pockets were present.
216629,0,"We bought this for our first camping trip to Sequoia.The tent was easy to setup. Took 30 mins the first time and 15 afterwards. It was cold and rainy the entire two days we were there. Two major problems. Even with the raincover on , you can still expect a lots of outside cold/hot air to get in. So good sleeping bags are a must. secondly, water seeps into the tent from the bottom. We had a tarp under, but still some water crept in.Since the tent is one of the most important thing that you can buy for a camping trip. I would suggest that you spend more and get as good a tent as you can. Also, this is supposed to be a 4 person tent, but you always wanna get bigger than you want. To sleep this is okay for maybe 3 people. Get a taller bigger tent and you wont regret it."
432200,1,Arrived in great condition. Saving for a future b'day gift in Feb. We are sure he'll love it and use it often.
126927,0,"The magnetic quality of the darts is no better or worse than other magnetic dart boards despite claims to the contrary.The body of the dart is a cheap molded trumpet shaped plastic that doesn't resemble a ""dart"" with a straight body and fins. They do not fly true and are not aerodynamic. It is always a guess as to where they will go. They are difficult to grasp for a decent throw.The package is probably ok for little kids who really aren't concerned with accuracy but even then it is vastly overpriced for the value. I previously owned one of the roll-up type magnetic dart board which was much less expensive and provided a better and more realistic experience."
75483,1,I ordered the small one so it would be easy to hand. I like the MSR name brand too. Yeah
400108,2,"So far so good. Let me preface by saying that I'm not a hardcore road biker; no races, don't have all the gear, etc. I use my $300 Motobecane to get me to and from work (6.5 miles away) everyday. Now, that being said, these tubes have been fine so far. I've had them on for about a month or two now and no punctures. I necessarily take a fairly puncture-prone path. Too bad I can't be reviewing this product 6 mos - 2 yrs after the fact (they claim two year puncture proof).I will say that I've also noticed I don't have to pump my tires nearly as often as I used to. I'm guessing the slime clogs microscopic holes that allow slow bleed.I don't notice the extra weight, but that's also because my Motobecane is heavy in the first place.It's not several months after the slime tubes have been installed. I have two somewhat success stories:1: I ride at 110 PSI. One day I noticed my tire was suddenly down to 40 PSI, must have been a leak. I pumped it back up to 110 PSI and spun my (rear) tire quickly to get the slime circulated around the wheel. No pressure loss after that; success!2: I had a puncture on my rear tire again while riding home. Tried to pump my rear tire but the hole was too large to hold any appreciable pressure above 10 PSI. Tried installing a normal tube, snake bit that one while putting it on. Retried my slime tube after ~ 30 minutes and successfully pumped it back up to 110 PSI....success? We'll see after several days of more riding. If it still works that'll mean it's self-healed after two somewhat major puncturesOctober 31: no go, it couldn't self-heal after the latest puncture and now I'm going to try to cash in on the 2-year guarantee.November 7: no word from manufacturer and too late to return to Amazon. I won't buy these again. Switched to Continental Gatorskin tires instead."
319531,0,"Got this for my wife, I use a handlebar mirror myself. First of all the adhesive holding the mirror to the helmet is very temporary. If fell off while my wife was riding but was not damaged. Resolved this by cementing the base on to the helmet with urethane cement (Aquaseal). Then after a couple of months the wire in the arm broke. Replaced the broken wire with an old stainless steel spoke. Then the ball joint broke. Permanently attached the mirror to the arm (spoke) with steel wire. Then mirror fell out of its mount. Fortunately my wife saw it fall out and recovered it. Cemented this in place with urethane cement. Now after all of that repair activity I moved the mirror to my wife's newest helmet and its been good for about 3 years with no further repair or work. A good design that would be a whole lot better made with more durable materials and better adhesives. Oh well."

Rubber you just take out and wash. Next time I will spend alil more on the rubber just cause they are more durable and easy to clean."

275695,0,The grips are being used on a new model blackhawk 41 mag. The gun has a trigger lock on it from the factory and it does not allow the grip retainer to be installed. The new one sent to me by hogue is actually a little smaller and does work but it scratches the blueing off the frame.
236121,0,"I bought this for my car after buying two bikes. It accomodates two bikes well, the problem is that youre scared that they are going to fall off while youre driving! All that holds the bikes in place are cloth straps and there are no dividers to seperate the bikes. As a result the bikes bang against one another."
388330,0,"These cleats performed nicely when hiking uphill or on level ground but tended to stretch and move around a little when coming downhill. Also, not comfortable for all day wear - the cleat footprint was small and put a lot of pressure on the ball and heel of your foot.Excellent price; great product for ""Light"" use."
241656,0,"Watch arrived dead. Returned. What looks like the same watch came back working now. Could well be just the battery as the earlier reviewer suggests.I've used this watch with snowshoes, exercise bike and snow blowing the driveway. It splits the exercise time into 5 zones based on heart rate and tells you the time (and percent) spent in each zone. Very nice. Lets me compare the workout of the exercise bike (known load) to other activities (like shoveling the driveway)).edit Sept 2011: I switched to a watch/gps that does HR. I like it much better. Consider getting the Garmin forerunner 305 -- for $150 it can track wear you are, pace, heart rate, etc. and upload them to your computer so you can see historical data. Its the only HR monitor I've used for the past two years."

134233,0,Not bad but it broke on the second day because ive never owned one before and didnt know i was supposed to push the loading bar thing foward after pulling it back... My fault on that one...

Im actually ordering another one just because the price is right
249355,0,"This fan was pretty much what I expected out of a battery operated fan. It did not provide much cooling, but did help circulate the air. I used it during the hottest part of the summer upper 90s during the days with lots of humidity. It was a good way to circulate air, but it did not do much more than that."
140766,1,Even with the rave reviews ( on all sites) I was not expecting to like this as much as I do. For someone who is starting back up with fitness actives it's great. If you are someone who's already fit and does a lot of gym or outside activities it may not be for you. But I love it. It helps that it's a game and you're almost doing circut training that incorporates activities like inline skating and power tennis to create a fun active rather than hating going to the gym and figuring out what to do with the limited time I have.I highly recommend it.
187916,0,"This target works as advertised, and provides varying levels of challenge with the adjustable target windows. However, the hardware that the target articulates on has a tendency to fall (or should I say fly) apart. When it does, good luck searching the yard for the parts. An easier solution is to put a regular bolt with a nylock nut on it, problem solved and it shouldn't fly apart again. With touch-up paint now and then, this target should stand up to a lot of abuse from pellet guns without fail."
507353,0,"I read the description of the gun and all the reviews and I thought, I have got to get this gun. I wanted this gun to use to shoot 6"" x 6"" targets 75' away.When I recieved the gun, I found it to be quite large, the length of the gun is over 8 inches, it didn't fit well in my hand, the weight was good though, it was well balanced. There is an extra safety thing on the back of the gun where your hands hold the gun, it's like a panel that you have to hold down or else the gun will not fire, this is something I really disliked about the gun. Another thing that I really hated about this gun is the magazine. You cannot speed load it, it is designed differently, so you have to push the bb's in one at a time.The gun has fixed hop up for .12g bb's, so when I shot it, I used .12's.After 70', .12's start to curve up.After 65', .20's start to curve down.From 35' away, I can hit a soda can 5/10 times with .12's.From 35' away, I can hit a soda can 6/10 times with .20's.So I did not see a real accuracy difference between the two different bb's at close range, so I advise using .12's if you buy this gun.So this is not a bad gun, I would still recomend buying it, awesome gun for $20, my expectations were just too high."
325475,1,My child loved this seat. She can see everything that I see. I started her in it when she was 9 months old. She is now 18 months and is getting a little to big for it. I think I can squeez another 3-4 months out of it. Highly recommend it.

456469,1,"I've been through a lot of capos and this is the nicest one I've used. Once you adjust the capo, it just slips on easily with no further adjustment. You can tune through the capo, at least as well as you can expect which is never quite as good as with no capo. Once it's tuned, it holds the tuning well.Regarding the ""partial capo"" that simulates DADGAD and open-A, it's an interesting idea, but anyone who is getting it to play songs they already know should realize that it isn't usable for any song that makes use of the second fret of the open strings (because capo blocks access to them). Unfortunately, that's all the songs I know in these tunings. However, someday when I have to time to try to learn new songs that take this into account, I think it's a neat idea that could be useful."
127866,1,"Seriously, I feel like this mat helps me fly in full locust. That's how awesome it is.I use this mat to do Bikram yoga every day. My studio has wood floors. This mat is solid, not springy, so in the balancing poses I feel stable and secure. In savasanah it feels supportive and strong. In fixed firm it provides enough padding for the knees.And it doesn't soak up any sweat, so it doesn't get gross. I pair this with 2 eQua towels from Manduka for my Bikram class, and I'm in yoga-equipment heaven.I got the extra-long mat even though I'm only 5' 6&#34;, and I'm glad I did. I have plenty of room in savasanah. Also, when I do an Ashtanga or Vinyassa class, I have plenty of room to move around on the mat, jump back into chataranga, etc.It is kinda heavy, so get a mat strap if you're walking or biking to yoga!"
467675,0,"I love the metal aspect. I am not a fan of pouring boiling liquid into plastic. That said, this is only a one cup french press and unless you leave the top inch or two free of water/coffee it squirts.I have tried gently pressing . . . ever so slowly, and with bare millimeters at a time. But it almost always squirts coffee and grounds out.I wish there was one of these that was double the size, then I wouldn't mind leaving the top inch or so free of water."
423972,0,"I bought this boat for my grandson to use at the beach. The ocean was rough, but my granddaughter and two of her cousins rode in the boat at the same time and had an absolute blast riding breakers in to the beach. The bottom inflates separately, so don't forget to inflate it as well. The only thing I really did not like is the inflation valve. It is one of those valves that comes on any cheap float or tube you buy at the beach. The Intex River Run tube I bought for my granddaughter had a heavy duty inflation valve that you could unscrew and it would deflate instantly. The valve on this boat (also an Intex product) you must squeeze together to let air out and it took a long, long time to deflate. If this boat had the same valve that comes on the River Rub tube I would give it 5 stars."
74462,1,"These arrived on the same day as my Nike Airmax shoes - never thought a thing about the socks - thought the Nikes were the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. Then I wore the socks with some uncomfortable boating sandals - they too felt the most comfortable ever! This has happened with all my shoes.It is astonishing, to me, that socks can have such a wonderful effect. A luxurious feel. I can recomend them."
411865,0,Serves its purpose but is a bit to thin. I use the waist trimmers for back support. The product does create sweat in the area which keeps your back warm but there are other producst that are somewhat thicker which gives greater back support. The product will not melt fat away without a healthy diet and exercise.
192454,1,These boots are made by Ariat. I have had shoes by this maker and ordered because of the quality of my other shoes.

280905,1,"After seeing all the poor reviews of the many different 12v powered coolers available here on Amazon, I was a little bit hesitant to purchase one myself. This one was the one with the least negative reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. I'm happy to report that the cooler worked well for my entire trip, covering 3 weeks, 3 days on the road. I was actually impressed with how cold it kept my drinks; it worked better than I'd expected, even on days when I had to leave it in a hot car for short amounts of time. At the end of some days, there was even ice on the cooling vanes.Some issues of note:This type of cooler is GREAT for keeping things cool, but not so much for cooling down something that's warm. If you possibly can, pre-cool your food and drinks in a fridge, and run the cooler for 30-60 min before loading it. If you can't do that, put something else frozen in with the warm stuff, like some of those freezer gel packs or bricks, or even frozen bottled water. That will help to cool things down more quickly. Don't use loose ice, though; if enough of it melts, the water will block the cooling vanes, which pretty much makes the cooler useless (and if the water level gets high enough, it could damage the cooler's motor).The cooler doesn't do anything about humidity, so if it's a humid day, or you put items with condensation in the cooler, you'll probably end up with a small amount of water in the bottom of the cooler when you unload it again later. Placing a small towel in the cooler helps. Leaving one underneath the aforementioned cooling vanes when you unload the cooler overnight is good too; that way if any ice formed in there, it gets soaked up when it melts. Wiping it out nightly is definitely a good idea.Speaking of which, those cooling vanes have some slightly sharp edges. Be careful when wiping around the bottom of the vanes; they could scrape a knuckle pretty good.The unit cools with circulated air, so there has to be at least some room for air to circulate inside it. You can't pack this cooler completely full. Not a huge deal for me, but if you have a need to haul that much stuff in a powered cooler, then you're going to need a bigger one. Also, loading the cooler with cans is slightly awkward, because the cooling unit is in the middle of one side of the cooler, and 'sticks out' into the interior by about 3cm. I squeezed in some bottled water, since the plastic bottles are a little bit 'squishy', to keep my cans from rattling and sliding in the cooler.Finally, it's kind of cheap that the unit doesn't come with a wall adapter. I'm not complaining too hard, but unless you plan on staying someplace with a fridge every night while on your trips, you're going to need the optional adapter. You can't leave this thing hooked up overnight in a vehicle; it'll drain the battery.Otherwise, yeah, it was great. I'd recommend it to anyone considering traveling with a cooler. It sure beats dealing with an ice chest."
473599,0,"This Nissan 26-oz thermos is usable, but not nearly the quality of the one I used a few years ago, which was made in Japan, and sparkled with quality. Here's the problem with this product: the screw-cover just doesn't smoothly screw in, and always requires 3 tries to get the grooves lined up to the satisfaction of the cranky item. OK, other than that, yes, it keeps the coffee hot from 6:00am to 4:00pm, so I'm not complaining too much."
78595,0,"My best friend, Keith and I recently spent 8 days in Canada sitting on the Slumberjack Seat. The portability and comfort of the Slumberjack made it an ideal addition to our adventure. With a few additions to the strapping system the seat provided much needed back support. The only negative is the weak plastic buckling system. Keith's broke on the first day of use and a duct taping engineering feet had to be performed.I would recommend the Slumberjack Seat for those that seek canoe adventures where weight and packability are concerns."

Disappointing for what they used to be. If you don't mind a thinner cotton shirt, this one is good."
262667,0,"The Thule No-Sway Cage does a great job holding my bike in place. I would have given it a 5 out of 5 stars but it chipped the paint off my bike! Like the guy said in an earlier review...I wish I would have known it did this because it could have easily been avoided. I put weather stripping on it and it works great...no paint chipping! This really upset me because I paid a lot of money for my mountain bike and the manufacturer of my bike does not sell touch up paint! Also, I called Thule and they are aware of this problem. They said the No-Sway Cage does not chip the paint off all bikes, just some! Thank you Thule for selling a product that does this. Again, this product works great and holds your bike in place....just make sure you put something on it...like weather stripping or some kind of soft pad. Make sure you take the No-Sway Cage off when you are riding and keep it in your car...it can easily be stolen if left on the bike rack."

238131,0,"This holster is marketed as a great holster for concealed carry but it only works for that if you wear a jacket (at least with a Glock 19). The gun sits in the holster with the barrel closer to your body which causes the handle of the gun to stick out from your body and show through a t-shirt. Some will argue that if you want to conceal under a t-shirt to get an inside the pants holster but I disagree. I used to carry my Sig 1911 in a generic paddle holster and it printed less than the much smaller Glock 19. I have also noticed that the holster ""rocks"" a little in that the pistol handle moves in and out from your body as you walk. I prefer a more solid holster where it doesn't move at all. Finally, the inside part of the paddle had some sharp hard rubber nubs on it that I had to file / sand down because they poked into my hip causing discomfort. They were clearly a result of the manufacturing process and should have been snipped down at the factory.Besides those things above the holster is fine. The retention screw works great. I can draw the pistol out of the holster with no problem and the gun won't just pop out of the holster if you hold it upside down or roll on the ground. The trigger is completely covered which is excellent for carrying a Glock or any other gun that doesn't have an actual external safety.I have to decide if the problems that I have with it are enough to get a different holster for every day carry. I got this one because IDPA doesn't allow the Serpa holsters. However, I've found the Serpa holsters to be really good. So I got this one thinking I'd use it for both daily carry and competition. But with the issues above... I may get the Serpa for daily wear and only use this one for competition."

Easy to install, and easy to mount the bike securely. My only recommendation would be to also use a bungie coord to secure your bike's front wheel. Used the rack on my 95 Honda Civic. Recommended."

301866,1,"Classic Diver Automatic Watch: If Caterpillar Earth Moving Equipment Company bought out Rolex Watch Company, this is the watch that would most likely be built by the new company (Rolexpiller?). This watch is built like a chrome plated tank, it is an Automatic like the best Rolexes (Read NO Battery), which means it never needs to be opened, and is impervious to the things that kill other watches before breakfast. Perfect for a new Marine going overseas. Some don't understand the beauty of an ""Automatic Watch"" you need to wear it to wind it, but for those who need an extra durable, always reliable, brutally elegant watch look no further. From Quantico to Baghdad and back, you'll always know when to break for lunch, and the chicks dig it too. Note of caution: This watch is not for wussies. Photos by: John Davis"

81052,1,VERY QUIET AND NOT TOO HARD TO ASSEMBLE. 300 POUNDS IS NOT RECOMMENDED WITH ME. I AM 130LBS NOW AND I NOTICE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS ONE AND THE ONE I PAID TWO YEARS AGO AND PAID ALOT MORE. I AM HAPPY NOW! BUT IF I WAS TRYING TO LOOSE WEIGHT FROM 300 LBS OR A LITTLE LESS I MIGHT BE A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED. YOU NEED TO TIGHTEN BOLTS. OTHERWISE I AM HAPPY BECAUSE I LOST MY WEIGHT AND I JUST WANT TO KEEP IT OFF. THE SHIPPING WAS AWESOME! I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT IT SO SOON!!
117392,1,"A bit of an overstatement, but this is one of the better sets I've seen. I'd love to get my hands on the set they award at the World Series of Poker, just to compare (really :-) ; however, the one they sell on the WSOP site is an aluminum case and this mahogony case is really much nicer. The brass fixtures are a very nice touch and add to the overall look and feel of an impressive and expensive set. What is not mentioned in the product details is that it also includes a dealer, big blind and small blind chip, nice touch for the serious poker player.I had mentioned a few years ago that I'd like to have a nice poker set for Christmas and did get ""a poker set"" just not one up to my standards. It served it's purpose, but will be replaced by this one.I initially purchased this one to use as part of a centerpiece in a display for a charity event and either kept after the event or auctioned off at the end of the event. Much as I believe in contributing to the charity, and I really, really do, the charity will have to settle for a cash donation instead. Saves me having to order another one.If you're looking for a very nice, impressive poker set, this is the one."
77360,1,Unit works as it should. The only negative is that the unit has to be mounted on the downtube. Other brands have more range and can be mounted further back. Haven't not had to change the battery yet. We will see how long it lasts.
158321,1,"Its Big! Level 2 seems like it will be an easy build. Just got to get the paint right. Just finished an F22 Raptor Lvl 3, so this will be a nice break. May try and get some nose art ordered. Nice piece, not near as hard as the Raptor by Haseqawa."
77927,0,"This seems like a pretty nice piece of equipment, however I haven't been able to use it yet. When I opened the box, it was missing the back pad, all the hardware to assemble it and the instruction manual. I called the company and they were very helpful and said they would put the parts in the mail. 10 days later (too long), I received the missing parts in the mail, but they failed to send the back pad. I called back again, and they are shipping me the back pad, which has been 5 more days now. They really should put a little more rush on their products that were not included with the equipment. The equipment itself seems to be built pretty well and seems like a good deal for the price. Although, I haven't really got to test it yet!! There are a couple of ends that go on the front legs that have adjustments on them, and they have both already cracked from moving the unit around, so they might be kind of cheap. All and all, it seems okay though and worth the money. They just need to make sure the parts are in the box."
187575,1,This tool seems to have it all. I'm new to cycling and in the period of a month I've used this tool on numerous occasions including the chain break. Works fantastic and I would highly recommend.
340072,2,"This pedometer worked well until the clip broke after about 3 months-without the clip, it loses accuracy to the point where there's no point to wearing it. We attempted to contact the manufacturer on a number of occasions but they are unresponsive. Given the way the product is used, the fragility of the clip is disappointing and the inability to get a new one is frustrating. We can't find any way on Omron's website to even purchase a new clip."
150362,0,"I purchased the navy bag after quickly looking at the picture, and thinking it was black. It's definitely NOT black - a medium blue hue of navy at that. It's not remotely dark or black as it looks in the picture. Otherwise, the bag is just fine - the quality is good and there is a nice small zippered pouch on the back which I've found useful."
315906,0,"These were very cheap pants, and as the saying goes; you get what you pay for. Everything seems to stick to these pants because of the cheap material. They are sufficient for just a workout, but far from something you would want to wear in a demo or any display!"
163301,0,"Spent the first night in the tent in the backyard as a trial run before our camping trip. The tent went up fairly easy (needs two people, but with a 9-person tent it is easy to find one other person). Tent appears to be well made, like the other two Eureka tents we have. The problem is with the zippers on the doors. You have to be very careful or you will zip into the tent material. This happened in the middle of the night and when I tried to release the zipper, the zipped part above the zipper came undone. I had to go out another door. I fixed the zipper in the morning, but am disappointed that the zippers are not the same quality as my two other tents. I bought a Eureka, because of the quality I have previous enjoyed. I gave the tent a three because of the difficulty of zipping the doors. Otherwise I would have given it a 5."
115483,0,"I got the brand I ordered, but I ordered these specifically because I liked the colors shown in the picture. They sent me blah gray colored arrows INSTEAD but of the same good quality make. They will suffice for the function of target shooting I need them for but I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get exactly what I asked for. Next time I will spend the gas money to drive an hour into and all the way across town to pick out my arrows at the pro shop. In total with the gasoline expense the price probably evens out the same.... but I would have the colors I picked out which was part of the SELLING POINT of these online. I have learned."

255211,0,"These work as intended, meaning when you're holding Down Dog in your sweaty Bikram class you can actually hold it rather than ending up in the less-graceful Embarrassed Starfish pose.I bought two: Lakshmi - Poppy for my beau and Ganesha - Teal for myself.This particular color (Lakshmi - Poppy) is gorgeous for exactly one wash, then it fades to a much more subdued ruby-burgundy.When they say wash it before use, DO IT.Trust me.Nothing I have laundered in years has bled as much as these towels. It took five wash/dry attempts (done gently and per instructions) before I got minimal enough bleeding. I still probably wouldn't trust these towels with very light-colored clothing + a sweaty, hot class. Also, the surface isn't particularly soft. I guess I expected a little more of a cottony feel, but the towels definitely do the job. (I found Yoga Rat towels, without nubs, at a discount store, and those work just as well without the color bleed.)"
239769,0,I purchased the stove from Amazon with no shipping cost but it didn't include the fuel. The Amazon shipped the product promptly and packed it well but you can save substantually if you just make a run to your local camping supply or sports supply center.

49280,0,"Reading the comments on this device made me glad that I bought the MSR Universal Canister Stand -- available at Amazon.com.The MSR model has metal legs and are longer/more stable. The comments on the legs breaking, and that they are plastic are negatives to me.So, I would check out MSR's before buying this one. This one looks like it might be smaller and lighter. List price is cheaper, but the shipping costs completely negate that unless you use one of Amazon's free shipping techniques.I'm not trying to warn anyone away from this one, just be aware of a good alternative. And then take your pick."

160036,0,"Have had these for daughter for a few months. No problems so far, though use has been minimal. Have been used on driveway and at roller rink. One complaint is that the tongue is rather narrow, and can slide to the side too easily. Main complaint is that top ""D"" shaped clips for lacing upper part of boot are made of plastic, unfortunately. They haven't broken yet, but my fear is that they will with extended use. Otherwise, skate is made well, good wheels, nice look. Would have been nice to be able to adjust how fast wheels roll to help out beginners."

However, the tension was so tight I could barely pedal. The only way I can describe it, is it felt like I was trying to use an electrical bike in the ""off"" position. I talked to customer service who were very nice and recommended some WD40. They said if that still didn't work, then it was defective and to send back for a full refund. It didn't work. So I sent it back."

464312,2,"I bought the Invicta 2959 Lady Abyss after admiring the look of this Divers style watch and reading several positive reviews. I am pleased with the quality of the materials used, the size, color, style, and comfort. However, the lack of attention to detail and quality control by Invicta is severely lacking. The bezel is off center and the second hand is slightly off the mark, so every time I glance at the time piece I notice these obvious flaws. I have several watches, from Rolex to Fossil and this Invicta is the first time piece that is truly disappointing."
510355,0,"I ordered two of these air mattresses to fit into a tent I purchased to go camping with my 8 year old son. They just fit into the tent and were a little cumbersome, but the blower provided blew them up in minutes and they were better than sleeping on the floor! I somehow managed to kick the plug in the middle of the night and it deflated rather quickly I unfortunately found out and I didn't want to wake up the camp at 4 AM so make sure it's in tight before you try to go to sleep!"

135544,0,"Shaun T is good, the workouts are fast paced and for the most part pretty good. Some of the girls are incredibly annoying and the only person who consistently performs the exercises with correct form is Shaun T. My main problem with Beachbody is that they sold me a defective product. I purchase the deluxe edition which had 2 bonus DVDs. However, when I finally played the bonus DVDs it turned out they were completely messed up! It looked like they had been edited by a 5 year old who started at the end of the work out and worked forwards. It makes me think that all of the DVDs are probably edited. I contacted Beachbody to exchange these terribly made DVDs and they wouldn't even stand behind their product to exchange the DVDs for me. What kind of company won't exchange a faulty product? On a whole the product is decent, you can find most of it online for free though, but Beachbody's customer service is inadequate."

74519,2,"I purchased these bases to play backyard wiffle-ball with a five year old.The Good:Lightweight, portable, and brings a child's imagination alive as he plays ball in his home 'stadium'.The Bad:These bases are constructed of very thin, flexible rubber that developed several cracks and holes after only a few hours of barefoot baseball. In addition to the poor material, these bases are extremely shiny and white; you may think that will make them easy to see but look at a base in the bright sun without a donning welding mask and you may never see again!

256690,0,"Working in a ski shop I get knowledge of products and the freedom to choose at a inconsequential price what I want. Oakley definitly makes the best lens. I have the A-frame, but I also have some other goggles including the Smith Triad and some mid-priced Scotts. The lens in Oakleys gives the best sight (I use the high intesity persimmon sens). Works great in all conditions EXCEPT bright sunlight.HOWEVER......Oakely A-frames are notorious for fogging, despite anti-fog treatement and venting. They do it to me, and therefore I cannot wear them on days when it is snowing, which is unfortunate b/c that is when I need that grade A, Oakley lens the most.All in all, I ski about 100 days a year and 90 of those days I use my A-frames. (Although I admit it is also because they are way cuter than my other goggles, and a girl has got to look good.) ;)"
467041,0,"The Ramline stock for the Ruger 10/22 was about what I expected in terms of the thickness of the plastic and the overall fit (1/8 inch gap at back of receiver. side to side just fine), little thin on the back end. What really disappointed me was that I was searching for a plastic youth stock and this one hyped up that it was adjustable by two inches. That really did not leave me thinking that I would be cutting 2 inches off of a hollow plastic stock which did not have enough beef left, or clear guide holes for screws at that length. I have the necessary skills to make this work, but it was a lot more effort than I was signing on for. I found the advertising deceptive. ANY full length stock can be reduced by two inches by the simple expedient of chopping it off, When I contacted the manufacturer, I eventually received an e-mail back suggesting that I take it to a trained gunsmith to reduce the length. Not what their advertising indicated. Buyer Beware. If you want a full sized stock pay a bit more for the rubber over molded one from their competitor, since it cannot be easily cut down. Cosmetically this one does not suffer from cutting, and gives you a cool hollow butt for equipment, but it is a lot of work making a custom plug/ butt plate."

2819,0,"The overall vest was good. However, on the elastic portion where the sewn on velcro begins seemed to be a weak area. only after a few uses it began to tear. To keep the vest from moving around during a workout, I would pull on the elastic straps to get a snug fit. The elastic strap is what began to tear on both sides. Maybe this could be reinforced with velcro sewn on the entire straps. Thank you."
433223,1,Right after I purchased this I was shot in the throat by a paintball and I didn't feel a thing. Could use a little more material towards the back of the neck but it still does the job.

257955,0,"Hoping to get rid of tennis elbow pain, I read quite a few reviews of competing products on Amazon. Due to large number of positive reviews versus other products that do the same thing, I settled on this one. Although I have not worn it long enough yet to experience relief of the inflammation of tennis elbow (couple weeks now), I can say this. Obviously you need to wear it tight enough to restrict interaction of the forearm muscle with the tendon connected to the elbow bone. But in so doing, it does cut off circulation even though it appears that, as a two part brace, it might not do so, where the straps ""only"" are in contact with the arm.When you cinch it down adequately, the straps do compress the forearm flesh and muscle, cutting off circulation, contrary to their marketing claims. So I have had to loosen it up a bit, but when I make a fist and move my hand around to activate the muscle interaction with the tendon, I can tell that it is not restraining muscle activity enough to appear to relieve stress on the tendon. I am judging this by feeling the muscle action between the brace, and the tendon and I can feel it flexing more than it does when I have it tighter and properly restrained.But the most uncomfortable thing about this product, is that the edges of the velcro strap are very thin and thus a bit sharp along the outer edges, beyond the soft part of the velcro itself, where the strap has been ""heat cut"" to prevent unraveling and fraying. Not to the point that they would literally cut you, but certainly uncomfortable over several hours of use. So the real weak point in this product is the velcro strap. If they could figure out a way to get rid of the abrupt and relatively sharp edge, it would enhance comfort in wearing over extended periods."
76312,0,"Love the fabric - very soft, not too heavy but not as thin as most tights. Problem was the rise. Seem to be a bit short/low-rise style although not advertised that way, when pulled up to natural waistline, became very uncomfortable in the crotch, no way I could ride in them. Never experienced this before in a riding tight or breech, not sure what the problem is, but where most tights/breeches have a panel in the crotch area, these just have a seam. Sent them back."
283582,1,"It's as good for me if not better than most of the $12 gloves I've bought.It does seem a bit more snug than most XLs, so I believe the reviews who said they have size problems.On the other hand (no pun intended) I don't believe that this glove is not durable. I've been using mine for at least 10 rounds and it's still in perfect working shape."
496913,0,Based on the above reviews I did not buy the Horizon product because I did not want to hassle with the problems of putting it together. We went and bought a ProForm and the assembly was easy and the bolts fit!!So did not know if we would have had trouble with the Horizon but did not take time or effort to find out. The Proform XP works great and was about $100 less (on sale) than the Horizon T71.

On the ruffwear website it shows a dog hiking in them... I hope my dog becomes less enamored with removing them or I can come up with a way to adapt them. I will see if training him to ""leave it"" works...."
252966,1,"These things are amazingly warm for their thickness. I have these and a couple sets of the Cross Country pants, and I'm extremely pleased with both. This are lightweight, can be worn indoors, and have open, not zip, pockets (this might be important to someone buying them as a running pant). I use them running, hiking, primarily but also when weightlifting in an unheated basement. For hiking, be aware they are not really for off trail, the fabric would snag too easily.The sizing comment in the review is dead on, Sporthill's XXL is everyone else's XL. I talked with the manufacturer about this, they were apparently unaware of it. The pants are loose, but not enough to make up for undersizing.I haven't had any problems washing them as the one review describes. You don't want to put them in the dryer, but they readily air dry. Actually, thinking about it, these may be able to go in the dryer and the other ones can't, but I air dry them regardless as I just don't put my Sporthill stuff in the dryer in general. Washing is fine though."

404572,0,"Ordered this thinking it was a set, because the picture of each size shows a set, yet it was not. Can't return it because the papers that came in the box were shredded and messy, return label was already removed from the sheet, not that I could be bothered to return it.

There was an iinsert telling me where I could buy some, but I was really disappointed that the needle was not included or that there was nothing on the site that told me that they were not included. Why would they not have included or at least be listed as an extra to be purchased. I assumed that the needles pictured with the unit were for it but they were hand needles. Bummer!I am an idiot. The needles were in the handle for anyone with a brain to find. The awl is ""awlsome."" I used it to replace the soles of my ""slipper socks"" and it worked wonderfully."
65018,1,"We got a Razor A Scooter from Grandma that was kept outdoors for several years and used occasionally by visiting grandchildren. The Scooter still rode as smoothe as silk after all those years. So smoothe that I allowed my 4 kids (ages 4-12) to ride it in my house on the wood floors. I got tired of them constantly fighting over the scooter, so I broke down and ordered 3 more... each in a different color. That definitely solved the fighting problem. Now I ask for a turn haha. I need to order one for me :) My ONLY complaint is the metal clamp on one of the scooters fell apart (in about 5 pieces) the second day we had it. I put it back together, but it's still loose. We can't adjust the scooter highth on that one either. Other than that, it still works fine, and the highth seems to work for everyone. I recommend these scooters."
417135,0,"Overall the product seems very good but not appropriate for all glass sizes. The material feels somewhat like a sweatshirt. My disappointment is that the ends are 2 large for most of my glasses, and the glasses slip out. When these arrived, an attached tag stated ""large end"". The item description states ""standard end"". Had ""large end"" been indicated in the item description I would not have bother to order these. They are an acceptable fit on one pair or RayBan's that are thicker around the ear but I rarely use those. It looks like they will fit fine on glasses that have at least a medium width temple cover (the part of the frame around your ear). You may want to avoid these if you have thin plastic or wire frames with thin temple covers as I have both and those glasses slip out too easily.If my glasses had thicker ends these might get 5 stars but they are useless with thin/small end glasses and incorrectly described by the seller as ""standard-end"" when they shipped ""large-end""."

218274,0,"Well, if you read my review of the Coleman sit-inside kayak, if I had to choose between the sit-on-top and the sit-inside version of these inflatables, I'd choose th sit-inside every time. Because unless you weigh under 100 lbs., you are going to have a very wet ride on the SOT.Aside from that this didn't seem to quite have the speed or stability of the sit-inside (and I wouldn't consider either one FAST by any stretch of the imagination). I took both kayaks out under the same conditions on the same day, on a lake with no breeze.The main thing this kayak has going for it is the price! If you just use it two or three times, it's a whole lot cheaper than renting a kayak, but you just will not get the same performance as a hard shell.If you need an incentive to get outside and get a bit of exercise, it's great for a leisurely day of paddling on still water. I wouldn't recommend this for any kind of tidal waters -stick to lakes and ponds that have minimal motor boat traffic. Stash a couple bottles of gatorade under the cargo net and you're good to go.Also, I'd suggest that you wear a life preserver because the canvas simply isn't as heavy as some of the more expensive inflatable kayaks on the market.The paddle could stand to be a bit longer and I would strongly recommend buying a battery operated pump to accompany this boat. It will easily inflate in under five minutes once you are familiar with the procedure. You'll always have a few onlookers while blowing this boat up and you might actually wind up selling a few on the Coleman.If you're looking for a serious kayak, get a hard shell. If you just want a quick trip on the water every now and then and aren't looking too deeply at performance, this would probably serve you just fine. Just make sure you bring a dry pair of shorts!"
37111,1,"I decided to try the MP1 purification tablets and use them as a backup to my filter when backpacking. When the temperature is above freezing, I always use a Katadyn Vario filter, which is amazing. But I wanted to have a backup should this filter ever malfunction beyond repair in the field. I don't want to rely on boiling water due to fuel usage or building a fire.Since I have a VERY good sense of smell, I never bothered trying iodine after hearing about the smell and taste. I was curious about the MP1 tablets so I treated 1 liter of tap water just to test it before using it in the field. After being treated for 2 hours in a Nalgene, I noticed a very slight chlorine-like odor, similar to when you walk into a hotel with a pool - the air has that fresh smell. I drank a few ounces and could not taste anything at all. If you gave me some of this water without knowing it was treated, I would have no idea. Actually, some cities I've been to have tap water that smells just like this. I compared it to my tap water from a 3-stage filtration system several times and could not tell the difference. I even poured some water into a glass from the Nalgene which removed the odor completely, so shaking the water and leaving the top off for a minute or so would nearly eliminate the odor. Again, the odor is so slight it shouldn't bother anyone when drinking.When backpacking, I'll probably use the full recommended 4 hours to treat my water. This product is so convenient I would even recommend it to others as a primary method of water purification depending on the source. If you plan on a lot of sediment, a filter is still my first choice, plus it gives you immediate access to the water."

This adapter won't work with a lot of the cheap electric air compressors currently being sold. A work around (assuming the chuck can be disassembled) is temporarily removing the chuck's valve."

380598,1,"I just pop it into my pocket every morning when I get dressed and I don't think about it for the rest of the day. It's quietly counting every step without demanding attention from me -- no jabbing me in the waist or popping off of my waistband. The step counter is accurate and it was easy to calibrate. I recently started passing 11,000 steps on my ""long walk"" days, which makes me very happy. On my ""couch potato"" days, peeking at my Omron gets me moving (1,200 steps? eeek!)I haven't started using the software yet, but so far I am super pleased with this pedometer."

263020,1,"The product works as advertised. I bought it mainly to replace all of the bottled water that we seem to buy and refillable plastic bottles we have with BPA's. I fill up this bottle before local shopping trips, or jaunts in the car or on the bike. I keep it in the fridge and grab it and go. I also set it in a shady spot in the yard while working outside. The spout is hard to open and close and seems very cheaply made for the bottle, plus it doesn't let air in as you drink and you almost have to suck the water out. Unscrew the cap off and your good to go. That's the way I do it most of the time. The bottle sweats quite a bit with cold water, but I expected that. I will not be putting it on my desk or any wood surfaces at home. Not a problem for me. The 1 liter capacity is just right for me, but I will be buying other family members this bottle in the smaller size (.6 liter) as they don't chug quite as much water as I do. I very much like the idea that I'm not adding another plastic bottle to the landfills. That is the overriding positive about this bottle. I would recommend this product and the companies products in general. Good quality except for that plastic spout."
342875,1,"I've had lots of experience with Pelican cases in the field and know they can't be beat for reliable waterproof protection and ruggedness. I bought this case to mount on the rear rack of my dual-sport motorcycle, as way to safely carry my digital SLR camera gear or a laptop computer on the bike. The case is perfect. Lockable and watertight, as well as aesthetically pleasing. I will be buying two more larger ones to mount as side panniers as well."
377127,0,I bought this for my 6 year old son. It's much too heavy for him to pull. I figure it's best for ages 8 and up. Got him a Bear bow with lighter pull and he loves that. Once he grows into this one I think it'll work well too.
341545,1,"My dad used this around me for deer hunting in 1961, and I shot my first buck! Last year I placed around my daughter's bow stand, and she had the buck there, but behind her, and never had a shot. It spooked when she turned. This stuff worked 50 years ago, and still works!"
345586,1,"We used this for money, credit cards, room key, safe key, etc. and we took it swimming, snorkeling, and everywhere. It was my husband's wallet while on vacation in the Cancun area. There was never a drop of water in there. Everything was dry as a bone. I expected it to get some moisture in so I ordered an AquaPac for more valuable items, but this worked as well. However, it's small so I'm glad I had a larger-sized AquaPac. The money & cards fit tightly in this. Also, a previous reviewer mentioned folding the cardboard that comes inside the wallet before removing it. Such wise advice. I can see how you could easily tear or poke a hole in this plastic if you try to pull out that cardboard insert. Do fold it first before trying to remove it."
202117,1,This is one of the only true estrus doe calls made. I have called in at least 5 bucks some Whitetail and some Mullies with this call.

204383,0,"I really liked this cup, and bought it based on the reviews. It kept her milk cold, and did not leak. However, my daughter came home from school less than a month after purchase, and the straw was torn. I always noticed that it was a bit too long to easily shut the top, and in her attempt to close the lid, it snapped the top of the straw off. I am hoping that it was just defective to begin with, as this didn't seem to be a problem in other reviews. I returned it to Amazon, and will be trying again with the same kind, since it is still so highly reviewed. Hoping for better luck the second time around."

The thing will spray out more water than not without really working at it. Got a super cold soaking one cold night before I was able to make it stop leaking! Would have been simpler for them to make it properly to begin with. Its usable since there is no alternatives."
239272,0,"Go to your local sports store. They have offical baseballs there for much cheeper. In fact I'm sure the price was raised on these since that last time I bought them (2 years ago). Oh and ""6 D-OB"" doesn't mean 6 dozen. (I'm a noob at baseball) it means 6 Dimond Offical Baseballs. However I am good at math at around $30 for the bag / 6 balls thats roughly $5 a ball & thats a hefty cost. You can almost get dozzen for the price of 1 ball."
420778,0,"I ordered two of these, they arrived quickly and well packaged. Opened them up and one worked great and the other did not roll. I returned it and purchased a replacement.mMy replacement arrived and the roller was popped out of the card pusher and did not work. After smashing my finger and hurting my wrist I was able to pop it back in and make it work. Another note the third one I recieved with the popped out roller came all scratched up and has air bubbles in the plastic, looks weren't important for playing the games we used it for but it might be to you."
298614,1,"My wife said we needed to put my handguns in a safe, because our grandchild / teenagers might be able to get at my guns when we are not at home. I agreed and looked for a solution that would allow me to keep a gun loaded and ready but still safe form little hands. This safe fits the bill perfectly. It is quick to open with plenty of self programed codes to open the safe quickly. The door is even spring loaded for quick access. A small light comes on when you open the safe so you can see for short time what your doing. It holds two handguns without holsters and stores plenty of ammo. I'm happy, wife's happy and the kids are safe. I consider this a best buy for anyone with handguns and little ones about. GOD bless you all and GOD bless America!Sincerely,Lovebandit"

503432,1,"TNA lockdown was a good ppv, the matches I list, I won't tell you who wins because this dvd is worth buying. All matches are held inside a six sides of steel cage.Match 1: Sonny siaki and Apolo vs Chris Candido and Lance Hoyt. Chirs Candido breaks his leg in this match, but as for the match goes its ok, Good opener 5/10.Match 2: Price of darkness match, Dustin Rhodes vs Bobby Rode. A prince of darkness match is 2 out of 3 falls match and if it goes to the third fall both wrestlers will be blind foled. The match is pretty good with some high spots 6/10.Match 3: X Division Xscape Match, Matt Bentley vs Sonjay Dutt vs Chris Sabin vs Shocker. This is a good match with alot of highflying action and shows why the X Division is some of the most talented athletes in the world 8/10.Match 4: Tables Match, Raven vs ""The Charismatic Enigma"" Jeff Hardy. This match is great with alot of hardcore action. Jeff Hardy takes some big leaps 8/10.Match 5: NWA World Tag Team Title Match, AMW VS Team Canada.

309744,1,"I used to have trouble telling where I hit a target, specially when it reaches a certain distances. Most of the the time, I would have to bring my targets back to be able to clearly identify where my shot hit. During one of my range trips, a friend brought a few of these targets. He let me try one. And after using it for the first time, I immediately ""fell in love"" with it. The bullet hole is marked pretty clear by a neon ring. It is nice to be able to adjust your aim and shot depending on where your previous ones hit. Plus, since it is an adhesive type, I could use the same board/paper target I had over and over again. I just slap this target over the one I was using and I have a clean slate. The target also comes with some patches that you could use to cover up the holes that you made. With the patches, I could use the same target with 2-3 clips, depending on how ripped the target gets, specially when shots are ""pooled"" or grouped to a certain area. Overall, I am very satisfied with this item. I don't see myself shooting at any other target any time soon."

I used this on them and his spots cleared up in a few weeks. The vets didn't know what to give me other then expensive ointments or pills to knock him out. I said screw them and spoke to a family friend of mine. She referred me to ""pulvex"". Gave me a little bit and it worked. Come to find out they don't make it anymore and this is the replacement for it I guess. Same ingredients as the pulvex. My dog actually likes it I think. He rolls over now when I get it out."

354292,0,"After reading many reviews, I purchased a pair and thought these would be a good choice for my practice. The shoes themselves are very well built and seem like they will stay together. There was another review that cautioned against the ""round"" edges on the sole. I think for a more active practice this is less of an issue, however, doing stance work and circle walking, I find that these shoes are very difficult and won't work. The edges are very rounded off and unless my foot is perfectly aligned with the center of the sole, it's like trying to walk on small canoe bottoms. Over exaggerated yes, but the feeling is unfortunate when my foot keeps rolling in and out. So, I am going to keep these around for Capoeira and some other more active practices, however, my search continues for a well built martial art shoe that can keep the foot stable. Overall, I wouldn't recommend these for anyone who is doing a Nei Gong practice, Taiji, Qi Gong, or otherwise..."

4954,2,"At first it looked strong enough that I bought it as a tent for my B.O.B., but when I got it (and looked it up on youtube), it seems REALLY thin and weak.It's certainly better than nothing, and would probably hold up to rain and super light wind, but I'm only keeping it as a back up (the saying goes, if you have one you have none; and if you have 2 you have 1)I'll give it this, it's very small and fits nicely in my bug out bag, and if for some reason I'm with or encounter someone, while camping or whatever, who needs a tent I can easily give them this and not really bat an eye.I ended up dishing out 25 dollars and getting an actual tent (on sale at big 5), that could go with my Bug Out Bag.As a last resort, backup, it's not a horrible tent, it's small / light enough that you'd actually take it with you for that purpose. But as a primary tent or anything that you actually expect that you would sleep in, I really can't say that it's a good tent.lesson learned, splurge and spend a little money to get a real tent or even a good tarp that's long/wide enough to suit this purpose. Even a cheap tarp of the right size would be better than this tent actually.NOTE: I did not take it out of the bag (i want to keep it compact and easy to pack) but even without taking it out, it's pretty easy to see it's weak.DO A YOUTUBE SEARCH ON THIS PRODUCT BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT."
442934,2,"First, the material is strangely thick and stiff for athletic shorts. This would be good material for sweats in cold weather but these are shorts so all it does is collect sweat. The shorts are poorly shaped with oversized legs. This feels odd due to the stiff material. I feel like I'm running inside them instead of wearing them and I imagine this looks a little funny. Finally, no pockets limit their usefulness. Unless you need to save ten bucks, look at other pairs."
229493,1,"I would rather practice my martial arts bare foot any day, but there are times when you need something to protect your feet while you're practicing. My Kickboxing instructor has a shoes policy, and he didn't care for my more hiking style of shoes. Well, I got these, and they cover all the bases. Not great for driving, or if you want a lot of traction, but they are exactly what you need for working a heavy bag, or just simple in gym work. You could run in them, but it's not worth it unless it's in the middle of class. In all, it's the right price for a great pair of shoes. BTW, you may want to order a little small on these, as mine are just on the loose side of things, and there's limited overlap of the sides. (I typically buy US 11 these days, and I think I could have gone with a 44 instead of a 45)"

312503,2,I have a small head and I have been a small in all other helmets and decided to purchase the small for the ProTech helmet. I didn't read the previous reviews which I wish I had. There is a lot of padding in this helmet which is why the helmet was so TINY. It didn't come close to fitting my head so I thought I would give it to my 10 year old daughter. The helmet didn't fit her either and I ended up giving it to my friend's 3 year old daughter which it ended up fitting her perfectly!
493376,0,"I really want to like this product. It is decent size, not annoyingly tiny. In fact, it is 2/3 the size of a full-size table. It also perfectly fit on top of our dining table (7' x 3.5'). The playing surface is good enough for the ball to bounce reasonably well. It even folds up and is light enough to be carried on outings and events.BUT, the grind is, the table top folds in 2 places. This is NOT mentioned anywhere in the description, and is not apparent in the pictures either. I assumed it folded in one place, right under where the net would mount. Probably should have researched more, but didn't occur to me at that time.Anyway, the 2 folds end up being on the 2 halves on either side of the net. They are about 1.16 foot from the net. The fold has seams that do protrude out a little - just a wee bit, but enough to affect ball bounce. The table top has metal hinges at the ends of the folds. the hinges affect bounce too. The table top corners have a triangular pastic cap that fell off immediately. It didn't affect play, but just wanted to mention how flimsy it is.Overall, I could have probably played a mid-distance game on this table top, but mind you, this is a 2/3 size anyway, so you cannot really adjust and improvise that much. It is more suited to a short game, and that does get affected badly by the way it folds in 2 places.The paddles that come with it are a joke, but you could make it a fun game out of them if you like. The net is nothing to speak about, it mounts easily, but is not taut enough. It is also shorter than the regular net.Unfortunately, I had to return it to Amazon. Hopefully, the manufacturer will take note of the feedback and make some amends to what could be potentially be a really good product."

21387,1,I am using this for my Beretta PX4 Storm 9mm full sized pistol and it works great. The secure release lock works as advertised and allows for a quick draw once you are familiar with it. What I really like about this holster though is that its lightweight and solidly constructed. I would recommend this to anyone who owns the Storm.
483273,1,"Bought this watch a couple years ago and it was the best money I spent in years. It is by far the best watch I ever owned. Although bigger than most watches I ever had, its hardly noticable. Very light weight and durable. Besides the name that has worn off and some minor unnoticable scratches it still looks brandnew. Two years running and the bat is still going strong. Only downfall of this watch is the alarm is too soft and it only holds one time. I travel a lot and would like to have at least two time zones to keep. Great watch and will buy another again."
135301,0,"The suitability of this beanie cap depends upon your reason for buying one and your hat size. First I have a 7 1/8"" head size.

433989,1,"We just received this tent for an upcoming trip. I was at first a bit frustrated putting it together and then realized the key is to always push the tent poles into the sleeves, and out of the sleeves. Once you work out a technique for that the tent is great. Easy putting up and getting down. The windows could use a better method to fasten them shut. The tent does have nice features like a small clothes line and mesh pouches to keep items out of the sand. My kids love it and all in all it was a good buy."

481229,1,"I bought one of these 4"" large mirrors also. This mirror gives me the best rear view possible, plus i like the flat non-convex surface of the mirror. I feel safer using this mirror. I will buy more of them. I use a thin piece of plastic or rubber tire liner (like Tuffy Liner) under the clamp to increase the friction plus i replaced the nut which came with the mirror with a nylon insert lock nut (i think maybe 8mm size) available at any hardware store, because this nut does not come loose but you can still tighten or loosen it with a combination wrench. Yeah, this mirror is actually the perfect size for getting a clear view of the road behind you. I wished it was easier to adjust, but it can be adjusted with some effort. This type of mirror needs to be modified and improved because it is such a good and safer to use mirror. --gg"
491915,0,"A friend once told me that being a tall is worse than being a petite because I can always shorten pants, but you cannot make extra fabric to lengthen hems that fall above one's ankles? Well I can recommend these leggings for those fabric challenged tall gals.I usually buy a small, even though I have a slightly stocky build--okay, let's face it my waist is about three-quarters-of-an-inch long. So not only would the standard sized legging in a medium be long at the ankle, but the top portion would fit me like those grandpa pants that seem to be swallowing the torso.The small in these fit me fine from waist to crotch, but there is plenty of fabric to spare in the leg length. So I would say that a medium would be perfect for a medium tall.I wish the fabric were thicker like the leggings I have found in the past. However, since it is hard to find any leggings at all these days, at ten bucks a pair, I will hang onto these leggings, and wear them into the ground until they are relegated to painting pants."

10181,1,"I'll echo some of the other things that have been written:Substantial watch, but not too big. Feels nice on the wrist.Chunky without being bulky or heavy.The date dial is just about useless. And the seconds stopwatch is seconds only, not 1/10th sec.It definitely only glows in the dark for a few minutes, no matter how long you ""prime"" it with light.The band is very nice and the finish of the SS on the whole watch is beautiful.The bezel only moves counterclockwise.So far, in the week that I've had it, the time has been spot on (to the second). I calibrated it to my system clock after I had had calibrated IT to the Navy atomic clock.I'd add that the big second hand is only a stopwatch hand. IOW, it remains at 12:00 unless you need a timer. I thought that was a little weird as I'm used to a moving second hand. Basically, you rely on the 3:00 dial for your moving seconds.I was happy with the watch at $126. I'd have been even happier at $110. Fit and finish on the watch is top-notch."

491480,0,"I have an expansive workout dvd library but love to try new ones for continued motivaiton; I ordered several of Kelly's fitness dvds and this was the first one to arrive...I look forward to seeing how the others compare and will update more accordingly.I will begin with the Postives:INSTRUCTOR: Kelly is, unlike many fitness instructors, COMPLETELY comfortable on camera and it shows. Even Jillian, from Biggest Loser, (as much as I love, love, love her workouts) has nervous laughter and gets ""tough"" and pushy then giggles...seemingly out of nerves in her earlier videos. Other instructors often fill every silence with something silly like ""Now You've Got It!"" (always amusing when I'm struggling to figure out what they are doing at the time) but Kelly retains a smile, great energy, and provides great comfortable real instruction almost as though she really is there in the room as your own personal trainer.STRENGTH TRAINING: The strength training segment is superb. She cues well here and keeps your heart rate up so you burn calories and build muscle. She even has new moves I hadn't seen before like using a hand weight for some typically kettleball moves. Its fast and fun and works. She is very clear on what weight a beginner, intermediate or advanced person should use before each move.VARIED FITNESS LEVELS: She is not only specific of what weight to use based upon your level, but she has someone demonstrating moves for beginners behind her. She also says you should follow that person if you have problems with your knees.CLARITY ON WHAT TO DO: During the strength training portion, you can follow along easily and get a good caloric burn with varied and interesting routines.WARM UP: perfect amount of time and moves according to my heart rate monitor to get me warmed up and my heart ready to go.MUSIC: Great music. No odd instrumental elevator music...fitness dvds often dont want to pay a royalty on tunes so they have some odd stuff in the background. Some of this music actually had lyrics (imagine it! LOL) and some seemed to be a mix of familiar tunes instrumentally combined with others to mix it up...I think I heard parts of ""Mama Mia"" and maybe even the beginning of ""Stayin Alive"" mixed into a rhythmic instrumental beat that went well with the moves.ok...now onto the NEGATIVES:CARDIO PORTION: As another reviewer noted, here is where you are likely to get a bit lost and possibly frustrated. As I said, I have a big fitness library and I use them 6 days a week so I'm no beginner on aerobic moves. However, although she may ""cue"" the viewer, she moves so fast from one thing to the next that you are likely to often get lost unless you do this one several days a week to ""learn it""...in which case it would be fine. For example, she'll shout out ""floor squats!"" and if you have to think for a second what the heck that is, you'll miss the move by the time she's done with it...or she'll say ""squat turn!"" but not which way to turn so while you pause to think, she's done and onto something else as you try to catch up. Not only that, but the choreography isn't basic. You'll be combining several moves at a time and sometimes the moves are even done while you face the opposite direction of the tv if you follow what she is doing and her body position so...I wasn't much of a fan of the stumbling cardio section. But then I am no pro at coordination so base this on how quickly you personally pick up moves or how often you might do the video each week as you might pick up the routine. I prefer to switch out my workout dvds so I may set the cardio portion of this aside as I wound up standing and pausing a bit which lacked the cardio I needed...CUEING: It was there, but meant little since she'd simply call out the name of the move you were gonna do next but not what leg, and she'd move from move to move too fast for you to catch some of them well. Not good enough on the cardio portion to easily follow along, but her cueing on the strength training portion worked great.EDITING: If you just choose an individual segment, the editing is really good, but it was pretty odd when you chose a combo program. It would stop and start at a bizarre point. For example, for both combo workouts I tried the beginning of it started with a warm up that said ""Okay, next we are going to do a...."" and each cut ended while she was still moving and talking. I hadn't ever seen that before...she'd be up in the air and it was like someone hit ""pause"" then you'd go onto the next move. But once you realize your tape isn't broken, you get used to it.INSTRUCTION TO HELP WITH SQUATS AND OTHER KNEE PROTECTION: Her instruction on how to do things right is really good throughout the video except when doing squats and lunges and they are done often. Any intermediate fitness person will know your knees should not go over your feet...it's basic instruction in all videos...but this one instruction was left out when she did them and it's so easy to mess up on that if you are a beginner. So I had to throw that bit of protection out there if this is bought by a fitness newbie, just to protect your knees!CONCLUSION: I think this instructor has what it takes to be phenomenal and train well with some tweaks. The tape was actually great in the way of her energy and the strength training...and, before I did the cardio portion I was ready to give it 5 stars and call her one of my new favorite trainers. I think anyone from beginner to advanced will love the strength training portion and if you do this video many times you'll get down the cardio moves well enough. However, I can't give it 5 stars because I wound up turning off the cardio portion and finishing my workout on my elliptical because I found myself standing and trying to figure out what was going on too many times rather than moving. So, if you plan to rotate your videos, like me, this one just can't measure up for those who aren't quick to memorize moves instantly.I'm not giving up on Kelly...I have high hopes for the other dvds I already ordered that she instructs. You'll burn calories in this one and you'll appreciate her energy and great strength training. It was worth the price to me for that. However, I will use other dvds for cardio."
194534,0,"I guess it was an ok purchase. The wife liked it and that was the main thing. I thought that the tools were hard to get out and put back. I think more thought could have gone into things. There are alot of tools in such a small package. I wish they would bring back the PST. I don't see this as being something that would work for everyday use but more of a last resort survival type tool. It is there when you can't find anything else. I would rather it be something you use first because you have it on hand instead of a last resort thing because it is a pain to get the tools out. Screw driver selection needs to be better. I would put only two flat blades a small like for eye glass screws (1/16 wide) and a regular flat head (.2 wide). The tool is too small for a big flat blade. I would also make the flat drivers longer. The way the body is designed it is hard to tell what is a tool and what is the frame of the tool. I really don't think the new generation of Leatherman tool designers actually use these things everyday like I use my old Leatherman PST that they don't make anymore. I think they have too many products that are of questionably designed instead of a few well thought out ones like they use to have. I gave an average rating because that is what it is, average."

I keep one of these in each of my various packs (3-day bag, Camelbak HAWG, Camelbak Ambush) as you never know when you might need a fire.

That is unfortunate, because the cover would have been nice to protect the foam while hiking. The pad is not particularly durable.

232913,0,I liked the watch. Some may think it's a little big but I didn't think it was too bad. My complaint is the wrist band. It isn't made very well and the band pops out of the holder. It got really annoying so I had to send it back. Went with a casio and am very happy.
139170,0,"The Velo-5 is just what I needed. Basic stuff like time, distance, odometer, and speed. Installing it is easy and quick. One problem is the magnet.

But that's no big deal. The font size is TERRIBLE!. For guys like me, over 59, use a magnifier or you'll get a headache.

7596,1,"This bike is a great deal for the money, which is why I gave it four stars. Shipping was very timely. The bike came packaged well in cardboard surrounds and plastic standoffs. There was no damage and the major assemblies were put together. But, like another reviewer said, they were just slapped on with no fine tuning (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars).I assembled all the basics, but I got to a point where I knew I needed help. I couldn't get the stem to sit right. Plus, I wanted to ensure the brakes and derailleurs were set right. I paid to have the rest put together and tuned up. If you are not a bike mechanic you'll probably need some help.I took my 11 y/o daughter out to test it and the bike rode very well. It is a good fit for her at 4'7"". It accelerated smoothly. She had trouble reaching and pulling the brakes. She's on the shorter side for her age, but only barely.My daughter is transitioning from a 'dept store' bike, so I think this is perfect for the stage she's in. We plan for her to do some sprint/mini-sprint triathlons with my wife and I. We had considered Fuji and Felt's 24 inch kid's road bikes, but just couldn't spend the $700 to $800 they are asking. Considering she'll only fit the bike for another year or two, it was the right price.It's on the heavy side, considering it's aluminum. I thought it would be lighter since it's a small bike. I haven't weighed it, but I'd guess it's about 25 pounds."

190756,0,"First, for those that care about logo sizes, one should be aware that the product shot doesn't match what you get. Instead of the back saying HUMAN PROPULSION LABORATORIES, it says ""NATHAN"" in large typeface followed on two lines by Human Propulsion Laboratories. While I thought the ""Human Propulsion Laboratories"" type on the product shot was a little over the top, it was interesting as a label. There's nothing interesting about the word ""NATHAN"" emblazoned along the back -- the brand means nothing to me and I'm not especially interested in being its cheerleader. Second, the insulated sheath makes the tube unwieldy. By its nature, it can't smoothly arc across the chest as suggested by the product shot. Wearing externally, I imagine the tube will be awkward."

Guess that you get what you pay for (sigh)."
27883,0,"Introduction:I ordered this item quite a while ago, from the manufacturer BE (both elephant) through Airsplat. At the time, it only had only cost me about $35 shipping and tax included, it surprises me that now this gun is running $80. That may be due to improved gearbox design or whatnot, though I still doubt the reliability of LPEG (low power electric guns) rifles. I've heard many negative reviews about Airsplat, but personally i have had no problems with them. They shipped my BE steyr on time. When it broke, they even sent me another one as a replacement (though it took a bit of effort, and much too many phone calls). Anyways, on to the gun.First Impressions/Rifle components:I don't know what you would expect out of your gun. If you're aspiring to be a hardcore airsofter, i would recommend you save a bit more money and go for a cheap Jing Gong or Echo 1 (they'll usually run you anywhere from $100 to $200). From my past experience with BE rifles, they are amazing - at first. I suspect that they're not built to last, though initial performance is excellent.The Steyr i received was in a standard cardboard box with styrofoam holding the gun within. The gun is entirely plastic, with a few moving parts. The plastic is the typical ABS plastic used on most lower-end airsoft guns. It will flex a bit if enough force/pressure is applied, but is generally pretty sturdy and should last you so long as you don't abuse the gun. The front vertical grip is a three-position grip: all the way down, at a 45 degree angle, and all the way up - though it's a bit flimsy and seems like it might break off if you apply too much pressure on it. The inner barrel is actually some type of metal, i've never checked, but the outer barrel is plastic. The charging handle is only there for aesthetic purposes but is fun to play with, though i've heard that letting it snap back into place may eventually break the handle clean off. The rail is entirely plastic as well, but should serve the purpose of mounting the fake plastic scope just fine. The safety is a small square-shaped pin located just above the grip of the gun. Pushed all the way to the left locks the trigger in place so that you wont be able to pull it (safety), and pushed all the way to the right induces fire mode. Semi-auto is engaged by pulling the trigger lightly to the halfway point. Full auto will engage if you pull the trigger all the way down. Sling mounts can be found at the back of the rifle on the left side, and at the front of the gun right next to the charging handle above the barrel. The magazine is durable ABS plastic and holds about thirty rounds, which you will empty rather quickly due to the gun's high rate of fire. Overall, the gun smells like plastic, and my inoperable gun continues to smell like it even now, what? 5 years after i first purchased it? My guess is that it'll smell like that forever, but that's not too big of a complaint.Internal Workings:Now onto the workings of the gun. I've taken it apart a few times to try and fix it, to no avail. This is partially due to my own inexperience in working in Airsoft gearboxes, and also the cheapness of the gearbox itself. Everything within is generously coated in lubricant, and all parts are plastic. The gun is actually relatively easy to maintain, as long as you know what you're doing in the gearbox. But gearbox aside, the gun can be taken apart into 3 different parts. The front barrel assembly can be removed from the rifle by pulling and locking the charging handle back, and pushing a small nub found at the front near the charging handle down. This will allow you to turn the barrel clockwise, and pull it straight out. The next part of the gun includes the charging handle and the rail. A square-shaped pin near the magazine well can be pushed out, and the second part will slide right out. The last part includes the trigger assembly, magazine well, and entire back end of the gun. The screws can be removed (mind you, there are a LOT of tiny screws, so should you want to try this, don't LOSE them) and reveal a lead weight inside the grip, a plastic trigger assembly, and the clear plastic gearbox.Performance:Now onto the performance of the gun. The gun shoots rather accurately with a high rate of fire. Though this might be compromised by its tendency to stop shooting if full auto is engaged for more than 10 seconds, or if you fire semi-auto continuously for more than 10 or so rounds. From a distance of 35 feet, i had groupings within a circle five inches across. From a distance of 50 feet, I was able to hit a target 1 ft by 1 ft consistently. From a distance of 75 feet, i was able to hit a torso-sized target consistently, and i never used the rifle in a scenario where i would need to shoot farther than 100 feet. I would say the rifle fires about 300 fps at the max, with an impressive rate of fire. Just remember that your gun is not broken if it suddenly stops firing, it just needs a few seconds (or in rare instances a minute or two) to ""cool down"". The gun uses a Ni-cad double stacked 700 mah 9.6v battery that fits snugly inside the butt of the rifle. Just remove the rubbery butt plate and stick the battery inside.Major Problems/Lifespan:Now, my least favorite aspect of the gun: its lifespan. The gun lasted me a few months (maybe 3 or 4 of occasional backyard plinking). Now i'm not an expert on Airsoft guns, nor do i go airsofting regularly. But using it sparingly, and i MEAN sparingly, it still broke after only a few months. I went through a lot of hassle to get another one, since i had at the time believed it was simply a gun defect. The second rifle i got, worked well - for a few months again. Though the gun performs well, i can only conclude that the short lifespan is due to low-quality parts or parts that just aren't up to par with other AEGs at higher price ranges that perform similarly.Pros and Cons:Pros:-Accurate up to at least 75 feet-High Rate of Fire-Metal internal barrel-Relatively low price compared to other electric guns that perform similarlyCons:-Flimsy, incorperated vertical grip-Completely ABS construction-Low capacity magazine - 30 rounds-Occasionally stops firing, needs ""cool down"" period-Will smell like plastic forever (5 years later and still smelling strong.. lol)-Gun has a Short lifespan (a few months of only sparing target practice)-Plastic gearboxConclusion:Overall, i'd say this is worth it for the price. Let's face it, you get what you pay for - and at this price range, you can't expect a gun that'll last your entire airsofting career. If you're willing to upgrade the internal parts (gearbox), i'd say this rifle will last you quite a while, and perform rather well at that. However, with the cost of buying new, metal gears and bushings, i'd say you might as well save the money and buy a rifle already equipped with metal internal gearboxes (such as an Echo 1, Jing Gong, or Classic Army smg) assuming you wish to buy a reliable rifle to get into airsofting without killing your wallet at the same time. Hope this review helped you gain some general knowledge of this gun or airsoft AEGs in general, and I hope it will guide you to making the final decision regarding your next airsoft gun."
435054,0,"I really want to like these boots, but I can't make up my mind. I purchased them for my 1 yr-old mixed breed after she was recovering from a paw injury that she incurred when she stepped on a piece of glass in the road. I was a little confused at the recommendation to get the boot liner socks with the boots. If the boots cause rubbing without the socks, why wouldn't a lining be sewn into the shoes? I didn't feel like paying more money for socks, so I went to a baby store and bought 6mo baby socks that were seamless and used those instead. With or without the socks, I had problems with keeping the boots on my very active puppy. I'm not sure how these would ever stay on on the trail. The fact that they are pricey led me to spend 20 minutes tracking them down after they flew off in the grass and woods. I think the difficulty in keeping them on is due to the low profile of the boot and I wonder if the kind that come up higher like a sock would stay on better. The velcro wrap just seems to be in the wrong position to strap around the up-turned part of the ankle behind the large pad. Once I tightened them up substantially, they stayed on better, but my dog seemed uncomfortable. Maybe they were cutting off her circulation at that point? The other problem is that my dog has dew claws on all four paws, and these boots are definitely the wrong height for dogs with dew claws. I will probably try to use vet wrap to tape her dew claws down to see if that helps. That said, the boots seem very durable, and I am a bit baffled by people who say they fell apart. The soles feel durable and, when they did stay on my pup, they allowed her to grip and turn reasonable well in wet grass, though she did wipe out about a quarter of the time. I am going to give them a few more chances, but I will probably return them if they don't stay on reliably. I bought two pairs, one small, one extra small, and use the larger ones on the front paws and the smaller on the back. My other dog has the same size feet, so if we ever get around to trying them on her (she has even more pronounced dew claws than the puppy, so I am worried about that), we will do the same thing. I was surprised at the sizing. My dogs are 50+ lbs, and they've never worn ""small"" anything. The folks at ruff wear said that they have a lifetime return policy, and that's good, because if I can't keep them on, I'm going to have to return them."

I tried working with the holster as a left hand model and had difficulty placing the snap on while on my hip. (To reholster and secure the weapon) I believe with practice and with the correct holster most people would develop a system for efficiently snapping the holster secure.I like the look and feel of the holster and the craftmanship.

242423,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."

The shift cables were soft; wrong shift housing, so any adjustment into low hear meant that high gear would not work and the other way around.I thought the bike was incomfortable.This would be a great bike for a pre-teen or teen just ride around the neighborhood on. If you are really into cycling the I do not recommend this bike. It would be uncomfortable for a long ride of 12 + miles."
32175,0,"i bought this bottle to replace the cheapo thermos brand bottle i bought at walmart for about $10. i paid almost $40 for the stanley bottle at a local hardware store, and i was very excited about the prospect of a well made, rugged vacuum bottle for my sailboat. well, it is rugged, i'll give it that. the handle is weird, though. it really isn't good for anything except getting in the way. who walks around carrying a vacuum bottle by a handle? nobody. the real problem is that it simply doesn't hold heat as well as the cheapo glass thermos bottle did (same size). it's better than nothing, but just. the big difference in heat retention between the plastic/glass thermos and the metal stanley is when temps drop down to the 50's. in these conditions the stanley is down right dismal. boiling water in the morning is barely warm by mid day. the cheapo glass lined bottle is still hot. unless you need a rugged vacuum bottle, save your money and get a cheapo glass lined bottle at walmart."

184292,1,actually i'm just a rockie but I can notice that the dartboard is excellent but my only problem is that the darts included is very very very very very cheap 4 out of 6 was broken so if you want to order this dartboard absolutely you have to buy darts with a high quality.
480143,0,"I have always purchased Russell teeshirts for my husband. However, these have drastically changed over the years. They were quite heavy and wore very well. The ones I recently purchased are no where near the quality of Russell T's I have purchased in the past. I can only assume they will not where as well. I gave them 3 stars because they are better then most of the colored teeshirts out there."

2103,0,"This is the 3rd 2-bike trunk-rack I've owned. My personal experiences aside, it's still very nice and very well made. My review involves a 2007 Camry Sedan. The construction is very solid. Leaps and bounds above the others I've owned. I like how the weight is distributed to the two-feet on the bumper. Most racks have the load smashing down on the top of your trunk. I didn't like the fact that this unit has side-straps. This is the first 2-Bike carrier I've owned that has side-straps. I found this annoying and just another step in the process. We need to be moving towards *less* straps. Another issue was that the distance between the two bikes cannot be adjusted. Even my old $40 Schwinn trunk rack allowed me to do that. I have two mountain bikes and they were all up in each others business on this rack. There was nothing I could do about it either because the spacing is fixed. It seems that these types of racks are geared towards the more-narrow road-bikes. Almost every video I see has road-bikes on them. Not two hulking mountain bikes. And here comes the deal breaker: the actual hooks. The hooks are very awkwardly designed and I had the most maddening time getting them to hook. The top ones were OK. The side ones took a lot of manipulating (Especially the driver-side for some reason). But the bottom ones...well that was it. They wouldn't slide under the trunk lid for anything. So I opened the trunk to hook them, and then the trunk wouldn't close. And I was smashing down pretty hard on the trunk, too. Too hard to be honest. I never got it to close. All the other racks I've had the hooks were no problem. They just slipped right into the cracks. So I've returned it, frustrated again. My conclusion is that I need to either get 2 road bikes, or just suck it up, get a trailer hitch, and get something like the Saris T-Rax."
481689,1,I purchased several of these knives for my groomsmen. Everyone that received one tells me how often they use it and how much they love it. I have been surprised at how sharp the blade has stayed considering what all I cut with it. The only thing that prevented me from choosing five stars is the sliding blade lock. It has loosened up slightly over time and it could possibly allow the blade to open when the blade release button is pushed.

314465,0,"I ordered a 00 for my 4 1/2 year old who is a little above average in size. Since there was no sizing chart on the Tiger Claw listing, I referred to other charts to ensure I ordered the correct size. I checked the martialarts.com website and it told me the correct size would be a 00, which is what I ordered. It turned out to be HUGE and the sizing chart on the package I rec'd was different. And this sizing chart on the package is different than what another reviewer here lists. The package I have says Tiger Claw right on it and the chart is as follows:HEIGHT WEIGHT SIZE3' 35 00004' 50 0004' 4"" 65 004' 6"" 80 04' 9"" 95 15' 2"" 115 25' 5"" 125 3I now have to order a 000 and hope for the best.

38774,1,"This style used to be the ""King"" of the Seiko Automatic Dive watches till the Orange Monster came along. It is a quality made old school ""classic"" diver's watch for a reasonable price.Case/CrownThe case is constructed from solid stainless steel and is hefty. It is a little less thick & heavy than the Orange Monster. The case back is decorated with Seiko's Dive emblem design. The screw-in crown is at the 4 o'clock position and is large and solid feeling & the ears on the case help protect the crown from any damage. The watch is rated to a depth of 200 meters or 660 feet.MovementThe Seiko 7S26 21 jewel Automatic movement is a tried & true rugged reliable movement that Seiko has made for many years. Accuracy may be off + or - 10 seconds per 24 hrs depending on less or more arm activity. You can not pull out the crown to stop the second hand to synchronize - (Non Hack).Dial/Hands/DateThis watch has a awesome orange dial that is plain and easy to read. Hour markers are smaller & more subdued than the Orange Monster. Minute and Hour hands are gold outlined, which some people don't like, black would have been my preferred choice. The second hand is black with a small round luminous indicator on non-pointer end. Seiko uses Lumibrite on all hands & markers, this watch is not as bright as the Orange Monster due to the smaller subdued markers. This watch has a Day/Date window that is very legible. The day can be set to either Arabic or English and the usual black text is for weekdays, blue for Saturday and red for Sunday. Day/Date changes do not occur instantly at midnight. It takes roughly 4 hours (11 pm - 3am) for the change to occur.BezelBezel action is precise, smooth and expensive feeling as you can feel & hear the clicks of the one-way ring. The bezel has small indents around the outside & is less thick with no big lugs, which I prefer, unlike the the Orange Monster, but you can still turn it easily with gloves on. The black with gold numbering & markings on the bezel are printed instead of engraved but sits below bezel lip just slightly which also helps a bit to protect the crystal.CrystalSeiko uses a material called Hardlex which is less scratch resistant than sapphire crystal but also less brittle.StrapThe watch came with Seiko's rubber dive strap which is a beefy heavy duty strap.The bottom line is, Seiko probably sells very few of the SKX011J1 model now since the Orange Monster hit the market, as it is a little cheaper in price and has bigger & brighter markings on the dial.But if you want a quality made, less heavy & thinner old school ""classic"" look Seiko Automatic Dive watch that will never need a battery plus is made in Japan, it is a heck of a watch that I highly recommend."

346545,1,"I never wear sunglasses but after some time I decided to buy a pair with a hint of style and coolness. I've had the glasses for over a week now and I have had no problems with it. At first the frame was a bit too tight and I was afraid it might break when I unfolded it, so I loosened the frame with a tiny screwdriver especially made for sunglasses. If you think you will have the same problem then please find a specially made screwdriver for the glasses. The quality of the product is amazing for the price. The glasses are very comfortable and could been worn all day. I don't regret buying it at all and if ever I will need to buy another pair of sunglasses, I will surely buy these again.Also if you have very long eyelashes like myself, your eyelashes will not touch the lenses every time you blink which adds to the comfort level because it can become an annoyance over time if your lashes did touch."

320158,1,"I bought a number of Intex products for a family vacation on a lake in Maine. I purchased the whale, shark and gator floats for the kids ages 1 1/2 to 15 as well as the river run floats for adults. This gator was the favorite of the kids - it is sturdy (easy on/off) and the little ones felt safe as it is not too tippy. My 9 year old nephew, 4 year old niece and 1.5 year old nephew all rode it together while supervised by adults (it's very strong). It even held up with some large adult males pouncing on it! The whale and shark were cute, but harder to get on/off. HIghly recommended."

61472,0,"This is a nice-looking bottle in a nice size (1 liter) and, very important, no BPA. What takes away from this bottle is the mouthpiece you drink through. You're supposed to bite it (to open it) and then suck the water through. When you're not biting, the mouthpiece is closed so that water doesn't leak out. However, the mouthpiece is simply too big to be comfortable. It is very awkward to drink from it. If this were improved, this would be a pretty near perfect bottle."

166711,1,"I bought both the ALPS and the Byer of Maine Allagash AL Cot. In my opinion the Byer of Maine cot is better. First of all, the ALPS canvas was not square. One side was a good 1.5 inches long than the other.Cot Similarities - both are similar in dimensions and comfort, the legs are nearly identical, and the legs fit into the rails the same way (you put one end of the leg in one rail and bend the leg until it fits into the other rail.The Byer of Maine gets my vote in two areas: quality and easier to assemble. The ALPS rails are in three parts, which you fit together and then feed into channels on either side of the cot. It's a tight squeeze. It's not overly difficult, but the BoM cot already has the rails attached to the cot. You simply unfold them and insert the legs.That's my $.02. Hope it helps."
169530,0,"There seems to be some quality control issues with coleman coolers as I've found the lid sealing is quite different based on the one you get even in the same model. Some literally flop around without even latching at all. My own has some movement but does stay closed.I ordered this one for just keeping groceries cold on long 2 to 10 hour road trips, power outages, and when defrosting a freezer. After receiving it, I was disappointed in how loose the lid closes. When I checked local stores, I found that most were the same or worse that mine but there are tight ones if you really look. In comparison, I also ordered my husband the larger 120 qt model from another online seller and it also arrived with an even looser lid which we were able to exchange in store for a tighter sealed one.I do find this cooler is better than the average ones that don't list a cold number of days rating. However, it really depends on how tight your lid seals. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the good ones that closes. I did decide to keep it but it definitely makes me consider buying this type of product locally in the future to be able to test opening and closing the lid before purchase.Bottomline, I do feel it was worth upgrading from my old coleman but be prepared you might need to exchange it."

366327,1,"After reading the reviews here, we opted for the Copper Canyon 1312. Always a fan of smaller tents, I had to acquiesce to the needs of a growing family (5, including a 16-month old). In short, this tent is fantastic. Agreed that it has a thinner floor than would be ideal, but if you have a modicum of respect for your purchase and don't let wild animals run loose in it with no tarp underneath, you should be fine. We just used it for the first time on a 6-day trip to a rustic campground on Lake Michigan. Lying on our air mattress and looking up at the sky through the vents / rainfly, catching a glimpse of the room divider separating my wife and I from our sleeping kids, I felt like the sultan of a nomadic tribe crossing the Sahara Desert. Roominess is aplenty, but not overdone. I went with others' recommendations and purchased some crazy strong tent stakes to use, as I knew we'd be facing rocky soil, and those were a definite must-have. We had one night of heavy rain and only suffered minor wetness due to admitted user error. This is not an Arctic expedition tent, folks, but it is a wonderful all-around family tent. All in all, it was a great trip, made even better with this purchase."

Assembly was a breeze.This was a gift for a Mets fan. Even though it is a youth product, we hang out clothes on it. It works fine. It's sturdy and has not tipped over even under the weight of several layers of adult clothing.The only complaint I have for the manufacturer is that the package arrived with 3 stickers on 3 different sides of the box that showed the product. This was ordered as a gift, so when it arrived, the recipient knew what was in the box immediately."

276151,0,"We purchased this for our 3-year-old as an outlet for his energy and he loves it. The bounce is less than a spring trampoline, but that's not a bad thing for something children are using in the house. As for quality, it's obviously not a top-of-the line product but you get what you pay for. The materials could be stronger. I weigh 180 lbs and I think if I used it frequently I would probably wear it out within a couple months. Also one of the elastic bands on the piece that covers the frame snapped when I put it on. We're going to contact Bravo to see if they'll send a replacement. Assembly could be a bit of a challenge if you're not handy but it's totally doable without hurting yourself if you're careful. The instructions call for 3 adults but I put one side of the frame under an immovable object and that worked just fine."

138404,0,"I found this saw useful in some circumstances however also a bit frustrating. The first limb I cut down was about 4 inches in diameter, not too high up and relatively easy utill I cut about 3/4 of the way through the branch the saw jammed and I couldnt get it out. I was however able to throw another rope over the end of the branch and snap it off at the cut and recover the saw. The next branch was higher up and there was same loose bark around the branch (Austalian gum tree) Firtly I had a lot of difficulty getting the chain to flip over the correct way and when it finally did I had a lot of troble tryig to saw. the rope supplied had too much stretch in it (would recommend replacing with a better quality rope) and then the swy just jammed and took quite a bit to get it free. The next throw of the weight bag to get the rope over the branch failed as the rope and bag whip lashed around the branch and became stuck around a small fork... the rope and bag are still stuck up the tree. I would still buy this saw but I'd replace the rope, only useful for some branches, look at other ways of getting the rope over the branch...possibly use some heavy fishing line and a sinker first time to pull the rope over. And it is hard work sawing!! .... but if you have a challenging tree you can't simply chainsaw down and dont want to climb, is useful."
269921,1,"These socks are wonderful! I was afraid that they wouldn't be bright enough, but these socks are very much neon. They are plenty long and comfortable. However, I try to use them sparingly. When the box arrived, I put them on around the house to see how they looked on me, and after only five minutes of wearing them, the bottom of the foot was slightly worn. Overall a great sock."
298014,1,Great timing with dely.Kids weren't as excited about this product as I was.That's ok. Neat product. Everyone loved it once they gave it a chance.
291283,1,"I like this kanteen. I ordered the stainless steel one and I think it looks really smart. I use it at the office and feel cool at meetings. I got the 18 oz one so it's not too big, not too small.To address some of the complaints other have on this product. My bottle did small like metal very strongly for the first few days that I used it. People said it makes the water taste bad. I think that the water actually tastes okay (the reason that you don't taste it using a straw). I think that the smell is confusing the taste buds. In any case, it's not pleasant but it did go away. As far as the lid trapping water. They seem to have made a new kind of lid that is totally open inside. It's made of bpa free plastic instead of the stainless steel one that people felt was trapping water.My only complaint about the classic design is that when I get toward the bottom of the liquid I seem to be spilling it a lot when I'm drinking unless I'm standing still and concentrating on being careful. I'm not sure if the wide necked one would be easier. I was drinking from plastic bottles before this and they obviously don't spill as easily. I've adjusted and gotten better at drinking from it.So, overall, I like it. I like the look and I like not having to buy all those plastic bottles."

85822,0,"Pants are fine. A little snugger than what I'm use to, but then I normally avoid anything with spandex. However, based on the sizing information I could find, it looked like they should have been 5"" to large in the hips. Fit was definitely skin tight."
273077,1,Bought this for my husband for X-mas. He likes this type tee for the winter and I could not find any at any of the local department stores. He loved it!! I have washed it at least 6 times since I purchased it and no fading of color. Highly recommend.
73840,1,"The main reason I purchased the standard diamond kit was to allow me to create a known bevel angle on the knives I use these stones for. Which so far have been a few 2 to 3 inch folders, and a Becker BK-2. I have a Kershaw Blur showing up today that probably won't need much attention in the sharpening department for a while, but It will work fine on that blade too. The standard kit will not get you that 'shaving sharp' blade, but it will get you 90% of the way there which may be good enough for a lot of people. I finish up the job by hand, with a DMT extra fine diamond stone. However, you could certainly pick up the extra fine diamond stone for the Lansky and have it all in one box. I may do that but it's somewhat unlikely at this point. Not because I don't like the kit, but I'm trying to develop some skill without extra equipment.What I like the most about this kit is that during your course to fine sharpening steps, when you are removing the most material, you don't have to worry about the angle you are creating being too shallow or too steep, it's pretty much impossible to do anything incorrectly. I have noticed that the guide rods that attach to the stones, can become loose a bit, requiring you to hand tighten the thumb screws once in a while, and also the clamp that you attach to the knife doesnt appear to hold very tightly, and I don't want to crank down on the little red, plastic capped screw on that clamp to try and make it hold tighter. It appears that tightening it too much would certainly put stress fractures in that plastic, so I have to watch out for that. Overall, the system does a great job which is the important thing. As other reviewers have noted, if your blade is longer than 3 inches or so, you will most likely have to reposition the knife in the clamp, otherwise the stones will just not reach the edge.As I continue to hone my own skills, I'll probably use this kit less frequently. For people like me that have always just 'winged it' when it comes to knife sharpening, this kit is a great help. 4 stars."
422173,0,I don't believe this product is strong enough to handle a heavy bag (80 lbs or more) given that it's supposed to be mounted on only one roof joist rather than across several joists. I use it for suspending a headache bag and it works fine for that purpose.
316877,0,"This is another well made Arc'teryx product. The fleece makes a great layer for warmth when used with a shell and is well designed. The fit seems a bit large for a medium (I'm 6' and 165lb and it fits a bit loosely), but that's typically true of Arc'teryx.I guess I didn't give it 4 (or 5) stars because it is extremely simple for the amount of money it costs. I have several Arc'teryx products (backpacks and jackets) and have always found the high price has been worth the quality of product I get, but I found the trade-off to be lacking here. There seems to be nothing that makes this fleece standout from other fleeces in the higher-end outdoor clothing market, yet it is priced significantly higher. I've seen fleeces made from other companies such as Patagonia that would undoubtedly do the same job functionally, but look and fit much nicer - all for at or below the price of this fleece. I guess for this price, I expect a bit more."

105168,1,Really love this. It works well on my bike. I mounted it below and snug up against the reflector so it has to be removed with a tool. If not you can just easily unhook and take it with you or clip on clothing. Mounting directly below an obstacle reduces theft and I don't have to think about it.
64638,0,"This is my son's second scooter-same model as before. It is moderatly durable if it is going to be well taken care of. My son leaves it out in the yard all year long. It seems it has a life span of a year. The reason I did not get the upgraded model was that children grow so quick. And also one month my son will love his skateboard, the next a scooter and then the bike, so there is no need to spend a lot of money if it is used for a short period of time. He likes it just fine."
99114,0,This is a good work out pants. It is durable and fits okay (the waist is a little large). I have worked out in them quite a bit but noticed you do not sweat in them that much. I would recommend something else if you want to use it as sweat shorts.
447292,0,"The vest is comfortable overall. I don't know about the other sizes but the 4XL-7XL has two unshown, lower straps that apparently go between the legs. The straps were not uncomfortable, even while sitting, but I returned the vest because of the indignity of wearing it while sailing (and the possibility of an unexpected painful shift). The side adjustment straps are well-designed for a wide range of bodies. I thought about keeping it and cutting off the lower straps but decided to return it."
98429,0,I purchased this for wearing at the Y during swim exercise class. This is a light exercise class so there is no underwater or lap swim. I have long hair and it is difficult to stretch this and pull over the hair. It works best when I have stretched the cap over a bowl prior to use. It keeps my hair dry if I have properly fitted cap on but it seems to stay tighter towards the forehead and as a result gives a slight headache during usage. I continue to look for the perfect cap.

464358,1,"I have to say that I am fairly impressed so far...*Time keeping is accurate enough for me (I'm not too late, or worse, too early for any meetings)*build quality is super for a ~$120 watch and I would consider to be good for a ~$300 watch... my biggest complaint is that the band is a bit sharp on the edges.. but this would not be a big enough concern to prevent me from buying another.*reliability... well I've only had the piece since Christmas(2weeks)... and so far its great*the Japanese movement has a nice tone to it and is very quiet... the second hand does not sweep but is faster than 1 movement/sec*as a side note if you have small wrists... the face may be big enough to span the entire top of your wrist...and is generally a heavy piece.*I don't have any experience with the water tightness of this watch other than being able to keep water splashes from hand washing out..."
194376,1,"Like a previous reviewer, I love to play ultimate a lot. This disc flies extremely well, and has a great feel with the right balance between the center and rim. The only disadvantage this has that glow-in-the-dark discs do not is the batteries/LED in the center, but if you play well, you probably don't catch it ""sandwich"" style anyway. They did a good job of balancing the weight toward the rim as well. Like someone else said, depth perception at night is tricky, but that is not due to this disc in particular. Also, the lighting around the rim isn't quite bright enough to help you tell when it is breaking and which way it is breaking if you are playing with street lamps in the distance. All in all, this disc is pretty amazing. I wouldn't use it in an actual ultimate game because it is 185g instead of 175g, and has the battery compartment in the middle (small), but for practice at night, it can't be beat."
334416,0,"We gave these knives to a Scout group and everyone loved their size and coloring. However, we had quite a few finger slices because the blade is so small and thin it's difficult to tell which blade is the sharp edge at times. Also they are a little tougher to open and close because everything is so thin."
248789,1,"We take a couple of these stoves into the boundary waters every year and never have a problem. We accidentally left one out in a rain storm all day and the burner filled with water. Turned it over to drain out the majority of the water and fired it up. Only about half of the burner was lit at first, but it quickly burned off the rest of the water and was back to its old self. I love this stove!BTW, I could have bought it cheaper locally if I'd know where to find it. Shop around."
281114,2,I also was a owner of the original big wheel and bought two of these for my grandchildren. They are of poor quality--nothing like the original and they do not hold up for little rough boys. I had two sons and they did everything possible to the original and it just kept rolling---NOT so with this one

68317,0,A good durable ball but if you're serious you should spend more for the game ball. This one stings a little.
303658,1,"No kidding this is extreme! My husband and I work out together with the P90X and we love it! It took a bit of time to fully finish some of the workouts, but I realize that is okay. It is a ""working up to"" process. Great product!!"

198393,2,"This ""gun"" is horrible if you want to go up against anyone other than your friends who have been in the sport just as long as you have-not very long. This gun will REFUSE TO SHOOT WHEN POINTED DOWN, will jam often, and is very weak, not to mention the small range. However, as far as starting weapons go, this is not bad, as it is cheap, Comes with nigh-unbreakable ""goggles,"" although they are a bit smaller, and the battery charges VERY fast, whatever the box-which is mostly in chinese or broken english-says. Not to mention the target works, and the broken english the instructions are written in is actually good for a laugh."
383763,2,The pants did not last more than a week. I even bought two pairs thinking that I would have them for a few months. The material is cheap and rips easily. DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!
344860,1,"This arrived quickly from Amazon and the directions were good. I'm a 41-year old mom and I put this together by myself. I needed our wheelbarrow to prop it up. It took me about 90 minutes. I tried to put sand in the base, but the hole is so small that it was taking forever so I finally filled it up with water (I'll remember to dump it in the winter before it freezes).This is for my 5 year-old. He is autistic; he had a Little Tykes basket and would just make 10-20 baskets in a row, it was amazing, but it was already on the highest setting. So I upgraded him to this one. After it was up, he took 4 shots and they all missed; I was a little worried that it was too tall even at the lowest setting. But then he just stood there, starring at the backboard for the longest time - and then his fifth shot went in. Now he loves it!! And it will grow with him! I love that!I highly recommend!"

319381,1,"I've had one of these for going on 7 years.Very early on, internal ricocheting shattered the white plastic spacers on the rods inside that support and catch the targets. Once that happened the target stopped working since the targets would no longer reliably catch on their hooks. I got some plain old drinking straws from McDonalds, cut them to the desired length, slit them down the side and just replaced the old broken pieces of plastic with the straws wrapped around the rods. The straw's elastic property prevents them from shattering and keeps them in place. The hard plastic used for the spacers is a design flaw, IMO, but is easily remedied.It's been more than 5 years since I did that modification. I've left this thing out in the back yard for months on end. It got a little rusty in places but it still functions perfectly.It's an excellent training tool, I use a 3' by 2' plywood backstop and plink in my basement to my heart's content. It has really helped my consistency, even at 7 feet these small targets present a challenge.I plan to buy a second one along with a second Crosman 3576 (a surprisingly accurate little shooter) so I can race with my friends or not have to hand the pistol back and forth while shooting with my wife.I hope I get as lucky with my second Gamo Rocker as I did with my first."
42431,0,As advertised. I have heard there are wear and tear issues with this vest but haven't used it enough to know for sure. Would be nice if is was a little more secure when walking at a fast clip. The straps have a tendency to loosen.
470671,0,"I got this exercise bike around christmas it was fairly easy to assembly, didn't take a lot of time. I was mostconcerned with the amount of resistance. During the winter when I can't ride my bike outside this became my bestoption for a work out. However riding 15 to 20 miles on this bike a day(sounds like a lot) I received no work outat all I never even felt winded. I am not a stellar athlete either. Given the choice to do this again I wouldn't. The fact that you can not increase resistance is one of the worse drawbacks, along with the seat beingas hard as a rock."
307713,0,was hoping for something a little better like other mesh shirts as the material here is more like polyester or spandex.. but it does the job and fit well.
206218,0,"Purchased two of these for my wife and son's bikes. Bikes made a 2200 mile trip without a problem.As mentioned...The ""hook"" end is protected with a rubber coating but the opposite ""fork"" end is bare metal. Due to time constraints I ended up wrapping the ends with duct tape and the covering the slide pin with a nylon hose to protect from metal to metal contact. For a permanent fix I will dip the ""fork"" end into a liquid rubber compound made for tool handles but I should have too!!! This is my only complaint."

468557,1,"This is a nice little hand crank lantern. The light is bright for this mini lantern, of course it is not as bright as a full size one.

153793,2,This compression short did not fit good at all i will not be ordering anything from this company anymore
381362,0,"I've used Omron pedometers for a few years and I've been extremely happy with them. I purchased the HJ-720ITC in order to upload the data to the internet. What I especially liked about my Omron pedometers is the convenience of just slipping the pedometer into my front pants pocket and forgetting about it, even when working out. I don't get this convenience with the HJ-720ITC. When working out, leaving it in my pocket it skips a lot of steps. In order to capture all my steps, I must use the plastic belt clip which has worked so far, but I fear the risk of it flying off if my workout gets too um, energetic."
96781,0,This cooler is adequate for traveling not as heavy duty as some other brands but does cool fine.

176320,1,"I would like to confirm the previous reviewer's comment that the color on this suit (Navy Blue) faded very quickly. In addition I also found that the shape gets stretched and baggy fairly quickly, in spite of rinsing with fresh water after every chlorine exposure. In general, this doesn't seem up to Speedo's usual quality, but for the price ($17) it's a good deal."

73837,0,"This is the closest thing I have found anywhere recently for a threaded flexible pump hose for pumping bicycle tires. Although it will thread onto a valve stem it has a smaller than typical male thread for mating with a smaller pump,( I think it fits those old style long thin frame pumps) so it doesn't fit as is onto a ball pump. I made an adapter for it using an old inner tube valve stem but I had to file down the hoses threads so the adaptor isn't removable, its just good for ball pumps or insertion to compression hoses if I prefer to use a threaded connection."

299666,2,"Wow, did I make a mistake purchasing this item. First, it is not easy to assemble by ANY means (I am talking about the balance bar), and I cannot even attach it to the trampoline properly so that is remotely useful. Please do not waste your money by shelling out extra for the balance bar.The tramp itself is just okay. My feet and ankles pronate badly on the mat. This is not a comfortable bounce at all. I bounced slightly on it for about 10 seconds, and I strained or pulled a calf muscle and something in the top of my foot.I am very far under the weight limit of 300 lbs, but it feels like it's going to give out under me.Maybe it'll work for others, but not for me. I am so disappointed."
44329,1,"Being a New England cyclist, there are time when the weather just does not cooperate, and one needs to get on the bike and ride. That time is called Winter here, and unfortunately, it consumes a good part of the year. Ice, snow, wind, ice and more snow all mixed with salt = big time mess for a nice road bike, too much maintenance for this rider to want to deal with when time is scarce.Enter this product, and place it into the limelight. This little gem is pretty amazing. I was looking for an indoor trainer that would hold my own bike (nothing worse than not having one's own saddle), not require a total removal of the wheel/s, would be quiet (so I could enjoy a movie or music or just silence), and have a full range of levels from easy cycling to heavy duty hill-climb mode. The CycleOps does the job, and it does it very nicely. It is quiet: a huge factor. By switching gears, there is indeed a full range of stress that can be accommodated here. I often feel that in just 30 minutes, I have successfully burned as many calories as I would normally in about an hour of true road cycling... and I wonder if that is actually true. On the road, there are coast moments, and moments of traffic avoidance and red lights. With an indoor trainer, this is not true. One simply continues cycling at any pace one desires. All in all, I highly recommend this trainer. It does what it is supposed to do with minimal hassle and minimal setup time."
490833,0,"This product is fine. I ordered it with the Topeak Trunk Bag. They arrived together on time. The trunk bag was missing a shoulder strap. When I reported the missing shoulder strap they sent me a replacement rain cover. Even though I very specifically confirmed they were sending me a strap. ""you're just sending a strap, right? I don't want to bother with any exchanges."" ""Yes""But they shipped the cover and want the original back. When I spoke to a rep she was kind enough to credit me for the missing strap and promised to eliminate the return request on the cover. But I'm getting reminders now that the cover needs to be returned or they'll charge my credit card. It's a hassle you hope to avoid."
439973,1,"I have been using Berkley Trilene big game fishing line for over 15 years. It has always performed exceptionally well. I like its enduring strength and flexibility. I use mainly 40lbs test line in exclusively salt water for Striped Bass and Blue fish and have never felt that I should have been using some other line. The only negative about this line is that it retains more memory then I would like. But that being said allot of other lines that I've tried in the past had similar problems without offering the other positive characteristics of this line. So until something better comes along, I will continue to use Berkley Trilene Big Game line."

31609,0,"Good quality, but there are a few issues with the bag.It is difficult to unzip when the bag is mounted on the bike as the saddle blocks your hand when the zip reaches the top.Lightly touches the back of the thigh when cycling and it is kinda irritating.Does not hold my wallet after putting in a spare tube.If you are very concerned with the angle of your tail light then please be reminded that the product does not allow you to adjust the angle of your tail light. That angle may change when the shape of the bag changes due to the things that are put inside."
244210,0,"Material is excellent. Since my last purchase of this product, the length has shortened up considerably. Now hard to keep tucked into my jeans. Don't buy if your over 6'. Now made in El Salvador, previously made in Mexico (I think, not sure)."

354809,0,"I bought a pair of these for qiqong and kung-fu practice a few months ago and I have to say they are working out better than I expected. They are durable, flexible and light. My only complaint is that it feels like the sides of my feet are hanging over the sides of the sole. This makes it a little harder to balance sometimes. However a larger shoe size is too big. Other than that I'd say this is a decent shoe, especailly for the price you pay."

417168,1,"this is a good wallet, I bought it to replace a canvas wallet and it is good replacment,only problem maybe that the card pockets are too large, my cards fall out easily, but is not a major issue.I like the outside zipper pocket for spare key storage.plent of room for everything i carry and is not bulky."
334830,1,"I used this Rust-oleum topside paint on my kitchen window sash channels, sashes and exterior door. The idea was to find a paint that would not cause the sashes and door to stick. I was very pleased with the outcome. I sprayed the paint on the sashes and door and hand painted the jamb and sash channels. The paint flowed out nicely, eliminating the brush strokes. The sashes slide freely without binding allowing them to ride smoothly on their old sash weights. The door does not stick to the jamb or weather stripping. Great product Rust-Oleum!"

288048,0,"I have tried several different ropes over the past two years. I bought this one along with a couple of other cable ropes from another company. The Super Jump rope is very durable and well constructed. For simple jumping, with doubles, it is a very good rope--and probably warrants at least 4 or 5 stars. It also provides a nice workout for the arms. However, if you like to do crossovers and and the like, the Super Jump rope is probably not the best rope to get. It's not very flexible or supple, so it's easier to get caught in the rope on crossovers and similar tricks. Since I like to vary my rope jumping routine, this is a rather major issue. As a result, I don't use the rope very much.As I said, though, for straight jumping, this is a very good product."
157892,2,When the tire tube arrived (1) would not inflat so I purchased another from a nearby store to save time.
485343,0,"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to Bowflex Selectech dumbbells, and long story short I just ordered a set of Selectech and will be trying to sell these or else give them away.They are weights, yes, and they are adjustable. But I found them to be a bit clunky and not very ergonomically appealing. Also, the change between weights unless you're doing 10 lb increments is time consuming. There are two 2.5 lb weights in the handle, so you have to remove the center handle and remove one or both of them depending on if you want to adjust 2.5 or 5 lbs. Plus then you have one or both of the 2.5 lb weights to deal with until you put them back in the handle. A bit of a pain in regular use, but especially for me as I use them for P90X and changing as quickly as possible is beneficial.They're not bad, I just think there are better alternatives out there."
452186,0,"I love this brand of shorts which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, I misunderstood the description and when I click on different links to the item, it changes from Juniors to Girls. I understood Juniors to mean teenage girl age. As a 20 year old girl, I can easily wear a M/L in these shorts for Juniors/adults. When I got my package, I received a Youth Large instead. I had to give the shorts to someone else who could wear them because I needed them on a time crunch. This is a good brand, just a little confusing on the description."
449470,2,"The first one we ordered arrived and we put it in the camper without opening it. BIG MISTAKE. The kids went to use it on vacation and there was a giant hole in the boat and the oars were missing. WHAT a disappointment.

484072,0,"I got the 9', 4-piece, 5-weight. It's a beautiful, lightweight rod, one that I can cast all day. The cork is high quality and the reel seats' hardware and finish are top notch. I did overload it and am actually casting a Type IV 6-weight SA Wet Cel sink line in local lakes. The rod handles this line effortlessly, as though they were designed for one another. 60-70' casts are no problem. Rod came with a nice tube and sock, a great added touch. My only complaint, and this is a big one, is that it does not have a hook keeper! Are you kidding me? All the effort they put into making this beautiful rod and including a case, and they can't mount a hook keeper. In fact, I've never seen a fly rod without one! Very disappointing!"
188201,1,"Comes in a box, scratch off the paint (which ensures that accidental strikes in the box are impossible), works like a charm. One thing to be aware of, though, when making your purchase; Do not expect this work in the manner that you strike it once and you have a blazing fire. This is not the case, it takes a few well applied strikes to get some light kindle to light and you can build a fire from there. This is not true because it doesn't work correctly but simply because it's just not that easy to start a fire. The product works exactly the way it should."

One of the two balls, however, turned out to be leaking air off, which we discovered only at the beach and chose to keep playing (needed a second ball), rather than go through the hoops of returning to Amazon after the vacation. I was disappointed that even Mikasa apparently has such quality control problems, requiring us to inflate the ball every couple of days or so.Other than that - it's a great ball to enjoy for some decent volleyball."

376754,0,"I bought 3 of these over time for different locations. I wish I could give 3.5 stars. It is the only panel I could find at this electrical rating and price category. I'll probably buy another if I need one, but I wish there were an alternative.The solar panel itself works well. It maintains the charge on a 12V security system type battery as long as the solar gain is adequate. If you have a week of rain, you might need another source, depending on your latitude. It needs to be carefully mounted on a sturdy surface or it will bend and crack. The wiring is flimsy and the connection system minimal (provide your own spade connectors...). The packaging for shipment was also poor."
421736,0,"I received product in awesome time,purchased for grandaughter,my family will be gone on vacation for x-mas, so her x-mas was yesterday 12/18.She loves the gift,however the scooter has some damage to it in the side a small dent & scratched paint job at the dent. I dont think it should effect how it works but dont know yet because the battery requires 18 hrs of charging. I will know by 4:30 pm today 12/19 because she will be on it the second she gets off school. I eagerly await the ph call, so I will update then. Hope its as fun as it looks because her eagerness to ride & the smiles when she opened it were worth millions to me. I also hope some kind of compensation can be made because it will break her heart if it does""nt work or she has to return it."
410262,1,"This attachment runs smoothly, works well, appears to be stronger than any person using it will ever be. I suspect the only way to make a better one would be to use ball bearings or perhaps needle bearings in the revolving part, which would make it more expensive. The handle is probably less than one inch thick, so if you like a thicker grip, you may want to look at others, or consider using a piece of pipe insulation around the handle, which helps build grip as well."
168120,0,"If you need a noseguard for basketball, you have two choices. This mask for $30 or one of the ones like they wear in the NBA for several hundred. I've tried both. The expensive one cracked when I got an elbow in the face. So I tried this mask. In order for them to construct this as a one size fits all, it is built up with padding where it hits your cheeks. This makes the central part over the bridge of your nose protrude, and the vision is really horrible. It is a joke. You could get injured worse trying to play a sport where you can't see. But if you take a high speed drill, you can carve it to your liking in order to improve the vision. It is made of polycarbonate,which is pretty indestructible, so you can carve that bridge part pretty narrow in order to open up the field of vision. Now this may compromise protection of the eye area, if this an issue. But if you need this simply to protect your nose, this is a good workaround as to the vision issue. I would give it only 1 star because they could easily construct this with better vision without you having to take a drill to it. But with no other reasonably priced product of its kind is available, I'll give it 3."

86012,0,"These gloves are huge! By that I mean the punching surface is huge. I have rather small hands and they fit fine from inside, but they are definitely well-cusioned. I'm not sure what the little cushioned point between the thumb and the rest of the hand is for; maybe it's just to round the shape out a little or protect your hand from knife-edge strikes.I use these gloves exclusively on a 60lb vinyl punching bag (so far). I have made lots of hit lower on the bag where the sand inside is packed and it didn't hurt much at all. You definitely can tell it's packed sand, though, so maybe it's best not to throw your hardest punches on that part of a sand bag. I've only been using the gloves for over a month so I wouldn't expect wear to be an issue. So far it isn't. Amazon has a good price on these."
406114,1,"Definitely buy one size larger than you normally wear if you want a little room and two sizes larger if you want them to be very roomy. My son wears a XL to XXL depending upon the brand and I ended up buying the XXXL.Otherwise, they appear to be of good quality and the best value I found. Very comfy for lounging around the house and nice to have two deep pockets for your cell phone and misc."
270203,0,"I've owned two of these Sleek watches. The first was the light blue. After a few months the blue around the face looked chipped and worn. The watchband started to crack in multiple places and looked really dirty. Finally the Indiglo light died, so I couldn't tell the time in the dark. But I love the multiple alarms, the smaller face that fits better on female wrists and that all the buttons were located in places that made sense. I used the chronograph when doing sprints and the lap timer when doing, well, laps. So when the light blue watch lost the Indiglo light, I bought another one. This time in black so the watch band wouldn't show the dirt. Again the paint around the face of the watch started to come off within the first few months. By the third month the buttons were sticking and became hard to push. But due the functionality, I just dealt with the buttons. I replaced the battery at about the year mark and within 3 months, the watch band was severely cracked. But again, I kept wearing it. Finally it just broke. I wish I could replace just the watchband, but due to the other issues, I'm going to look for another brand. Timex was so close on this one, just needed a better watchband and a better paint job."
490629,1,"I just got the rack today and it seems to be attached. I put it on my 2010 GT avalanche problem is there are no seat stay bosses (little screws that you can't figure what they are for, they are located under the seat on the frame). So I had to think a little bit. The rack mounted to frame fairly easily, no problems with the disc breaks.Since my bike has a lack of seat stay bosses I had to use the seat post clamp. I tried to use both arms that came with the rack but i almost lost the bolt, my eye, and the use of my bike seat.Unfortunately the clamp screw is a little short and the arms are like spacer in the clamp. I had to loosen the clamp to lock it down. This left the bolt barely threaded and caused it to leave my bike with some good force. So I just used one arm to secure the rack to the frame. It feels pretty secure and not flimsy at all.Ok let's wrap this up. Fits the 2010 GT avalanche with no real problems mounting it over the disc breaks. Minor hiccup securing the arms to the frame, but nothing too difficult.Yes I would highly recommend this rack."
46548,2,"This product works great as long as you go under 45mph in your car. Ideal for city life. It's easy to put on and take off which beats dissembling your bike to put it in the trunk. It was fine when I had it for the first couple of months driving around the city to go the trails.However, I drove 5 hours each way to go on a biking trip, mostly doing about 70+ mph. The bike ended up scratching my bumper pretty bad as it was flying around. Furthermore, the rubber wheels of the rack that sit on the trunk ended up burning a hole through my paint as it shifted back and forth from the force of the bike flying back and forth. I even stopped 4 times to tighten everything down as much as possible!!! I'm glad I have an older car so this doesn't matter so much to me, but I can't imagine the surprise people are getting on their new to 1-5 year old vehicles!! People were staring, and no one followed within 300ft of my car.The top of my trunk has two holes straight down to the metal and the bumper has skid marks/scratches all over it. Don't be cheap and get yourself a trailer hitch installed. Then purchase the bike racks that fit into those that keep the bike away from your car and the product off the paint!!!"
33179,0,Nice case for the money but the plastic is somewhat thin and a little cheesy but it was bargain priced so ...ho hum
271026,0,"Nice, but far thinner material than an older identical style number. I was hoping for the heavier version but these will do for light duty. Minimal shrinkage in sleeves as well as overall length and width, but they WILL shrink."
346725,0,this product is ok but i wonder if its even real ray bans.. i have read someone else's review that said that one of the handles was loose and man were they right!! i think the reason its soo cheap is because amazon buys the defective models from ray ban. i wouldnt buy this product again. for 40 more bucks go buy it from the ray ban website. i think it would be more worth it than having a defective product.in conclusion dont buy this product if you wanna walk away satisfied.
302071,1,Both me and my wife use the vest with no problems. Big enough to slip over winter jackets.
384526,2,I needed a jock strap and purchased Bike because that's the brand we would use in high school. Right out of the box there was string hanging off it. I thought this was not a big issue but as time ticks away the thing is unraveling. I haven't even washed it yet. I think it wouldn't even make a good grease rag because there's hardly enough material. I would rate this if there were negative stars because one isn't low enough.
430909,0,Not all that comfortable as they feel a bit heavy. They're a bit plain but they do adhere to the product description.
460023,1,"I think it is a fantastic product if you can convince yourself that spending 40 bucks on a bottle cage is not insane. Provides very secure fit for my 24oz Polar insulated bottle, and at the same time easy in/out while riding. Got a matte black finish to match my frame and it looks great."
295695,0,Great sword hangers but they are somewhat poorly made. They are kinda flimsy and need longer screws. I'd still buy them but just keep in mind you might need some longer screws.
444328,1,I purchased two of these as part of my emergency survival gear. It goes together fairly easy and is a decent enough little stove. I plan to use my chafing fuel cans and they fit perfectly inside the little stove. Neat little product!
162824,2,"We have 5 of these stoves amoung the group I camp with. 3 of them were purchased in early 2009. The other two in early 2010. The base of these older stoves had a base to canister connection that was one piece with machined threads and an external gasket as well as an internal gasket. The older version also came with a hard shell velcro case. The hard case is the reason I first went with this product over similar products. We never had any problem with the older design. The newer design comes in a nylon ""stuff sack"" kind of case and the base connection has been changed to a two piece design. The new base is smaller with only the internal gasket and a brass threaded sleeve that has been pressed into the body of the stove. Both of the newer stoves failed in the field. I sent them back and they were promptly replaced with two identical stoves. These two new stoves also failed. I believe the problem is that it has to be screwed on ""just right"" to the canister. If it is too loose, no gas. If it is too tight, the sleeve slips. If the sleeve slips, it is inoperable. The internal gasket appears to move too much, making it hard to find this sweet spot. It is not so much of a problem to find the sweet spot if you are indoors or camping in ideal situations, but when it is below freezing and the gas from the canister doesn't want to flow correctly anyway, the window for the sweet spot is hard to find. The instructions clearly say not to overtighten, but the with the older one piece design, there was no issue with the sleeve slipping, because there was no sleeve. The newer version is perhaps a little lighter - not enough to notice, but the older design has never failed us and we are still using today. Meanwhile, the newer version has been sent back again, only to find out it is back ordered and will not be replaced for almost 4 months. I give the old design with the old velcro case 5 stars."

281889,0,"The mat serves the purpose and is OK...however, it had a dreadful chemical smell. I couldn't use it until I had soaked it in the bathtub in detergent and left it outside in the fresh air for 4 days. It still has a faint smell, but no where near as bad. I have experienced this with other products made in China, but can't recall reading similar complaints."
146287,0,"This package took forever to get delivered. It didn't reach me on the estimated time of arrival; it was at least a week later. It comes with one screw, so I was a little worried about how one screw in the wall can hold up my heavy bike. It works if you have it securely fastened to a stud in the wall. However, there is absolutely no way this can hold two bikes, unless you have two thin road bicycles or children's bicycles. I have a mountain bike and a cruiser. It'll hold one or the other."
79788,0,"I am a daily commuter and carry an Ortlieb pannier on my Topeak.(10-15lbs) I have around 3000 miles on the the rack and although I LOVE the MTX attachment system for the Topeak bag, the aluminum sides of my Topeak rack have worn away in numerous places from the pannier resting against them. The pannier is attached VERY securely with the Ortlieb system and does not bounce or sway. But there is obviously some abrasion from the hard plastic back of the pannier against the aluminum rack. There are places that have 1/32 inch scoops out of the aluminum rack. I have carried panniers on a number of racks with far LESS secure mountings and have never seen this. At some point the rack is just going to split and fall apart. Hopefully not while I am riding. Given the rack is only a year and a half old this is unfortunate and why I rated it only 3 stars.I also find it alarming that this rack is sold as a ""versatile bike cargo rack for long distance touring."" I am only carrying 20 lbs at the most. I can't imagine this rack could hold up to panniers loaded with 55 lbs over thousands of miles!If you do mount panniers and ride a lot I would check to see where there is ANY contact between the pannier mount and the frame of the rack and wrap those areas with heavy tape or padding of some sort and then reapply as needed. This would probably prevent the problem. It would be nice if Topeak addressed this problem and supplied some pads to prevent this. Some thin rubber strips/collars that could be taped or zip tied to the frame struts would be a fix.I found this premature wear disappointing for a rack designed for pannier use. I also expect my rack that is in no way abused, to last a lot longer than 18 months.I do LOVE using the MTX bag when NOT commuting and the attachment system is really well constructed, and easy to use. Now Topeak has to make a rack that is as good as the MTX system AND stands up to regular real life use."

35967,2,I bought this hat cause it really has a cool logo and I loved the fact you just don't see it everyday. Anyways soon after I recieved the hat I began to wear it. It seems thicker than most hats and I really enjoyed wearing it. unfortunately on the 3rd day I had it I has pulling the brim on the cap and the back part where you size it snapped off like a twig. I didn't even really tug hard. Anways it ruined the cap and looking at it i see it was somewhat cheaply made.

482303,1,"I got myCitizen Men's Eco-Drive Perpetual Calendar Two-Tone Watch #BL5184-56Lin July, 2005, and I have been very pleased with it. I wear it every day, and I have NEVER had to worry about the battery (the Eco-Drive works!). By the way, I live in Wisconsin, and I work in an office, so it's not like this watch is in the sun a whole lot. The light that it does get is enough, and it has never been an issue.I wanted (needed?!?) a calendar on my watch that took care of itself. I never wante to worry at the end of a month, if the calendar needs adjusting. With this watch, once it's set, it will work for your life time.I don't use the ""stop watch"" too often, but that works well. I don't think I've ever used the alarm (cell phone alarms are easier to program, in my opinion). I have used the time-zone feature - and that is nice if you travel between two zones with any frequency. When you do have to change the time for those trips that cross several time-zones, it can be a bit tricky to do right. On two occasions, I did that wrong, and changed the date too - and then I needed the manual (or the Internet has great instructions too!) for how to change the date back.The clasp and metal band and its links have all worked fine - with no issues, and again, this is used daily, and it's now about 4 years old. A great purchase!"

497081,0,"Bought the ball based on price...as most of us do. Price was great...$10-15 below local stores. Shipping was fast as usual & free.Unfortunately, this ball had a MUCH firmer feel than the exact same ball I bought in a local store a few months ago. MUCH harder feel than basketballs I felt yesterday in the store, as well. Yes, they are all the same model, so I am comparing apples-to-apples here. The ball is still of good quality and not damaged in any way. It is just a warm-up / shoot around ball now. Everyone I hoop with is used to the usual soft feel of the TF-1000 ball. Between us we have 4 other TF-1000's and they are all comparable in feel - this one is just...off.From now on, with items like this, where feel is so important. I will pay the extra $10-15 at the local store so that I know exactly what I am getting.Oh well..."

70543,1,"5.11 Tactical Pants are awesome. There are pockets galore for everything you would possibly need to carry. The two cargo pockets on each thigh are roomy enough, yet not baggy when empty. There is even a smaller pocket over the left front pocket that is perfect for carrying your cell phone or an extra magazine. The ""slash"" hip pockets make it easy to store and retrieve items. There is even a small brass d-ring to attach your keys. I own these in khaki, desert sand and green. Fantastic for hiking, outdoors, competitive shooting or just a great casual look."

It does keep her warm and she likes that but she said that it made her itch a little bit in the beginning, but that is her getting used to the different type of material. Overall good product and I'll purchase again as I also have purchased the men's coldgear for myself. Oh and as far as delivery it was very fast. Love that part about amazon and the vendors connected to the site."
425933,1,"This worked great for me, but with these provisos.1. You have to look up the Tyler Twist on Google to figure out which exercise to do. It's a specific exercise for tennis elbow that isolates and stretches the tight, tense muscle at the root of the pain. This exercise doesn't come with this product.2. The stretching helps right away, but tendons take a while to heal, so don't expect an overnight cure. Figure on at least three weeks.3. This blue is okay for fit men, but probably the green is the starting point for most people."
326142,1,We purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the Keys. The DVD gave her a good overview of how to use the mask/snorkel. The mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out. This was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for.
407823,0,It worked fine as far as heating the water. One day it was almost too hot to use. I did experience one significant design problem. The on/off control is done by twisting the end of the hose/spicket (a screw operation). This is fine until you have soap on your hands and the smooth ends of the screw operation are too slippery to turn. I had to grip each end with a wash cloth to get it to turn. It should have been designed with a grip mechanism on each side of the screw mechanism.
14616,1,"It is what it is. The quality is great. My dog looks like a cubs fan now. He's not really a fan of wearing it, he just kind of cowers around the house when he has it on. But hey! He's in a dogs cubs jersey!! It's also awkward and difficult to take off. It's easy to put on because his paws slide into the front arms but his paws dont exactly bend out of it as easily. If you have a medium sized dog get a large or x-large - take measurements. I have what I consider a medium/small dog (55lb) and the large fit perfect, if not a bit snug. Anyway, pretty cool jersey, although I feel a bit pathetic for buying my dog clothes."

342523,1,"This belt is everything they say it is. I wish it were 1 1/2 inches instead of 1 3/4 inches. The Galco holsters are cut for 1 3/4 inch belts but the DeSantis holsters mostly are set up for 1 1/2 inch belts. I used a small rat-tail file to extend the opening on my DeSantis, now it fits fine.One work of caution. As other posters have indicated on belts manufactured by Bianchi ... these seem to run small. It really isn't that they are &#34;shorter&#34; than another belt of the same size, it's just where Bianchi decides to start putting the holes. I compared this Size 34 Bianchi Gun Belt with several other belts that I own that are also Size 34 and find that Bianchi starts the holes at least one inch further back on the belt. This means that if you are used to plugging the belt tongue into the second hole on a &#34;regular&#34; belt, You'll be left plugging into the first hole on the Bianchi. If you're using this belt for an Inside Waistband Holster, it's going to bee too short.I returned the Size 34 with no problems (Thank you Amazon) and purchased the Size 36 and it fits and functions exactly as I was hoping."
134496,0,"I play a lot of Cricket and thought this might be a nice improvement over a chalk or dry erase board that would continually require clean-up.So far it's functioning okay but has some issues:1. The Cricket variants use colored LED's to show you the status of play and they go from Green (/) to Orange (\) to Red (O). The problem is that the orange and red are often extremely similar except at specific angles. At some angles they both appear red.2. The touchpad surface works well so far but for some unknown reason the makers used blue for the color of the numbers on the black backgrounds. They're extremely hard to read as a result.3. The unit will sometimes lock-up on a fresh start just sitting there. You have to power it down and leave it dead for 5 or more seconds and then power back up when this happens.4. One feature that's mentioned is the ability to play the computer. This seemed like a great feature for me as I'm the main player in the house and want to practice. It works for that but there really isn't any AI. It turns out the unit just runs through pre-canned lists of shots. I first realized something was up when it became apparent that the computer player will NEVER hit a 20 first and almost always hits a 19 first followed closely by bulls. I then started jotting down its opening 3 shots to see that they do in fact repeat.5. The unit claims to support eight players. However, it doesn't rotate scoring for those that aren't up. Thus, in a five-player game when the first four players are up you can't tell what the score of the fifth player is and when he's up you can't see the scores of the first four. I just assumed the scores would rotate back and forth.6. Computer players are slow. It seems they're paced to give the impression of real players and it's frustrating to stand around waiting for a phantom to throw three darts in ""real time"". There's no way to tell it to play faster. Furthermore the prompts are confusing. The computer will finish and the unit will declare, ""Next Player"". So you get set and just get ready to throw and then the unit blurts out, several seconds after the last comment, ""Player One"", just in time to distract you. Why it needs this delay is a total mystery. You can stop it by hitting the Next Player button which apparently is what the first prompt is suggesting but why? The computer is done. There's nothing else to be done. Just move to the next player immediately.7. The unit has a LIMITED ability to correct mistakes. Generally it can go back one set of darts and that's it. If you hit Next Player, and realize you have a problem, you're done. Start over.Overall I still like the unit but for the price I expect more. I want this type of convenience over a chalk or dry erase board. If I must I'd pay more for it though there isn't much out there to compete with this."

264187,0,"This item is pretty nice. The only problem we had with it is the logo on top is not smooth. It's very strange. Like when cheap particle board gets wet and expands, there is this rough, raised circle around the logo but under the paint. We never bothered to contact the manufacturer to see if we got a bad one.Overall, it's not a bad product. The rest of it is in great shape and it is easy to assemble and comes well packaged. But if any form of blemish on something that should be smooth offends you, you may want to call the manufacturer first to see if they are all like that."

136105,0,"Why did my brother want my opinion? I'm a fitness professional from the clinical side of things (working with people coming out of heart surgury or with osteoperosis, etc), but I've also worked with the military and private gyms. I've seen plenty of fitness fads. Insanity has some interesting differences, and is a good fad to add to the fitness library.First, people are self-paced and perform an exercise within a certain time limit. After a series of exercises is completed, the series is repeated. I rather like that, especially as someone that leads exercises as it helps to simplify things. Not so fit? Well, you'll have fewer reps. More fit? You might over do it, and that perhaps might be the danger so if you're leading this kind of exercise, then make sure to stress form and such to keep THOSE people safe, too. This aspect of the timing is NOT, however, stressed in the program. In fact, typically (and especially in the more advanced workouts), everyone must ""keep up"". I think an opportunity was missed here, but Insanity it targetting ""hard core"" people, or people that want to be, or even people that think they are.Second, having seen plenty of DVD sets for exercises, I think the progression of these is quite good. You get a lot of disks and a lot of workouts, so that might make a difference. Still, I do NOT see a complete beginner who has lived as a couch potato reaching the most advanced disks any time soon. The workout doesn't promice that, and I think if you take each level at the 60 days, then you're well on your way to doing the body good. Basically, this workout has something for all levels. This is actually one of the best reasons to own the set, though I raise my eyebrows at the price tag, especially since most people that get this set will NOT be able to perform more than half of it.Still, I do have some problems with Insanity.First, terminology: I see plyometric being bandied about a lot when talking about this workout. While some of the more advanced routines DO have some more strictly plyometric-type movements, plyometrics is not something that CAN really be applied to a AEROBIC workout. That's not their purpose. What's actually happening here is ballistics, which I find fascinating as I STILL run into people that complain about jumping jacks (and in the same conversation clamour for THIS workout).Second is just my usual nitpicking about exercise fad videos, really. Our host has lots of energy, but suffers what most new exercise leaders do in their first DVDs--their encouraging remarks and pseudo-science talks are really quite horrid (I'd say that nearly every fitness release has this). It's nothing horribly painful, but as a fitness professional I catch it, and wince, and discover wonder again as no one LATCHES onto the misinformation and sues the fitness person. But the disclaimer saves all, I suppose.As I say, however, Insanity is a decent set to own. I give it 3 stars, relegating it to a nice change of pace to a video exercise library. It DOES include a lot of high impact (literally, now) ballistic exercises, which I like (I find myself laughing when people seem to attribute the INVENTION of these exercises to our host, but he has put them together in a slick package). I might have given this 4 stars, but the talk is a real killer for me and I've SEEN all of this before--I blame the day job.Ultimately, I'd buy this for my professional library to meet popular demand, but not my personal one. Get this if you train people that are ALREADY very fit because it does have nice variety. Watch this and take notes if you are a fitness professional becuase there ARE some nifty things going on here, namely the arrangement of the exercise routines and the use of time. Everyone else? I recommend borrowing your friend's first.My exact words to my brother: ""It's ok. I like the timing."" He and his fiance were devistated, but I applauded the purchase as apart of their over-all desire to get/stay in shape. I wouldn't be doing my job if I turned people OFF of exercise!"
136100,0,"You get a better workout with 90X.Insanity is good, it is heavy duty jumping and there is too much time between exercises. P90X is harder and keeps my interest. The hardcopy material were visually pleasing, but lacked content. I will keep Insanity, but it wasn't worth the $$$. Also I had multiple problems with DVDs being bad: one wouldn't load, others had video issue halfway through the DVD. Be sure to check your copies and use all disks immediately if you purchase this product.Update: P90X is much better. I returned this product."
428074,0,"The Momentus weighted clubsMomentus 7-Iron Weighted Golf Swing Trainerand Momentus Power Hitter Driver (Momentus Power Hitter Driver Swing Trainer are training aids to help with strength, flexibility and training the golf to have a proper release in the golf swing.THE SLEEVEThe Tempotimer is a rubber lined, solid core sleeve with a nylon exterior. This weight device fits easily onto any club in the bag allowing the golf club to be a weighted club.The advantages of the weighted clubs include increased flexibility, improved golf strength, improved swing tempo and the proper release of the golf club. A weighted club is a great tool to warm up (versus swinging two wedges).The small size allows for portability (fits easily into a pocket of your golf bag).VERSATILITYWith regards to warming up, this tool really shines. The heavy weight improves the ability to stretch. Practice swings really work with any club in the bag. Given the weight, you improve your tempo and your ability to release (curing the over the top flaw of many golfers). Even a weighted putter helps the golfer swing on plane.PRACTICALITYSwinging this training aid on a club to hit a ball is possible with wedges, short irons and the putter.However, I would not recommend this club to a beginner or novice to hit longer clubs such as fairway woods, hybrids, long irons and the driver - with regard to HITTING THE BALL.Without proper fundamentals, this can lead to injury since it is even heavier than the heaviest Momentus Power Hitter. The Power Hitter is a weight balanced heavy club. This training aid makes an unbalanced golf club - increasing the predisposition to back and shoulder injury; especially with overuse.I also caution the use of this club with graphite shafts. There is a noticeable flex as the club is being swung at full speed. It is like swinging a more flexible shafted club (i.e. Senior flex for a regular flex shaft).VERDICTOverall, this is a solid training aid but it has some limitations.This is better for an intermediate/advanced golfer with a higher than average fitness level without back or shoulder issues.Please note that there is a cheaper alternative by SKLZ called the SKLZ Rick Smith Power Sleeve, costing only $30 retail.SKLZ Rick Smith Power Sleeve - Portable Club Weighting SystemSKLZ Power SleevePower Sleeve - Portable Club Weighting System"

I've hit a bag a few times with them and they haven't ripped (as other reviews I've seen for them claim). I'll throw them in the wash one of these days and hopefully that'll help break 'em in."

105061,1,"This is a great watch for anyone that does more than just sit in an office all day (i.e. you work outside, go hiking, fishing, camping, etc.). Its very durable, waterproof, and has a nice secondary time feature (just in case you travel between two time zones a lot, which I do). At first it feels a little bulky and rubs against the skin in an odd way, but once you break the watch in and the strap begins to conform to your arm, its very comfortable. This watch is definitely a good buy for the money, as I suspect it'll last me nearly as long as my last shark watch (10+ years)."

I assembled this by myself, but it's probably better if you have two ppl.It's pretty good considering:1. you can adjust the bottom parts so it won't wobble about on the ground.2. the feet pads are pretty big for anyone.3. you can assemble it by yourself (even though two ppl would be a lot better).However, it's not great considering:1. it makes a lotta noise. Sounds like someone's using a blender.2. the screws aren't that strong; after using it 5x or so the handle starts to turn along w/your body when your shifting back and forth (though you can still tighten the screws back up, but still.. it's a hassle)."

482580,1,"Great everyday pocket knife, slim and small yet large enough for most jobs. High quality and has a VERY sharp edge. Be sure to use the safety lock if you wear somewhat tight pants as the pressure can open the blade and ruin your pants. The safety lock is made of plastic and if you close the blade on it several times, it will break. I did this and called Kershaw, they send me several replacement locks and screws for free, no questions asked. I asked the customer service rep why it was made of plastic and not metal like the rest of the knife, and what he said made a lot of sense. He said &#34;Well it&#8217;s less expensive to replace a plastic safety then the whole blade since the lock is located near the tip of the blade, a metal lock could break off the tip if accidently closed too hard on it.&#34; Excellent knife, excellent customer service, couldn&#8217;t be happier with it."
120258,0,"For max brightness & effect the light must be tilted up slightly to point at drivers eyes, NOT run parallel to the ground. The LEDs are VERY directional.You must have adequate height available on your seat post or it will not fit, or even if you get it to fit it will not be removeable.The light is 41mm (1.61"")tall, 87.3mm (3.43"")wide.The quick release portion of the bracket slides on to the rear of the light AT THE BOTTOM. This means you must lift the ENTIRE light above the bracket to slide it down & lock it into the quick release bracket.So do the math. The bracket is 30.5mm (1.2"") tall- the light is 41mm high, but only 38.75mm (1.53"") of it needs to be lifted above the bracket before sliding it down into the locked position. This means you need ABOUT 68.75mm or 2.7 inches of seat post available. That may not seem like much, but it won't fit at least three of my bikes. Fits one mountain bike & one cruiser OK.But remember, the LEDs are directional, so the light should be tilted up towards approaching drivers eyes. OOPS, you can't tilt the light back very much or it will hit the seat post when you try to remove it. It slides up to remove & don't forget, we need 38.75mm or 1.53"" minimum clearance above the bracket.So, you may need to buy or fabricate an extension out from your seatpost & mount the cateye bracket to that. You may need to call cateye & buy a rack mount & attatch it with that. If you dont have a rack, you could still mount the rack adapter where an existing rear reflector is located.Would I buy another one?. Only if I checked & measured the bike for fit first.By the way, one reviewer noted that in flashing, sequential (side to side) & random modes, you don't have sychronization between the bottom & top rows. This is true, but if you put one row in blink, & the other in sequential or random, it's pretty damn bright.I think next time I would try a cateye Rapid 3 (TL-LD630), a TL-LD610-R, which I believe is discontinued, or a Planet Bike Superflash or Superflash Turbo."

It is so much better than sitting out in the sun - it's cooler and despite the fact that some bugs do get in, it makes sitting out in the evening much better - a couple of citronella candles help a lot."

Also, if someone wanted to they could walk away with bike and rack because no parts of the rack are secured to keep it from being removed from the car. A elastic cord is needed to secure the front tire of the bike during transport."

146842,1,"I've had this light for about a month now. Prior to the 5000x I was using a Cateye EL-500 LED light. The 5000x is much brighter, but is more of a yellowish color as opposed to the Cateye's white light. For seeing the road, this is superior to the Cateye. It provides not only a wider beam, but is overall much brighter. I use both at the same time, and on country roads with no streetlights and occasional potholes, I feel confident up to about 20 mph. It really helps to aim this light further down the road, while using the dimmer EL-500 to light the road directly in front of the front tire. While this combo pales in comparison to HID lights, it is much less expensive. I use rechargable batteries since this light does eat batteries fairly quickly. In comparison, the EL-500 LED light seems to go forever on one set of batteries.For any inexpensive light, the 5000x is good enough to see with, though I recommend supplementing it with another light for seeing the road, though it would be enough on its own at lower speeds. If you don't have rechargable batteries, I think you'd be better off with one of the LED lights, but the 5000x along with 4 AA rechargables and a charger is still less expensive than the Cateye EL-500 or the newer EL-530. And it's much brighter too."

90822,2,"This leg drop set up is not molle... and the leg straps are singles... basically this thing flaps all over the place and you are stuck with it in the configuration it comes in... You cannot swap anything out (like the 3 ammo pouches I don't need on the left hand drop) and you cannot change this up to make a left handed rig unless you want a leg mounted cross-draw (fairly useless). I was going to return this and amazon said don't bother and just refunded my money.If you are serious about getting a leg drop set up and already have a tac-vest, then order a higher quality unit. If you're looking for a low-cost, solid set-up... then get the UTG rig that comes as a molle vest with 2 molle leg drops and then you can arrange the pouches, etc however you like them.My 2 cents."

Certainly its not rock solid but for $20 it's a good deal. The top is a bit flexible, but it easily holds a camp stove, lantern and food items. I wouldn't sit on it or drop a fifty pound ice chest onto the middle of it, but you shouldn't anyway. The fiberboard underside is protected by the aluminum tabletop skin and should hold up reasonably well unless you leave it outside in the rain all season. If you need a small, lightweight and portable table for occasional outdoor use, this will do this trick."

After two years, both units develop an air leak through the battery compartment which cannot be fixed with any patches. Unfortunately, air mattresses are becoming nearly disposable, but I expected more from the Eddie Bauer brand.For my next purchase, I will get one with an external pump. There is no point in each mattress having its own pump. It means more batteries to worry about and more seals that can fail."
290452,0,Good and bad for this jacket. First the price is to much. I paid $74.00 but it should have been lower because there is nothing to this jacket. It feels like your wearing a piece of plastic lined with netting.

The sleeves are long enough for me as I am 5'8 and it is hard to find a jacket with sleeves long enough.

476623,1,Fairly comfortable. Used it for camping with my two dughters for five days. Plenty of room for all of us and a yellow lab on the bed. Did have to reinflate slightly every day or two but that only took a second. Had a tendancy to slide a little on the floor of the tent also. Good value for the money. Easy to pack away. Held up well to our abuse. I'm sure we'll get years of use from this product. I am very happy with the purchase.

They fit her a little shorter than pictured on the manaquin (why don't they use real people in these pictures?), and so they didn't meet the requirements.Material is just your basic, thin stuff. But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her.

After a great deal of research, this Eureka Backcountry 1 came highly rated and has proved to live up to the reviews, in my opinion. Most notably to me, is the fact that the tent is nearly 8 feet in length, I'm 5'9&#34; and the added length allows me to comfortably place my backpack and belongings at my feet inside the tent, eliminating the need for the vestibule that is missing on this tent. I would rather have my provisions inside and completely dry. It does sweat a little under certain conditions, but experimenting with better ventilation may curb this.It sets up quickly, is sturdy and unnecessary to stake the tent down in some cases as it stretches out securely. Very happy with this tent and highly recommended !"

262456,1,"Purchased this mat to use when camping with my son's Cub Scout Pack. It worked out wonderfully at keeping me insulated from the cold ground (the Autumn temperature reached 39 degrees) and cushioned just enough to make it a comfortable night's sleep. One of my two complaints is that the smooth surface enabled my sleeping bag to slide off and so found myself a couple of times thru the night rolling and twisting in my sleeping bag to get back onto the pad. Otherwise they work just as described...self inflating, easy to pack back up. I do think they should include a stuff sack with the pad instead of being forced to purchase seperately. And the idea of storing them flat and inflated for long periods--well lets just say the person who came up with that obviously doesn't live with cats."

491287,0,"The bottles look good, and the price was good, but unlike the one stainless steel water bottle I have, the bottle makes the water coming out taste metallic. I suspect the metal threads for the cap rather than the interior of the bottle. I would recommend that customers select some other bottle."
16787,0,Its built sturdy. But one problem it was not drilled in one spot where it needed to be connected. We drilled it our selves rather then sending back.
398270,1,"I read most of the reviews and was surprised at how many negitive ones these skates had. Nevertheless, I could not pass up the price or the free shipping so I bought two pair, one for my 8 year old daughter and one for her best friend. No complaints here! Both skates look great, work great, and are still going strong. The girls skate both outside and in the rink and wouldn't DREAM of using their old skates ever again. These ones are definitely a step up from what they were using before. They really love the wide wheels, how smooth, and how much faster these skates are compared to their old ones. Mind you, their old skates weren't too bad, (they were the standard kiddie ones with the brightly colored wheels) but they certainly weren't these skates. If I had to nit-pick, I dont know if I would purchase these skates for a brand new skater only because I dont know if the ""pleather"" could take the beating their old ones took and still look ok to ""hand-me-down"" but these skates are durable all the same. This was a great purchase I didn't have to break the bank for so I'm happy about that."
253290,0,"This purchase was the first major screw up that has happened to me while using Amazon.com.I ordered heat shrink tubing but I received an inflatable boat fender instead.I know it sounds crazy but it is true.The UPS man had to use a dolly to bring it to my door. All the time I am looking at this giant box I am saying, ""What in the world could this be?""It was so crazy and funny that there was no way that I was going to send it back.Since I do not have a boat or a friend with a boat I have no practical use for the item except as a conversation piece.So a week or two after my experience I see someone making the news where they received an assault rifle after ordering a computer monitor.Anyway... It was worth a laugh or twelve."

424159,0,"This chip set is good quality for its price, but my major gripe is that I was sent 150 yellow chips instead of 150 white chips, as pictured. The product details do not specify what colors are sent, so Chipsandgames will send you whatever colors they have in stock (this is what they said when I called them). In order to exchange the chips, you have to pay for shipping yourself. If you order the chips from [...] directly, you can specify the color and quantity of chips you want. Also, there is a defect on the bottom side of the case."
428145,1,"With the restriction on bags/backpack at recent airshows this is a very good option. Will carry extra batteries and cards for the digital and still leave room for multiple rolls of 35mm film. Lower front pockets (inside and outside) will fit a 200-300mm range zoom with ease. Rear pocket will hold 350,400mm fixed length lens or a rolled poncho. Good weight distribution, much better then carrying a heavy bag on one shoulder."

50597,1,"We recieved this bike in the mail last week, my husband put it together...and our son has been obsessed with it ever since. He is not quite 2 and 1/2. He pedals with ease, rings the bell, manuvers this bike like he has been doing it forever!It is made really well, and I love it becuase it has a lower center of gravity unlike some other tricycles and does not tip easily at all. The real inner tube tires grip the road and do not slip like plastic wheels have a tendency to do. Great buy, you won't regret it! Schwinn makes an excellent product here."
286468,0,"Fit is not great for me. Uncomfortable around the ears and nose and, if ever scratched, are worthless. I would like a harder surface and better smoothing of the main contact points."
338203,1,"Having been diagnosed with beginning osteoporosis, I wanted to manage it without drugs if possible and that would include more weight bearing exercise. Having this pedometer has made me recognize that I don't come nearly as close to the recommended 10,000 steps per day as I thought. It provides the incentive to step it off. The Omron pedometer seems to be quite accurate and is not too bulky under clothing. The safety strap is definitely a plus."

I must have tiny wrists but I had to remove most of the links and it was still either too loose or too tight. There was no comfortable middle ground. If they used smaller links, then maybe it would have fit better but...."
123569,1,"I purchased this item for my daughter who is horse crazy. We use them for hanging not just her bridles but her lead ropes, her jackets, her belts, her necklaces, anything that can be hung or that she may not want to hang in the closet. We love them are are thinking of getting more to hang in the garage and closets. They've strong, sturdy and they look nice. I love the colors! They are definitely worth the price. I couldn't have found a better bargain."
191963,0,"This product is a good value and gets the job done. I don't know if anyone else experienced this problem, but mine came without all the necessary bungies. Enough I suppose, but not as many as indicated. As noted by other reviewers, the instructions make no sense and don't work; but if you just follow the image on the cover of the box, you should be able to figure it out. The kids are enjoying it."
344724,0,"This is a nice product, just be careful with the sizing. My son wears a size 12 jeans and weighs about 90 pounds, he needs a size medium pants. I had trouble finding the sizing chart and ordered the wrong size. Also, the belt isn't a ""true"" belt in that it doesn't go all the way around the pants so you can't buy a larger size and just tighten the waist."

152459,1,"Have used this device only once so far, and it seems to work very well. It's very easy to use and attach to the bike, and seems very solid structurally. It is an absolute must have if you have a bike with an other then standard top tube. And since so many mountain bikes these days do, it essentially becomes a must have if you have a mountain bike. As well, if your cables run along the bottom of your top tube, you avoid having them pushed up against your bike and scratching the frame, not to mention stretching and then not shifting right, which they would do if you hung it from the top tube. The red ends of the device are coated with a rubbery material so they don't scratch your bike. I use this device with the Yakima Swingdaddy Rack, and its a win-win combination. I would recommend both items to anyone."
187509,0,I bought this item so I could carry my daughter's school bag. It works well except for when I make sudden turns or stops. The springs that hold the item onto my bicycle have probably fallen off once a week for the past 4 weeks. Love the item but the flimsy springs leaves much to be desired.
351477,1,Super bright and easy to attach to my bike. I don't know what that other person was taking about...my set came with instructions for both lights. A+

486141,0,"I love this brand of shorts which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, I misunderstood the description and when I click on different links to the item, it changes from Juniors to Girls. I understood Juniors to mean teenage girl age. As a 20 year old girl, I can easily wear a M/L in these shorts for Juniors/adults. When I got my package, I received a Youth Large instead. I had to give the shorts to someone else who could wear them because I needed them on a time crunch. This is a good brand, just a little confusing on the description."
61964,0,"I purchased this bottle because of all of the good reviews, but it leaks more than my old Rubbermaid. It seems that water gets caught in the bite cover, and then leaks out when you least expect it. Bottle is OK otherwise, but the leaking is really annoying me. It happens more often after I fill it. It is, however, sleek looking and attractive, and overall serves it's purpose."
319399,0,"I bought a similar item for my friend. He liked it a lot. the only problem was that it a shade too small for him. but he is still using it al the same. For the price I got it for, I expected a good size but I cant complain. it is fair to buy."
471301,1,"I was very pleased with this device. It is sturdy, and looks like it should last forever, since it is constructed of solid plastic, with some metal parts. I was looking for a way to build up my wrists after an accident, and this was much better than other devices I tried. The device gives my wrists and forearms an excellent workout. The tension can be adjusted.My only complaint is it is a little to big for my arms. I find that I have to hold the frame of the device with my free hand otherwise it bites into my arm, but overall I am very happy with this device. It might not be comfortable for a child."
2228,2,"looks cool. Key word people ""looks"" cool, it isn't bullet proof, please don't think it is, or that pockets make you look the part."
157272,1,"I purchased the Schwinn No Pressure Bicycle Seat as a replacement for the stock seat that came with my Schwinn 3 Wheeled ""Meridian"" Bicycle because frankly, my backside is just a little to big for the little stock seat. Also, it not only feels better on my backside, it looks better than the stock seat."
130844,2,"The lower extension cinch bolt worked loose while riding, and the lower extension fell out and is lost forever.The extension ought to have had a stop to prevent it from sliding all the way out of the upper tube. Having to keep a kickstand tightened to prevent half of it falling else is absurd- I'd rather it just came long and they had me hacksaw it to length."
356312,0,Purchased in July 2009 (now Late October 2012) - With very little usage and being left outside almost constantly in North Carolina Mountains should we only get 3 1/2 years before the cords fray and break? This seems to be less than what I would have expected. I tried to get on it today - noticed frayed cords and wound up on the ground when I tried to get in anyway.
462395,0,"I was looking for a good, American-made pocket knife and bought the Case Sod Buster, Jr. It seems to be a solid knife, but I wish it had a lock-back mechanism. I thought most quality folding knives had it, and did not realize this one lacks that feature until I got it out of the package. My other concern is that when the knife is closed, one sharp corner of the base of the blade juts out from the handle, creating a potential ""pocket-ripper"" situation. I don't know why this is so...as I've never seen it in another knife. I think Case should have rounded off that corner. It's almost as though the blade is too wide for the handle.Here is a follow-up to my review: I ground down the offending corner on a grinding wheel, so that it no longer is sharp. This should have been done in the manufacturing process."
503045,1,Great item. Lasted past my daughter. We finally gave it away because she outgrew it! Will recommend to more people.
232209,2,"The length is good but the pockets don't stay put in these shorts.Unfortunately, I am too lazy to sew them down so have to live with them."
361252,1,"so heres the deal... i bought this product over 2 months ago and i also bought one for my girlfriend. we decided who ever had nicer abs at the end of 3 months win the other person's pay check... At this point we dont care about the bet, were too busy enjoying our abs... i have the nicer abs because i didn't have too much fat to loose and she has a very sexy flat stomach... This product really does work if you loose weight and do cardio... the ab wheel strengthens and builds your abs.. to see the abs you need to shed the fat covering them. I used this product everyday starting at 3 sets of 12 reps a day... Remember to keep your back straight or you will get hurt.. i tore my lower abs because i did a rep wrong... she has never hurt herself because she does them slow and right.. so in short it works... if you do this and also do exercises on a ball it really gets you there even faster... the last month thats what i did and it made everything just speed up... i really love this ab product and i have always trusted everlast ( i use to be a Boxer) because they would never invest in crap... so take your time, do the reps right, watch your diet, loose the fat and you'll have a six pack in no time..."
160182,0,"I ordered these rollerskates to skate on in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and they were great going down the smooth surface of Central Park West, but once the parade hit the rough asphalt of 42nd Street on our way to Herald Square the front two wheels on my right foot came loose! Luckily, they held on long enouch for me to do a few loops around Johnny Weir in front of Macy's but I'll need a wrench to repair them before their next performance. Very cute though and I thought the sizing was only a half size off."

262151,0,"This gun lasted a while but it fell apart as i used it. The battery life is long but the fps is terrible. The guns attachments are added up to the price of the gun if you buy them separately, so that's nice. The magazine doesn't hold much ammo for the fire rate when it is fully charged."
310352,1,"Bottom line: It works for the price.The shovel seems to be made from decently durable material. I bought this to put in my trunk to use in case of being stuck in the snow. I haven't had to use it yet, but it seems like it would hold up fine to a mild amount of abuse...thus 5 stars.Enjoy."
204557,0,"I have this product. It's ok albeit a bit too large. For a beginner, you can't really tell when you're at the correction inflation point. It's listed as anti-burst but completely popped like a balloon after some average use."
306113,0,"I picked up this mat because I was looking for something inexpensive but well rated to get into yoga. This one seemed like a good deal.Yes, it does have a bit of a plasticky smell when you first get it, but that goes away over time and i was never really bothered by it. This mat served really well for the first few weeks of yoga, however now that I have moved into more advanced classes I found the real downfall. The grip on this mat is lacking. I have trouble holding several poses due to sliding. If you are one who sweats a lot during your practice I can imagine this problem is made worse.The slipping is bad enough that my practice is interupted almost every time. I will be looking around for a replacement, I have heard many people at my studio recommend Gecko and Jade Brand Yoga mats, so I will be taking a look at those as well."
356499,1,I won't rehash all that's already been said in other reviews. I will just say that this is the best motivational tool I have ever used. It is soooo simple to use. The website is very clean and efficient (and humorous). Ignore the reviews about clip problems. They are now shipping with much stronger clips. This is one of the few fitness products that ACTUALLY WORKS! Thanks SportBrain!
276275,2,"Do not buy if you don't have at least two burly friends. Even when you do, they will likely be injured in the making of this trampoline. The pieces don't fit together and the instructions don't help at all!! The box should come with gauze and bandages for your inevitable injury!! We spent half an hour on the first two steps in the instructions. AND FAILED. And we are two college graduates who work out. We considered it an accomplishment to put all the pieces back in the box so we could ship it back to god-foresaken place it came from!!!! Do not buy. This product has ruined my love of trampolines forever.Why can't the pieces just come welded together in a slightly larger box? Then, no injuries would occur. I should be CEO of this company. But if I were, I would just cease production on these trampolines."
285695,0,This is such a nice watch but it stopped working a month after I gave as a gift. My boyfriend still hasn't taken it in and I just hope it's the battery. Probably wont buy from them again because it was embarrassing for out to have broken so quickly. Luckily he is understanding
449555,1,I don't know how the receiver liked it as I've never seen it on him and he didn't tell me how he felt. I buy a lot of Hanes products for myself and I'm always please with how they look and how long they last

They are more like 11.5 They fit fine width wise, but my toe barely reaches the white rubber in the front. So word of advice, order a size smaller than you think."
90151,1,"I ordered the black Manduka mat after hearing recommendatioms from friends, and I'm glad I did. The mat is thicker, heavier and responsive to the body. Your feet feel both cradled and supported, while at the same time being firm enough to balance upon. This mat is amazing!!! Definately worth a try. You won't be disappointed."

29562,0,"I was thinking about ordering this after seeing the pictures, but was turned off by the seemingly high price.Then it occurred to me that you could accomplish the same thing as the device by putting your hands on the back of your head (where the strap on the pulley would normally go) instead of buying a pulley and putting it behind your head and holding it with your hands. Doesn't this seem easier, similarly efficient and more reliable?Then again, I think people would be better off if they ran in place instead of trying to keep up with a treadmill."

336885,1,I got these to clip pouches to my ALICE pack. They work like they are supposed to. My only negative comment is that they appear used. The paint is worn on them and you have to guide the end to make sure they close properly. But all in all nice clips.
53973,0,"I bought this based off the positive reviews, but I had to ship the first one back because the reticules selector knob wouldn't turn. The second one was better, but still sticks when you get to the last setting. The reticules also have like a ghost shadow to them. Not very crisp at all at any intensity settings. They even look like smudges on the &#34;inside&#34; of the scope. I could have just gotten a bad batch, but I can't completely recommend or not recommend it."
71553,2,"The wooden sword was warped and not straight. There was a one-inch curve difference from one edge of the sword to the other. I believe the wood was not dried enough and had warped due to humidity. Although the merchant agreed to take the sword back, the shipping cost that I paid in total would have cost the same as the sword."

157539,0,I have been looking for good hand weights to take on my walks and these seemed to be perfect. I took them out for a test drive and unfortunately they are too long (lengthwise) and too fat around for my hand to comfortably grip. It became annoying to hold for a lengthy walk. I liked that they had a comfortable handle strap but the shape of the hand weight was not suited for me and I returned them. I prefer a more slender handle that I can grip comfortably while I'm walking. Unfortunately I don't think this product is good for women's smaller hands.
299690,2,"These shorts were awful! I got them for my 21 year old dauther who goes to Juilliard. She is of normal height and stature (5'5"" size 5). They came down to her knees and looked terrible. Worse than that they will not let me return this useless item."
385784,0,"I recently bought this tent and used it during Labor Day Weekend. Anyone from the East Coast knows Hurricane Ernesto made it a wet weekend. So I really put this tent to the test. The tent did leak from the top, not so much. The netting from the inner tent caught the water and it streaked down the sides. However, the zipper to the entrance leaked. We had to keep a towel there to absorb the rain water. Condensation formed at the base of the tent, making it a miserable night to sleep. I'm only 5'8"" and I barely had room to lay down. So beware of this tent if you're 5'8"" and above. A third person could fit but it would be tight.The tent is very easy to put together. We got it up in less than 10 minutes while it rained. The front porch canopy was ok at best. Rain would collect on the top so I had to place a rock at the edge to allow the rain water to pour out. When it was open, it made it difficult to enter the tent. Its probably fine for kids though.Overall for the price you're paying, this tent is fantastic under dry conditions. But in rain, its 3 stars. Wouldn't you rather shell out a few extra bucks for a good rainproof tent rather than sleeping in a leaky damp tent? I know I wish I did."
230253,0,"I bought this a couple of years ago for 300 something dollars and was shocked when I saw the price it is now, over 400. When I received it the ups guy was not really happy about bringing it upstairs since I used to live on the second floor. I felt really bad but I couldn't help since I am 5'2"" and had very young children at the time. I put it together myself which was not to bad. I loved how quiet it was to start. But a few weeks later it started to squeek really bad and the screws that were put in constantly loosen. After about 2 years the handle bars kind of move around but tightening the screws doensn't do anything.Really I don't use it, my brother does and he doesn't mind it so I guess if you can live with some noise and tightening the screws all the time it wouldn't be bad but I don't think I would find it a great buy at over 400 dollars."

236057,0,the design is a kind of too simple. installing bikes is not very easy step and may not be safe for highway usage. the two clips which interface with the car trunk should be made of non-metal material otherwise it may damage the car trunk after a long time. be cautious when you close the trunk!
36968,2,"Like the other reviewer indicates in his review, I bought these shorts expecting a 10"" inseam, but they arrived with an 8"" inseam. The description lists these shorts as having a 10"" inseam. I wish I had read his review before ordering! I called the store (1-800-569-9038) and in their system, this short DOES have an 8"" inseam, so they think they sent me the appropriate item. They need to fix the info on this page! Anyway, I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error. I explained the situation, and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that. So in the end, I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me (they won't refund that) and of course, I never got the shorts I wanted. At least I don't have to pay to return them, thank goodness. Still-- it's annoying."
227314,0,"I know it says ""fender boot"" but it wasn't clear to me. I imagine if I wanted to keep my fender buoy clean, this item would do a great job at it though. So, as long as you aren't expecting an actual fender buoy, would recommend."

150454,1,This is an excellent watch at this price..looks good on the wrist and has very good features
207177,0,These are very cute and match everything however obviously being white they get dirty quick but that was not what I found fault in. The mesh on these gloves don't withstand repeated use very well. The mesh became weak after about 4 months and ripped. I have since ordered Valeo's black gloves for women that have no mesh. So far so good.
225241,2,"We bought this to keep car keys and prescription drugs away from our teenager. The first one never worked so we returned it. On the second one, we couldn't change the combination so we finally learned the one that it defaulted to. The 9v batteries died in it constantly and if the lock box is shaken (as teenagers are prone to do) the battery connector comes loose and then you can't even ""jump start"" it with another battery as indicated in the directions. The final straw was when our daughter admitted that all you had to do was pop it in the corner with a shoe and the door would spring open. False security."

While the mirror serves its purpose, i didn't like that a had to cut a hole in the rubber of one of handle bars to mount it and the adjustments only go in two directions, up and down left and right. Oddly enough I went down to 100yen store and found a bike mirror that just clips to my handle bars and has a greater range of flexibility. The product itself isn't bad, its just there are others out there for comparable prices."
136752,1,"I am 55 years old and have done Beachbody's P90X about three times and P90X plus about three times. Like many fans of their DVDs I was psyched to try this one as well. The first week I tried Insanity I think I threw up twice. P90X Plyometrics is a day off compared to this workout series. After my 60 days were up I felt like I could climb Everest. This is pure, flat out cardio and plyometric floor work with no weights and few breaks. Make no mistake about it, this is one tough workout. If you are looking for a good next step after P90X or a cardio program to interleave with your weight training and are in pretty good shape I highly recommend this one. Although you will be taking plenty of breaks the first few weeks, I noticed that after doing it for several months as part of my weight rotation, I could make it all the way through without a break. I bought this program for my sister and my girlfriend because they were afraid that weight training would cause them to bulk up and they swear by it. If you are into lifting you will find you will lose some muscle mass in the 60 day program and may, if you continue with it, want to work it into some kind of weight training. There is a 13 disk expanded version that includes an upper body weight training DVD that is pretty great as well. Shaun T is a very good trainer and will yell at you as opposed to Tony Horton who cuts you more slack. The cast is good as well and there is no hiding the fact that the workouts are kicking their butts. Get through this workout series and you will have major bragging rights."
335749,0,well it does go around 350 to 400 fps and it workes when i got really wellthe lazer scope sucks and the bipod gets loose so you have to tighten it and the iron sites work greatthe 2 clips clip together and its a bit hard to get them to clip on the reloading thing under the cheap handle is cheap after you pull it back alot tyhe pin comes loose and falls outthe gun is cheap plastic and when i was in a war someone shot my gun and it cracked itwhen you get it and it breaks try fixing it with anything you an use when the pin gets lost on the cocking meckanism use a small screw once this gun is fixed its still ok but its not the bestTHIS GUN SUCKS UNLESS YOUR GOING TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY TO MOD AND FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS

103894,2,"Just broke another flimsy arm on the sunglasses for the second time in a year and a half. I'm pretty careful with my stuff. If they didn't break so easily (thin and brittle), I would be happy with them. Because of their fragile nature, the $20 or so pricepoint is too high. They are probably worth more like $5."

Now I just have a flat yoga ball. Thanks for that."

139970,1,"Since purchasing Wii Fit, I have focused on similar Wii games. While I thoroughly enjoy Wii Fit, I have not found the same level of enjoyment with this game. With Wii Fit, I kept playing and unlocking new things. I have not found that same addiction with this game. Some of my movements do not register with the game. The connecting and disconnecting the nunchuk can get tiresome. Maybe it will grow on me in time."
14777,0,The product seems to be fine... I do notice a slight decrease in soreness while wearing this product. The only complaint I have as of right now is that the necklace is a bit stiff and wont lie flat around my neck. Tends to try and keep its oval shape. This may wear off in time. Great delivery time also.
469928,1,It's nice and sturdy but it came with no directions so we had to go by the pictures:(

368336,1,"This is a great jacket! I own one (for men) and I liked it so much I bought one for the wife! Compact, easy to pack in virtually any situation. She can carry this jacket in her purse! It's great as a wind breaker over a fleece as well."
472701,2,I bought these for my husband in the size that should have fit him but they were so tight even I couldn't wear them. Seemed to be well made and looked very nice but I'd suggest buying a size or two bigger than you think you will need.
321856,2,"The seller sent pants with the basic green camo pattern, not the timber pattern that is advertised, which is what I wanted. Since I have to pay shipping to return these, which is nearly half the price of the pants, it's not worth it."
78018,2,While using it for the third time the red (medium side) broke and pulled apart leaving a big hole in the product. Online Sports is an outstanding company and replaced it with the Black Power web per my request.
82015,0,"I needed more running/work out shorts, and I couldn't find anything to really beat this price. I love soffes, specifically because they ""move with your body"". They're normally not too baggy, falling down, or not fitting in those ""awkward"" areas.Either I've gotten to be a smaller size, or these shorts are knock-offs...because these shorts don't fit me like my other soffes. They're awkwardly baggy in the crotch, the bum isn't defined, the legnth is a bit longer than the others (even when ""properly"" rolled up).The main pro is that the material is very soft and comfortable. So I could see myself wearing these to the gym, and maybe even to bed on a warmer night.So bittersweet? I guess."
3841,1,"Great product, but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better. These type of shirts, however, provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples."
336426,0,"For a beginner, these darts are good enough to learn how to throw without going to some of the more expensive darts. They function quite well and come with most accessories that one would need for a beginner.My only complaints are: The case that these come in is cheap; and the set I got were light at 17g.However, after having these darts for a few months and becoming much better at throwing, I am inclined toward getting heavier darts and wish that I had just spent the extra money in the beginning."
436162,2,"Perhaps I received a defective unit, but the tire was a bit difficult to get seated on the rim. I did manage after a while and it stayed on when pumped up to the recommended pressure. When I took it for a ride the next day, the tire popped off the rim about 3 minutes into the ride. The explosion was loud enough to scare several pedestrians. I've never had this issue any other tires I've used with this rim (Gatorskins, Serfas Seca, Gommitalia Calypso)."

The idiot company Bonide doesn't print anywhere on their label (or put anywhere on their website) what exactly this product contains.Found out later that it contains potassium pyrosulfate. What also should be noted is that the container is only 1/3 full of the substance. Why the hell waste all that packing material????

485479,0,"This is the second one I have bought, the first one sprung a leak when the cat knocked it off the counter and may or may not have chewed on it. I was happy with it up until then. If this one springs a leak I will not be buying a third."
366641,2,i have purchased shorts like these for a long time and these are by far the worst in quality...they are too thin and shrink too much. it is kind of a bumber because they are the only ones i can find in white. hopefully they will change the fabric content so the quality will be better...
365112,0,"I had this jacket for 2 years and it worked great. Lightweight and very waterproof, but then the lining started peeling off on the inside, rendering it no longer waterproof.

So far I have used it on large books, and so I use it to hold one side of the book open, because it won't fit on the top or bottom. Time will tell how long this will last.

I have a bit of tennis elbow and some pain in my arm even when at rest. I placed one of these disks on a tension spot and the pain immediately went away. What the heck? So, I'm worried that there's some sort of chemical pain reliever embedded in the disks and don't find it in the description. I don't know how it works, but it does."

358510,0,"This excercise machine is a good rendition of the old spring centered design for the same purpose of toning abs. I've used it with great success and happy, toned-abs but I miss the older model for a greater level of resistance. I figure someone redid the design after a few kids got their fingers pinched in the spring center.This model however still has a problem in the foam-overlay on foot supports. If you're not careful kids will use the foam-overlay AS the foot supports and rip them from the supports for a now ripped ab excerciser.. workable, but more bothersome.Bring Back the older Model!"
246625,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."
443892,0,"I bought this for my road bike. I like the size of it being a 24oz. The only thing that was wrong with it was that the nipple was hard to pull with your teeth. Riding a bike and having to grasp the bottle with one hand to squeeze the water out, you resort to your teeth to pull out the nipple which is hard. Did not like that feature. This is more of a walking bottle and to be used with 2 hands."
266450,0,"This rig is pretty good for the price. I have one major complaint - the Velcro retention strap on the inside has a very hard corner, from where it was melted to prevent fraying. This tends to dig into your leg, causing discomfort. A thick sock helped, but it does become uncomfortable after a while. If it weren't for this, I would give it 5 stars.I will say that it holds the pistol very securely to your leg, and it does not move about. I think it felt just as secure without the upper strap as it does with, but I also generally wear it inside a pair of cowboy boots. I bought the size 10 and it fits a Colt Mustang and a Taurus TCP, both in 380, very well."
170431,0,"Bag is not made in USA. I am looking at my bag right now and tag reads made in china. Interior vinyl in upper section is cracked after 3 mo. of use. This is where end panels fold when zippered. Upper and lower sections are insulated so both can be used to keep food cool. Most bottles or cans will have to be stored sideways. Keeps food cold all day with one older Coleman 40 oz ice pack. Overall average bag, killer looks, big enough for full meal and days worth of liquids. Just take 'U.S.A.' out of product description. I know it doesn't say 'Made In' but why else would it be there?"
216193,2,"THIS BIKE WAS PURCHASED FOR MY SON'S BIRTHDAY, IT ONLY GOES 5 MILES AN HOUR, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 4 MONTHS FOR A NEW BATTERY. I CAN NOT RETURN THE BIKE FOR CREDIT OR CASH. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE AND MY SON STILL CAN NOT RIDE. SO I WISHED I READ THESE OTHER REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT OURS. HONDA SHOULD REALLY BE ASHAMED AND SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THERE PRODUCTS."
136936,1,"I purchased this machine from dickssportinggoods.com (cheapest) a couple months ago and so far it works great. I will say that amazon's claim that it only weighs 50 lbs is a big fat lie, DSG states it's 165 and I'd say that's a lot closer, but once I found help carrying it up the stairs, setup was fairly simple and only took about an hour to do alone.I'm 5'8 and I find the tread length to be great for both sprinting and walking. The treadmill's instructions contain a warning against using any sort of silicon lubricant on the tread, as it doesn't need it, so you'll save a few bucks on that. The arms have adjustable tension, from super-easy to moderately stiff, and the first time I used it I was surprised that my arms really did get tired after just a 30-minute workout. Combined with the 10% incline, I feel that I get a great workout without even having to go above 3.6 mph. But I've also done long stints in the 7.5 range and jumped it up as fast as 9.5 and it continues to spin smoothly without any unnerving vibrations or belt looseness or anything.The console has no bells or whistles, which is fine for me, though I do find it handy that it has a little digital track display so you can see what your progress would be if you were on a real 1/4 mile track. The heart rate hand grips are an awkward shape for gripping tightly so I've found it impossible to get an accurate reading, but the old-fashioned finger-on-the-neck method works just fine for measuring my pulse.Overall I'm pleased with this machine - it's nothing fancy but it's sturdy enough for the intermediate runner or distance walker. My only complaints would be the weight and the heart rate monitor, but they are not insurmountable problems and the adjustable arms are neat enough to help me forget those two problems."
457460,0,"hard to fit on 48SP wheels dang near impossible on 100spoke best on mags but very durible finish and they get so stuck i gotta use them rubber ""powertool"" things of my moms to get them off and i am NOT week im 15"

Like how the inner lining is zipped into the outer shell so you feel as if you are putting on one jacket versus having to zip up the inner and outer layer, like I had to do with an older jacket. Also has many pockets - has been perfect through the current cold streak we are going through on the east coast!!"
274055,0,I had a vest like this one from about 5 years ago but it wore out and I wanted to get a replacement. I got it and it is as warm as the last one but the material seems a bit thin. Not sure how long it is going to last but 5 years would really surprise me.
496635,1,"I really like this shirt! I bought 2 and will buy at least 3 more..! Are very confortable and good looking..! If you're planning to go somewhere very warm, this is the shirt that suits you! The product arrived just as expected and ready to wear"

97424,2,"True, it is nice to have analog and digital. True, the watch looks nice in a rough-kinda way. However it stops there: looks. This is actually a delicate watch for its appearance. Read prev reviews and you will learn about the tendency for hands to fall off. And after you change your 1st battery you better not get any water close to it. Mine works intermittently. First I thought it was the battery, so I had it changed but to no avail, it still works when it wants to. My much cheaper Timex has needed no battery replacement after 2 years, it also has analog and digital and I have even scuba dived with it and it is still going."
448185,0,This bike lock is sturdy and strong but not too heavy to carry in a bracket on your bike. The bracket socket on the lock is in a weird place that makes it hard to anchor it straight on your bike. I settled for a creative solution that most people can figure out given a little thought and time. The lock is hard to remove when you unlock it but that may be for security reasons. Just don't expect this one to come off as quickly as some other U-locks when you unlock it. But it gets the job done and is secure.
140055,1,"I am two days away from finishing my 30 day challenge, and I have absolutely LOVED this game! Once I figured out the proper positioning of the nunchuk, I was rockin' and rollin'! I started the 30 day challenge on the high intensity level, and I certainly find it to be a good workout. The only complaint I would have is that I wish they would have set up the controllers to be able to use two remotes instead of the nunchuk because the cord sometimes gets in the way on certain exercises, and is not long enough for others to get full range of motion. Other than that, I have loved it! I am sad now that the 30 day challenge is almost over because I am wondering how the game will continue to try and motivate me to continue. Since I started with high intensity, I won't digress back to low or medium... so I wonder where I will go from there. I can't wait to find out if it will keep my interest in a couple more days once that challenge is completed..."
240655,1,"comfortable, has held up well so far. I wish it were a tad thicker, but that's not a big deal really. this is great for working around the house or riding. keeps the sun from burning you too bad, etc."
138986,1,This little elecric bike is a great option if gasoline engines are a hassle. There's enough speed to zip all over 5 acres but not enough to be very dangerous (driven reasonably). I only wish it was a little taller.Overall its great.

34051,1,I have used these gloves all winter long. They have kept my hands warm down to 15 degrees. the design of the gloves with the two smallest fingers together keeps them warm and still allows the index and middle finger lose to work the shifters. Best cold weather gloves I've ever had
54505,1,"Just received this sight yesterday, and to be honest, I was expecting some cheap plastic thing for what I paid for it. I was never so wrong about anything! This thing is all aluminum construction, even the flashlight that I was certain would be made of plastic! Fits perfectly snug on my picatinny rail with 3 allen screws on the aluminum clamp. The flashlight mount is a bit wobbly, but doesn't feel like it's going to fall off and the quick release is always a plus. My only gripe is that the flashlight switch doesn't seem to work properly and so it requires twisting the battery cap to turn it on/off. The flashlight is extremely bright though! Altogether, I'm quite happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone. Just can't beat the quality for the price."
146412,2,"I was so excited to read the great reviews on this trike when we bought it for my 2 year old son. I researched trikes for weeks before deciding on this one. Now I'm only wishing my husband had saved the box so we could return it. Basically we're just taking the loss on the money paid and buying a different brand entirely.The construction is TERRIBLE, the seat doesn't tighten and just falls to the side no matter what you do, and if anything at all even slightly touches the metal, the paint chips right off. We are extremely disappointed - as is our son who can't even ride his new trike because the seat's so completely unsafe."
112644,1,This is a great quality belt for the price. Tiger Claw makes some nice products.
26383,1,"This basket works great, and has a TON of space. Just be aware that it's WAY bigger then you think it is from the picture. I had problems swinging my leg up and over it to get on my bike. But if you want a ton of storage (that's very sturdy) on the back of your bike, this thing is great."
315128,1,"I bought the 1090's about five months ago. No regrets. They are sturdy, well built and sylish if your going to have them out where guests might see your workout area. The optional stand you can buy for them is highly recommended by me. Saves your back after each lift.If you're doing any type of full body workout, instead of just isolation moves, you know that changing the weights for each move is a pain. These puppies allow quick, simple changes and you move through your circuit with ease. For those who think the price is a little high, I was sticker shocked also but Amazon gave me a great deal on them rather than buying them directly from Bowflex. But no matter what you pay from either seller, these are worth it."
303231,1,"Before I got this I thought the ab muscles in 300 were a digital special effect. I though there was no way someone could be in that sort of shape.I'd seen the infomercials a few times and was skeptical. 90 days and I would be super fit? I'm really skinny.But then I thought, ""I guess it makes sense. If you workout everyday for an hour or more, and eat right, you should get really fit."" If the infomercial was telling me I just had to workout every other day for 15 minutes I wouldn't believe it, but it was really asking me to commit to something.Now I'll tell you it is a huge commitment. I did it for 4 weeks and then started school and did not have any free time to do it. Most of the time it would take me 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete the workout. But in those 4 weeks I made so many muscles. My face got thinner and muscles I didn't know you were supposed to have showed up.I didn't use it for about 18 weeks when I was really busy. I thought I lost everything I did in 4 weeks, and then I started again. After 1 week everything I had before came back. I've been doing it now for 3 weeks, so I'm only 1 month into it, but let me say I'm getting awesome fit. I am so excited. I am happy to be where I am just after a month, but I might as well go for superfit.It is an extremely intense workout. You do what you can and you get better. The ab workout is about 3 days a week, 16 minutes long, but is the most intense thing ever. After a while though you can feel the muscles you are building and it feels great.I don't want to just be a muscle head, so I'm glad core, cardio, and yoga are included. This actually really turned me onto Yoga. The whole thing, exercising and everything has really pulled me out of the more depressed state I used to be in. I feel so good about myself now.I did spend a lot of money getting set up. I bought bowflex selecttech weights. I bought bands to simulate pullups. I bought pushup stands. I bought a yoga mat. I spend about $20 a month on recovery drinks. I use accelerade which is great, keeps my muscles from ever aching. I spend about $20 a month on vitamins.I am very impressed. I would say my physique is now rival to some guys I know that work at gyms and take tons of weight gaining supplements. I see some of these guys with tiny legs or shoulders or weak backs or abs. I'm getting the full workout here. I'm even surprised how much muscle I've been putting on without supplements. I am also a vegetarian and just eating lots of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains.IT IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME. IT IS HARD WORK, BUT IT WORKS."
152307,0,"As leggings I'm sure these would suit anyone's purpose, but I was looking for more of a support garment - something with a squeeze factor - and these just didn't do that. They would have been very comfortable to wear for nearly any activity, but they weren't what I was looking for."
462247,1,"I was looking for a lightweight ski that I could use as an all mountain ski. I ordered these skis from one ski shop and lightweight Marker Titanium 12.0 bindings with flame pads from another one. When I took my skis to have the bindings mounted and picked them up the ski tekkies wanted my skis - they looked hot. I couldn't wait to get them on the slopes. I flew home to Aspen and went skiing. The skis/bindings were light and easy to turn. Even though I've been skiing for years and taught skiing, I still had the bad habit of ""skiing in the backseat"" every so often. But, with twin tip styling (no skidding allowed), I learned to stand right over the sweet spot. If I didn't, I caught the back edges of my skis in the snow so I rapidly learned to adjust. I took a lesson with a video analysis included. After the filming my instructor and I went into the hut to ""analyze"" my turns. Another instructor was pointing out how nice and smooth my turns were to his student. My instructor told me the same thing. I highly recommend these skis whether you want to get big air in the pipes or if you just want a great ski to play with, improve your technique, and ski longer."
26980,0,This is the weakiest red dot I own. it gets the job done but I would not use this red dot on any thing other than a paintball gun. Its lense cap already got lost on the first game I took it on as they really dont stay on too tight. It does come with two sets of batteries however. I really dont like the on off dial. It feels very chessy. the dot gets very burly as it gets more dialed. Nc star makes better dots!

312587,0,"The build quality of this tent is very lightweight and very good from my current experiences with it. It stayed dry in a moderate rain and dried quickly. I purchased this for motorcycle camping because it is lightweight and packs small, smaller than what is claimed.I am 6'2"" and I am cramped in this tent but I do fit. There is not enough room for 2 inflatable sleeping pads in this tent. I only have room for my Big Agnes pad and just barely. Unless they are very small people with very small gear, I would call this a one man tent.What I like: lightweight, good build quality, very small package size (about 6""x9"" tent & fly with light compression), the best tent poles I've ever used (quickly snap together without effort), I stayed dry, 3 storage pockets, vestibules, lots of mesh for good ventilation, storm lashing for stability, super fast & easy set up.What I don't like: vestibules too small, tent is too small for my comfort, fly vent too small to be very effective, entry during rain lets in water.For my intended use, it is a good tent. However, I will likely sell it and find something more suitable for my size and something with a dry entry during rainy conditions. I would purchase another ALPS product again with hesitation."

338648,0,"I checked the rating on various pedometers before I purchased. This one had a very good rating. Problems I have had with it are:1. Very uncomfortable attached to waistband because it is so tall. It is fine to put in my pocket, but I don't always have pockets. It will come out of the holder when attached to waistband.2. It will reset itself just by being bumped??? Also, the 2 readings for steps are misleading - did I walk a total of the 2 step readings? - is the step reading on the #2 register also included in the step register #1?3. Being in my pocket, I am not sure how accurate the reading is. I need to test it."
420844,0,"This stock has not failed or broken, so I give it 3 stars for being adequate. However, I think that it wouldn't be long before it does. It feels flimsy. The latching mechanism is awkward and not what I expected. While holding the gun level, the stock is pressed toward the ground, then swung around. It's very slow and unintuitive. The small composite ""catch"" that keeps it in place is just too light for my comfort. The same can be said for the composite hinge. I know that this is speculative, I am just sharing my opinion, but it just doesn't feel sturdy. I have read on other forums that many people who attempt to use this stock in various qualifications that require maneuvering while carrying the weapon by the sling, often end up with it snapping apart.What's not speculative is that the sling attachment point is not as useful as it could be. With a slightly different placement, it could accomodate a wider variety of slings (like the standard soviet issue leather).Why did I choose an AK-47? Because it's known for one thing: rugged dependability. Why would I use an accessory for it that does not have that same feeling of performing under any conditions?If you just have the rifle for sake of having it, or you only go to and from the range, this may be a good purchase. I have a moderately expensive MAK-90 that I plan on carrying across varying terrain in unpredictable conditions. I'm just not confident that this stock will stand up to that, so I am going with the Israeli made Mako instead."

85698,0,"I bought this clamp/puller about a year ago. Since then I have used it to hold dozens of clubs for regripping and FLO. I also have used the puller to reshaft about 20 clubs. This is a well designed unit that I mounted to a piece of 2x4 wood and could then easily clamped into a bench vise. Looks good and quickly clamps and releases.As a puller it is marginal. There is not enough rubber in the clamp and there is a lot of slippage under the pressure of the pulling. Also due to the soft metal, the shaft adapter doesn't exactly pull straight under load. That said, I was able to pull the 20 shafts decently. The slippage got worse over time and I finally ended up using too much heat and ruined a shaft.The rubber pads eventually slipped out, I substituted a piece of grip in there to help hold things. But again, could not hold well enough for shaft pulling. The solution is to get a rubber vise clamp like you see everywhere that normally would normally protect a shaft when clamped into a vise. Put this rubber piece around the shaft and into the UCO clamp. This holds for pulling. This should have been used in the original design.Even after that, the aluminum is not strong enough and the handle eventually broke off. The puller adapter also got some serious grooving where the puller touches the hosel and is now sharp and will scratch shafts.In summary. It is an inexpensive product that works well with limited use. I recommend to use a rubber vise clampRubber Vice Clampbetween the jaws and prepare for a little bending/breaking/distortion of the soft metal over time."
356948,0,"So, I'm a beginner archer and i baught this set. It took forever to get here. The bow itself is pretty good, but is hard to string without a bow stringer so i recommend buying one. The arrows are a different matter. It come with two and a really flimsy quiver. One of the nocks in an arrow broke after a few shots. I'm not kidding either. The tips dent very quickly. Today was my first day using it because i had to wait for my bow stringer to get here. I'm highly considering buying more arrows. The picture doesn't show it but, the set also comes with a target. The other things, like the finger guard and the arm guard are okay. The finger guard was barely more than a scrap of leather with holes in it and the arm guard was really tiny."

142074,0,"I own a pair of these and 3 pair of the Howard Leight Impact Sport Electronic Earmuff for my family. The performance of the Peltor Tactical Pro is superior for comfort and hearing protection. I use them primarily at the shooting range and find that they protect my ears better when sitting next to someone shooting a very loud rifle.I prefer the volumne control dial on the Howard Leight to the buttons on the Tac Pro, but that is not a deal killer. What has me concerned however is the durability of this unit. After only my fourth trip to the range the right foam microphone protector fell off. This is because the ear cups are so thick that in order to get a good cheek weld you sometimes bang the earphone on the rifle butt, and what hits first is the microphone protector.Then on the next trip I noticed that the left protector came off in my range bag. This is because the these foam protectors are not recessed and are not well attached and when they come off they do not go back on. The Howard Leight however is designed with the microphone covers recessed just enough.At the end of the day on sixth day at the range I noticed that the right ear had NO volume at all and had apparently failed.So, for a while I have been using my Howard Leight set and they are OK, but sometimes I have to put some foam plugs in my ears to ensure I get enough protection.Bottom line - For the price these things should be higher quality. I like them and I'm going to try to get them repaired, but if you are buying your first ACTIVE hearing protection, I recommend you buy the Howard Leights first. For the price you can try them out and if they are not good enough buy better ones and keep the Leights for backup.I wrote 3M Peltor a letter yesterday, if Peltor tries to gouge me for repair, I'll probably look elsewhere. I hate to make the leap to ProEars, but maybe that's what I'll have to do to get what I want. Performance and quality, of course the price for ProEars is ridiculous.I'm tired of simple products costing more than they should and being poor quality.Dang 3M Peltor, this kind of engineering is NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. Just pay attention and build a better product."

305152,0,I've been using this mat 1-4 times a week for a year and a half and I have mixed feelings. I feel good about buying an eco-friendly mat but this one has its disadvantages. The bulk is cumbersome which gets annoying in my Iyengar classes when I fold it up twice for Sirsasana or put it on the seat pan of a folded chair for supported backbends. Also I work up a sweat in my practice even without being in a hot room and this thing gets slippery immediately. I had to buy a number of Yogitoes towels for any sort of warm or vinyasa classes or sessions heavy on standing poses. Even an extended Adho Mukha Svanasana is annoyingly difficult without a towel for my sweaty hands. The mat shows sweat stains easily but I clean it with water and a bit of apple cider vinegar which is no problem. I'm in the market for another mat to bring to class but I'll probably keep this for my home practice.

Since the case is featured as part of the product, I gave it a lower rating being that the fabric has been unraveling since it arrived and the contruction and materials are of poor quality and looks saggy and sad.

203673,1,"I like this knife for the following reasons. It is sharp, lightweight, cool looking, and rugged. This knife is easy to operate with one hand because of the assisted opening feature. I own the newest version of this model which now has the arc lock instead of the piston lock. With the arc lock it is much easier on the finger to unlock the blade when folding it up (huge upgrade). SOG has also added jimping to the finger groove area to get a better grip. A couple of things I do not like about this knife is the blade play from right to left when opened and in the locked position, you can tighten the pivot screw to get rid of this play. Also there is blade play up and down just slightly when in the locked position (can't do much about that). Finally SOG put's an electronic anti-theft stick plate on the inside of the handle which can be removed if you take the handle apart. Why they do this is beyond me because most manufacturers put those stickers on the inside of the packaging. Not a deal breaker but it can be annoying! Overall a great knife and I would recommend it knowing it needs a few tweaks to tighten the blade and lose the theft sticker."
368395,0,Good and bad for this jacket. First the price is to much. I paid $74.00 but it should have been lower because there is nothing to this jacket. It feels like your wearing a piece of plastic lined with netting.

The sleeves are long enough for me as I am 5'8 and it is hard to find a jacket with sleeves long enough.

However, as time goes by, the springs eventually fatigue and the span grows shorter and shorter. Also, IMHO the weight ratings are way over rated. I can do a couple dozen reps with each hand on the 250# heavy gripper, but only about 5 on the Captain of Crush #2, which I believe is rated at only 195#.If you are thinking of purchasing this entire set - save your $$$ and buy the #1, #2 and #2.5 COC grippers."

However, we found that if we weren't planning to spend several hours at the beach it wasn't worth the time and effort to set up and it doesn't perform well in wind. There are also three separate bags and several loose pieces that were often getting misplaced. After the first year, we rarely used the tent and we were not disappointed when one of the poles finally broke b/c it gave us an excuse to buy a Sport Brella."

Also keeps the air I'm breathing warmer and moister which is great when it gets really cold. It is pretty comfortable, enough so that once I get going I stop noticing it is on. Sometimes have to reposition it, but nothing that compromises its purpose.

360820,0,"I did some research on pull-up bars through other customer reviews, and the Everlast bar had the fewest negative reviews (that's not saying much). Many of the negative customer reviews on Everlast were because the customers had old doorways and the bar didn't work for them. I live in a new house, so I figured that I wouldn't have a problem with the door size.The pull-up bar was straightforward to assemble, but I must admit that I spent awhile trying to figure out how it was mounted on the doorway. After looking at the picture and trying out different ways of mounting the bar, I finally realized that the bar just mounted on the doorframe, and had nothing to do with the door itself. The reason it took so long for me to figure that out was that it doesn't look safe or secure. There's a tiny sand-paper-like band on the wooden bracket that's supposed to hold it in place on one side of the doorframe, but that's a joke. I only weigh 165 pounds, and after three normal pullups, the whole contraption fell, and me with it. Most of the sand-paper tape came off the wooden bracket, showing how precarious the whole doorframe mounting idea was in the first place.I'll just have to find a way to mount this thing on the wall, the doorway frame mounting idea is a joke!"

It traps moisture inside and I end up with a visibly damp shirt and have to turn the jacket inside out to dry. That's what happens in dry weather. The fit is comfortable and it's otherwise conveniently designed. The fabric in white is quite see-through.

313683,0,"These are very comfortable gi pants. They are a good heavy weight, but soft cotton, not the heavy canvas type, flexible and easy to move in. I've had several different gi pants, and these are, by far my favorite. They are elastic waistband, rather than drawstring, but I prefer that. And as a female martial artist it can be difficult finding gi pants that fit well, but these are definitely the best I've worn.Update to this review: I had decided to purchase another pair of gi pants and ordered these again since I liked them so much the first time. Unfortunately, the gi pants that arrived this time were nothing like the first. The previous pants were brushed cotton, elastic waist. The pants I received the second time were the heavy canvas type material, drawstring waist, and had the ProForce label on the front, exactly what I did not want. I'm guessing the description is intentionally confusing because the pants come from different vendors and Tiger Claw has no idea what may really be shipping? At least I was able to return them without difficulty and was able to find another pair of gi pants elsewhere that fit perfectly. Just be aware when ordering the gi pants may be different than what you expect."

360533,1,"When I first got this carabiner in the mail I wondered what it was then when I opened the envelope I was surprised to find it was bigger and heavier than I thought but for a strength of 72,000 lbs It is actually just right. It's very sturdy and probably the best 30 dollars I have spent on a carabiner. If you need something strong and want the best of the best this omega pacific carabiner is what you should get"
255888,2,"I cancled the order yet I have been billed by amazon. Be very careful they do not tell you its size or give you the option to choose size you hit the button and the order is complete without giving the size. Yet it tells you to order the next size up if you need a half size, very deceiving"
97472,2,"I have been purchasing this model (or very similar) Casio watch for nearly the last 14 years. I usually get about 3-4 years of reliable service then the battery begins to fail. Unfortunately even though I've used different high-end jewelers to replace the batteries, they all leaked water afterward. No big deal since otherwise they've held up very well , they're fairly inexpensive, and didn't mind buying a new one every few years.The last one I purchased locally a few years ago finally start showing signs the battery was dieing. The digital display and time still work fine but the mechanical hands start to fail. I decided to order a replacement from Amazon. My first Casio dive watch from Amazon started showing the dreaded signs of battery failure after just a couple of months. I figured it was a fluke so I ordered another. The second Casio divers watch of this same model has now also started showing signs of the battery failing after just 3 months. I'm guessing Amazon must have a lot of old new stock sitting on their shelves or Casio is supplying them with old stock that has been sitting around a few years. Needless to say I've given up on this Casio model, at least from Amazon."

196528,0,"This item is described and displayed on the Web site as a ""topside"" tank (no handle and two ridges for strapping it down). Unfortunately what I received was a portable tank (lower profile, with a handle and no ridges for strapping it down). I realize that portable tanks sometimes come without handles, but I have never seen a topside tank that comes with handle.My bad for not double-checking the dimensions that were listed in the item description as they are accurate for the item that was sent. The item pictured looks more like 10"" W x 24"" L x 12"" H. On the Web site it says: Dimensions - 13 3/4"" W x 29 1/2"" L x 10"" H. While this clearly does not describe the item pictured, it describes the item that was sent pretty accurately.So Amazon, switch-out your picture and everyone will be happy.Maybe you actually want a portable tank, in which case the tank that was delivered is fine.Mine goes back unfortunately as I won't be able to use it in my boat.I'll be trying to add a customer picture to the Web site to hopefully clear-up some of the confusion that my rambling may have caused :)Have fun on the water and be safe!"

45102,2,"Bianchi has been around and is well known for thier gun leather, so I mistakenly thought this belt would be appropriate and provide adequate support for use with a concealed carry, outside the waitband holster. Not so.This belt is made in Mexico. Leather thickness varies from .133"" to .155"". After a month of wear, the belt is sagging and showing areas of ripples and weakened areas in the leather. I'm not overweight (waist 33, 6'1"" tall), so I'm not putting any undue or unusual stresses on the belt.If you are looking for a belt for utility use, to carry a weapon or other tools that may weigh more than a cell phone - - this ain't it.

231257,1,I usually have frequent flats on the route I take around town. I have been riding on this tire for about 4 months now without a flat. It is also a nice looking tire. I have been gradually reducing my tire width for reduced rolling resistance. This 1 3/8 inch tire rolls very smoothly.
15022,0,"In all honesty, the watch is probably more of a 3.5 than a 3. It's not a 4 (at least on my scale)simply because it doesn't keep very good time. It kind of reminds me of the old digital watches you could get from mailing in cereal box tops.The logo and band are very nice and you can show your team pride, maybe just fall back on using something else to give you an accurate time."

321355,0,"I originally bought this cap because I was afraid of hair getting snagged. (I have long, fine hair that falls out when pulled a lot) But when using it, the design seemed short enough to cover some of my hair. (I have a small head) It covers my hair tied up when when in attempt of diving or put my head in the water, eventually, I can feel the bubble inside the cap. Then, it comes loose often. So, if you're looking to keep your head dry, it will, if you can keep it on long enoughPoint is: I might have to invest on the silicone one. I just want to try swimming without having to put the cap back on several times. I like this lycra enough to not have my hair snag. They should make a bigger or longer"
301283,0,"Been wearing these pants for over two years now and have not been very impressed. I love the lightweight material and the fact that these are convertible, but the cargo pockets are flimsy and the Velcro has worn out to the point where any heavier items, like a leatherman, will make the pockets impossible to close. I've lost a good multitool and a zippo out of these pockets. The built-in belt is comfortable with a backpack, but it will not stay tightened and it makes it impossible to hang tools off a belt. I tore the seam in the seat while rock climbing and the seam in the crotch is starting to go. If you need a comfortable, light duty pant for backpacking or traveling, buy these. If you are looking for something to climb, trek, bushwack, or work in, keep looking."

35287,1,"Love my new Urban Rebounder. Unfolded easily and legs popped right into place. Within 15 minutes after delivery, I was literally jumping for joy! The most difficult part of the assembly, was getting the trampoline out of the box (it's very well-packaged). Some people noted a lingering odor. I have a sensitive nose and smelled nothing offensive, at all...My rebounder is black with a red band, perhaps it is an improved model. I use it with my Wii Fit program; makes running so much easier on my ankles, while giving a more vigorous workout. It is also quiet enough to hear the remote & TV. Do not hesitate to purchase this item. It is well built and of very high quality materials...Not a kid's toy. Try it, you'll LOVE it!"
46557,0,"At first, I was very leery about how secure this bike rack was. After loading my bike on it, I drove 30 miles and thought that the bike was pretty secure. When I got home, I looked and saw that the bottom strap had come loose from the bumper of my car. Regardless of how much I tighten the bottom strap, it still seems to move quite a bit and shift. When using the rack, I worry about that bottom strap. It does show an alternate way to secure the strap on the inside of the trunk. I have yet to try it out, but hopefully it will prove to be much more secure than on the outside near the bumper."
455959,1,I purchased this pogo stick for my grandson's 8th. birthday. He really loves it and just can't stop jumping on it. He has a twin sister whom I purchased a different type of pogo stick for and it's just not as easy to use as this one! I would recommend this pogo stick to people with active children. This is a great form of exercise. So far so good with the quality of the product. I will give the pogo stick five stars! Thanks Amazon for the speedy shipping and great price. In a week I will purchase this same pogo stick for another granddaughter!

115595,0,"These are cut a little big, and that's pretty typical for a rain jacket. It feels rubberized to the touch, and does keep you very dry. There are air vents under the armpits small enough that they should't let water in-- great feature. There are also two huge pockets on the front to keep items you need to keep dry.The only thing I don't like about this jacket is that it makes a lot of plastic noise. If you're out in the rain, this doesn't matter, but any time it's not raining you're going to be ""loud"".If I am going to be wearing a jacket for rain purposes I would personally prefer the Columbia Omni-tech or Titanium Tech jacket. Far more stylish, quieter, and better ventilation, at more cost."

176695,0,"1. the ""Oxford"" shorts are shown as a dark maroon kind of colour, which is what I wanted, but NO! I received them in a heather grey colour, even though the packaging still says ""Oxford"". So BEWARE! I don't know if it is a photo error or a packaging error; either way, not worth the postage to return it2. they are small but NOT THAT SMALL! I read the reviews extensively before finally buying them. Previously, someone reviewed saying that she's an S-M and a XL would fit perfectly - which is what I bought. But both pairs arrived amazingly big. I think my boyfriend can wear them! I folded the waistband (note: elastic band, not strings) down twice and the shorts are still too long and too baggy and make my butt look 50% bigger. I'm a size 4 or 6 (ie S or M), and if I were to buy again, I would get size M, or at most L. So be careful when you up the sizes!Unfortunately these were not a good buy for me. I gave it 3 stars, however, because I think if you were lucky enough to get the right size and colour, they would be pretty good and they seem very comfortable."

441189,1,"I was not sure how to approach this review, so I will make it simple. Seiko have (in my opinion) designed one of the most aesthetic timepieces of the modern age. I owned the great and mighty Tag S/El Chronograph, another fantastically designed watch in a sea of humdrum looking pieces. Yes there are more expensive Breitlings and Rolexes, and from a technical perspective these and some elite other marques are more advanced and complex in their mechanisms be they mechanical or otherwise if compared to the Seiko.Anyway it comes with a leather case in the form of a cylinder with rooom for three watches - included also is a precision tool for resizing your carbonized titanium strap OR taking it off and putting the alternative sumptious leather strap with orange stitching (bear in mind this is a watch designed for Motorsport - I believe). My humble Motorsporting is taking my M5 out for a thrashing now and again at the nearby race track in Karlskoga - so I did not purchase this watch to time my laps in the F1 car (I wish!).Also cool is there are only 2005 of these watches and on the back you can see which number of the 2005 your watch is.Anyway I bought the watch and put it on straight away - I had to shake it 200 times to charge it for use, but once worn full time - you dont have to worry about this again as the Kinetic movement charges the capacitor/battery for continous timekeeping - if fully charged it will run for a month if not used.Ok cost wise its not for everyone - but for those who have an interest in watches - and I don't just mean the elite mechanical masterpieces with a million jewels and umpteen thousand moving parts, but in design and function - this is a superb watch, with very low maintenace attached.There is no watch on this planet in terms of looks that makes me go WOW! Other than the SLQ019 - nicely done Seiko!"
417584,2,This was the first Fisher Price toy that I was disappointed with.Assembly itself is time consuming and cannot be accomplished without drilling extra holes as other reviews state.The handle bar is not stable.Additionally there is no seat belt and so the child can fall off as has occurred with mine.I would not recommend this product for smaller kids.In hind sight I wish I had put in the extra money and purchased the Little Tikes 3 in one trike.
32733,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
253941,0,"This is a stylish item and is probably fine for most people. The heat & exhaust from my jet-pack seems to have melted the dorsal plates after only a short period of usage. I have retrofitted this product with porcelain plating to improve its heat & flame resistance; a useful feature not only for jet propulsion but also for battling evildoers wielding flamethrowers or molotov cocktails. I recommend the manufacturers of this item provide a factory-available option with this modification. Also, the forearm plates had to be cut down as they did not leave adequate room for my spiked Enemy Fighters and vambraces. Perhaps there can be a future A3J iteration designed specifically for crime fighters."

84929,1,"Product just arrived today after about 5 business days. The first thing I noticed about these gloves is that they are not completely leather. The inside is some other sort of material, which is understandable because it seems to aid in drying. The leather on the outside is thin but again, it's understandable being as they're cheap. I used them for about 30 minutes on the bag and they seemed to work pretty well. I bought them a size up so I could fit wraps underneath (which was suggested by others) but I tried them without wraps as well and they felt fine. Others have mentioned that the material is rough on their hands, but it seemed alright to me. All-in-all, they are pretty good gloves for the money. If there was anything I would change, I would make the leather a bit thicker and the fingers shorter.Anyway, that's my initial reaction, I suppose only time will tell how they hold up...EDIT: After a few weeks of owning them, I haven't found anything wrong with the gloves. I love them! Although I have experienced the rough interior, it's not bad. I don't even have to wear wraps with them, they just scrape my skin a little and turn it red. I haven't bled or gotten cut from them so it's not as bad as some people have said. I also changed my mind about the fingers, I like their length. They cover well and provide good padding. All-in-all, I give these gloves 9/10."
322315,0,"I was very excited to get this for my Marlin 75 because it looked and felt like a toy in its old wooden stock. The package is very nice and it comes with some padding to put over the cheek rest and a non slip pad for the pistol grip. I was really disappointed in the quality. The seams needed to be sanded down. I think this may have popped out of the mold and be put in a box. Its made in USA but in a Chinese factory another worker could have sanded the seams for an extra 5 cents. The cutout for the iron sights is too small to have the metal bar that increases the hight on anything but as far forward as possible. The worst feature is definitely the pop on heat guard on the top. One of four latches wont pop in place so it seems like it is coming off and if you have a magnification scope on the riffle rails, you have to take it off to put the heat guard on. All in all, it is an ok stock but it still makes the gun look and feel like a toy and is terrible quality so you might keep your dignity and money and keep it looking like a normal .22"
38604,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed.

491085,0,"Topeak seems to try and get too nifty designing their bike accessories and they miss it on building rugged, practical, easy-to-use and reliable products. Very few directions came with the pump or are on the Topeak website so I was left foundering. Although the pump has some nice design touches, they don't make for a great pump (maybe I'll try Lezyne next time). The pump is cheaply made, comes with too many moving parts and is unwieldy to use.The gauge will only give you a ballpark reading, so you'll need another air gauge if you want to fill your tires to spec. It takes time and manual labor to switch from Schrader to Presta. Some pumps have a lever that does this. You need to remember to pull the valve/gauge assembly up from the hose (some hose is inside this assembly) or else you'll get a disturbing pop as you pump. The lever action to lock the valve/gauge assembly onto the tire stem is different from most pump manufacturers. You have to push the lever up and away from the hose and valve/gauge assembly to lock it onto the tire stem. When you remove the assembly from the stem you will have air loss because it is a clumsy process. The pump stand is cheap and seems it might break off easily. The pump mounting assemblies (for the bike frame) seem to be pretty effective.This pump works decently and it's better than no pump at all, but I would highly recommend getting a different pump."

125567,1,"--------------------Update: May 31, 2012--------------------After several months of casual riding, I felt the stock brakes were not up to the task.My first approach was to see if I could make the existing pads work better. I removed the pads and found slight glazing. I cleaned the rims and lightly sanded the pads with fine grit sandpaper to expose new brake material. The brakes worked better but the brakes were still not good enough.My second approach was to upgrade the brake pads. I ordered from Amazon Aztec2 padsAztec Aztec2 Bicycle Brake Pads (Threaded)and installed them on the front brakes. The upgraded pads made big different but the brakes were still not good enough. I have the Aztec2 pads on my mountain bike and they work great, so I determined that the brakes needed replacement.My third approach was to replace the linear brakes (v-brakes). I ordered from Amazon Shimano Acera BR-M422 brakesShimano Acera Mountain Bicycle V-Brake - BR-M422(I ordered black as they were less expensive and were Prime) and installed them on the front. The pads that come with the BR-M422 work very well so they did not need upgrading. The installation was easy. I took the Aztec2 pads from the front and put them on the back. The brakes are now sufficient.If you want real stopping power, I highly recommend upgrading the brakes, not just the pads. The cost of the Acera brakes is insignificant compared to the cost of the bike, and they are a huge improvement over the stock brake pads and brakes.P.S. If you buy the Acera BR-M422 brakes, you need to save the noodle sleeve from the stock brakes and use that sleeve on the Acera brakes. The metal sleeve on the Acera brakes is too narrow to fit around the end of the brake cable. Removing the sleeve is easy. Before installing the brakes, just pull the sleeve off of the noodle and with it will come the plastic noodle liner. Do the same on the Acera brake noodle. Swap the sleeves and insert the Acera plastic liner with the stock sleeve into the Acera noodle and you are good to go. I attached a picture to identify the metal sleeve.-----------------February 25, 2012-----------------I ordered mine from Amazon and it arrived one day later. This same model appears to be running on 6 years. Anyway, like others, my box came damaged. The bike had a few scratches on it but nothing serious, and no parts were missing or bent. Some basic repair skills are necessary to get it into optimal shape, or take it to a bike store for final assembly and tuning.The wheels are single wall aluminum, hubs are cup and cone. The front uses a 13 mm cone and the rear a 15 mm cone. The lock nut is 17 mm front and rear. I opened the hubs based on reviews that the bearings were dry, but I found them to be well greased.I removed the tires and inspected the spoke nipples, as other reviews claimed of flat tires. Some nipples were sharp, so to avoid future problems, I put down a layer of gorilla tape over the nipples and then put the factory rubber rim strip on top, and the wheels have held 75 psi for 36 hours. I replaced the stock tires with Slick City ST MTB to reduce rolling friction (these tires have a lower profile making the bike sit lower to the ground rendering the stock kickstand no longer usable).The wheels were essentially true. I put them on my truing attachment on my PRS-15 stand and they were good enough for government work. I was able to properly adjust the spacing on the brakes without the wheels rubbing on one side or the other.The bottom brackets are cup and cone as well, with a traditional 3 notch lock ring and an adjustable cup with 6 holes for a pin spanner. Given the hubs were properly greased, and I could see grease on the spindles, and that the cranks turned freely, I decided to hold off on opening or fine tuning the bottom brackets until a later date.The derailleurs are Shimano, which is a plus, as some big box bikes come with no name derailleurs. The rear was essentially adjusted, although I adjusted the B-tension to better clear the 34 tooth mega range gear. The front was not adjusted, but was relatively easy to get working. I can now shift easily into all gears.I took it for a test ride and it runs fine. For comparison purposes, my road bike is a 2004 Giant OCR Elite with 9 speed Ultegra, so I know what a decent bike rides like. The Kent is not a serious training or racing bike. It is a bike for leisurely rides, and should suit such a purpose just fine. As with all bikes, this bike will need periodic tuning depending upon riding frequency and conditions.Although the hubs and bottom brackets are cup and cone, that technology has been around for a long time, is still in use, has a long service life, and can easily be properly adjusted. The derailleurs are Shimano and can be properly adjusted. The brakes are liner pull ProMax and can easily be adjusted to work fine. Even though the parts used on this bike are cheap, they all represent technology that has been proven to work. No, it's not light, and it's not race or serious training worthy, but for your typical weekend rider, there is no reason this bike cannot provide many years of service if properly adjusted. Just my two cents. I will post some pictures. Thanks and happy riding."
426747,0,"These glasses are just ok. They seem to fit well and I don't really notice any sort of distortion. The problem is using them in combination with muff style hearing protection. By the end of a shooting session, the part of the frame that is behind your ears seem to really dig in. The frame also seems to keep the padding of the muffs off just enough to make them not as protective as they should be.Great for a back up pair or without muff style ear protection..."
119497,0,Purchased this watch because we had seen one similar in retail store and it did not require a battery - uses kinetic energy. Watch would stop and go at first but seems to be working o.k. now although it does lose time.

502434,1,This is a great product to have for a great deal/value. You can play several different games with different table tops. It contains a base and additional covers as to adapt to the game you want to play.
76860,1,"Most comfy, warmest, non-smelly, breathable layer I've ever worn. I love it so much, I bought all under layers from Icebreaker. Now I'm head to toe merino wool. I only wish I had a couple more in different colors so that I wasn't obviously wearing the same thing every time I go out.!"
38095,1,"Great vest for cool sunny days. Vest is a little on the thin side. It looks great and feels great. The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily. I would recommend this to a friend, but don't look for a whole lot of warmth from it."

423637,2,i just recieved this bike (the second time i ordered it) because i returned the first one because it was defective. BATTERY WILL NOT CHARGE! i now need to return this one for the same reason. does the RAZOR company make any bikes that WORK?? very poor quality control! and the worst part is my child who was dissapointed TWICE!!!!!!!!
505235,0,"Great workout and lots of fun. However, it killed my knees after only a few workouts. I had to return it to Beachbody. I think the workouts are good but I would get bored with this after awhile. I just need more variety. Just can't commit to the program as it is laid out. Too repetitive and jerky on my knees. Feel it's a bit overpriced for what it actually is. Any Jillian Michaels, Jari Love, Cindy Whitmarsh, etc. Workouts can accomplish everything you need all in 45 minutes without all the jerking on my knees. It would be fun to do occasionally though."
92621,0,"The machine is a good bang for the buck, but it's not the end all fitness machine. You have to ride the machine pretty rigorously to get a good workout and the back bearings tend to grind a bit. However, for $100 you can't really beat the price. I'd recommend it if you are looking for something cheap and/or have limited space."
409034,0,"Agree with the reviews on here about the ball being fairly sturdy and nice. The foot pump was fine and only took a minute to blow the ball up. However, while the packaging said 65cm (what I ordered), the ball inside was only 55cm. Amazon are exchanging at no charge, but it's a hassle and I can't be sure that the replacement will be the right size, since the issue is with the supplier's product packaging."
412660,0,"This was a very nice watch for the price that I paid for it. You'd think that it should have costed way more. I personally never used the timer/triathlon features of this watch so I can't say much about it.I am content with my purchase of this watch except that my analog hands suddenly stopped working after 3 years. This wasn't a huge issue for me as I could still use the digital aspect of the watch, but not having working analog hands bothers me because I really liked turning off the digital background and just using the watch hands to tell time."
231562,1,"product is of exceptional quality, fits well and the measurements listed on the site are accurate"
29337,0,"They feel like regular handballs but they are not lively at all. If you're used to the bounce of the red ace balls, you'll be disappointed with the ektelon balls. If you don't mind a less lively bounce, these balls will work fine."

175071,1,bright and clear. bought this for my AR... loved it so much I bought another for my son's. don't let the price point fool you! amazing scope!
7194,1,I have a closet with leggings from the best makers and these out-shine all of them. I love them so much that I've gone back three times and bought more. These go all the way to the ankle instead of 3 inches above. They're perfect!
179146,0,"I have used one for several months now and have purchased as gifts for friends. Recently I did have a problem with My Card shuffler, but upon calling the company a new one was sent out immediately with absolutely no hassle. Can't tell you how that rates your customer service to me! I have made sure that everyone I know knows of the good backing behind your product. Good Job!"
377090,0,"It is exactly what you should exect o bet i around 30 dollars.The bow itself is relatively tough, and well made. The arrows on the other hand are crap. They feel like they could fall apart atvany minute, and are barelybheld together with what looks like glue...I would suggets finding another option. Try something else."
312648,0,"Pants are of very good quality material. Sizes are much smaller then usual. I wear between a med and large, so I bought the larger size. Looked like size SMALL and felt like it too. Can't wear them and unable to return because they require tags attached and I took them off before trying clothes on."
373152,0,The pants are well made and warm to wear. Around the waist and ankles its nice and loose but around the hip and crotch area very tight. The pockets are right in the middle of my hips and because of tightness will be hard to use. Except for in that area they are comfortable to wear but unfortunately will not be ordering this sweatpant again cause of size issues. I did order a large and anything bigger and I would be swimming in them but they are just a bit to tight. Will stick with purchasing sweat pants at local stores from now on to assure comfort. Shipping from this company was fast and had no issues with them.
351838,2,"I have the mens model but wanted a second one for a friend so I ordered this. Nowhere in the description does it say it's a women's model. Functionally I'd give it 3-4 stars. The chest strap is a bit small and it doesn't pick up the monitor as consistantly as a Polar. I give it 2 stars for the poor description that fails to mention it's a women's model. But for the price, it's pretty good, and my mens model of the same type has lasted very well. Just make sure you're getting what you want, men's or ladies size."
481202,0,"These poles arrived very quickly and were as advertised. I have used trek poles for years in doing archaeology in the Flint Hills and I wanted poles to use for urban walks on concrete and asphalt. I got these poles because they were advertised as ""shock absorbing"". Maybe I should have done a little more research. Shock absorbing can barely be felt with the poles, which I have not tried out in the field yet. So the 3 star rating is less the capability of the poles as the description being less than I felt would have told me that when we talk about absorbing shock, we are talking about a ""give"" of 1.0 to 1.5 cm. These poles are a little heavier than my old ones so I'm not sure what my arms will feel like after a day in the field with them. I am sure they will give me the same service in the Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma that my old ones have done. For anyone who has not used trekking poles before, be sure and do your homework."
34839,2,"Do not buy this!! Within minutes of unboxing I hit the flash-hider on my desk and it broke off. The next day I dropped it down the front steps and the material around the barrel broke completely off. The plastic is way too brittle for regular use. To top it all off it jammed after 150 rounds. I cleared the jam and after that it STOPPED FIRING! I don't know how to fix it. My guess is the springs are of such poor quality the wore out. Spend the extra money on a brand name gun like a UTG, UHC, or CYMA that is not made in China."
81239,0,Item received was slightly broken from poor packaging or from carelessness from UPS (don't know which).Overall happy with item as I use it to store cards and think this product is one of the better protector of cards.
417016,2,"waste of money don't bother with it when you finally do manage to get it on the tire, the stupid thing doesn't pump complete piece of crap. Even 1 star is too good for this piece of crap"
299461,0,"We bought this product to use on our pontoon boat so that our 70-lb. labradoodle could get back on the boat after swimming. It works okay when there is someone at the foot of the ladder to guide her feet so that she doesn't slip off the side, but I tried to send her down it alone, and her foot slipped between the ladder and the boat so that she was hanging by one back leg. I recommend the product when there are two people to help guide the dog, but be aware that, for a large dog at least, there are some safety questions, since the ladder is quite narrow."
20790,2,where are the blankets?? never got them in the mail or it was stolen ;-( I have emailed the seller 3 times--nothing from them at all!!! Im not happy with the seller at all because they never responded...
351826,2,"The features for this heart rate monitor are great--the hourly chime, alarm, timer, chronometer, and of course the heart rate monitor transition well from workouts to just a great watch that keeps me on track.The huge problem is that the start button that helps to set up everything has begun to be rather unresponsive after only a week of use! I haven't exactly dunked the watch in a sink of water either, but for some reason the crispness of that button press is gone and now I have to try a few times whenever I want to get it to work.The heart rate sensor chest strap isn't too comfortable either, and it does take a little time with the manual to figure out. However, if it wasn't for the start button sticking, I'd still give this watch a good review simply because the features are great. Tighten up the quality control, and this WOULD be a great watch/heart monitor."
315662,2,"I placed my order and it was shipped on time however, UPS left it on my doorstep and someone took it. I contacted the seller, a week went by and I received no reply, so I filed a claim. After filling the claim, the seller contacted me and said they just received my email. They told me that if I dropped the claim, they would reship my order via US mail so it wouldnt be left on my doorstep again. I agreed and dropped the claim. A month went by, I never received my order and the seller never replied to any attempt I made at contacting them."

124389,1,"First, we bought one of the plastic bike horns for my 8-year-old's bike, and it broke the second day. She decided she wanted a bell instead and I chose this one. She LOVES it. The ring isn't annoying, and it fits securely on the handle. She also loves the graphics on the bell. Overall, very pleased with it!"
259521,0,My son recieved this as a gift for his 1st birthday - we had to put it up for about 6 mos as he was not ready for it. When he finally could ride it he continually got his leg stuck in the open part at the back of the seat. He's 2 now and plays with it only occasionally - but he rides his Little tykes bulldozer daily. He continues to occasionally get his leg stuck and my 1 year old niece also got her leg stuck in it last week. My son is tiny @ 3rd%.
287787,0,"I gave this product 3 stars for one reason: the color is NOT what I ordered. I ordered PURPLE; I received what looks like an odd navy blue. The whole purpose for ordering purple was to match a team uniform. Although the UA tag had a purple strip to indicate the shirt was purple, it was not. I'm guessing it was a factory second because of the color. I will choose another vendor -- UA directly -- to ensure I receive the color I expect."
445261,0,"Thought the description said open and close feature, but it opens and is difficult to close (so slipping into a building out of the rain is not an easy task). Also thought it would cover a larger area. It is just small enough to fit inside a backpack, or you can use the straps, so that's good. Haven't yet had the opportunity to test the wind resistance. I have confidence, though!"
249059,0,"Nicer than using paper plates. But if the plates/cups/bowls come anywhere near heat, they will melt all the way through--not the vintage-style tin cups of yore that I expected. Silverware in the roll-up thing is nice, but they're not very heavy duty. The set would've been much nicer if the whole thing came with a storage pack of some kind, not just the silverware. Also, the Coleman Nylon Utensil set which is a complementary product for this dining set is a complete waste of money...you can get utensils of equal quality from your local dollar store. As an alternative for dining while camping, I recommend the Light My Fire meal kits: http://www.amazon.com/Light-My-Fire-Outdoor-MealKit/dp/B0013L4EL6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=sporting-goods&qid=1287444026&sr=8-1."
443197,0,"The watch is pretty and it keeps time, but that is all that I can say for it. The band is stainless but the links are folded and not solid. The bracelet is also too short for a man of any size, leaving you with no adjustment. You are then soon looking for a bracelet at the local jewelry store, or Wal-Mart. This, then raises the price to a level making the watch no longer a bargain. The case was advertised as being stainless steel, but it is marked as having a ""stainless back"" which indicates to me a plated base metal case. True, the price was very attractive, but the price adjustment(new band)made this a not-so-good buy. I should have bought a better watch. It was too much trouble to return, so I gave it away.Too bad."
329253,0,"Well, it works but it's not the most convenient. See, it uses temperature to tell you the level (when propane is in use the bottle gets cold). It doesn't tell you the actual level but it will tell you whether the propane level is higher then where you place this thing.For example, you place this indicator just below the halfway point on a 20lb tank. Near the bottom. Until the propane gets that low, the indicator will say it's full. Only when you have used more then half will the indicator tell you how much is left.This pisser is you have to be using the propane for this to work. We use it for the propane bottle on our tent trailer. We use the propane only at night for the heater. So, I can only check the level at night, but that's my situation, yours might be different).Anyway, it works well enough and as long as I check it before heading to bed, I know whether to fill up the next day or not."
484228,2,"I ordered 2 pairs of these shorts and received 1 pair of shorts and 1 t-shirt instead. Not only was it the wrong item, it was the wrong size, and a less expensive item, so it forces me to take action in order to rectify the problem. To send a completely wrong item makes no sense to me."
320068,0,"This dvd does give a few different exercises appropriate for four different ages. I was hoping to see a classroom style dvd to see how to teach a class full of kids ages 5-12. I would have also loved a fun music cd that I could play in class to go along with the moves. Instead, I had to rely on my own knowledge of Pilates, and combine it with yoga poses, coming up with as many animal type moves as possible to create an hour class for my summer kids camp. We had fun. Still wish I had good music to play and more ideas. I got a couple of ideas but think I would have been better off buying the yoga abc dvd."

454251,0,"UPDATE - October 24th 2012I called Marmot to report the problem (see below) and they asked me to send back the jacket to them for inspection. Canada Marmot customer service is excellent.This jacket is lightweight and packable into its pocket. The price is good but you get what you pay for. In fact, water impregnates the jacket after an hour under a moderate rain. If you're looking for a ""true"" waterproof jacket for hiking/backpacking, don't buy this jacket. Instead buy a Gore-Tex jacket such as the Marmot Minimalist. (I have a Gore-Tex one which resisted against pouring rains during many long mountain hikes in Adirondack and Mont-Tremblant (Quebec, Canada))."
162114,0,"The music may be my favorite part. The exercises should be conducted privately otherwise you may feel like an idiot doing them. I think there is some value in this type of exercise if done quite religiously and it will certainly build endurance over the long run in that case. For those seeking a very gentle and somewhat aesthetic workout this may be just the ticket. For my money, its still Paul Gaudino all the way!"
505694,0,"Fit and finish were great. The only thing I didn't really like is the fabric was so thin it was almost see-through. I bought these in black and would definitely have to wear black underwear rather than white under these. Still debating as to whether I'll keep them. They are comfy in every other way, so I guess I will keep them to wear & wash and take the risk of having to discard them later. Because of the transparency, I cannot imagine how anyone could wear a color other than black with these and feel comfortable in them. The other factor in my decision to keep these is they were not made in China which were a factor for us as we do not want to support exploiting anyone via sweat shops (and avoiding Chinese factories which are notorious for horrible conditions is our clumsy attempt at trying to do what's right)."

I desired a large capcacity pressure cooker and this is a BIG pressure cooker. the only downside is storing the cooker when not in use. if you're on the fence..... buy one.

4437,0,"This trainer mostly does its job. My biggest complaints are that it is very noisy (which is annoying in an apartment building) and the resistance is not very strong (fine if you are going for an easy ride, but not quite enough if you are trying to do high intensity intervals). My roommate has the Cyclops Mag, which is both quieter and provides more resistance. For this reason, I usually end up borrowing hers. The bar mounted shifter only makes very slight changes in the resistance. If I was buying the trainer again, I'd save the $20 and buy theCycleOps Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer"

I waxed the string and the guide as advised but I only got about 3 dozen shots before the first string broke. The second string broke 2 strands after the first shot. I don't expect it to last as long as the first string. Between breaking arrows and breaking strings this is very expensive shot per dollar."
344383,0,"The sleeping bag is well made, and fairly light. It kept me warm at 30 degrees, and I am betting it would at twenty as well. It is also pretty roomy inside for a ""mummy"" bag.However, it is NOT for backpacking. If you are camping this will work great, but it's too big to fit into a frame pack."

276247,0,"First, I am shocked that no one mentioned the horrible smell of the plastic edge liner....three days of letting it it 'out-gas' and it is at least better, but a little dissapointing for a 'fitness' product. Second, the assembly was easy, BUT, you are advised to read the other reviewers feedback. Third, for the price, it's not bad, but the jump mat seems un-even and not as tight and springy as it should be, but over-all, for the price, or for little kids, I would say it was a good enough deal."
235959,0,this bike was delivered by ups. box was coming apart. i assume it was poor handling by ups. some assembly was required. reading assembly instructions it was noted to take bike to specialist for final adjustments. no where on ordering site was this stated. that added to the purchase price. would not order bike online again.

74885,0,Frisbee as expected but what was not expected was this is an old add and the dvd is no longer available. It was purchased as a birhtday presant for an 11year old and this was the reason that made me get this particular model.
382981,0,"It is cheap and will just about do the work if you are looking for something very very basic. You cannot changes the incline/resistance. No fancy gadgets/meters. Just a calorie , minutes, miles and time counter.I used it 10times in the past 6months...already the left handle keeps loosening up and I have to tighten it every minute or 2.A bolt came off the left step and the step shakes a bit.The resistance is adequate to get one started on an exercise regimen.Assembly was tricky even for my husband who is a DIY guy because the instructions are not good enough."

304457,2,"I am a skateboarder with 26+ years of harcore street, downhill, and skatepark experience.I do NOT recommend these pads. They are way overpriced and inferior when compared to Hillbilly Butt Pads.They are hot, do not breath well, only provide light padding, and are sized a bit small.Did I mention they are freakishly expensive for what feel like cheap economy pads?If you are a skateboarder or downhill rider, if you want better protection, better qualty build, and more affordable product get Hillbilly Butt Pads Instead. I was dissapointed with this purchase from the moment I opened the package through my test. In comparison the Hillbilly Butt Pads were impressive in every way including saving my Butt in a downhill skateboarding wreck.I should have returned these but ended up selling them to a Rodeo Clown instaead for $25. An expenive lesson that hopefully you will avoid.If you want tight, sweaty, pads that provide only slight padding on the hips then get these. If you want pads you feel protected in and that breathe and don't make you feel like you are wearing 1980's spandex and a girdle... Get Hillbilly."
323948,0,"Loved the monitor and used it at every workout. However, when the battery waned and I went to the retailer for replacement, I discovered it needed to be mailed in to Polar for servicing.

78728,2,"I purchased a white one and it looked great.However, the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and isn't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing. It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It's a nice brand, not worth the price and there are better ones out there."
394057,0,First of all let me say that this product does limit the ant and roach population in the home and it is great to use if you have pets and young children. Because of my dogs I was very concerned about using Raid so I opted for this product instead. And although I am somewhat satisfied with this product it does not work as good as Raid. It does NOT kill anything in seconds like advertised. I drowned an ant with this stuff and it was still crawling around for minutes afterwards and most likely would have stayed alive if I didn't kill it. The spray acts more like a barrier to keep the pests away but doesn't kill them. I used this product with a combination of Orange Guard (bought through the same company) and Orange Guard certianly works much better and is also healthy for pets and children.I still would recommend this product for those who have pets but I am purchasing Raid spray as well. I think it would be much better to use the Raid spray in areas that are not occupied by pets and children but use this and/or Orange guard in the more open areas of the house. Also open a window when using it the mint smell is great when used in moderation however you would more than likely want to spray your entire home and it can build up to an overpowering scent.
420802,0,"I've been carrying one on my key ring for years. Unfortunately, this handy little knife has an inexplicable design error: the attachment ring is at the ""wrong"" end. When the blade is open, my key ring attachment is in the middle of the opened knife, rather than at the end. This is not a problem with the scissors because they open out from the other end. However, since I use the blade about 99% of the time and the scissors about 1% of the time, the awkward placement of the ring is annoying in normal use. The other problem with this placement of the attachment ring is that the toothpick and the tweezers are more likely to slip out and get lost because they are hanging on the ""down"" side (mine disappeared long ago). If you look at many of the other Swiss Army brand knives that have an attachment ring, the connection point is in the ""correct"" place for easy use of the main blade. I still wouldn't part with mine, but I'm not happy that the design fights with the use of the tool."

431936,0,"I've long heard Safer Soap recommended as an insecticide that can be used on sensitive plants but which is also effective in controlling pests. And since I've started growing a vegetable garden again the last couple of years I was excited to see this product. Last year we had quite a problem with aphids and there aren't many options to control them that are both effective and safe - and that won't affect the taste of the vegetables. The product claims to be safe to use up to the ""day of harvest"" even though it takes 7 to 10 days to biodegrade.But this year has been cool and damp and I've hardly seen any aphids. There have been so few on my tomatoes that I can almost control them by hand. Nonetheless, I tried the Safer spray and they seemed to disappear - at least for a few days. The bigger problem this year has been caterpillars - they're heaviest in my lettuce and the mint. But after spraying both I see very little difference. In fact, I drenched one little caterpillar in the mint with no effect - even though the bottle says ""kills on contact"" - he was still alive the next day.On the plus side, it did seem to eliminate some slugs that were in my strawberries. And the only plant that seemed to react negatively (with slightly burned leaves) was parsley."

317411,0,"I chose this fanny/belt pack to replace a leather one from Wilson's, the zippers of which broke in just 18 months from the strain of what I stuffed that pack with. Time will tell if this pack suffers from the same problem.So far, the capacity is what I need, and the extra cell phone pocket is just dandy. I like that the nylon doesn't scuff the way the leather on my former pack did.But this thing is noisy. The heavy-duty zipper pull tabs clank with every stride. The manufacturer should have spend a few cents more per item and had rubber pull tabs put in. Also, the waist adjustment band has no neat way to terminate the free end. I ended up putting a rubber band on the inner strap, sort of like a belt loop for the outer strap.I'll come back in 18 months and update my rating for the product's longevity and value."
74930,0,"I've been searching for socks to run in ever since my normal running socks became more difficult to find. I really wanted to like these Wigwam socks and my first impression was that they were extremely comfortable. The first few runs that I did in them were fine but when I wore them during a 12-miler, I developed blisters on one of my toes. I tried them with a different pair of shoes and the same thing happened. I understand that sometimes blisters happen, although for me it's usually due to rain or 18 miles or some combination, but this seems to be a regular occurrence in these socks once I get over 6 miles.I'll continue to wear these socks for shorter runs (less than 6 miles) and to the gym since I do find them very comfortable but I'll skip them on the long run days."

203001,0,"Pros, Cons, and other thoughts:I've been hunting online for a good rowing machine for a couple of weeks by comparing features and prices. The only drawback to online shopping is the inability to acutally see and possibly try out the product before purchase. I'd originally thought about purchasing this product at a local retailer (Sears) for the ability to return the product in case of trouble, but they didn't allow in-store pickup and wanted to charge shipping on top of the listed price - so Amazon won my dollars with free shipping.The Good:The rower's main beam is a nice solid formed chunk of aluminum; hefty and well constructed. The assembly process only took 10 minutes, all tools necessary were provided and all parts were accounted for; it even incudes the batteries for the performance meter. The unit folds up very compactly for storage, and though it has a moderate weight to it, it isn't difficult to move about to get it out of the way. After assembly, it was ready to hop on and use. When on the rower, it is easy to adjust the ""difficulty"" during the workout with a simple twist of a selector on the ""shock absorber"" type hydraulic resistance device. The seat motion is fairly smooth and quiet using small versions of roller-blade type wheels; I appreciate the quiet part living in an apartment not wishing to raise the neighbor's ire with a grinding, squeaking rowing machine. The grips are comfortable and adequate.The Bad:Out of the box I'd already found minor cosmetic details that bothered me; The ""power bar"" attachment had been dropped on end at some point and had a small dent, the main beam part where the seat rollers go had a bent edge at the end - all cosmetic and not affecting performance and useability. The foam grips are of inexpensive material, I'd expect them to fail soon with a regular workout, so I'd plan on buying some bicycle handlebar replacement tape at some point during the machine's life. The seat is hard plastic, so if you're lacking in, shall we say, padding - you may want to find something to soften it up a bit. The locking mechanism that is used when the bars are swung out and locked for use is a pair of screws with large knobs that screw into the arms - the screws aren't long enough and have to be almost completely undone to lock the arms, sometimes they do come out and you have to re-insert them; not a terrible thing, just poor design. The action and length of the arms is not very well thought out either, I found myself knocking the ends of the arms which are made of hard plastic on my hands when I pulled forward (the part of rowing where you lift the oars out of the water); be careful or you could give yourself a nick.The worst part: One of the locking screws for the arms stripped almost immediately; not from over-tigtening on my part, I don't think it ever got tight. A little mechanical fix it on my part solved the problem; I filled the tube up the screw hole with solid epoxy and tapped out a new thread. In addition, the rubber bushings where the resistance device attaches and the arms attach squeak as loudly as a kindergarden class given half-inflated balloons to rub together; I do mean loud! Fix this by applying just a drop of liquid dish soap to each end of the bushing, don't use oil products - it may cause the rubber to degrade!Overall:You get what you pay for. I took the trouble to work the problems out myself because having to box everything back, get an RMA for returning the product and having to wait for a new one frustrates the heck out of me. This machine is one of the less expensive models, there are some rowers that cost over $1000, but for that much you can buy a compete home-gym weight machine if you have room for it. I'd probably get this rower again, it's cheaper than a subscription to a gym (even if it breaks after a year, you're probably still ahead) and I don't have to drive anywhere to use it.I'd give this product a *lower* rating due to the flaws, but the affordability keeps it at a 3 star rating."
276048,0,"The photograph and the description for the ""Body Solid GOBH5 5 Bar Olympic Bar Holder"" are incorrect. The base is 12x12"" - the bar holders themselves form an X - there are 2 up top, 1 in the middle, and 2 at the bottom. They are all the same height. There are 2 holes available to bolt it to the floor.The Amazon description of this item includes, ""supported by 2 extra heavy gauge diamond plate foot platform. 4"" thick dura foam padding plus three lockout positions for safety."" This is obviously incorrect. See the Body-Solid website for an accurate description, but the same inaccurate photograph.I'm generally happy with the product - I would have preferred the pictured layout in terms of the location of the holders and their height but the actual product isn't terrible, just less stable in my particular situation than the pictured one would have been."

156796,2,"I'm a big Victorinox fan and have owned about 10 other models. I've loved the design of them all. This model is the one exception.For the item I received, the can-opener/bottle-opener combo tool was very difficult to open and close. I actually cut my hand while closing it.Also, in my opinion, the knife is too thin for its length. This makes it difficult and uncomfortable to use. Please consider the Victorinox Swiss Army Classic SD (Silver Alox) or the Victorinox Swiss Army Cadet (Silver Alox) as alternatives.The Alox Clasic SD is just as thin; but because it is shorter, it is better proportioned. Also, the SD's scissors are very useful. The Cadet is a little thicker, which gives it better proportions. The Cadet is still slim enough though and it comes with more tools. All the tools on these knives where easy enough to open too. Both these tools are close in price to the Bantam too."

I figured my ears were uneven and its just something I will have to put up with. But, when I unfolded the glasses and sat them on a flat surface I noticed that they are slightly warped. The left ear piece is at least 1/8 inch off the surface. I don't know if this is within Persol's normal manufacturing standards or even if this is exactly what is causing the uncomfortable pressure on the right side. I have never had this issue with a pair of sunglasses before so I can't be certain."

Right now I'm wearing a Reebok 2X NY Giants T-shirt that's about 4 inches longer than this 3X Russell t-shirt and I've found this to be true of every Russell shirt I've ever purchased. I don't know what they use as a template, but all I can figure is that they use dwarves. Check out the model in the picture. The shirt is hanging below his crotch--when I wear it I look like Comic Book guy from the Simpsons.

For instance the XL in the jacket is a perfect fit for me, but in the vest I had to exchange the XL for a L ... The vest seems to run a size larger, and I think it would be a better design had they also included the bottom draw strings on the vest as they have on the jackets (being that the vests cost as much as the jackets) ... Had I been able to find a brown vest in the style of a black one I got from Land's End I would have returned this L also ... Bottom line for me Columbia Sportswear Jackets 5*'s, the best I can give this vest is 3*'s."

491292,0,"I recently purchased this bottle at a local health food store to replace my heavy glass bottles that I use for drinking water. Three negatives I've found with this bottle:1) I've heard that stainless steel is as light as plastic but I haven't found this to be the case. Stainless is safer than glass where breakage is concerned but not lighter when filled with liquid.2) The cap on the bottle is made of plastic and the inside threads of the bottle are stainless. Needless to say, they don't fit well together and so it leaks.3) The cap has a carabiner attached which makes it awkward to turn. It would be much easier if the carabiner and ring were attached to the bottle rather than the cap.Although stainless steel is an excellent alternative to plastic and safer than glass, I'm going to return this bottle and look for a different design."

Gripping it I could get a light layer, but not really any significant amount.I did empty the bag, crushed up the chalk even more and did find it worked a little better. But the results aren't particularly pleasing. It takes either tight gripping of the bag or to get better results: some sort of impact against my hand (ie throwing it) to get chalk up. Throwing it is less than ideal since I don't particularly enjoy breathing chalk.It does work it just doesn't work particularly well. I don't think I could recommend this to anyone."

But I'm really happy with how this watch looks. It is thinner than I expected (which I like...though it is not thin...9mm, yet is not bulky either) but it is elegant looking, yet informal enough.I like the fact that it winds itself up, I've wanted a Seiko kinetic for the longest time and this was the best price for a auto relay one $213! (it pauses itself when not used and then adjust itself when you start using it again).One thing I didn't like is that the calendar is on a montly bases only...so any month of 30 days or February...you have to manually adjust the date...I don't know if the more expensive verisons have a true year calendar built in...It is the heaviest watch I own, but is not enough to give you any problem. One thing you need to be aware of, the autorelay will adjust the time, but not the date, so if you don't use it often, you need to adjust the date and takes a while with the little dial if you are a few days off. In short, if you want an autorelay Seiko Kinetic, but want to do it on the cheap...this is the one to get, the only ones you'll find cheaper won't have the auto relay feature."

29011,0,"I got this lock almost a week ago in the mail. Firstly, it doesn't look much like the picture. It has a big gaudy yellow bar (not a big deal) and a bulky fixture to connect it to the included frame bracket (also no a big deal, it comes off). The frame bracket they include is worthless, the screw that connects the actual clip to the bracket snapped off the second time I tried using it. The lock itself works great, though it is a little big for my taste. With a faulty bracket, it's really a pain to carry it around unless I take a bag with me, which seems silly for just carrying a lock."

When the product arrived, it was not the specific shape I had been hoping to receive. However, there was never really a place to select the desired shape -- only the color and size. So, I relied on the picture, took my chance, and lost.

42597,0,"I like the wii program. The problem is the equipment. First, if you are any bigger than the lady on the box for the legl band or in the video that you can watch on Amazon, don't bother. You MUST fit the leg band above your thigh. I bought this Wii fit compatible because I am in the process of losing weight. Hello, My thigh is WAY too large for it. So pay attention to any specifications. It's NOT for people who are exercising for weight loss and have more than 40 lbs to lose. Also, the avatar is constantly getting stuck because it isn't reading my movements, which is really frustrating, and I'm sure it's because the leg band was only above my knee. Finally, the exercise band that came with the leg band is nowhere near stretchy enough. I'm just 5'3"", I had the band completely stretched out between my feet so as to leave the most stretch in the vertical sections. Even with that, I could barely raise my hands as high as my hips on the bicep curls. And, of course, the avatar kept getting stuck because I wasn't lifting my hands high enough. I didn't really need this band--I just wanted the leg thing, so I'm going to use my own exercise band next time.With all of that, if I can get it working better (I'm going to sew velcro onto the leg band to extend it until I lose more weight), it would be a really good workout. It's fun because it mixes things up alot. I'd rather play more exercise games than do all the strength training, but that's not a big issue. It could be better though."

196851,0,"I purchased this knife in a combo pack with the SOG Power Assist multi-tool from a national warehouse store chain's online site. The combo was offered at a good price for a US made full sized multi-tool and larger sized assisted opening pocket knife. Unfortunately, both items fell a bit short of my expectations and have been sent back under warranty. Mind you, these were sold as first quality, not factory seconds or refurbished. I've left a review for the Power Assist on it's applicable Amazon page.As for the Twitch XL, at first glance it appeared well made out of high quality materials. I have no complaints with the laminated construction, handle scales, or overall blade quality. Upon closer inspection, I noticed hairline cracks on the locking bar where the steel is bent to come together to form the area that you depress in order to unlock the blade from the open position. This is likely resultant from improper grain orientation during the forming process or insufficient annealing between forming stages. It may even be a design flaw in that the bend radius is too small for the particular alloy and gauge of metal. Regardless, it doesn't appear to be a fluke in one sample as the knife was replaced when sent for warranty repair (in part because of this flaw), and the replacement exhibited the same flaw.As delivered, this knife does not open easily or smoothly. Again, the knife was returned to SOG partially due to this issue, and a new sample was returned with the same issue. While possible to open using the ""flipper"" that protrudes from back of the handle when closed, opening using the thumb studs was next to impossible. Additionally, the first 15-20 degrees of blade travel felt very gritty. When the second sample came back unimproved, I took it upon myself to see what the issue was. It turned out that the camming surface in the notch near the ""flipper"" on the blade is not polished at the factory like the outer radius of the blade tang is. After disassembling the knife and using 2000 grit micromesh on this area and the bearing surface of the locking bar, the opening action improved significantly. I feel the geometry of the camming surface could be improved as well, but have not experimented with it.The blade lockup of the Twitch XL leaves a bit to be desired, and can not be easily improved. There is considerable side to side play at the blade pivot and tightening the pivot screw to achieve an acceptable level of play results in the blade not fully extending under the assisted opening force. Additionally, there is a bit of up and down motion of the blade when locked open. The notch polished to improve the opening is not the same notch that would effect this motion of the blade when open and locked. Inspection of the inner area of the locking bar which catches the notch of the blade revealed evidence of crude grinding, which I believe is contributing to the relatively loose lockup. Short of a new locking bar, there is no way to remedy this.There are several design considerations which I feel put the Twitch XL at a disadvantage to its competitors. First, the AUS 8 blade steel is adequate, but other manufacturers use arguably superior steels in their offerings at this size and price point. Second, SOG has included a safety lock which is easily inadvertantly engaged and not easily disabled without fully disassembling the knife. Given the high intitial force required to begin opening the knife due to the steep cam, this ""feature"" is arguably unecessary and likely added at the the behest of SOG's legal dept. Competing assisted opening folders in this size range either do not have a similar lock, or it is easily removed.If you are considering this knife, I would look closely at the Kershaw Blur line. It is similarly sized, uses the arguably better Sandvik 14C28N blade steel, is much smoother opening from the factory, has tighter blade lockup, made in the USA like the Twitch XL, and out of more than a few Kershaws that I've purchased, all have been flawless out of the box. Both SOG and Kershaw offer a lifetime warranty and lifetime sharpening, but SOG charges a $12 handling fee for their ""free"" sharpening, while Kershaw does not.I wanted to like the Twitch XL. I like the blade geometry and the understated look, but I just think it's outmatched by other offerings in this price range."

Maybe if it was set to more upbeat music I would have liked it more."
505068,0,"This is a perfectly good stopwatch - if all you want to do is note your finish time, or note 1/2 finish times. But, if you want to remember split times, you'd better have pen and paper handy. Once you restart the watch following a split, there is no way to cycle through and view the split times! So, if you're trying to time multiple swimmers/runners, or if you're trying to record 25/50 split times, this is not the watch for you. Again, no fault of the manufacturer or the reviews - I should have looked more closely at the functions."

195928,0,"The Coleman Tent Light is a great idea. This wedge-shaped light is backed with two powerful magnets and a removeable metal mounting plate. Take the mounting plate off, put the light wherever you want to in your tent, put the mounting plate on the outside of your tent behind the light and viola! You now have light, and it easily clicks on and off with one hand, which is important when camping. The magnets are strong enough to mount the light to either horizontal or verticle surfaces. It takes AA batteries and it's easy to get the unit apart to put the batteries in or replace them.In fact, it's too easy, and that is one of my complaints. The magnets are so poweful that pretty much anytime I take the mounting plate off, the light comes apart, too. I guess it's not that big a deal, but seems to me that it just could have been designed to avoid that. Things that continually fall apart have that ""cheap"" feel to them, and that's not what I want to feel when I'm in the middle of the woods. I want to have confidence in my gear!My second ""complaint"" is that the light is also not that bright. I put this in a four-person tent and it was just a little more dim than I would have preferred. It was certainly bright enough to see and get ready for sleep; this is not going to be a reading lamp, though.All-all-all, this is not a bad product and I'm happy I have it for the price at which it was sold. I just wonder if there maybe isn't something a little better out there."

254088,0,"I was under the impression that the Ab Lounge I purchased was BRAND NEW. This was not the impression I had when the product actually arrived. The hand bands at the top of the chair clearly had some wear on them, and although there were warning labels regarding product use adhered to the frame of the lounge, there was no instruction booklet included to advise about the use of the product. The only written instruction included in the packaging, at all, was what appeared to be a computer generated list about how to assemble the lounge. The lounge is not easily put away, either. It is cumbersome and takes up a good bit of room, making it difficult to refer to the lounge as &#34;convenient.&#34;"

Not that I know anyone who did that... The Deda-emblazoned black finishing tape you might as well use as decoration for your Trapper Keeper, because it sure doesn't do nearly the job of or look nearly as nice as a stretch electrical tape.

Last night, as I held it against a very strong storm, it didn't even flinch. And because the wind passes right through it, there is less tugging on it, so it feels lighter than other large umbrellas I've owned. I easily carried it with one hand in strong winds. When I went home after the worst of the rain had let up, the streets of New York were strewn with tattered and broken umbrella corpses. They were literally everywhere, more than I could count.

To be more precise, they are too small in the groin area. I noticed that since I got them that I am constantly pulling and readjusting.

229955,0,"I bought this kayak initially because I was concerned about storage space. Inflating it seemed pretty easy (maybe 10 minutes). The construction of the top half of the kayak seemed more durable than the bottom half, this concerned me. When it said the bottom was made of a PVC material, I was thinking ""ok, PVC pipes, those are sturdy, it'll be something like that."" Lol, I knew it had to fold, but I was expecting something thicker than an inner-tube. I would've been happier if the bottom was as thick as the top was. Deflating it is a major pain in the butt if you do not completely suck the air out. I found it unusually hard to prevent air from re-entering the chambers once I suck it all out. The military-style air locks are easy to figure out, but the locations are somewhat awkward to access. I spent 45 minutes trying to totally deflate the kayak so it fit in the carry bag just like I found it. If you are planning on keeping this kayak, I highly recommend you get/make a bigger storage bag. I just got frustrated with it, returned it, and bought a hard-shell kayak that same day. If you have patience and don't plan on encountering anything with sharp obstacles, this is the one for you. Advanced Elements has an amazing forum which I recommend checking out if you're having your doubts."
417255,2,"This trike looks very attractive and we were very excited when we assembled it. However,it was lot of trouble to assemble it. It took us lot of time to figure out how the handles get hooked onto the trike and that we would have to drill it.No other toy, that we have ever assembled required us to drill a hole to fit a screw and the instructions are not too great.Once assembled, the rolling part is fun and my son enjoyed it but when we took it out to ride, it was not much fun. My son was about 22 months when we took it out first and he was not very good with steering the bike or pedaling it. We thought it would be okay as it had a handle for us to push but it is not possible to steer it.That made it a pain to use this trike. For a young toddler, who does not understand steering its a waste unless you are going to wait until they are old enough to understand steering. By then i think they would know to pedal too, so the push trike does not make sense then.He is 24 months now and after taking this trike out a few times we got tired of it and sold it and bought a radio flyer trike and it is lot more comfortable to push and steer and is an awesome ride. I wish i had bought the radioflyer the first time itself. The fisher price one was waste of money."
287745,0,"The main problem with this rod is with the joint. They are not ground in for a close taper fit. The two wide joints on my example were wobbly and in danger of flying apart during a cast. I solved this problem by bedding in the joint with 600 grade valve grinding compound and beefing up the male end of one joint with a thin layer of epoxy, then gently grinding it in. Also the last tip end joint was not dead straight. I guess you get what you pay for."

How about the Jordan Roundball Classic (the shoes already in the game), or the Magic Roundball, or theIndiana/Kentucky High School Game?Sticking with this, in the summer how about the ABCD camp all star game so we can evaluate (it's possible, Reebok/Adidas is in the game also). How about the Indy Nike All-Am Camp? You know, make me feel my 60$ bought me something.Also, PLEASE bring back the recruiting map of NCAA Football/March Madness 06 for PS2. I like to break down by state, you know, not just a lumped list. That was plain lazy.I know this is a reach, but i'll ask anyway- How about some schools that AREN'T in a conference? like Independents! Can we have like 3 DII conferences? some JUCOs? Let's make it interesting... how about 10 or 15 of the storied High School (they already are all over CSTV and ESPN) like DeMatha, or Cthe King, or Lincoln, or Gary Roosevelt, or Oak Hill, or Mt. Zion, etc.Finally, I like hearing the announcers, but if you want to actually go the extra step, how about a pre/post game show. Not that nonsense you have now, i'm talking a real one. How about the option of watching a 30 second ESPN style update show every Sunday in dynasty. How about a good Preseason and Tourney selection show. Can we get a Midnight Madness?Obviously, we know what EA was looking at- THE FACE. But word of advice, just like it was a sinking ship on PS and PS2, its only a matter of time before people get hip to the fact you ignore THE SUBSTANCE."

427866,2,I purchased this bed in October and slept on it for 1 night. When I woke the next morning the bottom chamber had leaked a significant amount of air.I requested a replacement (which came the next day) and the same problem happened. It's obvious there is no quality control at this company
195812,0,"This Brewers lamp is hard to rate. I LOVE how it LOOKS, but the quality is just ok. It's a bit smaller than I pictured it would be. The lamp shade is connected to the base VERY poorly and after a few months the lamp shade already fell off, there is not a way to fix it, I'll have to take it in some where. So, because of the shade and having to deal with finding a place to fix it, I would have to say that I wouldn't have bought it (even though I still think it's the nicest looking one out there)."

151911,0,"I am moving my bike and needed this in a two day period. I ordered it Wednesday night and got the mount on Friday so that is good. I haven't installed it yet, but I am already disappointed. That is mostly directed to Amazon and how they have the page laid out. You see, I went to purchase the Yakima locking blockhead. On the page it has ""Select Size"" and has two sizes - 1) One Size and 2) 9x11.75x1. One size is $20 cheaper. That is apparently because it is not the locking blockhead but the regular. Now I either have to return it (but I have to have it tomorrow) or buy the locking spindle for 30$ and a lock for $20. So I am in for $25 more than if I had picked the right product.Shame on Amazon for having such a poorly designed page. I will be talking to customer service next."

Amazon have undertaken to amend this mistake.Apart from that the product itself is fantastic, very easy to use and install, however do not consider installing with out the locks"
148855,1,"Ordered the Thule Fit Kit for my 2000 Mercedes E430 Sport. Had a little trouble getting the kit installed w/ the Thule RB47 Rapid Aero Aluminum Roof Rack Load Bars and Thule 400XTR Aero Rapid Roof Rack Foot Pack, it was a bit of a struggle getting the screws locked in, since I was performing the install directly on the car roof. Once I took all the pieces off, connected the fit kit to the load bars and fit kit off of the car and then loaded all the pieces together it worked. I need to buy the Thule skirt so that it blocks out the wind noise while driving. While driving there are no issues - at around 75-80mph I had no issues."
208046,2,May be for footballs. Not great for bicycle pumping. Too small and that is why takes too much effort to pump even a small amount.
491607,0,"The watch and the data collection device operate independantly. This leads to the timings on the watch and the data collection device to be differant based on when you start and stop either device. It would be nice if I could get both units in synch. The software gives you a lot of data, but could be more flexable and intuitive. I'm finding the best way to manipulate the data is to copy it to XL. The heart monitor at times seems to be widely inaccurate. For example, it has shown my heart rate from time to time spiking to 240 bpm, which obviously is not right.It may seem that I'm negative about this product, but I am actually having fun with it. Except for the occasional inaccurate heart rate readings, the data is great. I have found the speed and distance numbers to be very accurate. And for the most part I am glad I purchased it."
131268,0,"These lugs crimp okay but no better than others and are not 100%. I had to crimp using the proper tool several times on one of the lugs out of four in order to get it to hold sufficiently.

120780,2,This brake lasted through 3 20 minute blading sessions in my neighborhood before wearing down to the screw. I think they have created a product that burns quickly in hopes to sell more. Don't waste your money!
336639,1,"This tee-shirt is my first Under Armour purchase, and I took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any Under Armour before. I'm not dissatisfied, but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt. On the positive side: the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the gym, and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures. The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag. On the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept. Also, the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect). A lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid. I prefer a true vee-neck. Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratchy feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics. It's not clear to me that the cost in ""hand"" is worth the added function of ""wicking"" in this instance. Overall, I consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour-long run, but I wouldn't want to spend a lot of extended time in it."
311668,1,"My kids take their goggles off about 10 times during a single swim lesson. I have no idea why. These goggles are easy to loosen to get the goggles on their head and then easily retighten after they're in position. The straps are very robust, and they can each have a different color."
405723,1,"I recently got back into cycling, and have been refurbishing my old Specialized Rockhopper for commuting and weekend rides. First issue, the old SRAM gripshifts had decayed and left a nasty residue on my hands, and my rear shifter had broken so it only would go between 3 gears. Looking online for a direct replacement, I found this on Amazon. They're cheap, they honestly look a bit cheap (plasticy), but they work great and are surprisingly solidly made. Easy to install (10 minutes work), my only criticism is that it would have been nice if they threw in a cable end to finish the installation job. Other than that, top notch for the part-time cyclist."
306648,2,"bought this treadmill in Nov 05, it had to be replaced within two weeks. New one stopped working Aug 1, 06 and still has not been fixed and it is almost three weeks later. I do get to talk with lots of people at tech support, Kari, Shawn, Keo and Kristin. All of them are really sorry about the fact that my treadmill does not work but, they are not able to figure out what is wrong with it and get it fixed. They sent me two different parts and two different service companies. Unfortunately neither one could fix my machine with the parts sent and both service companies complained to me about Horizon. So, if you are lonely and like to talk to nice people who are really sorry, buy this machine and you can talk to tech support for Horizon for days, weeks and I am sure longer. Machine looks nice, when it works it is ok. When it does not work, it makes you feel stupid for buying it."
289209,1,"I read the reviews for this product and decided to give it a shot. After using it, I can definitely say that it is excellent! My only complaint is that it fits extremely snug and you might have to work your ears into it. The band on the top isn't like headphones in that there is no adjustment for people with different sized heads. I can get sunglasses or safety glasses on with them but I don't think a hat would work. I suppose that it might be important for it to be very tight to ensure a snug fit to help dampen the noise. Be warned if you use these outside because they will make your head and ears sweat. If you want excellent hearing protection, these will fit the bill if you don't mind a tight fit."
419910,0,The only problem is I think they run just a little smaller than other athletic shorts in the size small.

460964,1,"I bought this Yoga ball for the main purpose of being my ""chair"" in the office. It works great! This 75cm size was perfect for me (height around 5'8""). Didn't deflate or have any odors, and if you like a more firm seat you can probably just pump more air into it with the provided hand pump that comes with it. I've been using it for about 2 months now and have not had any problems with it :)"
11663,0,"I really like Columbia Sportswear Jackets, so decided to try the vest ... The fabric is the same soft, warm, fleece as the jackets but the fit in the vest seems awkward ... For instance the XL in the jacket is a perfect fit for me, but in the vest I had to exchange the XL for a L ... The vest seems to run a size larger, and I think it would be a better design had they also included the bottom draw strings on the vest as they have on the jackets (being that the vests cost as much as the jackets) ... Had I been able to find a brown vest in the style of a black one I got from Land's End I would have returned this L also ... Bottom line for me Columbia Sportswear Jackets 5*'s, the best I can give this vest is 3*'s."
403626,0,"Pros: it's affordable, works great for travel to the range, has 3 places to use pad locks for security, and is lightweight.Cons: the plastic is not very thick, the shell barely holds my M&P; 15-22 with a scope (can't use with full size mag), i'll definitely have to remove the scope to fit another rifle, the latches are thin and the hinge is weak - it twists with ease.Summary: It works fine for light use but don't expect too much.Shipping: Fast and appropriate."
443093,2,The boots were very heavy duty and way to big. I would suggest sizing down. The would be a great outdoor work boot. Not just for the 'city'.
274952,1,This was a Christmas gift for my brother in law. He said it was soft and fit well. He said it did not shrink when washed.
143705,1,"Years ago, flint could be found anywhere. But when more and more people quit smoking, flint became much more difficult to find. Campers still use it, so it has become a camping supply no long found in drug stores. Flint does deteriorate, so if you have some laying around for many years, chances are you now have a small pile of powder. I found this flint at Amazon and quickly bought it for my camping supply box because at the time I wasn't sure when and where I would see it again. Quite frankly, I have not even opened the packet, nor will I until I actually need it. My advice? If you have camping equipment that still uses flint, buy your flint when you see it, not when you need it. Coghlan is a known brand and ten pieces will last a long time."
20850,1,I recently got some lego pneumatics in the mail from lego education and this storage container fit them perfectly. A little smaller than what they look like
248442,0,Bought for Christmas present. Not sure how it is going to fit or hold up. Cant review more until then.
125662,1,"The saddle bag is excellent quality. The pockets are 4 inches deep, 13 inches wide and 3 wide at the top and 9 inches wide at the bottom due to some angling so your heel won't catch on the bag. The straps that hold the bag to the rack tend to loosen a bit after a few rides, but are easy to tighten. I'm considering replacing them with velcro straps so I can remove and replace the bag more easily."
272401,0,"This is a good product and I only wish it also came in a ""wicking"" or moisture moving weave/style. I always buy Russell if it is available."

200631,1,"I really just needed an Autococker back but I saw this for a little bit more than just buying the back alone. It included an insert and a Freak front-end for just a few bucks more; so how could I go wrong? Well, the ""FREAK"" cutout lettering faces downward when it's screwed in. ... :(Not a big deal, the barrel fits and works great so it's really just a cosmetic issue."
55616,1,Sizing might be a little counter intuitive. A bigger girl might prefer a smaller or a smaller girl might prefer a larger. It's about the space between the legs to some extent. They wear nice for my girls.
374376,0,"I ordered this bike thinking that it had the Disney princesses on it, or something similar. Instead it has fairies. The name seems a little misleading. It was also hard to put together. The pedal assembly took over an hour to put together. My husband had to file the end of the medal rod that the pedal is supposed to fit on to. Overall, I do not regret ordering this bike. My daughter, who is 3, absolutely loves it. It was her favorite Christmas present."

443644,1,"Great build quality, easy to clean, and looks freaking cool. But for some reason the bottle I got couldn't keep it's coldness for more than an hour in 80 degree weather...maybe it was a ""defective"" bottle? lol. And yeah, I screwed the cap on that sucker pretty hard, so no possible leakage there...Seems like most other reviewers really enjoy the actual amazing insulation capabilities, guess I was cursed with a bad one! Someone enlighten me!"
283470,2,"I found the sizing to be quite different from the real Tokaido uniforms. Also, quality was noticeably lacking. A bit cheaper than the real ones. But I think people should be made aware of the fact that this is not a real made-in-Japan top-of-the-line Tokaido product. Not bad for a training uniform. But I wouldn't want to be seen at a grading, seminar or tournament with one of these..."

371394,1,"I have been using the road machine almost daily since getting it. It was super easy to set up, even though I did have to resort to the instructions to do it. I also had to get on the Internet to see how tight to place the roller against the rear wheel. Once all that was done it has been so easy to just go down to the basement and get on the trainer for a good 45 minute workout. Since I don't have to spend the time to get to my ride area and back I have cut twenty minutes or more from my workout time. Of course with the trainer the weather is no longer an issue and in new England where I live that is saying something. I have been using my training time to listen to lectures on my iphone so I really look forward to my training time.Great road feel and a quality trainer for a reasonable price, what more can you want?"
254538,0,Got this watch for Christmas of 08 and love the look of the watch. I like heavy set watches; watches you know will take a licking and keep on ticking. So I was disappointed with this one because of how light it really is but I hope that it holds up. The watch has a great movement and awesome highlights with the 24K gold on the bezel.Over all a nice watch that I hope will last me a very long time. We will see.

67766,1,"First off, I'm not sure why everyone is talking about hitting tree's with this. The only reason to hit a tree with a sword is for conditioning of your palms and getting your wrists accustomed to the shock factor. Even that would only last a short time.Anyway the reason this PRODUCT is a five is because it is worth the amount. (It would be much more accurate to call it a short sword, the product description clears states that it is only just over two feet long.) Obviously it doesn't compare to handmade katanas, but few ""swords"" under twenty dollars outlast anything other than sitting on a wall. Hence the higher rating.Yes, the sheath is not well made. The tip is actually quite sharp and will tear holes in it.No, it is not ""razor sharp"". People need to realize that all generic factory swords come with a knife style edge. That's not how a sword edge was designed to be. Long story short; YOU WILL NEVER FIND A SWORD THAT IS ""RAZOR SHARP"" THAT ISN'T TRADITIONALLY HANDMADE AND SHARPENED. And those cost hundreds at the very cheapest.Someone stated it's too thin or light to do any damage in a fight and you would be better off with a pocket knife or your fists or some such nonsense. This is ridiculous American rationalized bull. Many Chinese swords are thiner, lighter and more flexible than this product. If that says nothing to you, I've proved my point.This is obviously not a short sword made for sword snobs, but it's totally acceptable for the price and bloody rad for fantasy fanatics. The end."

453170,0,"I love the step because I can use it on any exercise I choose to do on my own but I was very disappointed at the dvd that came with it. The dvd was not wrapped in the plastic wrap at all and whenever I placed it in the dvd player it constantly freezes and skips throughout the entire program. I haven't made it all the way through the entire dvd because it freezes so bad. I would love to be able to do the exercise that go a long with the step, which is one reason I purchased the step, but the cd quality is very poor. I wouldn't recommend to anyone and would not purchase from here again."

376682,0,I bought this because my car has a GPS device to record where I go. The device is on all the time. When it is cold my battery would be dead on Monday morning from no driving during the weekend. This did not solve my problem. I do not fault the product.

340521,2,"I was so excited by the reviews that I read on this product that I ordered two and eagerly awaited their arrival. Once I received my shipment, I immediately followed the instructions and set up everything according to the instructions. The next morning I put the pedometer in my pocket and started my day. I checked it periodically and it was registering more steps than I knew I had taken. The ultimate straw was when I logged several hundred steps while driving a short distance in my car.I promptly requested a return label and sent them both back. Fortunately, I only opened one, so I will get full credit for one, but who knows what I'll get back on the second one since the package was opened. Of course I am also out the shipping costs. I expected more."
456222,0,"I like gadgets. This is a good gadget for a family with a tent, or for a family that picnics. When filled with water, though, this is heavy. You wouldn't hike anywhere with this. When tenting, I didn't want to wash my hands under the water spigot at the tent site. My feet got wet and sometimes muddy. That's why I got this sink. This sink is an outdoor sink. It drains right out of the bottom onto the picnic table. To solve the problem with opening the sink without pulling the top and bottom apart: the best way to open the sink is to turn it around so that the hinge is against your belly and open it. The top and bottom will stay together. Another issue is that the holes for the toothbrushes are small. Nowadays toothbrushes are so ergonomical and thick. You might have to stay aware about which toothbrush to buy and bring with you."
468645,0,"This is a well made holster.... for the range. It fits nicely on a belt but if you want to have a fast draw this is not the type of holster you want. When you go to draw the gun out the holster comes up with it. It does not have something to hold down the holster itself. I receantly took it to the range and in order to pull the gun out I had to use two hands. It fits nice and snug just like advertised with an ajustment screw. I thought that I must be doing something wrong because the holster kept coming up(so I read the instructions that comes on the package it was shipped in, I know who reads instructions for a holster right?)the instructions were for a paddle holster and not for the belt holster, so for the range I think it will do the job if you dont mind holding it down while you draw.For the price I guess you really cant complain after all you get what you pay for right!"
429158,1,"A friend showed me this stick. I played with it for about 5 minutes, doubting that it could have any beneficial effect w/o lots of reading of the manual, and even then, doubted that it could do me any good. I've had what feels like knots in my leg, and manual stretching of many styles has done nothing to relive the tightness and pain.The Stick Sprinter, I am pleased and suprised to report, immediately fixed the taught muscles I've lived with for about a year now. Seriously.As you roll the Stick over your ""challenged"" area, you can feel it pin-point the knots or spots that are needing relaxing.. and as the photo-manual says, ""it doesn't have to hurt to help"". I found that the ""sore spots"" were 1) discovered by the Stick to be specific spots; and 2) Rolling over them gently but firmly with the Stick felt good, and 3) It allowed me full movement of my leg all within the first 5 minutes of using this product. Amazing.I always look to Amazon for my purchases first - no hassle returns is a biggie should I need, pronto shipping, and the best tracking info out there. It's all good."

It took 4 months (and many follow-ups and empty promises) to finally get the upper computer wire. And if that wasn't bad enough, the console still doesn't work properly. No input is registered, as such, it turns itself off after 2 minutes regardless of continuous peddling. I've been thinking about writing a book entitled the ""2 Minute Workout"" to try and recover the money I wasted on this product."

However, the next time I buy a pair of biker shorts, I will look for a pair with even more seat padding since on longer rides, the bike seat still can become uncomfortable."

473075,1,"These are great for a complete home workout. I order Red, Blue and Purple.I go to the Gym too. Days when I don't have time for Gym, or I'm Traveling, I use these for my workout and get a good pump.Items were delivered fast and in great Condition. Would Definitely recommend.Stay Fit!! Stay Alive!!"

275640,2,I am hear to warn you that you should not purchase this product. I saw some negative entries but decided to buy the sauna suit anyway. I ordered a 2XL and when I received the product is was labeled M/L for medium/large...clearly was not going to fit me. Besides the size issue...this product is not something I would have wanted anyway. The material was very thick and not made of the type of material that I was used to with similar products over the years. Don't buy this!!
67795,0,"I bought this sword a year ago, I haven't really used it for anything but a wall decoration, But it's a good piece of steel for the money. It is a bit thin, but i've owned machete's that were just as thin and were expected to do heavy field work(chopping brush and so forth.) After a good sharpening this would be a forminable blade."
222166,1,"I bought 3 of these and not for tackle. I use them to organize my picture hanging hooks, furniture repair items and I just bought one for my mom to organize her beads and other jewlery making items. They are handy, light, and perfect for organizing any small items."
347746,0,"The chips are acceptable for the price.Pros:1) Price. And the set works well for home games.2) Lots of extra stuff: 4 decks of cards, dealer button, lots of other buttons, key chains, etc.Cons:1) The case is pretty flimsy; I doubt it will last very long.2) A high percentage of the chips (probably 30% or so) have off-centered stickers, which are easily peeled off (not from normal use, however).3) When you first open the set, the chips are covered in black powdery stuff.All in all, a good deal for the price, but I'm not going to make gifts of this product."
447183,0,"... because you have to learn all about them to get it working.Shipping was fairly fast, taking a couple weeks to get to my semi-minor town.Firstly I notice the tires were twisted funny on the wheels. Very cheap. I had to adjust the tires to get everything roughly symmetrical while gradually putting air in. This took half an hour.From here I followed the instructions and put on the front tire, seat and handlebars. No problems here. Took another half hour because I'd never done it before. Well, just be sure to tighten the handlebars REALLY well. I fell the first rut I hit because I lost my steering.The next unofficial thing needed is truing the wheels while gradually tightening the brakes. The included instructions make no mention of how to do this, and you'll have to find out via google. I found it's important to adjust the brakes while truing, or else you'll go nuts trying to figure out why the brakes don't work right. I lost probably 3 hours on this.Next goes on to derailleur adjustment... this is where my nightmare truly began. The instructions tell you what to do, but leave out a critical step: NOTICE THE ORIENTATION OF THE ADJUSTMENT WIRES AND FLIP THEM AROUND AS NECESSARY TO MAKE SHIFTING EASIER!! I found I couldn't operate the front shifter at all with all the strength I had. Then I just unbolted the adjustment wire and spun it around the other way on the bolt. Suddenly shifting took less than half the oomph of before! Too bad the derailleur actually BENT in this experience. I torqued the shifter so hard it ripped and bent a metal part. I emailled the company and they got me a new one in a couple weeks.Then I realized I couldn't install the new derailleur without using a chain tool to temporarily break the chain -- a tool I did not have. So I ordered a $20 tool to do the job. That was another week of delay. I think I spent upwards of 8 hours just on the derailleurs.So over approximately 5 weeks and 12 hours of active effort, I now have a finished bicycle I don't really trust so much. If I hit a bump or shift gears fast, the chain pops right off. But hey, at least it was cheap and looks nice. I do like the shock system too -- it is a fairly cushioned ride."
303909,1,"My family and I used these cleats all this lastwinter (winter of 2009-2010). We got an enormousamout of snow this last winter and these cleatsallowed us to keep walking on trails near ourhouse all winter. Even though, we typicallywalked an hour a day on mixed packed snow, iceand rock, the cleats show no wear.Pros: Work great on packed snow and some ice.Cons: If you walk mostly on ice, you may wantsomething with more metal on the bottom."

31048,1,"I can use the blanket anywhere, everywhere! It's very soft and nice to use. It folds very nicely and can be very compact. It's a waterproof, so even if the ground is wet, you won't be wet at all. The blanket is also very durable and can take some heavy beating. I love this blanket!"

104917,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
296291,0,"I ordered this bike for my 8 yr. old daughter. She likes the colors. Unfortunately, it arrived without a bike seat. We had to order another bike just to get the seat. Fortunately, Amazon paid for the return shipping. It seems a bit heavy for a small childs bike. The gears are hard to turn for my daughter. However, she loves riding her new bike."
306716,1,I purchased the Tachikara SV5W Gold because I wanted a high quality volleyball for indoor competition and I had good experience with this brand in the past. Two panels started peeling off the volleyball the second time it was used. I contacted Amazon and they replaced it immediately. So far the new one has displayed the quality I would expect from the SV5W Gold.
83237,0,"So don't get me wrong, it works and tells you where north is. But...It's not the same Lensatic compass I used in the military. Remember, the product has the word ""Style"" in its title. I use it to find my bearing when I'm under thick canopy and it does the trick. However, just small little things make it not the real deal. For example, closing the sight arm does not lock the compass.I ended up giving it to my boys to play with when they play army in the woods."

233440,0,"After all of the knives I have purchased which were made in China, I felt guilty and started a desperate search for an affordable knife made in the USA. I found this one and bought it for $15. I liked its looks and read many positive reviews. I bought this months ago and am disappointed.Pros*Looks cool *Big and strong blade *Came razor sharp *Secure lockup *Big thumbstud *Featherweight * Made in the USA - Counts for a lot, especially to a knife collectorCons* Handle flexes inwards - It has gotten to the point where the blade rubs against one of the sides of the handle* Jimping is, mostly, useless *Handle offers little traction - I had to add grip tape to it *Pin construction offered me no way of adjusting blade opening and closing * Knife is difficult to open - If you do not get it right on the first try, the knife closes itself. Even for a lockback one handed opening knife, this is unacceptable.*The pocket clip sucks - I have, almost, lost this knife multiple times, because it has come loose from my belt, or pants.The final problem with this knife: There are a tremendous number of Chinese, or Taiwanese, knives in the same price range which are a lot better. Try Kershaw, Kabar, Spyderco, CRKT, Boker, etc. Also, on Amazon.com, you can find great deals on more expensive knives made in the USA - Save your money and buy a knife which is truly reflective of USA quality."
341509,0,"I ordered the sock standard delivery to Hawaii and it arrived very quickly (Thanks!) For the price I must agree that it gets the job done, so I'm keeping it. Good thing because there was no receipt included in box. However, I expected a sock with assorted blue stripes, but received a sock in a solid deep teal ( thank goodness I like teal). My board is 9' x 23"", so I ordered the 9'6"" sock just to be safe. Glad I did, because despite the stretch the sock just barely closed over my tail.In closing, I recommend this product, and thank the sellers for speedy service, but suggest you provide a bit more product description (color, dimensions for length and width) on your amazon page."
407758,1,This is a real good ramp. I just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll-in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air! Overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major. It is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time. They are fun and you will have hours of fun!!! :):):)
79951,0,"Having studied the pictures closely, and visited the manufacturer's web site, I thought for sure that this unit would be the kind that has a spring trap (?), like the paperboys of yore would use to secure their newspapers.I was disappointed to find out when it arrived that this isn't the case; it's basically just a big solid frame.Will say, however, that it's well-built and fit amazingly well into existing threaded holes in my 15+ year old Bianchi Main Street.Major peeve - unlike anything purchased from Ikea or most other ""user-friendly"" vendors, this inexplicably does NOT come with the hex wrench that you'll need to assemble it, and good luck finding one in your local hardware store.But once you get it put together, maybe using a set of vise grips instead of the missing hex wrench, it fits the bill, as long as you pick up some short bungee cords to secure your cargo."
282903,2,"This replacement pump hose is indeed twenty inches long, and that's its finest feature. The chuck is flimsy, with plastic internals and thumb lock that don't promise a long life. Air leaked when I got past twenty PSI. This might work for inflatable balls, but as a bicycle pump hose it's a losing proposition. Spend more for a better product."
496841,0,"I can't write a review...I haven't used it yet..but instructions for inflating, and the pump worked very well!!"

156749,0,"I got the abs ball tonight and I'm very excited to use it for some variety (I usually do straight abs DVDs with no equipment). However, the free DVD is terrible:- the advanced routine feels like you're doing something, but the beginner one is a joke, so there's ultimately only 1 10-minute routine I can use with this ball. For $40 I would prefer to have a few routines I could alternate- hopefully they'll make a second DVD... (and the beginner/advanced routines repeat many of the exercises so I can't mix and match)- the guy leading the routine WOULD NOT SHUT UP. It's good to give information for beginners who might not know about back safety and that it's okay to start with fewer reps, but it interferred and drove me nuts: I frequently found myself waiting for him to finish talking so we could begin the exercise"
242650,0,"When these breeches arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the fit was pretty good. I'm only 4'11"" and the 28's weren't too long and didn't bag too much in the knees (common when you're shorter with breeches!). However, after riding in them a bit, I wish they had a bit more give in the fabric to conform to my body. Once on my horse, I had to really pull on them to adjust the legs upward for a comfortable ride. I just didn't get enough give in the crotch to make them comfy enough, though I think they fit well when standing! Perhaps I just need to break these in more, but I'll have to wait for the cool weather as the synthetic full seat is also a bit sweat inducing. Granted I rode in an indoor arena, when it was probably over 85, but I don't have as much of a pooling sweat issue in my seat when I wear a cotton breech. I think with a bit more riding time in these and cooler weather, they'll be good though. They seem extremely well made so could stand up to some washing for a more worn feel. Then, these will probably be among my favorites for cool weather riding!"
302196,0,The aft edge of the flusher allows water to escape but it seems to be fine. Not a bad product but they should figure out how to adjust how the fittings fit onto the motor.
108544,0,"I purchased this vest based on the prior reviews it had received. I agree with these other reviews, the vest is very light weight, it dries very quickly and the pockets are well placed. There were two complaints about this vest in prior reviews, the velcro and the zippers. I have not experienced any problems with the velcro yet although I have been using it for almost a month now (6 or 7 days of fishing). The zippers on the large pockets are difficult to use. They are small, they do not open or close easily, especially with one hand. In addition, the opening for those large pockets is so large that if your not paying attention when you open the zipper, you could easily lose all of the contents in the pocket because it will open up completely."
250350,0,"I like the simplicity of the screws, but this thing couldn't take a hard hit without breaking; too brittle. It would make a decent replacement, but if you can get a metal one, I would suggest that. They're sometimes listed only a few bucks more, so why not?"
481852,1,"We bought this little tank to use with a 5 Hp outboard on our Coleman Scanoe. The compact size is a plus. The tank is high quality material. We like the fuel guage, which seems accurate. The reduction in weight, too, from carrying a smaller tank is a plus as well!If you're looking for a small, well-made, space-saving fuel tank, this is the one for you. We really like it and would highly recommend."
485878,1,"I bought this replace another air bed and was pleasantly surprised with the quality. This inflated quickly and seems very durable, I have used camping twice and once at home for guest. This bed loses less air after a night sleeps then similar beds that I have had."
18491,0,"This looks real good, feels reel good, but there are some loose threads that seem to me will lead to it self-destructing prematurely. More comfortable than some other brands though."
399702,0,"I wanted to buy a good recurve bow that was affordable but also decent quality. I was getting frustrated because the only recurve bows I could find at stores were the pathetic youth set ones. Apparently adults only prefer compound bows. I bought the Titan because it was a practical size and most importantly, fairly priced. The only real complaint I have is that when I strung up the two bows i bought, the top loop didn't rest evenly along the top groove. I can't tell if it has been effecting my aim or not. All I can say is that when I shot a different recurve bow I was hitting the bulls eye consistently. It's still good for the price."
381668,1,Most accurate pedometer I have run across. Easy to program and use. I would highly recommend the Omron HJ-720ITC.
491931,1,These leggings are nice and pretty good quality. They are not see-through unless you buy them too small. Mine fit perfectly. The legs are a little long (and I'm 5'8) but I like them that way. Good quality. Really like them.
282955,0,"First off, this does work to protect against mosquitoes. But it does have pretty big holes, big enough to let in some of the smaller insects. It is super light-weight compared to other headnets that I have (which is good because I am ultralight camping), but beware of its limitations."
75921,2,"For a $30.00 slipper, one would expect better quality. The upper portion of the slipper was excellent but the sole of the slipper was made out of a cloth type material that immediately wore out in a fully carpeted home. If you want a slipper that will last you a couple of weeks it's great but don't expect a season keeping your feet warm."

255245,0,"I was hoping this product would work a bit better for skidding, but it really didn't. It is sorta of cumbersome on your mat for yoga I have found. The other side is nice for pilates though and nice and compact to bring to the gym to lay down to protect yourself from other people's germs."
77321,2,I ordered Dr. Sears e-book a ton of years ago and have followed the exercise recommendations...they are great. I was excited to see this whole system launched and ordered it from the pace express website not realizing it was offered through Amazon. I am still waiting for them to ship it. My first email inquiry went un-answered and my second email got a response from customer service saying they were still waiting for product from the manufacturer but would mark my inquiry and order urgent. Who cares!? If you don't have product something should go up on the site saying there has been a delay. Instead it still says your order will be processed in two or three business days and you should get it in 10 business days. What a crock! This might be a great product but how would I know?

325554,1,"The product is OK. If you do not have bike-balance expertisse do not try it. I had to use sand-paper for the left edge of the seat because it was rubbing my leg. Said, not mayor issues at all, when getting less than 30 miles. The feeling and good vibrations while having your little one riding with you with four hands on the handle bar are the best!"
175822,0,Im a Seiko collector this is my 6th. Well Im sure the movement will perform just fine for many years to come but the watchdoes not look as good as in pictures and some materials seems a little cheap. Overall a fine timepiece for the price butis the least loved seiko in my collection.
173065,0,"Not as sturdy as advertised. Did not last a year before in broke under heavy rain and wind. Searching for a replacement. Under light to medium rain, it is good golf umbrella for the money. It may not hold up in a heavy storm."

434611,0,"I received this table as a housewarming gift. I found it to be a lot of fun. An important thing about foosball is that you really need 4 players at any time to have fun with it, 2 just doesnt work out.I like the way it is designed, the movement, the shape of the players. I wish it was more sturdy though, I might do some reinforcing."
473534,2,Very disappointing! Spend your money somewhere else. I threw away a perfectly good but old made in the USA Thermos bottle and bought this made in China Nissan 0.79-Quart Stainless-Steel INSULATED Bottle back in June of 2005. Ten Months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it - evidence of the loss of its insulating function. I think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which I think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside. When you spend $25 one would think it's a good quality product - Think again!
288939,2,This did not fit me well but I think it is my build - short and dumpty. I loved the color and material but it was too tight!
493445,0,Good price but I won't to see more colors If you did I will buy more
493519,1,"This is a great entry-level atomic/solar watch that is made to withstand a lot of punishment. The watch is pretty self-sufficient once set correctly it will update itself nightly. Wonderfully priced and it shipped from Amazon immediately. Things to consider...1)the hands are a bit small and take some getting use to but should not be a deterrent. 2)The back light is just that...a back light. Its a nice blue color that highlights the dial allowing you to view the contrasting hands. It does not illuminate the digital displays. 3)You have to set your home time, then the hands for the watch to function correctly. The manual makes it sound like you simply set the digital portion and boom, but this is not the case. You set the home time, advance the hands to match the home time...then boom. Once set...your done. The atomic time will update everything, even the hands during DST! 4)Its big which is good and bad. Good that it looks big and tough, but bad when you try to button a shirt or wear a sweater. I don't mind, but someone may.The instruction say that you have to keep it near a window every night to receive a signal, but I've worn the watch to bed under a pillow and it still found the Ft. Collins tower. Oh yea..5)It only receives one signal from Ft. Collins, Co. You really don't need the other towers/signals unless you're an international man of mystery and hopping the globe.I'd recommend this watch for someone geared towards the Analog look while wanting some digital functions and durability.Cheers,"
223972,0,good quality and function for the price but it is a small brick. It weighs 152 grams per my wife'e kitchen scale. That is a lot more than the advertised 124 grams. It is also large. Keep that in mind if looking at this for size/weight. My Topeak Toolbar does almost as much but is smaller and lighter.
332543,2,"Not sure what everyone else is getting, but the sword I got today looked nothing like the pictures posted by the vendor. I cannot believe that in this day and age people still try to get away with this. I will be returning promptly.Major difference: the most beautifing aspect of what is pictured, the handle. In the picture you see a beautiful carved handle with sail ship.What you get: is a handle with nothing more than a tin piece of metal as the hand covering. Think of the letter P with sword tip pointing downwards. That all you get!"
450385,1,"I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out. I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym. It is very tight, so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product. As far as sizing, I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5'10 and 180 pounds. I bought the large and it works great."
159893,1,"Since purchasing my first Victorinox knife last year, I've become a big fan. In fact I've now purchased 10 different models. Of these the Explorer Plus is one of my favorites (along w/ the Deluxe Tinker and Swiss Champ). The fit and finish on Victorinox knives is excellent, and they are durable, useful tools. IMO the Explorer Plus has a very useful tool set, and is still easily pocketable. I particularly like the in line Phillips driver, and the magnifying glass. Also, I highly recommend the ""Plus"" scales over the regular Explorer model (which adds a straight pin, a very useful ball point pen, and a mini eye glass screwdriver to the usual tweezers, and toothpick. I've found these items more useful than I would have imagined. The 4 layer SAKs are hard to beat if you're looking for a useful pocket tool that doesn't cause your pants to droop."
440010,0,"I purchased this hoping it'd fit the 5 gallon bucket I had like the packet said it would. The material was too big - there's a way to cinch it but the material is still quite loose around the bucket; I wanted to pull the material up and around the bucket vs where the material currently hits, which is on the ground. The whole point was to keep things on or in the bucket, not dragging or scraping the ice. I fear the material will wear out too soon being dragged like that. I'm going to have to purchase something similar at a hardware store."
53166,2,"I bought this to hold some photo equipment, including some small light stands that are 21"" long but they don't fit.

I see now there's another review that mentions that it's not 24"" but I missed it before buying mine.It seems like a really nice bag with some good features and would have been perfect for my needs if it was just a little bit longer."

I've down-graded this to three stars.I'm now adding my third review and I've further down-graded it to two stars.I bot the User Manual on line, OK, but after reading its 20 pages, I still don't know how to get into this machine.I've now spent hours trying to understand how to adjust and use this machine and didn't get to even try it until my chiropractor came and made adjustments for me.OK, it worked for me, but my wife got into it and decided it was not for her.My chiropractor is a personal friend and he will be coming to the house to help set up my device and show me how to use it. He came.If you get one, I would suggest you be sure someone demonstrates it to you and you try it out with someone watching. I wouldn't try to use it without a helper. Critically important.I've not used mine yet, it will be a few weeks before my Chiropractor visits and can help me. I may try by myself, but cautiously. I tried before he came, managed to invert to vertical, shouldn't have done that and will never again. I learned how to attach the restraining strap. I suspect that the neighbor who GAVE hers to me, never learned enough on how to use it and gave up.I had help bringing the heavy thing upstairs, but could not find a model number to order a new owner's manual from the web address that takes care of this for the out of business manufacturer in China.My present feeling is that you shouldn't buy one of these if the manufacturer is out of business. Good service and support are vital for a device like this.I finally looked at images until in Google I found one that looks like mine, saw its model number and will buy that.I will give my credit card but sure wish Amazon offered the manual for safe purchase. The web site charged $4.95 for an immediate PDF download and I risked getting the Model 75112, hope it's OK. If it's not the cost is low.When I got this free, the neighbor had the manual but couldn't find it, so I have the inversion table, Life Gear, couldn't find the model number on it. She never gave me the manual, but I bought one, impossible to truly understand.My doctor recommended that both me (80 years) and my wife (75) use one and to buy it on Craig's List. I found many on Craig's list at $50 to more, but the free one was next door.We've both lost inches of height with age, hope this helps stretch.I rocked back and forth in this for 10 minutes, no difficulty. I had no feeling that I was different. I'll keep trying for some weeks and probably quit using it, give it to another...Karl Loren"

I gave it the 4 star rating because the zippers on all windows and doors have nothing to be caught on, and the material on the zippers (for waterproofing)on the fly itself have hook-and-loop fasteners. Good size for 2, 3 is cozy. I am highly impressed with the fly...if installed properly, a downpour won't penetrate it. This tent is a very sturdy package...save for the stakes."

57637,0,"I own a martial arts studio and we love these bags. They are about as tall as a man, so they are great for a martial arts workout. Unfortunately, you hit them hard enough for enough times and the screw from the top section will break - and then it's garbage. (The top section screws into the base. The screw is hard plastic and goes through the length of the padding.) They will take a lot of abuse before that. We've been buying these for 3 years. We've bought 12 total and have 5 dead ones (which work pretty well for back hand spring spotters when laid on their sides). What kills them is repeatedly kicking them hard enough that they tip over. Specifically, 160 - 200 lb brown or black belt doing flying side or front kicks with a lot of snap force 25 times will probably kill this bag. Now I know this kills the bag, but let's face it - those are fun kicks and the students love getting their kicks strong enough to knock the bag over. So, we're moving to hanging bags for that drill because it's getting too expensive to replace this bag."
94232,2,"I can not comment about the watch because the watch I recd. looked as if someone used it for a good period of time and then returned to Amazon. The box it was sitting in was also not like fresh looking, my heart broke to see the condition of the watch and the box and even though I had liked the picture and features of the watch but I could not keep it in the way I recd. it, hence I returned the watch by next post.

84390,0,"I wasn't to excited about the idea of having to wear a chest strap just to record my heart rate. So when I came upon the Mio it sounded like the one for me. I basically just wanted to know that I was in my target heart rate zone when I was walking/running on the treadmill or doing a workout video. I didn't want to spend to much because I wasn't a hard core athlete or anything!But what I have found out... was that the Mio works well if you are standing still. Even a slow walk on the treadmill can mess up a reading, and by the time you wait for the 8 to 10 seconds to give you a reading your heart rate has already dropped about 5 points at least. Also, I really wanted the calories burned feature but if your not checking your heart rate every few minutes then you don't get an accurate assesment of your workout. Oh! and it's very chunky in size.I now have a polar heart rate monitor and I will have to say... it was worth the extra money and the heart rate strap isn't as bad as I once thought. I have the F11 which has the newer soft strap. But you can by the newer strap for any of the models I believe. I have heard the F6 are where they made a lot of improvements.But my suggestion is spend the little extra and go with a more accurate one. My choice was Polar."

85461,0,"I take about one 3 week packpack trip a year. I recently used this for a 3 week stint in SE Asia. It was actually a little bigger than I'd like but it was rather inexpensive for the type of backpack so I gave it a try. Unless you are going to a cold place, you shouldn't need more than 55L. My friend bought the Teton 55L off Amazon and I rather liked it, so I'm buying that one next. I was going to originally get that but Amazon's prices seem to change quite a bit on these backpacks. One week it was $49, next $79, next $69.PROS:-It's big. I went there using only about 60% of the capacity. I ended up buying a lot more stuff than I usually do just because I knew I had the space.-The materials are very good quality. For the price, I was very surprised. I'd guess it would be around $100-$150 if I saw it in the store for the first time.-Sleeping bag compartment, pretty easy access.CONS:-It's HEAVY. I would put it at 6 pounds empty. I was rather irritated when I picked it up. It's the heaviest backpack I've ever picked up.-The design is really poor. The number of straps and plastic snaps is beyond insane. Not only that, most of the straps are over twice the length you need it to be, even for a large person. There are several I had no clue what they did, like the bottom ones. There are both loops and straps on the bottom of it for an unknown reason. This all adds a ton of weight. In fact, I spent about 3 hours clipping off all the straps and buckles I didn't need or figure out what the purpose was. I also removed the huge, oversized hip pads/straps. I then used industrial glue to redo the straps. I removed nearly 3 pounds from it.-The 10+ refers to the top being used as a hip bag, there's a rather large, heavy buckle in the top part that you use to strap around your waist. Not only is it awkward to wear, it's the dorkiest looking thing. I'd put it on par with duct-tape and a large zip-lock freezer baggie.-Water bottle holders are too short, my water kept falling out. I ended up just carrying it in my hand.-The rain cover in the top is pointless to me. more weight I got rid of. It'd help if you are in a downpour but who treks when it's raining that heavy. Maybe if you're in the woods and can't get decent shelter...or you want to use it to make a temp shelter... For light rain, the material is semi-water resistant. I just sprayed some water-proofer on it before I left and voila, zero weight water resistant.-The side pockets are useless. I like the ones that actually are compartments. These are just folds that expand out. I could only stick a couple folded shirts in them.-Material is high quality, however it's also very heavy again adding to the weight-The top is only held on by plastic buckles, the kind that easily come un-done when check-in'd at the airport. I used metals clasps to secure them for flight. If they come undone, I could easily imagine your contents being dumped all over the tarmac.-The main compartment's height/width ratio is not good. It's basically a long slender tube. It'd be better to have the widget and depth increased and have it a few inches shorter like most others.-The main straps that go over the shoulder, which supports the entire bag are nearly ripped apart and I didn't have much weight in it. It can easily be fixed with 'gorilla glue' which I used on other parts as well. There's only a line of stitching on each strap supporting the entire weight. For the most critical, stressed stitch...spend the extra penny to make it more secure.SUMMARY:Good for the price. I might suggest it if you are mountain backpacking and are more interested in getting something decent for a cheap price but for backpack traveling, there are a lot better options, even in the $50-$100 range."

163564,2,"I bought Kryptonite Evolution lock 6 months ago, and have only used it twice. The lock mechanism, which is apparently cheap, has jammed in the locked position. In this day and age when you just expect things that are much more complex than a simple lock will work reliably, this is just cheap quality. Definitely avoid this product.11/26/12 update: after going to the company's website and reading the troubleshooting section, I was able to fix the problem by inserting a small screwdriver into the keyslot and jiggling to straighten out the tumblers. Since then I've had no problems with the lock after 6 months of use. Seems like a quality control oversite at the factory, but OK once corrected."

100720,0,"I felt this was a great lower body workout, but I struggled with the abs section the first few times around and the arms section is impossibly hard to follow; so I normally just stick to the lower body part of this workout. Doing only the lower portion takes about 30 minutes, Tracey seems to do equal reps on each leg and she gives decent cues. The abs section she is not as even with and not as good with explaining and cuing. The arms section doesn't use weights, I know it would be difficult for her to cue this but it's not easy to follow at all, the camera changes angles and I'm pretty sure even does slow motion for a moment. The arms segment on her mat workout DVD are much easier to follow, I thought the arms on this DVD would be similar but I was wrong. Overall it's a great butt/thigh workout, but for the price paid compared to the cost of other workout DVDs I gave it 3 stars."

292403,2,"I just received my Klean Kanteen - probably the 15th I have purchased. I own a couple, and have given many as gifts. But alas, the company has done a bait & switch with the caps. What happened to the stainless steel caps??? They used to come standard. The whole idea was to have the internal part of the screw top to be steel, like the inside of the bottle - so there's no plastic touching your liquid. The exterior grip on the lid was always plastic - that's fine. But now, you have to buy the original stainless screw cap, as an accessory, that costs more than 1/3 as much as the entire bottle product. This bottle if great, but now go buy the staibless steel cap for $5.45.Shame on you Klean Kanteen."

It's the perfect size for his hand, and has excellent weight and rigidity.Problem is, the locking mechanism spring is so stiff, he can't push the lever to close it. Even if his fingers were a bit stronger, it's very unsafe to be using so much force to release the blade. Nice small knife for an adult, but not for a boy."
208408,0,"I bought this rack from Target without doing any research on it, primarily because this was the only 2-bike trunk rack Target had in stock and it was more convenient to go there than to Wal-Mart, who seems to only stock Bell brand racks. I will also say that I have 3 challenges in finding a bike rack: my car is (1)a hatchback with (2)a spoiler and (3)my bike is a mountain bike and therefore relatively heavy.Setting up was fairly straightforward, though the included instructions do leave a bit to be desired. My car was listed as compatible, though it was suggested I get longer (I think it was) S-straps, presumably so the rack could hook onto my car at the seam near the roof where the hatchback opens. It was when I came online to look for these straps that I found all the poor reviews here on Amazon. As the main reason I was getting a bike rack in the first place was so I could transport my bike for a cross-country move, I was discouraged by the number of reviews that didn't have optimism for its stability on long-distance, high-speed trips... nervous enough that I've now returned the rack to Target.I only used this Schwinn rack once for a very short trip up the interstate to a park. My bike stayed on the rack, and indeed seemed fairly stable on the return trip when I switched which direction my bike was pointing. However, like many others here, I noticed the bottom straps that clip under the bottom edge of the trunk (towards the license plate) to not be very stable. When pulling out from a gas station, I hit a bump in the pavement at a low speed that was still enough to shift them. When I would be putting the rack on the car, even, they'd come easily unhooked, no matter how much I tugged at them. (And yes, I did loop the strap back through the third slot in the clasp as depicted in the manual after tightening.)Perhaps it would have been fine; perhaps not. However, waiting to see if my bike goes flying off on an interstate, miles away from home, into traffic is not a test I wanted to put the rack through.I haven't tested the Bell rack I purchased yet, but I used a borrowed one to transport my bike the first time and it made the trip from Texas to New York just fine (save for a little paint rubbed off my spoiler). The two frames have similar construction, but the Bell rack has velcro straps to wrap onto the bike frame whereas the Schwinn has weird plastic straps whose holes clip onto 4 pegs. Disclaimer: For both racks, when I used them, I had the rear straps hooked to the sides of my trunk, which I'm sure is less stable than if I'd been able to attach them near the hatchback hinge. Like I said, I had no big problems with either, BUT in light of the reviews here, I have decided to stick with the brand I've already successfully tested."
243997,1,This particular item over all feels good. it's wide enough for someone who is overweight like me. The sleeves are pretty long.

494270,0,"Ok, I've had this knife for a little over a month now and have come to see it as a decent, inexpensive, light utility knife.I say light utility because I'm not too happy with the quality of the steel. After only a handful of openings the clip ad effectively etched the paint off the intersecting surface of the blade as well as taken some of the metal with it leaving the knife a little loose on the lock up.I don't carry this knife at all but I do leave it in my toolbox for the aforementioned light work. If you need something that will stand up to abuse pay a little more and either get one of the Dozier folders or go a little pricier and snag the Spyderco Tenacious."
218013,0,I recently purchased this Basketball System and in the process of putting it together (which isn't too difficult) I had left the backboard laying on the grass for 2 hours in 90 degree heat. When it was time to attach the backboard on the pole I realized that it was warped! After examining the thickness of the polycarbonate I was very disappointed to see that it was extremely thin. I haven't taken any shots on the backboard yet but I don't anticipate that it will be very solid. The good news is Spalding Cust. Service was extremely accomodating and is sending a new backboard at no expense to me (which is why I am giving it 3 stars vs. 1). This system will be fine for children (ages 4-12) but I do not expect that it will perform well under higher level play. If I were to do it over again I would spend significantly less or significantly more depending on the anticipated use.

331787,0,"I've had several Eureka tents & usually I've very happy with them, but this one is a disappointment. Even tho the 11mm poles seem sturdy, during a stiff wind on the first time we used it, the poles all splintered, one breaking off completely in the ferrul. And all of the metal sleeves bent. I've used other Eureka tents in higher winds & downpours & never had this problem!The offset door is a pain to use, reaching the zipper while the fly is on is akward. The weather was very hot during the day & the ventilation was poor, making the tent a sauna! At night it was chilly. The use of the gear loft eliminated the valuable headroom.On a positive note it showed no signs of leaking, but this is pretty well expected with Eureka. The door mat is a nice feature, but needs to be staked down adding something else to trip over. Comes with decent tent stakes, but I always bring extras anyway.For the money it's a decent tent, but having to buy all new poles for it after just one use makes it not such a great deal afterall.

64074,2,"I bought this bolster and as soon as I purchased it I washed the cover on delicate, in cold water and hung it to dry. Once it dried, I was not able to fit the cover back over the bolster. The customer service rep told me I should have dry cleaned it. For a Yoga product, and a natural, washable fabric such as cotton, I find this completely ludicrous. Washing in water is nontoxic, inexpensive and natural. Dry cleaning is expensive, uses chemicals and is toxic. I have many couch and chair cushiions that I wash regularly. Being able to easily clean a product such as this is important. The company should prewash the fabric before constructing the covers so that they dont' shrink. The label says cold water wash is ok, but it's not. There isn't any reason that the cover shouldn't be washable. I would not buy this product again and wasted $60."
47755,2,"I bought this mat for general home workout use, and used it once at a hot yoga studio.The ridges in the material cause it to keep its shape when you keep it rolled up, but unless you own a home (I don't) you generally don't have the space to keep it rolled out all the time. It sticks to my gym shoes and my hands, and the smell when you first get it is pretty strong. It was a nightmare trying to clean the sweat off of it from the hot yoga session too (I probably should have brought a beach towel for the top though)If you're looking for a mat to keep rolled out all the time and for weightlifting it works but for other purposes it's not quite right."

99690,1,I bought this bike on Amazon. It arrived earlier than promised and it took me all of 90 minutes to assemble it. If I do it again it will probably take me 20 minutes. The assembly instructions are not great but you can mostly figure out what to do from the instructions. The bike is simply great to ride. I have put on about 200 miles on it by now and have not had any trouble. I live in an area of lot of hills and this bike is great for climbing. The only thing I have needed so far is air pump.I had read reviews that complained about blown tires etc. but I have not seen any of that so far. It is possible that the company has fixed these problems since they were reported. Overall this bike is excellent value and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a bike to ride on weekends. This is of course not in the same class as a $3000 road bike however if you are newbie to road bikes (like me!) you would not know the difference.A few tweaks that may help. I had to adjust the front brake since it was barely working when I assembled the bike. The handlebar does not have enough space for a speedometer. I ended up mounting it on top of the brake cables. You may run into similar problem for mounting a light in front. I ride only during day so reflectors are good enough for me. I did not find it necessary to get the bike tuned; it works just great as it is.Overall a good value.

I purchased the Baby Boa for when I didn't want to carry a knife, it is so tiny it will fit in the watch pocket of your jeans without even noticing. It is a very high quality blade, sharp as hell, and the looks are great. I also love the flipper action, and the authoritative ""click"" that it makes when it locks open. Very solidly built, with a nice pocket clip. Or, you can be discreet and just throw it in your pocket and it takes up no more space/weight than a couple of quarters.Obviously doesn't take the place of a larger blade, but if you don't want to carry a large one, you can bring this along and be fine.Buy it, you won't be disappointed. You will be surprised at how small it is, but it does the trick. The tiny knife you DO carry, is better than the large one that sits at home."

236152,0,"I have owned Keys Fitness tradmills for almost 8 years. The first one finally broke electronically late last year after 7 years of great service. It was smooth running and I used it almost daily.This newer model I bought as a reconditioned unit (discount price) when Keys sent me the wrong part for my old unit. They told me they'd credit the earlier part and sell me this one for [...]. It was a good deal for the features of this unit, but I already have a new problem with it.The belt on this unit has gradually torn such that I have lost about an inch-and-a-half from the right side and 3/4 inch from the left. It makes a thunk when I walk and run on it and has minor slippage. It also makes a squeak when I run on it (sounds like the frame is not as sturdy as my first treadmill. Now, this may be due to it being reconditioned. Maybe when you buy it new these issues don't exist. I would say for the list price I see on Amazon you should get a lot better than this or you should keep looking.And I have to say Keys service is not what it used to be. Phone lines are always busy, they don't do what they say, and they make mistakes that shouldn't be made by professional organizations. I think my next treadmill won't be a Keys.As for the treadmill features, the left holder is not deep enough and is square. Only my cell phone and smaller remotes fit there. The right side is very deep and very wide in diameter (for drinks). Rather than use the program functions I stick with raising and lowering the speed and incline myself since the programs go at very slow speeds and you end up adjusting them anyway. The belt is plenty wide and long enough, but the plastic guards don't fit well and sometimes rub on the belt.Also, note that the magazine rack is way too high. I have to cock the treadmill at an angle from the TV in order to see the TV screen. And the heart rate handles definitely get slick quickly so always keep a towel handy."

295324,0,"I am very fussy when it comes to watches.I really liked the color scheme on the orange chrono and in reality it is just as it looks online.The watch is lovely and has a good weight but I just don't understand how the strap gets dirty so fast.This is really irritating and I'd have considered differently about buying it had i known that the strap would start to lookdirty after 20 min wear. (and that's in the office with a suit on, not outdoor work).if anyone can recommend an effective method of cleaning the strap that would be a good start.great watch, but the strap is a real downside."

92260,0,"i'm usually on the elliptical at the gym 3-4 times a week. i bought the gazelle for days i can't get to the gym. the infomercials made this machine to be top notch, but i have a few person comments about it:1. it's not a great cardio machine. i use it for 40 minutes each segment and only end up with 2 drops of sweat on my face. i think i sweat more doing sit-ups, so this really doesn't get the heart pumping.2.it has no resistance. unlike the ellipticals at the gym, you can't adjust the resistance. it's fixed on one setting, and it takes next to no effort to glide. this is a huge reason why i don't break a sweat.3. if you lean forward and backward on it, you get a mini arm workout. however, you have to really lean in or tilt back to feel something. for this, i like how this machine can work your upper body at the same time.4. in all fairness, this machine is able to stretch some muscles that ellipticals at the gym can't. i feel slight soreness at the backs of my legs the day after.bottom line: if all you want is something to get your body moving while watching tv, the gazelle is good for that. however, don't expect to get much of a cardio workout. if i had to do it all over, i'd invest the money on somthing that has resistance."

268718,1,"A Mongoose is NOT always the 1500 to 3500 dollar bike that we adore. Recently I bought a mongoose for under 200 bucks. It came with what I call cheap wheels and tires very similar to those found on cheaper bikes..When you pay under 200 bucks you can't expect to get the stainless spokes and an almost perfectly tuned bike. I am guessing but I believe most of the cheaper Mongoose bikes may have some generic parts. For example my tires look like cheap 10-15 dollar tires. They are stamped with the load range at 198 Lbs.. HOWEVER, for a low priced bike I am HAPPY with mine and the tires are holding up well. I had to tune the bike and will soon take it apart and grease the bearings and cables. Both derailleurs front and back were not set correctly and she shifted like a dog. The front tire wobbled so badly it would rub on the brake shoe with each revolution and setting the hand brake was almost impossible. I fixed it by simply truing the wheel using a small wrench on the spokes and adjusting the derailleurs. This is easily done. I simply loosen the spoke that pulls the tire off to the side and tighten the two on the opposite side. I make small adjustments at a time until she is fixed.. I tuned the bike and now I LOVE her. Mine has 27 speeds.. I am 62 years old and still buff. I weigh just over 200 lbs. In granny gear this bike pulls hills very slowly and yes it takes some getting used to.. If you tune this bike and take care of it I believe you will get your money's worth unless you end up with a real lemon. It's best to consider what you want this bike to do before you buy. I tool around on the farm on mine and ride trails up to 3 or 4 miles a day just for exercise. If you want professional, pay out the yang, yang..If you want a bike to enjoy in your leisure time then this baby may work for you and save you big bucks too."

472924,0,"The bands are high quality, but they don't provide quite as much resistance as I'd expected. I used them twice and then switched to a much sturdier band. These say they are for fit women, but they do not provide the resistance this ""semi-fit"" woman requires. The over-the-door attachment has a very small stopper. The second time I used the band, the attachment flew out of a closet door and the band hit me in the chest. It was a very painful reminder to make sure that it is secure every time. Be careful using the attachment on any door that does not have a very tight fit. Otherwise, I am very pleased!"

141167,0,"I mounted this on the bar of my recumbent. After gluing a convex mirror to the surface of the supplied flat plain mirror for wide angle viewing. I was surprised this did not come with a wide angle mirror which I thought was totally standard for bicycles. Had to use a rubber shim to increase the bar diameter for the c-clamp mount to work right. And yes, a lock washer/nut is needed.The basic design of the mirror is exactly what I needed, so the mods were worth the trouble. There is minimal vibration on rough surfaces, a major plus.3 stars 'cause of the flat plain mirror."

99426,1,"I became interested in competing in a triathlon, so I started shopping at the local bike shops for a decent entry-level bike. The cheapest ones were still over $400!! So, when I saw this bike on Amazon on sale for $89.99 with FREE shipping I couldn't resist. I had myself measured at the local bike shop to make sure I was getting the correct size and style of bike I wanted.I don't have much to add to the other comments, but I did want to say that the bike wasn't too difficult to assemble (it helps to have someone knowledgeable about bikes to help), and it's a very smooth ride. I was lucky in that there weren't problems with any of the parts. When I called Kent to ask what size allen wrenches I should use, they answered my questions with no problems.The purpose of this bike, for me, is to figure out if I'm really interested in becoming more serious in road biking. This bike is an excellent way to try it out, without breaking the bank."

333718,2,"After reading the reviews and the websites dedicated to this product I decided to buy 25 sheets. I have a hot dog vending company and figured it would be a great way to save on my daily cost of ice for my carts. After using the product for three months I can honestly say that it is not nearly as incredible as the sites and some reviews claim it to be. The sheets are no better than your average ice-pack. As a matter of fact, I don't think they last as long! I have frozen these sheets for weeks at a time and then place them in my coolers, sometimes WITH ice and within a day they are compltetely thawed and warm. Oh, and something that no one mentions before you buy them is that they ""sweat"" some kind of a slimy liquid as they thaw. Most likely some of whatever the chemical is that's supposed to keep it cold. My wife can't stand touching them and we both agree that we've wasted our money. I truly believe that the reviews stating how ""incredible"" this product is have been written by Techni-Ice employees or sellers.Bottom line is, if you want to keep some of your food in a cooler cold for a day or so, then Techni-Ice is okay. If your expectations go beyond that, look elsewhere."

Non need the 7,9,11 pounds.The main difference after 3 days practices on 3 pounds, is I can now control my little finger, while it was hard to control before.----One more comment after a month.After a month, I upgrade to practice the 9 pounds, which is heavy tension. I feel great when I play my guitar. Like money, you will never feel it's enough. :) I would draw back my previous comment that no need 7,9,11 pounds. I will recommend get full set the Gripmaster."
425725,0,"After using a friends pair of hand warmers on a cold day I decided to buy some of my own. I took a chance with these hand warmers and they work okay... but don't expect too great of a warmth. Like all hand warmers, they take some time to warm up to the warm temperatures they're known for. Shake it up and let it get exposed to the air. For best results you should keep it in your pockets so you wont loose any heat to the cold. Bring it out for some air and shake it a bit more once in a while. Overall it a decent product... gets the job somewhat done but still leaves your yearning for more."

501412,0,"So, I initially tried these out in a light drizzle/misty fog situation, and they were great. Reasonably sturdy, seemingly waterproof, and at least somewhat breathable. But on a hiking trip in Mt. Rainier National Park, where we were in a steady downpour for the entire day in a rainforest, they did nothing. I'm guessing that the overall moisture in the environment managed to soak up through the bottom or down from my jacket. This wouldn't be so bad (none of my gear maintained waterproof standards, so I'm guessing it's just not possible in those conditions), except that once wet through, these take FOREVER to dry. As in, they took two full days in a hotel room with the heat turned on full blast, and were still slightly damp.I can forgive them for not holding up in downpour conditions, but three days' drying time for something you can't put in the dryer or even too near a heat source is excessive. Also, they're cut somewhat oddly; they say they leave room for pants, which they do, especially if your pants (or hips) balloon out around your low-hip/high-thigh area (mine don't, really...), but the bottom cuffs are too small to get them on over your boots without taking off your boots, so that's not very helpful."

27409,1,"You cant go wrong with Chucks. I have been wearing them for the passed year out here in Afghanistan. They hold up nicely in the rough terrain and keep my feet cool during the summer months when the temperature reaches 130 F degrees. When I am back in the states, I wear pencil skirts and pumps to the office but I will never outgrow Chucks. I wear them on the weekends during coffee runs or for grocery shopping."
264220,0,"I purchased two pair of these to replace two existing pairs that I had purchased a hundred years ago. I actually thought I was getting the same pant but the material in these is NOT the same jersey knit I was expecting. These are more an ultra thin knit (if a knit at all) and, while the original pants were lightweight, which I liked, these are thin to the point of worrying me that they won't last a year.I'll have to see how these wear to decide if I would buy them again."
194015,1,"When I started getting rather largely pregnant, I needed something to improve my grip while doing prenatal yoga. Because I live in Miami, Florida, and it's humid here all year 'round, mats do not work for yoga unless the space is heavily air conditioned. Even towels on mats do not work. The slippage and sliding is constant, and when you're pregnant, that's kinda unacceptable. Somewhere I stumbled across these things and they solved the problem for me. I still use these while practicing on a thick oriental rug.Drawbacks:- As other reviewers have mentioned, the way the material is knit the part between the toes can get tight and cut in uncomfortably when doing poses that move weight across the feet, like Triangle or Warrior. I also have slight webbing between my 2nd and 3rd toe, so that exacerbated the problem, but I snipped the very middle of the fabric there to accomodate my toes and that also solved the pressure problem.- I primarily purchased these b/c DownDog is such an integral part of the various routines I follow(ed), and that's also when I was sliding the most b/c of the weight distribution. It didn't take long, however, for the nubbies on the big toe (my key grip in this position) to start to wear off. Fifteen bucks is a lot to pay just for big-toe nubbies.Successes:- The nubbies actually work. They helped me grip whatever surface I was practicing on. And unlike other brands, the nubbies cover the entire underside of the toe, not just the pad, and when my feet are flexed in DownDog I need that entire surface gripping for me.- They're highly breathable and comfortable (once I snipped between the toes). My feet don't over heat. I forget I have them on.So, while I wish the nubbies lasted longer, the fact that they do the job they're supposed to while they last will spur me to continue to purchase this brand."

84405,0,"I purchased this monitor to avoid having to wear a chest strap during my workouts. I thought that the strap would be uncomfortable and I like the idea of just touching the face of this monitor and getting my heartrate. The first time I used it, I had little difficulty. It is easy to program, gives an adequate amount of info for the average fitness routine and relatively comfortable. However, once I started my first workout, I encountered some problems. This monitor is difficult, if not impossible, to use while running. You must stop or slow down considerably to allow your fingers to make a decent connection with the sensors. It took me a few tries to get a reading, by which point my heartrate had dropped. I had the same difficulty while spinning. I was not able to keep track of my heartrate until I was sitting and in recovery. This isn't really convenient in a standing climb where you're trying to reach a target and can't tell where you're at until you're finished. Plus, I wasn't always able to get a reading the first time and had to try again, and sometimes again, leaving me with a less than accurate reading.I still really like the convenience of this item, however it doesn't seem to work for the type of exercise I'm doing. It seems like a great HRM for those who don't like a chest strap and are doing low impact activities or interval programs that allow for some down time in which to get a reading. However if you are involved in continuous or high impact movement, I wouldn't recommend it."

501908,0,"I agree with the previous reviews stating the ""adult"" size is very small. I have to agree. I am a petite/average sized female and this mouth guard fit me, but I don't see how this would fit the average male. I use this for roller derby and while it is effective at protecting my mouth (kept me from losing teeth a few times), it's just very bulky. I cannot close my mouth and it feels awkward. The back of the guard also rubs into my gums, occasionally causing sores. I'm getting ready to order the ProTech Dent mouth guard at the recommendation of many other derby sisters'. It's smaller and offers just as much protection."

115948,0,"Beware those who sweat a lot--I bought this mat because it was recommended to me by a friend who specifically noted its fine performance during a sweaty practice. I have not found that to be the case. Although I slipped much more on the original cheaper yoga mat I had, I still slip on this one, and thus go through the same frustrations. I tried hand-washing it a few times, but that did not help. The Manduka mat is high quality, long lasting, and overall a nice yoga mat. But for those who have slippage problems, this may not solve them. I borrowed a friend's rubber yoga mat, and found that it provides much more stabilization."

66339,1,"I have braved the back country and mountains of Eastern Haiti, the rapids of the Canadian Alagash, and the frozen peaks in Tennessee. This is the toughest hydration pack you will find. However, it is not a day pack. I own a North Face Big Shot and the straps are in the perfect places for the clips on this Camelbak. All hiking packs and some day packs will have the straps this items requires to be hauled around, and if not you can always stuff it inside the pack. The clip at the very top of it is perfect for canoeing, as you can strap it around a thwart and canoe without worry of losing it if you tip, even though half of you don't care about that. The one problem I have with this item is that you can't directly attach the straw thing to the straps on a pack unless the pack has a loop for that purpose.The bottom line is that this is a durable little sucker and the purpose of the four clips is that you don't have to take up precious space in your pack."
253759,2,Do not buy.. The pump nozzle does not work correctly on average bike wheel air nozzles. I could not get this pump on now matter which way I tried to outfit it on the wheel nozz. Also the pump is much smaller than the picture fitting in the palm of my hand meaning the range of the pump will deliver very little air per pump. Depending on how much pumping you have to do (if you can even get the nozzle on) you will be pumping for quite a while.
99866,0,"I like this table very much. It is very easy to maneuver and move, as well as fold up and down. My only issue is that there doesn't seem to be any mechanism to compensate for an unlevel floor - I would have expected some kind of leveling mechanism, but there is none. As a result, the table tends to have a gap between the panels, and looks a little warped. I have a handyman friend who is going to install levelers, and then it should be fine, but I would have expected the manufacturer to anticipate this problem."
248014,1,This is the second time I've had ants invade my house. The first time they came through a small space by the kitchen window. Just recently they invaded my bedroom. The common denominator is that ants will detect any food that is left behind. Even bits hardly noticeable to the human eye. So to avoid ant invasions keep your house as clean as possible. Now for the review. They suggest you clean the around the area first. Then put a few drops on the provided cardboard and watch the ants swarm Terro like it's crack. Like pigs in a trough. An important thing to remember is that in order to kill the colony you have to kill the queen first. It's also mportant that you resist the urge to smash them because the more ants you have eating the bait the faster the colony will die plus this will only stimulate the queen to produce more ant larvae at a faster pace. The ants eat the Terro which they take back to the rest of the colony to feed the larvae and queen.The ants themselves die eventually because the poison acts slow enough for them to get back and spread it around(they feed each other). How brilliant. Now it's been about 4 days and they're almost all gone. Terro 2 ants 0.I found the crack where they're coming in from and I'm gonna seal it with some caulk.

371125,1,"We bought these for my 4 yr. old for his first attmept at ice skating. The fit was fine, and he did well on them but then we notice a screw on the ice behind him. You really need to double check the screws under each skate. They tend to come loose and fall off. Once my husband REALLY tightened them they were o.k. If we hadn't noticed the screw on the ice the whole this would have just fallen apart and been rendered useless. They're needed to adjust the length of the skate to fit your child's foot. Buy them, just bring pliers."
307921,2,"I returned the product. After about a week it blew a fuse in a my car (the trunk fuse in a jetta so 20W instead of 15). After blowing 2 more fuses I disconnected this device and things worked again. I tried it one last time in the cigarette lighter port and blew that fuse as well. During the week that it did work it never cut the power to my device, so either my battery was strong enough to not drop to the level required to make this sever the power or it simply did nothing..."
149700,0,"I've used this bike computer for several years and every one has had the same problem - it shuts off for no apparent reason and then starts back up. Some sensors seem to be better but virtually every one I've had does it to some extent, including this new one I bought to put on a new bike. It also doesn't make sense that the battery cannot be changed easily. I probably wouldn't recommend this but I'm married to it now with at least three sets on six bikes."
189424,0,This are a good winter sock. I wore them last week on a over night backpacking/Hunting trip and my feet got way to hot and were wet the entire time. It might be the boot I wore but my feet were uncomfortable the entire time.
484566,0,"I had a very hard time deciding on what trailer to get to tote my 3 and 1 year old sons in behind my bike. We decided on teh WeeRide Stage Coach Double. When taking only one child on a ride it is perfect. The five point safety system holds them securely in place. When taking both boys on a ride they must be cramped. It is fun at first and then one kid will touch the other and oh boy look out. They do both stay in place, but when we take corners the bump into one another. I am sure this would be a problem with any trailer fit for two. It is super easy to attach to my bike, which I love. So, if I do go by myself its not a pain to take the trailer off and on again and again. We do enjoy the pouches to store small toys for the boys to play with while on the ride. It is a great buy for the price."
17535,2,"I got these for my road bike that didn't have fender braze-ons. The basic problem is that because they are so small they don't completely protect you from wheel spray. i suppose they are better than nothing, but I tend to want fenders that completely protect me from road spray. Also, they have black rubber-ish pads that sit against the fork when attached. I used these on a white Look frame and the black ended up discoloring the frame - it is still there years later, even though I didn't keep these that long. Probably not a problem unless you have a light colored frame and even then you may not care, but it bothered me."
209463,0,I fit within the size requirements of the size chart but these seem to run smaller. :(
43582,1,"I found these earmuffs while shopping for more expensive, electronic noise-cancellation headphones, and I decided to give them a try before investing in something electronic.The reason I was in the market is that I am a graduate student and an English teacher, and I needed a quiet space at home to work. Our house is very small, and when my wife watches TV in the evenings it is difficult for me to concentrate on my reading. These earmuffs do an excellent job dampening every ambient sound in the room. At a normal listening volume, the TV--which is less than 10 feet away--sounds like it is on the other side of a thick wall. If I concentrate while wearing the earmuffs, I can still detect faint snippets of dialogue, but the dampened TV volume becomes so quiet that I can focus on academic reading.These earmuffs are big enough and strong enough to do the job! They would probably be a bit cumbersome for travel, since they are made for working in noisy environments and shooting ranges. But their noise reduction capabilities are very good--even if it is just to find a quiet space in a noisy house. Because these work so well for my purposes, I will not be buying electronic noise-cancellation headphones."

176428,0,"I needed more running/work out shorts, and I couldn't find anything to really beat this price. I love soffes, specifically because they ""move with your body"". They're normally not too baggy, falling down, or not fitting in those ""awkward"" areas.Either I've gotten to be a smaller size, or these shorts are knock-offs...because these shorts don't fit me like my other soffes. They're awkwardly baggy in the crotch, the bum isn't defined, the legnth is a bit longer than the others (even when ""properly"" rolled up).The main pro is that the material is very soft and comfortable. So I could see myself wearing these to the gym, and maybe even to bed on a warmer night.So bittersweet? I guess."
1919,1,"I signed up for track recently and some other guy sugested that I get some compresssion shorts, so i did. they gave me a lot of support for practice and meets. There are no locker room problems with these. They are really comfortable and snug and give that male support needed.i've noticed that it sort of shows you're pubes through the fabric sometimes, but other than that they are wonderful; i wear them still even after track season."

27108,2,"I was planning on using this bag for school, but it's god awful small (I can't exaggerate this enough). Stated on the 2nd picture, it says it's 18 inches deep. It's bull, don't fall for it, I measured it myself and it was roughly 13-14 inches deep. Any Molle pack can pull off school books and supplies but struggling to fit even 2-3 college text books is a disgrace. AVOID THIS BAG"
416065,0,"It is real a good product, which looks very strong and well made. The delivery is very fast, I got it in the next day! The reason I give three stars is that the bag I received is not the same color shown in the picture. Mine is gray all around!! I think it should be grey and light dark just as the picture shows, which looks better."
435564,0,"I love the pack and all it's features. It fits very well and is built solidly. I did not like, however, the massive space that was taken by the frame system. It was hard to put objects in the pack and hard to put anything with a rigid form in the pack (bear bin, pots...)"
401652,1,Shorts were received and mailed onto a friend in Brazil - he is now very happy!!
282827,2,Boots were not very comfortable. I like the original foot clamp better on the board. Perhaps the boots work better on a bar set up.
106616,1,"I gave it four stars because it didn't seem as sturdy as i would have liked it to be, but since I am not a knife expert I am only going by how it seemed to me. My son was delighted with it so maybe I should switch to five stars. The price was good and he is happy, and he collects knives."
215733,2,"I bought this helmet at a local bike shop. It was reasonably priced & as others mentioned it does fit a bit snug. I'd give it 3 stars, but minus 1 star for fit, & minus 2 star because the visor is so flimsily attached by these three small plastic tabs.Maybe after about a month of wear, I was about to make a right on a busy street, and the middle snap broke off on the visor, literally dropping the visor directly into my face (over my eyes)! I seriously almost crashed going down hill on a busy San Francisco street. I would strongly recommend that you just pull off the visor to begin with. You don't want to experience that horror that I briefly felt.Now that the snaps are off, I feel that the helmet is now reasonably safe. but talk about a close encounter!"
355829,1,"Am training for a marathon, and these shirts work just fine for endurance running"

397148,2,"This computer was good while it lasted. I bought it in March. At the end of May the main sensor started to shut off sporadically - the speed indicator would go to 0 in the middle of the ride, then would turn back on 20 min later. This became progressively worse and by mid June it died completely. A week ago the cadence sensor bit the dust too. I expected a longer lasting piece of electronics from a Japanese company..."

416610,1,I think these would work better on a younger gal than myself but they're still good for the gym and around the house. I think they run small so you may want to go a size up.
52195,2,"This rack is not worth the price. the metal is thin, weak and malleable. the foam is cheap pvc insulation. the caps are not even glued on. the hardware it comes with is a joke. your board will deform the racks with any kind of repeated use rendering them useless. if you have a heavy board, these racks will not hold it.

496036,0,The shirts are nice but the sizes are extremely roomy. I bought a couple of these for my dad who is pretty stocky and always wears and x-large but these were very big on him.
137502,0,"We bought two of these for a camping trip that our family took on a local river and they were primarily used by our 5 and 3 year old boys. They were quick to inflate with an air compressor at a local gas station/grocery store near the campground. They were strong enough to last the entire camping trip while being used by both our two boys and by our neighbors two children as well. When it was time to breakdown camp I was dismayed to see how slowly they deflated... 20+ minutes per tube with a ball point pen in the valve stem. The price was right though, so I can't really complain.In summary, if you are looking to get some of these ""truck"" tubes for river rafting, then I would suggest getting ones that are larger if possible... around 30"" or larger. These worked okay for our 5 and 3 year old kids, but speaking from experience, adults look slightly foolish rafting on tubes that are this small. Also, don't forget that it takes forever and a day to deflate these things."

375557,2,"The volleyball pal is good if you are bumping to yourself, but it still isn't that good. You can't really tell how far you are serving, because it barely reaches half of a short court! And the picture deceives you, because the string in the picture is longer than the actual one. sure, the Velcro strap that keeps the ball in place is good, but what about the belt that came loose after my daughter used it for about an hour and a half? And the string that came back so fast the first time she tried it out, she got a bloody nose? This is only good if you have better reflexes than Kerri Walsh and Misty May-Treanor."

8624,1,"And after a mile of riding after mounting this, I wondered how I could have ever lived without rear view mirror on my bike. The only &#34;con&#34; is that it is very difficult to mount (you do need lots of strength to tighten it up), but it's also a plus because one it's on, it stays one (you really don't want the mirror to swivel or move every time you hit a pothole or go over a bump). I've dropped my bike a few time and the mirror did not break."
242940,0,Used to buy these all the time now the material is somewhat flimsy and thinner than previous RA tee's. Would recommend seeing a store sample before purchasing. My ten year old RA's are more substantial after hundreds of washing and machine drying. The size is a little small for a large so avoid dryers if want it to last awhile.
405863,2,"Just received my order today, 2 of the Knives. I ordered these because the origin says: ""Made in USA"". Since when did China become the USA? These knives are made in China. I wanted the craftsmanship associated with American Manfacturing,and the Winchester name. Let's get it right, Amazon. The ""Made in America"" is worth at least 25% of your pricing. Not to mention the volume on the orders because it's ""Made in USA"".How about reducing your current price by 25% and changing the origin to ""Made in China""?"
487011,0,After I received this item and carefully looked it over I decided to eat the return shipping cost and send it back. How it works to make coffee is pretty neat but you have to be very careful not to boil the water. That doesn't seem to be a simple task on a camp fire or a camp stove. When I'm making coffee in the morning I need fast and simple - not burnt coffee. It appears that I'd need an oven mit to handle this. Also the filtering portion of the percolator seems to have awfully large holes. I'd either need to grind my coffee very course or add some sort of filter to the filter basket to catch the grains. So we tried instant coffee (bleh) on our last trip. I'll be on the lookout for a French press now.
282826,2,"Over the last few weeks, I did a TON of research looking for just the right firesafe for my home. My requirements were simple, or so I thought. Fire protection for up to 30min at extreme temps (most fires only burn really hot for under 30 min), waterproof or at least water resistant (i don't live in a flood area, so ""resistant"" can work), and moderate security against anyone looking to just be curious. Bottom line is... short of spending $800+ the list is VERY short for possibilities. I hope someone can benefit from the time I put into this, since I've still not come to a conclusion on what item I will be using for this very important task.It is 2010, and this is no longer a world that revolves around paper as the primary format by which we store our important information. With that said... most ""fire"" safes WILL NOT provide the proper protection for data related items. (USB sticks, DVDs, CDs, hard drives etc) Any safe or box rated (as most are) at 350 U.L. are NOT sufficient enough to safely protect your data items, they will ONLY protect against paper combustion which happens at temps over 420F. In order to properly protect your data you will need to find a safe rated at 125 U.L. which means that the inside of the container will maintain a temperature of 125F and a humidity level 80% for up to 1/2 hour in a fire burning at extreme temperatures.For those interested, in depth detail on U.L. ratings can be found here [...]On a side note, the other fact that I was faced with was if you do go for one of the 125 U.L. items, you will most likely not get the water protection or adequate security along with it, but that is a whole separate gripe... let's stick to fire protection :)I found several companies that offer this type of rating on products for average home use... SentrySafe, FireKing and Phoenix. I mistakenly opted for the SentrySafe 6720.First, the packaging was trashed when the item arrived, it looked like it had been rolled down the stairs. I can understand that this item is heavy (almost 40lbs) and this makes it harder to ship, but the box in a box method falls way short when not packed properly.Upon opening the item, I noticed that even the inside packaging was inadequate. The safe freely flopped around inside its container. Trying to look past this, I attempted to open the safe and see what it was all about. GOOD LUCK ! The keys were bent from being stored under the item during shipping... nice right ? Once again, I put my judgement aside and moved forward. After flattening out the key with a pair of pliers, I inserted it into the lock and to my horror realized that the lock would not disengage from the top of the unit. I was able to get a peek into the slot that would release and revealed the issue. The locking mechanism was literally bent almost to a 90 degree angle as if someone had slammed the box closed with amazing force.As a last ditch effort to a least be able to see the inside, I was able to gently pry the box open in about 10 min. (that says a ton about the security !!!) Once inside, I found that not only was the container warped and not sealing correctly, but the protection layer attached to the lid was literally torn out of it's intended screw holes and hanging on by a thread. In addition, the lock would not even come close to making contact with the intended post it's supposed to secure to.Shocked by the shoddy workmanship and presentation, I simply packed it back up and filed for a return. Unfortunately, this is not worth your time, effort of money. As of right now, I'm looking further into several other options which simply means a significantly higher price. This item seems to ring true to ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"".Hope this helped, and good luck !"

97302,0,"This product the Caravelle 300 looks great, but compared to similar sized INTEX inflatable, it falls short. Neither has TWO Boston Valves, one for each main hull cell, as larger models do. They should have two. Sevylor has thinner vinyl. 16 gauge vs 22-23 for Intex. And moreso, the main seam around the hull looks weaker. The Intex has a major 1/4 inch wide weld all around the hull perimeter. Sevylor has only a 1/16 inch weld bead around the hull. May be adequate but why take the chance? And the 200 series is fine for an adult and 1 child, but not two adults. The 300 is minimum size for two adults."

Metal detector is cheaper than the cameraso worth a shot. Made a pass and a half along the search area, and found it within5 minutes.

136504,1,"About a year ago, I tore my ACL in my right knee, so I decided to have my ACL surgically repaired. After surgery, I was not able to walk for a month, so I was just in bed waiting to recover. While I was recovering, I ate fast food constantly. That paid a toll on my body because I had gained almost Five pounds in just one month. Eight months later after surgey I went back normal activity. I weighed myself, and the scale read 240 lbs, that was a huge shocker. I had gained 20 lbs in eight months. I saw the infomercial for insanity, but I used the same excuse over and over, that I was going to re-injure my jnee. That posibility existed even if I did not workout. I decided to go ahead and buy p90x. I did the program for about one month, and was not happy with my reults because p90x mainly focuses on building muscle. I did want to build muscle immidiatly, but I wanted to burn the fat off first. I fianlly spoke to one of my friends who was doing insanity, and he convinced me to start the program. In order to protect my knee, the docotr recomended I wear a knee sleeve. So, I began insanity, and boy did it kick my ass. At the begenning, I took multiple brakes during the warm up. I was not even able to run a mile. I am currently on my second month, and weigh 219 lbs, I lost 16 lbs in just the first month. I did lose five pounds with p90x in one month. I wish I had began insanity instead of p90x. Everyday I just can't wait to go back at it."
305320,2,As a rule of thumb to all buyers who haven't ran into any trouble with LEAD Apparel don't buy an item from this company.

150563,0,"My husband and I are definitely P90X fans, but after a long wait and a pre-order of the P90X2 program, we definitely felt the need to post a review! My husband is 50, and I'm 45. After doing P90X for nearly a year, we are in the best shape of our lives. We didn't need to lose a bunch of weight, but we definitely needed strength improvements, and we got it with P90X. Our glowing recommendations (and improved fitness levels!) probably sold a ton of the programs to friends! But, of course, we were bored out of our minds after such a long time with the original program. P90X2 arrived before Christmas, and we have done it religiously. Sadly, I have to say that if it's possible to lose muscle tone while working out so hard, we've done it! New stretching moves...great; new balance moves...great; Yoga...fabulous. All this is fine, but where's the strength training? the muscle confusion? the just plain darned hard work that built such strength in the earlier program? Combining balance moves with strength training is nice, but you just can't exhaust your muscles while splitting your attention to a balance move. It doesn't work that way. Yes, you can modify the moves. I definitely modify many of the P90X moves and understand that concept completely. But, when you are in excellent shape already, and have to modify so many moves to keep them safe, I think there's a problem. If you wish to spend a lot of money on balance balls, medicine balls, and rollers...go ahead. But, realize many of the exercises that use these items seem to have been created just SO YOU HAVE TO BUY THEM. We're switching back to the first P90X program today. May throw in a few of the moves and DVDs for variety, but at this point, we're still looking for a new workout program that focuses on strength. In our opinion, this isn't it. Skip this purchase if you haven't already ordered it."

376873,0,"I have been using this product for the last month on marathon training runs. I find that the GPS is not very accurate and the distance measure tends to drift high.

Also the metal bar that goes in the front i guess to hold the bar in broke off a few months into use - but i found that i didn't really need it anyways.
236386,1,"I use the Mega-tek Rebuilder on the length of my hair for conditioning. Leave it on 5 minutes and rinse. Then rinse with the Premier Cream Rinse. This combination leaves my hair glossy, like satin and soft as silk. As long as this is available I will use only this. My hair hasn't been this gorgeous since I was a kid, I'm 59. Every day is a good hair day, now. My hair is long and slightly wavy, medium texture and thickness. The length has been hennaed and I only do roots for upkeep."
12066,1,Was just what i was looking for. Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly. My husband loves it. Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well.
79671,2,"I had such high hopes for this sequel to My Fitness Coach. My hopes were shattered. I bought this without reading any reviews or seeing any information about what the game was about. Won't make that mistake again. All of the functionality that was in the previous version is no longer here (select length of workout, what exercise you want to do, change the level, change the music, etc.). You do not have much control at all over your workouts. I am a fit person so I need something that challenges me. The previous version still challenges me. The 2nd version barely gives you any workout. Even those who never exercise will get any benefit from this. My advice, do not spend your money on this! This is yet another one of UBISOFT's disappointments (just like Your Shape)."

219316,2,"We purchased this tent from a different vendor (only because we needed the tent right away and couldn't wait for shipping), but I know I LOVE Amazon's reviews when I am looking to purchase a new product so I thought I would review this item. The light system is a neat idea and my kids loved the remote control to turn the lights off and on. We had light rain when camping and there were no leaks but I have to tell you, I was quite nervous with the wide open screened area and the rain fly barely covering it. I wouldn't trust the tent in a bigger storm, especially if there was wind. The very first time setting up the tent as a test run before our camping weekend, the seam on the rain fly ripped some where the guy lines attach. I didn't think I had the tension too tight either. We went on a two nighter weekend campout and upon taking the tent down noticed that one of the corded poles for the rain fly had snapped at the nylon cord. I checked out the cords on the tent frame too then and saw two areas that were just hanging on by a thread and about to break too. I wouldn't trust this tent on another outing. While the tent wasn't very expensive to start with, I surely expected more than one use out of it! Off to contact Coleman for a refund."
464350,0,I ordered three different brands of compression shorts before my son went to bball camp...these are nice quality but run small. Too tight for my son to wear.
120507,2,"The pictures of this watched looked amazing.That's where it ended.Supposed to be ""free-shipping"".I ended up paying $27 in shipping to get it to me.Supposed to get $30 off when I applied for the Amazon credit card.I wasn't eligible.You can't see the back of the watch-band, and that's a good thing because you would never buy it if you did.The clasp is hideously cumbersome and f-ugly.The watch is HEAVY. It feel like I had a 10 lbs wrist-weight on.Of course it had to be sized, watches like this need to have ""links"" removed to fit properly.This has to be done by a jeweler (or someone with the tools). $11 later.Battery was dead. You need to have special jeweler's tools to open the back and change the battery. $20 later.To top it off, the ""winder"" was broken and it couldn't keep time.I returned it two weeks ago.Amazon said they'ed refund me $4.98 for shipping it back. How's that since you charged me $27 to ship it to me?It cost me $14 to ship it back. Half of what Amazon charged me, and almost 4x what they are going to reimburse me for a watch that didn't even work.Still haven't seen a single penny of my money back.Picture looked great, what a cluster-mess."
389713,2,"Very disappointing. I ordered some of these and while they look pretty snazzy at first glance, they are very poorly made. Some had weird spots of tarnish I couldn't buff out. In a few of them, the piece that holds the cigarettes in place was actually backwards and upside down. And they all make a terrible clicking noise when you open them. Trying to be inconspicuous over here.I dress flasks up to resell them, but I would feel terrible reselling these. I guess I'll have to pawn them off on my friends..."
119809,0,"I have the &#34;original reproduction&#34; in carbon steel as well as the Tech Bowie. I'm no knife fighter. I just like cool stuff. The 2.0 and the Tech Bowie are recreations of the &#34;original reproduction&#34; that SOG first brought to the market. Their blades are made of AUS8 stainless rather than carbon steel and they use a finish SOG calls TiNi where the original is blued. The new blades a bit thinner than the original giving them a lighter feel.The original is definitely nicer but the point of this review is really to express a little disappointment that the 2.0's fit and finish is of lower quality than the Tech Bowie I received as a gift a year or two ago. The edge was not as sharp (but still sharp), the handle was not perfectly flush against the guard (I'm comparing that to the original as the tech Bowie doesn't have a stacked leather handle), and the TiNi finish is not as deep and shinny was on the Tech Bowie.The tip is still needle pointy and the knife is sturdy and overall constructed well. But this 2.0 seems like it was maybe made late on a Friday afternoon. It certainly doesn't give the feeling that it was made with love. Instill like the knife and can recommend it. But, for the money, I think I Like the Tech Bowie a little better."
55999,0,I have a lower back injury so I use it to massage my back and legs. It is good but if it was harder then what it is then it would have better. It is hard but it is not as hard as I would like. Also it is too expensive for a foam roller but I paid more because amazon is not selling a lot of these in this particular shape and size.

171294,0,"Everything about this hat is great in terms of quality and fit except for one major show stopper--wearing this cap WILL make you look like one of Santa's little helpers. The back portion comes to a ridiculous point that cannot be mitigated by pulling the hat down tighter. I'm sorry, but I have no desire to join the ranks of Sylvan dryiads lurking about the forest. Hat gone back."

458970,1,"Good quality replacement cleats which have a springy feel.Box count was actually 19 cleats, whereas my shoes need only 16; so its good to have a few extra ones..."
406237,1,I could not be happier with this product. The waist draw string is a feature that I am very please about.The Manufacturer had the forsight to make the string one continuous string (no breaks) so you can't lose the string in the waistband. Excellent. Russell is a name brand that I am well acquainted with as a Quality manufacture of sports equipment and clothing so I have no doubts about getting a durable product.I would not hesitate about buying this product again.
397422,0,"I did not purchase this knife for diving like most people, but just for a collection.I mainly bought this knife for the sheath, which I was very disappointed with.the straps are rubber and when wearing it it rubs against my other leg and it's kind of uncomfortable. and not only that, but unless you have small thighs, the straps will slowly pull back out of the connectors. and another thing, it takes quite a bit of pressure on the button to make it release the knife.as for the knife, it was much more pleasing. it came sharpened, and it's just a very simple knife of good quality.I wouldn't recommend buying this if you plan on using the sheath, unless you have very small thighs."
275682,1,"As stated in other reviews of this product, it reads about 8-9 fps slower than standard chronograph type units. Other than that it works well and is repeatable."
197807,1,"I do not have a newly-born child. If I did, he would wear this helmet when I played freeze tag or toss the baby in the well. In the modern world, wary of concussion risk, you simply cannot afford to not provide your child with adequate head protection. Since the Giants are the class of the NFL, they offer better concussion protection than just any old Riddell helmet. The big risk here is a neighborhood bully being jealous of your choice of NFL team and stealing the helmet, reopening the concussion risk.Obviously, he doesn't have his daddy's brains if his head fits in this thing as the dimensions are clearly designed more for a cat or dog (a Scotish or Westhighland terrier would probably be the ideal size). Dog Concussion risk? Probably the next big thing. Better to get on that train early than watch them lose their minds."
493569,0,Good price but I won't to see more colors If you did I will buy more
111423,0,"I loved these glasses for a few years, I do have to say. They were a gift and they introduced me to the brand of Bolle, Now I pretty much wear them exclusively and I have four different pairs of Bolles. The only thing that I do have to say about the Pirajas that is bad is that for some reason the frame by the hinge can be fragile. Mine broke from which I have no reason why they did. This pair was designated to my car for strictly driving and one day when I took them out of my glove compartment, they were broken, the hinge part of the frame was left in the ear arm and pretty much no way to fix them besides buying a new frame. One thing that did kind of seem weird is that they were also in a case when it happened, so it is kind of odd. But anyway, despite this, I do love Bolle now because of these glasses, and I would not hesitate to buy more or recommend them to anyone. They are durable, stylish, and have a lot more value per dollar than oakleys (which scratch if you look through them) and many other brands out there."
72209,0,"We really liked this canopy at first. It was relatively easy to set up on my own, and I'm only 5'4"". We used it in our back yard for a summer get-together, and it was great in the heat of the August North Carolina sun. Then we took it to the beach. BIG MISTAKE! Even after we used the stakes to keep it in the sand (which I asked my strong-man hubby to do), the wind blew it right up out of the sand. We tried again, and one of the poles actually broke. We were so disappointed, because it gives a lot of shade and it gets easier to put up each time - only took me 10 minutes by the third time. If you want to use this product for camping or in your yard, I highly recommend it. But do not purchase it for the beach. On the bright side, I had no problems returning it to Coleman's."
740,2,"HI All,Never ever buy this product you will lost money and it's a wast of time.........leacking after a week. fix that than find another leaking...till u trash it..and get rid of it..i have the pic and i paid for it $60 worth nothing zerrrrrrrrrrrrroooooooooooooooo."
397112,0,"First the good: I like the display even thought the refresh rate is a bit slow. I like having the speed and cadence displayed together despite the cadence being a smaller font size. (This shouldn't be a problem if you're wearing proper spectacles.) The mount sports a molded clamp so there are no tiny screws to fiddle with and lose. You can position the computer on the bar or the stem. A nice feature if you don't want to clutter up your bars. The wheel sizes for two bikes can be stored and an additional pickup kit can be purchased for a reasonable cost. It has two trip mileage counters, average speed, elapsed riding time and, of course, a clock.The tragic flaw: If you throw your bike in the back of your pickup with the bars hanging over the side, be sure to remove the computer. My little truck is not particularly rough riding but apparently 10 miles of highway was enough to dislodge the computer from its mount. It probably was only a matter of time then, before I would have lost it while riding down a fire road. For this reason, if you ride on less than smooth roads, I would recommend a unit with a twist lock mounting system like that used on Sigma computers."
409449,1,I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar. He is very pleased and the vest looks great. The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck.
222864,0,"The exercise ball came a little earlier than promised and in good nick. The ball is the size I expected, feels sturdy, and the scent it has doesn't bother me. However, it's a little awkward to inflate the thing. Other brands I've seen provide a small tool to extract the air plug - I have to use a plastic spoon. The hose feels flimsy and crimps easily - I'll be out of luck if the hose fails.All in all... It's okay."
291231,0,The bottle works well. The cap securely fits without issue. I didn't realize that it was made in China until I looked under the cap though. I like the cap because you can hook it onto a stroller and not have to carry it.
344021,0,"It is difficult to get a leak free fit with these goggles. If I make them tight enough to be leak proof, I have a headache after a half hour of swimming and the evidence is on my face for several hours after swimming. So, if you swim for less than a half hour, they aren't a bad choice, but for longer periods, I wouldn't recommend these goggles."
509249,1,This is a good racket for all around players that don't want to spend more than $40 on a paddle. I played with mine for the past few years and have been satified with it. It stayed in good shape and it wasn't until recently (after about 500 games) that I really started to notice the spin and speed were gone. It also helped me define my strengths as a player which made it easier to choose the paddle that was right for me.If you are a good player that has an agressive style of play you are better off choosing the Carlos Chui paddle for the additional speed and spin. That paddle produces a lot of top spin which has helped me hit more winners and make less errors on smashes.

233095,1,"It comes in a cardboard box and when you open that there is a plastic black-rectangular box which hold the Hoppes aluminum cleaning rods(3), patches, and patch attachment for rod, brush for 12 gauge, Hoppes 9, Hoppes lubricating oil. This case isnt great at all/weakly built and my two tabs that hold it together, wont stay and the thing that separates the items inside is a thin plastic mold that is as thick as paper. The patches and accessories are in separate cardboard box's. I recommend it if you need a easy one step shop to clean your gun and comes with all the materials you need to make a reliable/clean shotgun! I recommend getting a tackle box and if you get a different caliber, all you need to get is the brush and maybe patch attachment accessory which will usually be pretty cheap. Also a good tooth brush, nothing too rough(No wire brush or anything that could scratch/cause damage to get into hard spaces and gloves come in handy(no pun attended)lol so you dont leave moister and fingerprints that could possibly cause rust or make all your hard work worthless."
358698,0,"I just received the hammock and stand. Overall, the quality is good. Until the hammock stretches out a bit, it is unstable and will roll you out. We just tied the ends down to keep it from rolling until it stretched out. the stand is very stable and of good thickness. the only negative is that the stand pieces are not held in place other than gravity and friction. We drilled holes and bolted the pieces into place."

95242,0,"I had to find a case to hold my Jim Palmer autographed Orioles cap. For $15 this is a pretty good deal. The plastic is very clear and clean. However the bottom is quite annoying to get on and there is a little hole in the bottom that could potentially let dust in and build up. This is a good temporary fixture, but I think I will upgrade to a full glass cubed case eventually that is sealed closed. I am amazed at how quickly the product was delivered. Standard ground shipping from Florida only took about 3 days."

70406,0,"I am overall happy with this small ball- purchased for my soon to be toddler. However, when viewing the different options available I chose to purchase a ball that included the names of the animals along with each picture.

Again, good ball and fun for my child, but not exactly as pictured."

Not the most comfortable ride, but the rack didn't budge! Anyway you gotta love this thing, it's simple and it works!"
23624,0,We were unable to use this helmet. It states it fits heads 48-52cm. My son's head is 50cm (as measured both by our well baby visit a month ago and my own measurement before ordering). The only adjustment is front to back. The sides are too narrow for his head. It looks like a nice helmet but I have to return it since it does not fit. instead of more such guesswork we are going to an actual bike shop tomorrow to try them on in person and get a good fit. I might suggest you do the same instead of relying on the stated size range.
122578,1,"I have been using PowerPro on my ocean going boat for about 5 years now (I think?), and I will not use anything else. I have 30# PowerPro for my salmon trolling gear, and 80# for my halibut line. It works GREAT. I've caught up to 70# King Salmon on the ocean with the 30# line and never had an issue. I've caught a halibut that was guesstimated at over 300# with the 80# line! Granted, we never got that big halibut to the boat... BECAUSE THE HOOK BROKE before the line did. After 2.5 hours of fighting it, the hook straightened out and the fish got away. In 20 years of halibut fishing out of Homer Alaska, that was the biggest fish I have hooked, and it's only a guess but I'm saying 300+. I've caught a number over 100-200# and this one was far harder to reel up and fight with. But regardless of the size, the hook gave out before the line broke.I love the fact that it is much thinner than normal line. With the tides in Cook Inlet Alaska, we have a tidal difference of up to 30 feet. That's a LOT of water moving, so sometimes there is just too much tide to fish the bottom. Using the PowerPro line allows me more bottom time as it is not as affected by the tide since it is narrower therefore there is less drag against the line.The biggest thing with this line, and any line for that matter, is to strip some off and retie your terminal tackle, as the line at the end will chaff and get nicked - you just cannot get away from that, it's a byproduct of fishing. And with doing that, I have had the same line spooled on my reels for over 5 years. I'm finally getting new line to respool my reels, and it's all PowerPro."
139490,2,"The grip master is comfortable on the palm of the hand, but not on the fingers or finger tips. The press downs are hard plastic and after a while your fingers are going to start to hurt if you dont have fat cushiony fingers, my fingers are hurting days after my first set. And no its not because I don't have the strength to do it, I have no problems pressing them down its just that they are not comfortable, they should've made the finger press downs the same as the palm grip, RUBBER!!! not hard plastic."

82630,0,"I needed to order these shorts for my daughter to fit requirements of a fitness program she was going through. They fit her a little shorter than pictured on the manaquin (why don't they use real people in these pictures?), and so they didn't meet the requirements.Material is just your basic, thin stuff. But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her. I'm glad they are now using a read model. They held up for a few months before they ripped. They served their purpose."

20874,2,"My wife bought me this watch because I said I had to have it. However when it arrived I noticed it looked and felt like a watch a child would own. I'm saying it felt like a cheap plastic toy on my wrist. It reminded me of something Lego would make for kids or Transformers, but sadly this watch doesn't transform into something cool. I love La Crosse Technology and I'm confident the watches ability to measure nature is precise, but the shell its in is weak.I love the watches functions, but hate the way it's made. I hope the company re-releases this model, making it more durable to stand up to the elements it measures."

I've received several compliments on it's look and color."
287223,0,"I gave this product 3 stars for one reason: the color is NOT what I ordered. I ordered PURPLE; I received what looks like an odd navy blue. The whole purpose for ordering purple was to match a team uniform. Although the UA tag had a purple strip to indicate the shirt was purple, it was not. I'm guessing it was a factory second because of the color. I will choose another vendor -- UA directly -- to ensure I receive the color I expect."
509629,0,"Really light and thin, feels kind of awkward in my hand. Rubber was ok for casual player. For 30 bucks I would invest in something else, I don't think it is worth 30.

184833,2,"when i received these bottoms, I didnt expect much because polypro is plastic basically. I dont blame the seller for the quality. These pants do not flex with your movement and they were a bit snug on the legs. The one great thing about these is they make a great wind block. I bought these mainly for warmth but they are not flexible enough to move with your body. they kept puklling on my knees. They also make me sweat but its no different than wearing a plastic trash bag. The vender sent them very quickly and I was pleased at the quick response. i just did not like the quality and flexibility. I wish they made a really warm pair of these undergarments that was really warm and breathed."
291121,0,"I spent a lot of time reading reviews for stainless steel water bottles, and they all seem to share the same cons (Made in China, leaking seals, water left with a metallic taste) except for the CamelBak Better Bottles. I looked over this Klean Kanteen bottle, because there were over 700 reviews, most with high marks. I figured this must be a great product if so many are reviewing it (and there must be many more who bought it but are not reviewing it), and the price is great, starting at $12. It may be a great bottle for most, but I'll tell you why I didn't order it.Keep in mind I did not take the time to read all 800+reviews of the best bottles, but what I've found is that almost all of the SS bottles rated highly are made with food-grade steel, but the CamelBak Better Bottle is the only one I saw made with surgical steel. The food-grade metal may account for the metallic taste reviewers reported with most bottles, and CB reviewers reported no such problem. The KK description mentions there is a low nickel content, but it may be enough to cause a metal leaching concern at most, or a bad taste at least.I also learned that all or most of these bottles are made in China, including ThinkSport and Klean Kanteen, which makes me question how safe some are. I actually could not find definitive info about the manufacturing of CB bottles, but I did read somewhere that major components of their products are made in the US. The Eco Usable bottle filter is made in the US, but the bottle itself is made in China. The Sigg bottles are Swiss, but they have epoxy liners that may leach BPA.After weighing all the pros and cons, I decided to go with CamelBak, even though it costs $18-$23. Maybe you get what you pay for here. The CB website offers helpful info at the FAQ link. The website [...] rates their bottles highly, and they like the straw feature. The only common complaint at Amazon about the CB bottles that was of interest to me is that the bite valve may be difficult for some users and the valve and straw need to be kept clean, but many liked not having to tip the bottle in order to drink from it. You can order a standard CamelBak Classic Bottle Cap for these bottles for $5 if you prefer. Users liked the wider mouth to fit ice cubes through easily, but mentioned the insulated one doesn't fit in most car cup holders (no big deal). They also seemed to rave about the insulation quality of the insulated bottle, but the non-insulated bottle is about $5 cheaper. Since I needed a bottle carrier anyway, I'm ordering the CB insulated carrier to go over my non-insulated Better Bottle. Also, at 8 oz., the non-insulated bottle is a bit over half the weight of the insulated one.Well, thanks for reading. Let me know if this helps. I'll do a separate review in the next month or so after I've used the CamelBak bottle.PS: I just have to pass this along. I emailed CamelBak and asked where their products are manufactured. They were nice enough to reply right away. Here's their answer: ""Thank you for contacting CamelBak. Our water bottles are produced in China . However, our manufacturing partner in China was selected after an extensive vendor screening process. We have conducted multiple fair labor audits of this facility and all have passed. No child labor is employed in this facility. Tests are preformed to include the evaluation against a long list of known toxins and carcinogens. All our products have passed the testing. We are constantly monitoring product quality coming out of this facility; we have worked with this partner for several years and have a trust based on their continued good performance against our quality standards."""
471657,0,"This jacket fits great, and looks great, but is just a bit too thin. I love the raspberry jam color! I would like the jacket better if it was completely lined. It will keep me dry, and prevent the wind from coming through, but will not add warmth. It is also noisy and the nylon makes a swooshing sound when my arms rub the body of the jacket. It was almost worth the price I paid. If I had paid more, I would have been really disappointed."
485215,1,I am a Hugh Cold Steel Fan and I love this knife and any knife just about that cold steel makes! there strong durable and razor sharp!!! a deff buy!!
339360,0,"I've had this product for over year. It works extremely well. The User Interface its a tad klutzy (if you are looking at previous day), but it performs well.What didn't perform well, was the plastic belt holder.I called Omron Health Care to purchase a replacement, and was told, they DO NOT SELL ANY REPLACEMENT PARTS for this or other pedometers.Huh? Well if I would give them the serial number on the inside of the back cover, (I needed to find a small screwdriver and magnifying glass!) they would send me one free, BUT ONLY this one time.I was made to feel totally ungrateful, and that I was trying to get ""something for nothing,"" which was NOT the case at all.Great product. Crappy Customer Service.Incidentally, when the plastic holder breaks, the pedometer works just fine, if it's in your pocket! Avoid the hassle, and feeling like an ingrate!Wayno"
274274,0,My son loves this tricycle. It is sturdy and rides smoothly. I had to apply WD40 one time to its tires to stop the squesking but that is nothing to complain about. We were unable to affix the parent handle bar so that feature hasnt been used. I would recommend it.
370768,1,"Perfect choice for anyone looking for a reliable, heavy-duty folder that can handle any task expected from a pocket knife and then some.The blade is fairly large and has a very practical shape. Shaving sharp out of the box, good edge holding, can be sharpened to a razor edge easily. I've often used it as a paring knife in the kitchen and it's equally at home outdoors for anything from whittling to setting up a survival shelter. The grip is highly ergonomic and fits the hand well, much better than most modern EDC folders with ultra light, skinny grip scales. It won't slip even if wet or greasy thanks to the rubber inserts. Can be opened one-handed easily with either hand.While pretty big for a folding knife it's still not overly huge and can be carried in a pocket conveniently, especially if you're wearing BDU's or cargo pants. Lock up is absolutely solid and can be adjusted with Torx screws if necessary.For those who need a practical, sturdy knife but can't carry a fixed blade the Mule is a natural choice. Also, the value is hard to beat. Thumbs up, all the way!"
24258,2,"I didn't expect this to be a high quality dart board but I did expect it to work. No matter how hard or soft you throw a dart, when it hits the board it drags down at least 3 inches. This is a horrible product and it is not usable in the least bit. Don't waste your money. Spend an extra $10 and get a real magnetic dart board if you still want a cheap one."
229937,1,Got these for my daughter's boyfriend. He's crazy about them. It's really hard to find any kind of Chicago Bears items when you live in the center of PA - it's either Steelers or Eagles! He put them on and they fit great. Loves em!
41755,0,"The unit performs OK. Disappointed that it didn't have a manual stopwatch or a trip up function. Seems to be the same as a 906 which is a cheaper unit. Sigma computers are very reliable and last longer than any other I have used. However, the sensors break down and are hard to find when you need to replace one.Mike"
1179,0,"Bought this product as a ""new"" product. Got it, and installed it, and it would not work. The base was ok,but the light would not come on. My dad has the same thing,so we tried his light,and his worked great. Upon closer inspection, we found that the bottom plug on the pole light where it plugs into the base had been tampered with and opened before. This item appeared to be in factory packaging, but the light pole had plier marks on it where I guess someone else tried to get into the wiring after it would not work for them. After about 2 hours of working with it,and rewiring it, we finally got the pole to work. I was very dissapointed that this seller advertised this as a new product, when it was clearly used, just repackaged."
436589,0,"Shorts without pockets are not what I usually wear, but these are okay. They are comfortable. At least they fit!"
197272,0,"I LOVE every product made by this company, and these bands are no exception. HOWEVER, during my last order of my Expand Your Hand Bands, I was unpleasantly surprised to learn that they are composed of a new silicone type rubber, and that the green and yellow bands were significantly softer than the white bands. In other words, they were not graduated the way they should be. Hopefully this is just a bad batch."
112987,2,"They did not fit my head, they where way to big, and i have a medium-large head. Also not very comfortable."
395522,1,"I tried this product for the first time yesterday, OMG!! this product is awesome, it feels so good on my feet. They stayed in place and provided perfect warmth for even more than the five hours per the package. They are very light and are comfortable except for the heat you don't even notice they are there. They do not get too hot either like the hand warmers or toe warmers. I love this product and won't go skiing, or snowshoeing without them. It is very cold up here in Idaho."
493388,1,"I recieved a KSC USP compact system 7 instead of the KWA advertised. It is comparable, but would have been nice to know previous to getting in the mail. The manual I received looks to be in chinese only? Unfortunatly I don't speak or read Mandrin."
347328,0,"There are some pretty well written reviews already here, so I'll just write bullet points.1. My rack only had two of the four caps to cover the legs, so when I used the rack as a stand, it marred my tile floor.2. It was too wide for my Ford Ranger with bedliner, so I had to remove all but the minimum of the adjusting hardware to make it work.3. The foam pieces were too thick to fit with my Hybrid Bike tires, so I had to swap them out with some thinner pieces from the hardware store.4. You must put the rear wheels into the rack, which tends to push up or press sideways against the derailers.It's far from perfect, but with a little tweeking, this rack does do the job."
172573,1,put 30 lbs of gear in it and held it by the handle held together no stress on the threading put it on my molle gear with zip ties and still has ever thing in it holding up fine this is a butt pack not a 2 qt canteen cover like in the one pic
27001,1,"This was a great bike rack, be aware however that it is really designed for 4 adult bikes. With some creative positioning we are able to include my children's' bikes so it is possible.We traveled 5 hours each way with the bikes and had no problems. There was very little movement and sway while driving with the bikes on the rack."
261004,0,This is a ribbed tank that is supposed to fit to the body. The posts that say the sizing is wrong led me to order a size large when I'm a medium. Waste of money. The sizing is correct for how the shirt is supposed to fit.
113221,0,"Standard mid range quality belt, very light, and runs small, I would recommend going one size larger, could serve in a back up roll."
438310,0,I usually wear a men's small and woman's medium in gloves. I thought these were men's so I bought a small. They were so tight and I had trouble removing them. They did seem to give me the wrist support I needed. I am using them for weight lifting. I am not sure if the padding is bothering me because the gloves are too small for me. I am thinking of ordering a medium or find another product. I thought $9.50 was a good price but a size medium costs about $15.82 and I am not sure I like the gloves that much.
327113,1,"I've been gradually buying cast iron pieces to add to my cookware. I grew up using cast iron, but did not have any in my own kitchen as an adult. This is a really nice pan, great for frying chicken as the name suggests but is also handy for many other cooking applications. Love the nice high sides and cleans up great. Would recommend to anyone!"
86846,0,amazon had to get me a $10.00 refund on shipping charges because it took 10 days to receive my order when i payed for expedited shipping.
61658,1,I love this water bottle. It is perfect for me. I love the no leak feature and the straw seems to hold up under lots of biting. Wish it were a little smaller at the bottom so it would fit into my car holder better. No complaints so far.
225812,1,I'm sure the swords were in perfect condition when the seller had them last but when I received them I was a bit disappointed. The ends of the sword's sheath didn't have anything to protect them so they're a bit banged up. One sword just had mild scratches while the other had scratches and a large chip missing. The actual blade is fine and I'm sure I can fix the ends but otherwise confused as to why they didn't put styrofoam at the ends of the swords to keep them safe. Thankfully we're not using the swords until this summer so that gives me enough time to come up with a good way to repair the ends. So if you can get past that they're good quality for the price.
459744,2,this is my first time ordering from this web site and probably the last time i ordered 2 new makita batteries and got open package with used ones ...
117924,0,Got this watch for Christmas of 08 and love the look of the watch. I like heavy set watches; watches you know will take a licking and keep on ticking. So I was disappointed with this one because of how light it really is but I hope that it holds up. The watch has a great movement and awesome highlights with the 24K gold on the bezel.Over all a nice watch that I hope will last me a very long time. We will see.
152683,1,"this thermos nissan, really are the best of the market , I already own another nissan thermos that I loved!. They keep the coffee hot for like more than 8 hours! I recommend it 100%. Buy it!"
226353,0,"This product is nice for a little cardio while sitting around. Although, I didnt find even the hardest resistance level very challenging. It is also quite irritating that it isn't a smooth rotation. I dont really know how else to describe that, but if you purchase one i'm sure you'll soon find what i mean. It is a lot larger than i expected and is tough to fit under my desk. But all in all, it makes you feel better about lounging around watching tv. I suppose it was worth its mere $20."
420606,0,"The new style mercury free super switch may be good for the envirenment, but not so good for my (almost sunk boat). I have used Rule switches & pumps for over 25 years, and I can tell you, they are TOP OF THE LINE. After over 10 years of service my mercury super switch went bad. I replaced it with the new style, on 5/10. After only 1 year the switch went bad, when I was on vacation out of town. There was heavy rain, and when I got back, I found my boat had 12+ inches of water inside my bildge. The new style switch had failed. I called Rule and they were very nice, and shipped another switch, but told me it would take 3-4 weeks to arrive. Thats when I ordered another one from Amazon. so far so good, and now I have a backup switch in stock."
14817,0,"I started a new exercise program for swimming only due to back issues and decked myself out with a bunch of swimming ""gear"" including these fins. I originally bought the red pair for asthetic reasons....don't be like me. If you haven't used fins before, they are really stiff and can cause some pain and fatigue in your legs/ankles. I tried the blue pair and while they are more flexible than the red, they still caused pain in my ankles. Now, this could be just that I'm not used to fins and this type of activity and may subside after time, so don't base your opinion on only my experience. However, DO follow the other reviewers advice like I did and get a size UP from what you normally wear. They are really tight."
413955,1,"These shoe covers are great. They do what they are intended to do. I wear a size 8 so I ordered a size medium. They fit over my shoes fine but I have to struggle a little with them. I wish I had ordered the size large and, although they would be large for me, they would slip off and on easily. I think the elastic around the top would have held them securely even with the larger size."
212130,0,I have purchased this product twice. Once it was perfect. Next time it was absolutely flop. I dont know what went wrong.
470296,0,"Once assembled, this is a very sturdy bike that should last (almost) forever. However, I have to add to the chorus of people who were perplexed by a rudimentary assembly manual (mine had one small image of an exploded view of the bike, very poor quality). Unless you are handy with common tools, you may want to plan on paying someone to assemble it for you at a local bike shop. Here are the additional challenges I had:-the matching halves of the wheel cage were together in the box but the connector clips were mostly not assembled, and were not attached to the frame in any of the three bracket locations. At the floor bracket, the cage had been dropped or otherwise damaged so I had to pry the up one side of the cage to get the screw to seat through into the connector clip through the bracket. [no mention of the clips whatsoever in the assembly instructions]-half of the fan blades were not crimped to the spokes at the hub end, which caused a ""clinking"" sound as the wheel began to turn. [no mention of any need to crimp the fan blades in the assembly instructions]-the contacts for the monitor cable at the wheel end had been pushed completely out of alignment, requiring me to use pliers to carefully straighten them so the plug would insert.-the monitor will turn on, but does not capture wheel movements.-I was shorted one screw and found several others rolling loose in the box.Someone must have used the cage assembly on this bike for soccer practice or some other similar purpose because the many problems with the cage could not have been caused by shipping problems, and it never should have made it past quality control. Obviously, this one would have been a good return candidate, but I don't have the time to mess with making all the arrangements. It may yet have to go back if I can't get the monitor working after a call to the help line.Two suggestions to the manufacturer-1. WE ARE NOT ALL ASSEMBLY PROFESSIONALS- GET A DECENT ASSEMBLY MANUAL IN THE BOX!!! There, I feel better now.2. Quality control needs to be vastly improved. It's hard enough to assemble the bike with the parts at spec, even harder when parts are bent and key components were not assembled properly at the factory.From reading other reviews, I now understand that the wheel cage is supposed to come fully assembled and attached to the frame. I suggest that anyone ordering this bike inspect it carefully immediately upon arrival, and if the two halves of the wheel cage assembly are not already attached to each other and securely attached to the frame, send it back immediately (unless you have a fair amount of experience assembling such things). Now it's time for me to get on my new bike and time my session with a clock on the mantle...UPDATE: After calling for support and receiving and installing a new magnet sensor on the frame (a magnet on the spokes generates the signal through the sensor that converts to speed on the display), the bike works very well. If you can't get the display to sense wheel speed, chances are that the sensor is bad (or the display). My wife and I are very happy with the bike, and I hope that yours arrives in better shape than mine. God bless!"
363286,0,"I would love to give this a five star review, but I can't seem to get through the whole DVD before giving up. I wanted more challenging choreography, but I feel like I could try this for the rest of my life and never figure out the steps. I can't work up a sweat because I spend my whole time watching, unable to catch on. I have watched it without doing the moves twice, and twice have tried stopping after each new move to try it over and over with no luck. It looks like it would be fun of I could figure it out! For now, I'll have to do my usual workout in the morning, and, if I have time in the evening, keep trying this little by little."
209460,1,"These might possibly be the most comfortable shorts ever made. I am a big guy 6'3"", 225# and am in good shape but I would would never consider wearing lycra to yoga class or the gym. I haven't gotten into yoga (yet!) but I can see where the fit, cut, flexibility, and ""weight"" of these shorts would be perfect. I find the XL to fit perfect for me and the legs are long enough that they don't ""ride up"" all the time so that you have to keep pulling the legs back down. I use them for workouts both alone and under lightweight workout shorts in lieu of compression shorts and they are incredibly comfortable for just lounging around the house. I thought that they might be hot but they seem to breathe very well, they are stretchy enough to ""move with you"" not hampering flexibility, and although the cotton is absorbent it dries pretty quickly. The material is thick enough and the cut is loose enough so that even when worn alone you aren't walking around with your ""goods"" on display but yet they are supportive enough for weight training and aerobic equipment in the gym and I'm sure even for the yoga they were designed for!I have one pair that I've used for over a year that show very little sign of wear and I just bought another pair of shorts and also a pair of the pants for when things get colder. Great product, great design, quality materials, great value. Buy 'em!"
425373,2,"Stay away... Hardly useful in the least.I was looking forward to this item as a portable practice tool. Within 30 seconds of receiving it, I knew I made a serious mistake.Given this vendor's return policy, I feel like I've been robbed.Like I said, stay away! Buyer beware."
350875,0,"This 2-lb medicine ball was the perfect weight when I first started exercising with it last December. Now I've moved up to a 6-lb ball, but some days I do extra sets with the 2-lb when I'm too fatigued to do multiple sets with the 6-lb. I haven't needed to inflate it yet so I don't know how well that will go. My only quibble is that the combination of yellow, grey, and black is kinda too busy-looking, esp. given the varied textures (bumps, thick lines, thin lines) on the surface. I prefer the simpler look of my 6-lb TKO Fitness medicine ball, but for the price this grips nicely and I'm set as long as I don't fixate on the colors and textures."
486258,1,I am really pleased with this watch. It'sthe ETA movement. It keeps time very well. It has a hacking movement which was a feature I liked. The company makes mostly dive watches which is why I went with this brand. I am looking forward to making dives with it. The bezel moves easily. The crystal backing is a nice feature but not neccessary. It is definitely a strong copy of the Rolex Seamariner at a tenth of the cost. It feels heavy with a nice band. I would recommend this watch.
112733,1,"I LIVE IN VENEZUELA AND THIS BRAND OF SHIRTS HAS GREAT DEMAND HERE.SO,I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL ITEMS AND THE QUALITY AND DURABILITY ARE PROVED.

39051,0,"I bought this as a replacement for another Speedo model which looks exactly the same and sold for approximately the same price. This suit is simply two layers of nylon. Much lighter weight fabric. No modesty panel. (I am an older gent). Tie is now cord, not tape and is about two feet too long. In general, feel the quality of this suit is less than the model it replaces. When this one wears out, I'll probably look elsewhere for a replacement."
461228,0,this wrislet is ok...but it smells when you get it ...The bag must be washed multiple times before it smells remotely normal
224068,0,"These shorts run ridiculously small. I triple checked the size on the tags and on the interior because I was so sure I was sent the wrong pair. Since these are so much smaller than I expected, I would definitely recommend trying these on in a store to determine size. Plus, I didn't know until too late that the seller gouges the price for shipping, in both directions, which is going to make returning them a really expensive hassle. So, be sure to review all the necessary details of the shipping policy and rates before purchasing."

106976,0,"I read the reviews and thought Id made a good decision but not sure yet. Im a first time runner and this is my first hydration pack.One of the bungies that loops over the top of my water bottle busted with first use... that sucked.The other complaint is that I also had problems with it riding up as I ran. That was a little annoying too.Other than that... it was snug and I didnt feel the bouncing. IT seemed balanced even if one bottle was more full than the other. It held my gu, keys, and ipod nano 8g and still had some room for more? I loved that the little pouch has an EXTRA pouch on the inside with a velcro closure... made my ipod feel more secure.Overall... I think it will get the job done but IM sure there are better ones out there."

433588,0,"This item was ordered because it was the size to hold a rather large yoga mat. It does have the size to accommodate the mat. On the other hand, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the materials. The fabric is very light and thin. The zipper is a light to medium duty zipper. Overall the product is not very impressive."

The price is very cheap, and I would gladly pay more if I had to, it is worth it."

366736,0,"It's just a short. Quite mediocre in quality, hence the 3 stars. I didn't have high expectations for this short since I was trying to meet a minimum total for an offer and I would only use it to lounge in. The material is a bit more rough than expected. And the red is much brighter than in the pictures. The only major issue I may see for others is the discomfort that may be caused by chafing by the inner elastic band."

266586,0,"I shouldn't expect a dual-suspension mountain bike to be light, but I could expect it to be few pounds lighter. That extra material sure is nice when beating on it, however. That being said, all components are more than suitable for the task at hand while the extras(extreme low range gear, front disk brake, etc) are usually found on premium offerings. The seat had to go in favor of a gel model, but that's a personal preference. Be warned that you may need a separate bar to get this into some racks."

458682,2,"I recieved the item with paint already chipping off the blade, it has no weight to it at all, the edge has an odd shape and the whistle on the sheath doesnt even work.

477172,2,my husband ordered this jersey and received a plain generic reebok jersey with a number 13 on it with warner above it on the back. theres no cardinal on it anywhere. it looked nothing like this at all. we are very disatisified. we really wanted this jersey and cant find one anywhere.
161392,1,great watch for the value - its sporty and has qualities you'll find on more expensive time pieces.
220372,0,"It's a football flag, seems to be pretty good quality. Only one thing wrong with it is it's a Jets flag. It's a Christmas gift for a friend and it's so nice to see the Jets struggle this year. If it was a Redskins flag, I would have given it 5 stars, just saying."
270047,1,The watch is exactly as expected except for the size. Perhaps my fault but it is not the standard man's size I expected. It is a medium size watch. Product seems of excellant quality. Latch system works well too.
428420,1,This purchase was for a friend who is a huge patriots fan and he was excited about getting his present!
56312,0,The pedals keep flipping over so its difficult to place your feet in them. I ended up returning it because I didn't find it useful.
243455,0,"Material is excellent. Since my last purchase of this product, the length has shortened up considerably. Now hard to keep tucked into my jeans. Don't buy if your over 6'. Now made in El Salvador, previously made in Mexico (I think, not sure)."

410674,1,"I have worked out for many years and finally decided to build my own home gym. Being the meticulous shopper that I am, I wanted something affordable, versatile and durable. The Ironman 3-Station Power Tower is excellent! There are other brands of towers out there but this one is the one to buy. With the 250lb max you know it's strong. I'm 6'4 and it's tall enough to do pullups. I also use the pullup bar to attach hanging ab straps to work my abs. The only negative aspect of this product is you can't do pushups with the pushup handles without hitting your face on the lower crossbar. That didn't bother me because I already have seperate pushup stands I use. I am very pleased and highly recommend this product!"
261114,1,excellent fit - just that! do not need to say anything else. color is nice and material is very good.
276828,0,"Ordered as a present for my wife...opened it up and it's like a kids size chair, just way too small. I'm 5'9"" and my wife is 5'8"". Not comfortable at all for us. The shorter side supports dug into our sides/shoulder blades. The quality was good..fabric color, it just needs to be bigger, more room to feel comfortable, like the one we wanted to replace (had that one for 12 years! before it gave out...the brand that we had no longer makes them). It's hard finding a folding Loveseat now days, and we loved ours. Returned it. Good Luck! We're still looking :).....I just wanted to add that we just got the full refund (minus the shipping) and they did not take out for the 15% restocking fee they had posted in the return section. Thank you!"
125269,0,"As others have said, this is a nice gnome but it really is kind of small, seems as if it would be lost in the garden."
462496,0,"Decent case, but not ideal for my modified Winchester Defender 1300 (see photos). There are two pockets sewn inside that can hold extra ammo, but it doesn't look like they were meant for shotgun shells. For shells, you have to skip every other slot. When I put shells in them, it makes the bag thicker because of where the pockets align with the sidesaddle on my ATI stock. I can see how this case can be good for other setups, though, just not mine.The internal pockets are also ideal for a small cleaning kit, but not much else. Fit-wise, my 36"" end-to-end Winchester fit just fine with plenty of room for my tactical light. Too bad there aren't any straps to help keep my gun from moving around inside the case, something that I have seen with similarly priced cases.I really like how the shoulder strap hooks, rings, and zippers are metal. The zippers are lockable."

I got a medium, and my circumference was a little over 7 inchesMisc: i also got lime green, which is a fun color, more so than boring standard gym black"

Another complaint from other players is that it hurts more than other balls when passed and is harder to control. For that reason it mostly sits idle waiting for the right players."

10453,1,"I ordered this one night, and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping. It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear. It has two side zip-up pockets, and the collar zips all the way up if you need. It is super lightweight, and very warm (for a vest). This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind, but not much. On a cool rainy day, wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket (shell), and it's perfect! --Very nice!"

Breitlings are great watches and I've found that they go up in value, especially if you buy the right one."

78189,0,"Being a newbie in biking, I was really into reviewing and reading the comments on this bike to help me decide if I did want to go for it. One post that I distinctly remember is someone that said the bolt that will hold the front brake in place was missing when delivered. He further said that his LBS didn't sell just the bolt so he ended up buying a whole set of front brakes. I said to myself, what are the odds of that happening to me. The price is very good as an entry level road bike and I was pleased so I did place an order. Surely enough, after receiving the bike, guess what....missing BOLT, the same thing happened to this guy happened to me. Good thing AMAZON sent me a whole new bike set just because my first one was missing the bolt. Still there is this inconvenience of having to wait for the second bike, then bringing it to a UPS close by to ship it back, it was a hassle. If you are willing to risk it and willing to do the same thing I did, go for it...bottomline, the bike is great!"
302706,1,"I first heard about this product through a few friends of mine who raved about it, even though they had only done the first week or the first month. I bought it with the attitude that whatever it takes I will DO this program. I'm glad I did, it's the finest set of exercise videos I've ever tried! It is as advertised: a series of hard workouts that will tone and strengthen your entire body, improving you at all areas of fitness. When I say hard I don't mean joyless, either. Tony is charismatic, hard-working and fun. He knows when to encourage, when to make you watch your form, when to make you smile, when to take breaks and when to not say anything. He is also very good at giving less intense alternatives to many of the exercises, which is crucial in the beginning. The videos are great for variety too, as you will be doing different ones each month. The structure of the program is great, you work out hard for 3 weeks, then you get a rest & recovery week of less intense workouts to let yourself recover. Then the next month you do different videos to work out hard but in a different way. Muscle confusion is the concept, and it really works, ask any trainer. It's a flexible program too: there's the ""classic"", which is what I did, the ""lean"" which has less weight videos for women or those who just want to concentrate on burning fat, and ""doubles"" for those who are hardcore and want more. It's important to note that you are expected to be in some kind of shape before you do these videos! Go to beachbody's website and download the free fit test, then do the test. If you pass it then you're ready.In addition to the videos there is a nutrition plan also. Please do NOT ignore this! I think one of the chief reasons I succeeded when my friends didn't was because I followed the nutrition plan. It is well laid out and makes sense, specifically designed to help your body fuel and recover itself for these intense workouts. I followed it pretty religiously and did not cheat and my body did not let me down during the videos. A word of advice: go to beachbody's site and sign up so you get support. It's free and the folks there really helped me. Your first week you will be sore from head to toe and might be tempted to quit. After this you won't be sore and your body will adjust! I'd recommend getting cheaper alternatives to the P90X equipment you should buy with the exception of the Rest & Recovery drink, it really is the best. Don't be intimidated by this program, you will thank yourself for getting it and you will be a different person by the end of it!"

301772,1,"I purchased my Black Monster 6 years ago. I had not worn a watch in a number of years, but I had always really liked watches, so I decided it was time for a new watch.Here is what I wanted. A watch that was completely stainless steel, did not need a battery, and could take a beating.Stainless steel because the oils in my skin will make short work of leather, rubber, and even some plastics.No battery because I don't want to change them.And could take a beating because I do repair work.like many others before me, I painstakingly plowed through reviews here on Amazon. I went to the watch forums and lurked and learned. I debated with myself over this and that, and in the end decided on the Black Monster.I've worn this watch almost every day since it came. I have worn it while I've pounded away with a hammer, while I've torn machinery to pieces, while I've crawled around on the floor in the dirt and grime.On a number of occasions, I've hammered on equipment while wearing this watch, so hard that I've had to take it off and stuff it in my pocket, because the weight of it thrashing around was starting to bruise my arm.This watch was been shown no mercy.So 6 years later how is it doing? It's doing fine.The case and bracelet have many small surface scratches that I'm sure could be polished out if I was inclined to do so, but it in no way has it started to look bad. If this watch had been shown love and care, instead of steady harsh abuse, I'm sure it would have no scratches at all.The crystal, as I look at it right now, has 3 scratches. One is more noticeable then the others, but you really have to be looking for scratches to see them.Make no mistake, this watch is as tough as nails.All the functions are in working order. The bezel I use to mark time almost every day. How long have I been at lunch, how long has dinner been in the oven.The bracelet locks and stays locked. -A funny side note. I was on a tour of the Neon Graveyard in Las Vegas last year and the guy giving the tour spotted my Black Monster and said that he was into watches and had never actually seen one before and asked if he could take a look at it. I said sure and handed it over. After looking closely at it he mentioned that it even had the ""wetsuit extension."" Now, I'd worn the watch so long and had never needed to use this feature, I'd completely forgotten that it was there!Time keeping. Since the very first, this watch has run a bit fast. After a month or so it will have gained about 5 minutes. I pull out the crown and set it back 5. This has not changed one bit since the day I got it. So it gains a little time, but it has been incredibly consistent.So would I recommend this watch? Yes I would.The reason I'm writing this review is because a few weeks ago I decided maybe I needed a new watch, a fancier one with a compass. I started the the process all over again. Looking at watches, making note of the features they had, reading tons of reviews. And don't get me wrong there are many fine time pieces out there. But I couldn't find one that I liked better then the one I already have. So I ordered a stand alone compass for $24 and was done with it. And have decided to stick with the Black Monster until one of us breaks."
33998,1,"I like everything about these gloves except for the thumb size. They keep my hands warm while riding in close to freezing temperatures. I still have full finite control over my shifter and brakes. I can even adjust the volume on my iPhone. However the thumb has an elastic band in it that constricts the digit just above the first knuckle. The gloves are sized correctly for every other aspect, there just seems to be this bizarre tight spot in the thumb that almost cuts of circulation to the thumb. Great gloves, just not fantastic. Good enough that I'll probably cut that piece of the thumb so I don't waste $30."
464175,0,"This sword is cheap. the steel is flimsy, the edges are marred, the handle twists slightly and makes an occasional rattle. Many elements are bent, the sheath is no good and it looks kinda funny. Never before have I wielded a two-handed short blade. The handle is much too long for this sword. I would recommend the traditional one with the anthropomorphic symbol of the goddess on the hilt and pommel. That is a battle tested, perfected design, though I can say nothing of quality. Overall, if you don't care for historical accuracy or quality, and you are using it as a prop for a play, religious rituals, ceremonial purposes or a halloween costume, as I am, it is decent. Just keep in mind that it is a $30 toy sword for big boys-- Not a celtic war blade in appearance, nor in functionality.Pros:only $30Unique looksIt's a swordGood prop or ceremonial bladeFun 'toy' to have aroundCons:VERY dirty upon arrival-- poor finish and a spot of rust on the blade (cleans up nicely with a bit of fine emery cloth)Flimsy, low-quality steelToo long of a handleNot overly sturdyAwkwardly shapedPoorly balancedMarred edgesOverall, I can't tell you whether or not to buy this blade because it truly depends on what you are looking for. History buffs- no. Weapon fanatics- no. other than that it is a fairly decent (but not wonderful) buy."

I use them a decent amount as I stop at most stop signs and lights but to think they can wear down so quickly is a let down. I would not buy them again as it is going to cost me an arm and a leg to be replacing these monthly."

463329,2,"I bought the Thermos Foogo jar for my preschooler based on the fun colors and my good experience with other Thermos products. This jar did not hold up. First, the plastic base came off - more an annoyance, as it is merely a shallow ""cup"" that sits on the bottom end of the stainless steel jar. I glued it back on several times. After about six months, the vacuum seal evidently broke down, because when I filled the thermos with hot food the outside of the thermos became hot to the touch almost immediately, indicating that the jar was not holding heat. At that point I threw it out, since the jar no longer kept food at a safe temperature. I have other Thermos products that are much older and that have not developed these problems so this might be a quality control issue. At any rate, I've replaced this jar with a different model."
235005,1,"I can agree with everything said in previous reviews here. It's all corrosion resistant metal, with a positive liner lock, quick assisted opening, solid slop- free pivot, strong pocket clip, etc., etc. A great blade design with good overall balance in my hand. And, just a very good looking knife! I liked it so much I've bought two.One thing I can add. ALL of the screws on this knife take a T-6 Torx driver. The pivot screw is very important. IF your blade movement or safety catch seems too tight or loose: From loose, turn the pivot screw to where resistance is felt, and just a tiny bit more. Any tighter, and the safety catch gets too tight.Buck quality shines here. This knife has now been discontinued, but the new Impulse is the same knife with a machined design on the handle for better grip. I have no problem with the smooth scales."

I wrongly assumed that these were 100% cotton socks. They are not, they are 86% cotton. I think maybe Amazon should include this information in a clearer way.I am alergic to some of the materials generally used in socks, so I generally cannot wear anything that is not 100% cotton (or very similar). As 86% is still high I tried them and so far I have not experienced problems."

422567,0,"First off, I like the socks. They were what I was looking for and had a good selection of colors. I even got a compliment on the field. The problem is in the protection offered by the sock. I use baseball socks to protect my legs during a slide in to a base. My last pair did this well but broke down at the foot of the sock so that my toes went through. These socks had the opposite problem. The toe area held up but when sliding in to second base, my leg got seriously busted up. I may have slid hard, it being the beginning of the season, but this open gash is similar to one I got last year when I slid in to second without any socks at all. I expected more protection than a marginal difference between socked slide and no-socked slide. (See uploaded product picture for details)"

233069,0,"I gave three out of five stars and a may be a little harsh here. The over all fit and finish is fine and the function is proper. My issue is that I bought these because I have always enjoyed the Presentation grip and you have an expectation of fit from the size of the handgun's frame dimension to the overall size of the grip. When I held my very first Model 29 with a Presentation grip I found it to be very pleasing in my hand hold. The Colt Official Police or the Python is not thicker in the frame than the Model 29 and yet the Colt version is about one and a half times as thick. It gives a very fat feel in the hand that is not unlike the Bill Jordan style of grips. If you order the Gripper series for the colt it feels just like the Model 29 Gripper so what gives? Like I said, it works but be aware it is a bit thick."
6017,1,"When placed right you can put more guns then advertised in these.

They all fit with 1/2 or more space. Now i did purchase this extra one because...it is heavy to carry all of them in one container but it will carry and fit like a dream. I highly recommend this product especially for the price."

If I had needed the shoes quickly, this would have been a major issue. As it was, I could wait, but I didn't appreciate the delay. And the shipping charges -- given that I clearly got nothing even remotely resembling ""RUSH"" or ""OVERNIGHT"" -- were extremely high. I say, ""Shoes nine, shipping three."""
452232,1,"Very comfy and soft. Live in the south, perfect year round! Size is accurate and the fit is perfect. Have 7 pairs, colorful choices"
498632,0,"3 Stars because you get what you pay for. I mistakenly bought this without reading into what I actually needed, though this product does offer some benefits. With any small-spine knife or blade that is relatively small, this is a fantastic tool-kit to utilize for the sharpening process. Any type of blade over 3 inches will require multiple placement movement which honestly renders this style of sharpening inadequate, but it can be done. For your average pocket knife, the progression of stone surfaces provided will undoubtedly meet your needs."

The only good thing I can say about it is it's easy to clean."
55544,0,"We have owned this tent for four years, and have enjoyed it a great deal. The positives are: bang for the buck, size, and realtive ease of set-up. The primary short-coming of this tent is the zippers. We have experienced regular ""fabric chewing"" when using the zippers. This has led to progressive weaknening of the zipper integrity, and then complete zipper failure on one of the doors.Did we get our monies-worth? I suppose so. However, I am now in the position of determining if it is more cost-effective and worth the effort to replace a zipper, or to buy a new tent."
376080,0,"I received this and set about the task of unpacking the carrier and installing it last night. Forst, my box had no packing materials...just the carrier and parts, so the box was just about destroyed. Surprisingly, there were no missing parts or damaged parts.I began installing this on my wife's cruiser-style bike. This thing barely fit. I'm not sure if this bike seat was meant for taller riders who were planning on having their seat raised many inches above the bottom position, but it just didn't quite fit right.I finally got everything installed, but it just didn't come together as smoothly as I expect a propduct from Bell to.Great price, great name, not worried about safety concerns, but a better-designed bracket system would do this product a world of good."
172207,1,"I purchased this knife as an edc to replace my Gerber Bear Grylls knife. While the Gerber was a pretty good knife, it was gray and bright orange and drew unwanted attention at places like work. So, I wanted a thin, black knife to be a little less obvious. The Kershaw turned out to be a good choice. As I said, this is an edc and I use it mainly at work to do thinks like open boxes and such. I chose the tactical version with tanto blade due to the aggressive look. I believe they also have a regular blade if that is more to your liking.Pros:The knife has a very slim profile making it a good fit to clip in a pocket. The blade came very sharp and I was soon missing a few patches of hair on my arm. The knife comes equipped with Kershaw's Speed Safe assisted opening system, which I love. It deploys quickly with very little pressure and, so far, doesn't make me worry about it accidentally shooting open. Another pro is that the clip is reversible, which is one of the first things I did, changing it to make the blade point down.Cons:While I have very little complaints with this knife, one is the grip. The grip is very rough, which is how it is meant to be to avoid slippage. While this is nice while handling the knife, it can be rough on the hands if you shove them in your pocket very often. This is a minor complaint when compared with the benefits of this knife.In conclusion, I recommend this great knife."
486194,0,"Overall Im happy with the shorts... I mean, it's really a piece of fabric to cover part of your legs.I have to say thou, one must double clarify the size thing on these. I read the reviews on this product before making the purchase and ordered an L size and frankly they are too small, I'm a 4 and these shorts squeeze my love handles so, that I cant really wear them with a tight shirt without looking like a fatty.Other than that they'r fine.I would recommend them however make sure you get the size you need."

501381,2,This is a great item until you have a need for parts. my elderly neighbor is 86 years old and still fishing after two bouts of cancer. I installed this on his boat to make life easier for him and it worked great for awhile . When it quit altogether was when we found out about the lousy parts replacement system from Minn-Kota. What was needed was a simple set of brushes for the Chinese made electrical 12 volt motor which is a very normal parts replacement item from most reputable companies that normally cost less then five bucks.Actually we only needed a single brush but they usually are better replaced in pairs Mot minkota.. you have to buy the whole motor and get this also the attached gear drive and transmission which has four screws attaching it to the the anchor lift. The transmission and gear drive take about four minutes to separate from the motor if they could be bought separately.. An authorized Minn-kota service center happily soaked my friend for one hundred and sixty eight bucks to change the motor and attached gear drive.That's a hard whack for some-one on social security. this is a sad commentary on a company that has built its' reputation on electrical motors!!buy anything but minn-kota

When I seat alone o away from someone with HRM, it works well."

103281,1,"I got this to put on some of my pistols for range use and I can say that it adheres quite admirably to whatever surface you put it on. I even put some on the bottom of my boots to help give the extra worn areas a bit of extra grip and in three weeks of daily wear the little bits of tape I added are still there. This is also a LOT of grip tape, I could redo everything I've done at least a dozen times. It's more enough to cover an entire household step.Pre-cut panels of grip tape are easily twice the cost for a single firearm; this stuff is enough to do over a dozen guns and the amount of prep time is trivial. I would recommend that anyone who wants to add a little bit of extra grippiness to their competition pistols to look here first. It took maybe five minutes to make a pattern for my pistols using painter's tape."

Otherwise, I'd rate this bottle 4.5/5 or even higher.FYI, I usually use it to hold Gatorade mix for playing sports.

76537,0,"We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down, he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger, he was able to ride more successfully, but I would say still not comfortably. Also, getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.Pro:- Solidly built- Looks great!- Fairly easy to assembleCon:- Hard for my son to get on and off- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike, IMO- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands- HEAVY!"

There was a lot of play, and the plastic seat itself even 'slumped' a little when my son wasn't exactly centered, which was most of the time. When it slumped my knee hit one side each pedal round. Very annoying, and I had to look down and see him sort of off-center all the time. Wasn't happy, so ordered the Bobike. Similar concept, and it turns out, better execution. I returned the Ibert and kept the Bobike, which was better made, more secure, and sat my kid up more which he liked."

379121,0,"I would have liked to see the actual power consumption listed. The statement ""Doesn't consume much power but will heat a good-sized portion in approx. one hour."" is not an accurate description of its power consumption. I know that appliances that generate heat require significant power, but I was hoping it would not exceed the 125W maximum rating for my car. The sticker on the bottom states 144W. I had to send it back. I am giving it a three stars because I don't know how it would have functioned if I could have tested it. The quality was good except the power cable is too thin for the power consumed. I have found that 12V heating appliance cords are too thin for the power required to generate the heat. Manufacturers should at least double the diameter of the wire used for these appliances. How much can that cost to improve quality and safety?"

The red medium is the same as the large white (women's). The blue and black mediums are smaller than the large white/medium red. These do not have a cotton crotch and the material is very thin, like pantyhose (in fact, they run easily and have to be treated delicately and washed in detergent without any bleach whatsoever), so they leave absolutely nothing to the imagination. I don't recommend getting these too tight, especially if you're riding a bike because they are so thin that as you bend over, there's no privacy whatsoever. Again, they are very comfortable and I love them, but I wish the material were more durable. They are priced correctly, I think."

PROS: Durable, affordable, rolls nicely on pavement, easy to install and remove. CONS: Heavy, but that's expected for a steel bead, puncture-protected tire at this price point. My main complaint is these tires are not true to size. I observed this on my last set of Cityrides. They were marketed as 700x32, but I measured them at 29mm in width (inflated to 80psi on Alex DA16 rims). On my second purchase, I wanted to go wider, so I ordered a set in size 700x37. After mounting them on the DA16's and inflating to the max 70psi, I was disappointed to discover that they only measure 32mm in width, a full 5mm narrower than advertised."

However, we play frisbee with quick line-drive throws at high speeds and this frisbee kills your hands if you catch a fast pass. I ended up taking a utility knife to the led and used double-sided adhesive tape to glue it to my spare white ultimate frisbee. It added a little extra weight to my frisbee but it was still a hell of a lot easier to catch than the skylighter but half as bright (which is still really bright). I wouldn't say it was a waste of money, but I basically bought a $15 led for another frisbee lol."

510393,0,"I have been looking for a good affordable mattress for a long time now. I still haven't found one. They're going for $800 and more. Too steep for me. So, I've been getting by with inflatable mattresses. They are surprisingly durable and comfortable, too. I have averaged about six or nine months for a typical Intex mattress. Well, I'm hoping it's only temporary. I have bought several of these Intex mattresses with built in air-pumps.Some pumps have been better than others. I ordered this ""Prestige"" model without realizing that it can ONLY be inflated by the battery operated pump. The fill attachment is deeply recessed and cannot be reached by other pump types. I could not even attach a hand-pump I have, with tape. The attachment is slippery and recessed, making this unworkable.To inflate the bed I was forced to use the included battery powered air-pump. This requires no less than six C-sized alkaline batteries. Not having any, I was forced to go to my local 7-11 (not famous for bargain pricing), and buy three sets of alkalines at a cost of $15. Imagine, over half the price of the bed for batteries just to inflate it.Regarding the pump, I must admit it worked astonishingly well. It produces a high-pitched whine like a car-vacuum and inflated the bed in about 70 or 80 seconds. Compared with my previous, and exhausting manual pumping, this electric pump is a marvel. If your going to do a lot of this sort of thing, this pump is definitely the way to go. I had assumed that it was a diaphragm pump that recipricated, but no, it's an axial fan design. One caution; because the pump is so fast you could easily overinflate the bed, so close monitoring is advised. Since the fan does the job so fast I suspect the batteries are good for a dozen such mattresses. A good thing considering they're cost. Take note; Amazon has great prices on bulk battery purchases, too. I should mention that the batteries are in series-parallel arrangement for 4.5 volt operation. If you have a suitable power-supply, good for 2 amps or so, and a couple of clip-leads you might avoid the battery issue.My final comment is that after buying several Intex mattresses, I find that this is the only one I find uncomfortable. Here's why; Intex has changed the internal webbing of the mattress to maintain a flat and firm topside even when highly under-inflated. They're other mattress models get ""gushy"" when under-inflated; like a waterbed, and very comfortable. This one is different. Even under-inflated almost to the floor, the top of the mattress feels firm and ungiving. The other Intex beds are MUCH more comfortable. I will certainly order another if needed, and my electric pump will make inflation quick and easy, but the mattress itself can't hold a candle to they're other models for comfort.In short, a great pump---an uncomfortable mattress."

Just make sure you don't drill it any deeper than it should be.I used this site for installation instructions:[...]I rated down as it's not a Tippmann product as the sellers page indicates and the hole was to small. Also because the stock wiggles around the shaft a little. Shouldn't be a problem, but feels looser than I'd want it to be."
98871,0,"I bought this light before I really did the math. All the reviews here say it's great, but everyone seems to use it on flash mode, which I don't like. It's difficult for drivers to gauge the speed and distance of a frantically flashing and blinking light, which is why there are so many laws on the books all over the world banning the mode.So, this has a steady mode, but if I'm doing my math right, two 1000 mAh AA batteries can only light a half-watt LED for a shade over 6 hours. That's not bad, but I like my rear light to be my last resort light that almost never dies. Plus, most of the light is wasted on a very tight beam, making this just a 2-dollar, disposable tail light to any cars not directly behind you and the perfect distance back to be right where you've aimed the beam. I'm going to keep looking for something that will give me a long-lasting, steady glow."
483413,1,"I am a big guy and in anticipation of a trip to Disney World I was looking for a fanny pack that had a long enough belt to fit my waist. Most fanny packs do not have belts that can accommodate people with waists over 44"". I know for many of you who have ordered this the large belt can be an issue because of the excess webbing. One man's pain is another man's pleasure. When I saw that this fanny pack fit waists up to 55"" I ordered it. The price was very reasonable. It varies by color and I'm not fussy about that so I bought one of the least expensive ones in a funky blue. It arrived very quickly and I checked it out pretty carefully. Well made with several compartments. It is larger than a typical fanny pack. It is designed to be carried in the small of your back. When you need to access it you spin it around and remove what you want and return it to the rear. It is well made. The zippers are not cheap and again the overall construction is very good. They have a mesh pad that is on the back of the pack that lay against your back. That is supposed to keep your back cool and less prone to sweating. We went to a fair with it on a test run and it was pretty cool. It is big and not tremendously stylish when worn over a t-shirt or polo shirt with the belt around your waist or worn around your waist under your shirt creating this giant lump hiding under the rear of your shirt. But that is the nature of fanny packs. It also tended to slip a bit so I had to adjust the belt a few times to find the perfect fit (which of course varies a bit sitting vs standing). Once adjusted the webbing kept its sizing. I don't have a ton of excess webbing to worry about so that was not an issue. My only issue with the pack is how to figure out what I will put in what compartment and then remembering it. We plan to pack it pretty full with phones, a camera, extra batteries, map, plastic ponchos, etc. The goal is that my wife doesn't need to take a purse so she can keep her eyes on our 5 year old son. I am pretty sure I won't have an issue on the rides though you have to swing it to the front of course. I will have a better sense of how this works after a week in 99 degree Florida sun and heat and after walking many miles a day. If I can I will post an update."
335220,0,"Pros:-This chick has absolutely no affect, seriously, a completely blank face, ergo video is HILARIOUS. Seriously like watching SNL.-You will definitely lose weight, and quickly, which is a good motivator for most people-You can definitely ""feel the burn"" at least if you're as out of shape as I am!-This is an extremely strict and regimented program, so if you respond well to rules, you will do well.-Food is healthy and delicious. I am honestly surprised by how much I like the food.-I have low back pain and shoulder pain and recently had spine surgery (thus the joy of being incredibly out of shape), these exercises have actually relieved my (office job) shoulder pain and my low back is feeling better too. (I am being VERY careful not to injure myself again.)-It's only 30 days. If I didn't travel, this would completely be a yummy and pretty easy adventure. It's after the 30 days that this will become questionable.-Excellent vegetarian options (although proteins could be more varied than egg whites, soy products and cheese).Cons:-If you travel or eat out for work at all, you will be unable to comply with the diet as there are no substitutions and it's not like ""eat a small salad"" or whatever, the foods are very specific. Not sure what the implications of that are yet.-This lady's lack of affect can also be annoying.-You're looking at a serious time committment, like 3-4 hours a day. The recipes are quite simple, but you're preparing 4 meals a day from scratch and the repeats are spaced out (so you can't make a larger quantity and eat it a few days later). The workout takes about 1.5 hours as well. I work 12-14 hours a day, try to sleep seven and walk my dog for one, that leaves me a bit short of time to, you know, see my husband or friends. (my husband works from home and takes care of most of the dog stuff, so don't yell at me for dog abuse)-This is not that different from how I normally eat (I lied, these portions are way smaller than what I usually eat, and I do like the occasional whole grain), except that I do like to, for instance, use a whole green pepper or head of escarole and eat the leftovers over the course of the week, instead of using two leaves. I am concerned about food waste.-This is definitely not sustainable. If you are a housewife with no children and at least part of your job is to be pretty, then you have your plan here. For the rest of us, I think this is a good tool to drop a few pounds quickly and remember how good those other jeans feel.-The video only covers one side of the body. Would it really have been that hard to do both sides? While learning the moves (I still am), I have to rewind to make sure I'm doing it right. Annoying to stop and rewind.-Like another reviewer, I prefer a few more carbs (whole grains) to keep my brain functioning. There is a decent amount of fruit and carby veg, though, so I don't think you're heading into Atkins territory."
393433,1,"I've been using the rebounder for years. Recently, I decided I wanted to break up the monotony and see what was out there for rebounder videos. (The last time I looked, the field of choice was almost nil.) I was delighted to see some more choices of which the Urban Rebounder series is part.I should admit that I hadn't been exercising a whole lot lately. So, I had to bring myself ""back up to speed"". By that, I mean that I needed to get myself up to my normal level of work-out intensity. Having done that with the use of this DVD as well as other means of exercise, here's my take on this DVD.First off, the workouts on this DVD range in time... more so than I expected. In fact, most workouts of any series tend to keep to a close range of times. Not with this one. The workouts ranged in time from 13 minutes to 31 minutes.Now, that might seem like a short time period in terms of exercise. However if you're not already a regular user of a rebounder, I will submit to you that this is PLENTY. You see, the rebounder works on your whole body by the use of gravity but in a non-pounding way. When you have the downward force as you hit the rebounder mat, this places extra exertion on your body you would not experience in any other form of exercise. No, not even jogging can give you a workout like this. I may not be eloquent in explaining this aspect but trust me. If you're a beginning to intermediate, shorter workouts will be what you need until you get really proficient.That said, I'll comment on each one of these workouts on this DVD.First off, there are 5 workouts in total. 3 are performed by Charles ""JoJo"" Tyler, 1 by Allison Nolan and one by Tracie Finan.1) The Hip Hop Bound was my LEAST favorite workout. It was also the shortest at about 13 minutes. Now, the short time is one reason for this workout falling out of favor with me but... the main reason is the timing used for the footwork. Once you get to bouncing a bit on the rebounder, there's a certain rhythm that you begin to maintain. I found the rhythm of Charles' workout to be too slow to easily maintain and follow. It really annoyed me throughout the workout to the point where I just began going with my own natural rhythm till the video ended. This isn't a workout I'll likely repeat anytime soon.2) The African Bound is another one of Charles' workouts. It, too, is a bit longer workout at approximately 17 minutes. (My times do NOT include the ""intro"" and are only of the actual workout.) The DVD jacket claims this (and the Hip Hop) to be an intense workout. Are these people taking about the same workout I'm using? Apparently not as I found this to be a beginner level workout. (Btw, if the rhythm of the Hip Hop Bound wasn't so ""off tempo"" that would be classified as a beginner level, too.) The footwork I found to be very easy to follow. However once this workout was complete, I did not feel like I got enough. So, I pulled another workout up and did that one.3) The Latin Bound is Charles' final workout on this DVD. It's also the best one that HE did on here. The workout lasts 20 minutes. It's at a slightly higher level of intensity than his previous two. I liked it and will do it, again. On days when I want a ""light"" workout, this will be enough. On my ""heavy"" workout days, I'll combine it with another form of exercise. (For example, I did this one this morning and then went on to walk for an hour with my toddler in the jogging stroller.) If you are a beginner, this single workout will be plenty for you.4) The Ballet Bound with Allison Nolan is my next favorite. It's the second longest workout on the DVD at 23 minutes. I found this workout to be at the level of intermediate to advanced. She uses plenty of ballet moves altered just enough to work on the rebounder. The main reason I label this one at the level I have is because of her heavy use of arms in upper positions. Fair warning: you WILL have sore shoulders, especially, from this workout the next day. This is a terrific cardiovascular workout, too. Allison, herself, is a pleasant instructor... not too boring and not at all cheesy. One drawback for me is that the ballet moves get a little mundane during the workout. (Not in terms of exertion but in terms of interest. I like workouts that are interesting as well as med-high intensity.) Regardless, I will use this workout a great deal b/c it kicks butt.5) The Dance Bound by Tracie Finan is my favorite workout on this DVD, in terms of intensity, time and interest. This workout is an excellent intermediate-advanced level workout and is 31 minutes long. I like this one b/c I can do it over and over again and still find it interesting. Once I get bored with a type of exercise and find no way to liven it up, I tend to drop it for quite a while. So, this is a big factor for me. One comment on the instructor: the first time I did this workout, I thought ""Oh my gosh! This lady is going to drove me bananas."" Tracie is very perky... even a tad cheesy. Since doing this one some more, I've come to find that her manner isn't as annoying as I once thought. However, she will really annoy some people while other folks will absolutely love her. Her style can be that polarizing. For me, I'm middle of the road. She's good enough to keep me interested in the workout and not too over to the top.Oh... one comment to the DVD itself. For some reason, this DVD will NOT play in my 5 year old Sony DVD/VHS combo player. Don't know why. The surface of the disc is clean and free from any marks what-so-ever. So, I think it may be due to the style of recording they did. Perhaps they didn't ""close the session"" when they recorded this batch? Who knows. However, I have a Sony PS2 upon which I am able to play these workouts and for now, that's what I use. The DVD will, also, play on my DVD-R drive for my Dell laptop. So, that's 2 out of 3 and good enough for me. [My other 5-disc Toshiba gave up the ghost recently. I'm sure it would have played on that one b/c it was usually a very forgiving player whereas the Sony combo player is rather picky.]Even so bear in mind that if you have an older or finicky DVD player, this DVD might not play for you. If that happens, there's always the Amazon returns.If/When I get a new DVD-player, I'll update this review with the DVD's ability to play on that machine.Despite any potential player hiccups, I highly recommend this compilation. In fact, I'm looking at more of their DVD's to purchase as I just LOVE variety. So, as I add them to my collection, I'll do my best to post my experiences.HTH! :)"
406205,0,"Not Russell's fault but all reviewers said to get one size larger than you usually wuold, as they are too small otherwise.I usually take a &#34;large&#34; but on recommendation got an XL. Well the XL was too large, and trying to hold them up with the draw string caused the string to break in a couple of days. Also the material quickly started to &#34;pill,&#34; so I would not buy them again in a large. I was tempted to get a large as I liked the elastic cuff & the material is nice and thick, but the pilling killed that notion. Sorry Russell ...."
16681,0,"When the blade is closed, there is very little resistance keeping the blade from being squeezed too far in (such as snapping the blade closed, or putting it in a tight sheath) and causing a flat area near the tip of the blade.This can be avoided by placing the lock bar pivot pin closer to the front of the knife, or by leaving more space between the spring and the blade's closed position, or by grinding the toe of the tang further forward. Its a fairly common problem with poorly-design lockbacks, and Bear & Son seem to have given it no thought.I give it 3 stars because it's a nice looking US-made knife for the price."

163613,1,"I purchased and received eight different knives (in the $12 to $30 range) to see which knife would be best suited to be included in Bug Out Bags I'm building. I was looking for a high quality stainless blade of 5"" to 7"" long, trailing point and medium hollow grind for all around cutting, slicing, and piercing qualities, full tang (exposed between handle scales), large handled for bigger hands, 3 handle rivets on either high end laminate resin or hardwood handle scales, well balanced,sharp out of the box, and a good high end nylon or leather sheath. Of the 8 knives I purchased, the Schrade Deerslayer is a clear standout. It meets all of the criteria I set out to find and, I beleive it will perform well and, last a very long time if properly used and care for. I would have to say, this knife is a bargain and stacks up to knives costing $70,$80, or more."
365446,1,"Fairly simple to assemble. Weighs a good amount (About 100 pounds). So was a little difficult to get the box upstairs initially. The wheels make it very easy to move around once put together. The bike is pretty compact if you need it to be. The seat and seat back seem like they would be the most likely part(s) to break. Not that they will, but I worry about it. I doubt they would hold the weight of the device if you were to move it by putting pressure on the seat or the seat backing. For something that cost this much I would think they would have made that part a little more heavy duty. Overall a great buy though. Just make sure to buy a battery charger and rechargeable D batteries (Since it does not come with any in the box)."

462651,0,I'm on my third Fast Draw knife now. I like them but they don't last like they should which is surprising for anything from Gerber. I have other tools from them that are excellent. And this knife is great for about 2 years. After that the opening mechanism gets gritty and noisy and I start to wonder just how secure it is. I have had these knives open in my pocket many times also. That's not a good feeling especially if it's new and sharp. Speaking of new and sharp I can keep these knives very sharp for about a year then they start to go downhill. After about 18 months they get to where it's hard to make them sharp and by 2 years they will barely cut a plastic bag. And I don't abuse my knives. I never cut anything that I shouldn't be cutting.For the price it's not too bad to just replace these knives after a while. Overall I've been pleased with them but I do wish they were more durable. I'm looking for another knife now and I'll probably try something different this time. I'm tired of having to buy a new one every two years not so much because of the money but more because of the hassle of having it not be sharp for a while and having the mechanism not work so well after a while.
114628,0,"These are cut a little big, and that's pretty typical for a rain jacket. It feels rubberized to the touch, and does keep you very dry. There are air vents under the armpits small enough that they should't let water in-- great feature. There are also two huge pockets on the front to keep items you need to keep dry.The only thing I don't like about this jacket is that it makes a lot of plastic noise. If you're out in the rain, this doesn't matter, but any time it's not raining you're going to be ""loud"".If I am going to be wearing a jacket for rain purposes I would personally prefer the Columbia Omni-tech or Titanium Tech jacket. Far more stylish, quieter, and better ventilation, at more cost."

302639,0,"I recently got into the whole P90x craze after hearing about it for so long. I'm not following the program religiously but I use it to supplement my gym workouts. The workouts on P90x are challenging, I thought I was in good shape but I got winded pretty quickly. They have some great new moves that I've incorporated into my routine and I feel my muscles working again, so hopefully I'll be able to bust through the plateau I've been in.My complaints are;1)Tony Horton talks WAY too much, he spends too much time babbling about nonsense (""what do you think of my shirt?"" etc etc) and2) because he babbles so much, the workouts drag longer than needed and there are for the most part, he doesn't give too much instruction. I found myself very lost doing the P90x plus Kenpo as he did not give any explanation on how to perform the moves.It would be beneficial to have a feature on the DVD that allows the user to choose the intensity of the workout and then it would show the person who is performing the move (i.e, if you're working out with bands, you would only see the person who is performing the exercise with the bands). There are a few yoga dvd's out there that have this feature and it is really useful.I'd give it 5 stars but screaming at the TV STFU a few times, while Horton was talking nonsense, kicked it down a notch."

311126,1,"This is my second Polar Bear Cooler. I loved my first one so much that I ended up getting one more in a smaller size. The 24 Pack was perfect for those family day trips where I needed to supply drinks for more than just a few people. However, for the everyday usage the 24 Pack was a little too large (about the size of a small duffle bag). I decided to pick-up the 12 Pack, for those occasions where I want to bring my lunch to work or just a couple beverages for after a workout. I must admit that I wasn't too sure about the size of the 12 Pack, but after the quality and performance of my 24 Pack I just figured I can't go wrong. I was correct. Flattened in the packaging it looks kinda big, but once you shape it out, it's roughly the size of a thick briefcase. I really like the size and the performance is just like it's bigger brother. It's made of the same type of material as the 24 Pack and has the same thickness in the insulating walls (I guess-timate about 1-1/2"" thick). I am a fan-boy for life and would definitely recommend this cooler to someone looking for performance, style, quality, and durability."
287682,1,I got this Compression top to wear as a base layer for when riding my motorcycle when its still cold outside. Works great for that purpose.

139936,0,"This is not a cheap bench, so I was expecting greatness. Now I feel a little let down.Pros: Adjustable, comfortable, and seems like it will hold up.Cons:1. The product I received is different than the product pictured on Amazon. Check Powertec's website. Powertec should have different models for their Utility benches. So far, I can find three distinctly different models of their P-UB bench (the one I got, the one pictured on Amazon, and the non-decline model).2. The was some minor damage in shipping (a.) small tear in seat pad, b.) scratched frame)3. The side handles (presumably for leg exercises) get in the way, but they are apparently optional.4. The installation instructions are lacking. The assembly photos were ""okay"" - enough for me to follow but I could see were other people would have problems.5. Usage instructions are non-existent. Completely. Why does the base of the bench have two positions? Should I always screw in the pin lock when using the bench? Is it okay to tighten the pre-assembled bolts to get rid of some of the wobble?Overall, I do see myself using the bench without problems, but I am dissapointed in several aspects."

40346,1,We received the elliptical quickly it came well packaged with no damage to any of the parts. Assembly was easy allthough some of the screws were difficult to tell one from another and there was not enough grease in the little bubble pack they supply I substituted bearing grease. Once assembled add 4 AA batteriers and everything worked. Have been using it daily for a month now easy on the knees can really feel the burn in my thighs after 30 min routine. One negative is the upper handles seem a little to far forward causing me to lean forward while using them giving me some tightness in my lower back after a good workout I may try to reverse the handles so they don't keep my arms and hands quite so far out in front of me. So far seems well built and great price for home use. I would recomend it to others.

24832,0,"So, I noticed a lot of people are having the problem where you take the cap off the handle, and then try to feed the end of the rope out of the back of the handle; but the metal clasp is too big to fit through the plastic. I used a flash light and saw that there was no way it was coming out in one piece. I had this happen, and I pushed and poked and prodded, and here is what finally worked for me.NOTICE: If you break your rope, or cut it too short, I take no responsibility. This method worked for me but your mileage may vary...1. Take the black plastic cap off one of the handles (the end with no rope coming out of it). You do not unscrew it like the package says, just pop it off with a small screw driver. You only need to take off one cap.2. Try to feed the end of the rope out so you can grab it, cut it, adjust it, etc. If it becomes stuck, go to step 3. If you can easily slide the end out, go to step 7.3. OK, so right now you are mad that the metal clasp is too big to come out. Lay the handle on the ground, and place your foot on it. (I laid it on the carpet and used my sock, not a shoe, to avoid damaging the foam.)4. While looking away from the handle, and making sure no one is in the blast zone, strongly pull on the rope. This will slide the rope free from its clasp and separate it from the handle.5. The metal clasp, should come out of the open end of the handle, now that the rope is not attached to it. Note that there is also a washer inside the handle, the washer will not fit/fall out.6. After you have the clasp removed from the handle, feed the rope back into the bearing, the way it was before you pulled it out. It is very important that you thread the bearing AND the washer that is inside the handle. This took me a few tries, and I found the best was was to hold the handle vertically, so that the bearing was at the top, and the open end was at the bottom. The washer will be laying across the opening in the center of the handle. If you look up into it, you should be able to see where the rope is and hopefully ""thread the needle"" so to speak.7. Keep feeding it into the handle until it comes out the open end.8. Stand on the center of the rope, and adjust the length until the tips of the handles touch your armpits. This should be the correct length. You can really use whatever feels comfortable though.9. After using the handles to measure, pull another 4 inches of rope out, to offset the length of the handle. (Since the end of the rope will slide back into the other end of the handle.)10. Double check your measurement and cut the rope.11. If you did not already remove the metal clasp, use a pair of pliers to bend it until it comes free from the amputated piece of rope.12. Use pliers to expand it a bit, so you can slide it onto the freshly cut rope.13. Use pliers to compress the clasp onto the rope. I squeezed it quite hard.14. Pull the center section of rope, to bring the end of the rope inside the handle. If you had a rope where the collar was too large / wouldn't fit, you may need to pull a little harder.15. Put the black plastic cap back on the handle.16. Do some test jumps to make sure the rope is the correct length, spinning properly in the bearings."

The seat stays (diagonal frame members from axle to base of seat) are too thick for the clamps to go around.2. Even if the seat stays were thinner, the rear derailleur cable runs down the right side seat stay and the clamps would interfere with it.3. To mount to the seat tube, I would have had to remove my quick release seat bolt and replace it with the included bolt. However, the bolt included was too thick to fit in the seat clamp and the quick release did not have enough extra length to attach this seat.With all this said, I ended up installing it on my wife's bike, a vintage Schwinn women's frame bike. It fits fine on this bike with no issues. The bike has thin seat stays, a seat post clamp with a large enough hole and no derailleur or other cabling to get in the way. The foot guards are very cheaply made and the attachment ties included are worthless. I ended up attaching the guard with zip ties.Altogether, an inexpensive seat that will suffice on older bikes.For my bike, I ended up ordering the CoPilot TaxiCoPilot Taxi Bicycle Child Seat, which mounts to the built in rack mounts on my frame."

The Paracord does not fit very easily around the hook and the head of the stake is rather small; not very good for driving them into the ground. They are also too narrow...wider is better with the plastic stakes.Coghlan's 9309 9"" Abs Tent Pegare much better and more durable. They are much better quality and I have used them many times with great success.To sum up, at the end of the day there are better quality stakes out there for just a little more money. However, they will work in soft soil if you can't jump to spend the extra few bucks."

358464,0,This stand appears to be sturdy and is super easy to set up. The hammock I originally had on it would cause the whole stand to tip over in a moderate wind (10 mph). It would probably be more suitable for a string/rope hammock that did not have so much wind resistance. The jury is still out on how it holds up being out in the damp southeast Texas weather.
491200,0,"We decided to try these bottles on a hot day. Big mistake. I guess since metal is such a good conductor of heat, the water warmed up very quickly. I tried adding crushed ice to the water but it really didn't make much of a difference. I'll save them for use during the winter months."

375623,1,"Medline AngelStat scrub pants are the best scrub pants I have been able to find since Crest went out of business and became impossible to find. With breathable material (even though they are 45% polyester), I never get uncomfortably hot and sweaty. My scrub pants take a beating, but do not have holes and have shown little to no wear and tear. Perhaps it was the brands I purchased previously, but I have had issues with dark color bleeding out when being washed and even when wearing them while sweating. This was not the case with these scrubs-and I purchased two very dark navy blue pairs, the color did not bleed in the wash, or on my skin and they are still a vibrant navy blue.Even the draw strings are positioned very well-in the past I have lost draw strings in my pants or they have come out, I do not see this happening ever with the drawstrings. The drawstrings do adjust very well and have been able to synch in the waist, however the strings are not cloth so I do have to readjust a couple times a day due to stretching. After wearing these pants for a months, the strings have not frayed whatsoever-something that usually happens with non cloth strings.The only complaint I have is about the sizing. I understand the size chart provided, and that these are unisex scrubs-but I still feel they run big. With most scrubs I am a medium to large-(usually women's size 8-10 in pants). However, I purchased a large and medium pair and the next set I buy will probably be a medium or small. The description said they are 55% cotton (45% polyester) so I expected them to shrink a little-but they did not. My advice is to buy the size you are-do not estimate bigger.The description also says these are reversible-but because of the place where the tag and seams are positioned, I have a hard time believing anyone would reverse these.I do not work in the medical profession, but I do have to wear scrub pants for my outdoor job-so I cannot speak about the needs of people in the medical profession. However, I highly recommend these pants and will definitely purchase more!"

119408,0,I love this lantern for it's very bright light and it is incredibly easy to use. The only downside is that it has no other options besides batteries to power it and it can get pretty pricey to buy it D batteries if you use it alot.

I'm sending them a copy of the Amazon page to show them what I ordered..."
422613,0,"I purchased this product based on the reviews others have left. I had a Danner boot zipper to compare against.This product is 1/4 the price of the Danner product, which is about all it has in it's favor.Pros on this product: Seems to work OK. Easy on, easy offCons:* Made of PVC, not leather, so it doesn't seem to flex very well. Will likely crack in a short while.* Doesn't ship with laces like the Danner product did* Holes don't align with my boots. This is about 1 inch shorter than what it needs to be. I wear size 9.5 boots, so fairly standard. (Standard size is 9 at the Nike factory)* Because the holes don't align properly, it doesn't fit properly, and I can't get the boot as snug as I like it.* Zipper doesn't stay up, especially if I kneel down or put any stress on it.Bottom Line:This works OK if you are just going in and out of the house a lot and need to take off your boots when you come in to avoid tracking mud. I wouldn't install this on a pair of boots that I expected to be walking in all day, as it makes the fit uncomfortable."
16426,0,"I own a full face helmat similar to this. Now i belive that no matter how much you spend on a full face helmat its worth it. I have had mine for about 3 years. And i love it to death. I'm an avid mountain biker. I try to trail ride 4 to 5 days a week. My helmat has saved my face so many times I cannot keep track. Without it i probaly wouldnt be here. Just last firday I crashed into a black berry bush going 30 mph+. My only complaint/ sugestion, is that it depends on how much and how hard your ride your bike. Yes these types of helmats make you feel indestructable. But they get outragously HOT. THe hot air that comes out goes straigh into your face (because of the mouth gaurd) or right into the top ot the helmat. Now im not trying to discourage you. Full face helmats are the best thing to hit the biking world. But just make sure the helmat you choose has room for you to breath and pleanty of air hole in the top."

Fair warning though, if you are looking for a something that is as compact as a regular dumbbell then go buy a set of regular dumbbells at over twice the price of these. While bulkier than a normal dumbbell once you use these a few times you get used to the size and it's not an issue.

379791,1,"The Telrad finder helps me find objects in the sky in a big hurry. Instead of looking at an upside image of a small part of the sky with the finder scope, the Telrad gives you a bigger picture of the sky that you can quickly train your scope on with the red circles displayed on the glass screen. I mount the Telrad on my 4.5"" Reflector with an equitorial mount. Normally it is a pain to find stuff in the sky looking thru the spotting scope and having to deal with the strange axis created by the equitorial mount. With the Telrad, it is kind of like training in on objects with an Etch-a-sketch.I also made some circles on transparency sheets to use with my sky charts making the device even more valuable for finding fainter objects in the sky.Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and it has tremendously increase my productivity while star gazing."

304516,1,"I ordered this watch sight unseen at 11:00am. It arrived in Phoenix from Dallas by Fedex the next morning. It is nice to know that there are still companies that offer this level of service. Thanks Watchzone for the beautiful watch.As for the watch itself, I've only had it for a few hours. Here are my first impressions: It is massive and manly, made of highly polished stainless steel with a dark blue face and a rotating blue and red bezel. A Diver's watch, it is rated for immersion in saltwater to 200 meters. It is automatic and so no battery is needed. The luminous paint used on the hands and hour marks is not tritium but a glow-in-the-dark paint that Seiko claims will glow for 5 to 8 hours after 10 minutes exposure to bright light. This is the only feature that I have a problem with. The price was the lowest I saw on the internet with some venders asking up to seventy five dollars more. The watch came discreetly and securely packed in a Fedex box with the original Seiko jewelbox with pillow and a three year warranty card."

I have never had this kind of exercise machine before but knew I wanted an air rower instead of a piston style as I need to be careful of my shoulders and rotator cuff. Because you are pulling towards you instead of to the side of you it works great.My husband set it up rather quickly and I was ready to go.This machine does exactly what I wanted it for. Strengthen my arms, back muscles, legs and abs. An all around exercise.I read other reviews before I purchased and felt the low price was good for what I needed. I am 5'2, weigh 125 lbs and hope to go down to 115. I have been using for almost a month and have seen a difference already. I work out 3 mornings a week before work doing a different exercise 2 days a week.I highly recommend to anyone my size. Can't tell you about anyone heavier although it is rated up to 225. (My husband is off limits to it). It isn't perfectly quiet, but I am able to watch the morning news and hear it.The only thing that would have been better was if it was packaged better.

After one wearing they each developed huge holes in the ball of the foot area. I sent an example to customer service and was told that after the owner of Thorlo examined the socks, he determined that there must be something wrong with my son's foot or his shoes. They sent me 2 complimentary pairs which hardly made up for the at least 20 pairs of $14 socks that I had to throw in the garbage after one wearing and they also tried to cajole me with their Southern accent and calling me ""Hon"". There is absolutely nothing wrong with my son's foot or his shoes. He is a normal 12 year old boy who walks, runs and plays sports. I was under the impression that Thorlo socks are for these purposes. Very disappointing socks and customer service. I may also add that in addition to their crummy socks and customer service they informed people that there was a security breech on their website so I had to cancel my credit card. Goodbye THORLO!!!"
263452,1,Bought this classic styled watch several years ago for my husband. He loved it but then our oldest son discovered it and Dad kindly gave it to him.

Once it dries on shaft you cant spread it. The body heat from your fingers in enough to soften the product so it can be applied. I use this method then quickly i use a cut off section off an old white tee to apply and spread. I then let the product ""harden"" and remove it with a separate piece of cloth.

Well, until the xs that is.On first inspection I was wondering how they would work in the chain tool on the smaller model. Simple, make it a dongle. A separate unit that I guess is supposed to fit in the case lose at the bottom.Problem: Cold, dark, on the road, need a tool. Pull out tool with numb fingers and long gloves on. Open case, pull out tool just to have the chain tool dongle fall out and bounce into the ditch somewhere never to be found again.Also, I would assume in reaching their XS stature it doesn't provide tire irons (as opposed to the II). So now I have to make sure to carry a set of those as well. Sort of eliminates the advantage of having the xs model, in my opinion.The XS, on the other hand, is as I would have expected for quality. It's well made and what it does provide is well thought out. I just don't think they need to be attempting to compete with more minimal, lighter weight options that don't provide the functionality that Alien has been known for. There are plenty of those less capable tools to choose from."

I don't find the ""resistence"" button really makes a huge difference. The first video is really basic, but it does give a routine for a good start. This doesn't strike me as the machine to create a big difference in inches, but it seems to be helping with basic toning. I don't feel a real big effort from the exercises, but they do help. The good thing about it, is I can expand on my time on the chair, and that increases the results. The video is pretty cheesy - they could have selected and filmed with a little higher quality, but it gives a good beat to stay motivated."
465934,0,"This is an accurate compass. However it is about 3 times the size I expected. It is not constructed from robust materials. The sighting notch and blade are too low and therefore useless. Despite the very large size the degree marking and numbers on the bezel are tiny and difficult to read in daylight. In any low light condition it is completely unreadable. This compass comes with a suction-cup mount for automobile use and perhaps in such a use the enormous size would not be a hindrance. I have not attempted to mount this on a vehicle, but I suspect that it is not robust enough to withstand the bumps and jolts of off road use. I would definitely put this compass in the ""toy"" category. It is not for the serious sports-person or navigator."

I was a air soft beginer before I got this gun and i still am but i thought 25 to 30 bb's would be a lot of ammo for a clip and boy was i wrong i usually use semi auto and those bb's do fast . so i would recommend buying another clip that will hold more bb's. well for the most part it's a good gun.well that about sums it up.

434608,0,"Let me start by saying that I got this table as a Christmas present. I hadn't played foosball for 10 years, but used to play quite a lot. I had never played on anything but a Tornado table, and this is definitely not of that quality.Pros:1. Relatively inexpensive. You won't find a Tornado for this price.2. Heavy. The table is stable, even with fairly aggressive play.3. Sturdy. The legs are not going to break off, etc. Men also seem durable, as do the rods.4. The playing surface is painted with a flat paint. A slick surface would ruin the game.5. Despite all the negative opinions about rubber grips, I really like these. They are really solid, and are very tight against the rods. No chance of them slipping.Cons:1. The bearings are sloppy. There is a fair amount of play(1/16""?) between the outer rod diameter and the inner bearing diameter. This has less of an impact than I thought it would on average play, but it does bother me. Advanced moves that involve precision and quick spinning will be impacted.2. The balls are trash. They are molded with cute bumps to make them look like soccer balls, rendering them useless for play. Fortunately, you can buy good balls readily from Amazon for cheap.3. The assembly instructions are miserable. There are a few parts (the table end caps, for example) that are completely left out. Again, not a big deal since it won't impact the performance of the end product, but a bit of an annoyance. It reminds you that you are buying a bargain table.4. There are a few spots that you will need to pre-drill to get pieces to assemble - the ball drop cups, for example. Not mentioned in the instructions, of course.5. Overall, pretty cheap construction. Completely made out of low quality (but thick) particle board. No real wood anywhere, no plywood, only flaky cheap particle board.6. Floor is pretty thin - 3/8""? It seems like it may suffice, but I'm pretty sure I will find that there are a few low spots once I get round balls to really test the table. Could be remedied with 1/2 a day in a garage, gluing strips of oak to the back, but again, why should you have to do this? If minor low spots don't bother you, then no big deal.7. Balls get deposited on the ends of the table. Nice to have them arrive on the sides, since that's where the players stand.8. The men are severely not-counterbalanced. When turned on their side (a must for playing 1-1 games), they quickly drop back down. I will fix this by installing my own counterweights, but quite a hassle. I thought I might be able to balance the men upside down to get them out of the way of the ball (a work-around), but no- the men's heads hit the ball. Not a problem if you always plan on playing 2 vs. 2.9. Many of the parts (rods, bearings, men) are not compatible with parts used on Tornado tables. I considered replacing the men with Tornado counterbalanced men, but the mounting methods are different.10. Leveling is done with shims. No threaded height adjustments here.So all-in all, a reasonable table for the price. Don't fool yourself into thinking you've found a low cost Tornado quality table though! I would recommend considering shopping around for a gently used Tornado at a similar price."
506330,0,"It's beautiful. I loved it when I first got it and put it together. But once the toys got in there and challenged the sides, the bolts kept coming out. It is very poorly designed. So we took it apart and use it as wall decorations. Not recommended."
430201,1,"I fully admit that I was stronger when I was 21. I'm 30 now, but I still lift weights. Considering this, I still believe this racquet sacrifice's some power/speed for accuracy. That's fine. I like it. It's extremely durable. I read some other reviews about the plastic top (plastic or rubber covering the metal part of the racquet) sometimes breaks. SO WHAT. Do you buy a racquet because it's pretty? There are some nice pink ones available at Dicks... In any case, that has not happened to me and I've banged it against the wall several times trying to get wall hugging shots. I guess I've owned it for about six months and it still looks new to me."

81683,2,"I purchased this watch to monitor my aerobics workouts. It worked fine testing it prior to my work out. I checked my heart rate between each song to make sure I was working in my 'target zone'. The first 3 checks read fine, then it stopped working completely. The heartrate just wouldn't register. I tried wetting my fingers, drying my fingers, nothing. When I got home after the workout, it worked fine.It's also very thick and hits my wristbone uncomfortably."
394811,0,"We really enjoyed playing with this ball although it made a lot of noise rolling on the floor. We rolled it on carpet to reduce the noise, but still a lot of rattling from the ice inside. We forgot that you have to stop and stir your ice cream occasionally and it only froze around the outside of the cylinder. We had more of a milk shake when we were finished. I imagine openning it repeatedly would get a little messy.This is certainly not for making lots of or very creamy ice cream. However, it is lots of fun and took me back to the days of making ice cream in coffee cans rolled across Mom's kitchen floor. This is a lot of fun for families. Makes enough for a family of 4 to share for a treat. Just don't plan on watching a movie while rolling your treat.Good time. :)"

284025,2,"This tent is simple to construct and offers great space. However, on our second trip out both of the elastic ropes inside of the two main suspension rods/poles broke. The break was not a result of rough handling or poor storage. We purchased the tent about a month ago and have used it only twice. The tent is also missing one of the loops to hang the 'wall' inside the tent.Eureka will replace the poles, but we have to pay shipping. Not too happy with the product or the company."
419864,0,"I love this brand of shorts which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, I misunderstood the description and when I click on different links to the item, it changes from Juniors to Girls. I understood Juniors to mean teenage girl age. As a 20 year old girl, I can easily wear a M/L in these shorts for Juniors/adults. When I got my package, I received a Youth Large instead. I had to give the shorts to someone else who could wear them because I needed them on a time crunch. This is a good brand, just a little confusing on the description."

Since there is no classification to what type of vehicle this is, and after hrs of contacts with the DMV and other agencies, this scooter doesn't have any classification for use.Everyone I come in contact with loves it and wants to know more. Easy to handle and bolts right along when fully charged. My niece even put it together in less than 1/2 hr and the battery was fully charged in just over 2 hrs. For the price, I don't think you can beat it. And, after I get after these ""moron"" code enforcers in my area to ""lighten-up"" I should be back to tooling around and being Fully Independent"" again."
476401,2,"I purchased 5 of the Anvil SS Henleys in assorted colors not long ago. Out of the box, they were good quality. After 2 washes, however, they have shrunk drastically to the point that they cannot be tucked in anymore. My personal opinion... waste of money."
244700,0,"I don't like writing bad reviews, but people should know. The yellow one with the white chest strap does NOT come with the white chest strap. It's the same as the orange. The main reason for my 3 stars is that I have written to the company 3 TIMES to ask for compensation, because they charge $2 more for the yellow for no reason. That was from 3 weeks ago and they are not able to respond. I feel neglected, and annoyed that they false advertise the yellow one. All I wanted was that chest strap because I've used these before and they are more secure with the strap. Anyway, it's a fine vest, and works with a backpack, but I wouldn't want to work with this company again."
266995,2,"I got my socks only a few days after I ordered them, which I was very happy about.. unfortunately,the socks I ordered were the ""Bright Yellow"" to match my softball uniform.. Unfortunately, the ones I received were definitely not Bright Yellow. They look more like the ""Light Gold"" color you can choose from. They look absolutely nothing like the picture shows, and definitely look ridiculous with my uniform. I could have went in to Sports Authority and gotten the same pair, the reason I chose to order them from this site is because I needed the neon. I'm sad I wasted $20 on a pair for my boyfriend and I. I sent in a message hoping to get a refund, since it was not my error. We'll see how that goes."
317848,1,"This is great for what it does. With family constraints, I'm not practicing as much as I need to to keep my caluses in shape. I play at church a few times a month and usually only pull the guitar out of the closet a few days before to start practicing. It often sits unused for 1-3 weeks at a time. In the interim, my caluses get pretty soft. I'm hoping this product can help with that.My only concern is that I'd like a larger version. I have large hands and this doesn't fit well. When I put all 4 fingers on at the same time, they barely fit, and the depth is too small. I use a fat neck on my guitar and this could use at least a 1/2&#34; more thickness. So this isn't like having a guitar neck in your hands, but it does build your caluses. After using it this last week (I keep it in the car and use it while driving to work and back), it's already making a big improvement.I'd recommend this product with the caveat that if you have large hands, it's not going to be optimal for you. But to my knowledge, there is no competing product (the only thing close is the caps for the hand exerciser), and at $7, this is a pretty good buy."
30272,1,I purchased two for my son and my husband. They recently used them for the first time on our trip to the Dominican Republic for my son's wedding. The bag performed with no issues at all. There was plenty of extra storage room so we could add shoes etc that didn't fit in our suitcases. We were on different flights and different airlines and neither bag was damaged. It was so easy to get through the airports with the wheels. We recommend it.
508757,1,"This appears to be well constructed. The rope looks good, the bag is good quality. It's small enough to easily take with you. It's easy to accurately deploy the full length of the rope. I'm very surprised at the quality for the price, I'm happy with this purchase."

156453,0,I purchased the chair for office use and have been sitting on a regular exercise ball prior to my purchase. The ball chair gives you the ability to swivel and move around but the ball is harder/smaller than the small exercise ball and therefore more dense and less comfortable to sit on.

65054,0,"Plain and simple, this is a cheap scooter. Therefore, I didn't expect much from it. I am 24 and I use this in my office to ride around at work. It works fine for that.

98700,1,"I bought this for running, as I just started running and the winter months have made it quite dark out after work. I clip this buddy onto the back of my headlamp band. It's SUPER bright, and I enjoy blinding the other runners during running club. I'm tempted to try some traffic stops with my new bright light. The flash pattern is very different from other lights and makes it really visible. I highly suggest this light to bikers and runners."

101525,0,"I received my scope quickly and I was excited to mount it and go sight it in, but I was frustrated by the mount it came with. I think I got a returned scope, because the cleaning cloth and mount came in a Ziplock sandwich baggy. The mount was broken as far as I could tell, but since there are no directions or even a user manual included I can't tell. I called support, but they weren't that helpful. I think they didn't understand what I meant. I was told the old mount isn't made anymore so they would send me a new ring mount. Okay great! After 2 weeks I haven't received a mount. I did receive the scope user manual in the mail, in an envelope that looked like the unabomber sent it.Anyway the user manual doesn't say anything about the mount so I will have to contact the seller again and see what is going on. At this point I've given up on using this scope during this hunting season."
324299,0,"5 stars for the Ripstik...1 star for the shipping. I ordered a Ripstik for my son's 9th birthday. It was shipped from California to Florida. Thankfully, the Ripstik arrived undamaged. The box it arrived in was another matter. It was crushed and torn almost completely open on both sides of the flimsy box and didn't have any packing materials to cushion the Ripstik at all. The Ripstik was completely exposed...fortunately, all parts and directions were still included and the Ripstik wasn't broken. My son LOVES his Ripstik and has become ""professional"" riding it everywhere."

It has torn to shreds. In fact, the handle broke off the first time I used it. And now the whole side is torn off of the bag.I have been pretty gentle with it, so it's not from rough handling"
57705,1,I have been hearing about this workout out of NewYork for awhile now and was really curious about it when I read that Norma Kamali was devoted to it. Of course I live in Miami so the classes are not available out here. Lo and behold Amazon to the rescue. Perfect timing to start the New Year and as usual I trust Amazon to get it to me at the best price available and no hassel shipping. Thanks guys for shaping up my New Year.
269807,1,"One of my few made-in-the-USA clothing items. I'm not diabetic, but I hate tight socks. I always buy a size larger than recommended. I wear other, thicker sox with my hiking boots.

After trying one pair, I now have 4 white and 4 black."
62343,0,I would not buy this if you're going to use it for mountain biking. Bite valve gets covered with dust and dirt and I end up unscrewing the top and drinking from the bottle without it to avoid eating crud.

284432,0,"I've used the belt around 15-20 times. Already though, the leather has creased a bit near where the prongs go through the holes that I'm using. I suspect that over time the holes will crack and expand into the crease, and eventually tear.I started using a belt a bit too late, only after injuring my back. I'll definitely be using one belt or another from now on. If and when I replace this one, probably sooner than I would have liked, I'll be willing to spend more for something that I think will be more durable."

But the leg straps donot work!Mine unstrap and fly off even on the lowest resistence on the 2nd rep of the excercise!Unless you would like to tie them with another string or use a band instead these may not work. I almost broke my glass door the first time I tried it.I would suggest the manufacturer to use a better locking system to secure the leg straps.Gaurav Mehra
298808,0,"This is a good microphone, but not a great microphone due to the fact that it connects externally to the adapter and produces more noise than the side address Shure USB microphone. If you are wanting XLR specifically this review is not for you. If you don't need it and just want to connect efficiently to a computer alone this is for you.I have been reviewing and testing series of microphones in order to undertake videos, podcasts and put sound onto PowerPoint slides. I would have to say that I was largely misled by some of the online podcasts recommending solutions that use microphones we connect as this one does XLR to mic. The first solution I tried was a Heil microphone attached to an m-audio box and I could not get sound under Windows 64 version 7 to any reasonable level. The M-audio box was fine and came with some excellent sound software called Ableton. This Shure microphone is fine but does produce a bit of hiss. If you want USB my suggestion is that you use the direct side address USB cardioid microphone which I have found excellent and produces a superb sound or you use the Rode USB podcaster. Each have their advantages. And I cannot say that one or the other is a better product.They are both big clunky and I have got attached to the warm sound of both. Both work really well with Dragon Dictate too.I like both and have the Rode on Heil arm with Rode shockmount and use it for powerpoint voice overs that I use for slides in powerpoint and use the side microphone on a stick table microphone hidden for video. It picks up a bit more from the environment. I suspect that the Heil microphone that I had got may have been defective but the reviews do say that it does produce a very soft sound and it was really extremely soft and the whole system does not work well under Windows 7, 64-bit. You could at least hear a Heil with a Apple but it was still very soft and needed compression to use.So if it comes to doing something with a computer directly buy a microphone that has built-in USB and do not do complex connections regardless of what you may hear the advantages. I do think that some of the reviews are biased to commercial products and I would emphasise I have no commercial or other interest in him microphone or microphone company.We are producing sound directly for podcasts and for video and in support of slides patient education and medical education. I want the simplest way to get a good result without fiddling with the sound software and with a video software and I have found the complexity does not add value. I think using an external mike that connects into the sound box comes from people who historically used that old technology and you will end up with two sets of cords and a poor result with more hum and hiss."

All of that being said, it is NOT a 3-man tube, unless the men you're talking about are less than 60 pounds each. We tried to fit three slim 13-15 year olds on the tube, and it was much to small.

166966,0,"This machete is functional but there are a few drawbacks. For one the handle is massive. I am 6'2"" and have big hands and I feel like the plastic grip on this thing is just at the edge of my ability to comfortably hold. Forget using this if you are not a large man. Women and small men need not apply unless you have disproportionately large hands. You will have trouble gripping securely.The other thing is that it comes pretty poorly sharpened. I needed to hone the blade right out of the box. After an hour of hacking at blackberry vines it needs to be properly sharpened with a stone. Seems like they could have taken 5 more minutes to put a nicer edge on it.On the bright side it's pretty much an axe crossed with a machete so you can go through big branches just as well as underbrush."
151931,2,"I bought this tandem rack to replace an older Rocky Mounts rack with the hope that it would make the process of getting a tandem on to a roof top rack easier. Unfortunately I've been very dissapointed. To begin with the cross bars I had on my vehicle weren't wide enough to allow standing the bike up to place the fork into the mount without the chain rings hitting the side of the car. I purchased wider bars which did solve that problem. The rack is designed to swivel out the fork mount, stand the bike on end with the front tire off, put into the mount, then lift the bike and swing it around and drop the bottom tube onto a support. In theory it's supposed to be a one person operation, but my experience as a 5'8"" person is forget it. Even with my wife assisting by pushing the swivel fork mount back inward it was very difficult to set the bike down onto the support for the bottom tube because the chains get hung up on it. This requires lifting the bike quite high and using my hands to keep the chain from catching. Then the weight of the bike sits on the cables which are routed along the bottom of the tube. Finally placing the two straps over the bottom tube to secure it is a major pain as well. I can actually only get one of them on with the geometry of our bike, and the other again requires handling the chain. I have ended up with chain grease on my hands, shirt, and shorts every time we've used it. This rack is quite expensive and poorly designed in my view. Fortunately we purchased it from REI and even though we've been using for about a month they will take it back. I'm going to look at the updated Rocky Mounts tandem rack, the Thule tandem rack or simply stick with our old rack."
350662,1,"As my title states, these are not your typical cheapo dumbell handles. They are one solid piece of steel that has been drop forged. Most cheapo dumbbell handles typically are hollow or maybe the handles have been mis-matched in sizes. In Addition, some might a two piece construction with a sleeve &#34;welded&#34; over a solid bar, and with any luck the flux and weld will not fail to hold the weights while you are performing skull crushers. The knurling on the handles is just enough for a good grip while not cutting into the skin. Myself - I wear gloves - so as to protect my skin as well as protecting my equipment for long term. The locking collars do have the gaskets on them to help tighten the plates securely, but if you know how to tighten weights correctly, they are not really needed. They also have deep threads so they are secure in holding and would not &#34;skip&#34; off the handle. If you want to keep safety high on your list as I do, then invest in a pair of handles that will not fail on you. On the other hand, if you NEVER plan on lifting any weighted dumbbells above your head, then you might get by with a set of cheapo dumbbells that could possibly fail and fall onto your foot or other parts below your head. However, just remember that it is YOUR safety at stake. Isn't that worth just a few bucks more? Happy Lifting!"
154174,1,This mat is a good bargain and perfect for the casual pilates partaker like myself. Rolls up nicely and the velcro should strap makes it easy to transport or store away.

This obviously raises the possibility of seatpost bending / failure since it wasn't designed for this.3. The most significant problem - BY FAR - is that the tension settings don't go very high. Scale of 1-8, I havent cycled in years and I get a casual workout at 5. Legs get strong - fast. I can see myself on 8 in a couple months and then what? Ankle weights?Bottom line: If your a tall man or a serious cyclist forget this thing. If your a woman, it might be perfect for you.Update: after several months the bike has failed, and its so heavy that shipping it for repairs is not worth it to me. The threads on the crank where the pedals insert have stripped, so the pedals now flop onto the floor. It might be possible to repair with some very thin nuts, by drilling out the threads and rigging a new set of pedals, or with a weld, but this piece can no longer be recommended to anyone."
348846,1,"It works excelent! I pumped air only twice in the beggining, and already tree month don't need to touch. I was sitting on ball two week, I started feel pain in my low back, so I decided not to sit all day, but do some excercise during the day. It makes my work cube more fun at work :)"

481640,0,"This knife comes with a very nice blade, It holds an edge well. The spring assist opening works well. The handle is very tiny in my hand and the blade is even smaller. It works great for opening packages, but I don't think it would work well for a daily carry."
61349,0,This bottle works as expected - thought it takes more suction than I would expect for a full draw of water. The compact size fits well in a water cage on the bike and is a good volume for short rides.The 3 stars is simply because it is hard to be too excited for a water bottle.
297435,0,"Personally I found the hard copy book quite unnecessary since it comes with a DVD illustration of how to do the moves...So u don't really need to read the book. Apart from that, the exercise program is great. I love the Dancing section. It's easier to do than those in traditional TA dancing DVDs.And yeah...I wonder who would really follow the diet plans ?!! I don't ! It's too much trouble to cook day-by-day meals like that (especially for only 1 person), except when u have someone else to do all the grocery shopping and cooking for u !"
452465,0,Bought this for my 11 year old who always has trouble with straps and closings on previous watches. This one just clips onto the wrist and it has stayed on ever since. The bright color is attractive.It claimed to be the easiest watch in the world to set the time and date etc but I had trouble manipulating the hour / minute sequence and finally gave it up to someone else.Would recommend this watch for preteens / teens who want something practical and trendy at a good price.

311481,0,Classic design but very small scale. I have a smallish face but these sun glasses feel like they are proportioned for a child. Wish I had ordered the black rims so the frames would blend more and hopefully appear a bit bigger.
480509,1,This banner is made of high quality material. It's perfect for any fan. I am very happy with this purchase.
404450,1,"This is my second pair of Old Macs. I love them for those rides where the ground is just a bit too rocky to be comfortable for my otherwise barefoot horse.My only complaint is that these boots arrived with a kink/fold in the inner flap that surrounds the hoof wall. This made the boots extremely difficult to secure once on. They rubbed a bit on the hoof wall that first ride, but the kink worked itself out and is no longer an issue. I'm very relieved about that as I probably would not use them at all if the kink had stayed."
50762,1,This item came in a short amount of time and am pleased with my purchase. This will be a great Christmas gift for my daughter.
71480,0,I bought this item for my 14 ft Jon boat and it works on the lakes and such but wouldn't take it out on the river with the current. It is a cheap anchor for a cheap price and would be more fitted for a pwc like a wave runner under the seat. Works for what I need but once it breaks (and it will) I will be buying something else. The item has a lock ring that allows it to expand and it feels cheaper but for the money its good.
66694,1,"Saturday night, 6/27/10, I was out fishing with my buddy, and I was wearing the everyready 3-led headlight. To make a long story short, we were in the Long Beach Harbor, and as we went across a channel opening, we got hit by a big wave, and capsized. I jumped in cannonball-style, but didn't go under. The lamp, which was on, stayed on my head, and when we swam over to the now upside-down boat, and hung onto it for dear life, I had my buddy, who was prone on the hull of my little 13 foot aluminum skiff, waving the headlamp at a tugboat that was coming out to escort a freighter into the harbor. We were able to get their attention, and after 25 minutes of hanging off the boat in icy Pacific waters, we were pulled aboard a Long Beach Lifeguard boat. If I hadn't been wearing the headlamp, I doubt we could have gotten their attention, as it was about Midnight. I'm quite humbled by the fact that this headlamp was bright enough to catch the attention of a tugboat captain at about 100 yards. I'm getting the headlamp a fresh set of batteries for my new birthday, cause I woulda been a goner without it."
104177,1,This cooler was easy to set up and use. Kept everything cold. Attached two pool float strings that attached to our floats and attached our floats to the dock. about 50 ft and the cooler was the center point. Never had to get out of the water for food and beverages. also put cell phones in zip bags and put them in the cup holders. The perfect set up
426423,0,"I hate the fact that the contents shift so much that it all ends up as a large lump on one side so attempting to keep it pressed against the back or stomach is almost impossible. The heat is also very inconsistant, running very hot at first and then becoming too weak for most of the claimed time. They are still useful, but for my uses BodiHeat brand works far better and for longer."
457261,0,"I bought this because ""the coolest feature is the headphone exit port"" -according to the manufacturer, and I wanted to use it and listen to music when jogging. Well guess what? There isn't one. Or am I missing it? Otherwise, a great little pack, just right for a day's activities."
259597,1,"After more than 30 years in Martial Arts, I've come to trust the quality and durability of Tiger Claw. We get to see gear from many different companies in our Do Jang and Tiger Claw is consistently reliable. We liked this guard because of the spine protection. In multiple on one sparring situations, it has proved extremely valuable. Her older Tiger Claw Professional Chest Protector was perfect, but my daughter is tall and skinny and had outgrown it.PROFESSIONAL CHEST GUARDWhen the Pro Chest Guard arrived, it appeared a bit thinner than the older PCP we had, but not much. Our biggest difficulty was achieving the proper sizing.Her Professional Chest Protector was sized CHS (Child Small). So after visiting Tiger Claw's site for size charts and speaking with customer service, we ordered the Adult Small size Pro Chest Guard. When it arrived, it was barely longer than our CHS protector, though the head opening was larger. The Martial Arts Store was absolutely fantastic about helping us get it right! We eventually wound up with the medium Competition Chest Guard by Tiger Claw because of the collar bone protection.Competition Chest Guard (TC2000)It doesn't have a spine protector, but closes snugly in the back around my skinny kid. If she widens out, we figure we can weave her old spine guard into the slot.The Martial Arts Store truly shines! We had problems with sizes provided TigerClaw. TMAS has worked with us every step of the way: Sending us a number of protectors to try; having us wait to get the right protector first & return the others all together; finding us a better fitting albeit cheaper model. The true test of customer service is adversity. TMAS is patient & wonderful to work with and affordable. They now have all our martial arts supply business. They have more items on their website and an Amazon Checkout so it's like being on Amazon but with a wider selection.So take care with the sizing, both Tiger Claw and TMAS were incredibly helpful with my difficult to size, in-between, oddly proportioned kid. (Most folks don't have as much trouble with that torso:legs proportion.) And your Sa Bom Nim or Sensei should be able to help with that too."
331975,1,"I do use this stuff for my scuba mask. I've also found it useful for my bicycle glasses and swim goggles too. I'm a bicycle commuter so when it's cold outside and I start working up a sweat, my glasses get all fogged up. One coating of this stuff works for about 2-3 days. 4 times a week I ride my bicycle to the pool and swim laps. If I put my goggles on after riding, they fog up right away. This gel prevents that fog too. Why only 4 out of 5 stars then? It seems to me that they could make something that lasts more than just one dive, or two or three bike rides. How about a gel that lasts a couple weeks or a month? Other that that one gripe, this stuff is great."

291426,0,"its a simple metal bottle. yes its bpa free, etc. i appreciate all that.but still, its just a bottle.some issues:1. i expected this to sweat, based on the other reviews, but i noticed it gets really really cold on the outside too. so much so that its something difficult to hold the bottle while you drink from it. i expected there would be some barrier to at least not have that happen.2. sports cap makes a weird high pitched noise when you drink. i thought it was just me, but it turns out other people have reported this too.3. color bottles should NOT be put in the dish washer. i.e. the color will come off. so color ones ARE NOT dishwasher safe. please know this before you buy. i missed this, maybe its noted on the website description...all in all, ill keep the bottle. ill try to find a sleeve or something so that i can drink from it easier..."

175774,2,"I received my trike with high hopes. My bad. The trike was surprisingly to assemble, about 1 1/2 hours, taking my time. After assembly I gave it a test run, and was overjoyed with its having exceeded my expectations. I rode it approximately 1 block, but having family visiting from afar, waited until they left the next morning. Wow, now is the time to give m trike a real run. I did not even get out of the (short) driveway and the pedal just quit working. Here is where my satisfaction took a nose dive. Customer service, at every step, was almost nil. The one human I did succeed in talking with was nasty, and of absolutely no help.I sincerely hope others have a better experience."

157288,0,"The seat is an ok shape for a small or medium bum, but too soft. I would prefer a firm seat as my bum and thigh end up pushing through the material and it digs into my leg...however i much prefer this seat to the traditional style where crotch circulation is cut and body part(s) may become numb! I do not imagine that large bums would prefer a larger platform, although it may be worth a try to lose the saddle with a horn!"

187493,1,The 55CM is a bit small for even short people like myself. I ended up getting the 65CM too. The ball is very durable and holds air well.
356640,0,"I think anybody giving this cot a five star rating is far more generous than I. The canvas is decent quality, but the build doesn't look like it could handle anything but the slightest inadvertent abuse. Within about 14 seconds, the paint was already rubbing/flaking/chipping off the aluminum frame. The picture-free directions are POOR, so let me clue you in, if you're a tall person who wants a cot they can fit on -- this one being capable of fitting that bill. If your cot DOESN'T match the pictures on the box, or the picture in this listing, put the end rod with the hole farthest from the end on --last-- so you have some leverage. Hard to explain without the capability of pictures in the review, but this will make more sense with the item in front of you.The other review says something about ""maybe some thin foam padding"" might help. It'll take a lot more than that to make this sucker comfortable due to the current taughtness of the canvas which might relax over time to make it more livable.Is it more comfortable (as is) than ground outside? Sure. Why not. Is it much more comfortable -inside- than sleeping on the carpet? Not particularly.If you're a tall pup and don't want your feet hanging off the end of a cot, and this is the only game in town due to pets wanting to use infinitely-more-comfortable inflatables as claw toys, then DON'T pay over $50, buy some serious padding, give it a go, and put on the ""overly long"" end connector on -last-.If you have any other options for a snooze, use them instead.And don't put a guest on this thing, unless you hate your guest."
722,2,"I ordered this bed in an emergency situation for my 95 year old mother to sleep on. The bed was easy to fill and evacuate, but it has a slow leak that necessitates adding air to it every day. I couldn't send it back because I would have had nothing for my mother to sleep on."
186052,0,"I wanted to pick up a pair of cheap shorts with pockets for wearing around the house when it's warm. These fit the bill -- they're inexpensive and pull on easily, just the thing for lounging around. Also would be fine for working out in since the pockets are nice and flush to decrease the chance of catching the pocket with your hands if you're running hard. The mesh material is cool in warm weather and feels nice and soft against the skin.However, the cut of the shorts feels odd. I can't quite put my finger on it but it feels like the thighs are too tight or the front is too small; as I move around there's a bit of restriction on movement. Not enough to feel like something might rip, but I definitely feel it whenever I wear these.Still, for $10 shipped, it's a fine purchase."
167877,0,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who is a gymnast. She thinks it is a fine jump rope but unfortunately it is too long.Pros: ball-bearings help to make this a jump rope that is easy to useCons: difficult if not impossible to shorten the length because of the special pin/clamp that seals the rope into the handle. It would have been handy to provide a special tool to do this.

248758,0,"The stove works like a charm. Plastic base holds gas cylinder well, burner top is stable, and the burner produces plenty of heat.

116233,2,"The Adidas flex shirtbands were too small in length. I purchased them for a slender (126 lbs) 5'9"" teenager and they didn't fit except as a tight wristband. Very dissatisfied. Amazon needs to have the vendor add the length of the shirtbands for full disclosure marketing."
16820,0,"I purchased this big wheel for my 3 year old daughter. We already own the Twist big wheel by Radio Flyer, which is a wonderful big wheel, and in my opinion better than this one.I didn't get another since my daughter liked her older brother's (4YO) big wheel low rider part and didn't need the tricycle part, plus we already had one.This was easy for me to put together.It does have a longer leg length than the Twist big wheel so now my son rides this one, and my daughter rides his. My daughter is tall for her age. It is just enough of a length that my daughter isn't comfortable yet. As one other review said, the back of the seat does hurt their back. In fact they both had three bruises on their backs after riding this. My husband ended up wrapping the back of the seat in several layers of duck tape and it has fixed the problem. We aren't sure what part was hurting their back because it isn't obvious, but it is fixed now. So just be aware of that. Overall the big wheel is great and used daily here! Seems very sturdy and the flag is cool.In hind site, I should of gone with another Twist and Trike(?) by Radio Flyer, because I have had it for over a year and that is their favorite (no pain)."
318682,0,"These shorts are the expected great quality that you expect from UA; however, they are a size smaller than most other UA shorts. I had bought a pair @ Dick's sporting good store and knew what size I should get, but once they arrived, I realized too late that they were too small. To be more precise, they are too small in the groin area. I noticed that since I got them that I am constantly pulling and readjusting. I'm not a plus-sized guy, but I would have to order xxx large!Just a warning, be sure you order a size bigger than you would normally wear, or go to your local sporting goods store and double check for comfort.I love UA shorts, but these are just too uncomfortable to wear."

408967,1,"When I initially had this stand under consideration it wasn't price, quality, or durability I had in-mind. I read several reviews about the difficulty of putting the darn thing together. I thought ""Can it really be that hard?"". Well, upon receiving my stand I pulled out the instruction guide with some trepidation. I was pleased to find out that with one thorough review of those instructions, a check of all included items, and digging out a couple of tools to help with the set-up I had no problem assembling the stand in about 45 minutes. No skinned knuckles or overly sore hands either. I don't want to make light of other reviewers and their assembly difficulties. Either I just understand exploded diagrams really well and have that magic mechanical touch or more likely Bowflex revised the assembly guide. So, don't worry about assembly if you're at least a tad mechanically inclined and at least have a few decent tools lying around.My only negative comment about the stand was the manner in which it was packed. A little more insulation or styrofoam would have been nice on each component because I noticed some scuffing and scratches (nothing so terrible as to warrant a return) that really shouldn't be there if a little more care was taken when packing the items.Other than that I'm really happy I spent the extra dollars to get the dumbbells up off the ground. The stand and weights on it look great, my lower back is happy, and the stand works just as advertised."

136880,1,"This was my first pair of Bolle sunglasses. I have owned Bolle skiing goggles in the past but never a pair of sunglasses. I came across these a few weeks back for only 39.99 or in other words around 74% off the MSRP. It isn't often you find a pair of polarized sunglasses from a quality company for so cheap so I pulled the trigger and purchased them. I like having a pair of polarized sunglasses as I am a photographer and it gives me a good general idea of what a polarizing filter will look like in a particular shot. Plus they make great driving sunglasses.Anyways I have been using them for a couple weeks now and I am impressed. I figured there had to be a catch for getting almost 75% off but there isn't. Overall its a great design, they are very comfortable to wear and most importantly they have great glass. I have a smaller face so these are a tad bit big frame wise then again I am just not used to wearing larger framed glasses and my wife says they look great (Trust me she would be the first one to toss these out the window if they looked bad on me so she isn't just saying that to be nice).In all honesty for 40 bucks these things are a steal. If you like aviator style glasses and are looking for a pair of polarizing sunglasses, well you would be wise to give these a look. Its cheap returning sunglasses through the mail so what do you have to lose. I am honestly thinking about getting a 2nd pair."
289594,0,Good and bad for this jacket. First the price is to much. I paid $74.00 but it should have been lower because there is nothing to this jacket. It feels like your wearing a piece of plastic lined with netting. Yes it is waterproof but you better be wearing a flannel shirt underneath or you will freeze.The other good thing i can say about this jacket is the size was perfect. The sleeves are long enough for me as I am 5'8 and it is hard to find a jacket with sleeves long enough.

It would seem the refills only really last one or two nights and then the smell is not so strong and the mozzys come in. Rather than spend money on refills, we may as well shut the window and turn the air on!"

This watch has a nice BIG dial and you can even read the numbers without having to use the light (an improvement from the mudman version). As a pilot I thought it would be neat to have the barometer and altimeter. WRONG, well I guess it is cool to have ""random numbers"" generated, these functions are so far out of wack that it would be impossible to compare them to toys. Don't waste your money. I will use it until the battery dies (which will not be that long with ANY use - (read the small print)), and then look for a BASIC watch. I have learned my lesson."
243863,0,"Russell Athletic Long Sleeve Tees I purchased a few years ago were made of heavy (I mean heavy) material.

354705,1,"I got these not for Kung Fu, but for minimalist running. I wanted something cheaper to transition from barefoot running, and to test the waters of minimalist footwear before investing in something more expensive. They were really good for this purpose, but are already starting to show some signs of wear. If you are looking for a traditional running shoe, offering support and cushioning, these offer none, because they aren't meant to, but I found them to be excellent for minimalist running.The shoes are made of a nice canvas upper with a sole made of very soft rubber.They're very lightweight and flexible, making them ideal and comfortable for minimalist running. The sole is very grippy, but you still get a lot of groundfeel. Since the sole is made of soft rubber you get a lot of grip, but they also pick up a lot of dirt. The downside is that they seem to wear out fairly quickly, especially if you are running on hot pavement.My only other complaint is an aesthetic one. While the upper itself is very nice canvas, the decal on the side is painted on, and doesn't show up very well on the black canvas, perhaps it would look nicer if they had another coat. It wouldn't be such an issue if the logo wasn't so prominent on the side.Eventually, I ended up trading up to the Merrell Barefoot shoe:Men's Merrell Barefoot Tough GloveWhich so far, I'm very satisfied with.Disclaimer: If you are new to barefoot and minimalist running, please do your research before jumping in. The motion and biomechanics of minimalist running is completely different from walking and running in traditional shoes. Aim for a naturally shock-absorbing forefoot strike, and avoid striking the heel, as this can lead to bone and joint damage. Above all, take the transition slowly and listen to your body."

277309,1,"I am very happy with this pilates reformer and it is a great value for the money. I have been taking pilates classes with the very expensive spring reformers.I decided to order this because I wanted to do pilates more often and am very pleased with the bungee cords; and in fact, prefer this workout to the springs. The one downside is that when I am laying down on the platform doing leg exercises, I cannot do them as well on this reformer because the cords will rub against my neck if I try to pull my legs straight down. However, I find that a minor inconvenience."

397046,0,There are pros and cons:Pros:1. Small and compact. Really feels solid.2. Its a good idea to put the button in the back side and you dont press the button but the edge of the comp which makes it water tight.3. Display is well designed with respect to the size of the devise4. The best you can probably get in the price range and with a cadence meterCons:1. Does not have back light. So practically useless in night condition unless you are interested to see average speed and all.2. Cadence update is kind of slow (although it is sufficient for beginners)3. The contact between the mounting and the comp is a bit sensitive as you need to clean it really well or else it stops sensing4. As it operates through only one button its a pain to shuffle between different information while riding.Overall I think its a very good product in its price range. What you pay vs what you get is really good.

89593,1,"This bench adjusts to 6 different positions. It's sturdy & great for crunches too. The wheels work fine on any type of smooth floor surface but not so much on carpet. Just lift it up in the front, & roll it back. Fits nicely in the corner of a room. Fairly easy to assemble. The split that separates the back from the seat could be improved upon though. It's uncomfortable in certain positions but not enough to warrant returning the item. This is a keeper!"

444213,0,"NOT water resistant at all.WATER LEAKS IN THE SHALLOWEST OF ENVIRONMENTS. Don't buy this watch if you have ANY intention of getting any wetter than you would at an office cocktail party.I've had the eco-drive watch for about one year or so, and during that time, it's been a pretty great watch. It runs well. Light is an issue if you spend a lot time in dimly-lit opium dens, and you must not live a nocturnal lifestyle like Eric Northman, or the watch will run slow -until your planet's yellow sun returns the watch to full power (which happens fairly rapidly).However, the part where citizen claims it's ""WR 50m"" is not true at all.I left my watch on with me today surfing (usually I take it off). I thought, ""you know 50 meters is pretty friggin deep, this baby must be air-tight."" Negatory.I don't think I was ever more than a few feet underwater (surfing in 4-10 foot deep water), and the inside of my watch is filled with water. It's still working for the time being. Additionally, while waiting for it to dry-out, you can also admire that it's not as bulky as it initially seems, you know, once you're used to wearing it and everything.But deep scarlet-letter variety shame on citizen for making its water resistant claim; it just ain't so. It's complete nonsense; they might as well claim it cures bone cancer or something; it'd be just as true as ""WR 50."" So not cool."

132544,0,"I bought the yellow and pink balls. I have twin toddlers, so I wanted something ""soft"" yet cute for them to play with when we go to the sand. The colors look great, the ball looks like its made of good construction, but I'm disappointed in the feel. I know its synthetic leather, but still, the NAME of the ball is ""soft play"". The ball came inflated and in a box (like you would buy from a retailer.) I may deflate it to see if that helps some.I also ownWilson AVP Official International Game Ball Volleyball. Its pricier, but if you can save up, the ball feels so nice to the touch. I'm an adult and play with this ball - it would be great for teenagers at least. I also just purchasedMikasa Starter One 5.5 Ounce Volleyballand I really like that for toddlers and little ones. It is a softer feel, light weight and has a nice rebound. I feel that touch is important when kids are learning to play. If their arms hurt, then they will likely not want to play as often.I wished I would have bought the Mikasa ball first. I'm disappointed in this ball and do not recommend it unless you are not that serious about volleyball, like the colors, or you need to stick to this price point.My background: indoor/outdoor player and usav club coach"
326166,0,"The material was a little thinner that I would have liked, and the decal has a tendency to attract lint and other fuzzy things. Overall build quality is good, with no torn seems or hanging threads."
280726,0,"Mine arrived flat not round. Im hopeing they shrink down properly and give a good seal, the price is good."
375211,1,"I ordered these to use on a cross-country domestic round- trip flight, and have since used them 3 times on local weekend driving trips. The large kit provides 3 or so 4oz bottles, which is great when you are sharing products, and for longer- term travel. You will have to check those bottles, as the TSA only allows for 3.5 oz for carry-on toiletries, and all your carry-on toiletries have to fit inside a little quart-size bag, anyway, so unless you split the fully-utilized kit between two carry-on travelers, it would not be possible for one person to carry- on all of the bottles in the medium and large kits, if all for liquids and creams, at least.I had no problems with leaks. I did use the flip-top spouted cap for the body lotion I took, and it did not leak in-flight, or otherwise. Some reviewers said that they had problems with those leaking. I just avoided storing liquids like mouthwash when using those caps, per their warnings, and everything was fine, and those caps actually come as extras, so you have the option to use them, at all.A little disclaimer: I did not fill the larger bottles to the top, so that may have affected their propensity for leaks. However, I filled a smaller bottle almost to the rim with mouthwash and there was still no problem.I like the material; nalgene is pretty tough, easy to clean, and somewhat translucent, so you can easily differentiate between products, Plus, the kit has different colored tops, although I do suggest marking products similar in appearance. A little humorous anecdote: I ""gelled"" my long hair with my face wash the first day, lol, because I forgot which one was which, since they are both clear and similar in consistency, and neither are very scented!Overall a good product, especially for the price. There is a good variety of sizes in my large kit, and it took care of both me and my boyfriend's needs, especially since we use the same main hair care products, and the heavier-weight plastic bag it comes in is great to use to store your checked toiletries when you are flying.I suggest these for anyone, since they have done well for us so far, and seem very durable, and it saves the hassle and expense of buying so many mini-toiletries. Plus, if you are selective about the products you use everyday, not only will you be able to take them with you in a reasonably- sized container for the duration of your travel and packing weight limits/space in baggage issues, but you do not have the risk of broken jars and bottles that can make a huge waste and mess, you are not required to you pack your whole bathroom, and you can store your leftover products in these seemingly airtight bottles until your next trip when you replenish them. Common sense will show you where this is not advisable for certain products, but, in general, I have just been keeping them in my carry-on toiletry bag, ready when needed. I even have a few in my big purse for when I clean up at the gym, and need to gargle after lunch.Happy pragmatic traveling!"
494538,2,"I ordered the LC -1 A.L.I.C.E. Pack Frame-Mil-Spec advertized as ""Used-Very Good"" for $19.99. It says it comes ""w/ OD Shoulder Straps / Kidney Pad & Belt with Grey Quick Release ARMY Buckle"". All I received was the frame. The frame seems pretty good, it's got a few dings and scratches and one of the strap slots is dented. All things you would expect from a ""Used"" frame, but no Straps or Kidney Pad...kind of something you need, to be able to carry the frame on your back."
417327,0,"My boy/girl twins each got one of these for their 2nd birthday. I thought they would really enjoy being pushed around and being able to pedal also but they are not interested in playing with them. They have the fisher price trikes at my parents house which are actually a little bigger than these and they seem to enjoy them much more. They hate when I try to push them and to be honest it is a little hard unless they will cooperate with steering because you have no control over turning corners when pushing with the handle! I think it would have been really nice to have had when they were younger so they could have used it as a rocker. I don't think I would recommend buying this for 1 1/2 and up, I would just go with the bigger fisher price trikes, diego or princess. Unless you are buying this for babies around 6 months you won't really get your money's worth!"
103704,1,"this chopper goes pretty fast, i custom spraypainted the front rims blak and they look tite, i also got the OCC sign and spraypainted it onto the tank, i forgot wat its called but i also spraypainted the gray box that holds all the ellectrical stuff, blak, it looks baddass, and it rides smooth"
81029,1,"I just put mine together and started using it. It's pretty easy to put together but you will need a real wrench and another person to help connect the resistance cable. Took my husband about 45 min and only a couple of choice words (while we were trying to hook up the resistance cable) to get it together. It is almost completely silent, the pedals turn smoothly, and the resistance is decent, although even the highest level isn't very strong. The resistance level wouldn't be a challenge for anyone that is fit and used to riding a bike, it is more for out of shape couch potatoes like me. The seat is sturdy and comfortable and the handles are too. The digital screen is basic but works fine and is easy to understand. There is a tiny bit of movement in the seat but it still seems safe and sturdy, the bolts may need to be tightened up after a few months of use. It supports our weight with no creaks or cracking noises (I weigh 240 and my husband weighs 275, hence the need for the bike). It is a solid, inexpensive, no frills bike. Great for beginning exercisers that need something affordable but not for someone in the market for gym quality equipment.EDIT: I've now had the bike for 4 months, we use it about an hour a week on the highest resistance setting. It still works perfectly, the seat wobbles very slightly but it's solidly bolted on, the screen works fine, the pedals are still silent."
120375,0,This lantern is smaller than I had expected but over all a good one that serves it's purpose. They only thing I wasn't happy about is the compass on the top is not working :(
292352,1,"We own 3 of them for the past 18 months (one per each family member). Overall, great value, and they paid for themselves already. We can leave them in the car overnight, and still drink the rest of the water the next day (in the unbearable Texan heat all plastic bottles last less than a day, then water turns yucky). We used them and abused them, but they held on pretty good, despite few scratches and dents. The carrying strap is very handy. Wish there would be one for 8oz bottle for our kid. The only problem is the wide bottle neck. It took us few months to learn how to drink without spilling the water all over our clothes. But... after we mastered that, the water tends to ""splash back to your face"" while the bottle is returning to the vertical position. Seems that now they offer drinking spout caps, but then we would have to go back to plastic. We would give a 5 stars to the SS bottle with SS cap with normal opening. Not everyone needs to drop icebergs into their bottles: some people actually enjoy room temperature water and it's considered healthier choice anyway."
247828,0,Nice product. However the S&H costs were high and it took forever to receive shipment.
21030,0,"The basket seems to be of a good quality considering the price. However, the picture appears white to my eyes; it isn't. I know the title says Natural Willow, but based on the picture I thought that was the material it was made of, not the color. Just so you know, it is both natural willow in material and COLOR!"
196335,1,This product works as advertised and is a handy item to have if you use bluk propane and two devices.
279933,0,"The gel pads themselves are wonderful but the straps are long and don't fit well around my 5 yr. old grandson's knees and elbows. Though they said it was for all sizes, yet they are not a perfect fit. Would recommend for an older child."
348115,0,nice for the money. she liked them... ... ... .. .. . .. . . . . . . .
502367,0,"I was pleasantly surprised. I took my lead from another reviewer and ordered two. Both were OK but one was clearly thicker and straighter than the other. The wood was still fresh enough to straighten (wax wood eh...) Also, the wood seems to have been collected correctly so there is no splitting at the branch nodes. All in all, I plan to order more.Even though the thickness is as advertised and the straightness is acceptable, I had hoped that one of the two I ordered might be the equal of a pole I bought a long time ago from Brendan Lai. No such luck, hence four stars. Maybe next time.FYI, 200 grit paper gives the poles a smooth sliding surface after a couple of dozen passes.-------------------------------------Time passes. It is now November 18, 2011.Since writing the review above I've ordered two more poles. I've downgraded the rating to three stars for two reasons. One of the poles has started to shed ""saw dust"" from a lot of little holes, meaning it's infested. Out of the four poles I've ordered, only two of the poles were thick enough to be useful to me. Sadly, the infested pole was one of the good ones.At this point I'm looking for a better source."
329551,0,the grey are kinda see thru. I have a feeling my junk is on display so wear underwear is a must. I like to be free under my gym shorts and the black ones are great.
24866,0,"I have been jumping rope for 2 years. I am not an expert, but in my humble opinion I like the speed ropes(the Master is best/the Aero is good too!) from Buddy Lee the best. This is not to say I disliked this rope, but I feel the Harbinger and Buddy Lee ropes performed a bit better. This rope felt a ""bit light"" at the handles. The handles are comfortable-I removed the sponge grips which I felt gave me a better feel of the rope."
103625,1,"This pump replaces my 10-year old pump. It has a very light-weight construction (a lot of plastic it seems), however is sturdy. There is a ball pump adapter that is included with the pump.The reason I gave the pump 4-stars instead of 5-stars is that the pump motion is much stiffer than I have ever experienced on a pump. This isn't a big issue if you're just pumping up a few tires, but I do think it would become an issue if I was pumping up 10's of wheels (I've got wimpy arms)."
490454,0,"This is a great concept; however, it does have some cons. As many of the other reviews state, the light comes on at both end. Seems they could have a switch that slides to which end you want the light to come on. Also, it was not well made. The key chain portion broke the first night that I used the key. Having said that, the key portion worked well with my Peerless and S&W cuffs."
458530,0,"The water poach is really not removable. I was looking for a day hydration pack that is also removable so that I could put it in my over night pack. Well the listing stated hat it is removable, but not really. You have to almost destroy it to get the hydration pack out, so it can not really be used for anything other than a day pack."
386256,0,SEAMS GOING TO HAVE TO DRILL OUT THIS SISSY BAR TO GETPROPER HIGHT FOR SEAT YES ITS 36 INCH BAR BUT THE MOUNTING HOLES ARE 19 INCHES AT BEST GOOD FOR A KIDBUT NOT GOOD FOR A COSTOM BIKE FOR A ADULT
456823,0,unfortunatley order was placed for a large recd medium too small will be returing item back on friday 03/03/06...thanks
198704,0,"This shape sorter needs a volume control and an off switch. The only reason that I gave it 3 stars is that my 10 month old son likes it, but it is very annoying for parents. He pushes the botton on top that lights up and says ""Shapes Colors Animals"" in a loud voice. He also likes the size of the blocks to chew on. However the animal images on the blocks are coming off as he scrapes his teeth on them. I thought that the shapes would fall inside the shell like an old fashioned shape sorter, but they only go half way into the shell. It is hard for me to get them into place, so I imagine that it will be hard for my son when he gets older, too. The turtle is cute and seems to be surviving getting beaten, drooled on and stepped on."
233734,0,"I bought a similar item for my friend. He liked it a lot. the only problem was that it a shade too small for him. but he is still using it al the same. For the price I got it for, I expected a good size but I cant complain. it is fair to buy."
28639,0,"Good quality, large capacity, and VERY HEAVY. It was so heavy in fact I returned it and bought two aluminum Pure Energy 48ci/3000psi tanks."
113258,1,"The Tiger Claw product I ordered quality was superb. The purple rank belt color was rich and stitching was done correctly.Also, the shipping was on time. I will order again through Amazon."
82530,1,Hard to find 25.8 posts for older bikes like this Fuji Monterey I was trying to fix up. This works great and I would recommend for replacement of old style posts which need a bracket on top to connect to seat. Excellent post if not looking for the high price fancy stuff.
207547,1,"Everyone should have a backup plan for what they will do should their water not be potable. This filter does 13,000 gallons of water, and is the perfect back up for camping or for having around the house incase of an emergency. I have used one of these for camping for many years. It is well made and does what it claims it will do. A great purchase for peace of mind!"
189912,0,"I bought this in lieu of the 3 ball version as this was prime shipping and the other was not. As mentioned in my other reviews, these balls seem to have lost their durability. They are wonderful fresh out of the can and for around 5 uses, after that the speed drops dramatically and is noticeable. Unfortunately, I havent found much better yet...."
370329,0,"Is okay. It is not a great box. It could be larger. The quality is mediocre. But it is not terrible. If you can find better, do so. It will do the job though."
155803,0,"warm, and very light. Easily packs to minimal size. However it is not very durable...wear it to the office it won't hold up to the woods."
401024,0,Got my Mesh torn. Since I live in Costa Rica it was a lot more expensive to send it back than to buy a new one here. Waste of money on this one!!!!
172357,0,"This product will put a lot of strain on your arms, back and abs. It's not just an abs workout. Since it's just a simple bar with 2 plastic (yet durable) wheels, you have to do all the work both on the way down and up. It has no spring action. It took me a while to get used to it but it works! You will feel the burn in your abs the next day after your first try. I have to use a pillow on my knees to do this exercise otherwise it will hurt. I use it both on wooden flooring and carpeted floors and works fine without damaging either flooring. Most of the time I feel like am getting a workout mostly in my arms but it's part of my abs routine."
412501,0,"This shirt is not true to size, way to big for my son. I thought he would be happy about it but he says it's way too big for him. They are very comfortable to wear and easy to care for. The material leaves much to be desired though...what a shame. I have purchased other UA for my son and hubby and they loved it. This one is not one of our favourites."
115168,1,"The Cateye Enduro 8 is a great basic cyclocomputer. With all of the basic functions like speed, trip odometry, total odometry, average speed, and time functions, it's good enough for the casual rider.And it makes an awesome gift for kids who love to ride bikes-- My younger relatives love it when they are able to see how fast and how far they are going on their bikes. A great way I think to get young people interested in the sport of cycling would be to put a cyclometer like this one on their bikes and let them rip!My first bike from 10 years ago I had a Cateye Enduro 8 on it. Every new bike I upgraded to since then I also put the Enduro 8 on it. It's been reliable and does everything i need it to do."
240979,0,"Inexpensive multi tool, I'm not disappointed but you do get what you pay for. I also wish it had stated in the online description that it was made in Taiwan and China. What's up with 'American' knife makers trading on their history and heritage and then importing their stuff from overseas. Sure, it might have cost another dollar to make it in the US - I would have paid the dollar."
78702,1,These are the some of the most comfortable grips available. I have then on the riser bars of my Bianchi track bike and recently put another pair of my single speed project that is soon to be a 3 speeder. These grips are spongy and soft in the hand and are also great at helping to reduce wrist killing vibration. Also a must if you have huge hands like myself.
215525,1,"I got the extra large. I am 5 ft 11 inches weigh 235 lbs, 40 inch waist, 56 inch chest, 30 inch inseam. This suit fit me perfect other than the leg length which is about an inch or two too long, but liveable. The knee patch is a little low for me but still ends up on my knee albeit a little lower.For the price and the fit I give it 5 stars!!The thickness is perfect for tropical dives in the 70s or deeper dives where it might get colder."
195702,0,broke the 3 time i ues it . ... .... .. ... .. . . . . . ... .
426703,1,"I purchased these gloves because I needed a very cheap pair to use for bag training. I am a martial artist, so I didn't intend to destroy the bag or anything, I just needed a fully padded glove that was comfortable.These gloves fit me very well (180lbs, male, 6ft) and provided sufficient padding for sustained blows. They are very comfortable, and are high quality considering the price. If you are looking for a cheap pair of bag gloves that are not completely oversized, check these out!"
504520,0,Works great...would be better if it was a little heaver as my griddle weight is significant. The product over all above average = good.
270012,0,"This looked perfect for my daypack emergency kit. I actually bought this for the little snuff box, (who's gonna pay $4 for wood shavings?), turns out it holds only 1 oz. and it's PLASTIC! Under GOOD conditions that amount might start 2-3 fires. Had it been metal, adding an O-ring would keep it's contents dry. I could've got the sticks & made much more for same price!"
486588,2,"UPSATE~~~~~~~~ We had slept on it for 3 nights and then stored it in it's box in the attic and got it out because my family was coming again and it has leaks and will not stay inflated, very comfortable bed but very disappointed in the quality and the fact we paid almost 100.00 to sleep on something less than a week.This is an outstanding bed and even more amazing guest bed. We got it over the holiday and it was going to be for my husband and I so mom could have our bed and heck I think I'd rather sleep on this one. Was real nervous about getting one of these type of beds since I have had 2 operations on my stomach in the last 6-8 weeks and was very unsure how I would sleep on one and let me tell you this was nothing like I would have thought! It was better. Best money spent!!"
359925,1,"This is a great value for the beginning boxer in your house. My only suggestion would be to upgrade the swivel that it comes packaged with. The one that's included is the most basic plastic swivel you can buy and after a few rounds of hitting the bag it would come unscrewed and end up getting punched across the room. I purchased the next step up in Everlast swivels for about $20 and the difference was instantly noticeable. Faster rebounds and a much more secure mount. You may also want to upgrade to a smaller bag after you get used to the one packaged with this kit. Oh, and one more thing, the kit comes with no lag bolts to mount it to a wall. I picked up 4 from the local hardware store for a few dollars, but I was surprised they weren't included like they were with the Everlast heavybag I also bought.For everything you get in this kit, it is well worth the money and a great way to get started in boxing for a good workout or competitive sport."
27848,0,just marginal is made out of a very ugly material and not much space for liquid - was over priced
280349,0,"I bought this jump rope because I wanted one that was long enough, I am 6'2 and thought this would be good. I like the quality of the jump rope but it was way too long for me. It said in the details that you could shorten it, but I haven't found a way to do that yet. I was a little disappointed."
317012,1,This glove feels good and looks good. My goal is to get all the colors. There are colors that you can't find ANYWHERE. If you don't play great you might as well look great.
335550,1,"These socks are great for winter. They have a wool feel, wash great without losing their shape or shrinking. They pull up to just under the knee. The toe is reinforced. I'd definately buy them again. They are not scratchy, but I wish they were a tiny bit softer. But if you like the wool feel, they are perfect."
25490,1,"Has all the options I need and works great. Haven't taken it out in the field yet, but took to a couple navigation classes and it has always worked as well or better than my classmate's compasses."
247335,0,"Russell Athletic Long Sleeve Tees I purchased a few years ago were made of heavy (I mean heavy) material. This shirt, while nicely made, is not nearly as heavy, the most important characteristic that I wanted in my tee. The addition of a tasteful logo on the sleeve cuff is meant to compensate for the reduction in cotton fiber?"
190137,0,"My 3 1/2 yr old rec'd these for the holidays. She does great with them on the carpet, but they are pretty slippery on the hard wood floors. Will try to use them outside once the snow melts. They are plastic, so not much to them, but fun starter skates."
241934,0,"These shorts are comfortable and fit well, but they are a little thinner than I would expect (as in see-through almost). Granted, they are inexpensive, but I guess I expect more from Russell Athletic clothes."
61083,2,"I purchased the screen tent to take it with us to Vancouver Island on vacation. The only good thing about it is the easy set up. The slanted sides allow the rain to pour in. The shape cuts into the space inside. You can only get a picnic table (placed directly in the middle) in it with walking room around the table. Also, at the bottom edge of the doors there is a flap that was always getting in the way. People were constantly tripping over it. The door zipper doesn't zip all the way down to the ground."
214127,0,Speedo is the hallmark of aquatic products. I trust the reinforce stitching. Gloves are true to sizes specified. The color matches my new Aqua Pro Ankle weights. :-)
461807,0,Overall I really like the cot with the pad for it's comfort. I do not like the design of the rubber bushings at the end of each leg because the end of the leg is angled to match the floor but the rubber bushings are not so if placed on a hard suface the bushing splits. I had three out of six split and called Amazon who handled the complaint quickly. Although I wanted just new bushings they sent a new bed and I returned the original one. I slept on the new bed for one night and one of the bushings split which was predictable since this is a design problem and not a quality issue. If this bed is used in a tent there is a possibilty the legs would tear the tent bottom. The warranty that comes with the bed gives no place to contact at Teton. I will buy pads to put under each foot when I use the bed and use it but the design needs changed.
78171,0,The funnel workes great. I did have to cut the top band about an inch and a half lower. It was so stiff that it would not work it's way down to the bottom of the 55 gallon drum. After the trim to the top band it went down very easily. everything is installed and my feeder is working great.
70141,0,"This was ok... one of those moments that you get what you pay for... it wasn't bad, but it really wasn't good"
45532,0,The size is accurate. I'm more used to the neck hole being wider than this and also the hand openings are a little tight. Other than that it fits fine.
286285,0,For the money this is a good set of replacement grips for the Dan Wesson 357mag model 15. However its gonna take a little modification and some patience to get the original screw to work. Had to use a drill bit to make the set hole in the grip a little deeper. A good set of grips though once you get it to work
219783,1,"Every once in a while you get an unbelievable value. This simple,stylish shoe for under $20.00 is a great minimalist running shoe. Reminds me of the old Converse canvas shoe but actually much lighter. great sticky rubber sole. All in all a great value. I have bought 3 pairs for under $60.00. These sell for much more on other auction pages. I use them for trail running in Colorado but they look great with jeans."
176826,0,You show a picture of the 29.5 inch mens ball but the titling of the ball reads women's basketball? What type of ball is this??
318289,0,The pant's were nice but for me they did not fit the size was a little off but the product was good.
480035,2,"Sure its your average shirt, maybe I got unlucky. I washed mine once and the thread started to unravel on the bottom seam."
407968,1,"Park is a solid tool for wrenching your bikes. This is a good tool and nicely made due to laser cutting opposed to some of the cast versions of past and some other import brands. BUT, some of those old Park versions held tighter tolerances. This new one is somewhat within spec and slightly oversized at .25mm. As an FYI, if you have headsets that are undersized these difference can translate into the wrenches leaving marks on the aluminum parts.Good tools that will last a lifetime."
398869,1,"This lube goes on and cleans up easily, and since applying it my bike ride has been much smoother and quieter (the chain doesn't make a sound when switching gears). I haven't used it in wet weather, so I can't comment about that, but I think this makes a good general chain lube."
151498,0,"This purchase was the first major screw up that has happened to me while using Amazon.com.I ordered heat shrink tubing but I received an inflatable boat fender instead.I know it sounds crazy but it is true.The UPS man had to use a dolly to bring it to my door. All the time I am looking at this giant box I am saying, ""What in the world could this be?""It was so crazy and funny that there was no way that I was going to send it back.Since I do not have a boat or a friend with a boat I have no practical use for the item except as a conversation piece.So a week or two after my experience I see someone making the news where they received an assault rifle after ordering a computer monitor.Anyway... It was worth a laugh or twelve."
419842,1,"I use it for something that wouldn't have to much strength, but I took a few meters to use it on my jeep to pull some cars or pick ups when needed, It works just great!!!"
248576,0,"I knew the price was low but, I was expecting the set to be more substantial. Especially because of the Coleman brand. It is ity bity small and flimsy but, it does work. Just don't get your hopes up that you can prepare an entire meal in these."
105832,0,It is a great bike cover. Easy to cover. Easy to store. Great color and material. Wish it was bigger.
309023,1,"is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do, other brands or kinds are just not good enough, high quality and low price is all i need"
389050,0,"Shirts are very soft and thick, but after the first washing they shrank so much that they went from a small men's shirt that looked large to a small woman's sized shirt! I wear small men's and these came out too small."
441510,1,"I really like Keen, and these shoes are very comfortable. I was pleased to find this at Amazon. The shoes came in quickly and fits my feet exactly. I will order again from Amazon."
100433,1,"Columia brand is true to it's claims! Great to keep near the door for those cool fall days when you want to be warm and look great and in style!I had already purchased one of these jackets, but could find no other colors in my size.Where did I go?

90369,1,"Took this Frisbee golfing, and it was it effortless to get par 2s and 3s on every hole. Then my idiot friend wanted to use it for one hole. He took it and threw it as hard as he could at like a 45 degree angle. Flew super high until it was not much more than a little dot in the sky, and darted straight for a cluster of trees. We looked for a half hour and couldn't find it.This thing is amazing, just keep it away from idiots.:)"
14354,0,This product is extremely difficult to figure out. I can't understand the directions. It has many features but no one I know can figure how to use them. I am looking for someone who has this watch who can help me. It seems to be reliable and keeps time. . . but the rest I have yet to figure out.

All were good fit and shipped as expected.These did not say tagless, but they were. A bonus. I bought white and gray. Both excellent."

312090,0,"I just got these in the mail today, and I am unsure as to whether or not these shoes are legit. Although they came in a box, the shoes did not come with the ""Converse Chuck Taylor"" tags that usually come with the product. There are also some minor cosmetic issues (the stitching near the toe area of the shoes are uneven). Also, the label inside the tongue says that these shoes were made in Indonesia. The Converse that I used to wear were either made in China or Vietnam."
190329,0,"I needed more running/work out shorts, and I couldn't find anything to really beat this price. I love soffes, specifically because they ""move with your body"". They're normally not too baggy, falling down, or not fitting in those ""awkward"" areas.Either I've gotten to be a smaller size, or these shorts are knock-offs...because these shorts don't fit me like my other soffes. They're awkwardly baggy in the crotch, the bum isn't defined, the legnth is a bit longer than the others (even when ""properly"" rolled up).The main pro is that the material is very soft and comfortable. So I could see myself wearing these to the gym, and maybe even to bed on a warmer night.So bittersweet? I guess."

330180,0,"I was looking to get some pushup bars for using with P90X. Someone talked me into get these ones. It seems to be that the Perfect Pushup bars are geared toward the workout that comes with the bars themselves. While I have been using them with P90X, I wish I would have bought bars that do not rotate."
190645,2,I was extremely disappointed with the goggles. I wanted a second pair that provided UV protection. They do. BUT... 1) They are uncomfortable. 2) Adjusting them is NOT friendly 3) They fogged on my second use (BIG no-no) 3) It comes with nose bridges of different sizes but it is IMPOSSIBLE to change them 4) They either suck your eyeballs out or let water in if you try to adjust... no happy medium :(Will return product this week. This review is specifically for the Vanquisher product. I have other speedo goggles that work perfectly fine. This one is just not the right one for me.

189214,0,Boots looked like they would work well and were made well. They do not work with the EP-950 however. I noticed small print in manual after I had purchased them that declared that. I tried everything I could think of to get them to work but to no avail. According to the manual the conversion bar won't work either. I did find that karate foot pads work great to ease the pressure on the feet. Glad I kept them around over the last 20 years.

260495,0,"This fuel line connector fits Honda Outboards but instead of a true spring, it has a metal channel that sort of acts like a spring to keep the connector attached to the outboard fuel inlet. The channel works but sometimes has to be adjusted to ensure the connector stays attached to the outboard. So, there are tradeoffs for buying ths inexpensive connector. Then again, my original Honda hose line connector had a fail proof spring attachment mechanism but the connector face that fits adjacent to the outboard fuel inlet developed a micro-crack on the sealing surface (after 2+ years of frequent connecting and unconnecting) and that is why I originally had to replace the OEM connector. I probably would go back to the OEM style connector (w/spring) if the 2 connectors I recently purchased turn out to be bothersome with adjusting the channel frequently."
73619,1,"I purchased the red and the blue. They are both very comfortable and warm, but the blue one has a different type of neckband. It is narrower and too loose. I don't understand why there is a difference. I would still recommend them. I like the 50/50 blend because it is lighter in weight, but still very warm. It is also softer."
354215,1,"I just wear these as normal shoes and for slow jogging. It takes awhile to get used to their no-support, but it works very well for my feet. I found myself feeling strangely energized when I started jogging with them -- maybe their lightness is the difference, I don't know. I can jog further and more easily. They are very comfortable. I also have them tied so that they make nice slip-ons when you want to get going in a hurry. I had a series of sports/jogging shoes in a row that just didn't feel optimum to me, and these are finally the ones that work great. Whenever these wear out I'm sure I'll get another pair."

219617,1,We got these shoes for our Kids tournament. They loved it. It's packed very nicely and was delivered on time.Shoe sizing was perfect and they are very comfortable shoes. Our kids use it for their martial arts classes and tournaments. They love these shoes as they have been using them for past 4 years. These shoes are very easy to maintain and last very long. After usage I wash it in washer and then use dryer. They come out like new. Ofcourse these shoes are strictly for martial arts and not for walking on streets.

223305,1,"I'm overweight but working hard to lose the extra bulge and was hesitant to try Yoga but wanted to give it a shot. I rented this video and was overall very pleased with it (I'm familiar with Cathe's other low-impact videos and she is one of my favs). I recommend watching the video first and trying the poses so you know what to expect before you do the whole routine.I simply could not do some of the poses because my excess fat got in the way, but was able to do some minor modifications so that I could still get some benefit. The only exception was the balancing poses - I had to lay my foot on a chair behind me as I could not reach behind and grab onto my foot from the inside (or outside) as directed. Others like me may have the same problem but I still felt resting my foot on the chair and stretching forward will give you some benefit and help you work TOWARDS being able to do the real pose. I was very pleased, however, that I COULD do MOST of the poses without modification or excess strain. So if you are overweight and getting back into shape like me, don't hesitate to try this video, just be aware that you may have to make some modifications and DON'T do any poses where you feel uncomfortable or stressed as that means you are doing the pose wrong or over-extending yourself. I don't know if I'll buy this video - I think instead I would take a real Yoga class with an instructor who has worked with overweight people and can help us safely acheive the poses.Those of you who are already in shape will probably LOVE this video and get a lot of benefit from it. I found it an excellent way to finish my workout week, stretch out all my tired muscles, and let the stress melt away."
210826,0,"this shuffler is really made for a man's use, as you have to hold the cards down on each side, thus you need a large hand to span over the handle, as you need the other hand to turn the handle.i guess that is as best as it can get. My friend holds one side whilst I hold the other,then it works most of the time. sometimes the cards still get caught up in it."
347873,0,"Received unopen package in timely manner. Installed in Rollerblade/ skates. Checked sound and was a little disturbed. Some make weird noises. Lucky I bought cleaning kit and had disassembly instructions for bearings. Took apart every bearing and cleaned with rubbing alcohol and dried well with air compressor, then used speed lube from bones, only 2 drops in each bearing. At first I though the bearing were used if they were making a noise. I decided to clean and look at white paper towel to see if there was grit or sediments. I found sediments in only a few (3 or 4) due to manufacturing which I think might be normal. After cleaning and checking roll and noise the was only about 4 that I was not happy with, lucky I bought more then I need and now understand why they come in packs of 20 because I only needed 16 to work. 2 didn't roll very well and 4 total that had noise issues. Ceramics do make noise and work fine. Guess if you want perfection you have to buy more then you need like I did and test for the best. Expensive way to have the very best so if money is hard for you to come buy maybe something more definitive would be better like bones non ceramic. I think it is hard for the manufacturer to have them all work perfectly and I don't think the seller was trying to short me in any way. It did take a long time (1-2 hours)to clean them though and you can easily damage the seals if you don't use the right tool or have hands like a surgeon. I repair laptops for a living so it wasn't that hard to develop a safe way to remove them with a very small flat head screw driver and a straight paper clip to go through the middle knocking out the other side. I ended up getting new k2 skates for $300 from Sports Chalet that come with abec 9 on 90 mm wheels that roll just as good most likely (Not tested) so my girl friend who is rolling with beach rusted abec 5 will get these most likely. Hope that helps"

289220,0,"I use them when I study because it's really noisy where I live. They do work at making small sounds still go away, but you definitely still hear people talking clearly and music (or maybe I just live with really loud people). I wouldn't recommend using them for a long period of time because they create a lot of inner-ear pressure and I get really bad headaches after wearing them. But when I'm desperate and can't get away to a quite place, they definitely work better than regular earplugs."
228419,0,"I have had several pairs of these over the years, but this pair is really strange. Same size on the tag as my last pair, but not the same dimensions.

77530,2,"I was initially excited to purchase this stepper. The shipment was fast, payment was easy, but it was a nightmare after that. First, the parts didn't match up like it did in the manual. Not only that, but I put in batteries for the computer part of the stepper and the batteries burned within seconds!! The actual stepper part could not be adjusted and didn't even move up and down! It was honostely, the WORST online purchase I have ever made. Now I have to deal with the Brookstone catalog people and figure out a way to return it. I would have brought it to the nearest store, but they said they couldn't do anything about it. Do NOT buy this machine! :("

Very unhappy!.When I got back to the truck I found the gps still worked if I put regular battery's in it, so it ruined my brand new rechargeable batts.Be warned (check it out before you go!)"
10306,0,"This vest was so thin that by holding it up to the light you could see through it. A large size which I usually wear was way to big--should have gotten a medium.

316627,2,"Normally, you'd expect a company to understand a man and his underwear. Sadly, UA does not.When I received this underwear, I was able to wear it once. Once. Why? Because it simply fell the hell apart half way through my day as I was wearing it.Chances are, this is just a defective case. Yeah, probably. So what do I do? I go and contact UA support. First of all, I had to continuously try to get them to actually talk to me. I'd say I had a problem with their underwear breaking down on me. What do they say? To use the return form and send it back, followed by an immediate disconnection! I had to try continuously contacting them to get them to say anything else what so ever. When I finally do, I ask whether or not I could just provide proof of purchase (a receipt + picture). They simply deny me.I mean, really. Sending back a gross, dirty pair of underwear that you sweated in all day to the point they break isn't something you want to do. After denying me, they refused to talk to me whatsoever. They simply disconnect as soon as I enter the chat, refusing to talk to me at all! Furthermore, their employees constantly gave attitude and belittled me at the same time.UA, you're a damn shame. A damn shame."

383467,1,"I used this thing extensively with my Contour HD, it took a serious beating on a boat and it never budged. I swear by it. If you're going to buy a universal mount yet you don't care about the Contour's audio, then I suggest a change of mind.. buy the waterproof case instead of the Universal mount. Why? Because the waterproof case comes with a universal mount under it. Two birds. One stone."
120445,2,"I have never written a review before, but the quality (or lack thereof) of this product warrents it. I purchased 6 of these stopwatches based on the reviews, the size of the display and the size of the buttons for a swim team. Most of the watches were malfunctioning from the beginning and by the second use were useless. Do not waste your money. No reliable starts, no reliable finishes. Spend your money on a better quality watch."
92812,1,This cassette was purchased to replace my Sun Race 8-speed cassette. It works well with the new KMC chain and I found the shifting smooth. The most important feature was that there was no noise from the chain shifting operation unlike Sun Race product. The 11-32 selection was for exact replacement and I found it very comforting to experience sure-shifts with this product. I recommend it for any hybrid bikes like my CANNONDALE QUICK -5.

Still, they aren't as tight or as well-constructed as my Franklin compression shorts, nor are they as form fitting as my wife's compression shorts that were purchased from Wal-Mart.

Just be careful when adjusting the links . . . there's a sleeve for the link pins that has to be put back in to get the pins to stay in. All of the dials are easy to read. I like the size and weight of the watch too. The Eco Drive is a great feature, no winding and no special case needed as with the automatics . . . just expose the watch to light and it keeps going. The meter to show how much reserve power is in the batter is good for letting you know when it's time to give the watch some sun."

74864,2,"As a bicycle enthusiast who has owned CatEye products for nearly 20 years, I eagerly attached this light to by mountain bike and went for a spin around the streets and trails of Manhattan. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with its overall usability.The light uses three intense bluish-white LEDs that are very easy to see from a distance when facing the light. However, these are not powerful enough to illuminate a trail, road, or pothole. In short, the light is excellent tool to acknowledge your position to oncoming motorists and other cyclists. The flashing mode is especially easy to see. Yet, the light is simply not powerful enough to illuminate the ground before you. Hence, it is basically useless if you are trying to avoid potholes on roads or vehicle barriers on poorly lit bicycle trails.ProsGood ConstructionMultifunctionWaterproofConsInsufficient brightnessUses AAA instead of AA"

I bought this in anticipation of my trip to Hawaii and was very disappointed when I received it. It is also extremely thin and thus, not very suitable for the beach. The slightest gust of wind blew the towel up and we ended up having to weigh the corners down with our sandals. I recommend looking elsewhere for an actual beach towel.

477492,0,"Assembling was not as bad as I thought it would be. My goal for this gym was to tone up my muscle and it work well. Although I think the gym can't compare to the real weight. The initial tension of the rod is weak while it tense up at the end. e.g. When you lift 50 lb dumbell, you would have a 50 lb dead weight. For the Blowflex, as you lift you will feel 30lb, 40lb, then 50lb. Overall I gave it a 3 star."

479750,0,"Under product features it states ""100% Cotton"" they are actually 58% polyester/42% cotton (at least the 2 I received which were Large colors-Graphite and Oxford). They will breathe, only because they are VERY lightweight. Very thin cotton that I do not expect to last more than a few washings. I would have been better off getting basic Hanes color T's at Walmart for $3.99 each.UPDATE 12/4/2009 - 3 years old now and they have held up fine. After researching the Russell Athletic website the gray tones are a poly mixture, the other colors are 100% cotton. If you are looking for the old-school heavy duty quality search for ""Russell Athletic PERFORMANCE"", these are the T's I grew up with and last for decades, but I'm overall happy with the basic line."

498009,0,"I usually prefer the compression shorts type boxer brief, but they can be rather suffocating for my nether bits- so I decided to try something a bit more breathable. I have two pairs of the regular Exoficcio boxers and I love them, but I do like a tight fit when wearing jeans so I picked up a pair of these to try out. They ride up a lot, I'm constantly adjusting them all day long when I wear them. It gets old, real fast. I don't think they would have this problem if they were a bit longer on the thighs and slightly tighter. As they are now, they are too short to keep a good hold on your thighs so they tent to ride up during daily movement. I'm not unhappy with the purchase, and I do still wear them on occasion, but I think they could have been designed better."

446136,0,"Purchased this set of keys for 1988 and 1990 Yamaha Waverunners, the lanyard material and quality is good. Plastic of the keys is as good as OEM, the problem is this keys are a bit too thick. The YAMAHA key was unusable due to the thickness but fortunately there was another key on there that worked. The problem is they don't yank of the kill switch easily, you have to pull REALLY hard. We did fall off each one of the waverunners and both times the key remain attached on both ends flipping the PWC over. I had to yank it off by tugging at it pretty hard. All in all its better than illegaly riding with a zip tie attached and watching your jet ski drive away while you swim for it against the current LOL"

426587,1,"I like this watch because it's easy to read as your running or walking along. Thus far, the band seems to withstand sweat and water pretty well. I have only owned it for a week. It feels rather lightweight on my wrist, which is what I think a sports watch should be.Also the picture up above makes the watch appear purple and white but the lighter color is actually all silver. I think the color goes well with the watch.Overall a nice watch for a good price. I could see spending twice as much for a Columbia watch that does the same thing, and doesn't look half as nice. You can't go wrong!"
452961,2,"Did not buy from Amazon, but the product is the same. The pair of dumbbells handles I received had immediate chrome flaking. I took a napkin to wipe of to what seemed to be just dust, but in fact it was the unfinished chrome. Or maybe it is finished and it was just finished in a unsatisfactory manner. This chipped off chrome degrades the products useful life and provides to be an airborne health hazard. I highly suggest not to buy this product and search for another option."

I was disappointed.Chips contain little to no clay at all.If you're a hardcore poker fanatic like me and require quality casino-like chips, this set is NOT for you.I ordered these a long time ago and did not do enough research.However, this chip set is great for the casual player.Case is nice and sturdy. Should last a very long time.Also I don't know why the list price is $130. I see this set being sold everywhere for the same $40 price tag."
267901,0,"The goggles come with a very good price but I found that they are not comfortable to wear. I later purchased the one made by TYR, and it's much better for me to wear when in the water with my kids. I'm not a competitive swimmer though."
170894,1,Love this thing. Best of both worlds.... spinning and stationary. I got it installed in my bedroom and my fiance cant complain. :)
270795,0,I like these as they seem to run a bit small and my foot is about a 7 or 7.5 length. Minimal cushioning and best for warm weather.
246792,1,"Shirts arrived very quickly and fit nicely. I had bought exact same item at Sam's Club but the shirts from Amazon are not 100% cotton like the same items from Sam's Club. The actual content is 53% Polyester and 47% cotton. I held one star back for misleading advertising (see Amazon photos showing wrong label). However I like the shirts and although they are thinner, they might be better in terms of wear and they look better (hang smoother on you). So anyone allergic to polyester might be screwed. I'd recommend these shirts for comfort over the cotton for me."
147747,0,"The item description is unfortunately non specific when it comes to the teeth on the sprocket. A detail which is fairly important in the functionality of a chain drive bicycle. The sprocket that I received is a 19 tooth, which is quite large when paired with a 16 inch rim also required a new chain to compensate for the extra teeth. It works, but it is not ideal for the Schwinn Pixi that I was restoring for my daughter.They also advertised that the coaster brake components were Shimano, but what I received was some no name brand. Still works, but not really what I was told I was purchasing.Would have been nice to have some extra thrown in to compensate for the component change such as a rim strip, but there was not even an explanation on the packing slip.The packing was fine and the shipping though UPS was quick so that was nice. All in all I am satisfied."

353622,0,"Part of the frustration of playing a game like this on the Wii is that you have to completely change the way you think about game controls, and there are many new controls to learn. Thus, this game is actually more enjoyable in Family Play mode. You can jump right in and get the basic moves down before attempting to use full control mode.Some basic moves: rather than shoot the ball by pressing a button, you shoot by making a shooting motion with your hand. Rather than pressing the left or right arrows to steal, rebound, and block, you're flicking your wrists left or right. The B button is to pressure defense or to drive the ball down the lane. The A button or the arrow pad is used to pass.The graphics are nowhere near NBA 2K8, but they aren't bad either. Players faces look like the players, and there's a nice variety of dunks and finger rolls to give the game some authenticity.The most difficult thing to do is shoot free throws. You have to do the shooting motion at the right speed/power level to make the shot. The better the free throw shooter, the greater the area on the meter for a successful shot.Overall, a decent game that's a part of my rotation during basketball season."
382093,0,"This chair is well-constructed. It folds up easy and is light-weight to carry. It is also a fairly comfortable chair to sit in, and the drink holder is very convenient. On the down side, however, is that the chair does NOT fully recline. This chair is appropriate for a camping trip but not the best for the beach, which is what I had purchased it for. Overall, think about exactly what you want to utilize this chair for before purchasing."

183416,0,"This helmet gets the job done. The inside seems a little weird and it was hard to get used to as it seemed a little tight. It was not adjustable like the other helmets. If you have a big size head please do not buy this helmet. I have a pretty small/medium size head and it feels tight at times and it was not really what i was looking for, however, I only go for bike rides every so often so it gets the job done for the price."
296068,0,"Not my favorite or my least liked one. This ended up being my spared glasses to wear while I am doing procedures to avoid fluids spurting into my eyes.Not a great quality, but worth the price. Glass clarity is good. there is some fogging, though."

95765,0,"This is a great fridge for use in a truck or SUV. Large size for a long road trip with a lot of people.

388481,0,"I was fortunate to get the unit undamaged (unlike many other reviewers). However, there are two significant issues with this safe.First, it should NOT be advertised as ""anti-theft"". It can not be bolted to a floor like most other brands, meaning that the thief simply has to pick it up and walk away with it. Yes, it's heavy, but the UPS man lifted it out of his truck, I carried it in the house, etc.Secondly, the combination instructions are (as many users have pointed out) quite confusing, and different in the book and on the sticker. I did get it after a couple of tries, but now use only the key to open it.One other observation. I had stored some papers in the safe without opening it for a number of months. When I opened the safe, the documents were actually damp and starting to mildew. I don't see how any humidity in the air when I closed it could have done that. Perhaps the ""water proof"" aspects of this safe cause an issue with trapping any moisture that happens to be present. Anyway, I collected some silica gel packets and placed them in the safe... hopefully that will prevent a repeat problem."
304393,1,"I use these at Pro Football games I go to. They are nice because you can see more of the field. There is no focusing to deal with, if you dont have 20/20 vision you just have to have your contacts or glasses on. Overall I like them."
444821,1,This Sweat Shirt is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a Medium Weight Hoody. I am very pleased with this purchase and vendor. I would certainly buy from Champs through Amazon again. The turn around on the order was faster than expected and the shipping was fantastic.
309681,0,"Victorinox Swiss Army Huntsman with Free PouchThe pouch is definitely too small for the knife it is sold with. I bought a few of them and none of the knives would fit into the pouch.

19769,1,"My wife and I (and our dog) have used the tent a couple times now and love it! We were looking for a larger, and taller inside tent then our 7' x 9' Coleman dome. The Columbia Bugaboo is easy to set up, but of course we set it at home one evening before taking it out on a trip. Should do that with any tent. Although we are slightly disappointed at the dimensions not being as large as the 12' x 9' that they market this at, it is still a lot bigger than our old dome and a really cool inside ""floorplan"". Great height (76"")! I doubt this thing will sleep 5 like they claim. You could probably sleep 4 and have room for your bags though.Stays dry in rain! Stays warm on cold nights (you will need to use the rain fly to stay warm because the whole back half of the tent is screen, which I like!) and cool when it's hot, due to the Cyclone Venting System (vents at the bottom of the sides that you can zip open and closed).Columbia really markets this thing well with all the little features and gadgets like quick-release buckle system on the rain fly, two hanging cup holders, removable door mat, Cyclone Venting System, remote-controlled outside light, triangle area dividers, two storage foot locker small door thingies, cool carry bag with handle, the overhead cargo net, and so on, but once you get the tent set up and are using it, you will see that NOT ALL those features are that great.I do really like the cup holders, the venting system, the light (for when I am coming back from the restroom and flash it couple times to see where the tent is), and the quick-release buckle system on the rain fly, and the little door thingies on either side of the main door are cool, but like some reviews stated, the zippers get stuck on the fabric really bad on those little doggie/cargo/foot locker doors so we didn't use these as much as I thought we would (these doors are part of the reason I bought this particular tent). None of the other zippers are a problem like reviews said they were?!?!? We also don't use the ridiculous triangle area dividers, not sure what the purpose is of those. We like the idea of the overhead cargo net, but it is in the way for a 6 foot tall person like me, se we don't use that either. We would use the supplied door mat, but it takes more time at set up and we prefer to use our own door mat.I have seen people complain on these reviews about not having a ""footprint"" or tarp for underneath not coming with the tent, but I rarely see those provided with tents in this price point so relax people and go to Lowes/Home Depot or Walmart/Target and buy an $8 12' x 9' tarp!Overall, this tent is awesome! We love it! Seems to be very quality and that is the most important thing to me. Features are cool, but didn't use all of them. And for the $119.00 price that I got it at, you can't lose!Buy it!"

203121,0,Buy the stove with the push-button ignitor. The self ignitor mechanism on this stove is a tab on the back of the knob. The plastic is not terribly strong and breaks off fairly easily. I have had this happen to two of my stoves so far. It is well worth pushing an ignitor button in order to have a more reliable stove.
173185,1,"This trailer is very good on price but the material could be better. Even with being careful not to rip the fragile nylon material, the areas around the snap fastener will seperate first then anywhere stress is put on it (i.e. straps). After about the 3rd time using it, I didn't grab the snap close enough, and pulled the nylon, and started to rip it until I caught myself. Did this on a couple different areas. Overall, it is very stable, very easy to connect to the hub, and you can ride at 15 mph on a smooth service with no worry about it tipping over. The hardest part about the setup is putting the hub on the rear wheel of your bike. Very easy to fold back up and hang up on a hanger in your garage."
372033,0,"The Amazon product description might lead you to believe that this product is 90% cotton. However, if you read everything all the way through, you will find that certain colors are a different product made from, for example, 65% cotton 35% polyester. So, be careful. The one I got in charcoal heather will serve its purpose ok, but I would have preferred as close to all-cotton as possible."
128802,1,"I'm very satisfied with the quality of the leash, collar and pendant as well as the shipping speed. I just wish there was an option to engrave the pendant before getting it. Now I have to go out somewhere and pay more money for someone to do it for me."

130050,1,"I bought this flashlight 5 years ago. The main factors in my purchase were the Beam quality of this unit, the size, battery type and ability to shift between Xenon & 2 modes of LED bulbs.The Xenon beam is full, and consistent throughout. I found this a pleasure, as my old MAG light had a huge dark spot.I can conserve battery power and switch to Low LED or High LED modes, instead of using the Xenon bulb.the C-Cell batteries are easier to come by than the D-Cell batteries. Since it's a 3-cell flashlight, the beam is brighter and lasts a long time.The housing seems almost indestructible. I've dropped mine in the water, on rocks and have used it to tap in nails when camping.Overall, a great product, and can stand the test. 5 years and this flashlight is still running strong. I tend to camp at least 6 times per year."
35570,1,The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent.

274441,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."

114562,0,"These are cut a little big, and that's pretty typical for a rain jacket. It feels rubberized to the touch, and does keep you very dry. There are air vents under the armpits small enough that they should't let water in-- great feature. There are also two huge pockets on the front to keep items you need to keep dry.The only thing I don't like about this jacket is that it makes a lot of plastic noise. If you're out in the rain, this doesn't matter, but any time it's not raining you're going to be ""loud"".If I am going to be wearing a jacket for rain purposes I would personally prefer the Columbia Omni-tech or Titanium Tech jacket. Far more stylish, quieter, and better ventilation, at more cost."

405902,1,"My wife got me this knife for my birthday because I mainly use small and mid-sized knives and have so far avoided getting a taste for the huge Bowies. She wanted to see if I liked this type without spending much. The answer is yes, I like it a lot.It's massive and nose-heavy, with the point of balance right at the big full-finger choil in front of the guard. This weight-forward configuration makes the knife very eager to chop, and I immediately complied by destroying some lemons, potatoes, corn cobs, and an old pine 2x6. The edge was shaving-sharp right out of the box, but my abuse resulted in some bright spots where the edge was visibly dinged. I restored it in under a minute with an Accusharp carbide-V sharpening gadget.The primary bevel is a half-flat or ""saber"" grind, which emphasizes strength over slicing. Still, the knife excelled at the above-named kitchen tasks, as well as slicing celery, bell peppers, and meat. It was not quite optimal, however, for dicing onions. The thick, heavy blade tended to bind in such firm material and was a bit fatiguing to use. Still, it got the job done, and I found the radically clipped point very nimble and handy for piercing. I only wished I had a coconut to split.I have my doubts about the edge-holding ability of this knife, as it is made from obviously inexpensive 420-J2 stainless steel subjected to who-knows-what heat treatment, and I have managed to ding it up a bit initially. But it certainly isn't brittle, which would spell uselessness for a knife like this. I imagine that a few sessions with the Accusharp might re-profile the edge to a more durable angle, but only time will tell.The package says it is made for the Winchester brand by ""Carolina Knife and Tool,"" which I hear is a cheaper label of Gerber knives-- the Ford to Gerber's Lincoln, if you will. So I would imagine that they have some idea of how to make a good knife, even if they are doing it in China.The handle scales are Pakkawood, an engineered wood laminate that behaves much like hardwood but is inert, which is to say that it will not move or shrink or crack. It's stained to look like rosewood and finished with a tough, glossy lacquer or polyurethane. Together with the brass guard and pins, it makes for a more attractive package than other inexpensive ""survival"" or ""tactical"" knives. My only complaint is the finger ridges, a bit of over-engineering that can only detract from the knife's versatility.The sheath is heavy, stiff Cordura nylon with plastic reinforcement at the throat and two retaining straps with snaps. It's not too fancy, just a secure, durable, weatherproof sheath that rides nicely on the belt. It does have a few nasty bits of Hide of the Nauga around the snaps, which is no big deal.I wouldn't hesitate to carry this knife in the woods, as long as I could also carry a sharpening gadget like the Accusharp or the Meyerco Sharpen-It to allay my reservations about the blade material. If you had to choose one do-everything backwoods knife, this really would not be a bad choice, as it is capable of heavy chopping as well as more delicate tasks like slicing vegetables. To step up at all in the Bowie market would require triple the price at the very least, and so I'd say this is a great knife for seeing if you're interested, and it'll get some work done while you're at it. It has certainly whetted my appetite for more of these big knives."

When I bought this helmet on Black Friday-I saw the photo, knew it was what I was looking for and made sure that I purchased the right size and hit the buy button.What I got was a Matte GRAY helmet without the cool stickers.....the DESCRIPTION says it's matte gray, so I felt duped by the photo and left my review since I didn't want to deal with returning and reordering a new one and having to go to the post-office and wait in line.When Angela called me today she explained that Amazon places the photos on the site and agreed that it was incorrect. She apologized that this happened and told me they wanted to make me happy! They don't even have this helmet in white, but she said that she would get the sticker pack and put it in the mail to me today. I agreed to update my review because I didn't know Amazon placed the photo and that she should not have a bad review for something out of their control & the fact that I didn't read!Great product, I'm keeping it to give my 13yr old son-he will be thrilled with the sticker upgrade!I will buy from Zephyr Sports again just based on their personal service."

136934,0,"I'm not trying to be all buyer beware, but I would recommend doing thorough research before selecting which rear rack you'd prefer. There's multiple brands offering their own benefits and I chose the Topeak RX Beamrack E-Type namely because I thought the price was a steal. Its often sad when one is motivated by the price but I'm a student so what can I do! Anyways, check Topeak's actual website to find out in fact which system (RX vs MTX) will suit you best. I bought the RX beam rack for commuting and because I wanted an easy install -which it is just a matter of alan wrenching onto your seat post. The reason for my so-so review is that once you choose to go with the RX or MTX system your locked into that product lineup. As a result I can only use the RX TrunkBag EX with its 2.8 L capacity or the RX TrunkBag DXP with 7.3 L capacity and the RX Defender (a rear fender), and some lights. The MTX lineup, however, has many more bags from the office bag to the basket etc... giving you many more selections to choose from. Beyond that here are some specs; E series EX fits seat posts 25.4 mm to 31.8 mm and has a max capacity of 15 lbs. While its made out of sturdy parts and will get the job done... the limited compatibility detracts from its overall worth. If I were to do it all over again I would have gone with the MTX series. Anyways, I'm going to use the rack and sketchily set up a milk crate again like the old days and hopefully that'll do it until I can get another one."

310446,0,This little shovel is perfect for digging your latrine but don't expect to move mountains with it. Also the spade is about the size of my hand so don't expect your latrine to be very big.
226756,1,This is a great light. I found it to be very bright even in smoke filled conditions. It is also very durable. It easily clips onto my jacket and stays secured while I'm working. The battery cover closes and seals tightly preventing water intrusion. I highly recommend this flashlight!
355544,2,"I was so pleased with the first shirt that I thought it would be wise to order a few more while they have free shipping.To my shock I received a mirror image shirt made out of a very thin polyester which wrinkles when washed.Sweat sticks to this one, not like the first one which was perfect for exercising.So, out of the shirts I receiveed only the first order was as stated.They others seem to be a cheap polyester knock-off.Very disappointing."
7979,0,"I would recommend this to someone who either wears baggy clothing or is planning to layer several articles of clothing underneath due to cold weather. I ordered a large size (which is the size I usually wear), and the shoulders of the product were about an inch or two too broad on either size. The joint where the arms connect to the trunk of the hoodie are huge (hence it looks baggy). Apart from the size issue, the product is great - it is soft on the inside and has a comfortable front pocket and hood."

153264,0,"The item is resilient, but not sure for how long. Other reviewer mentioned that the seam leaked after a while but I'll keep a close eye on mine and report my findings. It is possible he didn't have enough water to boil in it; thus cracking the enamelware making it leak. I test equipment like this in controlled areas to see how long they last and how they stand up to abuse.WARNING: The item must never be put over a hot surface (such as fire) without liquid food or water in it! Make sure to never put this item in cold water when hot, it will crack the enamel and your percolator will be useless.The percolator system itself is made of aluminum, can't really complain about that but may give your coffee or boiled water a ""metal"" taste. You'll need to buy some wrap-around coffee filters for tea, coffee, wild herbs but I think this product should have included a few filters free of charge."
99903,0,We bought our grill from a friend who was a gator fan :( So we had to get a new cover. I ordered this one. It is much thinner then the Gator cover. I guess if i never saw the other cover i wouldn't know that this is not nearly as good. But still we aren't going to use a gator cover and this one does its job.
28024,0,"I have a DMI airhockey table (without electronics) and am impressed with the quality and design, so I decided to purchase a foosball table for my kids. The table is also impressive to look at and the quality of the handles and players are great for this price range. The side rails that stick to the side of the playing surface are kind of a waste as they continually peel off and look ""cheap"", but the biggest problem is the electronic scoreboard- the connections keep falling apart and i had to try to tape the connections together and even then the electronics don't work. DMI offered to sent a new end piece to their credit."
28460,1,"Product seems rugged and reliable. I am pleased with the quality. I am pleased with the type of keying it has. I have no way to test its anti-theft capabilities because no one has tried to break it, and no one has tried to steal my bike as of now. The lock seems like an excellent lock. Hopefully its presence will act as a theft deterrent. Hopefully no one will try to steal my bike because the lock makes it seem too hard to steal my bike. Amazon did good on delivery. The lock is as described. Lock looks different then the photo as I recall the photo, but that is not a problem for me. No bad surprises using Amazon. I am pleased with this purchase in every way possible. I am pleased with Amazon in every way possible regarding this purchase."
299164,0,"Like others have mentioned, these goggles are for children. If I didn't need them to go snowboarding in a week, I would return them.

500261,1,"Whether you are a professional LEO (like me) or a security minded civilan, These holsters are the way to go. Mine arrived brand new in the box. It seems very sturdy and it's a two piece holster. Meaning if the paddle cracks (whihc does sometimes happen with age) you can unscrew the holster and just buy a new paddle.The holster is practical, since most new patrol rigs are now including the Serpa style push button release. This release button is easily accessible as a trained shooter will draw the firearm with their trigger finger extended alongside of the holster. I've shot LE competitions and civilian IDPA and found no difference in my speed when using this holster compared to level 1 retention rigs.More importantly it's comfortable, which means(at least for me) you'll carry a real gun more often, instead of a mouse gun.The holster is also VERY well priced. Similar holsters go for $50 at my local LE outfitters."
475061,2,Although this item is shown with the Omron HJ-151 the pedometer has no features available that will allow you to attach the strap
474540,1,"This water cage is very well constructed, strong, light, and perfectly painted. Another reviewer remarked about the missing hardware, but I'd like to point out that hardware is traditionally included with the bike so that the threaded holes aren't exposed, so there's no need for attachment makers to include hardware in most cases. I'll order these for all of my bikes in the future."

113986,1,"Overall a good comfy TALL-high sitting chair to take along on a trip. Provides great butt support and higher stool to relax your legs. Feels pretty stable for my 210Lb 6.4"" tall body.Not a simple-easy to carry along anywhere chair, kind of bulky and to heavy to carry on a walking trip/hike. Not the type of stool you wantto relax in for hours around the house, but a #1 pick for a quick resting seat....A GOOD item if your doing some campingor waiting in line on ""BLACK FRIDAY"" or possibly at a State Fair :> PLUS its cheaper + lighter then any Walmart portable chair.I PAID $12.59 got 2 with FREE shipping = A+ps... for a easy backpack carry etc I'd buy this ""Camouflage Folding Camp Stool"""
439129,0,"I ordered a ""Hunter green"" colored knife and I received a black one. I am disappointed.It's not worth shipping it back just for the color error. This is the first time Amazon has let me down."
481113,1,You'll lose them before you wear them out. No kidding.Bridgedale Trekkers last and last and last. They are also zone engineered to give the best support and blister resistance of any sock I've used.Rated five stars because there were not six!
326557,1,Got 3 of these for my dad for xmas and they were great! There are several varieties and different animals you can go with and my only suggestion would maybe be to get one with more of a pattern on it like a zebra or a skunk or something. When its all black like the panther one its a little hard to tell that it is supposed to be an animal. Overall though very good gift idea!
394389,1,"Shorts fit very well and are comfortable. They can shrink a little, so I dry them without the dryer, just by laying them flat, and they do dry quickly and retain their shape. I think they are better than the other comparable brands of this kind of short, like Soffe, and you really can't beat the price."

291326,1,"I wanted a tall water bottle to use when I am exercising. This one holds ample water, fits easily into the cup holders in my automobile and is dishwasher safe."
441310,1,"Overall it is a pretty good barrel. However it is only held together with one metal bar running through it. That means the more you take it on and off the looser it gets. Then the casing starts to shift around and the sights will be off. But it isn't that bad, if you can get past that."
241016,1,"this is a sharp looking tool and everything works well but the grips were wayyyy to far apart when gripping it. I have big hands so thats saying something. What I had to do was take my dremmel out and shave part of the metal stoppers that stops it from going all the way together. I took about 3mm off (on each side), it only took about 5 minutes. now it fits perfectly. it was so far apart it felt open while it was closed. I couldnt imagine having to open it up any further to grip onto something with the way it was. it was seriously uncomfortable. ill add pictures pointing out where I shaved the metal at. w/ before and afters"
247923,1,Very good product. It solved my ant problem quickly and easily. I would highly recommend this to anyone with any sort of ant problem.
105065,2,"We bought the T72 a few months ago. We had a used treadmill and decided we were ready to make the investment. Actually putting the thing together was not that easy because the holes did not match up on the hand rests. That aside though, we were ready to get started.The product worked great for several weeks and then the belt just stopped in the middle of a running workout. The computer kept working, but the belt didn't restart. When the machine was turned off and back on, it started up with no problem.The same thing happened several more times, so we called customer support only to discover they are only available from 8 till 5. So we sent an email. Several days later we get a response asking us to verify that it is on a ""dedicated 20 amp circuit."" We have since moved it to 5 different locations with no success.After another 3 phone calls and 3 different associates with a whole list of failed suggestions, a customer service rep said we might need a new drive motor. Since the part was on backorder, we must not be the only ones with this issue. They said the installation would be easy but that they could send a tech if needed.The installation was NOT easy, so we called for a rep. (Isn't that why we pay for the warranty?) We were set up with a 4 hour time slot the next day. Three hours into that time slot, we got a call saying the tech couldn't make it. We were told he'd be here somewhere between 8 and 5 the next day.We are now out countless hours troubleshooting this ourselves, plus several phone calls and emails, and two days of work all to get a treadmill working that has been sitting in our home (paid for and warrantied) for several months.I would not waste my time on Horizon Fitness. I think that if the product works, you'll have a good experience with the treadmill, but if you need help... you won't find much customer service. I'm not saying this to be hateful; just trying to save other buyers the headache."
19419,0,The product seems like it works best if you are already in shape. I would recommend using this once you have made progress at the gym first.
467702,0,"This is a mouth guard that is heat fit by boiling. The guard is large and takes some getting used to..and I don't mean the usual drool or saliva issues thats normal, I mean its feel in you mouth is large and will press you gumswhere the edge rolls in..(see the picture). that said once your used to the feel it does a good job and absorbs blows well My bite felt less rattled by hard hits and continued use has allowed the piece to feel better in my mouth. The unit is fit by boiling to soften and then biting down to mold to you mouth features. This took some effort and thankfully it can be refit by simply reheating it if your bite feels wrong. A good product but the boiling is touchy to get right so follow the instuctions to the letter , take your time, and bite down hard when fitting.So concluding one star lost for the fitting of the round edges...my gums hated this, and 1/2 star for the touchy boil fitting...but I would by again and I would recommend as a mouth guard."

279472,0,This was a great bed until the chambers started to dissapate. The 4 chambers became 3 chambers and a hard 4th on and then another one started dissipating as well... It's just not ment to be used as an everyday bed... Otherise it was a spectacular bed!!!
256641,0,"This is the essential anchor to the bicycle that your rear rack will need to have a solid positioning on the back of your ride. It works beautifully once it's on...""once it's on"" being the operative word!I purchased a late-seventies English Racer (3 speed) to be my errand and basic bike for getting around the city. When I went to attach this to my rear rack, I found that there was no proper hole for me to attach through, and had to drill a completely new one! If you do not have access to a power drill, you may be in a bind!I knocked off one star for the lack of proper hole, and another because I fail to understand why this is not automatically included hardware for the rear rack.I will post a picture showing the location of the new hole soon."
294700,1,"The pillow is just large enough to be comfortable for camping, while at the same time being light and small enough that carrying it backpacking is comfortable too. I have no complaints with this pillow. Great product, great comfort"
288280,0,I like being able to purchase gloves in so many colors but have found the life of these gloves is short. Wear on the palm quickly.
256500,1,This product arrived in a very quickly after ordering. It was well packaged and in perfect condition. I was very happy with the quality of the fabric and stitching and it was well-worth the price! It was a gift for a relative who lives in Utah and he was delighted with it.
28564,1,"So far, the lock has worked flawlessly. This is my first u-lock so I can't compare. I didn't bother with the mounting bracket since I don't know where it would fit with my water bottle cages. Lock is VERY heavy, shipping weight was 5 lbs. Only gripe I have with it is the cylinder, which I can pull by hand and a small 2mm gap appears between the black padded parts and the silver keyhole cover part. I'm not sure if that's natural or how it will hold up if someone were to go at it with tools."
79681,0,"The first one was perfect in that you could incorporate fitness equipment you had on hand. This one used the Wii Fit Board...I like that...and the Wii remote to track your progress. Sometimes you swear you are doing it right, and it doesn't pick it up. There is no other way to change the difficulty level other than start a new profile. I like the addition of live people as the trainers, but I wish the instructions were a bit more detailed for each excercise. I like it, but don't love it. They should have worked on it a bit more and made it more like the original but updated. I'd save my cash and get EA Fit or Wii Fit Plus. The shopping list/meal planner and the fact it weighs you are a definite plus, but not enough to make it worth the [...]."
113584,2,The belt is very light weight and not a solid good belt for professionals. I would not buy this item again and have no use for it.
132291,0,"Although this was a nice shoe and along the lines of what I was looking for, I ordered this in the Espresso/Brown combination and it was hemp, not suede. Take a close look at the color swatch on-line. If it looks like canvas, it is."

461045,2,I ordered in 2 different sizes. Neither of them inflated all the way and remained soft. I used the pump that it came with. The second balls I ordered looked used too. And the only color that was available was steel grey that looked very drabby in person.

391586,0,"I recently got this heart monitor to use during P90X cardio workouts. It seems to work OK when I'm sitting still and taking a resting heart rate (it's just about equal to a manual pulse reading), the problems start when I do anything that involves moving (especially my upper body.) It seems like the straps that are supposed to be in contact with my skin on my chest to detect my heart rate move around a little bit (even on the tightest setting), and my heart rate fluctuates like crazy accordingly (for example, today it read over 190 bpm at a point where I was no doubt sweating and working hard, but I was not THAT winded and probably could have passed the ""talk test"".)I can see how on men, who have flatter and broader chests/midsections, this would not be an issue. But on myself (and perhaps other women), the thicker battery compartment (that says Timex on the front) sits on my sternum/ribcage, but there are small gaps on either side of the compartment between the chest sensors and my skin (i.e., it doesn't lay flat; it eventually comes to lay flat closer to the elastic strap itself towards the sides of my ribcage.)I also would NOT believe the calorie counts it puts out (although it's presumably more accurate if it is recording your heart rate accurately). Kenpo X is a fairly intense 1 Hr long kickboxing workout, but I still don't think I burned the 827 calories it claimed that I did (I wish!!).I'd recommend one better suited to a woman's narrower shape than this."
203398,1,Surprisingly good value and the size fit my small frame perfectly. The soft fleece-like fabric on the inside keeps you warm yet cleverly wicks away moisture so you're not soaked in your own sweat. Seriously thinking of getting another one.

33445,0,"I'm a guy and Colonial white doesn't mean anything to me. The picture was white so I figured it would be white. Well, let me tell you, Colonial White is a brownish-yellow. If you don't care about having a brownish-yellow cover on your propane tanks and the price is cheap then this is the cover for you. If you want a white cover to match 95% of the campers out there then you better pay the extra money and get what you want. It seems well constructed and has a real handy opening in the top to turn the tanks on-off, but it is brownish-yellow. I hope this helps in your decision."
140883,0,"These lugs crimp okay but no better than others and are not 100%. I had to crimp using the proper tool several times on one of the lugs out of four in order to get it to hold sufficiently.

308081,0,"Not bad for the price however a few flaws in the design.1) It has a twist knob which can be very difficult to use while hands are soapy. Had to tie extra loop knot to hang the hose from, so didn't need to close off everytime.2) The spout port to fill the bag leaks while heating in the sun3) Left bag i direct sun for over 4 hours and water was luke warm (but warmer than the river water)All in all, sub $10 not a terrible buy."

All the time I am looking at this giant box I am saying, ""What in the world could this be?""It was so crazy and funny that there was no way that I was going to send it back.Since I do not have a boat or a friend with a boat I have no practical use for the item except as a conversation piece.So a week or two after my experience I see someone making the news where they received an assault rifle after ordering a computer monitor.Anyway...

393265,0,"I'm quite sure the leash on this will be the first thing to go. It's not the thicker string like what you see attached to the board, it's a softer, weaker material. Also, it wasn't looped so I could easily attach, it was cut instead so it had two ends and I had to tie it. I thought that was maybe cut on accident, but the ends are sealed up slightly (like when you burn the ends) so it looks like that was the intention. I knocked one star off for that and one more for the price because at the current price (35 bucks) there are better boards on Amazon. I recommend the Airwalk Swell because the board itself feels a bit sturdier, the leash is much better, and the price is within a few bucks."
469758,0,"I bought Roland Dr. Beat Metronome after reading reviews on Amazon. My sons needed one for their piano practice at home.

They are 8 and 10. I am hoping after a little more time with it and a little more help they will be able to use it fully without any help."
306857,1,Nice cotton t-shirt. The 6.1 oz cotton is a little heavier/thicker than the fabric of most T's. Size runs small which is typical for Hanes t-shirts.
360914,2,"CONS:1. Incorrect hardware: Like other reviewers, the nuts and bolts do not seem to be the best.2. Harms surface. One side that holds on to other side of the wall has a very abrasive surface which will mar any paint/finish. This material was probably chosen to prevent slippage, however rubber might've worked as well.PROS:1. Cheaper than others.CONCLUSION:For the price it's okay, but I don't think it's going to last 2+ years of daily use. Very annoying was the hardware provided which doesn't seem to match the description in the user manual."
439678,0,"When it works, it works pretty good.You can select various modes by the # times pressed: (1) high, (2) medium, (3) low, &amp; (4) strobe.Unfortunately, the push on/off doesn't seem to always register. Not sure if it's a design defect, or just a defective unit. Once in a while it stays on, and you have to remove batteries to turn off. And sometimes it won't turn on, and you have to wait a while, almost as if it has to reset itself. ???Because of it's occasional tempermental nature, I deduct a couple stars (assuming it's not a design defect). If not for that, it would receive a perfect score :)Wonder if anyone else has this problem ?NOTE: if it is a design defect, I'd deduct more."

191997,1,"I've had my mountain hardwear windstopper for 3 or 4 years and could not be more pleased. This jacket works well under a variety of conditions. My primary use for this jacket is for skiing in New England. It works great layered under a shell in mid-winter, and is particularly good by itself for spring skiing due to its great wind stopping ability. I also wear it around town running errands as well as on winter hikes and have never been cold. I have even climbed a few mountains in it, and it is warm enough for the top, yet cool enough (with the pit zips open) for the bottom. I also prefer the more rugged styling of the MH fleece to the softer look of the North Face Denali, though I doubt this jacket will ever catch on with the fashionistas.when (if) this one wears out, I am sure I will get another.One last thing to note is the fit. You will find that this jacket is more form fitting than many fleeces, so if you're not in good shape, especially around the middle, this jacket will show it! caveat emptor!"
171357,0,"Let me first say that my top two choices were the Trident and the Cold Steel Recon 1 and I almost immediately regretted going with the SOG when I opened it up and started playing with it. First, the SOG is too thick for a pocket knife...much thicker than my current EDC Spiderco with the same size blade also made out of Zytel. While I like the idea of a lower profile pocket clip, the design on the SOG causes the pant pocket to go up over the top of the knife making it very difficult to pull it out of your pants. It gets so hard to pull out the knife that you think you are going to rip your pants. Then again, at least you aren't worried about losing it. I was also disappointed at how hard it it to open the SOG blade one handed as there is a lot of friction at the beginning before the assist starts. Maybe this will loosen up with use. There is also a little side to side blade play...I don't think that this will affect the intended use but I was surprised that SOG had this play...my Spiderco does not. You may like the lock feature on the knife that prevents it from opening, but I find it a completely useless feature that gets snagged on your pants and locks up unintentionally. I have carried some form of a pocket knife my entire life for over 30years and I have never had a pocket knife open up accidently so I have no clue why a company would even put a blade lock on a pocket knife. Most pocket knives that I have seen maintain the same size metal across the spine or back of the blade so I was surprised that the back of the SOG blade starts thick where it connects to the handle but tapers to a thin point at the tip, which concerns me about the blade breaking in half if put under any kind of stress. Only time will tell.There are also things that I do like about the SOG, such as the tiger strip blade...especially if the finish holds up. It is just plain cool and very sharp out of the box. I like the thump grooves on the back of the blade by the handle for added control. I like the ingenious handle slot for cutting small rope or fishing line...even if I hardly ever use it. I like how light the knife is with the Zytel handle as it makes it much more comfortable to carry instead of a heavy weighted item in your pocket. I know first hand how strong this material is as my Spiderco has lasted 15years made out of Zytel without a single problem, and still going strong. Yeah, I know it feels a little like cheap plastic and I don't like the seams showing on the back of the handle, but this stuff is super durable, strong and light. SOG makes a quality product, but this pocket knife just isn't for me. I also wanted a SOG fixed blade seal pup so maybe I will exchange this knife for that."
273821,1,"I love these pants. They are very comfortable and the elastic waistband isn't as tight as my other Tiger Claw pants. The waffle fabric is soft and will get softer the more they are washed. The only negative is that there is a Tiger Claw logo embroidered on the right thigh. I never buy clothes with logos, so if I had the option, I would oder the pants sans logo."

278811,0,"I can't really complain too much about this mask since it was pretty cheap. I bought it primarily because it was one of the cheaper masks that protects the top and back of your head and also to supplement a mask that came as part of a bundle, thinking (and rightly so) that the bundle mask would be junk.Construction is pretty cheap; extremely flexible plastic. The removable top took some wrestling to get it into place, and I'm not going to put much faith in that it will stay on the field.Fit was a little snug - my hat size is 7 and a quarter inches. This is definitely not a mask that you can whip on and off quickly.Previous reviewers described what seem to be randomly placed 1/8th inch holes right above the ears. This was also true on my mask. I'm assuming they're for rivets to hold the top and face together, but the rivets weren't placed.Lastly, the silver accent piece on the mouth is held on by small plastic tabs, and it falls off consistently. Gives the whole thing a really cheap feel.All in all, it's probably worth what I paid, probably does a good job at protecting my face, but will probably get spray painted fun designs to be a novelty mask. I don't think I'll purchase a mask online again. It seems like one of the pieces of equipment you should put considerable thought and money into."
206802,1,"The fieldmaster by Victorinox has all the blades I want in a knife and the quality one would expect from Victorinox. For those who do not know what the hook on the bottom is for... it is for carrying a load with a cord handle so the cord won't cut into your hand, or grabbing the wire handle of a hot pot off a fire without burning yourself. This knife makes the crossover from woods to urban environment."

125895,1,"I've had my Vector for a couple years now. Didn't really wear it till I joined the Army over a year ago, though. I'm in the Infantry and it's been through a lot of tough conditions and is still going strong. Still the original band, showing no signs of distress. I replace the battery about every year and a half when the warning comes up.I LOVE the barometric pressure trend window on the face, let's me know at a glance if we're getting good weather or bad while out on a mission. You will wonder how you ever got a long without it.The compass is surprisingly accurate if calibrated regularly and cross-checked against known points. You can quick-access the compass by just pushing one button--great for getting a quick bearing while yr on the move, just make sure it's away from ferrous metals, of course. Much faster than trying to pull out my real compass. The bubble-level built into the face is great for that extra-level of accuracy that I've come to expect from Suunto.The altimeter isn't as dependable in my opinion. But, Suunto makes it extremely easy to correct it to known elevation in about 3 seconds. I typically reset it every morning when I know my elevation, but it deviates too much in my opinion throughout the day.It's also got the thermometer. You can set it for metric or english units, but it's kind of a pain to do it. (Suunto, it would be nice to make a one-touch button to switch back and forth.) Oh, and obviously it does military time, too.Yes, it's a big watch, but the crystal is actually plastic, so it is extremely light and comfortable to wear. Despite being plastic and being through all the sand/dirt/rocks, etc., my watch face has very little scratching at all.There are more features I love about this watch, but I hit the main ones here. I didn't like this watch till I actually started wearing it in the Army."
500507,2,"Do not buy this holster if you have a Taurus PT1911 as although the 1911 goes in smooth enough it does not come out. It's not the trigger guard retention, the holster internal size is too snug. I had to resort to employing a dremel cutting wheel along the top of the holster to free my gun and in the process slightly nicked the same. As mine is polished stainless I'll have to do some research on how to polish the top of the slide to remove the blemish.Pros: the price and it is well made.Cons: although listed to fit a 1911 with or without rail, it does NOT work for the Taurus PT1911 with rail.As I had to destroy the holster to save my gun, (liberally pouring oil down the inside did not work)I basically wasted the price of the holster and damaged my prize 1911 in the process. Understandably I am quite disgusted with this product and can not recommend it to anybody for a Taurus PT1911"
245779,1,"WARNING!!!!!!!! THIS WILL BECOME YOUR NEW FAVORITE!! no other long sleeve t-shirt can compare with these SUPREME Russel brand shirts. it is so universal you can wear it for anything for any task and looks and feels great too and it has great quality which can last for years to come. its so comfortable and loose you don't have to worry about the texture or fit because the description and pic on amazon is accurate. buy this product in your size, your actual shirt size because these shirts are a little looser. please guys do not pull hard or stretch these because first when you wash it for the first time it will shrink about 1/10 of its actual size, however even though the fabric is a cotton/polyester blend so it has some elasticity to it the material can be permanently stretched if forced enough though-but it maintains it shape great but you have the option of stretching it to fit your preference if you got long arms or something, normally most people are OK with this. THE KEY POINT OF THESE SHIRTS ARE THE DIRIBILITY AND QUALITY."
155708,1,"When I started working out last year, my husband got me a strapless heart rate monitor. It was big and bulky and I needed to press two buttons to get a reading. It also didn't track calories. It was very good for making sure my heart rate wasn't going too high. (When you're in your forties, those things become important.)A few months ago, I learned that some heart rate monitors actually track the calories burned during a workout. I started researching and brought my choices down to the Polar F4 and a Reebook model that was strapless. I was hesitant to get a model with a chest strap because I thought it might be uncomfortable. I decided to take a chance on the Polar and am so glad I did.The monitor is really easy to use. You can use your computer to change the settings on it. It continuously tracks your heart rate and calories burned during a workout session. It keeps track of and totals a week's worth of workouts. This is probably my best fitness purchase ever."
399337,0,"The shipping on this item was lightening fast--I ordered one afternoon and they were at my front door when I was leaving the house the next morning. The glasses are attractive and I love the polarization, but they are very uncomfortable in hot weather. There is no ventilation with these things, and you end up with sweaty eyes and fogged lenses. I haven't returned them because the price was decent and they do serve a purpose, e.g. when driving in a climate-controlled car. But there's no way I could use these as sport sunglasses."

I love that I don't have to open the bottle -- I can just flip the straw. I was really disappointed in a few things, though... Mildew grew all throughout the bottle even though I wash it regularly. Getting mildew out of the straw and bite valve was very difficult. The bite valve doesn't lay flush with the top of the bottle and water leaked out. When the straw/bite valve are up, water leaks out of the top. Not just a little water. A lot of water. I have spilled plenty of water down my shirt front and on my keyboard, and my car seat has been thoroughly soaked. It's pretty obnoxious. And a final comment re: design. I wish the bottle fit in the car drink holder. Overall, I love having the bottle. I just wish it didn't leak."

382323,1,"After reading the reviews you would have thought people spent $50 bucks on this toy. It is now clearanced to 6.99. Many people said they only had a couple days of use out of it before it broke. Well, I'd gladly pay 6.99 to entertain my three kids for two days. It sure beats the $100 bucks it would take for the same enjoyment for two hours at Chuck E. Cheeses. People don't seem to mind ""waisting"" their money on something like that which entertains for a couple hours, but they expected a mylar baloon to last a lifetime. If you go to a party shop and purchase a huge mylar balloon it'll cost you about $5 or more and deflates in a day or so...plus you can't use it like a frisbee either. I agree that the 12.99 price may have been a bit steep for the glorified balloon, but 6.99 is worth a days fun in my book."

140090,0,"I got this and was really let down. I didn't get an effective workout from it due to the fluidity, or lack thereof, of the program. Each time you change activities, the tutorial pops up along with instructions for the Wii controller. Also, during some of the workouts, like squats, the nunchuck needs to be positioned perfectly or the game doesn't register your motion. This constantly had me shifting around the controllers and skipping through tutorials. I spent more time standing than moving.I didn't like that is doesn't track your progress in any way or suggest what workouts might be best for you. Some of it was fun, but it just wasn't doing enough to actually tone me up or lose weight. I ended up going back to Fitness Coach (Wii version of Yourself Fitness) for a better, more effective, workout."

264172,2,"I have owned this shower for about three years. The first yar it was fine buwas expensive to run becuase of batteries and bottle fuel. After storage over the winter (in a heated space) it took about one day to get it going again. You will need an air compressor to clean the burners. If they have ANY material such as spider webs, dust, etc. they will not burn properly. The pump is very simple but temperamental. Over the storage period, any accumulation or hardening of grease, sludge, etc. will stop the impeller. The battery connections in the case become fatigued over time and don't make a circuit. Any moisture(from the shower etc Duh!) will corrode the contacts requiring sand paper to clean.I fabricated a hose connection to supply water from a domestic system. It worked to provide 40 PSI pressure and flow but the heat disappeared. Seems you have to throttle the flow to no more than 1 gpm in order to get the proper heat transfer. A one burner Hot Tap will only raise the waters temeperature 20 degrees. If you have 50 degree river water, you get 70 degree hot water MAX. That is about 25 degrees body temperature. It still is a brisk shower.If you are willing to to fuse with the shower everytime you want to use it, it is an OK product but when i go camping I want to spend my time enjoying myself, not fixing stuff. Use a solare shower and carry 2 or 3. If there is sun, they are foolproof.One good point, the telephone support is good if you can get to a real person. One very important proceedure is to turn the burners off BEFORE the water. You can burn up the copper coil very quickly. A well written user manual and trouble shooting section would be very helpful."

Of course our first day to the beach with our daughter was windy, but we didn't think it would pose that big of a challenge. However, it did. It took my husband about 20-25 minutes to get it set up. Even when it was up, staked down, and bagged down with sand, it kept blowing away (mind you it wasn't THAT windy!). We had to put our cooler, beach chair and bag in it just to get it to stand up without blowing away.Overall the tent is GREAT, if not using it on a windy day. It has wonderful ventilation with the windows so you never get hot if sitting inside. And the size is great for 2 adults or a bunch of kids!"

It for sure works better once it is a little damp which is not problem during an Astanga class!"
320498,0,"I bought this watch because it was relatively inexpensive, had a large display, and a decent look.The functionality of the watch is pretty simple: Time, Run (e.g. the stopwatch), and Data (see total workout time and individual lap times). I wish in Run mode I could toggle the behavior: whenever you hit ""lap,"" the timer starts again from 00:00. In some cases this is really nice (you're doing laps and want to compare easily), but you have to switch to Data mode to see your total workout time.The other comment is that the watch is angled and hence can really only be worn on the left wrist.Rating this as 3* mainly because I'm about to send it in for its 2nd warranty service (yay for the 2 year warranty though). This is the 2nd time the Start/Lap and Stop buttons have stopped functioning, but only in Run mode, which is very odd."

After going over initial safety rules with him, I've had no misgivings about letting him jump like a wild man on this trampoline - it's very sturdy and solid.My husband and I have both bounced on it as well; it's entirely appropriate for adults looking to exercise, very stable.Plus, the price was a bargain & shipping free with Amazon Prime.

39255,0,"I bought these for the same reason as everybody - be able to work out quickly and easily at home for WAY less money than buying separate dumbbells - and they DO the job for that certainly.But two problems:1) A minor drop, and they broke. And yes yes yes- whoever drops a dumbbell. I certainly never had before, but this was like a half-drop not far off the ground, and some of the PLASTIC plates broke in the handle. Now only certain configurations work. Still usable and I'm still using them, but I would not buy again just because of this.2) and more importantly - you'll run out of weight!! Ok, I'm not up to biceps curls above 52.5 lbs, but certainly bent row and bench press and other important ones you'll want to cover will leave these dumbbells in the dust after not too long. I knew this before I bought but was in denial. Now, to buy just a single set of 60 lb dumbbells (the next set up after the Selectech runs out) is around $150 bucks!Check out PowerBlocks - the elite set. It goes up to 90 lb per hand and looks just as compact!!"

It is uncomfortable to use the open sights. The bipod, red dot scope and extra barrel are all useless. The silencer looks great but does nothing. I don't think anyone under 14 would be strong enough to pull the spring back (some may). Generally if you put a scope on it and get it sighted in it is good enough for a $50 gun. Don't get me wrong gun is great, but buy for the gun and not the accesories or you'll be disapointed."

411034,0,"When this bike was delivered and put together as instructed, not only was the bottle holder broken and unusable, but the computer did not work. When inspecting the packaging, we notice the computer was packed in a box that was flimsy and not protected by foam, the only protection was the cardboard carton and that was quite dented. The bike was covered by Styrofoam, why not the computer?A great deal of time was spent assembling this to discover at the last minute there was no workable computer. When I called, rather then just send a new computer, we had to dismantle the bike, pack it up, and wait for it to be picked up. Of course by that time, Amazon was out of the bike and we had to wait for a new one to be sent.When the new bike came, we noted the computer still had little protection from possible shipping mishaps, but this one does work.The bike is nice, though a little hard to mount with ease. The programming instructions are easy to understand.I would have rated this bike 4 1/2 stars, if it hadn't been for all the work of assembling it, taking it down, waiting for a new one etc. When all that was needed to make this right, was to simply ship a new computer in exchange for the old one."

333438,0,"Set up is easy enough, and although the lines are not adjustable, I have made do by knotting the corners in a bit to make for a smaller (doubles) court. Be careful of rope burns if you dive or trip on the lines, though. Because they are ropes and not 1-inch or 2-inch lines, it can be quite painful. I'd almost rather buy ropes from Home Depot or Walmart or something, because the quality would be about the same, but it's be a lot less costly. I went with these lines because I was lazy and I wanted the anchors and the plastic reel in one package, but after using it for about 6 months, I wish I hadn't wasted my money. The 1-inch or 2-inch lines are much easier to see at all times, but particularly in the evening.My advice: spend a little more money and go with 1-inch or 2-inch lines.

I wasn't expecting it to work at all, but it's worked better than anything else at keeping me exercising.

390945,1,"I bought two of these, one for a 20"" bike and one for a 12"" bike. They both fit fine, although there is no room to adjust the wheels to be farther from the ground on the 12"" bike. The training wheels are very sturdy and installed easily."
329616,0,the grey are kinda see thru. I have a feeling my junk is on display so wear underwear is a must. I like to be free under my gym shorts and the black ones are great.

301756,1,"I don't collect watches but tend to find one that I want to wear for a long time. The inexpensive watch associated with a Swiss cutlery company that I had died and I wanted a better, more rugged watch that would look good and live through what I would throw at it. I decided to go back to Seiko Divers watches, fell for this one and am VERY happpy. I am a large framed person so the size of the watch isn't too much on my wrist and I know that this one will last me a long time."
329680,2,"I must admit, I was attracted to the item because of the price but you get what you pay for! The pieces which attach to the bike were not bent correctly and I am so disappointed!This company should be ashamed for putting together such a shoddy product. ..."

284898,1,"This cushion arrived exactly as described. It is firm enough to give long-lasting support yet molds to your body better than simply sitting on the ground. It is a bit bulky to take with you on trips and what not, but is perfect for meditation practice at home.The cloth seems durable and the handle makes it easy to move around. This zafu is very easy to use and is great for my use (daily meditation)."
235786,0,"I bought this to help build some strength in my forearms that was vey convenient. I figured it would help with lifting weights. Something you can pick up and do quickly. Thats true, its not much the distraction but the resistance is limited. I can use it on the maximum tension for a long time maybe around 10 min or more. Im sure it will help. I imagine it would help for sports a bit but I doubt it would be worth it to build muscle"
398086,0,"My wife and I recently decided to upgrade our living room set. Our kids, now gown and off starting their own lives, had ruined the previous set we got as a wedding gift in 1984 over the years. We loved our living room set, but realized after careful consideration that it was time to part ways with the beloved furniture.After several failed attempts to find what we were looking for, one of our children suggested we look on Amazon. It was here that we thought we found the solution to all of our seating needs--the Vip Bleacher 10 Row/140 Seat/21'-Fence. Though not your typical couch or love seat, this piece reminded my wife and I of a simpler time. We remembered the lovely modern styles of our parents houses and thought it would really make our house feel like a home again with a subtle reminder of our long lost and fading youth. Seemingly prudent--the Vip Bleacher 10 Row/140 Seat/21'-Fence comes with built in safety features, such as the convenient 21'-Fence--and offering a wide variety of seating options from its vast selection of 140 seats and 10 rows, the Vip Bleacher 10 Row/140 Seat/21'-Fence seemed like the perfect fit for our empty nest.The price tag was certainly a negative aspect of the Vip Bleacher 10 Row/140 Seat/21'-Fence, but my wife and I, after applying for a reverse mortgage to use the equity in our home to pay for retirement expenses, decided that the price, though steep, was acceptable. Shipping was an added expense, as this was not covered by Amazon Prime. When the Vip Bleacher 10 Row/140 Seat/21'-Fence arrived, it ended up being incredibly inconvenient to unload the large hauler in our suburban neighborhood. With the help of the majority of the neighbors, however, we were able to unload the Vip Bleacher 10 Row/140 Seat/21'-Fence and move it into our house. It was then that we began to realize that the Vip Bleacher 10 Row/140 Seat/21'-Fence appeared much more space efficient on Amazon, and though we were expecting 140 seats, the true scope of the number hadn't dawned on us until that point.After removing a section of wall and ceiling from our home we were able to assemble the Vip Bleacher 10 Row/140 Seat/21'-Fence with relative ease. As for the hole in the house, we were surprised to find that around the time of our purchase our personal finances were quite strained and we were unable to make the necessary repairs to either return our living room to its former state or cover the hole. For now we have resorted to covering our living room with the16' X 20' Blue Multi-Purpose 6-mil Waterproof Poly Tarp Shade Cover 16x20 Tarpaulin by Grizzly Tarps.Pros: Vip seating. Mix-and-match living room arrangements. Convenient urban style fence for safety. Works with you as you age and cannot climb as far. All in one seating.Cons: Will require home remodeling, and a spacious area for unloading. I wouldn't recommend this product for apartments or trailer homes. Price, especially when compared to other living room sets. Does not come with cushions or fabric."
479150,0,"I have always purchased Russell teeshirts for my husband. However, these have drastically changed over the years. They were quite heavy and wore very well. The ones I recently purchased are no where near the quality of Russell T's I have purchased in the past. I can only assume they will not where as well. I gave them 3 stars because they are better then most of the colored teeshirts out there."
434498,0,I bought this for a birthday party my daughter attended where bathing caps were required. She is 6 years old and has long curly hair. It kept popping off because it was so tight.
39664,0,I didn't really expect anything more of this vest when I got it. I thought it was a good sturdy vest but I thought it had some flaws. One flaw would be that it's a little heavy for an airsoft vest. I'm 15 so it's not like I'm 12 saying that. It's also made for taller players because it was a little big on me. It fit my 6'1 friend pretty good so if ur small like me I wouldn't recommend getting it.

31930,1,"This is a really long strap, great for taller people and men in particular. I bought this for my husband and am going to get a shorter one for myself. The fabric is great; natural fiber, very strong, good colour, well made."

354207,1,"I was looking for a shoe that was light and durable and that Kung Fu masters wear, after a little research I found these to be the standard. These are not your average canvas shoes, 10 months into wearing them they look practically new, I have put these shoes through the ringer walking and climbing in all types of weather on all types of terrain. They have a sticky rubber sole that extends about a 1/2 in. up the side and completely around the top of the tow and they are very light weight and flexible, so they are ideal for rock clambering, skating, free running, and kicking people in the face. That said they have a very thin insole and I highly recommend getting a gel insole or something like that (upping the cost $20 or $30), as the insole is thin you can also feel a lot of the ground you walk on, I can distinguish different pebbles from each other and even cracks on the sidewalk, these are things that I kinda wanted though so it in no way detracts from my enjoyment of the shoe. Its an awesome shoe, and even though after about 10 miles of hiking I could really use a break I feel more grounded on the hike than I ever have. This will probably be my go to shoe for the rest of my life, until hover shoes come out then I'll probably just wear those all the time."
109318,2,"I don't know why I always keep going back to Under Armour- I'm left largely unsatisfied with my purchases. To say it directly, the quality of their stuff just isn't all THAT great. At least not for the prices they charge. I got this for $12, which is fine, but much like their compression gear, it RIDES UP and NEVER stays in place. Ever.I don't have this problem nearly as much with other brands like Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and even stuff purchased at Walmart (Starter) and Target (Champion).The material of UA's products is too thick and smooth, so it's constantly riding up on me when I'm doing anything.Sorry, but UA seems to be more flash than substance, and that's coming from someone who owns a hell of a lot of it."
270227,0,"I really loved that watch, it is very comfortable and light weight, you even forget you are wearing it. It is easy to read the numbers and I liked the blue light when using the light button at night. I might be faulty of using this button too much though, but I went swimming, snorkeling and diving in sea-salt waters many times with my watch on, which the watch can support, and during a night dive, I hit the light button and the watch filled with fog... I bought the exact same watch again, and about 2 years later it came out of the shower all foggy again, although I did not hit a button that time ! Cannot see the numbers anymore... Sadly I am now shopping for another brand of sport water-resistant digital watch..."
417297,1,"My son received this as a first birthday gift. He LOVES it! Right now we are using the ""rock"" feature. I love the fact that it serves three purposes, rocker, ride-on, then tricycle. You'll never have to buy another ride-on until your child is big enough for a bicycle so this is a huge value in the long run if you add up what you'd spend on buying three separate riding toys before a bicycle.I can attest to this toy's durability because I have a 5 year old and a lot of other kids in and out of my house. It has been test drove, jumped on, sat on, and broken in by them all, including some adults trying to be funny. It has stood up to all the abuse.The only thing I might question is the plastic tires, I wonder how long they'll hold up once the toy is taken outside onto a rough surface. I guess that remains to be seen but for now we are thrilled with this toy."
55553,1,"This is an easy tent to set up and take down, for it's size that's a really good thing. There is so much space in this tent, it's great if you have kids, dogs, or just a lot of stuff! We used it the last 3 weekends and it worked awesome. I have yet to experience it in a rainstorm, and we haven't waterproofed it yet. I will have to get to that before it's too late."

334970,0,"I wouldn't buy this again, I ride road and have competed for the past 6 months. Have had the pump for 18 months. It is easy to use and has a great warranty, but I find its not that great for getting tubes to high pressures like 120psi, it squeaks and leaks at these pressures (ok till it gets to 100psi in my experience). Is great for the kids bikes and my mountain bike, but if you want a pump for very hi pressure road tyres, I wouldn't recommened this one."

68585,2,"I hate the idea of adding another key to my key chain, so a combo lock is great. I don't know why Kryptonite goes to such great lengths to make a secure U lock, but make the opening button so flimsy. It basically fell off after two weeks. So we hot glued it into its little hole, and it stayed for the better part of a month. After that, the button got lost, and the only way to open it is to use something like an awl to push the hole to the side. Useless...I'll check out the other combo U locks available..."
160408,1,"They are beautiful and comfy. The only issue was the SIZE but I knew about this by reading the reviews so my order was fine. I'm a size 8 and the 7 fits me perfect. I thought I was gonna get the pink wheels but mine are more of a hot pink which I LOVE. They are sturdy and hold all 140lbs of me lol. And the breaks are rubber-like, not plastic like I read somewhere else. I haven't used them outside yet, but I have been having fun running around the house with them. I would definately recommend these skates to any and everyone, especially considering the price! But make sure you get it from Amazon. Returns are easy if you must and they are just more professional."
23583,0,This was a good cheap helmet but had to re-glue the inside headstrap over time...it did what it was supposed to do and that is to protect our daughter during biking.
480111,0,Shirt was smaller than expected.. Quality was average. I was expecting better from this brand. Would not recommend to a friend.
37669,0,Had to return. Seemed to be a slim cut. Bought for husband in Large. He has several Large vests by Columbia but this Large had to be returned. It looked like a ladies cut.
60999,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed. Thank you ladies, for your review comments, as I rely on these to make my purchases."
63294,1,I bought a stick on Amazon. I got a stick in the mail. Simple as that.It's a good stick. Solid. Could use it to beat somebody up if you wanted. But don't. That's bad.It's a pretty shade of light brown. Will look good on the boat.
463046,1,This has been a great addition for my daughters lunch. She doesn't really like sandwiches so it was always a struggle of what to fix her for school lunches. This product has worked wonders and she actually eats her lunch now!! Thanks to a great product!!
240613,0,"I bought the tee to sleep in, but the texture just a little too rough for sleeping, for me. But it's a nice daytime tee. It doesn't seem to shrink in the wash, so that's a plus."
137712,0,This case is great. It fits tight and protects the phone well. The only problem is when taking pictures that require a flash. All pictures come out with a pink tint to them.
261160,0,"For the price, these aren't a bad value. I needed a sandwedge in my bad, but figured I'd give some other high loft clubs a try. These certainly aren't the highest quality clubs ever made, but so far I'm happy with the few times I've had to use them (so far)."
426676,0,"I bought this from another place and not on here. I used this tonight on a guy who was drunk and high on pot and probably meth. I dont recommend the twist and press this has. It jammed 3 times during the almost complete empty of this. It worked ok for the guy being high, but i had to resort to a torque wrench instead when it stopped being effective. I have a larger flip top version of this and it is much easier and faster to use. It shot a decent stream at about 10 feet. No blow back onto my face but i dont know which direction the wind was blowing either.Overall the spray is good. I just dont like and am not comfortable with how you use it. My opinion, get the flip top."
22818,1,"I use it exclusively for the gym but I'm sure it is adaptable to other uses. A extremely well-made bag, with neat features like the external ipod pocket."
393080,2,"Like the title says it plainly, it feels weird, like there's literally a thick plastic bag in the inside, also, it's not made with quality, so it starts to open up rather quickly, I'm thinking that's the reason for the plastic bag inside. Also, weird assorted colors. Mine came with the colors of the Gay Pride flag, so yes it's kind of awkward.Want a good hacky sack? Buy one made with sand instead of beans.Just an honest opinion. Cheers!"
417612,0,"I just assembled this for my two year old.Be prepared when you unpack it, you will discover that all you have recieved is a box full of parts.You will be the proud owner of 31 plastic parts hat come with 25 screws for assembly.I am a mechanic and don't mind putting things together but other shoppers might be displeased."
412280,1,"I've only used it once so far, but I'm very pleased with the purchase. Overnight temperatures dipped just below freezing on my trip. I had a good sleeping bag and bundled up. The tent kept out the cold just enough. I think for temperatures any lower, I'll look for a more specialized tent. This one will certainly work for 3 seasons though. Can't wait to bring it out again."
279904,0,"The rating isn't ment to degrade the product. They are very needed when using the inline skates, just don't have the WOW factor"
501336,1,You might not think there is much room for improvement in the world of fishing bobbers but the Rocket Bobber will change that. It is really a great product that makes a difference in your fishing. A dramatic improvement in casting with the ability to target a spot and hit greater distances than what I have seen with any other product. I gave some away as gifts and everyone has loved them.

134853,1,Worked perfectly on the equipment that I have. Install a water bottle cover on my backpack and only took a few minutes to do it.
341538,0,"It's a great size to fit some credit cards and maybe some cash. You can't get a chap stick in this container. If you were looking to hold a little more, you should go the size up. The color is nice but the case itself felt a little cheap compared to others I bought in the past."
233791,1,"i was a little unsure of choosing this glove, as i was worried the material may be too thin or too hot on the hands, since i live in southern california. this product arrived on time and in good condition. When first putting them on they were a little scratchy but feel fine after washing them. i have been using these gloves for about a week for work and they have done a great job of keeping my hands comfortably warm and blister free."

Blade seems slightly bent/curved from shipping.Product is good quality, though blade is surprisingly dull. Just above a butter knife. Needs professional sharpening. Very disappointed.Considering a return."
271727,1,awesome. perfect. arrived in perfect time and is EXACTLY how it is in the picture. perfect color. perfect EVERYTHING!!!!! I AM VERY SATISFIED!!!!!!!!!!!!
324545,1,This little grill fired up right out the box. Easy assembly. Uses a small gas canister-$2.95 at Home Depot. Have cooked three meals with first gas can with some left over. Ideal for small spaces and e-z to move and store. You don't have go camping to use this-enough room for a meal for 4.
344726,0,"I like everything about these pants except for the belt. Most football pants have the belt go all the way around the pants so you can adjust the waist easy, but these ones are stitched on. I had to end of fixing the stitch so my son could even wear them, or else they would keep falling off. Good quality material, but I do not thing I would ever purchase them again because of the belt issue."
182005,1,My son loved this as they fit well and can be used for any kind of activity. Great brand and a good price too.
328280,2,"I have purchased Under Armor products in the past and enjoyed them. However, I was completely dissatisfied with this product. The only thing I like about it is the length of the capri pants. The waist line is too short, and the fabric is flemsy and not what I expected. I would have returned the product, but unfortunately, I threw the receipt and packaging away before I had an opportunity to try the product on. $31.00 plus dollars wasted!"
397905,0,"At first I was pleased with the foot pod, it is very light and easy to run with. However, when running on a track, I tried to calibrate the unit to a precise 1.0 mile. The setting wouldn't save properly and kept changing to either 1.1 or 0.9 and didn't seem to have systematic reason why. To be safe on my pacing, I set the unit to 0.9 and trained with it for 5-10 miles run satisfactorily for a few weeks.During a marathon, I tried to keep my pace based on the footpod reading. After mile 10 I realized the footpod wasn't accurately hitting the mile markers. After running the 26.2, the footpod indicated that I ran well over 28 miles. My race results indicated that I ran at a perfectly even pace, despite the fact that, according to the footpod, I increased my pace a half minute per mile over the last six miles. It turned out that the calibration unit was set to 1.0526, a value that I certainly never entered.The bottom line is the calibration function on the unit I have is flaky. I'm going to see if I can get it replaced."
314516,1,"Ordered this product for my niece. Opened it and looks like it is made from good, durable material. Will be happy to order in the future if needed."
51030,1,"I just picked up these goggles for a recent ski trip, and I have to say, I was more than impressed. They offer great UV protection, and do not fog up whatsoever. They're comfortable, and seem to be built very durably. The lenses fared well even on a very sunny day, leading me to recommend them as a solid choice for all around skiing/boarding conditions. At this price, I think these are a terrific bet."
283247,0,I received the 1500 lb winch but it was not the one shown in the picture. I was offered to send it back but there was no word if they had the proper one so I am going to keep the one sent. I am disappointed.Steve.
341341,0,This forearm device is a bit too thin to offer much protection for sparring and blocking. It has a snug fit and if all you need is a little protection then this is a good choice. It does cause sweating.
129621,1,For the DIYer this is a great buy. Quality wire for a reasonable price. Great for auto and boat projects. Get a repair manual and spool of wire and save big bucks.

224606,0,My husband isn't exactly small. He always wears a large in pants. These are about two inches too long so be really can't wear them to the gym. As far as I'm concerned they were too expensive to be just lounge pants.
150209,1,These weights are a great value for the money. My only complaint is that they get slippery toward the end of my workout. I'm constantly wiping my hands in the middle between sets. Gloves might be the answer to my problem but wanted to share it anyway.
335233,2,"The exercises are easy and you may be a little soar. However, anyone with a tight schedule will be unable to do the hour pluse that it takes to complete the workout. The DVD only shows the right side moves and you will definantly have to work and practice the moves before you are able to fit them in your routine. The dance/cardio part is hard to follow as she does not give any direction to what is next. tried to follow but just made my own routine with her moves to the count of 8. Now, if you have a chef come cook for you, it's no problem; but if you are on a budget (like me) you cannot find most of the products the recipe calls for; preptime; and servings are unrealistic. I was still hungary and just, resumed my Weight Watchers diet, easy and no fuss. Also my family was able to enjoy the same meal and I only had to cook dinner once. Inches lost NONE, Weight lost 5 lbs. and this was on a 30 day tryout."
65787,0,"Delivery of our bowl was quick, which was great, but the performance of our bowl..not so. It leaked when flipped on its side even though we followed the directions exactly and never filled over the line. We do know other people who have and swear by this bowl, so maybe ours was just defective. Also, we thought that we were getting a black bowl like the one pictured, but ended up getting a grey bowl instead. The customer service people were helpful, fast and efficient and we would do business with them again."
432969,0,"I used these sticks for P.E. in school, and it was really hard to learn how to cradle (keep the ball in the pocket by turning the stick), catching, and throwing. The ball kept popping out! It was also hard to play games with them, because whenever someone finally made a good throw, chances are that no one is going to catch it. The sticks give you no training on how you use a real stick. I tried to use a real stick with a woven net once, and it was hard to cradle because I was used to such tall sides. On the plus side, it was good having two different colors of sticks so you could tell who's on which team. All in all, these sticks are great for P.E. classes and teachers, but not so great for people who want to play the sport in organized play or those that are just learning."
207608,1,"This is the only model of compact water filter I could find that doesn't require frequent filter changes. A little steep in price, but that concern goes out the window when you need clean water."
210258,0,"Bought this for my Springfield XD-40 Subcompact that has a 3"" barrel. Doesn't fit. Uncle Mikes chart says this is for 3""-3 1/2"" sub compact autos. The trigger guard catches at the seam, doesn't go inside. Not safe at all. Considering returning or keeping it for a possible future smaller gun."
32774,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
106237,1,"I bought this over five years ago and it's been a great companion of mine ever since. I've used nearly every tool on it, and everything on there does a good job at what it's for. Torquing the screwdriver has never strained or bent the tool, the blades have remained sharp, the scissors' still function like new, and even the hook can support more weight than you'd think. The only negatives are that it has four tools that actually leave the knife itself, and I've lost two of them. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's interested in a swiss army knife - it's got a wide enough variety of tools that anyone can find a use for it at some point."
401516,0,"Completely satisfied with the shorts. That said, they came with, for lack of a better word, a scuff mark on the back right side. As if they were worn and the wearer slid on cement or something. Not a big deal to me, but still curious."
264314,1,"I purchased these for use around the house. They're as comfortable as pj's, yet nice enough to wear out.They wash well, I didn't notice any shrinking or fading. They also where wrinkle-free when I took them out of the dryer immediately. The only think I'd change on them would be to add pockets, those would be a big plus."
128749,0,"It's a good tripod for holding a football for field goal kicking, although I wish the length from the football to the base of the tripod was a little longer, but not that big of a deal.

385189,2,"I have had the Thermos Nissan 16-ounce stainless backpack bottle for three months now.Pros: keeps my coffee warm; does not alter the taste of the coffee; is attractive; sipping mechanism works nicely; the one-piece flip-up lid is well designed for drinking and is more convenient than the traditional two piece with the cup.Cons: it leaks! (into bag, onto carpet, down my arm, on my clothes); after drinking without any noticeable leakage, liquid secretly escapes and drips down the side and forms a ring on the bottom; does not keep coffee as warm as my other Thermos Nissan 16-Ounce Stainless-Steel Insulated Bottle.Honestly I don't know why I have kept this so long with all the leaks!Maybe because I found ways to reduce the leaking, such as if I filled it well below the full line, but even then it leaked a small amount onto my friend's carpet - I see that stain every time I visit him.I also thought if I screwed the lid on first and then closed the top it did not leak, which helps, but then it was put on it's side and leaked in the tote bag all over the groceries. What kind of a back pack bottle is this?I think I just can't bare the waste of throwing it away."
284335,2,"I decided to purchase this item because I was looking for an inexpensive pump that came with a sports ball inflation needle. This item was described as ""Sport ball inflation needle stored in handle for easy access."" However, the item did not match the description. What I received was a ""Bell Airstrike Bike Pump"" (it didn't have ""1800"" on it) and it did not come with the sports ball inflation needle in the handle. I returned the item to Amazon."

The only thing that wasnt decent was the scope it wasnt even magnafide,everything else was great.It shot very far and accurate.What was very great about it was that it took less than 30 seconds to load all the 50 bullets.Last it had very great detail."
375422,1,"It took about 45 minutes to assemble and I was on the road. Not only does it look good (no funky colors or stickers) the seat is soooo comfortable. The price was right, too."
195576,1,"pros - the product works great.the carrying case is very nice.you can put a razor edge on anything with these.cons - they are ceramic.there is a learning curve to getting the most out of these.summary -this is all i use now to sharpen all my knives, axes, shears and whatever. i even use this to hone my lawnmower blade (after using a bastard file to take out the nicks). the instructions that come with the files is crap; use the files like they are files, or lay them on a flat surface and use them as a bench stone. i don't use the fine grit very often (i think it was kind of a waste), it is just toooooooooooooooooooooo fine. the medium file will do anything you need it too - save yourself some money and just by the medium stone if you can... unless you are sharpening a straight blade to shave with, the fine (white file) is an over kill.i have been using hoppe's no. 9 to clean my files when they get ""fouled"". i am not sure if i am killing my files with hoppe's no. 9, but if i am i will happily buy more."
442719,1,"PROS:1) If you wear glasses, you will appreciate the eye-relief of this monocular. You get the full view without having to remove your eye-wear or even touch the monocular to your lenses (helps avoid smudging your eye-wear).2) Bright image. In this regard, this scope is far superior to those tiny common ""pocket"" monoculars. With this scope, details are preserved, even in low light conditions.3) Wide field of view, with a crisp image, even towards the outer edges.4) Easy to hold. As others have commented, this monocular isn't compact. On the plus side, it makes it easier to hold. With many of the smaller monoculars and binoculars, a person tends to grip with finger tips. With this scope, you pretty much hold it like a drinking glass: The palm of your hand wraps around it comfortably and securely.5) The close focus feature (as close as 18 inches) can be useful...and focusing is relatively easy.If you're looking for something compact enough to put in your shirt pocket, this is NOT it. It's about the size of a 6-ounce juice glass. That's really the only trade-off."

I can't believe what I read about this mat being good with Bikram or ashtanga yoga, that is baloney. It may last a life time but I'd rather buy 3 mats for the price of this one mat and not slip everytime it gets a little moisture on it....Pretty disappointed for the money I paid. Absolutely would not buy again....."

292550,0,"This water bottle is well made with quality materials, but I can't get past the annoying, high-pitched gurgling sound that the air valve makes when drinking from it. I have the 40 oz. model and take it to work with me every day. Anyone within about a 100 ft radius can hear the obnoxiously loud gurgling noise--it's actually quite disruptive. People look around, wondering where the heck the noise is coming from. The spectacle was humorous at first, but eventually drinking becomes annoying and embarrassing. Having to hold a finger over the valve with one hand to dampen the sound and gripping the bottle with the other hand makes for a cumbersome and awkward drinking routine. If I was not in an office environment, the noise would not bother me."

355009,1,"I got this for my four year old this Christmas. It came mostly assembled and what I needed to assemble was very easy to do (maybe 10-15 minutes). I like this bike more than my older daughter's first bike as it seems to be a bit more durable from a construction standpoint. Also, having a quick release on the seat post makes it easy to adjust the seat height - something I'm sure we'll do a lot as she grows and when we take off the training wheels. It's only been a couple of days but - so far so good."
477044,0,had this for a month now and it is not bad but it does make sounds every once in a while. If it lasts for a couple of years it will be worth the cost.

This device is essentially identical to the one the trainers use at the health club and works just as it should. I am very happy with its performance. Here are some specifics:Pros* Sturdy construction.* Strong, heavily stitched loop joints.* Multiple loops for various applications.* Helpful and informative instruction manual.Cons* End loops could be a little bigger to accommodate larger foot/shoe sizes.Comments* This product does what it is supposed to do.* The only recommendation I have for improvement would be larger end loops.* Overall, this is an excellent product (four-star) product. I strongly recommend it."

I too had a problem with sports top on it being hard to open.Don't try using your teeth or you'll be heading to the Dentist office for repairs..I didn't waste my time shipping it back because Amazon's policy seems to be that theymay charge up to $3.95 for shipping of returns so I didn't see the point.
356621,1,I bought this cot to use at a women's retreat I go to a few times a year. Ended up using it almost all of last month in my kids room due to out of town guests. My kids didn't complain at all. When I finally got around to using it I found it easy to set up and take apart and about as comfortable as I expected it to be. My 6 foot plus husband slept on it one night and his feet didn't hang off the edge. It folds up very compactly and is convenient to store. Overall very happy with this purchase.
400381,0,"If you're looking a for good heavy-weight T-shirt for the gym or the just to wear around, I prefer the 6.1 oz. over this 5.5 oz. shirt. Go the heavier route, you'll be glad you did!"

I've tried several recommended tricks for fixing the *numerous* game-ending bugs in this game, but none have worked. If you have any doubts, check some of the online forums, such as EA's support forum, and see for yourself. This game has no game."
157366,0,"Because I'm a man, I can appreciate the ""freedom"" this seat offers my man-parts while riding. And because I'm a thin man, I double appreciate the wide cushion shape not digging into my posterior. Unfortunately, I find myself struggling not to slip forward right off the seat. And that's no good either. So I'm still on the hunt for the perfect bicycle seat... One that cushions my behind, doesn't squish my man-parts, and holds me in place while riding.Pros: Very comfortable on the behind. No pressure on the family jewels.Cons: As slippery as a slip 'n slide, even when using it on my stationary bike."
33489,1,"This lantern is very bright and the solar panels really work to charge well. We have taken this camping with us only one time so far and we got enough sunlight during the day to completely charge the lantern for the next night. It also is very bright and puts off enough light. In fact, we like it so much that we have bought two more- another for us and one for a friend. It is wonderful not to have to carry any type of fuel or batteries when you go camping and that alone makes up for the price difference between this lantern and less expensive propane, kerosene or battery lanterns. Plus, you get the added benefit of helping the environment.The only thing I cannot speak about is the long-term quality of the lanterns. We have only had ours for one month so I do not know how much rough treatment the solar panels will take."
327846,1,"This product was what I expected. They're a little light/thin, so I wouldn't recommend them for yard work, but they're great for running and playing basketball."
312584,1,"This is our new favorite tent! It really stood the test of the mountain this last weekend on our backpacking trip. Looked into a lot of tents and this one seemed the best for my husband and I for our mountain extravaganzas. We got to base camp at about 8pm when the sun was going down, but no worries! Cuz this tent was the easiest and simplest to set up I've ever experienced. There was a perfect amount of room for both of us, plus our packs. It was really great to be able to get out on our own side whenever we needed to. The test I refer to is that on the next night, a great thunderstorm set in and we weathered at least 30 mph winds and pouring rain so fierce we thought it could collapse the fly any second, but it all held together solidly and we didn't get a bit wet at all! Needless to say, we're very impressed and are happy with our tent!"
467594,1,This was bought for my 2 yr old grandson. He has had a blast with it. Just the right size.

369553,0,"This product worked as expected and can restore my knives angle. But, the stone won't last long. After 5 knives, the stones wear off quicker than I expected. It may be gone after 15 knives. If so, this will become a very expansive tool. The cost for the stone set is more than $30."
466347,1,I bought these socks to help stabilize my feet. I've been using toe relaxers but needed something extra. I wear these with my dress shoes at the office. They are warm enough without being too warm. They fit perfectly and look like dress socks. Love them and plan to order more.
457600,0,"Good concept and seems comfortable. Comes fairly compact, but still has some size and weight you should consider. Never could deflate it to its original state.

154951,2,DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE!!!! IT has been falsely advertised. It does not hold 70 rds like it say but really holds only 30. It is the exact same magazine that comes with the High Power Steyr. I bought two of these thinking they were 70 rounds and got them today I feel completly ripped off.

353152,1,"Just completed my first 15 mile ride with this thing. Although not as light weight as some other helmets I have tried, this helmet is light enough to forget you're even wearing it. It has awesome ventilation (yay, no more sweat dripping into my eyes while I'm riding!) and it fits my head just perfectly. I wasn't sure if I should get the Medium or Large because my head tends to be a little on the larger side, but this medium turned out to be perfect. The adjusting mechanism is perfect and makes for a nice tight fit, with even pressure all around without any noticeable pressure points. It seems to confirm to your head just nicely, instead of your head having to conform to it, like the $10 Target special that this replaced!Looks very nice as well."
314561,0,when this first arrives it is to stiff to move in but after washing it a few times it gets better and it dose not hold up verry well but for the price it was worth it.

If you really want something that lasts, look for another product."

190433,2,"I got these (Blue, Large, from another source) just before a dive trip to Bonaire since they are lighter for traveling. After a week, the colored plastic part developed white stress marks and bent and twisted permanently. They did work well for finning, but weren't worth bringing home so I threw them in the trash. Another thing. I wear a size 10 1/2 but these large were flopping around so had to wear neoprene dive socks. Smaller size, too tight."
264426,0,"This compass is built very well and required no adjustment or calibration as received. My only gripe is that the black dial is hard to read unless it is in full sunlight. The built in light helps, but does not fully solve the problem. I suggest buying a unit with a white, or other light colored, dial. I would have given it 5 stars had the unit been easier to read."
433277,0,"It's a good bag, but it does have some issues, mainly due to its capacity. It really doesn't hold a whole lot. I use it while riding my motorcycle, and I usually have a 'planner' style folder that I use to carry all the bikes paperwork and what-not, and even that takes up a fair amount of space. I try to carry the clear lens to my helmet in the big pocket so that if it gets dark while I'm out I can take of my tinted lens, but the lens itself prevents me from having anything else in the most useful pocket. The front pocket cant carry much of all. Also, it isn't a huge deal, but the top strap that's used to hang the bag up when not in use, broke without much of a fight. The strap had barely been used, and it broke with almost no weight on it, so that isn't much of a good thing.I do like the cup holder on the side, fits a 20oz bottle quite easily, and I don't have to worry about it falling out at 70+ mph. And even though it does have some flaws, the backpack really isn't too expensive, fractions of the price of many other bags out there. It does it's job, though just barely, and is a good looking pack. For the money, not a bad purchase, but I am sure there are better options out there for a motorcycle rider."

140540,1,"For EA's first time out of the box with a fitness game this is excellent. I was a little apprehensive when I first saw EA was putting this out because while Wii Fit is pretty fun I don't feel that it really helps you get in shape or strenghtens. But after reading mostly positive reviews from critics and users I decided to give it a try. Must say I was really surprised the first time I used it how sweaty and weak kneed I was. Since I play tennis or run, sometimes both the same day, at least every other day I felt my lower body was in pretty good shape. But after the second day my legs were so sore I had trouble getting up and down the steps to my apartment. I see some reviewers complaining about the movements not being recognized even when you feel you're doing them correctly. I did have some trouble the first time I used it but now on my 4th day of workouts I've pretty much got the controls and movements down. It just takes a little getting used to and making sure you use the correct technique. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the resistance band that comes with it is really bad. No matter how much I fold it over I still can't feel anything when doing the upper body work. Best to go buy some decent bands at the sports store. Also there is virtually no core excercises. I do see that EA is already working on an expansion pack for later this year that will incorporate core work. All in all a pretty solid workout that just needs a few tweaks to perfect."
46668,0,It did what I needed it to do...Keep my bike safe for a 500mile drive. I kept it on the outside bike holder and had no problems with it striking the car. It was relatively easy to put together. My only complaint is the bottom strap made a small black mark on the bottom of the my bumper.
98548,0,The quality is not as good as previous ones I have bought. The others were thicker and heavier cloth. These were made in Pakistan but don't remember where my original ones were made.
290674,0,I installed grips on a brand new Taurus M85 revolver. On the l/h side of the Taurus M85 frame has a hole where (I think it is where the hammeer spring and hammer attatches) and the grips just bearly covers that hole. I can take a small flashlight and shine it there using a magnifying glass (old eyes) and am not very happy with the fit. Generally the Hogue grips feel better than the little Taurus grips that comes on the revolver. Getting ready to install a laser and I want to see if that will affect the fit and function of these grips. I have used Hogue grips for over 30 years without any problems. I am not sure I can recommend these particular grips to anyone at this time. No problems with the supplier.
245095,1,"Probably the 5th pair I've bought over the past 10 years. Its the 5th, only because I've either lost or neglected my previous ones. The rubber will wear, but that the same with anything. For the price, and more so the quality and performance, I have no complaints."

But i was wrong. It's ok.

279202,0,"My fiance and I went on a road trip with this air mattress, and were impressed the first night as we went to bed. About 4 hours later I awoke with a cramp in my arm and I was holding on to the edge of the mattress for dear life, so I wouldn't roll into my fiance. I turned over to see how my fiance was doing, and he also was holding onto the edge like a life preserver.I will say the one pro is the inflation process. It took minutes, and if we mustered the energy four hours into our sleep we just turned it on, and it would inflate with us on it.I guess thats what happens when you don't spend the extra money on a Aero bed. We've both slept on those before, and they were awesome.Overall, for the money it was good, but don't plan on having perfect sleep unless your a teenager."
476517,0,"I've had this pump for several years now and it can never inflate the mattress to a comfortable firmness. Even after 10 minutes on fresh batteries your bum will hit the ground when lie down. So, you'll still need a manual or just get a more powerful pump.Given the weakness, its still beats having the inflate the mattress with the manual pump. So 5 minutes with this pump and a minute with the manual pump is enough to get the right firmness."
235533,0,"The one positive feature of this hostler is that once the firearm is holstered it holds it secure from falling out. You can adjust it so that the firearm rattles in it and yet won't fallout.the negative feature is that is a hard plastic that takes a lot of playing with to adjust to you pistol. I even put an object in the holster and set it in the sun,....voila...by nightfall it was perfect. Next day I holstered my pistol which went in easily and my nightfall I could not get that pistol out without taking the holster off and using a screw driver to pry it loose. If and that's a big IF, they had adjusting screws they would have a winner. But alas there are no adjustments. So I bought a Galco leather holster with adjust adjustment screws and it works fine."

158697,1,"My grandson gave me a gift card from Amazon.com for my Birthday.I went on line and ordered a golf glove and a pair of golf sandles. I had no problem making the order,but at the end a note came up saying that some times the order would be split. Didn't think much about it until I did the final processing. I had been charged a shipping of $7.98 on the golf glove that I gave $10.95 for ,which ended up costing me$18.93 for the glove.Then they charged another $6.99 on the shipping of the golf sandles,which were on sale for $ 29.99 (which was a great price).So, I ended up and had to pay $15.91 for shipping. I WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE SHIPPING CHARGE.I had orded my grandson a pair of shoes for Christmas from Amazon and they had free shipping. I guess that was what I thought I would get this time."

94804,0,"This band is not the same high quality material that came with my Seiko H558-5008 (yes, the well-known ""Arnold"" dive watch, so-called because Schwarzenegger wore one in several of his early films), but then what is the same quality as it was twenty-four years ago? Not much. This is the same style and size, and went on easily with the supplied replacement pins using a proper band pin removal tool. (Sorry, a small screwdriver doesn't work as well. If you want to change your own band, spring for the hinge pin tool.) For the price, I'm satisfied. If I wanted fancier, I'd get fancier. (Yes, I've had a Hirsch sharkskin band on this watch. But for snorkeling, you want rubber.)As with most diving equipment, have the seals on your watch checked/replaced regularly."

I understood Juniors to mean teenage girl age. As a 20 year old girl, I can easily wear a M/L in these shorts for Juniors/adults. When I got my package, I received a Youth Large instead. I had to give the shorts to someone else who could wear them because I needed them on a time crunch. This is a good brand, just a little confusing on the description."

Can't wait to get it out in the field and put some real ""mileage"" on it. ---->>June 13,2011 -- have now used this cot on two occasions, once with a twin bed blow-up mattress, which fits well on the cot, and once with a inflatable pad. Both times were a good night sleep. When using the pad, it was a little difficult getting over the edge to get up and out of the cot. But it slept well and had plenty of room. Still needs to have a better rubber foot for the legs -- originals went on first try, and thanks for a new set, however, they did not fare much better. Am going to try a pvc pipe end cap inside of cut open tennis balls -- will let you know how it goes after next trip. Still like the cot and its strength -- for those interested in this unit -- the only severe drawback > since it is for ""big boys"" and has a larger frame, don't plan on backpacking this thing - its 42"" length, folded, & weight put it in a car trip, close to use point, category."
409433,2,"I got this vest from my wife as a gift, so I shouldn't be looking a gift horse in the mouth. Maybe that's OK, as my comments are not directed at her, but to possible future buyers.I've had other vests, so I've had time to develop a very strong opinion about features that I like and don't. This vest doesn't meet up with some of the basics that I am used to enjoying with my years old Gap vest.First of all, the fleece is quite thin and porous and thus not warm in a breeze, so I don't wear it outside much. The large arm holes don't help there either.The zipper is only one way, i.e., it doesn't open up from the bottom. To me that is a major inconvenience as I can't adjust the bottom when I am sitting or driving. With the slightly longer cut, the vest ends up bunching up around my waist. I also have to undo the zipper completely or yank the bottom of the vest halfway up my waist if I have to pull down the zipper in my pants to go to the bathroom.My major problem, however, is with the cut. The middle has a lot of fabric and won't lay flat over my chest and stomach. It finally occurred to me that it is actually perfect for someone with a medium pot belly, but that's not me.My final complaint is with the pocket zipper, they go down to close. If you don't zip it fully, small things like change or keys, will fall out.Overall, the design feels like there was a lack of thought throughout. Maybe they turned a junior designer loose on this item.Since I won;t be returning the vest, it'll get demoted to workshop duty."
449017,0,"For the money this is a pretty good bike. The dificulty in putting it together was a 4, things were bent and had to be corrected. Once all together, the bike had problems moving another bent part that had to be fixed. It still makes a clicking noise when being peddled from the gear area. I guess you get what you paid for. My daugher only uses this bike when here on weekends, so it is OK for that. I would not buy this if this is a daily use bike. My mom always said, "" you get what you pay for"" This statement would apply to this bike."
186996,0,"I bought one of these knives as a White Elephant gift and was impressed enough to order one myself. However, I used a different vendor.This knife came individually packaged inside a larger Amazon box with other items but it looked slightly used. There were scratches on the sides of it, finish was dull, the toothpick was bent in 2 places, and the tweezers were bent. The tweezer tip also is a little recessed which seems like it was worn down over time or a factory defect.This is just going in an an emergency bag so if I use it once and the outcome is positive then it did its job.I've had actual Swiss army knives before and this one has similar features but not the same overall quality or thickness of the metal. The knife has a lifetime warranty but also warns bending components could break them. I suspect that this knife will last longer if used lightly and infrequently as is my intent."

14567,0,"it could be better. I had this pedal for about 2 days but I sent it back because I felt that it didn't offer enough in terms of settings (especially for a digitech pedal). Give it a try, if you like it keep it. I personally decided to go with the Digitech Metal Master because it has a lot more to offer in terms of tonal variation.Pros:Good construction for the price.Pretty sweet graphics.Good place to start a search for your tone.Cons:Digitech is lazy (they usually use the same hardware in every pedal with a different program running on the chip)For a Digitech pedal the tonal selection is pretty limited."
176593,1,"It was a little difficult to figure out the sizing when ordering, but I guessed correctly. These are made from a very comfy cotton/poly blend, and are color-accurate. The cut is a little strange--very high in the waist, not a lot of space in the groin--but they're still fine despite it. The unwrapped waistband might not be comfortable with extended wear, but I've had no problem with it yet."

341719,0,"I haven't learned a sword form before, so bought this to practice. Before I bought one, I tried out one at a local martial arts store, but judging by the picture this one looked better than the other type of wooden sword. A few things that I wanted to know before buying this one was the length of the ""blade"" and the balance point. The blade is 29 inches long and the balance point is 7 inches from the guard (1/4 of the length).Some bad points about the sword I received (don't know if they are alike). The guard wiggles, so I plan to glue it. The blade is apparently attached to the hilt with a wooden pin/post (and glue) which sticks out a little, so I plan to file that down. Given these points, I still think it's better than the other one."

The release button is a great touch and the lock made it secure and still functional with a flip with your finger.Perfect for traveling."

60865,1,"Hornady was one of the only companies that I could find that still produces a .218 bee shell holder. Having picked up a classic marlin lever action in .218, it only made sense to reload my own ammunition for it. This shell holder is a typical Hornady product: top quality, simple, and affordable. I used it in my RCBS rock chucker single state reloading press. The fit between the press and the shell holder was very tight, but not so much that I couldn't install and remove it. Given the chance, I will usually buy Hornady products over others, and I would recommend that to anyone else looking at reloading supplies."
117354,0,"The seat doesn't stay secure on the stinger. It wobbles a lot when there is no baby. When the baby is in the seat, it might feel less wobbly, but it tilts to one side. When you make a turn, baby will swing from one side to the other side. I constantly worry that I will lose my balance as I ride.Safety belt too flimsy for the price. It might be ok for a little bouncer, but not for a bike seat. It's very hard to adjust, made of low end material, and doesn't really secure in case of an accident. 3 point harness is a joke for bike seat. Even strollers have 5 point harness nowadays.On the other hand, it's fun to ride with the baby when he can enjoy the view."

18945,2,"Nice design, nice idea, but... in this day of conscientious health research (and Nalgene!) why would a company supply athletic, health-conscious people with a container that offgases plastic stank into the water? (You should know, this problem is noted in complaints and home remedies all over the web). I'm out doing something healthy and you want me to drink plastic fumes? See any problem with this picture? This is an abdication of common sense & duty. Why make it your customers responsibility to address such a fundamental, nasty problem? If Camlebak feels this is a legitimate burden to pass on, why not acknolwedge the problem front and center on all your maketing materials? ""Now with nastier tasting water!!"" See how well that sells; because I consider it negligent, or at least bargaining in bad faith. It even says on the label ""taste free liner, (and delivery tube).""This is called lying.The entire point of this product is to drink more frequently. The result of their dumb material choice is that you can't bear to take another drink of this crappy water, and you hydrate less than you should. Camelbak should be nominated for a Darwin award.Beyond that, the orchestration of product and information is extremely poor. You can overcome the off-gassing (some say) with a solution found on the web, but why isn't it on the damn label? Hand-cleaning it is not as easy as one would hope. The label refers you to cleaning tablets that aren't included and can't be found. ... and a cleaning brush that it doesn't come with. How do you get into the tube to clean it? It comes with a few too many design gee-gaws and too few explanations; it makes you bewildered. Why does the flap blow up in the wind and hit me in the head? Why is there an eyelet on the flap, and what (!) does it secure to? How does the tube most usefully go through the two loops provided? Instead they cover other trivialities in 5 different languages on the label. You know, I don't really care that I can drive over the water-bladder, if I can't bear another sip of that atrocious water. dumb.This is basic stuff camelbak! Get a clue. Go back to the drawing board. Do your job!!!"
209008,2,"This product arrived packed professionaly and in a very timely manner.The product itself is not at all worth the money. Creel lid does not open properly and the handle on the back broke off the first time I tried to raise it. The lid is so bad that I have decided to remove it entirely and replace the cheap construction with leather that I had to go purchase.Though this item was not going to be used as it was intended, which I am glad because it wouldn't have made it through one fishing trip I am sure, it still should have been of some quality."
137321,0,"Under product features it states ""100% Cotton"" they are actually 58% polyester/42% cotton (at least the 2 I received which were Large colors-Graphite and Oxford). They will breathe, only because they are VERY lightweight. Very thin cotton that I do not expect to last more than a few washings. I would have been better off getting basic Hanes color T's at Walmart for $3.99 each.UPDATE 12/4/2009 - 3 years old now and they have held up fine. After researching the Russell Athletic website the gray tones are a poly mixture, the other colors are 100% cotton. If you are looking for the old-school heavy duty quality search for ""Russell Athletic PERFORMANCE"", these are the T's I grew up with and last for decades, but I'm overall happy with the basic line."
499444,0,"I have had this product for 2 months now. And this is my take on it as of now...1. The description says ""six pace-based workouts"". Despite reading reviews that said this is not true, I got it to test the truth myself:-) Well, there are NO ""pace-based workouts"". Did not want the trouble of dismantling and returning, so I am using it. But beware when buying - you will not get any inbuilt programs.2. Assembly was fairly simple, but a team of two is advised to assemble. And tighten the bolts!3. There is a bit of a squishy noise from the paddle arrangement. Maybe greasing would help, but have not tried for fear of spoiling the carpet.4. A little unstable - wobbles at times. I remember reading some mention of gym mats, but have not tried it.5. Stride is short, so tall people - think twice.Looks like I am griping, but actually it is an OK piece for the price.As for the durability, I will come back in 6-8 months and tell you how it goes."

67780,0,"The Blade itself is sharp and does a great job at blazing a trail. The Sheath on the other hand is just a piece of nylon. This is great if the tip was blunted but the tip is pointy, like really pointy, and cuts through the front of the sheath. I had to get a blacksmith friend to put a metal tip on the front of my nylon sheath and even though he is a friend, it wasn't cheap to get that done."
453261,1,"As other reviewers point out, this step is smaller than the ones in gyms but I didn't have any problem with it's size. In fact, it's nice because it's easier to store in my closet. However, the workout video included is annoying. She goes through the moves too quickly and doesn't warn you when a new move is coming up. Some of the moves tell you to spin around so your back is to the tv and you have to turn strangely to see her and try to keep up. I'm definitely keeping the step but I will probably find a different video."
41066,1,This product was recommended to me by another RV'er and it works perfectly for my purposes with a bank of four 12v. batteries.

My only complaint is that it could be a little more focused so you can see the road in front of you better."

179108,1,"I am reviewing this product because I've owned these grips for over 30 years. I have transferred them from one pistol to another seven or eight times.The rubber material used wears like iron. Unless I told you the age, you can't tell my grips are 30 years old. There is virtually no wear on them at all. They have a connecting piece that holds the two sides together across the front strap of the frame, which is checkered, so you don't have to spend a big chunk of cash on having the frame checkered by a gunsmith. Though hard to find, you can get a flat mainspring housing with the same Pachmayr checkered rubber covering that gives you complete surround for superb control and non-slip surface.Each panel has a thumb swell just above the top panel screw, giving your thumb a natural place to rest, and which helps center your hand on the grip. The rubber is just flexible enough that it helps absorb recoil while preventing the gun from moving in your hand even with heavy +P loads.I love my Pachmayr Presentation grips, and will never own a 1911 without them. If you want a pretty grip with fancy wood and such, these are not for you. But, if you value superb design, superb quality, and life long utility these are the way to go."

Also the free shipping only took 3 business days from when we ordered it."
278121,0,"Well, I got this gun, and a set of pistols yesterday, and at first I let the battery charge for 12 hours, like it said, and used the pistols. Then, today, I used the gun. Once I loaded up the banna clip (20 rounds) I stuck into the mag slot, and let fire. First on semi auto, and got a little feel for the gun. Then, I put another 20 in, tried out full auto, and aimed at my target, (about 12 feet away) and unleashed all 20 rounds. It emptied in about 2 seconds....but I hit my target 13 out of 20 shots! Then, since that emptied VERY fast, I tried out my Hi Cap Mag. (Hodls about 110 rounds). I only put maybe, 30 in there, and spun the wheel to get them ready. Fired ok...But I have one jammed in there, so Im out a Hi-Cap mag untill I get it fixed, (Note: I didnt use that to affect my review, because it DOES shoot good!)It comes with a flash hider (useless, no flash. =P) a silencer, (once again, does nothing...all noise is from gear box inside the gun...)some shooting glasses, and a red dot site. (Seriously, dont even use the red dot site, it is WAY off, your ironsights are better....)and a sling. I ended up just using the flash hider, as I think it looks better than with no attachent on the gun, but still keeps it relatively compact.The hop up is pretty good, (you can adjust it alot to fit your needs/range/preference) and once you get it adjusted it shoots pretty much dead straight,and far! Also, I dont know how much it hurts, I havent used it in a battle yet, but it shoots harder than my pistols (about 90 FPS faster) and my pistols only sting.So I gave it 3 of 5 stars. Its a pretty good gun (not that I can say much, Ive only shot this, my friend's Mini and Shotgun, and my 8 dollar pistol) but this is probably the best Ive shot, and for this price, why not?PS- Does anyone have any idea on how to fix my Hi-Cap mag? The little BB is jammed on that hole where it goes into the guns chamber and wont come out. >.&lt;So overall I gave it 3 out of 5 stars."
445615,0,"I was a bit hesitant on buying this since it has no sizing info. So I went straight to Oakley's website and it says there that the small vault could fit mostly for whisker, fives, fives squared, etc. So I went on to buying it. When I received it the shipping was fast and it came a day ahead (and I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because of that) BUT, the thing is, it's really small. I don't think it would fit the fives or whisker's. I own a squared whisker and it does fit in but it fits really tight to the point that I'm concerned that the sunglasses might get bent or out of shape in time. I think this small vault would best fit their small prescription glasses instead of what has been said. Food for thought."
190760,2,"What a piece of crap. The adjustable head has so much slack that the scope, camera or whatever you put on it wobbles from side to side. It has so much slack that it won't even hold your accessory straight. I sent mine back for a refund. Don't waste your money."

Awesome feature that it has is that you can click it onto other magazines to make it a dual mag, triple mag etc. Good for a Double Eagle product."
101567,0,I purchased this for wearing at the Y during swim exercise class. This is a light exercise class so there is no underwater or lap swim. I have long hair and it is difficult to stretch this and pull over the hair. It works best when I have stretched the cap over a bowl prior to use. It keeps my hair dry if I have properly fitted cap on but it seems to stay tighter towards the forehead and as a result gives a slight headache during usage. I continue to look for the perfect cap.
411290,0,"I ordered this bar, from this page (""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com""), but was instead sent a different chin-up bar, sold by a third party, but fulfilled by Amazon. It was the ""Sunny"" brand, sold by Triple Play.I'm not sure about the difference in quality, but one of the reasons I ordered THIS bar was the brackets. It appears (not sure if it's true) that you can easily remove the bar when not in use. I also liked that there was a positive connection between the bar and the brackets - it looks very secure and relies very little (if at all) on friction.If you look at the Sunny brand of this chin up bar, it has two circular brackets (Check the customer image from David Woctor). I knew as soon as I saw it it was the wrong item.The one I was sent seemed to be decent quality, so I gave it shot. Unfortunately, I am trying to mount it in a wide (39"") doorway, and even though the Sunny brand's box said it would work, it didn't. Not even close.So, I returned it, frustrated both by the item switch and the incorrectly labeled box. I rated the seller 3 stars before I realized that I didn't even BUY from them (on purpose, anyway), it was Amazon that substituted the order. So that's a bummer.Anyway, I was able to return it with little fuss, and even got a call from Triple Play apologizing for the mix-up. (Though, again, it wasn't their mix up).So this isn't really a review of this product as much as a cautionary tale of ordering this particular item. Maybe mine was just a fluke, but I see customer images that differ from the item being sold. If you're buying specifically for those brackets, be aware of my experience.One last note... Triple Play is located about 30 miles south of me (I'm in L.A.), so maybe the switch-a-roo was due to geographical/shipping cost concerns. I don't know.I ended up buying the Beachbody P90x chin-up bar, which was 3x more expensive, but it works in my weird doorway, and has more grip options (though I think it's overpriced)."

It adds some well placed external pockets not found on most traditional internal frame packs (careful how you distribute the weight while packing though).

But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her. I'm glad they are now using a read model. They held up for a few months before they ripped. They served their purpose."

182285,0,"Nice product, but required modifications to fit the Dia Compe brakes on my 70's era Raleigh Grand Prix road bike. I wish they didn't say Cane Creek but I can't complain about the qualtity of the material. In the end, I'll recommend this product to others."
199559,0,This is a good unit. It has more features than most people will need like a fat counter but it breaks up a long boring commute. I like the temperature feature. It was very easy to set up but is extremely difficult to reset every function to zero after your ride. The screen blinks all over and it seems just by luck that you manage to reset it. I'm sure there's a logic to it that I just haven't mastered yet. The instructions are very basic and not much help. But I would still recommend this unit. It's hard to beat its cost for the number of functions it offers.
230065,1,"Running with it for a few weeks- one of the bottles broke, but aside from that it is exactly what I expected it to be. Functional and of good quality (aside form the one defective bottle) - the pouch is just barely big enough for my iPhone, but it fits!"
366554,0,"Hi, I don't know why if in this model my size is 9, because I have an old pair, This one fit me a little bit tight. And I don't know if I Can get another pair, but 9 1/2 with the same price.Otherwise I don't know yet how confortable are in the field, besides is a nice modelThanks a lot"
129748,2,"I don't feel that this was any help at all to the IT Band, I would not recommend this product."
214949,0,"These are all decent workouts, but I agree with the reviewer who said the first DVD is almost unwatchable. They're sitting around a lake, there's about 25 people on the team (and they announce every last one of them by name and profession, which I found both comical and maddening), and it looks fuzzy and jumpy like the thing was shot with an early 90's camcorder. I don't want to be too picky, but if you're paying a bundled rate for five DVDs and one of them is bad, you're not getting a great deal.The second DVD is OK - the team's sitting around a brew pub (!) and the quality is not as bad as the first, but still not great. The final three DVDs are better.I would recommend just buying the individual workouts you want. I bought this collection after doing ""Lean and Mean,"" which I thought was terrific. None of the DVDs in this set are as professionally done as that one."
141206,1,I bought this for my son-in-law's birthday and he loved it!! Great shipping .
6079,0,"I use this rack, with the corresponding Topeak MTX bag. It makes a sturdy and stable combination, although the spring rack is noisy on bumps. If I were to do it again, I'd buy the same rack, without the spring rack. I've never wanted to ride without the panniers, and the rattle would be reduced, without the extra mechanism."
401983,0,"I purchased this pack for day hiking in the mountains. It is well made and has ample pockets and storage for power bars, gps, phone, first aid kit, water and more. The only drawback for me is that I am large framed and it is a little small. Would be great for someone in the 5'-5"" to 5'-8"" and around 135-175 lbs."
340710,0,My adult son helped me set up the pedometer. I carry it with me all day. Today I will take it with me on my 3 mile walk After using this pedometer for 1 month it stopped working.
229583,2,"These are very comfortable, discreet shoes with a very soft sole.Why the one star then?Well, the sole split all the way through (across the foot) after less than a week of normal everyday use. I've never experienced anything like that before. Pretty horrible."
359889,0,The service was fast. When used this frisbee scratched and dented easily. Somewhat disappointed in the product. I expected more.
105740,0,"This front sight tool for the AR15 fits well on the front sight, however it lacks a hole thru the center so that you can get a better grip to turn the tool and adjust the front sight. Older users need assistance to get a grip on tools, and this one is too thin diameter to grip easily. a simple hole thru center would allow a user to get an allen wrench or other item thru it to twist easier."
35577,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."
409110,2,"The bench is poorly packed for shipping, there were holes in the box indicating punctures during transit. I received the bench with a two inch tear in the bench back cushioning. Now, I could try to return that part of the bench, maybe return the whole bench, or get some red electrical tape next time I'm at the Hardware store, tape up the tear and just go on. I'm going the electrical tape route....."
428242,1,These are fantastic! I wear them all day long when I'm refereeing soccer and they keep me comfortable.
158932,2,"The color and feel is good when new, my wife was pretty happy with these gloves. Unfortunately, after 2 rounds, the leathery-like outer layer had worn away, leaving a material like inner layer exposed."
340557,1,"I love that the pedometer has a memory to keep track of a full week's worth of steps, calories, miles etc. The digital clock means I don't have to wear a watch. I have lost 25 pounds since I started walking and keeping track of my steps with the pedometer."
49567,1,"I was very nervous about a trunk rack, but the reviews on this one were good. It is a great rack - I have only used it twice, but so far so good. I was worried about it scratching my car, but nothing. Pleased thus far."
179519,0,"I bought it to shuffle my Munchkin card deck - which as 200+ cards. It makes it through halfway, then bogs down. It is very loud and feels clunky. Cheap plastic. I got what I paid for."
45587,0,"This fits my Kia Soul roof top great even with a sun roof. We used it through hurricane Irene rains and wind, we even put a tarp over the top while parked. Things were damp but not soaked. To pack it just right so the velcro is secure over the zippers is not easy. I have been called a packing engineer by my friends and I can't get it to look like the picture. I suggest u put only things u don't care about getting damp in this unless u buy the liner."
452064,1,These shorts are a great fit. No problems at all. Great lightweight work out shorts. No complaints and they have a great color selection.
280272,2,"I've had my Gravity Gripp balls roughly 6 months now, and with only periodic use, the external rubber coating has totally and utterly broken up, deteriorated, and come off.Can only recommend for limited time use."
78846,1,"This ammo is from Crosman, the big daddy of airsoft.This ammo shoots without jamming, but is lightweight so is affected by winds outdoors. Especially great for indoor shooting with a target (recommend the Crosman &#34;gel&#34; target).Also recommend you buy a small bottle of ammo for the dispenser bottle, with the tilted funnel spout and screw-on cap.A whole lotta fun in one jar."
198049,0,So it's nice but no line. So if you order it order line. Other then that it's a good rod n real.
146060,1,"I purchased this little lamp for my grandson who plays for a team called the Yankees and it was a delightful addition to his room. It matches his wallpaper, bedspread, etc all Yankees stuff. It's sturdy enough for it's purpose which is a decorative piece that happens to give light."
504926,0,"Great product but DO NOT purchase for the 5 year warranty. Warranty is to the date stamped on back of product NOT from purchase date. I received the stopwatch today, July 18th 2012. The warranty expiration date on the product is March 2013. So instead of a 5 year warranty I have a 7 month warranty. Not the biggest of deals but felt like deceptive marketing."
174085,1,"Es una amenaza contra los pavones, lo us&eacute; un solo d&iacute;a y pesque mas de 7 ejemplares, tambien sirve para otros peces, es muy manejable con la ca&ntilde;a por el peso que tiene al momento de lanzar el se&ntilde;uelo en la modalidad de casting, el contra es que se le cay&oacute; la pintura en un solo d&iacute;a pero vali&oacute; la pena usarlo, un solo d&iacute;a y lo regal&eacute;, sin embargo por debajo es como pl&aacute;stico blanco y me di cuenta que la persona que lo usaba esta feliz tambien porque pesc&oacute;."
215018,2,I was looking for an inexpensive golf range finder that would quickly help me pinpoint unknown yardages on some of the golf courses I play. I found the Galileo range finder has too many error variables and lacked the precision I was looking for. It's as accurate as the cheaper etched scopes that go for around $10. I averaged +/- 10% error from 100 yards in. The further out I got became even more inconsistant. I agree with all the complaints about not being able to hold the range finder steady enough to get any kind of consistancy. You also need to have the entire flag visable so blind greens couldn't be scoped. I know how far I hit all my clubs and I need to trust my yardage so I'm sending this unit back today for a refund and I'll bite the bullet and order a $$$ laser unit.
496354,0,"Great price but did not use it yet, original set is adequate for now. On standby for when needed."
138421,0,"The rope chain works great, sharp, quick and does a great job. But, after the third branch the chain snagged just when the branch was falling and it snapped the chain in two and bent the tie straps in the remaining halves of the chain. It can be repaired, but links should be marked with the size and pitch to make it easier to buy replacement links. Or, maker should offer a site to purchase replacement links to repair the chain."
506629,0,My poker table came fast. It came all nice and packed up.Pros-Alot came with the table for the price.It is the right size for a round table.It came looking brand new no problems with it.Cons-It came is green instead of black.I can see how it could get bent if its on a table that it doesn't fit.The table top is a little uneven on one part but not much you can do if it folds up.
14797,2,"I can't believe there are so many gullible people out there. These necklaces don't actually do anything. Look up phiten and pseudoscience.Like David Hannum said, ""There's a sucker born every minute."""
158182,2,"Reticle broke in two places, to the right of and below center, scope worked for a while on Henry 22 lever action. I shot mostly 22 shorts and subsonic LR.I missed a rabbit at 35 yards using CCI Minimag, same ammo I used to sight it in at 25 yards. I set up the target and after few shots determined that it was shooting high and to the right of bulls eye,........... not happy with it I took it off and replaced it with Nikon P22.Today, I installed it on Daisy power 1000 pellet rifle, got it to hit 1"" group then attempted fine tuning only to learn that reticle has broken in two places, disgusting.This piece of crap could not hold zero on a 22 caliber rifle mostly shooting low power rounds and could not take a recoil of an air rifle.Sure Simmons would fix it but I have to pay for shipping and it would only be good for another few shots, GARBAGE.I have $30 pair of Simmons 10x50 binoculars from Walmart that was worth the money for casual use, I also have a Simmons range finder that suits me fine but I will never buy another Simmons scope in any price range. If the price was true indicator of value (you get what you pay for) I would have to pay a lot for gadgets I have but it's not always the case, I have Center Point scope from Walmart on my Marlin 795 auto loading rifle, shot in excess of 3000 rounds of 22LR including CCI Stinger, that scope holds zero from the time I first set it and it costs me less then this crap from Simmons.Beware of the creamy, 5 stars reviews, this scope is a garbage and it will let you down in most critical moment.One star is for quick target acquisition eye piece, I liked it while it worked but some things require quality and reliability, this scope is good for nothing, huge disappointment and waste of money."
266454,0,"Please don't take this as a negative review of the product, it is not. The product itself is what it advertises it is. The strap from the holster to the calve support could be longer or adjustable. I have large calves from years of sports the strap is at least an inch short of being close to fitting over my calve and then to the holster connection point. Without the support strap the firearm slides down all day, it would be great for a short seat time period however wearing daily without that support at least for me is out of the question. It does conceal very nicely though and I'm glad I have it as an available choice."
366214,1,"Bought this rower a couple weeks ago and very pleased especially in light of the price ($170 with free shipping...how can you go wrong with that?).Delivery was fast, to the door and everything arrived complete.Assembly was easy enough although the chain had slipped and it took a tad extra to fix. Otherwise, it was fairly easy. The instructions are not the best but not bad either - certainly have encountered worse. A nice addition of begining exercise regiment is included.Now for the machine itself. The seat is comfortable and glides smoothly as does the pull mechanism. Resistence is comfortable. The only negative is the foot rest - the strap is a bit high and the heel support narrow. It allows the feet to slide out frequently."
248752,0,"I purchased this to add a third burner so my girlfriend and I can make coffee while breakfast is cooking on the two burner stove.Pros: This thing feels like it could support the back end of a 3/4 ton truck. It can crank out some serious heat.Cons: I think it is unnecessarily overbuilt for its purpose and therefore much heavier than it should be, larger than it needs to be, and would have added too much extra weight to my camping kit. It looks like it could support a lot of weight but you wouldn't want that much weight sitting so high on top of a propane canister... too top heavy! Imagine just bumping the table and it falling over. The deal breaker was when I tested it at home I found the valve adjusts in detented clicks rather than continuously variable like my Coleman stove. The first click wasn't a low enough flame to use for rewarming coffee on my Snow Trek titanium mug. I had the same problem with a Coleman lantern I bought once where I couldn't get the valve to sit in a really low position to make the lantern burn really dim.Summary: I returned this and found one on amazon for a little more money that was lighter and had a valve I could set to any amount of flame I wanted. Also, if I wanted one to heat up larger pots I would get one that sits on the table securely and has a hose to the propane tank."
402814,2,"Cycle Ops spent a lot of money developing the product then apparently scrimped on the instructions. Thanks a lot. After four hours of swearing and sweating, I am giving up on attaching my bike to the trainer. The instructions say: Lift up bike by the seatpost and position the left side of your bike skewer into the left cone. Pull down the quick release handle to capture the right side of your bike skewer. Adjust fixed cone by loosening the lock ring and turning cone as needed.Sounds simple enough. But the skewer does not lock into the trainer and there is a gap on the other side. The result is that the bike falls out of the trainer. The instructions do not consider this as a possibility and there is no advice about what to do if you experience a problem. There is no phone number listed either to call for help. I would make another hole in the quick release handle if I had the tools.Unless you are particularly mechanically inclined and have your own set of metal-working tools, find another trainer."
109358,1,"There are many manufacturers of cartridge holders. All are pretty much the same, notwithstanding different colors. What makes this model of the Plano box my choice is that it is lockable. There is a small locking ring molded into the box.As I said, a small point, but to me, important to keep small, curious, hands away from live ammunition."
271047,1,"I bought two of these to use as ""work shirts"" when working outside when it's too cold out for a t-shirt, but not cold enough to use a coat when working up a sweat. They are good quality, thick enough to be warm, but not so thick that they ""don't breathe"". For the price, especially since these will be something that gets dirty pretty fast in my usage, it's a steal.I'm a fairly big guy of average height, and I found the XXL sizing to be spot on for me and for my intended usage. Other folks of different proportions or intended usage may have a different view of the sizing. I wanted the shirts somewhat oversize for ease of mobility and better breathing when working up a sweat, without being too baggy and being in the way."
373478,0,I actually prefer the Shoot N C targets but these will do also. They are a little bit harder to aim at.
23931,1,"I bought these to have compact, versatile utensils at the office and for car camping. They're great for that. I haven't taken them on airplane trips for snacks, but I don't see the utensil causing any problems then. They do have some problems, though. First, they're polycarbonate. I would prefer that they be made from a safer plastic. Second, the fork end is geared for lefties, and I'm right handed. I'm still using them in spite of possible BPA leeching, but if I find something better, they'll be decorative only."
375015,0,"The maps were useful and plenty detailed, however not all of them were current or up to date. It served as a starting point, however, I still had to purchase more current versions of the areas I needed from BLM and USGS"

67656,0,"Product was good. However, I bought it for my grandfather who is very old and not technology savvy. Even for myself it was hard to figure out how the product went onto his bike. So I would suggest sending it with instructions. Other than that he loves the product."

455074,0,"I bought this item for my boyfriend predominantly based on the good reviews. He would have been happier had the battery not needed immediate replacement upon taking it out of the box.

157547,2,I returned this product because the weights were too long and hard to handle. They also were very flimsy and flopped around while I was using them.
168103,0,Could use better and clear cushioning for a better feel and visibility. But for the money it is a good product.
398737,1,15' fit perfectly in my 96 Rinker 180 18'What a difference! My old cable must have been pretty bad under the sheathing. I could barely steer at slower speeds.Installed this cable with helm in about an hour. Now I can steer with one finger if I so choose.
11161,0,I bought it as a gift so it is hard to review it. It looks great and warm. I'm sure he will love it.
509421,0,"Assembly of the stand was a snap. I think it took me 10min without looking at the directions. The stand seems to be heavy-duty; made with heavy gauge steel, and welds looks fairly substantial.Where I subtract stars is the 'feel' of the hammock when using the stand. Whereas when hanging your hammock between two sturdy trees you only get the smooth, relaxing swing of the hammock, with this stand you feel an up-and-down bouncing motion along with the swinging motion. The stand is very long (it has to be though) which allows for flexing, giving the up-and-down motion.Optimally, two trees will give a better overall feel, but if two aren't in the right spot or the right distance apart, then this stand is a decent alternative."
429272,0,"These lugs crimp okay but no better than others and are not 100%. I had to crimp using the proper tool several times on one of the lugs out of four in order to get it to hold sufficiently.

42949,0,"I purchased this scale for my husband to use for fishing (and admit was also excited about being able to use it for household stuff, too). It *looked* like a great product when we got it, but I ended up returning it because my husband, who likes to fish mainly catch-and-release, didn't like the hook. Aparently, there are other scales out there that have a clamp that attaches to the fish's mouth, instead of having to gouge the hook through the fish (like this one). So I don't have any product experience to share for this one, but wanted to point out the design issue that may make or break it for others."
91965,2,"I wasn't looking for anything fancy in pedometers, just something that would record my steps accurately. Unfortunately the Sportline pedometer couldn't even do that. It never recorded my steps accurately. It would always tell me that I did more steps than I actually did. Not only that, the thing stopped working after about a month of use. Maybe I got a bad pedometer, but I won't try another one."
157344,0,"This is a big improvement over a normal (pointed) seat.But if they wanted to eliminate pressure, why did they put a raised ridge RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE where a man does NOT need to feel pressure??Even better would have been a slightly lower ""channel"" in the middle. Also, even with a seatpost that sets it back a bit, it still feels like it is too far forward for efficient pedaling. I had to put the frame in a vise and change the shape of the steel rails in order to get it a couple of inches further back."
47330,0,I was disappointed in this product which I bought for its adjustability. the bean bag weights are very difficult to put back into the pouch. I also think that they will break apart after several times of removing and replacing the bean sections.The fit works well and they are comfortable to use.
149496,1,"This is a great watch. In fact I purchased it to replace one I had bought over 12 years ago. It is lightweight with a very thin profile, water resistant and has both analog and digital readouts. The clean, modern face is easy to read day or night. And the backlighting makes it just as easy to read in complete darkness. As with most Casio's this watch has the full compliment of features, with stopwatch, timer, dual time, and alarm -- all easy to use.When I misplaced my old watch I just HAD to get an exact replacement.."
430370,0,"I purchased this out of curiosity to see if it could even come close to a factory blueing job - it obviously didn't. Remember that age old adage, ""you get what you pay for,"" as it holds true here. It is find for average to below average blueing jobs, but don't expect your firearms to look balanced and thoroughly after using this. A waste of money for me, but it may serve someone else just fine."
503666,2,"The pedometer seems to work fine. I find the radio unsatisfactory, however. I also find that it's too easy to bump a button and make the pedometer talk - loudly.Here are the radio's flaws:1) The display on the unit only displays pedometer info (steps/distance/calories/time); it does NOT display radio frequency. Since the radio operates by scanning - one button sets the frequency to 88.1 MHz, the other scans up the dial to the next station it finds - you have to know when you've reached the station you want to listen to, and the only way to do this is by listening. So finding a particular station can be difficult if you don't know what the station is playing at the moment.2)The sound quality of the radio is not very good. It is not awful, but I find that occasional words can be hard to make out if I'm listening to the news with background noise around me. And you certainly won't hear all the nuances of music from this radio.3) If you walk through an area where there is interference or poor signal for your station, the radio often seems to `go fishing' for a stronger signal, and sometimes changes to a different, nearby station. When this happens you might have to find your station again, by scanning up the dial from the bottom until you hear the right station.4) The only volume control on the unit is on the earphone cord. So you can't replace the included earphones with your favorite headphones unless these also have a volume control.Finally, the ""talking"" feature really annoys me. It's very easy to hit the 'talk' button unintentionally. When I'm setting the radio, or if the unit gets bumped when clipped to my belt or when stashed in my backpack, it will loudly say ""YOU HAVE WALKED 3524 STEPS"" or something like that... this will certainly draw attention to you if you're in class or on the bus when this happens!"

258862,2,"I bought these cards for my son's birthday. He doesn't have many older cards so I thought he would be excited to see what older cards or autograph he might get. What he got was a variety of older cards (since the early 1980's) which had obviously already been picked over for the good ones. In the whole box the only hall of famer was a Kirby Puckett. There was also no autographed card. When I looked at the box there was no guarantee of an autographed card. It says there is a 1:500 chance you'll get one. There are 140 cards in a box. The Amazon description says ""Each box contains ONE Autograph card"". Sounds like false advertising to me. Look around before you waste your money on these cards."

388465,1,"Great knife. Very sharp and the perfect size for me. The sheath is OK but their Kydex one should be better. If you are going to really badly abuse the grip area (beating on rocks or something), you might want to go to another knife style but for most people, this a great knife."
296886,2,"I recently purchased this watch at big discount ($29) via a company for whom I work. The list price here seems to be roughly $70. Quite honestly, you could go to Target and buy a Casio that is far more sturdy and has more features for the same retail price.The band on this watch is very inflexible, stiff rubber and doesn't conform to the wrist very well. The dial around the outer edge is plastic, not metal. In fact it's so plastic-like that you can sometimes see the light gleem through. The numbered ring also doesn't turn very easily and needs to be forced.I'm not that familiar with the Freestyle brand, but this watch really isn't worth more than $20 if you look at other competitors. You could probably buy something better in the GI-Joe section of Toys-R-Us.The background light only illuminates the small digital portion of the face."
437342,0,Great functions. Agree it is a bit challenging to setup but ends up fine. Dissapointed in the accuracy - seems to skip a lot on speed readings even thought the battery is new and the sensors are clearing per specs. Ended up replacing it with another unit.
213226,0,"I bought it for my college dorm room cause i thought it would be fun to have a darty board. I had read alot of the other reviews that said the product was of poor quality, and i have to agree. The doors of the cabinet don't line up when closed. The wood that the cabinet is made out of is of low quality as well, and the finish has many streaks and blotches which are definitely noticeable when withing 10 feet. Overall though i'm happy, i didn't buy it for its looks, i bought it because i wanted to play darts, and for that it works splendidly. I would recommend this if you're not overly concerned about the aesthetics, and really just want to play darts instead."
93623,1,We used these socks for our trip to Patagonia. They felt great and warm right throughout. The only stickler was the price I got on Amazon which was much higher than the prices I saw at Costco about 4 days later .. But the product itself was excellent
39056,2,"Just sent the black model of this suit back. The dye is not set and will wash out every time it gets wet. This suit fits well but not made for the water. Buy the navy one, no problems with it yet. After 3 months it turned brown. Have not found a speedo that is color fast in water!"
476255,0,"If you're looking a for good heavy-weight T-shirt for the gym or the just to wear around, I prefer the 6.1 oz. over this 5.5 oz. shirt. Go the heavier route, you'll be glad you did!"
299885,1,This is a great fleece. It is warm and fits nicely. I bought two when it was onsale at Amazon.com. Definitely would buy another couple like this in the future.
330422,1,"More than I expected. Excellent quality. I thought it wouldn't be made as well as it is, its sturdy. It does what it promised. Shipped in a reasonable amount of time. Good. Don't waste time or money with the generics- this is the real deal. Its worth it."
469611,2,"Very poor quality product. I bought two of these. The handle broke off in the first 10 minutes, it was not even very hard soil. The handle bent on the second one after about 20 minutes. Don't buy"
403404,0,I bought a pair of these gloves and the 1st day on the slope I regretted it.Positive:- They will hold up to light rain/sleet/wet snow- They will hold up to sweat- They do feel warm if temp is near/above freezingNegative:- A stiff breeze makes my hands cold.- After a while out in rainy conditions your hands will be wet- In below freezing temps my hands were coldSummary:Buy a cheaper gore-tex glove. The extra money does not buy you anything here.
407851,1,"I had been looking for a pair of black, sporty, comfortable shoes for walking around campus for a while now. I happened to come across this pair and decided to take a chance with them. I haven't worn Reeboks since I was like 10 years old.. and I think these were a killer deal at 25.99. I didn't want completely black shoes, and I really like how the gum colored sole of the shoes breaks up the blackness of the shoe, and the moderately gray stripes on the side aren't too bright. I'm not a very flashy person, and so I had planned on switching out the shoelaces anyways, but these shoes do come with an extra pair of black laces. There are only three small RBK logos in orange; two as seen in the picture on the tongue and on the bottom front portion, along with one on the upper back portion of the shoe. The shoes are surprisingly comfortable and padded like typical skate shoes, only that they don't have the super puffy, wideness of most skate shoes, which I really don't like. They give the slim feel and lightness of pumas, while retaining the ultra comfort and well-cushioned feeling of any other skate shoes. However, I have to admit that I have thin feet, and these shoes are slim enough that they fit just right. I wouldn't recommend these to people with really wide feet. For anybody else, these shoes are extremely comfortable and have a really great look to them. A sort of subtle ostentatious feeling to them. Well-made product."

186457,2,very disappointed. If you don't really want a workout than this is the trainer for you. There is virtually no resistance. I have a 27 speed road bike and I had to run my bike in the highest gear there was which made the magnetic unit whine and vibrate terribly. I rode for an hour and hardly broke into a sweat. I had a Giant Cyclatron which I liked but the bearings went bad after 4 1/2 years. I think I'll fix and go back to that.
297906,0,"I am a little disappointed in this purchase. In the photo, they look like they are solid, black leggings, but upon opening the box, they are waffle-like patterned, identical to long underwear. I understand I purchased them for skiing, but thought based on the other reviews that they would be of a more versatile use (under skirts, to the gym, etc). So, I am giving them a 3 star review because it is highly unlikely that I will ever wear these pants unless they are for the pure purpose of warmth, i.e. while tail-gaiting at a football game, I will wear them under jeans, when I ski, etc. I am curious as to why no one else commented on this fact?"
125740,0,"Here is a review from one who owns both Leatherman Wave (2 years) & Swisstool Spirit.First I love the build quality of this tool. In fact I had read so many reviews which glorified the quality of the tool I had to get one. The reviews were right but the magic soon wore off. I got the tool as a early Christmas gift for myself, I kept it with me all the time, eager for the chance to use my new toy. When the kids had a hard time opening some boxes ....Swisstool to the rescue!!! But I was SHOCKED when I couldn't open the battery door of a small electronic device my daughter was given. This tool does not have a ""micro"" type screwdriver.... in today's world that is a no no. To fix this I decided to go for the optional ""plus"" tool kit for the Spirit. It added alot of bulk to the tool and fully loaded still only allowed for 8 bits!!! The leatherman bit kit gives you about 40 bits !!! If I have to carry something extra might as well get more bang for the buck. The final straw was when I realized that the pliers don't open as wide as the one on the wave or even a juice model that I had. Don't get me wrong I like the tool and really wanted to love it but facts are facts..... outside opening blades, more bits, & versatility .... I gotta go with the Wave."
31847,0,"the padding is a bit too thick making your grip weak because of a comfort issue.. i have small hands and i took the medium size.. i think it would be better if you get these two sizes up.. overall, it is a good bang for the buck."
326722,0,"First time we ever ordered something like this, so didn't know what to expect. It's very cheap material overall, the dragon looks like it's made out of gold aluminum foil. We didn't even bother with the stickers. The slats are about the same caliber as a paint can stirrer stick from Lowe's and the little hooks between them are so soft and bend and break so easily you don't even realize they are actual metal. The belts we placed on it do not look anything like the ones in the picture. The belts are bulky and weigh down the slats overall. It causes everything to want to droop forward and down. I would hope that we shouldn't cut his belts to eliminate the bulkiness. For now, it's working but we would not recommend this item."
140456,0,"I purchased this game so that I could work out at home--kind of as a ""no excuse not to work out--everyone has 20-30 minutes a day."" After 4 workouts, I am going to try and trade it in for something else and buy some workout videos.My biggest problem with the game is that it takes 40-60 minutes to do a 20 minute workout. I found that if you don't hold the remote or the nunchuck just right, the game doesn't sense your movement. A message will pop up on the screen telling you to do the movement or hold still. So, you then have to redo the movement to get it to sense you. There is definitely a big time lag between between my movement and my avatar. I admit that this is probably user error in terms of how I hold the nunchuck and the remote, but I find I am focusing more on the hand movement and less on the muscle movement. I had the same experience when I used the balance board--major timing issues.The resistance band that comes with the program is really light. I didn't feel like I was getting much of a workout. I tried using my own resistance band or hand weights for some of the exercises, but with the remote and the nunchuck in hand, it didn't work.The lower body exercises seem to be more effective than the upper body, and the system recogzines my moves a little better. I was very sore after two workouts. Both my husband and I had issues with the leg strap falling off.After 4 workouts, I am running out of patience. I think if you have the time and you need something to do then this game might work for you. We definitely got our heart rate up during the workout. But, if you're limited in time then you might want to save your money for something else."
142120,0,"This swimsuit is unbelievably tight. I bought a 36 and I wear size 4-6 woman's clothing. I am not as lean as athlete swimmers, but we all have to start somewhere. This swimsuit is so tight that it is difficult to put on and looks like it was made for a 10 year old girl. I won't be caught dead wearing it. Unless you have less then 10% body fat, be prepared for a very unflattering fit."
434630,0,"Took this backpacking. Was really nice because it was compact. My son got one of these a few years back and for the most part no problems. On mine, the 2nd time I pulled it out to fish, the end of the rod broke off. All I did was lift it out of the container. I didn't force it or twist it. To make it work, I broke the rod off the rest of the way down to the next eye. I was shocked at how easy it broke. It crumbled like dust. I wonder if I just got a defective one."
120033,0,"I purchase this watch thinking that it would be on par with TAG formula 1, which is a plastic watch as well but, the second hand did follow the markings on the face where the second hand marks were. It was a half a second off going all the way around the dial. Plus, the watch was loosing too much time compared to my other cheap Heuer Formulas. I sent it in to Jomashop and they have the worst customer service on earth. I will never buy from them again, and probably be real leery of buying anything else at Amazon for letting this sorry company sell to your customers.Steve Kownslar"

422535,1,Great product. Works just as advertised. Never blows inside out. We've had to buy new ones only when we lose the old ones or someone borrows one and never returns it.
86183,0,"I bought this product after reading several reviews that seemed to indicate the good out-weighing the bad. Well, it worked fine for a few workouts; but the rubber inside ripped when I adjusted to a smaller size. This indicated to me that the rubber is not strong enough to withstand much stretching. I sewed it up in hopes of maintaining the shape and elasticity, but the rubber ripped right through the stitches. Yikes!Currently, I still use the belt for exercise (although the ripped rubber may be compromising my results). The whole experience made me think that the product was cheaply made; and if twelve dollars is cheap, then I certainly got what I paid for! I will definitely be looking for something better while eating my savings!If you decide to buy this, it could work well for you; just make sure that you are gentle with the zipper and careful when stretching it to the next level!"
498240,0,"So, purchase a pair of these because I was sick of the 'Hanes' and 'Fruit of the Loom' pairs riding up, sweating through them, and loosing elastic so quickly. And these are an improvement over the 'typical underwear'. However, I did also purchase ""Champion Elite Active Fit Boxer Brief 3 Pack No Ride up"", and these fit and wear so much better. For the money, the Champion Elite is much better! The ExOfficio still 'rides up', and picking wedges is umcomfortable and embarrassing! Maybe a small would fit me better? Not sure, I am a 34 waist and the sizing guideline said to go with a medium. Not willing to drop another $20 to try the small....... The material feels nice - smooth and soft.Overall the Champion Elite are a better choice in my opinion, no ride up, and cheaper per pair."

473188,2,"The picture shows the right side of the stock as representative of the product -it is not - this is a monte carlo (raised cheekpad) style stock. No where in the product description is this stated. The stock is synthetic in that it is made of what looks like cheap ABS plastic (the same as in drain piping). Also, the recoil pad does not fit properly (not seamless with the stock). In my opinion it is overpriced for what you get. It did fit the rifle as described without alteration."
430933,1,Very nice exercise shorts. I like cotton and these shorts have it. The fabric is nice and heavy and the color is great. Price is reasonable including shipping but not inexpensive.

I did buy it a bit small due to reviews that stated it might stretch. I don't know that this was the best idea. Completely my fault, but it fell off once while while running because the velcro does not fully overlap. Other than that instance, it has been completely stable. I read some reviews about bottle leakage, but I havent had a problem."

However, the tag on the band of the skirt clearly states that these are YOUTH skirts, not Juniors. Fogdog needs to change their description and tags to reflect youth sizing. There is a huge difference in youth sizing and junior sizing. No way my daughter can wear this."
476461,1,"This product was just right for my needs, the size was perfect in our tent, and the bed is quite nice to sleep on.We can recommend this for others, my queen and I are very happy with the queen size since the king size is to big for travel."
196816,0,My husband and I used this for a 10 day trip to Italy. It held up fairly well but wasn't extremly comfortable to carry around. The metal tips fell off of a few of the straps. And the straps on the back were hard to adjust as they kept coming loose. I wouldn't load this pack too heavy. If you want something for light day use--this is a good pack. Not so much for what we needed it for.
33990,0,"The pros: These gloves are very soft and comfortable. I really like the cuff that extends so far up my wrist. I can easily tuck it under the sleeve of my cycling jacket to keep my wrists warm, even when I'm stretched all the way out with my hands down in the drops. They are very warm. In fact, they are too warm for temperatures in the mid-30s, because my hands get very sweaty riding in that temperature range.The cons: There's no padding!!! And I mean absolutely none!!! Perhaps Planet Bike is just assuming that thicker gloves eliminate the need for padding in the palms, but they're not THAT thick. I found myself shifting my hands around to different positions on my handlebars much more often than usual trying to relieve pressure on my palms. This is by far my biggest disappointment. Like other reviewers, I also felt that the index and middle fingers are a bit too tight despite the fact that I have very skinny fingers. As a result, those two fingers get uncomfortably cold while the rest of my hand sweats profusely. When I took these gloves off after riding for an hour in mid-30s temps the inside was soaked with sweat, and I had even sweat through them a little bit."

155976,0,for the price I expected better quality. The size is perfect for teens and the boards are colorful. Only average quality at best.Covering material split at sides after only a few uses and moisture gets inside. Only held up for one summer's use. Would not buy this brand again.
138239,1,"The vinyl exterior of the boot resists dirt and scratches, while the leather internal lining is soft and feels like you are wearing a fully leather boot. The wheels are indoor/outdoor, but the size is more for outdoor use. These skates are very good. They only thing is that the ABEC 3 bearings aren't very smooth, but at this price, replacing them with better bearings is quite affordable. I ended up buying two pairs, one for indoor use and one for outdoor use, then replacing the bearings/wheels for the indoor pair. The Bones Red bearings work great. Skating is fun and great exercise, and these skates are great way to get started."

438458,0,This bike rack is strong and feels secure when it's set up but the actual setup is tricky. I have a sedan and the side straps don't work on the side of the trunk (they'll just slip off) I put both the side and lower straps on the lower part of the trunk and pulled them tight- this seems to work well. I drove a couple thousand miles with the rack and had no problem. It folds for storage- which is nice.

98446,2,I ordered this product in January. It is now the middle of March and after being told it would ship in March I am now being told it will not ship until the end of May? I just canceled the order. Why should I have to wait 5 months for a coffee mug?

Envitably he succeeds in breaking/damaging something on the watch and I'm forced to trek back to the store. Worst of all, the batteries never seemed to last very long. That's where this watch has been a blessing. I no longer have to worry about getting the battery replaced. It's seems very well made and even my husband, the watch eater has trouble damaging it. He's very happy with the design and feel and receives many compliments a day. I hope this is the last watch I have to buy."

11670,0,"First off I'd like to start off this review by saying that like a lot of people have mentioned, the material is super thin. If you take a single layer up to the light you can see the specks of light through it. The collar portion seems to be a double layer though, and the vest itself is decently warm AS A LAYER. By itself, wind will cut right through the thin material and leave you cold. The vest does work well as a thin, insulating layer under a soft shell or windbreaker. The double thickness collar is nice because when you zip up the vest all the way it does keep your neck warm. I would have preferred if the entire vest was the same thickness as the collar though.For the Amazon price, it's not terrible. I'd probably pay a little more and get a Polartec fleece material vest though. Definitely not worth the $40 sticker price that was on the label. But if you plan to just use this vest as an internal layer then it's decent for the $25 price tag."
438325,2,"Had these gloves a few years ago so the newer productions might be better. However, when I had them, the stitching came apart after only a few uses so the padding started to detach from the glove. Also, the fit was just weird since those elastic bands across the back of the hands were completely useless. I suppose they were designed so you don't hyper-extend your fist when you make poor contact. But they didn't even do that. I am going to say that the glove part itself felt fine but I can't say that softer or more comfortable material is terribly high on my list of criteria for bag gloves."
351423,0,"The rear light is very bright and does exactly what it should do, makes you visible from the rear. The headlight makes you visible from the front, but does not illuminate well enough to actually let you see much of anything. This makes the headlight less than ideal for riding down unlit streets. Other than that, the combo light set is a good deal."
80812,0,"The design is nice. Works as expected and you can adjust the flame with your fingernail. Issue I have with this is that the spring on the cap could be a little tighter. When you turn the lighter upside down, as many of us do, the plastic cap wants to go in front of the flame. So I have to use my finger to hold the cap open. Last week the latch to open the cap broke, it's some cheap pot metal, junk! So, I've not cut off the cap and all is well, if not ghetto looking."

399021,2,"I was extremely disappointed because we ordered these for father's day and opened them to see what they looked like before wrapping them only to find that they were Nike sunglasses inside.

426579,1,"Love this bag! It is very spacious, lots of pockets, and the straps are perfect. Even better, the zipper opens down the length of the bag so finding and grabbing items out is no problem. The interior size is comparable to a carry-on wheeled suitcase. Could easily get a duffel strap and utilize the bag in that way, if desired. Had no issues in storing this bag in the overhead bin on the airplane. Would highly recommend this bag for anyone looking for a carry-on suitcase in a backpack style."

True its not as solid as some of the more expensive ones. But we tossed 2 adult bikes and 2 kids bikes onto it and went camping and it worked great.Bad:1. With one bike it wobles a lot. It should come with a couple of shims.2. It doesn't come with the bolt and pin to attach it to your hitch. (That was lame.)Good:1. With 4 bikes it is very stable and doesn't wobble very much.2. It has the tilt function and with 4 bikes it worked great.3. The brackets that hold each of the straps rotate so can attach the straps to different styles of bikes.Summary:For $... this was a good value, I would buy it again. I was happy with the results and satisfied with its performance."

83455,1,"Cute boy's bike---We are pleased with style, color, fit....However, Columbia only provided a general manual on safety, fit, and technical information on adult bikes they sell. Nothing specific on how to put this bike together. Most of it was assembled when it arrived---hardware in the allotted holes, and we did assemble the handle bars, training wheels, etc. Now we just have to do the fine tuning of tightening handle bars with special hex tools, tweaking breaks, adjusting fenders so they are centered... If we had an instruction manual for the specific bike, we would be able to make sure everything was assembled correctly. When I contacted Columbia's Customer service, the only thing they recommended is that we take the bike to a bike store and have a professional assemble. I asked if they have an authorized dealer in my area they can recommend (especially if something were to fail under the warranty down the road...) The CS rep. said ""no, any bike shop could do it."" I asked if they send out manuals to dealers, and if so, maybe I can receive a copy. The response was ""dealers put together bikes all the time and any of them should be able to do it"". If I bought a $500 mountain bike, yes I would probably want a dealer to assemble. However, in my opinion a 12 inch children's bike should be able to be assembled by competent parents who have a good set of instructions. If it's recommended a professional dealer put it together, it should be noted on the description in BOLD letters so I know what to expect before I buy."
395904,2,Ka Bar has allowed some Taiwanese company to make a sub-standard knife and put their name on it. I got the knife and was severely disappointed in the workmanship and quality. The knife was way too light and had a poor balance to it. This is the second Ka Bar knife I have which was made in Taiwan and both are not comparable to the ones I own which they make here in the United States. I am done with this company! I am returning this piece of garbage.

12787,2,"Well I get to be the oddball that posts the negative review on the Crosman 2240 air pistol. I bought two of these so my son and I could shoot metal silhouettes. I bought with confidence after reading all the positive reviews but am very disappointed with the muzzle velocity and accuracy. The Chrony results for both guns was ~ 400 fps with Crosman Premiere 14.3 g pellets. The accuracy for both is about a 2"" group at 10 yds. The accuracy tests were conducted shooting off a sandbag and also with the guns in a vise. My research on the internet indicated that the velocity should be ~ 450 fps and the accuracy should be about a 1"" or less group at 10 yds. As is these guns will not be suitable for silhouette shooting. It's impossible to hit the chickens at 10 yds. The thing is that they shoot about like what you would expect for a $56 gun. If not for the glowing reviews, of which almost all mention good or excellent accuracy, I would have passed them up and probably just bought one higher quality gun. I should have just returned them but I tore them both down. I cleaned and checked for bad seals or assembly problems but found nothing wrong. Everything looked good. I also made some minor improvements in the rear sights. So I guess I'm stuck with these. They are not much good for anything except plinking tin cans at close range. I'm giving 2 stars because my expectations were not met, not necessarily because the items weren't worth the price."

67727,1,"Since its made of stainless steel the sword is really only decorative because if used against a real sword it would be shattered at the first clash of weapons. It is however, very cool looking and looks dangerous so thieves are less likely to try your house if they can see that sword on your wall hangs on your wall. the balance is a little off but its still really awesome for what it is."

129996,0,"beautiful ball- and yes, it is cheaper than the MLS stadium vendors.But it's kind of ""cosmetic""- it's great to look at - just not to play with. It's really glossy leather and it kind of sticks to your skin if you juggle barefoot. Also it seems kind of light and too bouncy- like a beachball.If you like the team, buy it, get it autographed, put it on the mantle. If you want to play soccer then buy a regular, cheap ball."
149090,1,"I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out. I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym. It is very tight, so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product. As far as sizing, I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5'10 and 180 pounds. I bought the large and it works great."
174896,1,"I don't know why I'm being asked to rate this scope. I bought it long time ago, and I thought it was too late to have anything to say about it. But I sure like the invitation ... so I'll say somethin'.It's great!!! All I own are Tasco scopes!, they're so good. And my son told me the Gov'''ment bought scopes for the Navy Seals a few years back and they bought Tasco scopes. So it's gotta be a good scope or someone's buyin' them guys off again 'cause they sure didn't buy them because they're cheap ... the Gov'''ment has 'nuff money they can buy anything they want. Well I like it. The focus is great, and it don't jiggle around after shootin' my 243 a bunch o' times, so it's always in focus. It works whether or not I wear my glasses ... in fact, It's so big I can find it without wearing my glasses. And the wide field of view is great too 'cause I can hook a Maglite to the stock of any of my rifles with a little Velcro and go out night-shootin' in the woods, or anywhere for that matter, and I can see everything just fine as far as a bullet will go. Moon or no moon, the coons don't have a chance, and I don't have to buy one of those fancy and expensive infrared night-vision thingies.Oh!!! ... I gotta go 'cause all this talk about shootin' is givin' me the urge to go out and shoot somethin' ... anything ... and it's darn near supper time -- lickin' my chops at the idea of makin' me a coon caserol tonight. But one more thing ... the size of this thing is great also 'cause it's a safety feature ... it's so big and powerful that you know when yer lookin' down it yer not goin' to shoot yerself; and anything else you accidentally shoot will be so far off you'll have lots of time to run off and hide somewhere.More seriously, I have two rifles set up as sniper rifles ... more customarily referred to as varmint rifles, with no particular reference to the size and weight of the varmint. If you can't put multiple, sequential holes in a circle the size of a quarter at 150 yards, it wont be the fault of this scope. And I do really strap a 3-watt LED flashlight to my rifles and go out at night. There's plenty of light for the crosshairs so you wont need one of those scopes with lighted reticles. And all game, large of small, just stands there and looks into your light like a deer in the headlights."
332990,0,"The clip itself works well. The pole is a normal cheap tent pole, (which has connecting pieces) - which is not strong enough to hold the clip with a rope connected. If you make the pole longer than around 4 feet, it will bend over and will not reach any higher. I'd recommend getting the clip by itself and building your own extendable pole."
206344,1,Great Product. Works great for putting Woman's Mountain bike on bike rack. Holds it steady and is easy and quick to put on and take off.
24556,2,"When I took it out of the box, besides its extremely strong chemical odor, I noticed it seemed to have some kind of wet substance all over it that rubbed off on my hands when I touched it (the consistency of lotion). I have no idea what it was. On the plus side, it comes with a measuring tape to let you know when it is inflated enough. However, the pump that comes with it was extremely labor intensive and a lot of pumping didn't accomplish much. The smell and the wet feel of the plastic was enough for me. I'm going to buy another higher quality brand. I guess you get what you pay for!"

120736,0,"I bought this for my son.CON: Immediately the spring grenade launcher (which is really a single shot gun with very low velocity) broke. the metal rod across the gun body broke out the holes in the plastic. The two piece barrel cover where the battery goes when the grenade launcher (which is now broken) is not used, is very hard to get into place while holding the battery in place and pulling back on a spring loaded retainer. Two type of stocks seemed like a good idea but really once one is in place that's whats going to stay there.PRO: The gun seems to be fun to use and the velocity makes it more competitive with the others playing airsoft.I think they tried making too much flexibility in this gun and gave up rigidity.AIRSoft TEK"

19892,0,"Positives:1.Looks great!2.Fairly Accurate Barometer3.Compass is good to use, if accurately set...Negatives:1. Tempature readout inaccurate because its strapped to you, to get a accurate display you have to leave it off, which is impractical.2.Altimeter is shows I am -220ft and sometimes -500ft... I didn't realize New Jersey was below sea level, so the altimeter seems to be useless to me...Not sure how it is for others.3.The strap is ok, not so flexable...Looks like it will break before the watch...Not sure. Look for a metal or nylon strap maybe.---------------------------------------------------------I'll keep the watch, it took me a long time to decide to buy it or not. Would have to think long and hard if I had to make a similar choice again. Its not great nor is it bad. its FAIR.... 50/50."
378142,0,The Coleman rechargable lantern is a great concept but not the brightest bulb. It recharges handily from either an internally stored 110 or 12v plug-in. Provides adequate light to find your way in a power out situation but not to read by ... at least with my old eyes. I suspect it's manufacturer discontinued by now as neither the Coleman site norAmazon stock it anymore. Tried to find a spec to replace the flourescent tubes. No luck on the web.

149246,2,"I've had this unit for a couple of years, and haven been really disappointed with it. The heart rate monitor is really erratic. Even though I live in a rural area (Santa Fe, NM), stray signals (from who knows what in this sparcely populated area)through the heart rate monitor off. The batteries in the cadence sensor and the heart rate sensor have to be replaced about once a year. Even worse, when the battery in the speed sensor is drained, you have to buy a whole new sensor. My speed sensor battery died in about two years. The cheapest price I've found for a new speed sensor is about $35.00, before shipping. I've decided to spend that $35.00 on another heart rate monitor. It will not be a Polar."
450583,1,"I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites. While I love this shirt, I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5'8"" 155 lbs, decently athletic. I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts (literally stuck). So, order a size or two larger than you think you should wear. I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good, but Large does fit me *slightly* better, so -- order up one size, at least."
486230,0,"This was my first road bike but I rode into the ground. I've easily put 600-700 miles on it in three months and it's ready to be retired. The pedals make an clicking sound and the gears don't change well. In fact, my chain tends to fall off from time to time.I would recommend this bike to someone who is using it to commute short distances because it does ride well around town. I'm 5'5 and it fits me well.Competitive bikers, look elsewhere. For the average rider, it's about middle of the road, but it'll get the job done."

391957,1,"The Timex T5G971 has proved to be a very satisfactory replacement for the 6-year old Timex Ironman Triathlon that I bought in 2003.I like the relatively small size of the T5G971 as well as its light weight and feedback features, which provide such workout details as peak heartrate, time in the target pulse range, calories burned and recovery data. While I miss the chronograph feature of the 2003 Ironman Triathlon, its absence is not a show stopper.The Amazon shopping experience was also very satisfactory. A day after placing the order for relatively slow shipping, I needed to accelerate the delivery time. Amazon customer service was exceptionally responsive, and I received the watch a little earlier than the revised delivery request."
488164,0,"Looks great overall, but construction quality is questionable. Loose thread scraps are everywhere! I have worn and washed them a few times now. So far, I'm still good, but such an abundance of thread scraps makes me nervous."
184293,1,Great board for the price. Solid very heavy well made. The only draw back is the numbers are hard to read.
340090,1,"This pedometer is very accurate, compared to many others I have tried. Best of all, you can just carry it in your pocket, as well as clipping it on your belt. You can choose to put it in your fanny pack or purse as well. It resets at midnight, so you are not adding steps from the previous day. Once in a while I have managed to hit the reset button and lose the count for that day, but that has only happened a couple of times. The ease of use encourages me to increase my steps each day. Unfortunate that this item is only sold in the pharmacy area of Walmart. I found it accidently one day, used it until it got cloudy, replacing the battery several times, once a year, and when I needed a new one, the Walmart had discontinued carrying it. Happy that I was able to find it at Amazon.Com and even ordered one for a friend. You will be very pleased with this pedometer I am sure, and I have seen one that does similar functions at health and fitness stores for twice the price. Hard to beat this Omron HJ 112 in my opinion"

301480,0,"Good quality girdle, but very disappointed that they did not include pads as pictured and it was not noted that pads are not included.

Yes, I could have returned them, but what a pain."
343271,0,"Very cute but way, way big!! I hoped, since it is pink and says &#34; sister strikers&#34; on the back, that I was ordering a woman's small. What I got was very large for a men's small! It is a men's medium or perhaps even large. I think my husband could wear it. The image on the back is very cute, even though it is not stitched. The quality is good."

219111,1,"I bought these gloves to replace my old mesh lifting gloves. My old ones were starting to fray.Pros:Durability - I like that these gloves feel more durable than my old ones. They feel thick in the palms and are protecting my hands well. I think they will last for a while.Wrist strap - I was looking for a pair of gloves with a wrist strap for extra support. These definitely get the job done.Cons:Heavy material on the back of the hand - This is sort of a mixed bag. I like that the material is thicker on the palms because it protects my hands, but it also makes the gloves very hot inside. They are kind of difficult to peel off after a workout.Sizing - I was unsure what size to get. There is no sizing chart available on the listing (can be found here on Harbinger's web site[...]. I ordered a size Medium and they feel a bit tight around the fingers. Hopefully they'll loosen up eventually.Overall, I think it's a good buy. Just be careful about the sizing. If you're close to a larger size, then I'd say just to order a size up."

It is nice and thick, but the surface is far too slick to use for traditional yoga. I took it to a power yoga class tonight and I was sliding all over the place.

The insulated bottle eliminates the problem of holding onto something that is too cold.This is comfortable to carry, even when full, for hours on end. At some point it is easy to forget that you are even holding anything.My one gripe is with the tiny pocket in the front. My slim cellphone barely squeezes in and I would not be able to carry anything larger. It would be nice to have a stretchy pocket so larger things can be secured."

They are so low the only way you can shoot through them is if you are sitting on the ground. You have no choice but to open the triangles to shoot through even from a stool. Even when you do that it let's the mesh barley supported. I will be looking for a stand or another blind with higher windows.Pros. Easy set up, great hight, blends well with surroundingsCons. Shoot through mesh is to low, windows and mesh need separated for better mesh support when the windows are open."

135709,1,"Overall super product! The workouts are VERY intense but since they exercises change you do not get bored and the time goes quicker than running on a treadmill for the same amount of time. It is also motivating to do which is a huge plus! I would recommend doing this with a friend or family member as it makes it even more motivating!Only thing I noticed is that for those people who want to loose weight while doing this, I found that it is helpful to run in addition to the workouts. The workouts are significantly improving my cardio capabilities however I do always feel skinnier after running and then doing this workout versus just the workout alone."

It has nice weight and accuracy in shooting and replica sense. the extended barrel/fake recoil reducer is all plastic and the top of it is open so you see the plastic outer barrel.

235479,0,"This is a very challenging workout system. I sweat a lot when I workout to these DVDs. However, because I am new to working out and I am not in the best shape, it is hard to keep up. Some of the moves are very difficult to perform and they do not show modifications even though one of the girls is supposed to do them. It seems very few of the moves can be modified. I do my own because I do not want to hurt myself. They move very fast also, this seems to be the true ""express"" part of the program. After starting the first day of cycle two and realizing I can't do the moves without hurting myself or any benefit I have decided to just pick through the DVDs I like and shelve the others.I don't think this is a bad product, just one that needs to be advertised for the more advanced user. I thought by completing cycle 1 I would be ready for cycle 2. But that plus the other workouts I did that week did not prepare me to move forward."

Blade easily dulls and the clip to put it on your pocket or pants fell off in the first week. It is held on by tiny allan screws that I kept having to retighten. That said, the knife has seen some rough times and the hinge operates smooth. The locking mechanism still works like day 1 no issues there.

261062,0,"OK you dig a hole, make it a little deeper in the center for extra capacity. It fills quickly if you use the manufacturers instructions of how deep to dig so I would go deeper if you have more then 1 dog. I'm using mine with 2 medium size and 2 small dogs, feeding them twice a day (Iams blue bag) equates too approx 8 loads a day. If you add the digester powder it does compact but either way (with or without powder) it will slowly settle.The overall design is a little flimsy, when placing into the hole DO NOT compact the soil around it. Just back fill loosely otherwise the the structural integrity is compromised. The top won't sit properly and the sides will bow in giving you less poo capacity. I know my garbage guys love it!"

223460,1,I have used the store bought less expensive models before and the difference in quality is incredible. I have asked different family members bounce on the old one first for a few moments and then on the Needak. Everyone says the old one feels like you're trying to bounce on a bean bag compared to the Needak. It cost more but you definately will use it and enjoy it more which ends up making all the difference.

Not sure the maker is making these anymore, hard to come by. Would like to buy another one."
198767,0,"I needed this piece of metal to slide in place as an adapter for my Horton 175HD crossbow. The Lite Rite red dot scope that came installed on the bow finally quit working after 5 years of use. I called Horton directly and visited their website to find a replacement or get the adapter because I received a Horton brand red dot scope from a friend. Horton wanted to charge me $50 for this piece of metal and then $15 in shipping. I looked on Amazon and found it for 1/2 as much (including shipping)! However, after taking the adapter to my local Bass Pro to have it properly installed and trying to install it on my own, it still needed some major adjusting due to the adjustable knob on the stock of the bow that can help level/accomodate for different shooting distances/angles. I had to shimmy the adapter in place and then adjust the scope dots until I was able to get 2 inch groupings."

Inside liner is easily removed and washable. Even the hood is removable and adjustable. I have nothing bad to say about this coat; the best coat I have ever owned."

49401,2,"I purchased this rack from my local bike shop about a year and a half ago. I liked that it was adjustable (I have a Nissan Maxima with a spoiler, which it just barely clears), and that it was cheap. I used it for a while with just one bike on it, and had no problems... at first.A few months ago, I had my bike and my girlfriend's on it to go to the Grand Canyon from Santa Barbara, CA, which is about a 7 hour drive. On the way there, the saddles of the rack began to shift a bit on the poles they are attached to. I thought nothing of it until the drive home, when the bike in the rear-most position began wobbling noticeably in my rear-view mirror. I pulled over, and found that the saddles were slipping down the poles, working their way toward the ends. I had to take the bikes off three times on the drive and wrestle the saddles back to their normal positions. On a recent 10-hour drive, I had to tie my bike's seat post to the vertical pole on the rack so it wouldn't do the same thing. I no longer trust the rack with more than one bike on it, especially since I came home from the Grand Canyon with fresh pedal scratches all over the back of my car.Another thing is that the rubber straps became too stretched out and began popping off their attachments. Another problem is that the weight of two bikes caused the rack to make a big depression in my bumper, which luckily popped out again once the bikes came off. You also can't really open your trunk with a bike on the rack, because you have to slam it really hard to get it to latch again with the rack hitting the bumper.To sum up, I really don't like this rack, and I wish I had a trailer hitch or roof racks so I could get a real bike rack. Hollywood sucks."
5760,1,"This is my first life jacket Ive ever purchased....Mine didnt look exactly like the picture but no big deal...it has a black design that is smaller and not the big white design like in the picture....It fits well, is comfortable, and Im sure it will help me make it to shore if anything happens....It is just a little tight fitting around the neck, but thats what its supposed to do...some of the pics of others look like there is more room around the neck, but maybe they wouldnt work as well keeping your head out of the water.....for 20 bucks you cant beat it..."
194235,0,"This item is innovative (only one other similar product on the market, Black Jax, and I'm pretty sure this was out first) and cool and I really, really like it - don't get me wrong. The problem is that it is not water-resistant nor that great at floating, as described on Nite-Ize's own website: http://www.niteize.com/productdetail.php?category_id=26&product;_id=98We played with it for about an hour, maybe 90 minutes, in the water. It was never deliberately dunked or held underwater, but it had a splashdown or two, and it doesn't exactly bob up above the water, it just doesn't sink like a rock. Water (and, therefore, a small amount of sand suspended in it) got into the part that twists to turn the light on, and the lights went out. No amount of careful cleaning and drying could bring it back to life fully--it flickered a bit, but it didn't last more than a second or two. We were disappointed; we paid about $24 for it at the time (I think from the site Z-Battery).Today I bought the Flashflight Jr (Disc-O LED colors) and the Black Jax Ultimate (solid blue LED) discs, which are very much like this product, so I'll be posting reviews for those in a few weeks. These look promising because rather than twisting-on, they have non-moving press-on type switches."

432188,1,"Excellent purchase. At this price point, I had enough sense to know that the entire compass would not be metal. The case is plastic, but a high quality and durable plastic. It is the guts of the compass that are metal - all metal. I bought it to keep in my waist pack while hunting. As such, I couldn't afford to have the needle making noise as I walked. The needle lock on this compass works very well. It automatically locks the needle when the case is closed, and releases it when the case is opened. The compass is completely silent when closed. The unit is very durable. One need not worry about dropping it. Because the case is plastic/composite, the unit will not rust if wet, or dent if dropped. It is also light weight, which is a plus for any gear that must be carried. Most important, the needle points North each and every time the compass is opened, which is exactly what a compass is supposed to do. In sum, the compass meets all my criteria. It is exactly what I wanted, and a real bargain for the money. I've ordered another for my son's waist pack."
303652,1,"P90X Extreme Home Fitness with Tony Horton - Set of 13 DVDs, Calendar, Fitness Guide, Nutrition Guide, & Workout LogAll I can say is WOW!

I like to think that I'm a very fit person, but I'm certainly not a fanatic...I love the P90X combo package, but I really only utilized the items that I wanted to. I got this hoping to change my routine up and 'discover' some new exercises, and Tony Horton delivered. I didn't use the nutrition guide at all, as I like to eat how I want/feel and to me that part of it is a little too involved.

311783,1,"After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing. Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com. I'm 6'6 and 220lbs, broad shouldered, lean and decently well muscled(working to gain). Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with (alot) of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back. The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight. The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both. I have not done any training in the shirt so cannot at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking, energy level/recovery from compression or chafing. I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training. I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T's. Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success."

The knife is suitable for opening taped boxes, but the blade is not much larger than an exacto-knife blade. The scissors is best used for clipping loose threads. The screw driver will allow only very slight twisting force on a small, straight blade screw. The tool I find most useful is the nail file. It makes short work of dressing torn finger nails."

I left the tip eight inches below the grass surface and threw the rest in the recycling bin. What a piece of shit!"
360576,0,"I actually bought this pull up bar twice.I bought it about 4 yrs ago. Easy installation, durable, easily supports my weight (~160 lbs) and a great work out. I moved out of that apartment and I lost the bar in the move somehow, so I had to buy another. If that was my only experience with this bar, I would have given it 5 stars easily.I recently just bought another one for my new apartment, and the bar and the brackets are the same but the screws are definately different. I put them in with a manual screwdriver and the screws strip VERY easily, which was quite annoying. If you buy this bar, do yourself a favor and either buy new screws or use a drill for installation."

78206,1,"This review is actually for the Schwinn Varsity 700C which I understand is rebranded as the Schwinn Katana 54 on Amazon (katana actually means ""small"" in hebrew and I suspect it is therefrom derived)In my younger days I used to ride my bicylce everywhere. Alas, a few decades have passed and renewal of my bicycle riding seemed like an easy and fun way of exercising. I wanted a bicycle with a drop handlebar probably more for sentimental reasons than anything else. I quickly learned a few things; these drop handlebar bicycles are called road bikes and are expensive and seem to built for taller people. I am only 5'7"" with an inseam of about 30"".The Schwinn Varsity was really the solution. It is reasonably priced and is a little smaller than most. The seat is adjustable without tools. However, to make it as low as possible, you have to (temporarily) remove the reflector.I purchased this bike at Walmart which does not seem to stock these and must be ordered. Howver, when purchased on line and sent to a store, Walmart will assemble the bicycle free of charge (at least they did for me in Valley Stream NY).The bicycle is very light and comfortable. The gears shift smoothly and the brakes are very good. In the beginning I was annoyed with the high position of brake lever and the lack of a side handle, but I have gotten used to it and its OK. There are fittings on the pedals which were very annoying so I removed them.I have only driven it around 30 miles since I bought it, but so far I have no problems and everything works fine. The bicycle is comfortable for shorter people such as myself but may be too small for tall people (although the seat may be adjusted quite high). I would like to lower the handlebars a few inches to be at the same level as the seat, but I can not figure out how."

142177,1,"This is a fantastic suit, classic Speedo quality and flattering design.If you've read all the reviews and are wondering what's going on with the sizes, here's what you need to know:1. It is cut for serious swimmers, not to wear while sunning yourself on the beach. That means it grips tightly around the straps and leg holes. If you're muscular, you won't notice. If you're less muscular, you might bulge a bit. That doesn't mean the suit is too tight!2. The sizing is accurate, that is a 36 is a size six (which is what the chart tells you it should be). I'm 141 pounds, 5' 5"", 27"" waist, and wear a size 6 jean. The suit fits me perfectly.3. That said, I expect it depends quite a bit on how you're built.If you're pear-shaped, with a narrow torso, you should be fine. My butt is 39"" (39.5 on a bad day) but my rib cage is only 29"" or 30"", with a bust size of 35"" fully expanded. My shoulders are big, but basically: the parts of me that are INSIDE the suit (stomach, torso, chest) are relatively petite. The parts that are OUTSIDE the suit (shoulders, butt) are where I carry a lot of my weight.If you have a thick torso, big waist, or large bust (as one of the other reviewers noted), the suit probably WILL be tight for you. I could see where someone with a 34"" or 36"" rib cage (or a 38"" or larger bust) could run into problems.So if your butt or shoulders are largish--no worries, get the suit. If your waist, chest, or bust are on the large size--consider going up a size or two.Hope this helps!"
103892,0,"I love this chair and get compliments all the time. It's comfortable and easy to set up but it does get knocked over in the wind. The canopy helps against rain as well! Perhaps due to too much sun during use or long periods of storage, the plastic frame warps over time. This causes it to lose it's spring and makes folding near impossible. With a lot of patience and coaxing, it'll readjust back to normal. I managed to break one trying to get it to reset so I have to buy another."
429533,1,Super easy to assemble! Previous reviewers gave some good advice! Use a little cooking oil to slide the rubber covers onto the handles! Worked GREAT!

470232,0,"Surprisingly, my Airdyne was delivered disassembled, and with no accompanying assembly instructions of any kind. I am no mechanical genius, and this didn't look like a job for the faint of heart in the first place. Unable to obtain any assembly instructions from either Amazon or Schwinn, I tried a local bike shop. For an $85 fee, they assembled my machine. When I inquired about the lack of assembly instructions, they told me that this was a deliberate omission, and that self-assembly invalidates the product warranty. I can't vouch for the absolute accuracy of all I was told, but I feel that I should at least sound a faint alarm.

377958,1,"If you need to buy a seat-post type rack because you have a suspension-type bicycle, this rack works well for bicycle commuting. If you have a traditional ""hardtail"" bicycle, I would stick to a traditional rack. Previous reviewers reported two problems and I road-tested this rack against their comments.(1) First problem reported by another reviewer was the rack not staying in place. I didn't have this problem at all. Remember to tighten the screws alternately a little at a time (top right, then bottom left, then top left, then bottom right). Tighten screws alternately and repeat several times until all screws are tight, and your rack shouldn't slide. (Don't tighten one screw all the way then go on to the next; alternate each a little at a time so the tension is even.)(2) Second problem reported by another reviewer was the loaded bike bags bumped into the spokes and caused damage. I tested the bags at both the 25-pound limit and the 40-pound limit. If you turn sharply, get up speed, or go over a bump, the loaded bags can definitely bump into your spokes. You wouldn't want to fully load the bags for cross-country or sport riding. I just use my bike to commute to work, so I tested it by stopping on the way home to get groceries. At 25-pounds (bread, milk, canned food), there is no real problem, but at 40-pounds (one bag of cat litter loaded on each side), the right-hand bag did tend to bump my spokes if I got up any speed. So if you fully load your bags, go very slow & easy. Try the hard-sided ""grocery getter"" bags from Sunlite brand."
71219,0,"My wife and I wanted quick access to a cold drink of ice water while working out in the yard. Thus, we only wanted a small, inexpensive, cooler jug. This is a good one for the money.It did however leak around the back of the spigot (water tap) when we first tried to use it. I was about to return it for an exchange. I then took a closer look and realized that it was an easy fix to stop the leak. The spigot/tap is simply a threaded pipe that mounts through the body of the jug. There is a typical nut, with a rubber washer beneath it that threads over that pipe. When the hole was punched for this spigot/tap to go through, some plastic shavings were not properly removed. Those shavings were preventing the washer from sealing properly.I simply loosened the nut and removed the spigot/tap. I cleaned off the shavings around tap hole and reinstalled the spigot/tap. Holding the nut in place with a crescent wrench, I turned and firmly tightened the spigot/tap. This solved the leak problem.No one likes to repair a newly purchased item. This few minute fix however, was better than returning it. Other than this minor inconvenience, I thought the product was a good buy.DBColumbus Ohio"

We purchased the adapter hose and connected it to a 20lb tank. The grill lights with one push of the starter button and the controls are accurate. This grill puts out some serious BTU's - no issues with heat, that's for sure. The stove grate is a great accessory to have, as well as an extra grill grate. Both the grill and griddle's non-stick surfaces are as good as our expensive cookware at home. Some people may say this grill is ""too heavy"" but my wife had no trouble at all (she's tiny).

117151,1,"We love this seat. My son is 11 months, and although it is recommended that this seat and all products like it (including trailers) be restricted to children 1 year+, I feel confident that he is safe riding in it. We first used it when he was 10 months old. He sits very comfortably in it, and the 3-point harness is perfectly secure. We went on a fairly long ride today, on road and dirt, and my boy giggled the whole way. He loves being able to see everything, and be a part of the experience. I like having him right in front of me, snug between my arms, so I can talk to him and point out the sights. He fits great, and it is really easy for me to control and maneuver the bike with him there. I am almost 5'9"", fyi, so not sure if a shorter person would have trouble or not. I kinda don't think so, because a bike that fits the rider will put the rider's torso at an angle that should accommodate the seat and child, provided the top tube is long enough for the seat to fit in between the stem and the seat. The seat is simple to install (all you need is an allen wrench and about 3 minutes), and I do believe it will fit most modern bicycles. The stems on some of the retro bikes might be too skinny to accommodate the ""stinger"" well, but most beach cruisers, mtn bikes, and road bikes should be alright. The iffy part will be how well the seat fits under the shift/brake cables. It was easy to mount onto my Gary Fisher HiFi, but I had to adjust the angle of the shifters and brake levers (a 1-minute process). It works great right now, but it might become problematic when my son's legs grow more. That's because of the way the cables cut across the leg slots very closely. If his legs protruded above the lip of the leg protectors, it might not work without further adjustment. iBert, by the way, is a great company when it comes to customer service. I dropped the seat when installing it, and it landed on the lap bar just right, breaking it at the hinge. I emailed them, and they had a new one, free of charge, out to me a couple of days later! I bought mine from a local bike shop in Coronado, CA, where they are pretty popular. I've been using it up in Boise, ID, though, while visiting my folks, and people keep stopping me to ask about it. They can see how much fun we are having using the iBert, and how easy it is for me to ride around, and they want one. I certainly recommend it over other seats!"

I have machine washed these, stuck them in the dryer ( a big no-no I'm told) and worn them inside and out; they just keep smiling and continue to keep my feet warm and comfortable. Dont waste your money on other wool socks. Trust me, these wont disappoint you."
218595,0,"Agree about the poles- they bend easily. I wrote to Coleman after one got bent beyond use, and they sent me a new set of four. I wish they would use better steel. I can set up the screen house by myself, though it's a bit awkward because of the pole length and shape. Make sure you guy it out with the provided lines, otherwise if you open a door the whole way it will collapse. I've used it about a dozen times now and some of the web loops are starting to rip out of the seams. I think it stretches out a little too tightly. Good for fair weather car camping, but I would collapse it if the wind starts blowing hard. Opening in the top lets rain collect on the top fabric piece, which will eventually start dripping in, but if you tie the top a little tighter to the hub it helps. Wait for it to go on sale and you'll be happier.Feb. 2011 update: After using this for several seasons, I cannot recommend it. The steel poles are of inferior quality and bend way too easily, even when setting it up."
80230,2,I ordered 3 balls from Amazon.com for the police toy drive. The football and basketball arrived looking great. This soccer ball arrived as a piece of flat rubber in a plastic sack--completed uninflated and without the means to inflate it. The ad should say that this will arrive not ready for play--and additional supplies will be needed before a child can use it. Such a disappointment--it is going right back!
280215,1,"Initially, I thought I would get the cheap quality jump rope. I was wrong. It is a smooth simple medium-weight rope that swings without twisting the chord. Although it seems to be slightly long for my height(5'10), I managed to jump more than 500 times without stopping. With the cheap ones at the gym, I could only jump around 300 times. So, it gets me going. And, that satisfies me."
167987,0,"Pros: Nice big display. Easy to use. I like the silver color. Has lots of features. Indiglo is very cool. FLIX is neat but not sure how often I will use it.Cons:1) The Velcro band marks a major drop in quality from Timex. I have had 2 velcro bands from Timex before and this one is clearly of inferior quality. The band has sort of a soft ""steel wool"" feel to it (a bit of an exaggeration but the best analogy I can come up with). Especially around its borders, it tends to prickle and irritate the skin. I tried to get used to the band but kept getting a ""prick"" every once in a while and it became annoying. Skin started turning red from the band.Fortunately THE BAND CAN INDEED BE CHANGED (contrary to what others have said) and I changed to my older Timex velcro band which is nice and smooth and comfortable. Timex was helpful in that they tried sending me a better velcro band, but it was just the same poor design. They did agree to send me a resin band at no cost to replace the velcro one (but for now as I said I will stick with my old Timex band which is great).2) There are really only 2 timers, the regular timer and 1 interval timer with 9 sections.They sell it as 9 interval timers but it is 1 timer with 9 intervals.Timex had told me that I could use the 9 timers independently of each other, but you cannot do this (as far as I can tell).I wanted to set up 2 different intervals. Interval one for day 1: 5 min, 2 min, 5 min & interval two for day two 10 min, 5 min, 10 min, but this is not possible. The only option is to start on interval 1 and run through all the other timers in sequence - you cannot choose to start at, say, interval 3.(I asked Timex if I just was not using the watch correctly, but they did not reply to my question - so perhaps this is user error, but I cannot find a way to choose which interval I start on).3) Alarm is simply not loud enough. The watch has multiple alarms but I am sure it is not loud enough to ever wake me up and I am not a heavy sleeper."
87631,1,Best gun I have ever owned I have many other bb/C02 guns and this is the best of them so far. I got mine here on amazon because i could not find this item in the stores. This revolver shoots very fast and Strong. IT CAN GO OVER 425FPS AND UP TO 400YARDS (4 football fields!) It has a little kick to it. I would recommend buying the extra ammo clips for it because this gun just comes with one. and it will run out quick as you pull the trigger ;) It shoots about 60-90 bb's/pellets per C02 cartage [ brand crosman C02] I would not want to be hit within 250yards of this thing... it would hurt very bad!

42857,0,"I decided I wanted a range finder when I played golf with my father-in-law. He had the Bushnell Yardage Pro 1000 and it worked great. Just point, shoot, and the yardage to the hole was returned promptly every time.I was really excited when I first got this range finder ...until I got it on the golf course. It is much smaller than the YP1000, but the Sport model's superiority ends there. When you are inside 150 yards, it can range on a flag fine. Any farther than this and it becomes more trouble to use than it's worth. You have to hold it very steady and it takes several seconds for the range to register (if it is going to register at all).This range finder may work fine for hunting, but if you are going to use it for golf then spend the extra money and get a better model. I am currently looking at the Bushnell Yardage Pro Tour XL 20-2025, but I haven't tried it out yet."

252994,1,"These shorts are great (I bought three pairs in three colors). I had a hard time finding my size (35 waist) from other makers, but these fit great and have a little stretch built in for comfort. My old shorts were all cotton, got lumpy and wrinkled by the end of a round, and looked well-worn. These keep their fresh look, resist goose poop stains, feel comfy and classy, make hot weather golf a walk in the park."
310358,0,Not bad for the price. However I can tell that this isn't going to last a long time. It feels kind of flimsy and the locking mechanism seems like it will jam up pretty easily. For under ten bucks it will get the job done but if I was planning on going camping very often and needed something really durable I would probably go with the Gerber E-Tool. I think the Gerber is probably more versatile as well.
263355,2,The band is cheap and the gold on the band rubs off very easy. It costs more to buy a replacemnet band than the original watch. You can't even buy a better quality band.

33755,0,"My first manual treadmill, and a decent product. Does take some time to get use to. Don't buy this if you expect to use this for running.

223708,0,"This is my second spinervals dvd. While I am in no way claiming to be a pro or experienced rider, I am not a beginner. The naming is misleading. It was just too easy. The dvd is for beginner to intermediate. Even when you are doing the high cadence sets the gear ratio is not hard enough to get my heart rate up close to i. The hardest part is a pyramid set. I am now using this dvd as my recovery day exercise.I am much more a fan of Suffer-o-rama. I have been doing this DVD for the past winter season, and I still get my butt kicked every single time. Plus the ""scenery"" on the tempo exercises is not too bad either."

256443,1,I am giving these a 4 star review even though I couldn't use them. Be careful they run big. I am an 8.5 and these which were supposed to fit 8-9.5 were too big. Perhaps that are 8-9.5 men's. (That's what I get for rushing to buy these things a few days before a trip.)

321625,1,"So, I started shopping for an Airsoft gun for my 11 year old son and came across this one. After carefully reading the different reviews I decided to give it a ""shot"". I was very impressed when it arrived at how realistic it looked and the weight of the gun itself. Granted this is the first airsoft I have purchased but over all a very good product. **The only thing I found as a design flaw is the way the scope turns on and off. If you don't make sure you grab the base of the on/off knob you actually take off the cap where the batteries for the scope belongs. I fixed this with a piece of electrical tape around the cap and base**. Great first gun for a great price IMO..."
510780,0,We bought our first Butterfly ping pong table cover in 2009. It lasted a couple of years before it got torn. I recently ordered a replacement one- same model and brand.

312949,0,"I bought three of these lanterns for approx. $10 each. I am slightly disappointed in the overall quality. Not disappointed enough to bother returning them though.Pros: Relatively inexpensive, decorative, cute, nice colorful touch for patio parties and possibly light-duty emergency lighting.Cons: They are quite lightweight and not intended to last a lifetime. I believe they are made of tin. They are marked with a sticker on the outside of the metal reservoir that says ""do not fill above this line"" but the trouble is, you can't see when you're filling the lantern when you get up to the line. You just have to guess. There is a little lever that lifts the glass part up and down, so you can light it. It's very apparent that this little lever is not heavy duty enough to withstand the pressure you have to put on it to raise the glass - after raising the glass just once, the lever bent, and I can tell it will eventually break. You can raise the glass manually with your hands, without using the lever.If you are looking for a whimsical decorative touch to your patio, this will probably do just fine; just don't expect it to last forever. If you are looking for a quality piece that will function well for years and years, you'd do better to keep looking, and invest in a heavy duty brass lantern."
354198,0,"So I saw these shoes at David Z. They wanted $60. I was going to buy them until I Googled and saw that Amazon had the same shoes for $15. Well, it turns out that the shoes are slightly different, have a lower build quality and don't fit exactly the same. I can't say if these are knock offs because I'm not familiar with the company. They are comfortable though."
447772,0,I was a little disappointed that this whistle wasn't louder for the price. However it is solidly constructed and this version (the orange one) is highly visible. I attached it to my neck knife and I'll say so far the lanyard on the whistle is very sturdy I've pulled on it and hung it on things and it hasn't broken. Overall it's a good whistle but I expected it to be louder for the price and brand name.

It is best to set it up and leave it in place, when colapsing it and moving it there is a tendancy to get really bad pinched fingers as the bike in the stored position still has movement; it is also heavy and very awkward to move around.

But man is it nice to put this thing on.Covers the tummy completely, which almost NEVER happens with any shirt. I almost always order XLT's to get enough out front to cover the gut (resulting in the huge, sail-like profile of most shirts), but this does. And without 50"" long sleeves or other silly looking results.Bottom line, if you're a big guy with a big gut, you'll like this sweatshirt. Best fitting one I've ever found."

Tried this glove when our old ones wore out, mainly because we hadn't found any batting gloves we liked in local stores, it was reasonably priced, and available for prime shipping. It is an alright glove but seems more cheaply made than our previous ones. Neither of us liked it enough so we went ahead and ordered the newer version of the Techfire despite the extra cost."

363377,0,"I used this product for a while. I would recommend this product but not for someone who has a chunk of stuff on his key chain. I had about 4 keys, one usb drive and this swissgear item. Due to the longer length of this item as compared to standard keys, it is probably subject to uneven forces which causes it to break (the metal loop which loops in the keychain and is the thinnest part).

I opened it and took the bag and gloves out and could not believe how small it was. (The gloves were normal size and seemed to be sturdy) But I'm 5'5 and the actual bag comes to my knees. It's obviously shorter than a 6 year old (or a 2 year old for that matter). So I figured I'd try to hang it, but there is nothing at the top to hang it by? It's just tied off at the top.I never send anything back, so I will end up keeping it for my son to use his imagination with, but I was let down with product this for sure."

230009,0,"Overall i like this airsoft gun. it shoots preety straight. its light and compact. the only cons about the gun are that the scope sucks. it has a + as the dot and it is to blurry to really see through it, the clip w? the bullets looks preety cool exept for that the clip doesnt catch so you have to hold it to shoot. and also the other clip it comes with only holds 10-15 bbs at a time so that sucks to. and also the gun broke a few months after i got it. the safety doesnt work so it is always on auto and it doesnt shoot. in my opinion if you buy this gun be prepared for it to break and/or replace some of the parts."
423877,0,I was hoping the hole was large enough to slide over an olympic bar collar but it doesn't. It also only sticks to the full metal dumbbells not the ones with any vinyl covering.

163275,1,"&quot;Drops of Emptiness&quot; is a CD compilation of the songs and poetry of Plum Village, a Buddhist monastic community located in southwestern France. The monks and nuns of this community are refugees from Vietnam, but their influence reaches far beyond the Vietnamese or Buddhist traditions. Their words are inspirational: drawing strongly on images of nature to move the listener toward meditation and prayer. The format is simple, most of the poems are either chanted or sung acapella, a few are accompanied by the deep reverberations of a bell or lighter taps on a &quot;song lang&quot; a traditional Vietnamese instrument used to keep time.For those interested in exploring Buddhism, this CD is a must. For those interested in new insights into spirituality, &quot;Drops of Emptiness&quot; is anything but empty."
42116,0,"First off, the CYMA gun is not the one featured in the picture of this page. The charger is in a different location, and this gun has a different set of accessories. That being said, this gun is not that bad for the price of $20 that was listed here several days ago. However, I would not recommend paying more than $20-$25 for this gun. You can get a much better Airsoft for $50. To start out, this gun is fairly sturdy, with a good weight to it. It shoots at about 200fps when the battery is fully charged, and outdoors with little wind, your shots are likely to go 50-100 feet. It features semiauto and full auto fire, and you can empty the 40 round magazine in just a few seconds. It comes with quite a few accessories, all of which I found to be fairly worthless in practical application, they are all there just to look cool. First off, my gun did not come with a red dot laser, probably due to some kid blinding his sister and their parents suing CYMA. The included flashlight is extremely dim, and will do little more than just give away your position. You could easily change out the bulb or modify the flashlight to be brighter, but at that point you're better off just getting a better gun with better accessories. The detachable sight is misaligned, and aims way too far to the right. It's glued together, so it can't be taken apart and recalibrated. It's good looking, but totally useless. Same is true for the front handle seen in the picture. You can't support the weight of the gun on that handle without it popping right off, unfortunately. The unjammer/unloaded that was provided was broken when I recieved it. This gun comes with a speedloader, which is nice, and works well. Overall, a decent gun for $20, assuming you aren't looking for all the accessories to work great. You might have better luck than I did, however. I would not recommend this gun for competitions, just because it is so low-end.Edit: After a month or so of light use, the gearbox skipped a gear during normal use, and the gun would no longer fire. I had to open up the entire gearbox assembly and reset the gear before the gun would work again. Not saying you'll have these problems, but this kind of stuff can happen with a cheap gun like this."

222839,2,"This stability ball is very thin and does not seem to be anti-burst. The company I usually purchase from is Perform Better, and their stability balls are much better quality. For my studio, they do not seem professional. For individual home use, it would probably be fine."

328316,0,"I was excited when I opened up the box. The cover seems to be made of rugged material, the zipper seemed to seal well, and the seams were well made. But as soon as I put my 14ft kayak in it, it was obvious the fit was attrocious. I did not expect a cover meant to fit both canoes and kayaks of various to fit mine like a glove, but the results were ridiculous. After seeing other reviews complaining about the fit, including the one that said a 16ft cover would fit a 16ft boat and not an inch longer, I was careful to select the 14ft cover size. When I put the thing on, however, there was easily two feet of extra material at the end as well as a considerable excess (well over 2ft) to account for the girth of the yak. The box said 14ft, but I suspect they sent the 16ft'er (I couldn't help but notice the size printed on the box was in fact a sticker place over the 18ft model). All things considered, I haven't decided whether to return the thing or try to take in the seams myself.Bottom line, quality of materials seem good but the fit is incredibly dissappointing."
276758,1,"I trust Everlast with nearly all of my MMA and fighting products. That being said, I wouldn't use these gloves in a real MMA fight. They a great for training and light bag work, but not for striking hard targets such as a person. I have used these now for several weeks and they have been thoroughly broken in, but they are still a bit stiff and are starting to fray around the edges. The finger holes and straps are also a bit weak. That being said, use these for training, at the price you can replace them quickly enough."

I was looking for something lighter weight so though I would give these a try.I found the socks comfortable enough, but they are relatively coarsely/loosely woven and don't really seem have the quality that I expected. After just one machine washing they are starting to get a little fuzzy.Good $5 socks, sub par $15 socks."
28,1,"I didn't want to pay $20-ish dollars for this, but I relented after waiting a year, and not finding it on sale.My 3 and 5 year old (and their friends) have had a blast with this giant tetherball set.First of all, it's outside time for the kids. Any age group can participate in playing. There's no stringent rules or start/stop time, etc. Easy to start or stop a game.My 3 year old's coordination has improved greatly, and I see his self esteem and self confidance climb when he whacks the ball back to his sister. My 5 year old can basically play this by herself -- just whacks the ball and allows it to come back around to her.I have treated the set ""gently"" (we store inside when weather is rainy), and it looks new after 8 months.All in all -- well worth the money spent, and is still used 8 + months after purchasing."

188061,0,"I bought these after reading several other reviews from different sites. I returned them the next day. They are simply not worth the money. Go to Home Depot and buy a nice $20 pair of work gloves (and add a very thin, useless layer of insulation) and you have the same thing.Also I read that these gloves run small in their sizing. I bought an XL (which I normally wear) and they were quite a bit too large for my hands. Since they are work gloves, they need to be on the tighter side to be useful. There is too much slack in the palm and the fingers are too long. I've read a lot of good things about these gloves, and maybe the size large would work better, but I was not impressed for a rather high price tag."
348800,2,"I placed the order for my 5 year old grandson as a surprise for him doing great in school. I ordered a blue youth football and received a red intermediate foot.

Fortunately, my daughter did have an air pump to pump up the football but what if she didn't have? Here stands a little boy with a new football that he can't play with."

126384,0,"It comes out of the package looking exactly like the photo. It is exactly what it's advertised as: a cheap novelty towel to wave at a football game. And that's exactly what you get. Don't expect to use this for a shower, the beach, or any sort of activity where a real towel is warranted."

Loved it. kinda picked up where i left off from. Wanted to find something to do some better carving so i got a flowboard. Its a great concept and works for the most part. you need steady incline as well as room to carve/turn. This board does not allow much for straight riding. It feels great carving given you have those conditions. This is not a casual riding board. I would only recommend this board to people who are looking to carve specifically, Think of this board as a snowsled. it goes down hill only. You do the rest of the work.. Its a heavy board. I still give it a three though because given the right road this baby will do wonders. Just not too many my way at the moment..."

374293,0,"I understand that the comfort rating in the description has a question mark by it, and I would be more accepting of that, EXCEPT on the package it is ABUNDANTLY CLEAR the the comfort rating is 50 degrees F.It says it in more than one place, and says it in HUGE type on the front of the package. I wish I could attach a picture to show it.Additionally, on another part of the package, it shows that the Tenderfoot sleeping bag is comfortable from around 45degrees, to around 55 degrees, and it has listed the temperature ratings for all of the other Texsport sleeping bags.(if you want one that is rated for 40 degrees, get the one called the ""Caprock"".)Other than that, the sleeping bag seems to be of good quality, but we haven't used it yet,"

The clarity is amazing, and it works in tandem with my night vision scope (I had to move it forward on the picatinny rail to mount the night vision behind it).You will need to order raised mounting loops for it because the 50mm lens is HUGE compared to a 40mm. I used the 1"" riser type on my picatinny rail. Works great.J"
284210,0,"The information presented on Amazon called this chair ""Oversized"". I wouldn't use that term to describe it. The description also lacked a mention of the chair's listed weight limit.

Not what I'd call ""oversized"".The chair isn't bad, just not for big guys who stand 6'6"" and are well beyond 240 lb."

419342,0,"1. the ""Oxford"" shorts are shown as a dark maroon kind of colour, which is what I wanted, but NO! I received them in a heather grey colour, even though the packaging still says ""Oxford"". So BEWARE! I don't know if it is a photo error or a packaging error; either way, not worth the postage to return it2. they are small but NOT THAT SMALL! I read the reviews extensively before finally buying them. Previously, someone reviewed saying that she's an S-M and a XL would fit perfectly - which is what I bought. But both pairs arrived amazingly big. I think my boyfriend can wear them! I folded the waistband (note: elastic band, not strings) down twice and the shorts are still too long and too baggy and make my butt look 50% bigger. I'm a size 4 or 6 (ie S or M), and if I were to buy again, I would get size M, or at most L. So be careful when you up the sizes!Unfortunately these were not a good buy for me. I gave it 3 stars, however, because I think if you were lucky enough to get the right size and colour, they would be pretty good and they seem very comfortable."
100847,1,"After doing months of research I went to my EMS store and tried on various packs including this one. The difference was immediately evident. The molded back and straps were simply far superior to their counter parts. I even tried on an Osprey and was surprised at the difference in quality of fit considering the Osprey reputation.I am only new to backpacking but I knew investing in a good pack was the smart thing to do and it paid off out on the trail. Expecting to have all sorts of aches and pains returning from my four day hike I was again surprised to find my pack had done its job to perfection. Barring one sore muscle from my own ineptitude I was fine no back pain no nothing (Even though as a novice I over prepared and ended up with far too much weight).It features top load, front load and bottom load so you can reach any piece of equipment easily at any time. It has water bladder storage. It has two nifty belt pouches for candies or perhaps a digital camera all which are well designed and durable. The top can detach to double as a day pack (although I have yet to see a practical use for this).While looking for a good pack I typed ""Best backpack"" into Google and came across a consumer research page whereby they had gathered information from as many sources as possible on the best backpacks, here is an excerpt taken directly from that site ""Some brands stand out, however - especially Gregory, Osprey and Arc'Teryx. An older survey of through-hikers on the Appalachian Trail by Roland Mueser found that hikers were most satisfied with Gregory backpacks, and it continues to be one of the brands most recommended in backpack reviews.""Apparently the delight with Gregory stems from their durability. They need less repairs and maintenance than other brands. I can't attest to this but again the construction is definitely solid.All in all I'm delighted with this item. We'll see over time how it holds up but at this point I would have no desire to change this for anything else.5 out of 5WARNING: Backpacks come in different sizes which is vital for the fit. Speak with someone who knows about them in a store. This is a science and they know their stuff."

81519,2,"I ordered the Easy Seat and used it for several days. If one is only interested in easing pressure on the nerves and arteries of the perineum, then one can be reasonably satisfied, for the product certainly accomplishes this.Early on however, it became apparent that if one removes one's hands from the handlebars, especially while peddling, it is nearly impossible to balance the bike. Apparently, one needs to apply subtle pressure through the inner thighs to the horn of the saddle in order to maintain balance. Of course, the Easy Seat has no horn. In addition, no matter how tightly I fastened the thumb screws to separate the pads, they would invariably come together. I am convenced that the osillating motion of the pads as one peddles, and the friction this generates, requires more effort from the rider to propel the bike.I have retired the Easy Seat and replaced it with a split saddle which seems to solve the perineal pressure problem. What looked good on paper proved a disappointment in practice."

443328,0,"Approximately 40 years ago, I sold twist boards out of my home. They were first introduced at a Home and Garden Show here in Toledo, Ohio. They were either circular or square with the under carriage showing the ball bearings (i.e., couldn't use either side, only the one). With this twist board I just purchased, the only thing I would suggest is that it should be made larger....at least a couple to three inches larger. I don't have large feet and just am able to fit on the board, but with someone larger, their feet would hang off. Love the board, have used it before, especially to the 50's rock and roll music. Marvelous workout for not only the waistline, but quads get a good workout along with it being a cardio workout. Love the board, but make it larger. Thank you,Pat............."

Another reviewer seems to have it right: hold one side of the frame firmly, then pull the lens sideways so the small 'notch' of the lens comes out first. Playing with the nose piece won't get you anywhere. Otherwise it's actually a nice package, they fit well, the nose piece is adjustable, and the case has separate sleeves for the lenses to keep them from getting scratched up.

494728,0,"The product works fine and has had no functional problems. Installation is identical to almost all other bike computers that work off the rear wheel.The power measurement was a selling point but after using a couple of times I realise it's no different to the speedo when you're on the fluid trainer.The buttons are quite firm and don't knock accidentally but could be a bit easier to use when you're on the move.My main gripe is just that the choice of onscreen data is a bit limited. If I'm on the trainer, seeing Power and Cadence at the same time would be nice, but the display combinations don't seem to work that way. It also takes a bit of manual reading to get things setup ... eg. km/h, celcius, etc.As a plus: it mounts on my head stem just fine."
411627,2,"It is not that bad of an item. It seems to work well and have mutiple types of workouts available. Upon receiving, the pacakge seemed to be in tact. When I opened it, I noticed the bungee holder(part 10 qty 1) was pretty much bronken, rendering it useless. This prrevents me from adding any resistance to the machine. I called the manufacturer, and apparently I need to order the part, even though it was damaged during shipping. For a very cheap peice of plactic it is about 21.00$. After taking a better look at the machine, I noticed a majority of the smaller parts are very, very cheap. I compared the parts that are cheap to the parts pricing list. If you need small replacement parts, you would be better off just buying a whole new machine. I think they had one part of the frame priced at around 300$.I will continue to use this machine, but I will make my own replacement parts :). If a bungee breaks on you, instead of spening 40$ on a replacement, go to a hardware store and buy 3 high quality ones for 25$ that will last twice as long, and give you more resistance.I guess you get what you pay for :)Parts pricing list from their site.[...]"

Operates on a common 9-volt battery. It is exactly as advertised. Slope mode is nice too. It gives you the actual yardage and the yardage you should play the shot to according to the degree of the slope...all on the same screen. You should know that the slope edition is not legal in tournaments. Comes with a nice case with a magnetic latch so removing and putting the unit away between shots is quick and easy. CONS: None.

284735,0,"I was looking for a BPA-free sippy cup. Since there not much option, and one of my friends like this, I give it a try.Honestly, it's okay.My son doesn't like it that much since he has to really suck the milk out from it.My son was 16.5-month when he got this cup. He usually drink thru regular or straw cup when he's at home, or thru sports bottle when he's in daycare. He used his regular nipple bottle before bedtime. And I'm trying to replace his nipple bottle with this KK. Unfortunately, he doesn't like it.I ended up getting him a Born-free sippy cup for his bedtime milk, and uses this strictly outside the house kind of thing. It does leak around the spout sometime (I used Avent soft spout). I think it's mostly because of the pressure, cold & hot air thingy. So, just release the pressure by opening the bottle, and tighten it back. Most of the time, that would do the trick.It has been about a month since we get this bottle, and my son still drink less out of this compared to either born-free bottle or regular cup. But my friend's little girl(2 weeks older than my son) loves this bottle very much. So, it's all depends on your toddler...:)"
436893,0,"The picture here looks great, but when I got them and opened the box I really wasn't impressed.Everything, except the net, seems cheap and home made. The plastic blocks that hold the poles are cheap, molded plastic and the poles themselves are basically PVC with holes drilled in them.The instructions that came with them didn't even match up with the equipment sent, I had to improvise how to string the net to the poles (which didn't even seem like they were meant to be together). And, once I started filling up the blue holding blocks I found that they leaked water excessively, making them unusable after 30 minutes.Unfortunately, I saw very little else out there in terms of options.

To me, its piercing whine screams ""careless design.""Consider using a good quality foot pump such asNRS Bravo 2 Foot Pump(around $36). They never run out of juice, although they're not as fast or easyI don't use the ""deflation feature."" Large-valve mattresses will self deflate in a few minutes.As of late 2010, Coleman shows a new model (#2000000834) at their site, not this older model. The new model is even noisier. (I checked. Wal-Mart has it.)PROs:~~> Fast inflation of ""Boston valve"" type mattresses, such asIntex Downy Twin Bed(see Note 1).~~> You don't have to feed it batteries, like the D-cell version~~> Coleman now sells replacement nozzles at their site.

301980,1,"The questions for this review indicate that someone thinks this product is a toy, and it is not a toy. I am a mechanic, and I build heavy industrial machinery for a living. We just started putting a new style indicator on the machine, and sometimes they get broken. Poly-Zap fixes acrylic and polycarbonate plastics, and if you are careful enough, it will completely fill the seam and become invisible.I could not get the boss to buy it, so I bought it myself. It makes my job faster and easier. I also build models as a hobby, and I use it there, too.I bought this on line because of my local hobby stores, one will not carry it because small people may eat it and become injured, and the other one only sells expired stuff that has turned to jello.I love this stuff for polycarbonate boxes. It will not discolor the clear plexi."
59217,1,"Love this pad, the non-slip grippers on the bottom keep you from sliding around the tent and the soft top keeps the bag in place. Fits great in the included bag and even has a small repair kit. Will buy another for my son when he starts backpacking with me."
462952,2,This is a beautifully made bike but is too small for my 18 month old grandson. His legs are too bent for him to be able to move the bike with his feet. Perhaps you should have different heights available.
412264,0,"1. Where I use this tent primarily- Bishop, California. Have used it in all weather types: 15 degrees with 50 mph winds - 100plus degrees days, no wind.2. Pros- Mesh and light color make it livable in extreme heat.- Two mesh pockets are useful for storing small items.- Length is good (im 6'2).- Sets up and packs down easy (light weight).- side vestibules are useful for storing packs.3. Cons- Horrible during high winds or storms. I had a thin layer of dust over everything on the inside of my tent. During a snow storm I had a thin layer of snow over everything as well. This is because the rain fly is not flush to the ground and the tent itself is mostly mesh. I ended up having to place rocks on the outside of my rain fly to keep the dust/snow from blowing in.- Zipper on rain fly isn't that great. the zipper on the rain fly gets caught frequently. In addition. I can only use one side of the vestibule now because the zipper is destroyed and wont open.4. What I think the tent should be used for- summer and fall. This tent cannot withstand high winds that often accompany winter and spring. The structure stays put, but everything on the inside gets covered by dirt/snow."
277804,1,This case delivers. It's closure is solid and plastic quality stuff not flimsy. Other than that there is nothing else to say.

382550,2,"I sliced my thumb on this chair within 30 sec. of opening it up - on a ragged washer/bolt combo next to the arm. I then noticed several of these combos are crooked, and it was difficult to change the angle of recline. Very shoddy build quality - I would expect this kind of quality on a sub-$20 chair, not one that was well over $50.Finally, I'm not a large fella (5ft 11in), but this chair was made for a much smaller man or for women. I'd say if you're on the lower side of 5ft, it will probably fit you to a tee. Otherwise, steer clear guys - it's way too small.Thanks to Amazon for their return policy - otherwise, I'd be angry with this purchase, rather than just annoyed by the waste of my time and the minor injury."
357910,2,This is crap! It leaks. The black inside part comes right out. I will never buy another mug like this again.
226039,0,"Pros: Heavy duty constructionCons: Very difficult to obtain a tight fit - especially in the heavier models. This means the slippery vinyl sides back and forth on your limbs as you use them.Fix: A steel loop strap would provide for a tight initial fit, which would then be secured by the existing Velcro.Conundrum: If you need HEAVY weights such as these, you likely won't find any alternatives. I couldn't."

132773,2,"I bought these for my husband for sleepware. He finds the material is too heavy and coarse. He, also, doesn't like the waiste band as the rubber lining rubs against his stomach. I don't plan to get him another pair."
244542,0,"I like the tee as it is sturdy. But, I don't like the small imprinted emblem on the sleeve near the cuff as it clashes with some things I want to wear the tee with."
447394,2,"I purchased these padded shorts for an upcoming snowboarding trip. I tried them on and was really disappointed with the lack of tailbone protection, in fact I think the padding would cause more of an injury then without padding because it causes additional pressure. The padding narrows in the tailbone area and easily rides up or over resulting in no protection where you need it. Instead I returned the shorts for the AZZPAD which worked great."
150300,1,Purchased these as a gift for my mother who requested them. She loved them. Has used them for a year or so now and they have held up. Straight out of the box they have a very strong plasticy smell but it wore off. Good solid weights. Recommend!
339482,1,"This is an awesome pedometer. I checked a few local stores prior to purchasing on Amazon. I was not able to find one for this price or quality. I love it! It is dependable and has many functions which I love, such as the 7 day memory and the aerobic stops function. It's well worth the money!"
64160,1,"I bought these shorts for myself because I hate my thighs so it covers them when I work out (I am female). I do like the shorts. They fit well. The problem is not in the making, it's just me. I am not a guy. So therefore, there are certain areas of the shorts that do not fit me correctly. It's the nature of the beast. I recommend them though for their comfort."
270788,1,High quality socks!! Very sturdy and will probably last a long time!! Very comfortable as well.
46986,1,"This pad is a great buy! Not too pricey, but great protection when my little boy is playing ball. It's really durable, too. I definitely recommend it."
487154,2,These are the cheapest new balls ever!! I'm happy I saved money. But you get what you pay for.
242471,2,"This shirt was for my husband and very nice color and looked to be a good quality product. Although the other reviews I read said to order a size larger to be sure it fit I found this to be slightly exaggerated. He wears xl in T shirts, polo shirts and button down shirts and so I ordered the XXL for his swim shirt. When I received it and he tried to put it on he couldn't get the neck opening over his head without stretching it out. When he did get it on it was something akin to a second skin. I'm not sure a XXXL would have fit even if they made that size, which they don't. Probably a good product for skinny adults and kids."
48366,0,"I bought 2 pairs of these for my son's scooters (at $2.97 I almost bought more!) they fit their scooters just fine and are nice & grippy, the only down side being the ends are not particularly strong as I accidentally pushed one of them through when putting it on the bar."
461834,1,"This is an excellent product and I have been very pleased with the results on my leather sofa and leather shoulder bag I use for international travel and business.Attention: regarding Gifted HorseI spend around $5,000 each year via Amazon and continue to love their service, products and customer support. However Gifted Horse (the seller of this product via Amazon) provided poor service. I was guaranteed 2 day delivery (a $6 product with a $6 delivery charge). In fact, it took over two weeks to receive this product and Gifted Horse refused to respond to my two inquiries. I recommend you looking elsewhere for this excellent product."
73418,0,"This rack is pretty well made although I had to interpret the picture to build since there are no step by step instruction. Build is easy though - 5 miuntes. Like some other reviewers I broke some of the plastic bungs that plug the ends of the round sections. Some went in easily, some were actually loose and some hard to be forced and would not go in w/o breaking. The overall product is pretty solid, but it is just too small. Once you have 35 or 45 lb plate on one peg, there is too little clearance to put anything but perhaps a 5 or 10 lbs on the same side. I am using this as an overflow for 35 and 45's I have spare, but if you want to store a full selection of weight, go elsewhere. The other potential concern is that the 'feet' are only as wide as the pegs holding the weights, so stability is not assured when moving larger plates with any imbalnce from one side"
224900,1,"I bought it mostly for my son. The game's a lot of fun. I haven't figured out, how to do a few things yet. I don't have alot of time for it either. Foul shooting with the PS3 is definitly more difficult. I'm an old head though, this game and its tricks are for kids."
261811,2,"I think radio flyer was once called 'the american classic' or something like that. Well I bought two of these for my twins and I can tell you that the parts are poorly made, difficult to assemble properly, and feel very cheap. Spend the extra money and get something more solid than this, these are horrrible!"
84764,0,"I got this to cover for my Omega Seamaster while it was in the watch hospital. After 10 years it needed an overhaul.Plus points, big , rugged, well made, accurate (so far) and seems to be pretty resilient to scratches.I was drawn to the looks of the momentum, and the 2 reviews seemed pretty favorable. So far it's not been quite what I expected, but for unexpected reasons. Here in AZ it gets hot.. and the rubber strap is not really working out too well for me as it's a sweat machine. The strap is also rugged enough to have a life of it's own. It will not let the watch sit squarely on my wrist. This is due to the strap being a bit too stiff. It also makes buckling it up tricky.The other problem is the numerals are shiny, so at some angles you see them and others you don't, so I find myself tipping the thing back and forth to see the time in bright Arizona sun light. As another reviewer pointed out the lens on the date is almost pointless as it works only at a certain angle.My last minus is the luminous markers are a lot less powerful than the ones on the Seamaster.. granted it cost 1600$, but the ""technology"" is old by now, so there is no excuse for not painting it on thick."
439342,0,We have to have these pants for our school uniforms. The pants fit weird. The waist is super small and the length super long and I have very tall children 5 Ft at 9yrs old. and the pants are at least 6 inches to long if I buy the correct waist measurement.
235672,1,"I purchased this Magazine holder several months ago. I have a concealed weapons permit and carry a glock 21 in a Fobus paddle holster with this mag holder. It fits very well, holds the mags securely and is comfortable on the hip. The price is affordable, you don't have to worry about treating leather and it's durable. The paddle type makes it easy to put on and take off. It doesn't come off until you want it to."
20899,0,"well i bought it for my husband for xmas 09 so far good the price compared to store bought was FANTASTIC.He hasnt had it long enough to tell if its gonna give him problems-I am worried something will happen and I need to return it,then what? this is my first amazon purchase."
322926,0,"I was really excited to find an inexpensive, good-looking watch, with an analog face and an alarm. This watch has all of that, and while it is a little thick, that's not the problem. The main bother is the battery life. Either mine was defective, or this watch has an incredibly short battery life. I went through 4 batteries in the space of a year and a half. On the last attempt to replace the battery I accidentally damaged the inside, and broke it. However, if you don't mind taking a risk on the battery I would recommend the watch."
382409,0,"These balls are highs school sized so they run a little smaller than regulation. The leather material corners on the balls I purchased started to peel up which means the adhesive process used to adhere the leather needs to be changed. The balls are super hard but will break in with time. It would be nice if the manufacturer would pre treat the leather to soften them up. With that said, the balls play very well."
63659,0,"This vehicle has been a hit with my seven year-old daughter, wife, and me as well. My daughter is still learning how to fly solo, but shouldn't have any problems after a second training round.The scooter arrived with air in the back tire, and a flat front tire. The front tire goes flat three days after filling, and will have to be replaced. It would have been nice if the front inner-tube was not defective.The drive mechanism is quite noisy at top speed, and sounds a bit like a coffee grinder. I am fearful it will explode into hundreds of tiny pieces some day.Despite the inner-tube problem and drive mechanism noise, I do not regret this purchase, and consider this purchase a good value."
292717,1,"I purchased two pairs of these gloves, one in blue and one in red, and they look fabulous! It's a really welcome change from white, which gets dirty very fast. These gloves are well made, and fit true to size. If you are a golfer, pick your color!"
182313,1,"I was looking for a gold watch with a rotating bezel and reflective hands, and this was the only one I found that looked dainty. It is attractive and feminine, and it is not bulky."
164450,0,All's i needed was a motor and they're about 70 dollars. Motors were out of stock right then and I had to order this overpriced bundle of stuff.My advice is if you need a motor take the time to hunt one down and just order it. Don't wait until the day before your big trip and hot order one of these.
362035,2,This was not all its cracked up to be. Don't get me wrong. It works ok. But not nearly a challenging as it could be. It more a leg work out than abbs. I got this because I had done P90X. Which was the hardest work out program. I was hoping this work have compared to that. The RevX is too easy. It also should have focused more on the core and abbs like it said it would
56279,2,"First of all, the cycle is so light that you have to have it against the wall otherwise it will slide around. This would be no big deal if the stoppers on the end of each pole didn't come off constantly regardless of whether it was against a wall (I have half a mind to hot glue them). Also, the bike doesn't really have any way to increase or decrease the intensity of the pedaling. I think the T-bolt at the top is meant to do that, but it doesn't. Lastly, when you use the cycle for about ten minutes, the metal rods that hold the pedals get scorching hot. There is a warning on it that says (CAUTION - HOT SURFACE) but it seems to me like a major design flaw. Overall, not what I expected, and not worth the money I paid for it."
8005,2,"Size is true, heavyweight material but pills after a couple washes badly. I have always bought Russell brand but never again. I purchased Hanes and am extremely satisfied with all their products."
99384,2,Its an ok bike. Good for maybe short rides definitely not a race bike! It has pretty cheap quality gears break easy
225281,0,"small opening compared to gun vault type safe. large overhangs make it difficult to insert and remove larger items. No key means dead battery needs a 9 volt to reset and start over, so leaving this in a vehicle on hot days would mean no access due to dead battery. There is no security cable, so size wise it is portable but not able to secure it.On the other hand it is cheap and opens ok when set up. has holes in back to mount somewhere,so it could be a fairly fast opening box if the item is reasonably smaller than the inside dimensions"
264888,0,"These shorts are very comfortable, and look great. The only problem with them is that they have NO POCKETS! I am a pocket-horder, so this does not work with me."
332704,0,"This product has worked well enough for me...after learning how to overcome it's design flaws.1. Unlike my previous Planet Bike wired computer, this one does not start automatically.2. I had difficulty getting the computer into it's cradle. The fit was very tight, perhaps intentionally designed this way in response to previous computers popping out during bumpy rides, but this was very tight. Then I had to struggle to get the unit out of the cradle, until it popped out in free flight, and struck the metal trainer my bike was secured to. The little aluminum logo plate at the bottom of the unit popped off, so I decided that I now owned the unit and would not send it back for a refund. Too hard to explain what happened.3. Because the computer was so tight in the cradle, I had to put a lot forward pressure on the unit to move it at all, and then the display would not come on. It took a while to figure out that I had to agressively press forward, putting additional thumb pressure on the bottom/left side of the unit to make the contact on the underside trip the computer to the ""display on"" mode.CONCLUSION: If the alumimum logo plate had not popped off, I probably would have returned this computer. (Again, my wired Planet Bike computer worked so darn well!) Because I could not, I had to discover ""work arounds"" to get the value out of my purchase. Because I felt it would have been complicated to return it, I've learned to live with this computer."
246127,2,"I recently bought the Russell Athletic Long sleeve Shirt in Sam's Club and was very pleased with the shirts. They were a thick cotton ""T"" shirt of very high quality. They did not have the sizes I wanted so I went onto Amazon.com and found the shirts. I ordered the shirts and what I received was a thin (flimsy) cotton shirt of poor quality. For $12.00 you would think you would get a better product considering that in Sam's Club, you can buy the shirts for $7.00. The shirts I received are useless and will be religated to be used as rags. You would not use them when you are painting becaue the paint would come right through the fabric. Do not under any circumstance buy these shirts ."
270602,0,"Easy to assemble, it took my husband less than 15 minutes. He is impressed with the rust resistant hardware, but unimpressed with the crackable plastic frame. The great comfort of the sling and padding is sabotaged by the stupid design of the arm-rest! The arm-rest has a raised 1/2"" wide molded seam running down the center where I think it should be a flat comfortable surface. I also have a problem with the foot-rest sleeve slipping off the frame and I may try to apply some adhesive velcro strips to it."

229383,0,"Before I bring up the issues I had with these shoes, I wanted to stress that they are delightful for wearing around the house. They're flexible and comfortable, and I almost forget that I am wearing them. I wish I could say the same thing about wearing these outside...Every step you make on any rough surface is rather harsh - and I'm not even talking about stepping on rocks or anything ... just concrete itself. It's not so bad if you're not traveling far, but if you are - you really begin to notice the Earth's gravity pummeling your foot down to the ground with each step. It's kind of like being barefoot with just a thin sheet of rubber to protect your feet. My feet got sore long before I got to where I was traveling...it made me realize just how important it is to have shoes with very thick soles, even if you gotta pay 50 dollars or more for them, it's worth the money. They'll last 5 times longer than these, and they won't make your feet sore, or get blisters... (in my case.) I had to take the foot pads out of the inside of an old pair of tennis shoes to make them a little more bearable to walk around in. Considering the discomfort of merely walking on cement - you can forget using these for martial arts, unless you're in a dojo, or basketball court or something. They've gotten torn apart within less than 3 weeks just by walking around and some occasional martial arts practice in soft sand. The soles on the shoes just aren't strong enough. But I can't complain too much. These are some dirt-cheap shoes and they've served me well while they've lasted.Pros -- Extremely affordable- Suitable hybrid between slippers and tennis shoes that are appropriate for use for indoor training or on forgiving terrain. They feel much nicer compared to walking barefoot inside in my opinion.- You can increase the longevity of both the shoes and your feet by using them in sand or perhaps indoors. Otherwise, prepare to damage both very quickly.Cons -- The sizing options were confusing, and caused a bit of hassle to look up online. On top of that I had to order the largest size they had and even that size is snug.- Not durable. I've had these a little less than a month and there's already a hole in one of them. I am shocked they couldn't handle such light abuse for being renowned martial art shoes. I am almost positive they would have been destroyed within days if I trained with these on concrete like I normally do.- Painful. Hurts to step on rocks, or to climb on boulders that aren't smooth. I suggest doing what I did and take the padding out of an old shoe to put in and wear extra thick socks to help alleviate the discomfort.Conclusion -Good deal - the best price I've seen on a pair of shoes...ever..which is the only thing keeping me from giving it 2 stars. I've paid more for beach sandals. The price was too good to be true though...these aren't gonna last long, especially for a martial artist, even if they took precautions with them like I did. Still if you're on a budget..they're better than nothing."
449911,1,"After years of being gently ridiculed by my friends for wearing my old style, high cut shorts that show about 2/3rds of your thigh, I decided it was time to update my fitness wardroble. (That and my old standbys were wearing out.) These are good shorts for the price and they fit well, although I wouldn't mind if they were a little shorter on the leg. I like the mesh fabric they use ... it breathes well, and it should hold fairly well up over time. And I certainly don't stand out in the gym the way some tourists wearing shorts, sandals, and black socks stand out on the beach. At least not anymore. :-) I would have liked these a little better if they had a pocket for holding keys or cell phone, but that's my fault for not reading the description more closely."
20404,0,"If you are used to using a chamois-type product to dry your body you will be fine with this selection. As others state you need to keep the towel moist. Had no problems getting it rolled back up and in the tube provided. Size is adequate. If you are not used to this kind of product to dry your skin you need to know that it rubs the water off, it is not like a cotton towel. But it's easy to pack, use and you don't have to worry about drying it like a towel. I will wait to see what happens when it is stored over the winter in the tube (damp)."

353618,0,"It's a fun game if you play online only AND THE PERSON ONLINE U PLAY AGAINST DOESN'T CHEAT.... which he can do OH SO EASILY. You can play online with anyone else that wants to play online. It would be best to have a friend you know who also has the game. Then you can both play online against each other. Guess what? Online play is FREE! The bad thing is sometimes the server disconnects you after you win and you get a loss. SO ONLY PLAY ONLINE AGAINST YOUR FRIENDS.. BECAUSE PEOPLE ONLINE WILL CHEAT ON YOU ALL THE TIME AND YOU WILL GET LOSSES FOR WINS FOR REASONS YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW... AND THAT WILL SCREW UP YOUR WHOLE DAY..... They DO have rankings online. And you do feel ripped off when you win and don't get credit for it, and on top of that you get a loss. Alley oops are very fun to do, and shooting threes is simple when you choose the best 3 point shooters to shoot with, who are Nash, and probably ray allen.I hated this game at first. I didn't know how to shoot 3's. And my opponents online unfortunaley did. Now I know how. And I can win. Playing in close games online is very fun and competitive. it gives you a rush. So I suggest this game or recommmend it for online gaming purposes."

212131,0,This worked slightly better than a square griddle on my round burners but did not spread the heat as well as I had expected. The parts not directly on thye burner (electric) were not evenly heated although I waited plenty of time for that to happen. The preseasoning does not work that well and was a disappointment. Pancakes still stuck even though I oiled the griddle in addition to the preseasoning.

42269,0,"These BB pellets are sort of the rough, irregular quality pellets one expects in an unexpensive bulk package at this low price. They work OK, but they will effect accuracy and have a very disappointing habit of jamming in some of my air rifles. It seems that the better the air rifle, the more likely they are to jam. The least expensive Chinese air rifle seems to like them the best.So, use accordingly and if you need a better product, try the GAMMO."
280657,1,"I bought this product for my son, and it is of good quality for the price. The leather parts were nice and tight, even though it squeaks a bit, it is not that bad. They say you're supposed to remove the red stings, but when we did this with another shinai he bought, the slats split apart, (and we assume it's because the leather parts were too loose)So we decided to leave them on this one, even though he won't be hitting anyone, nor will he hit anything with it. And even though when he slid the red string up till it was loose, the slats still stayed in place, we still want to keep them in place. So, over all this was a good buy, and the bag is of good quality, too, Even though we had a hard time figuring out how it opens."

However, note that it says on the puma package that it is 'goalkeeper gloves' - but looking at how they are made, these are definitely not good for goalkeeping (but it is understandable for these gloves to be as inflexible if they are to be for goalkeeping.) Also, if you are in cold climate these pairs won't protect you from getting cold."
241239,0,"The material is a little scratchy and lighter weight than I expected, but all in all this is a good product at the price. I will say they don't seem to stretch out of shape as fast as other brands.If you are looking for higher quality (and price) get the Champion version."
367674,2,"I feel really bamboozled by this plastic feeling jacket. Not only was it expensive, I still got wet with this jacket on. To make matters worse, there is not easy way to neatly fold the jacket in the pocket. So when opening it up, you have one wrinkled mess. The outer shell is so thin, that it feels like you are wearing a noisy plastic bag. I would suggest finding cheaper jackets are are more waterproof than this."
257869,0,"I got this band for tennis because it's pretty popular in the tennis community. My only complaint is that when it's on too tight, it feels like it's cutting off my circulation (I have small arms). When I loosen the band, it seems to slide when I sweat or hit overheads. On the plus side, it's easy to adjust."

76265,0,Just does it's job really well in terms of muffling your ears from the gun noise and letting you hear people talk. I love that. Also the other best design factor is that the wire is fitted in the rear rather than on top of your head. Two HUGE pluses!But getting that done is a real pain as it needs batteries and you must solve a puzzle to install them. Instructions are for another model and when taking the parts off needed to install batteries you get scared your gonna brake the darn thing. Once you have the piece off says not to keep batteries stored inside...... Arg....Well this might make me buy a different more well engineered user friendly system later on.
40596,0,"Considering the price, it does its job well. I found it difficult to get on the stock. If I took the optics off my rifle it probably would have gone over the front easily, but I didn't feel like going that route. At the range there was some forward slippage. I already ordered a different cartridge holder that straps on, has a cheek rest, and a pocket for tools. For a few extra dollars, it seems worth it to me. The advantages are this is one super cheap and holds nine rounds."

119916,2,"I got a white, straight cotton version of this tank (no polyblend). The shirt didn't have loads of reviews, but I took a shot at getting one. The cotton is cheap and nasty feeling. Abrasive like paper towel or something, washing didn't make it any better. I will be tossing it aside for extra. I tried wearing it as an undershirt, by the time the day was over I was itching (literally) to get it off ASAP. For $8 per I feel it should have been a little better quality, I will keep shopping around."
439774,1,"these gloves are so comfortable sometimes i forget i am wearing them. i use them for work and for weight lifting. they are padded on the palm side as well as lightly padded on the backhand side. i work at a door and door hardware shop and the palm side is durable enough to survive lifting doors and hardware every day for over 9 months before finally tearing a hole in the palmside (which should be noted the tear actually occurred near the base of the thumb where there is no leather, so for lifting just plain weights they should last pretty much forever.) not much wrist support in these gloves if you are the type that needs it however, i do believe that harbinger makes a similar one with the wrap around wrist support."

71011,0,"My 5 yr old daughter just about lost her mind when she saw it. She had been using a little scooter with 4"" wheels, and this is all terrain comparatively.Sadly, it did not go without a hitch. The box arrived damaged, with the axial of one of the wheels sticking out the side. The locking washer and metric nut were missing and I had to go to a bicycle shop to find a replacement given that the nut was metric. I had the bicycle shop build it for me ($30) and they said later that they replaced the bearings in the handlebars as the ones that came with it were not very good. When I called Kent, they said they would send a replacement nut and washer, but have not received it 3 weeks later.Again, my daughter loves it, all the kids in the neighborhood want to ride it."

340340,1,"I've had this pedometer for nearly a year and I still love it!!. After trying all different kinds at all different prices, this one is a keeper. The step count is accurate. The aerobic function helps encourage you to take that long walk every day. I've bought several for friends and enjoy competing now that everyone's got a good reliable pedometer. I can keep it in my pants pocket and it still keeps counting. My only gripe is that I keep forgetting and put my phone in there too and it pushes the reset button making me have a tantrum that my husband thinks is hilarious. Finally, a pedometer worth wearing every day."
208079,0,"Very nice product. I was hoping they would be a little bit larger than they actually are. Good fit and very see-thru, which is very sexy."
223194,2,"Don't buy these. Unless you can pick them up for $5, they are just likely to be one of those gotcha buys that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.I bought several pairs of these two years ago. They appeared to be part of a product line that had some excellent hoodies which I had purchased initially. I've regretted these sweatpants ever since and have just ended up hiding them under one of the various and sundry heaps in my closet.The worst thing about these pants is the fabric. It is thin, it is SO thin that I can feel even slight breezes coming through the legs. The fleece on the inside of each leg does nothing to help with this or to give the pants a more luxurious feel. When I put these on, the fabric alone screams, ""Cheap!"" at me.But that's not all. The legs are cut too long in proportion to the waistline. This wouldn't be a problem if the result was just a fashionably baggy appearance. However, in both of my pairs of pants, the elastic in the bottoms is weaker than a 10 yo rubber band. As a result, the bottoms are constantly dragging on the floor and getting in the way of my feet. I finally got the clips that cyclists use for their cuffs. This helps a little but is also unnecessarily inconvenient.Last, I have not found the drawstring to be terribly useful. Rather than ending in two strings that I can securely knot, the drawstring is just one continuous loop that is much more difficult to secure. This is perhaps the most minor of the problems, since I can always just cut the drawstring in half. I've been reluctant to do that, though, because this is often just a recipe for losing the string altogether.Companies often modify their styles in the course of different production runs. Possibly the problems I've noted have been corrected. However, this purchase has left me feeling sufficiently burned that I am not likely to make a return to the scene of the crime to try my luck yet again."
429622,0,"I got this case because I shoot bow in the SCA and in that orgnization we are limited to wood shafted arrows only (and they prefer them took as ""period"" as possible, i.e. non modern). Feathered wood shaft arrows can be a bit expensive so I wanted to protect my investment. I also live in florida where we have the florida state bird (i.e the cockroach) and these little snots just love to chow on natural feathers for some reason. I thought this case would help keep them off my arrows when stored in the garage.These cases are nice and rugged and four latches means they stay closed very well. The latches are also not permanently attached which makes them more rugged and conceivably replaceable if one should happen to break. Inside the case there are several ""standoffs"" that help keep the case from collapsing if something heavy got put on top of it. There are four rubber ""holders"" that keep the arrows separated (looks like that thing used to separate your fingers when applying finger nail polish). The holders are not glued into the case they slide into slots built into the inside of the case (nice, makes em replaceable and interchangeable). It is possible to get 18 arrows into this case but the arrows must be installed fletch to point on the arrow beside it and next to the ""standoffs"" you also have to be sure to rotate the feathers so they are not damaged by the standoff being in their way. Most people shoot around 28"" draw, my friend shoots at around a 30"" draw and the case is wide enough to accommodate arrows that are that long with no problems. It isn't a bad case but an experienced friend of mine told me this case will not keep the roaches out so i guess when I store it I'll need to put duct tape around it or somesuch...haven't really had the case long enough to test the theory that it won't keep the critters out.The case has a hunk of foam inside by the handle, I don't know why they did that unless it was just to give the handle a more solid feel. These are pretty nice cases, it would be better if it had an accessory pocket on the outside or maybe some sort of strap setup to hold your ground arrow/bow holder or your quiver. With free shipping these are not a bad deal, we have two of them that have seen a few months use and they're fine and well made, you just have to get used to knowing how to get the arrows in there. If you shoot flu flu (bird arrows) the huge fletches on there are not going to allow a huge number of arrows in this case...at least not the 18 this case can hold of arrows with normal sized fletches."

212972,2,"I admit I was not using the product as it was intended probably. However, the material was so cheap I could give it a slight tug and it would tear, more similar to paper towel than canvas. The wood stabilizers on each level might been sturdier if there was popsicle sticks in there instead of the balsa wood the manufacturer opted to use. The one bright spot is the sturdy plastic D ring that connects the rack to the hooks, they didn't even break when the rest of the rack quickly detached from the hooks. Unless you have 36 or so pairs of flip flops or slippers DO NOT BUY! If you are a sneakerhead DO NOT BUY! If you are a big-footed woman DO NOT BUY! If you have the money to buy something nicer I suggest you keep on looking. Don't waste your time with this thing."

Having made plenty of ice cream in other, more practical but less fun, ice cream makers I realize that this is strictly a novelty.

275349,1,"Texsport Kingwood 3-Room Family TentWe were looking for a larger tent that wasn't going to cost us too much money as we only camp 2 or 3 times a year. The Texsport, though rated as a 3 room tent, really only comfortably sleeps 4 people with two queen air mattresses inside. This setup also gives you room to keep your gear. The zippered room dividers were worthless and ended up in the trash. Its a nice high tent, easy to setup, and has a screened in top from end to end. This is great for star gazing. The rainfly goes on quickly, and also closes up the top so you keep a little warmth inside. We looked all over for a reasonably priced tent, and this fit the bill perfectly. You are not going to find another quality tent like this for this price - believe me, we looked for months!The Pros: Very large tent (18' x 10'), easy to setup/teardown, included rainfly, meshed top on 3/4 of the entire tent, good zippers, 3 points of entry.The Cons: Stakes need to be swapped out with better, heavier duty ones, 3 Room description is misleading"
22623,0,"this is a quality light that covers a decent area and is visible to cars. i use it in only an urban setting, so i can't comment on how it works in a really dark application. one serious flaw is that the mounting strap is really fat and will not close down on just any bike. i have an old fire mountain and this thing will NOT stay tight. any time i hit a bump, drop off a curb, etc, the light spins up off the road and right into my face. it's probably pretty funny looking to everyone sitting in traffic, but it's starting to get old. i even tried tampering with the hardware (it's just a #10 mech. screw), but haven't had any luck. i will update this review if i figure something out, but i doubt there's anything i can do."

188424,0,"I bought these after reading several other reviews from different sites. I returned them the next day. They are simply not worth the money. Go to Home Depot and buy a nice $20 pair of work gloves (and add a very thin, useless layer of insulation) and you have the same thing.Also I read that these gloves run small in their sizing. I bought an XL (which I normally wear) and they were quite a bit too large for my hands. Since they are work gloves, they need to be on the tighter side to be useful. There is too much slack in the palm and the fingers are too long. I've read a lot of good things about these gloves, and maybe the size large would work better, but I was not impressed for a rather high price tag."
335108,1,The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. The set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). The manual is well written and thorough. The cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate.

I went to a bicycle shop and was told the bolts provided to attach it to the bike are very large and not standard for any of the bikes he'd seen. After reading reviews, other people have also had this issue. It would be very nice of BELL to provide a list of bicycle types that would fit this carrier, instead of the ""fits most bikes"" nonsense.

I wanted to learn how to box and become more fit so I purchased the rope for speed training - and it performed adequately. The rope was light, fast and made of a sleek-looking plastic material so it was easy to use. My only problem with this rope is that it recently snapped at the handle as a result of the plastic rope in the handle breaking off due to rotational wear and tear. In short, you get what you pay for. The rope lasted me for about five months and now I'm looking again for a durable speed rope."

100629,1,"The large Topeak Areo Wedge Pack with Velcro is a larger version ofTopeak Aero Wedge Pack with Velcro (Medium). You can go there for the original review. However, since I have both, and they are essentially similar except for capacity, I copied and pasted my original Medium review below for your convenience. Everything I said there applies here as well. I threw in some comments that are Large specific in CAPITALIZED IN [BRACKETS].Ok. It's a wedge. It doesn't really have to do much except hold a few things and fit under the saddle. My requirements were:1.) Well made--check.The construction of the Topeak Aero Wedge is solid. Quality fabric on the upper portion; the lower portion (lighter in color in the pic) has a plastic-like shell (to help repel water and dirt). The quick release buckles (for the straps that attach it to the saddle rails) are (relatively) beefy for what they have to do. The pack has some reinforcements so that it holds its shape regardless of whether you have it empty or full. Also, when attached to my saddle, the Topeak Aero Wedge does not rattle or move around too much while I ride.2.) Holds my stuff--check.I needed a seat wedge to hold 3 things for my ride--my wallet and cash, my (large) cellphone (Cingular 8125), and my keys. The medium Topeak Aero Wedge does so with room to spare--AND that's without having expanded the thing. I can easily stuff a small toolkit, tube or a wrench or two in there as well if I expand it. If you're stuck for space, there are a few elastic loops on the bottom which are designed to hold a small hand/CO2 pump. [THE LARGE SEEMS TO HOLD ABOUT DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT THE MEDIUM HOLDS]3.) Safety features--check.My final requirement was that the wedge has some basic safety features. The Topeak Aero Wedge has a reflective strip across the rear of the pack as well as a loop on the lower portion of the rear to clip a reflector or a light to it. I don't understand why so many seat packs out there do not feature this.Some other features: The interior has a couple of elastic loops across the top, useful for holding a tool kit or a tube separate from your other stuff. The opening flap has a small mesh pocket that you can use to hold money or your keys. The opening flap is also gusseted (small flaps on either side that go up approximately halfway), so that you can open it while it's attached to the bike and stuff won't fall out to one side or the other.Finally, I chose the ""strap-on"" version versus the ""clip-on"" version (Areo Wedge Pack with fixer) because 1.) I feel that the straps allow the pack to ride ""higher"" and ""tighter"" into the saddle, and 2.) the quick release tab on the clip-on version seems thin and flimsy and might break off. I don't know if it's replaceable on the clip-on version. [THE LARGE IS QUITE LARGE AND DOES NOT RIDE AS ""HIGH"" AS THE MEDIUM.]Regards."

It is unorganized... everybody is doing something different and it throws me completely off. The camera does not stay on one exerciser long enough to focus and learn the move. Usually when a workout has different fitness levels they stay focused on the group so you can follow your level... but this just skips all over the place. It's like a really bad gym class. No one keeps count... there is no cadence, and the music... totally uninspiring. I gave it three stars because hopefully it will get better.

26833,0,"I got this watch a few years ago, and I loved it. It is very easy to use, and has many fantastic options. When it comes to a heart rate monitor, this is wonderful. It tests you, and gives you your own heart rate zones, shows you how many calories you burn in a workout, and even gives you a graph that plots your heart rate throughout your workout.The downfall of this watch comes when you wear it on a daily basis. After wearing the watch for about 9 months, I noticed that the rubber/plastic that most of the watch is made of, started to pull away from the face of the watch. After a few more months, there was a huge gap between the face of the watch and the surrounding area. Finally, I went swimming one day, and when I got in the water, the watch died. (It's supposed to be water-proof up to 50m.)So, like I said, if you are looking for a watch that is primarily a heart monitor, this is very nice, but not for everyday use."

44853,1,"Be aware that the large blade is - for some inexplicably stupid reason - ""steak knife serrated"" - except for the last inch or so (which is straight).Re-sharpening this blade will take a bit of work, and the lack of a non-serrated blade is a significant drawback.Also, the tip is rounded off and dull, the blade is clearly only intended for use slicing.This isn't clear on the first Amazon picture (it looks like a straight blade with a normal tip). To make things more confusing, the Swiss Army website shows this as a non serrated knife (what I thought I was buying) - there are apparantly multiple versions of the same knife floating around.One handed opening is rather awkward and slow (a Leatherman Wave is much faster). It is also very difficult / dangerous to close one handed, but I think this applies to all the locking SAKsQuality is great, fit is perfect, the knife is fairly light, blade locks well, but you'll probably want to go for something a bit better.The ""Outrider"" edition is currently only $3 more and is, in my mind, a far superior knife. A little bigger, but it even includes scissors (which this lacks)The ""Locksmith"" is also only a few dollars more and comes with a file."
95639,1,"I love this watch! I get compliments on it all the time. I've found the time to be accurate for a mechanical watch; automatics are never as good as quartz but I'm very happy with this one. This watch looks good in the office, on the beach, or in between. One thing is the compass bezel is pretty much uselss for a couple of reasons: 1. you have to use the Sun to line it up but if you know the time and where the sun is, you already know the direction you're headed. 2. The crown that controls the compass does not lock so the bezel turns by itself as it rubs against my arm. To me this is not a big deal since I don't use the compass feature. All in all, this watch is worth the money. I've wanted an automatic watch for a while and dream of someday getting an Omega Speedmaster or Seamaster so I can fulfill my James Bond dreams. Meanwhile, in reality, I'll stick with the Seiko and save $1800."

179606,1,My husband said the club does what it's suppose to. He gets the distanceand a nice hit to the ball...
367452,0,"I wanted to find out more about balance balls in general, and I have enjoyed this kit. The balance ball is just right for me size-wise. It's a medium, which is suppose to be too big for me because I'm only 5'2""; but it's just right. Taller people should select the larger ball.The ball itself is sturdy and made from good material although I'm sensitive to smells and the plastic/rubber smell at first was too much. The smell does dissipate once the ball is in the air. There was also a cheap blow up mechanism for the ball, but we managed to get the ball inflated after a few struggles.There's an introductory DVD that I've played a few times, and it has helped me to learn the basics and actually get some exercise.I would recommend this kit to someone who is interested in adding the balance ball to their exercise regime."
30177,1,It makes very good Ice. It is easy to care for. Any one can use it. Very easy to install.
208549,0,"Very nice product. I was hoping they would be a little bit larger than they actually are. Good fit and very see-thru, which is very sexy."
250679,0,I bought this ball to make a paper mache halloween costume. It has held up so far but needs to be re-aired a bit every week. For the low price it has done the trick. As a sidenote it takes up more room than expected in my small apartment so you might consider storage; my dog is terrified of its size which provides more entertainment than the ball itself but overall a good buy.
259473,0,The cloth itself is very good quality but I was disappointed that I have to manually push it back inside after each use.I've then found and purchasedCarson Optical super-soft microfiber lens cloth for all Lenses and Eye Glasseswhich has the same idea with an exception that cloth can be drawn inside by drawstring.
275608,2,First time I used the complete set and the bottoms ripped out at the crotch terrible product nt worth the money
227652,1,"First off these things are soft as hell on the inside and it feels great wearing them. Downside, I am 6 foot tall 190 lbs with a 31 inch waist. I ordered the 32x32 and the problem is that I had to cut off the adjustment hardware all together just to make them fit. They were riding a little high on the boys if you know what I mean. With the adjustment things removed they work just fine for me. I would say order a 34x34 or 34x32 but then they are going to be a bit long and it might not add any extra strap length. So tall lean muscular guys or gals? Be repaired to do some minor modifications. I bought these as a joke, since I am from Alabama and everyone out west thinks this is what everyone back home wears. Now I am in love though and I wear them often."
497108,0,"My son was astounded with the size and he and friends had an amazing amount of fun with the ball.If you see the reviews for the 51"" ball, most complained of two things. One: it fell apart quickly. Well, my son went way beyond the care recommendations with two or three 11 year olds in it at once, launching into it from a small trampoline, climbing and jumping on it, etc. It finally developed a small tear near a seam (from leaping onto it). I rather expected it. I've ordered some SeamSeal --- hoping it'll work as I know it's very difficult to repair near seams. Anyway, I'd call it pretty darn tough and suggest that no one expect a blow-up toy to last forever.Two: it takes a long time to fill. Well, for this one, we learned that one person can use two foot pumps at one time --- amazing skill and coordination development. In addition we used a rechargeable electric pump but it only filled one chamber at a time and took too long to recharge. We purchased one that would work while plugged in and that's the best choice by far (well, two or three of these), but of course you couldn't use that in a park. (I couldn't find one that would both hold charge and work with cord.) Remember to add the expense of electric pumpinto your budget (about $35). Entirely pumping with only foot pumps would be a much more phenomenal feat. Anyway, with all of these efforts, and with one or two people working on it at any given time, with one to three pumps at a time, it took about 5 or more interrupted hours to fill, including exhaustion and silliness time, minus the trip to the store.Again, my ball-loving-boy was totally thrilled with it. Then I realized there was no way we'd get it through the door or into the car, even half deflated, and there'd be no way we could get extension cords to a park and have time to both inflate and play (and deflate again). We have maybe 20 feet of rolling space for it in the house luckily, and that's been enough. We've gotten used to squeezing around it as we move around the house. I think I might try pulling it through the double doors, tossing over the wall onto my car, tying it down through the openings, and driving with incredible conspicuousness to a nearby park, (and expecting it'd be burst enough to get home more easily).We don't regret the purchase. Compared to the amount of time spent playing with other toys, it was worth the cost --- oh but we paid a lot less than I see listed here today although I thought we found it through an Amazon associated store. For $100 I got what I expected and a very happy boy. For $180 (don't forget shipping 35 pounds)... well, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place, so I can't say."
57460,0,"I bought the Leatherman Surge with the bit kit; bit extension, and pocket clip with optimism, and while it has a lot of sturdy function, it came with some disappointments. Overall, you can tell that the Surge was outsourced; quality control (China, Taiwan and Mexico) - yes, the various items I got, were made all over the place, and the QC sticks out a bit - but not bad; lately, I've been delighted by some of the Chinese and Taiwaneese knives/tools I've gotten. The Surge has some very good things, and some misses.. Bottom line.. If you can get this on sale, or used, you'll feel better. I did, and I'm very glad.. I also would not spend the extra for the bit kits etc.. I was hoping for smaller torx (T4, T5 etc.), but they weren't in there. Too many types of plain ole screw drivers..Love:Big, heavy and more powerful than your usual multitool.Lots of tools.4 locking tool options are available without opening the tool up.Big-boy pliers; which lock up with assuredness.Like:I got mine, along with the bit packs, pocket clip/lanyard ring kit, and bit extension for $63 ($40 off of normal costs).Better holster than advertised and expected, but this comes with a few hits (won't hold many accessories).Liner lock mechanisms on the most dangerous tools - thumbs up.Eyeglass screwdriver's tend to be useful (watches, keyfobs, sunglasses etc.)Removable pocket-clip add-on is cool, but this tool is made for blue-jeans, heavy duty britches only..Neutral:Heavy (as many have suggested), and I expected that; but, it's a lunky, sort-of heavy..If you have small hands, this is a big tool. Gals may find it cumbersome too.Dislike:Tool action is a bit stiff - it will take some time to break it in. I plan to oil it up.Scissors sharp and solid, but they have a very cheap plastic thumb tab.. feels, and looks 2nd, or 3rd rate.Why don't the pliers have the super-tool removable wire-cutter blades??Hate:That I paid $63 for all the Surge/stuff and the tool doesn't really surprise me yet.. (Note: without an Amazon credit card promotion, this would have been $104!!! So, despite getting a good deal, the accessories are over-priced, and the tool has some misses.****The holster, while seemingly good quality, doesn't barely hold anything else (just the knife and the extra blades).Both the serrated knife blade, and the plain edged plain came dull-ish. I will have to touch them up.That one thing of extra bits, and my pocket clip/Lanyard rig will likely have to be stored outside of the case this tool came with.The extra file came in a very cheap vinyl packet.. I expect that to tear up..That, I'll probably have to buy a new holster which will hold the added stuff.Overall: 3.75 stars out of 5This tool could end up being a regret; or it could grow on me.. I'm going to have to use it.. I'm used to collecting and rating pocket knifes of various quality, and I know when something has been well-made. Ok, a multi-tool is a different animal but has some similarities. On first impression, it's just alright. I'm not a blue-collar worker (like I used to be), so, IMO this tool is over-kill for the average person, unless you've got big hands, or you're in the field everyday and might need quick access to a tool which you left in the truck or on the ground. However, the Surge will go on my hip this year and I may update this review after employing it. Until then, gotta keep it real and say that I got a Buck X-tract for a gift, and am going to use it too (instead of sending it back). My older Gerber (1999), will still have it's place in a glove box.."
87570,2,"A fool for the beauty of it, I purchased this Omega just short of a year ago. Thought I would have it for life. It stopped working last month after a day of simple recreational diving (and no, I did not open the helium-release valve). Today I heard from the Omega-listed customer service center that it would cost more than $1000.00 to repair. A 300 meter dive watch that didn't last 30? Please.... What use is a ""warranty"", if it will still cost more than half the original price to repair? Is this the level of customer service you would expect at this price? Not for most people, I would expect. This has nothing to do with the good service at Amazon. This has everything to do with Omega not standing behind their product. What a disappointment!"
50304,0,So the bike is amazingly beautiful... but its all metal so its very heavy for my 3 year old to pedal. He has fun for about 5 minutes before he gets tired. I'm expecting him to start being able to use it more in the coming months as he gets stronger.

54402,0,"This table tennis set is well made and easy to put together. The paddles are sturdy but soft. Playing a game with this set is not really like playing actual table tennis, however. You need to be very close to the other player, as the soft table tennis balls do not bounce much at all. If you are familiar with regular table tennis, you will need to adjust your playing style for this soft version. This may work well on a very short table, but it does not work well on a typical dining room size table.The plus is that since the balls do not bounce like real table tennis balls, you won't be chasing them all over the room. I can see this working well for children without the fine motor skills required to play regular table tennis."
214882,1,"Great tights for running! I run and off-road bike, so these are perfect for me. They are MINIMALIST, meaning that they are no frills, non-padded, non-compression, non-thermal running shorts. They fit like a glove, stay where they need to be and have a single inside pocket for your key or credit card. They are really great if you wear a hydration pack, since there is no bunching like other shorts. However, I do recommend wearing briefs underneath, just in case...you know. Otherwise, these are not for you. Hope this helps!"
254974,2,"Only when you get the board, do you realize how dangerous it can be. The web site description make no clear mention that beginners need pads, knee guards and even a helmet, a warning which is included only with the assembly instructions. We have happily bought Carrom's nok hokey boards and are delighted that Amazon ships these items directly but closer attention should have been made about the the dangers associated with this particular item. Even an experienced athletic member of the family almost fell off badly using the board. It was not even a close call to ship this back asap."
252069,0,"I ordered 3 pairs. One gray, two black. The gray pair is great; soft, good proportions, fits well. The black pairs are comically large, thinner fabric, and not as soft. The black ones go way past my knees (I ordered large and I'm 6'4"" so past my knees is a long way). I'm returning the black pairs (1 star). I would order more gray ones (5 stars) if I knew I would get the ""good"" size instead of the ""comical"" size."
478121,1,"the only problem that I have is that the seconds goes faster than the digital, go figure out. is like 5 seconds ahead every week. funny!! overall, very nice watch"
284621,0,"The watch looks fantastic and the price was reasonable. I love the no wind, no batteries functionality. If only this watch had a backlight it would it would have all the features I need, but who's making watches with backlights today other than Timex?Overall, I'm pleased with the watch with a few caveats:1) it seems to gain 2-3 minutes each week, which is annoying2) the watch band holes are spaced out so that none of them fit me perfectly, so it's a tad more loose fitting than I'd preferI called Invicta about replacing the watch due to the inaccuracy issue and they seemed willing to work with me. They won't cover my initial shipping costs, which I think is bad, though normal business. Why should I be penalized for a faulty product? I shouldn't be.Also, I found it odd that I have to go to great lengths to tell them in a note with my return that I want a replacement, not a repair job. Even then, they wouldn't confirm that I'm definitely getting a replacement. Repairs, I was told, could take 6-8 weeks, which is unreasonable. So, I have to cover one way of the shipping costs AND possibly wait 6-8 weeks for a repair job...not good.If not for the accuracy issue and the return policy issues, I'd list this watch at 4 1/2 stars."

409636,1,"I bought this a couple of month ago, I've been going to the gym for over a year now, and always felt a little uncomfortable with the short I used, I searched for something like this locally but was unable to find anything, or too expensive.This are great for the gym or just hang around the house, extremely light to wear and very fresh as well, the microfiber lets air breeze in just fine. There is no pockets which is fine for the gym, but a little annoying."
131555,2,"The jacket is warm, really smart looking, and sporty. My problem is that the yellow dye got all over what was being washed. Thinking all was ruined and had to be replaced was upsetting. Upon rewashing (minus the Marmot FlashpointJacket) the yellow dye came out. Still my whites and light colored fabrics were left dingy. In this day and age colors to run is usually the unexpected, especially, with a product such as this. As a precaution, wash by hand separately and let it hang dry, you still have to be careful with the &#34;drip dry&#34; in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip. Laying down a light colored towel or bathmat would not be a good idea as these will get discolored.I bought 2 of the identical jackets at Christmas time. One as a gift, and the other for me. Learning ing how these jackets &#34;wash&#34; was a disappointment, however, wearing this jacket does feel exactly as described."
197148,0,"For a first time scooter, it's great. My advice is try to take special, special care of it. My on/off switch broke because I think I turned it off and on too much. So here's a good tip for buyers, don't do that because it wastes a lot of battery power. So, I'm sort of mad about my E-300 but hey, it was good before that happened!"
274379,0,"The push & steering mechanism broke within an hour of use. I've contacted radio flyer customer service, they are backed ordered on this replacement part. It seems to be a common problem. I wish the front wheel was switchable from free-wheeling coaster hub to a normal fixed hub. The coaster hub is great for pushing a child, but bad for normal riding. A child cannot control speed or even stop, which is bad if you live on or near a hill."
362515,0,"I think these socks are fine, but the order from Amazon left something to be desired. On their site, the socks were available only in S, M, and L with no description of corresponding shoe size. I guessed that my wife's size 6 shoe would be a medium. I ordered two pair. As it turns out, each pair got shipped from a different company (neither was Amazon). Only when I got documentation from those companies did I find that the size medium corresponds to a shoe size 7-9.5. Basically, the socks are too big for my wife. This info should have been available on the Amazon order page."
374074,0,"I opened this product and was very surprised at the quality. I started adding attachments and then wanted to test it. It seemed to come with a charge already and when I tried to shoot it nothing happened. I am not sure if all guns are like this but you have to have more than a couple of the ammo in the clip otherwise the spring doesn't load it properly when you shoot. Once I loaded more ammo it shot fine.The problem: the mounted scope on the top is blocked by the iron sites at the end of the gun. This bothers me since it makes the mounted scope useless with these giant iron sights in the way that as far as I can tell you cannot remove them. Everything else rocked, it came with a lot of addons and works great."

Can't ask for more. I have one in .22 that was much harder to pull through the first time, but the 12 gauge one wasn't bad at all. I will keep buying these as I acquire new calibers.They also wash when dirty, just a little bit of soap and some hot water, then let them air dry and you are good to go."
420215,0,"I just got Danskin drawstring cotton knit pants at Walmart that look just like this for $13. There are only a few differences: mine is 84% cotton, 5% spandex and 11% polyester. This means that I can wash it in warm water and dry it on perma press. I also have zippers on my pockets which is nice for my car keys and ipod. I bought two, one in turquoise and the other in black. They are incredibly comfortable, wash, dry and wear, and the drawstring is perfect for getting the comfiest fit. Danskin has its own area in the Walmart stores in the women's clothing section."

These run a little bit small and should have just a bit more length to them. I'm 6'3"" tall and normally an extra large works fine for me, but not in this vest. I would have ordered an extra large Tall, but they don't come in the Tall size.I really like the fleece feel and the two outside zipper pocket, but it would be nice if they had an inside pocket, like Columbia puts on the inside of their Cougar Peaks outerwear."
462430,0,"I already own the ""grid"" foam roller from Trigger Point therapy. I was expecting this product to be substantially firmer. It has the consistency that is just firmer than that of a new tennis ball. It does work well on the front and side of your leg, but has issues with the underside due to it's lower profile than the foam roller. I love their foam roller and highly recommend that along with one or two lacrosse balls (they're cheaper and just as effective as the TP ones) from your local sports store. Unfortunately, since I own the previously mentioned products I find this one somewhat unnecessary."
257458,2,"I purchased a Smooth Fitness CE Elliptical on December 22, 2005. The unit was delivered on January 10, 2006. I paid an extra $100 to have the unit uncrated and set up in my exercise room. The delivery person setting up my unit had never seen an elliptical trainer before and wound up setting it up improperly. After about 30 min. of use the next day, the unit started to make a high pitch squeal. I submitted a service request on January 11, 2006. It took two weeks before someone contacted me. On the day that my elliptical was to be serviced, the service agent never showed up causing me to waste a vacation day. When I called Fitness Contractors to inquire as to what had happened, the woman answering the phone was extremely rude and hung up on me. I was so frustrated by the whole service experience that I eventually returned my Smooth Fitness CE elliptical for a full refund. I plan to purchase a Schwinn 438 elliptical trainer in its place."
257376,1,"This sock is a bit heavy. I wouldn't use it to run or bike in during the summer, but I do like it for hiking. Typically I wear one pair inside out as a liner against the skin and then a second pair right-side-out over that in the summer. In the colder weather I wear one liner inside out and a wool sock of appropriate thickness over the liner (this is all very duh, I know.)This set-up works great for all day hiking. I have been on the trail when the temp hit 106 degrees and my feet were not at all too hot and they were not sweaty, either. The sweat was wicked away and my feet were kept cool. In hot or cold, this sock works great.I've never had an issue with seams, but I always wear the sock layer against my skin inside out unless they are totally seamless and I've never had an issue with any sock's seam.Overall, these are a great sock for certain use and if you don't like sock seams you can try wearing your socks inside out...because it works."
325828,0,"I have a relatively long thumb. I usually wear through my gloves pretty quickly. This ones seems to be holding up a bit better. However, it does not fit as well as many others I've had, particularly around my middle finger. It has been pushing down on my nail the last few times I have played, and that hurts. Also, the grip is white for some strange reason. After one game, the grip was mostly black and my racquet's grip was getting a big lighter."
25789,0,"I purchased these pedal extenders hoping to mitigate the affects of femoral/patellar syndrome on my left knee. I was a bit concerned that the radical (one full inch) extension would do more damage than good. I adjusted my cleat (I use the product on the left pedal only) outward reducing the effective extension to perhaps 5/8 inch - still fairly radical I feel. After about 350 miles I can't say for sure if the product is helping or not. My knee pain (actually more like an aggravating irritation) is still there though it doesn't seem to be getting worse, thus I intend to continue to use the product.These extenders are solid steel - should last just about forever. Delivery was fast and the price was right - less than $20 with shipping."

497491,2,"The box that the knife came packaged in says it is made from stainless steel and not titanium. I am no metal expert so I have no idea what the knife blade is actually made from. If the knife is made out of titanium and the company could not put enough effort into quality control to put the correct metal on the box then I question the entire product. The plastic sheath says titanium on it but I could not find anywhere on the knife itself where it said what metal it was. I returned the knife so I cannot comment on how useful it is or how well it would hold up over time. However, I still feel justified in writing a review since I think purchasers should be made aware that the product they are ordering may not be what they receive.Also, regardless of what metal the knife was made from, it was not securely held in place by the sheath (I ordered the blunt-tip knife). Other reviewers said the sheath worked well but the knife I received was very wobbly in the sheath and could be easily pulled out without having to actuate the side levers meant to hold it in place. I held the sheath upside down and shook it to see if gravity would pull the knife out and it did fall out of the sheath on its own. This might be fine if you were just wearing it on your leg as you walk down to the corner coffee shop, but as any diver can attest, anything not securely attached is going to end up at the bottom of the ocean."

269194,0,"ORIGINAL:The Bosu was purchased from amazon in September 2011 and inflated to the recommended 10"" height. The Bosu was NOT stored in the sunlight and was kept at normal room temperatures. The Bosu was used about 50-75 times as part of exercising with my other equipment.I went to use it last month and the Bosu ball dome was FLAT!!! I added more air and, used it and the next day it was flat again. I did this repeatedly during the last month. Last night, the Bosu didn't even last through ONE exercise session. The Bosu is now useless. A web search shows this is a common issue with this equipment. Many have stated the leak is from the white plug. I checked for air leaks using a soap solution (look for bubbles) and there was NO leaking at the plug.Before you purchase this item, read the reviews and do web searches for air leaks in Bosu balls. I strongly recommend NOT buying this product as it breaks after so little use. (I rated it ""ONE STAR"")2013-Jan Update: The manufacturer replaced the defective ball and was great to deal with. Since I had nothing to lose at this point, I figured I try to repair the original Bosu in case my replacement ever failed - I'd know how!This repair plan worked WELL for me, so I thought I'd share it.Pump the ball up and replace the plug and check for leaks. It is VERY LIKELY the plug is NOT leaking and thus not your problem. If the plug is OK, then proceed below.Take the nuts/bolts out that hold the black base together. Pull the blue Bosu out of the black frame. Pump the BOSU up and put plug back in. Mix dishwashing hand soap about 1 part soap to 3 parts warm water - mix and do not shake - you want a bubble free solution. Pour the diluted soap all over the ball and look for bubbles. Bubbles indicate a leak. When you find a leak, dry that area off and mark it with a permanent marker (ie Sharpie). Examine the whole ball.When you have found all of the leaks, rinse the soap off of the ball and dry with a towel. Deflate the ball until it is soft, but somewhat inflated. For each leak as shown by the Sharpie, wash with 91% rubbing alcohol (do one hole at a time - marker ink my come off). Dry with a paper towel.Put a spot of ""Shoe Goo"" or ""GOOP"" adhesive on the hole. Wet your finger with saliva (yes, gross sounding, but that's about the only liquid that I found works!) and smooth over the Shoe Goo or Goop with your saliva wetted finger. Let it dry overnight. Do this for each hole.Re-assemble the Bosu ball into the black base and inflate to the recommended 10"" height. Bosu ball should now be leak-free! I raised the rating to ""THREE STARS"" since the manufacturer was good to deal with and it looks like the owner can repair the ball at little cost and effort."
235997,0,"I've had to use these running shorts along with my previous pair of too-short shorts. The Champion brand are great for wicking away sweat and keeping a tender body area dry however they are extremely see-through immediately upon putting them on! If I wear my black running shorts over these I get the best of both worlds, but for the price of these shorts I would prefer to only need one bottom that has thick enough fabric to not show off my underwear/skin."
230356,0,I like these leggings but I can't say they're as nice as I hoped. They're thin and I personally like them a little heavier weight. I feel they fit a bit better on the heavier side. I do find that they slide down and I'm forever pulling them up.
255008,0,"I used to weight 260 pounds. Now I weigh 250 pounds. I used this balance board as part of my system for losing weight.My son's adult weight is half mine. My son used this balance board on an almost daily basis for four years, and loved it (at the start of which, he probably weighed 100 pounds). The balance board was in near-new condition after four years of continuous use.When my son went to college, I began to use it. In just four months the thing has been completely destroyed -- the wood is splintered, the grooves are too big, the top slides too much.So I am torn. I love balance boarding. And I even love this balance board, for all the joy it brought my family. However, I just wish the manufacturer had used a slightly more expensive wood, and built a product for larger people.I don't know if they ship it with a recommended user weight (for example, skateboards often clearly say that they are not engineered for people who weigh more than 200 pounds)."

225725,1,"I've had the X-Vest for about 3 weeks now and have been very satisfied with it's quality and performance. I was a bit concerned it wouldn't be large enough since I'm 6' 210lbs and ordered a large, but the vest fits very well. I like the way they've designed the weights to fit in front and back pockets, but would have liked to see a storage case for the weights. It will be a while before I get to the point of using all 40 weights and storing them can be a bit of a hassle.Overall, the vest is comfortable, durable and adjustable to fit. The DVD instructional video that came with it had a few good maintenance pointers, but didn't offer much more than that. I'd recommend this vest for someone serious in training. It's a bit expensive, but most items that are built well these days are going to be expensive."
472873,2,"The tube was definitely not medium resistance. It was more like extra light, beginner level. I got this to use in conjunction with P90X and was definitely bummed about it..as well as P90X which I thought was absurd."
6631,0,"This vest is as advertised but is very small for it's rated size. I had to return the vest as it was just too small and out of stock larger. I would say it is a medium or maybe large at best, certainly not an XL by most standards. Quality seemed fine."
464504,1,"I am a walker, and a part of a Walking Club. We try to do 5,000 to 10,000 steps a day.Unfortunately, MOST INEXPENSIVE PEDOMETERS ARE NOT ACCURATE, including the cheap ones from Sportline; that you see in most stores for $5 or under $10.My friends and I in my club received the 345 pedometer from our Senior Center. It is truly the best. It is accurate!!!As we are walkers, and very often walk to same places, we know how many steps are involved. This pedometer keeps accurate counts.Also, this #345 pedometer on the SPORTLINE site is $23.95, plus tax and shipping. Amazon sells this for about $16 plus tax, with NO shipping.As a bonus, this pedometer counts calories, miles and has a clock. Also, when you flip it up, the numbers reverse so you can read it without taking it off.I had to replace my original one, because I was afraid it would fall on the floor in a public bathroom. So... I laid it on the toliet paper dispenser, and left it there. Hopefully, the person who found it likes it as much as I did.OA"
316834,0,"I buy compression shorts to prevent chafing and these did not do that. Like a lot of shorts I've tried they generally only work for 6-7 miles before the sensitive parts are starting to hurt (of course, the real pain is in the shower.)I assume they don't provide enough support down below and allow too much movement which leads to chafing.They're still good for non running. I can use them for normal trips to the gym etc."
118340,1,"After 20 years of use, my old tent had seen better days, so I started reading reviews and researching tents. I decided to purchase the Eureka! Copper Canyon 1512 tent. I really like this tent. It is very roomy (plenty of space for 4 cots and gear), easy to set up (20 minutes the first time, you need at least 2 people), seems well build and sturdy (haven't experienced any bad weather in it yet), good ventilation (huge windows). I only have two negatives, #1 The floor material seems a little thin for my liking (sure hope it doesn't rip) and #2 I wish Eureka! had used a different color material for the floor (I think the light color material will show the dirt)."

391857,1,"Absolutely Loved the pulse metering of the watch when it worked but she crapped out after 2 months. new batteries to no avail. I sent it back for warranty repair and am still waiting after a week and a half. I liked it for running and for my weight lifting sessions. The pulse alarms are a relenting slave-driver and motivator, It's like a good training partner. I may spring $50 for another."

178378,0,"I need to use a sweatband / head band when I run to keep the sweat out of my face and eyes. Well, I didn't find this headband to work well for me. I am not an excessive sweater but this band did not contain the sweat as other headbands I have used.It appears well-made and doesn't look like it will fall apart easily. So, if you are making a fashion statement and not looking to keep the sweat off your face - this is the headband for you."
156313,0,"I got this chair on the recommendation of a message therapist. I was having horrible problems with my upper back and neck, and she thought that it would help me sit straighter. It does that and my neck and upper back is a thousand time better then when I first got the chair. My problem now is that my butt muscles are sore all the time. This chair causes you to keep your butt muscles tight all day, and after awhile, you just get sore. This chair would be good for a person that only sits a few hours a day. I sit most of the day while working on a computer, and I think it is just too much.It is difficult to control the height and if the ball loses too much air, it hurts your butt even more."
478816,0,I have always loved Russell shirts but my local store doesn't stock them any more. Ordered several online and was a little dissapointed. The fit was the same but not nearly as thick of a cotton as what I used to get. Delivery was quick though.
127576,2,I ordered 3 and one of the three had imperfections in the center of the bow(small dents and voids like might normally be found in wood) . After trimming to proper length I bent the bow for installation and it broke at the imperfection. I did not try to wrap it into a circle it broke well before any excessive bend. The other two worked out fine.I was surprised that they shipped each one in a seperate tube. The packaging was poor since the bows were falling out of the tubes when they arrived.
391405,2,I bought two of these heart rate monitors in early June. One only worked for a month before the receiver wouldn't receive any signal. The other still works when I'm at rest but it's routinely off by 20-40 beats/minute during workouts.For the price of two I could have bought one that might still be working. Is it really worth buying any product if it's going to stop working?
94965,0,"I bought these for our dart party, they are darts and work well.. wasn't looking for something over the board and they worked out just fine"
152963,0,It looks amazing but there are a few things that do not work the way they should. First of all the blade and handle do not fit the sheath so you have to use the slide mechanism to even fit the sheath. Secondly the button mechanism is somewhat less than reliable. When you push the button it has to be ever so perfect if you want it to slide. it looks cool but don't buy for functionality
338471,0,Received item. Found it difficult to set up and I am usually pretty good at this. Must have done it correctly because when I woke up this morning it had automatically cleared steps from yesterday (only a few because I just received it later last evening.

I have nothing bad to say about this product."

324808,1,"Let me preface this review by saying that I did a LOT of research for a grill before I decided on this one. I read every review (good and bad) that I could possibly get my hands on and I had list of ""must-haves"" that I wouldn't waiver on. My needs were as follows: 1. Must travel well (easy set up and pack-up) 2. Can't be too big or too heavy (I'm fairly strong girl, but still a girl ') 3. Easy to clean 4. Have enough space to cook meat for 6-8 people at a time. 5. MUST be able to be versatile enough to accommodate my gourmet cooking style and the tools/accessories that I use for my cooking (various sized pans, woks, double boiler, cedar planks, etc). Well...this grill met all of my must-haves and even some ""nice-to-haves"" that I didn't realize I wanted until I had them. I ordered the RoadTrip from Amazon on a Monday and it was at my door Wednesday morning. The price was better than I saw anywhere else and it was eligible for free shipping. I also ordered the wheeled carry case and 2 extra burner grates (see my other reviews) and they were both money well spent!I used the RoadTrip Grill for the first time when I went on a 3 day camping trip last week. I have to admit that I followed all of the suggestions from the other reviews and also tried to learn from their mistakes. For example, I lined the grill will aluminum foil, always pulled the side trays out, covered the drip pan with foil, checked the burner connection before using it the first time, removed the grill grates while transporting, never cooked on heat higher than medium, and didn't cook with the cover down. I also read the manufacturer's instructions to a ""T"". Maybe this put me at an advantage, but it made for a GREAT experience. For my first time using the grill (and camping, BTW), I didn't go too gourmet, however, I did cook steaks, corn on the cob, baked potatoes, burgers, hot dogs, sausage and peppers, pancakes, eggs, sausage, hash browns, and toast. I found that some of the things that I love the most about this grill is the ability to mix and match the grates. I can grill steaks on one side while using the burner grate with a pan of water on the other side to boil corn. I used both grates together with my beloved $165.00 Pampered Chef double burner griddle for making breakfast (I just covered the handles with aluminum foil, just in case). I also loved the size of the cooking area. I was able to turn my double griddle slightly sideways on one side of the grill while using a 10"" saut&eacute; pan on the other side. That was GREAT!I also have NO complaints about cleanup and this was the part that scared me to death. I knew that if cleanup was going to be a hassle, that I would be less inclined to use the grill again. Well...I am thrilled to say that cleanup was a breeze. Even the grill grates with cooked-on steak particles came clean with little effort. I sprayed both sides of the grates with Pam Grilling Spray before cooking and when I was done cooking (and the grates were still warm) I just poured a few tablespoons of water on the grates to loosen the food particles while I ate. Once I went back to clean, it wiped right off. For the tough stuff (i.e. cooked on burger grease and melted cheese), I used a copper brush and hot soapy water, as other reviewers suggested. Worked like a charm. As far as cleaning the inside, I simply removed the aluminum foil and wiped it Oxy cleaner...no streaks and no greasy residue. I can honestly say that the grill and the grates came home as clean as they were when they first came out of the box.OK...since nothing is perfect, I do have a few slight nags. These items don't weigh heavily enough for me to lower the rating, but they are still worth mentioning. The ignition/starter button worked great, most of the time. There were a couple of times that I had to light the burner to get it going. I also have a slight complaint about how the tray tables slide out when wheeling the grill around. There really should be a latch to keep them in place, but the latch would need to be better than the latch for the grill cover...as that latch comes undone too easily.In closing...I am absolutely thrilled about this grill. Great price, reliable Coleman name, cleans like a breeze, travels well, and the cooking area (and BTU's) far exceed all comparable grills. I can't wait to take it on my next adventure!"

293190,1,Purchased this as a defensive carry knife. The only issue I found was it is easy to bend the clip if the knife is not positioned to allow sitting in a car seat. I changed the clip mount to opposite side carry and the problem was resolved. I bought a second knife as a gift for a good friend. He loved it.
212462,1,"I bought this griddle for my grandmother to replace an old griddle/comal that she's had for at least 30 years before finally cracking down the middle. After learning a lot about the intricicies of cast iron, I realized that she never took care of her products like you're really supposed to, so the griddle only lasted her 30 years instead of a lifetime . . . still a great value! And hey, she's an old Mexican grandma. She was more worried about making sure her 7 kids were fed than she was about making sure her cast iron products looked pretty. Someone go find me a teflon product that will last 4-5 years, much less 30!Anyway, I was visiting her when I ordered the product so I could season it when it arrived. Of course, this line of Lodge products come already pre-seasoned, but I think it's always good to season the cast iron yourself no matter what. After giving it a good wash with a stiff brush and hot water, I dried it and cooked some bacon on it, wiped down the pan, spreading the fat around, and dropped it in the oven for about an hour. I then gave the griddle another wipe-down and let it sit for a while. The result? During the rest of my visit, I cooked eggs, pancakes, steaks, and many other things on the griddle without any of it sticking and using only a minimal amount of oil. My grandma also got the chance to make tortillas on it (the primary use for her previous griddle). Lodge really does make great cast iron cookware and this griddle is evidence for that claim. This griddle will probably last the rest of my lifetime. And for the price, that's an amazing value!"

327638,1,"I'm just finishing up my 5th week of slim in 6. I'm a tiny lady (5'0"") and had about 10-15lbs to lose (you know, that last little bit that just doesn't want to come off). So far, I have shaved off about 6 of those pounds. That doesn't sound like a whole lot, but like I said, I don't have that much to lose and also my body ""looks"" thinner because I'm now toned. Did I mention I'm now the lightest I have been in the past 5 years? :) I have been doing the program anywhere from 4-6 days a week (closer to 6 depending on my schedule) and have coupled it with a diet (nutrisystem plan).I have definitely noticed definition in my body, particularly in my arms. I'd say my legs have been slightly trimmed, but not so dramatically that anyone would notice right away by looking at me. I for sure look better in my clothes and it has left me feeling great! Now, does my body look anything like Debbie Siebers'? Heck no. Do not buy this thinking that in ONLY 6 weeks you're going to have your ""goal"" body. Now by ""goal"" body I'm talking about the body you imagine yourself having every time you scroll through Pinterest posts of flat abs and thighs the size of arms. What this video WILL do is give you a great kickstart to achieving that ""goal"" body.Since I know it's tough to read long reviews, I've done a Pros & Cons List:PROS:-Toning and Definition in my body; Clothes fitting better (awesome sauce)-""Start it Up"" Disc One was just ""difficult"" enough for me to feel like I had to push, but not too much to the point that I'm discouraged from coming back to do it again.-Her stuff is repetitive (this is a PRO to me bc it helps me determine whether or not I'm getting stronger during the workout--Some will see this as a CON)-Not too expensive (not cheap either tho); nice that it comes with resistant bands-Easy to do in small spaces at home (yay, workouts for people in apartments!)-Workout covers a lot of areas of the body and WILL deliver some form of results in a 6 week time period; how much will depend on your discipline tho!-First Workout DVD I have done where I did NOT quit (I have done 10min pilates/P90X/Tracy Anderson & had a personal trainer--I have quit all of them w/little results)-Debbie is a more relatable fitness instructor compared to others; she's encouraging and not too ridiculously perky. I like that the additional 2 people behind her are also not so perfectly sculpted all the time. They have to stop, take breaks, and get water. Wow, they are human? It makes me feel like I'm not a freak for having to stop every 5 minutes.CONS:-2nd DvD ""Ramp it up"" was SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult than the first video. Was not expecting that. Took me a long time to get used to that workout & it ALMOST made me want to quit-She is off on her counts sometimes and the video editing can be bad (Particularly in the 3rd DvD ""Burn it up"")-Her pacing is off which really bothers me. For instance, bicep curls will be faster on one side than they are the other. She also goes SUPER fast in the lunges and squats. I think this is dangerous to your body because ""non-working out"" people like myself are not used to doing a correct form. I have to pause the tape during these sections and do them at my own pace. I recommend doing this until you find yourself to be a super expert at these moves. Nothing is worth hurting your body over!-The arms section in ""Burn it up"" is particularly confusing for me for some reason. It's more difficult to see what she's doing with the band than in the other videos. She keeps moving from one side to another and since she's opposite of me it was harder for me to follow. I found some of the moves to be a bit awkward and weird too.-She is NOT great at explaining correct form. I ended up getting one of those cheapo mirrors that I lay against the wall so I can see whether or not my lunges, plies, etc. are being done correctly (i.e. no knee over the toes and such)-I don't see this video as a ""long-term"" solution to your ""goal"" body. I'm trying to think of what I will do after my 6 weeks are over and all I can think of is ""order new videos?"" I just feel like some others offer a more long-term practice of working out than this video does. However, this is seen as a more of a bootcamp type of video, so maybe it's not supposed to do more than just kickstart your goal to a new figure.I hope this rambling post has helped some of you determine whether this workout is for you. Overall, I DO recommend this product. It has delivered results and I think I got my money's worth. And that's all you can ask for from a product, right? Now, let's get those ""goal"" bodies!! :)"
347569,0,"The 'panoramic vision' is great, but the straps/buckle are really hard to adjust. Several swimming instructors had problems with it. Also, after about a few months of usage for just 1/2 hr a week, water started leaking in. It's as if the silicone wore out. The swimming instructors had to tighten it so much (to get it leak free) that red marks are left on my kid's face. We are switching back to the 'standard' swim goggles."

27567,1,"I was recently in a car accident and injured both my arm and leg. I work out regularly doing step aerobics and weights so I knew I would not be able to do that for a while. I decided to order this product to use while I recovered, and I have to say that I am impressed. The bulge on my belly is disappearing which I have tried for years to tone with sit-ups and in a couple of weeks I noticed a difference. I am now back to doing my aerobic tapes but I skip the end of the video (sit-ups and floor work) and use my igallop for 15 - 30 minutes. It really has made a difference and instead of gaining weight over the weeks I could not work out, I have probably lost 5 pounds and feel happy in a bikini again (without the bulge). Highly recommend and very easy. Beginners can just sit and get a work out whereas more advanced can add movement while on the maching (ie leg lifts, arm work with weights, etc) to make it much more intense."

278855,2,"I bought this pocket saw, thinking it might be a useful addition to my survival kit. I tried it out on a fallen dogwood limb in my yard a few minutes ago. It got halfway though a 1"" section, and bound in the kerf. The saw would not actually make a cut. The saw kept twisting and coiling up. After 5 minutes, it kinked and snapped.I'm glad I tried this thing out before relying on it in an actual survival situation. The life it wouldn't have saved could have been mine. I would be disappointed and angry about the total miserable failure, but I consider items that cost less than $5 to be reasonably disposable.Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this item for any purpose."

503157,1,"I bought these over the clear ones and color tinted ones because they will shade my eyes and not create false colored images, which gives me headaches. They do not magnify or distort.These will fit every head you put them on. They are comfortable, and stay planted well on your face. They are not loose nor snug.Would be ideal for shooters because of the wide shades. You only get 1 pair of eyes.. You don't want to risk it.Also would be ideal for those that use watercraft, they will definately stay on and keep the wind and sun out of your eyes.VERY durable. I could probably shoot a pellet at it with my 1000 fps airgun at 20 yards. I would never shoot at anyone with it, the only way I'd get hit in the eye would be from ricochet. (Much less fps)Great purchase for multiple activities!"
476187,1,"I have to laugh at myself, writing a review for a T-Shirt of all things, but I gotta tell you, this is no ordinary T-shirt! A year ago I bought one of these shirts in a local store and fell completely in love with it. It's now a year later, I love it just the same, and I can't find them anywhere, except Amazon (thank God!) The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it, and after a year of constant use (for work) the silkscreen still looks great. When you compare this shirt to a 100% cotton shirt, these wear MUCH lighter & cooler, even though it says ""heavyweight."" Don't let that scare you as it's not ""heavy"" at all. With constant washing over the last year, the Hanes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster. Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would. Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle. I wish I had known about these shirts years ago... Don't kick yourself years down the road when you buy one of these shirts by accident and wonder where its been all your life (like I did), get it now and enjoy it."

284816,0,"Size is good. No issues there. Just with the fabric used. Do not under any circumstances, get this wet. Just from opening it up after delivery, you can tell that it will go see through with rain or sweat. Fit was good for my bf and he wants more but I think I will try another brand. But for the price it will do for now."
422584,2,"I bought this kit from Academy Sports, and it is poorly merchandised and is generally insufficient. The product I got does not resemble the description at Amazon, so it may be some derivative scheme for Academy Sports. The illustration on the box is also deceptive, in that it does not match the contents.It has 3 long rods that screw into a handle, so you could clean a long gun. But the box is labeled ""Pistol Cleaning Kit"", and I don't know of many pistols with a 30"" barrel. Worse, the tips/ends only screw into the last rod, so you cannot use the handled rod with the ends. As another poster pointed out, there are no brushes, so how can this be called a 'kit'?But, you can clean your .22 rifle with their pistol cleaning kit!This is landfill."

500609,0,"I have been snowshoeing fairly consistently since 1992. I have been using Tubbs Sierras and have tried several other brands such as Sherpa and Atlas. I now live in southern BC where the snow is a lot fluffier so thought it was time for a larger platform. I heard a lot of great things about CM and have been told they are supposed to be the Cadillac of Snowshoes. Unlike Tubbs and Atlas, CMs are still made in the US which made the choice even easier.I will start with the positive. They are amazingly light for the size and the binding system is very easy to use even w/ gloves. It's brilliant. All of the adjustments for tightening and loosening are made so you can easily manipulate it with a gloved or mitted hand.Unfortunately, the second time I used them the heel strap broke. CM said it was because ""some customers overtighten the bindings resulting in broken straps"" so I guess I am not alone. I was on very steep deep snow and it was tough going. I am not one to over tighten something needlessly whether it be a pack, snowshoe, or whatever. The bindings on my old Sierras' are made of thick nylon webbing which is made to be pulled as hard as you are able to, but the CMs are made of a thinner material so I took this into consideration when tightening by trying to put a finger between the binding and my boot etc... The bottom line is I was being careful. Having said that, if I did over tighten, then there must be a fine line between too tight and too loose which shouldn't be that way with back country gear, especailly with something you are adjusting w/ a gloved hand. It made me worry a little if and when they would break again. Hopefully not 5 miles from the car.My main complaint however is the fronts tend to nose down. This helps a little when on steep terrain but on moderate to flat, it's a little frustrating. I felt as if the binding was mounted too far forward. I am about 220 unloaded which is the weight they are made for. I have never felt this with any other snowshoe. Maybe things would even out if I carried more weight but I doubt it.I hope this didn't come across as a rant. The binding strap broke last season so I took a year to write this not wanting to write a knee-jerk review. My wife also has a pair but of a smaller size and she loves them, especially the bindings.For now I will keep using my Tubbs which are starting to tear a little but that's not bad after 16 years."

61034,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed.

257380,0,Comfortable and does the job. The care instructions are not going to happen. Cold wash gentle I can do but air dry no machine drying allowed--no way! This time of the year I go on a lot of short hikes and go through a lot of liners. On long hikes I only take a couple 3 pair so yes they get washed in a stream and air died; but not at home when I can have 5 or even 10 pair to dry. Hope they hold up under machine air fluff.
37095,0,"This was a gift for my 6 year old boy. It works ok, the strip caps are acually very well done since the entire strip is inserted into the rifle and once you've fired the ten shots the tip of the strip emerges from the bottom and you pull it free. I was afraid that they would stick out and feed like a machine gun which would be totally unlike a lever action rifle.The ""working scope"" is just a hollow plastic tube -- no lenses at all. I find this misleading but cheap plastic lenses would probably give you a worse sight picture than an empty tube anyway.The major drawback is that the trigger is FAR too stiff. My boy can't actually fire the gun! He uses both hands to pull the trigger. After experimenting I realized that the trigger is double action... if I press it it both advances the strip cap and drops the hammer (hidden hammer, the one you see on the top of the gun is decorative). This explains the stiff trigger. I am not sure what the lever does -- the trigger pull is the same whether you activate the lever or not. My ""guess"" is that it is also decorative... it is also flimsy and is almost certainly where the rifle will eventually break.Lastly, the caps are not loud at all. That is either a blessing or a curse, depending on your perspective, but in my opinion it is a drawback. The clack sound of firing on an empty chamber is almost as loud as the cap going off. I was hoping for more bang for my buck.But these are my thoughts and the important one is my boys' verdict. After first use he declared this toy to be ""sort of fun, but not a lot of fun"". Keep this in mind if you are buying."
455424,0,"when it works, it's great. However, often times, I start power walking with this thing, and the heart rate is either suspiciously low or at zero. Sometimes, it jumps to zero or a low number during the exercise. I can live with it, but I am disappointed with the quality considering that I just purchased this."
452214,0,these shorts run small and the elastic in the waistband is not very nice quality - kinda stiff and chunky. For athletis shorts to be worn exercising or working in the yard they are acceptable but they look cheap and I wouldn't wear them in public.
1091,1,I have had a New Wave filter to remove chlorine on my shower for 1 year. I just purchased a New Wave replacement cartridge for my 2nd year of use.

271293,1,"This workout is one of the best home workout video's I own (I own a lot since I get bored with them easy). This is a very intense and challenging workouts I have ( I consider myself a veteran. I have worked out daily for the last 7yrs). Although this video is not so great for targeting areas such as the abs, triceps or biceps it far exceeds my other cardio videos. This video hits the legs and gluets to the core (consequently the abs and upper body). The punching portion targets the shoulders, chest and back more so than the triceps and biceps but they are both worked consequently. There is a short abs section but I usually combine this video with an additional ab routine if time permits. This workout will lift, tuck and nip!"
508455,0,loses a couple of minutes a week. Took it to a seiko dealership -- they want more than the watch cost to clean and adjust it.

56667,0,This was purchased for my 13 yr. old son. He found them to be okay. We should have invested a little more for something more substantial. He also found it annoying that the lenses would fog up.
294440,1,"I live in south florida and wanted a boat but didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've been using this for about 8 months now, with a 40 lbs trolling motor. With that setup it goes about 3-4 mph. I've literally gone hundreds (well at least over 100) of miles up and down the inter coastal with this thing and haven't had any problems. Sometimes I'll tie up the two person boat to hold gear and with that setup it holds 4 adults comfortably. I haven't had any leaks except on the seams, which were patched up with sevylor seamseeler. I use a floor and I think the weight of the battery with me sitting on the battery box was the reason for the small leak. Overall very satisfied. The only down side is it has a lot of chambers and is kinda annoying to blow up and deflate since not all the valves are boston valves."
470407,0,When I picked these from the Thor lo information on socks I did not see they were Tennis Crew socks. I had wanted the thick cushion running sock. It was not too clear which thick cushion I was getting as it did not appear there were lots of thick cushion Thor-Lo's available.

286042,2,"The price is not too bad but with the shipping its not really worth it. I bought them and the black one broke and will not cock. I never used it wrong and when it got jammed it broke from inside. And one of the mags were already bad before I even used it. If your just looking for crapy little guns to have an airsoft war in a back yard or something and dont expect them to last more then a couple wars. Go for it. But if your looking for long durable quality, your looking in the wrong place"
504780,1,"I have just returned from a Boy Scout campout. It was the first time I've used this tent and I was very pleased. The instructions said two people were required for set up, but I did it by myself with no problems at all. I'm 5'11 and 220 pounds and I thought it had plenty of room. When we got to the campsite, we discovered that the forcast had changed to high winds and heavy rain. It rained for the next 24 hours. The tent never leaked once! The ventilation was excellent as I had no condensation problems. It froze Saturday night, yet I still had no condensation problems. The two vestibules were great. I only needed one to keep my very muddy boots out of the tent. This tent is billed as a two-person tent, but I wouldn't use it as such barring some kind of emergency situation. It's not really big enough for two grown men, but it was perfect for one. Other things I really liked are the aluminum poles. They seemed well made and very sturdy, yet light. The tent stakes are aluminum but thicker gauge that most Coleman tent stakes. A very nice plus is the stuff sack that the tent stores in. Unlike so many other tents you purchase that require a PhD in Physics to get the tent back in, this tent fits easily back into it's sturdy bag. It even has a zipper to widen the bag some. This came in handy because I always use a ground tarp and was able to keep the tarp in the same bag as the tent.Inside the tent has mesh gear pockets to keep stuff in. It's well designed with velcro closures and even 2 pen pockets. The only flaw I found is that once you have your stuff in it, it would either hang down over your face (not acceptable) or dangle against your feet. It didn't keep me awake or bother me too much, but moving it to the side or corner would have been better.The tent had very good headroom; a couple of inches more than other comperable tents I considered. This makes all the difference when your getting dressed! The tent included a mesh gear loft but I didn't use it. I like the headroom. However, the gear loft is well designed to keep items from falling out if you're so inclined. The vestibule windows were nice to let in the moonlight.Final analysis: great tent for the price. Factory-sealed seams worked with no problem even in very hard rain. I'd recommend this tent.Happy camping!"

I almost cried because I will no longer be able to play with such a fun toy."
44828,1,"The Pioneer deserves its reputation as a classic.Form factor: It's small and light enough to carry comfortably in a pants pocket. Can't say that about my multi-tool.Durability: The blade and tools are sturdy and well made, and the alox handle seems indestructible.The blade: First and foremost, a knife is a blade, not a pliers, screwdriver, or can opener. This blade is sharp, sturdy, and sizable enough to actually do useful work. Try slicing an apple with a cutesy little 1.5"" blade on a mini-multitool.The tools: Just what you need, and nothing you don't. The awl, bottle opener and can opener are well-designed and surprisingly effective. I'm continually amazed at the amount of chores that I can handle with just the four tools on this knife.There are knives that look cooler and have more gee-whiz features. But for day to day utility, the Pioneer is damn near perfect."
463229,1,"We're really please with the Foogo. It kept my daughter's lunch warm, was easy for her to handle and open (she is 6) and was a good size to hold a full meal.

If they made it half the size, or even just 2/3rds the size, I would LOVE to own one."
379811,0,It works and many people love these... but beware that it won't even fit on a smaller scope tube. I ended up returning it and buying a green laser pointer which I'm 100% impressed with. You need to find the special bracket to mount a GLP (from Orion).

475639,0,"Ordered this a little while ago, it showed up very quickly.The grip itself is ok, the square block at the top isn't very ergonomic, and is rather painful if you have a heavy gun.I used it on my AK-47 for an airsoft mil-sim, then used it on my M249 SAW for the next game. Sadly, the bipod portion snapped right off when I went prone to provide cover fire for my squad.All in all, it's not a terrible grip, but for the money, I would go for something else."

268801,0,"This bike was sent to me by a friend as a gift. Before I opened the box, I searched and searched and searched for the frame size, and it was nowhere to be found online, not even at the Mongoose website. So I HAD to open the box to find the model number and then call up to Pacific Bicycle Company, up in Wisconsin, to find out the frame size, which is 18 INCHES. And, since my inseam is around 32"", this bike was too short for me by almost exactly 2"", the length I had to pull the seatpost out further than the maximum recommended length, which is a dangerous thing to do. So, now my friend will probably have to pay for shipping BACK as a return when she didn't have to pay originally (super saver shipping), and she might not even get a full refund since I opened the mongoose box inside to check the manual for the frame size, which it didn't have anyway. So, if you're not so tall and long-legged like me, this bike seems pretty cool. I would've loved to have kept it. It's pretty and to get full suspension for anything under $200 is great."

In the photo, this looks like it is truly orange - and bright! The reality is that it's not. It's a very dingy color, nearly brownish, and it almost looks as though it's gone through mud and then someone attempted to wash it.

There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner. After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together. When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product."

14011,0,"This pedal isnt horrible, but it definitely lacked the amount of gain I was expecting from it. Dont get me wrong, its a nice addition to my pedal board, works great on a clean channel. For the price I paid, I was still happy with it. If you lower the gain and boost the lows and set the highs back a lot, you can get an awesome tubey bass sound, sorta like Hendrix did in his clean songs. Although everyone has their own tastes, dont take my word on this one. Buy and one and give it a try. Its worth it just because it looks cool sitting there in line with the other pedals."
325120,1,"First of all, a long list of ""goods"":1. They are very light and mold well to your head. I have a big nogging and these are some of the few glasses that I forget I'm wearing. Most glasses for me are just too tight. i don't think it's really the size of the glasses, but rather the fact that the frame itself is a somewhat soft plastic that gives without distorting the shape of the glases. Excellent for sports and VERY comfortable.2. Interchange system works well, although I don't use it often. I stick with the dark glasses.3. Lens quality is good. I mostly use the dark lenses, and they block bright sun very well. The wrap around coverage is excellent. Tint is pleasant.4. Have not had them fog. I've even swam with them using the cord retainer, and although they are not exactly goggles, they work okay. Ventilation is good.And a few bads:1. They don't exactly translate well from sports to daywear. I use them as active use only.2. I have this feeling that the lenses tend to scratch easily. I have collected a few scratches, and none of my other glasses in my rotation (mainly Oakleys) have this issue. My oakleys have had more abuse due to being daily wear glasses and being shoved into bags, glove compartments, etc. In general I'd give Oakley the edge. But lately I'm hard pressed to find Oakleys I like stylewise and fitwise.3. Native warranty sucks. I mean, it sounds good on paper, but how good is a warranty if it comes with a $30 warranty fee? What the heck is a warranty fee? You either warranty my product or not. Hence, good bye Native, hello Smith."
5946,0,"Great for storing pistols. Fitting 4 in it is a bit tight, but doable at least if some of them are compact or smaller. The lower pieces of foam is perforated and is perfect for cutting out slots to hold your magazines.As soon as you turn the case vertically though, your guns will clunk to the bottom of the case. The foam pieces simply aren't large enough to hold them securely."
109361,0,"First, I got the one WITHOUT the GPS---I have the watch and the HRM.Second, I mid-40's runner who wants to run sub-20 5k's (which I am pretty much doing).I use the watch to help gauge improvement in my speed (and other) workouts.The look and ease-of-use of the watch is great. The display is large and easy to read even in pretty dim morning light. When using the chronograph, you can choose what data you want to appear in the large center line of the display. This is convenient when running intervals, or in a race. You get three lines of data so you can monitor HRM, lap, and total time all at once.The HRM (which is a strap+plastic band you wear around your chest) works flawlessly and seems to be pretty accurate. I haven't seen any bad data on it in the four months I've owned it.The negatives:The overall functionality of the watch is not as nice as, say, the Timex FLIX. On that watch I could store a week's worth of interval workouts each separately. On this watch you pretty much have to go home and write your workout down every day (unless you pony up for the data collector).Also, the beep is hard to hear when I press the start/stop button while using the chronograph (sometimes I think the beep doesn't play even though the button action takes place). This can be frustrating when doing interval workouts. I have had problems like this with earlier Timex models, but my timex FLIX was flawless in this regard.On the whole I am happy with the watch and if you want a good HRM, this is one."
186419,0,"Pros:-Sturdy frame supports the bike and a 240 lb rider with no problem-No assembly required.-Not as noisy as other reviewers claim, at least with street/touring tires. Knobbies on a mountain bike might be different.-As good as trainers costing 2 to 3 times as much ... butCons:-No real instructions on how to mount the bike to the trainer--useless pictograms. It includes a quick-release skewer, but does not explain what it would be used for. Presumably it is used if your quick-release skewer won't fit in the support cups. (You mount the bike by tightening the cups over the skewer bolt on one side and the quick-release lever on the other).-Resistance is not adjustable on the trainer, but you can use the bike's gears. However, if you are reasonably fit, you may not be satisfied even in the highest gear combination.-It is harder than it seems to fit the bike into the cups, center and secure the rear wheel and adjust the roller. Don't expect to take the bike on and off the trainer regularly. Use this if you are ""in for the season"".-When mounted the rear wheel is a good 3"" higher than normal. Unless you buy or fabricate a front wheel support you will be constantly riding in a less-than-normal position. Also, if your bike is properly fitted, having it 3"" higher makes it very difficult to get on and off. You'll probably find yourself mounting the bike like a horse, using one of the pedals like a stirrup. Or having a small stepstool next to it.Bottom line:Using your existing bike as an indoor trainer sound like a great idea. However, for not much more money than this item you can buy an indoor exercycle. Before you buy move your bike into the room where you are going to use it--you may be amazed at the space a bike and the trainer take. Because of the Cons this item didn't work out for me and I have an exercycle on the way."
474519,0,"I was told Airdyne exersize bikes are the way to go for general areobic fitness and endurance without the impact of running. After using mine, I agree but I feel the assembly quality is lack luster. I've had belt issues from day one, but the manufacturer has been easy to work with to resolve my problems. I have a Polar heart rate monitor, and the bike has a heart rate receiver, but it doesn't seem to be accurate. After a workout the bike computer claims my average heart rate is almost 20bpm higher than my wrist receiver.If you are looking for a fancy machine that can provide various workout patterns, this is not the one. It is a barebones piece of exercise equipment. If you are self-motivated and able to stick to an exercise program, it provides a great workout.Would I purchase an Airdyne again? Yes, but I would probably choose the original based on the belt issues I've had and the low quality worksmanship of my unit."

407724,1,"This is a very nice headlamp and meets my needs for camping and hiking. It was between this and the similarly priced Petzl. I chose the Apex Pro over the Petzl because there are no moving parts (the Petzle uses a diffuser lense that can be moved to cover the main headlamp) and because the buttons on the Princeton were easier to work (especially with gloves on). The Petzle did have a boost feature that the Princeton does not, but overall that was not so important."

I just thought I'd take a moment to let others know that, depending on the seller, the Thera-Band exercise ball you order may or may not arrive with all the parts you need to inflate it. It is probably a good idea to contact the seller prior to purchasing to inquire as to whether it has the following items:1) INSTRUCTIONS - it may or may not come with them.2) POSTER: the product is supposed to come with a Thera-Band Exercise Ball Guide poster.3) A sort of 'MEASURING TAPE' that is supposed to come with the ball. There are no numbers on it; you're expected to wrap it around the ball before it's completely inflated; there are two holes, one at either end of the tape, which are supposed to line up once the ball is inflated to capacity.4) TWO PLUGS5) An ADAPTER to fit onto a bicycle tire pump.

The shape is ideal too, the curve helps the snorkel stay in place under water."
78278,1,"This scope deserves a better rating than the average of the two already posted. So here I go. Since the specs speak for themselves I won't bother repeating them -- Instead I'll just list a couple of my own observations:Pros:The clarity is superb, period. Maybe there's some light sensor out there that can tell the difference between this scope and a 44mm from a more expensive brand, but so help me I can't tell. Light transmission is excellent and at less than half the cost, this thing is a steal.The turrets are crisp and solid without being too tight and *three sizes are included* for both the windage and elevation (yes, 6 total).The BDC reticule is NOT as think as another reviewer makes it out to be. I'd call it average at worst -- the last time I went out with it I got 3 through a dime at 100yds, so yeah - you can see the bulls eye no problem. The BDC is dialed in for use at 18x magnification for the off-the-shelf 30-06 loads I use (for 55grain .223 it's calibrated to be accurate at 20x). Depending on your loads this could change so pick up the ""Spot On"" iPhone app or visit their site to get custom BDC charts.Cons:The tick marks on *one* of the windage turrets that came with my scope are just a HAIR off and don't line up as perfectly with the selection mark as the rest do. It's subtle and nothing to care about, but I was surprised to see the flaw after noticing how well the other included turrets lined up.Also, like all scopes, this one has slight blurring and convergence issues at its highest power. It's plenty usable, but not as bright. Also, the exit pupil shrinks quickly at that magnification so I find myself leaning too far into the scope to compensate - I actually bumped my brow with it shooting 30-06 ... won't do that again. LOL! Running at 19x solves these problems and, honestly, you can hardly tell the magnification difference at 19 vs 20x.Conclusion:After using this on my X-Bolt for 7 months, I'm just as in love with it today as the day I bought it. And at this price, it's a steal."
277818,2,"I bought an expensive bicycle on the Internet. It had very high quality powertrain components and a carbon frame. The bicycle was purchased on eBay from Bottechia - USA. Unfortunately, in order to keep the cost of this assembled bicycle down the vendor used very low quality wheels and tires.These Kenda Koncepts are heavy and BOTH have failed with less than 500 miles. In both cases the sidewall separated - I'm very glad that I inspect my tires regularly as I don't like to think about the possibility of a blowout on a 40 mi./h descent. I'm a firm believer in ""you get what you pay for"". At $13 a pop shouldn't expect much however I had every right to expect a better quality tire on a bicycle costing $1800. Shame on you Kenda and Bottechia - USA. Additionally, my local bike shop mechanic told me that it is impossible to true the Vuelta X RP Pro wheels. Stay away from them also. A wheel starts out as a strip of metal that is formed into a circle and joined. If there is a pronounced overlap at the join point you will have a ""bump"" and it can't be fixed.There is a lesson here about buying a bicycle on the Internet consisting of very high quality powertrain components at a price that seems too good to be true. The components were primarily duraAce and work very well. In the background there are dirt cheap components in order to meet a price point. These Vuelta wheels and Kenda tires are gone now - replaced with a very nice set of dura ace wheels and tubeless tires. It would have been nice not to have to spend over $500 in a wheel and tire upgrade.Finally, my riding is all on the road and the roads that I ride are 95% good quality with a little shake and bake thrown in but nothing that should have caused both tires to fail in such a short period of time.

It is slow but that suits my style as I generate a lot of pace with my strokes.The big drawback with this racket is its remarkably poor spin. I worked hard to generate spin. I can generate heavy top spin strokes with anything but this racket! I guess I will be replacing the rubber very soon.Still, it is rather inexpensive and likely worth the price."
375990,0,"Beware! The showcase pictures led me to believe these goggles were blue, but that's only reflected light. The PVC frame is actually a dark green with a hint of teal.

(I'm putting together a costume that's predominately blue and thought these would enhance it; I bought theseHobart 770096 Welding Oxy-Acetylene - 50mm Eye Cupgoggles a few months ago and will use those again instead.) They also don't lay like normal glasses, wanting instead to roll onto the lenses when they're placed on a flat surface. They're not as easy to see out of as the Hobart goggles either, clear and dark lenses both.For the price, I will probably keep them; the flip feature is nice and there's definite modding potential.

This is a four week program that's supposed to get you in shape in that time.The best thing about the program is that every workout is only 20 minutes. So, if you don't have a lot of time, it will work for you.The bad part about it is that each workout is only done once. So, you never get comfortable with a workout. You do it once and then move on. I struggled with the moves because of this.Other than that, I enjoyed the fast pace of the program. But, I felt that the 20 minutes and the fact that you only did each workout once actually reduced my fitness level. I'm going to give it another shot and redo the program to see if it works out better for me the second time around because I'll know the moves better."

In those shirts the shoulders fit nicely (I'm average weight at 6') but for this size 4 the shoulders are tight. The construction is amazing on this shirt but the there's a lot of material.

317200,1,"I'm currently 6'2"", 175lbs, and have a 33"" waist (I can fluctuate between a 32"" and a 34"" waist depending on my workout, and the time of year). With that said, Under Armour's sizing chart said that a Medium was 30-32"" and a Large was 34-36"" so I obviously decided to go with a size Large. I should've actually went with an XL probably. The waist seems a little too tight for me. I realize they're compression shorts, but the waist still seems too tight (not TOO uncomfortable, but still a bit worrisome).I actually have a similar pair to these that I bought like 8 years ago (that I still wear), and those were an XL too. I just figured they might've tweaked their sizes since then. But yea, I would definitely order a size (or two) BIGGER than what Under Armour says, if you're worried about the waist feeling too tight. Instead of returning my two pair for a new size (since I've already worn them for a workout), I might just try stretching them by leaving them on some sort of 36"" sphere for a day or so. Hopefully after a while, they'll actually stretch to fit a 33"" waist comfortably.Other than the sizing, these are great. Definitely a slick pair of well-compressed underwear. Nice colors for the waist band help too as they will surely show if you decide to go topless. I've always found the quality and materials to be superb for Under Armour products, and these are right on par with my expectations for that. There is also a ventilated version of these that I recommend too."

449041,0,"My husband bought this for me as a birthday gift. It arrived shortly after ordering. The seat is comfortable, as are the hand grips. As I will only use this to ride around our small town, the price is OK for running it into the ground. The decals on the frame were scratched, but this isn't for a fashion show, so I don't mind. The blue is is really pretty.The manual included instructions for 2 different types of bikes, and having never built a bike before, it was confusing. The fenders are the wrong size for the tires; they barely cover the width, and scrape the tires no matter how I adjust them. Part of the back fender was bent over on itself, over the screw, so I had to disassemble the back tire to unscrew and flatten that part.The rear left brake pad kept rubbing on the tire, without the brake on. After fiddling with all the tensions to no avail, I took it to the bike shop guy. He said the frame of the bike was not meant for hand brakes, only for back-pedal brakes. He finally got the tension right by switching the order of the washers on the brake pads, although it is already slipping back to the old tension. It is still a little loose, but both front and the right rear pad are fine, so I just won't speed downhill.I won't order a bike online again. Next time I will invest $50 more and get a nicer one from the local bike shop."
110224,0,"This is a very lightweight folding table that greats for the occasional picnic or beach trip, but don't expect it to handle too much weight.

A all plastic top would be much more durable."
429743,0,I did some research to find a decent good priced inversion chair and decided on this model at Amazon.It came in a box that I knew required assembly. When I opened the box all of the parts had moved and were in a pile. I had to separate everything to ensure all the parts were available. It took over 3 hours to assemble with plenty of frustration. The chair back pleather had separated from being poorly glued. The release handle did not work at first and I got stuck upside down. I made a simple bike type adjustment and it worked fine.While it works great after the minor adjustments I then decided to move it to another room. It will not fit through any door in the house except outside. This is something I had never anticipated until it was too late. I felt like Goober when he assembled the car in the sheriff's station. Due to the actual size of the unit I will be returning it somehow to Amazon or selling on Craig's list. Something to keep in mind if you purchase one.As for the operation it was fine and did make my back feel better. I'm now looking for one that folds up for storage.Lesson learned.

107156,1,"These were purchased for my granddaughter's 10th birthday. Not only does she love having her own clubs, but they are PINK which is totally rad according to her. They are a nice beginning set for a price that couldn't be beat. If golf turns out to be not her thing, the investment is not that huge."
305544,0,"The ball is nice. I've only been using it a couple days, as the pump that comes with it (which is one reason I bought this ball over others that didn't come with a pump) is a cheap little plastic thing that split once, and after I taped it, then broke apart completely. I had to rig up a bicycle pump. Long, tiring process. Buy this ball if you want, fine, but not because it come with a pump. That would be a disappointment."
67289,0,I ordered these a gift for my son-in-law and when I got them I wasn't really happy at how they looked. They looked kind of cheap and the Iowa Hawkeyes labels on the handles don't look like they will stay on very well. Time will tell. Wish they would have been a nicer looking set.
190785,2,"I have owned Michelins in the past, and was never quite satisfied with them. They seem to wear very quickly. In my case, less than 1500 miles. These Speedium 2s are even worse. I have less than 1000 miles on these, and they are already paper thin. When I first put them on..., my bike handled quite a bit differently. Diving into turns, I did not seem so confident with these. The bike felt as it it were drifting. On my first ride, I remember getting off my bike three times to check if I had a flat. These tires are just plain weird."
9069,2,"when i got the gun i was all excited, i took it out of the box and the first thing i noticed was that it smelled like dung (seriously)...so i took it out and shot it a few times it seemed good.the next day I started shooting it again and inoticed that the range had somhow decresed to like 30 ft(no joke).Then after that the orange tip broke off(not a big problem)but than when i shot it againits range had gone down to 25ft. also the ""scope"" is just a tube with plasticcrosshairs. the gun is cheaply made and i would not buy it."

194735,1,"I bought my original MSR Whisperlite International 17 years ago and finally had to replace it not becasue it broke but becasue I let it down. The stove met its end when it was dunked in saltwater unknown to be and sat for two months in the bottom of my cook kit that way. When I pulled it out to use it next it was rusted and corroded beyond repair. I have hiked thousands of miles with this stove and used it when working in the back country to cook on everyday for entire summers. It does what it was built to do well boil water fast it is not great at simmering or slow cooking but you learn to adapt. There is not much that can not be fixed in the field or at home with just the simple tool that comes with it. I have burnt alcohol, diesel, kerosene, fuel oil, white gas, unleaded gas, and even aviation fuel in this stove. If it is liquid and burn I bet you could use it in this stove.The one improvement I would love to see on this stove would be a all Aluminum or Titanium pump as the pump is the weakest link. It is the one part of the stove I have broken more than once.When it came time to buy a new one I did the research and there was no doubt in my mind which stove I was going to buy."
206222,1,"This is one of the more cost-effective Cross-Bar Adaptors I was able to locate. Because it was so inexpensive, I was a little nervous about what the quality would be like. Rest assured that this thing is put together as well or better than models costing two or three times more!I was also a little leery of the hook end and how it would secure to the bike. There is a very strong spring that keeps the ""hook"" engaged to the seat post with no slippage.In summary, you really cannot beat the quality and cost of this product with what is currently available (05/2011)."
338531,1,I would have lost this pedometer more than 100 times if not for the safety cord. Love having the 5 day history and automatic resetting of steps when the day is done. Aerobic step count is a nice feature. Seems to count steps more accurately too. Very happy with this stepper.
253871,1,"I bought these sweatshirts a few weeks ago and I really liked them. The quality is good and there are a wide variety of colors to choose from. The inner lining is fleece so it feels soft and keeps me warm. But they aren't too bulky either. After washing, they did not shrink much. I do recommend these sweatshirts."
10113,1,"This is a wonderful playmat. It looks small and rectangular in the pictures, but is quite big and almost round. I was thinking about buying the sunshine safari one because it looked bigger, but this one, in my opinion, is big enough. It is extremely well-padded and comfortable for my baby, even on our hardwood floors. I bought it for her when she was 6 weeks old- she was not interested in it all- by the time she was 9 weeks old, she started noticing the adorable hanging toys on top of her. She loves it and I can see that the older she gets, the more she will enjoy it. I always wanted a really nice playmat for my kids (I now have 5) and couldn't find a nice enough one. Now I found one and I'm so happy with it! I recommend this as a gift for someone else- it comes packaged nicely and would make an impressive gift, or for your own baby. Enjoy!"
79790,1,"I bought this at a local bike shop for nearly twice as much (want to support the local guys). Good product. Spring holds my stuff well on the way to work, etc. Several bags attach to the track. FYI make sure to follow the mounting directions. Install the flexible arms first."
174261,0,"I bought these binoculars specifically because of the price. I wanted a cheap pair of binoculars I could have around the house if ever a random thing happened and I wanted to see far away.On arrival the first thing I noticed was how tiny they are! If you are familiar with Swiss cake rolls, they look pretty much exactly like that and the same size too. I can fit them entirely in one hand. Not nessesarily a bad thing, just surprisinging.The second unfortunate thing I noticed after playing around with them was that one eyepiece did not work a swell as the other. While viewing objects the left monocular is blurry compared to the right. I turned them over and looked though the same modular with the other eye to make sure it wasn't just my eyes. If I close my right eye the field of view is not clear. However it is fairly unnoticeable when viewing through both eyes. It seems my right eye can compensate for my left eyes bluriness and it's not too bothersome.So for 12 bucks I can deal with the somewhat blurry left monocular. They feel very sturdy in your hands and look well made, minus the very thin cheap string they give you for putting it around your neck."
222116,1,"I was looking for a small table to put next to me while camping. This table is great next to me while sitting by the fire. It is not the biggest table, but it is perfect for 1-2 people. It folds up very small and is really light-weight.A few downfalls is that it is cold to the touch when the temperature drops. Also it is not the most stable table on uneven surfaces. Other than that I would buy it again and am very happy about the price/value."
307462,0,"I would like to begin by stating I've owned numerous pairs of night sights in the past, including Meprolight Tru-Dot sights. These were a massive FAIL in my belief. I ordered the Orange Rear / Green Front Tritium sights and the orange rear was far more dim than I have seen on sights in the past. But that's not the big worry - the green front sight was also dim!Let me say plainly that my Glock 19 with Meprolight Tru-Dot night sights Mfr'd in 2003 were brighter than this set I ordered Mfr'd in 2007, side-by-side. And the night sights (SigLite) on my Sig Sauer SP2022 and Sig Sauer 1911 C3 blew BOTH of the Meprolight sights out of the water. There was no competition whatsoever.Do yourself a favor - if you want a gun with night sights already from the factory that will be brighter than buying aftermarkets like these then buy a SIG with night sights already. At the end of the day you can make your own decision. But I am highly unsatisfied with this purchase."

413704,1,"Let me start out by saying that I have lots, and when I say lots I mean like over 50 fitness dvd's. Of all my dvds, when it comes to abs, I love this dvd and Jennifer Gallardi's standing ab work. Between the two, I love this one the most. It is rare that I purchase a fitness dvd and like it after the first try; they usually have to grow on me. Shaun T's Hip Hop Abs dvds are effective to me because the moves in the dances are designed to isolate the abs while working out the rest of your body as well so it's not one of those situations where you have to do your ab workout separate from your total body workout although this dvd comes with 3 workout sessions and each one progresses so you can incorporate something else if you want. If you are like me and find crunches put a strain on your neck and back then you'd understand why finding a dvd that incorporates ab work without the need to lie flat on the floor means so much to me. You do get on the floor for the last 5 minutes but you don't lay flat and the exercises aren't hard to the point that you'd want to give up or strain your neck and back. If you are an advanced exerciser that has been working out at an advanced level for many many years, you might want to go with Hip Hop Abs 2. This particular version of Hip Hop Abs is for intermediate exercisers although there is a dvd that preps beginners for the workout as well. I love the fact that I work out my entire body while focusing on my abs. Shaun T is funny also so that helps. The background is good, the moves are well choreographed so you can keep up. I am not into all the complicated step aerobic type moves so this worked for me. It all boils down to a preference but I have been doing Shaun T's Hip Hop Abs since I got it which is almost a month, and for the first time, I am seeing results that I didn't see so quickly when doing other ab work. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who wants a good ab workout that will produce results within a reasonable amount of time.The only minor complaint I have which doesn't affect the results of my workout, is the music is not quite as hip hoppy as I thought it would be. The music is more like remastered pop music. For someone who is new to hip-hop this is good because it won't overwhelm you or compete with Shaun T when he is explaining the moves or leading you to the next step. Maybe that is why the music is like that but since I am a hip hop head, I was hoping for more hip hop style music. The dances are sort of hip hoppish so maybe that's how he came up with the name. Either way, I think you will enjoy this dvd. Shaun T is a good instructor and he leads/teaches the moves in a way that left me confident to do the moves when it was time to execute."
495877,1,Called the company and they said they had everything we needed in stock. We had 20 girls in our program and loved the pants. They were as great online as they were in person.
241752,1,"I bought this because I found the accuracy of the standard barrel on the Tippmann 98 didn't quite cut it. Don't get me wrong, the standard barrel works quite well, but I wanted something that hit on target more consistently. After taking it out for a spin, I'm very impressed. Barrel looks great, minimalist (which is nice), and actually balances out the gun nicely. My one gripe is that the logo is upside down once you screw it on all the way. Not sure how they missed that one in QA...I ordered this from here because this barrel goes for $30 more up here in Canada. They don't offer Canadian shipping so I just picked it up at a border KinekPoint along with some other gear I had ordered."
371107,1,YEA !!! I absolutely love this product. Our little one can now be on the boat and we don't have to worry about her undoing her life jacket. She now has more manuverability and is more comfortable. We love the sun protection this product offers. Highly reccomended.
453704,1,"I'm very happy with the performance of my 603. I keep it on high while not sleeping and can feel the draft it creates in the apartment! It certainly moves a lot of air. I keep it on the 2nd lowest mode while I sleep, and although it's on the 2nd lowest mode, it's still so silent on this speed, I have no problem falling asleep. It's wheels are convienent for moving it, it's simplicity in operating and changing filters is very welcome! The little blue light on the corner of the machine, which is the BlueAir symbol, is rather bright at night, so I turn the machine so the light faces the wall. I also have taped a little piece of paper over it, to block the little diode light. But, aside from that very little problem, i'm extremely happy after owning the maching for about 1 month. I've noticed much less dust and even much less smells in the air from polluted air or from cleaning detergents. I would buy it again in a heartbeat!"
118011,0,"I just put the laces on my Merrell Trail Gloves and they fit fine and serve their purpose. I am a lazy person who does not like to tie his shoes, so this product was great for me. When reading the instruction it's mentioned ""step 5"" for running. It tells you to tie knots at the end of the quick release once you reached a desired fit. But when you do this, you prevent the laces from loosening and cant get the shoes off. I disregarded this step and they still work fine while running.I gave it three stars because I recently tried on a pair of Vibram Five Fingers and it had a quick lace system that allowed the excess lace bundle to be Velcroed onto itself so it doesn't flop around while running. He little knot hider smacks your foot a lot and I had to tuck it into the bottom of the laces. I think if this company were going to expand their product line, they could look into something. Like that."
450632,1,I bought this skateboard for my 12 year old grandson and he loves it. He's broken a few discount store boards (even tho he's not heavy at all)so I wanted a little better quality board. He has been very happy with this skateboard.
398226,0,"I made the mistake of not checking the details on this order. The reflector is 3"" round. For you average bicycle this is really big. Also the mounting bracket comes with no hardware to mount the bracket to the frame (where a hole is already drilled out for the old bracket I broke. The product is as advertised. I just didn't pay close attention to the details and only saw a bracket arm similar to the one I broke on my Raleigh mountain bike."
355342,0,"My Husband likes it. The tees are the plastic ones he will not use, though. He likes the towel and the ball markers a lot."
469079,0,This stock is great. I highly recommend it to many Mosin Nagant rifle owners. Just bewary that your rifle may not automatically fit in the stock. It took me 6 Hours to find out why my bullets would not properly fit into the feed into the magazine. Other than that great pricing and very good quality.
42800,0,This drink holder is ok for the price. I bought it to put beer in while I go on evening bike rides. I really have to tighten the base so that it doesn't move. The coozy is nice so that my beer doesn't slosh around and go flat (I hate that). I've bought coffee holders but they are shaped differently and a beer can or bottle just slips through the bottom. This works for the price I paid for it.
157954,1,"Now, I am 12, but don't doubt my model skills. I airbrushed this product it held fine with no melting of the plastic(don't ask why I said melting) it is pretty well built and interior parts are of high detail and fit pretty well. The problems I had with mine, probably just a molding problem with the one I got, was the wood-like pieces, they pushed out the cockpit and did not allow the fuselage pieces to be fit in. The 50 cal front window guns are very fragile and break off easily, recommend not using the front 2 window guns. I gave it 4 star because with decent putty work, you can remove all imperfections. The fuselage is a bit hard to get on tight, but I managed by taping it down while it was drying and it fit perfectly. So that sums up my review of this product, but I wouldn't recommend this to a beginner or someone who can't handle a lot of stress, cause this can get quite irritating. I recommend you go with a tamiya model, but if you really want a american WW2 plane, this is the ultimate!!"
75190,0,"Bought this to replace the original ""no longer glowing"" site on my Hoyt. Tooless only applys when moving the entire sight. Moving the individual pins is a Pain, they require an allen wrench and several sets of small hands. I only use three pins and often shoot ""between"" them. The fiber has little play...sort of like changing a light switch where the electrician left no slack in the wire. I managed to rough it in but I suspect setting the exact distance between the yardage pins will be difficult.You really can't move pins out of the field of view. Once the pins are set, the tooless part should be handy. I also thought the extended fiber would create much brighter pins in low light. Using the included light cleaverly btrightens the pins without distraction but it will be easy to accidently turn the light on. The price is right and shipping was quick. It is a well made sight and was I likely should have done more research and bought something more in tune with my shooting style."
388113,1,"Simply the Best grip of any Football I have ever owned or used. Perfect spirals, great weight. I lost my first one and couldn't find it in stores anywhere, pretty sure they don't make them anymore. Great Product."
79164,0,"Quick and dirty..The light has two modes, steady and blinking (at even intervals)Brightness: You will not see much, if anything, with this light. It is brighter in front of you as you ride with the full moon than using this light. Its main purpose is for others to see you, especially in the blink mode.Design: Very small and easy to attach (something like attaching a watch strap to your handlebar). I never had problems with it falling off or twisting down on me. Make sure you attach it tightly. I ride in all sorts of weather (above and below freezing, rain, snow, sun), mostly on flatter suburban terrain but I do hop a lot of curves. The light is about 1.5 inches long and less than 1 inch in circumference.Other: Sometimes the on/off button is hard to click (you have to hit the spot right). Don't even bother with gloves on. Batteries are easy to replace (just unscrew the head). It's weatherproof thus far - 1.5 yrs (I leave my bike at train station every day, and on my balcony at night, with light always attached). I only replaced batteries once, about 4 months ago, and that was only because I left it on for the whole day at the train station 2-3 times.If your goal is strictly to be seen, this is one of the best bangs for the buck. If you want to see in front of you on dark trails/alleys, I suggest at least a 1-watt LED headlight."

430276,1,"I own a number of Benchmade pocket knives and usually keep them sharp with one of the ceramic V pocket sharpeners. Recently, I bought a used Benchmade knife with an M2 blade. The M2 blade is the hardest steel you can get in a pocket knife and is currently out of production because it is so difficult to work with. The knife I bought had been poorly sharpendd and needed the edge angle changed.I researched different methods on the web and finally found the Lansky YouTube video that shows exactly how to use the product.I am certainly happy with the outcome. The diamond hones are the only thing that could reshape the M2 edge in any reasonable amount of time. They made quick work of the process and I finished it off with the separate extra fine hone that others have recommended.The results were so good that I sharpened two additional knives while I was at it. My left arm is now pretty much bald from testing their ability to shave hair."
257817,0,"Getting my tires to 90psi took quite a bit of work. The pump gets really hardy after 75 psi and requires lots muscle power to get it pass it.

128982,1,"I have been really satisfied with these tights. They are great for cold temps, but as temps go up, they can get way too warm! I wore them last weekend on a long run and had a few problems. The bands around the waist and ankles are fairly snug and have rubber in them to prevent them riding up or slipping around, and I actually got a blister from one of the ankle cuffs. I think wearing socks with a little higher ankle could have prevented the ankle blister, which I will try from now on. Then I got a nickle-sized scrape in the center of my back (looks and feels like rug burn) from the rubber waist band. I think these injuries were attributed to this being an eleven mile run and because it was a little too warm out. But on colder days (below 45 degrees) these tights are perfect! The compression fit feels good and helps with muscle recovery. I don't seem as sore afterwards or have as much knee pain."

52142,0,"For the price I think you can do better. It is lightly (if not cheaply...) constructed. I guess given its diminutive size, I shouldn't expect it to be built like a tank but for the money, I expected it to be a little sturdier. There is side to side blade play and the lock release mechanism feels gritty, even after trying a couple different lubricants on it. I really like how the clip holds the knife deep in your pocket but it pivots on the one screw that holds it. Every time I pull it out of my pocket, the clip is crooked. Not bent, just crooked. I can live without the little safety too. I see lots of guys saying to superglue it so it doesn't engage in your pocket. Honestly, if I thought I had to do that I would probably just look for a different knife.I have to say though, it does have its good points. It is light and you don't even notice you're carrying it. It came reasonably sharp but needs a little work to get a good edge on it. The handle is a shrunk down version of a full size one but it does seem to find a comfortable place in my hand. Not the way it's intended I think, but it works. The blade deploys quickly, which I would expect, but really no quicker than some of my non-assisted opening knives.Lots of guys seem to love this knife but I have to wonder how many of them are just caught up in the hype from a particular Youtube reviewer. It's an ok knife but I own better built ones that cost less yet they open just as quickly and carry just as nicely as this one. I just got a Kershaw Scallion for approximately the same price and it is a much better knife, imho. It is solidly built and has a very useful blade shape. Even though they have blades that are similar in length, the Scallion makes the Flash I feel like a toy.Edit: I have to laugh. I see I'm not the only reviewer that said they wanted to like this knife, lol."
224344,0,"Great material, great colors, great texture...the only problem is they only reach as far down as my belly button.

I was surprised at how flimsy and light weight the whole bench is. It is narrow and doesn't feel as secure as the Olympic-style one I had. It does have a good feature in that it can be folded to get it out of the way, but I've never tried this. I find myself using the other bench for everything and this on only for the Lat bar.If I had known that is how it was, I would have gone with a different option to obtain a Lat bar."

277914,1,"This is a decent AEG, earning 4 stars in my book because of the Jackon bill price-ish. I got mine at shortyusa for twenty mulas. It can hold a decent 75 rounds, which runs out kinda quick. The rate of fire is good, but the gun can be kinda inaccurate, but while jumping around a corner, it can give a nice burst of bullets to quickly eliminate a cat or enemy. If you're a beginner, I'd definetly snag this gun, and use it well. Have a nice day."

Also, I expected it to be slighly longer at the waist, but I guess Stearns wanted to save on material, so I would judge it to be about 3-4"" too short, although it comes with leg straps to eleminate it riding up towards your head. All and all for $65 I think it's way overpriced for was you get, I think!!! Good thing there was free shipping or I wouldn't have bought for that much money !!"

307443,0,"This is my third Timberline tent in about 20 years. Eureka once made these in an Outfitter model that was truly a GREAT tent. It had a heavy duty floor and stress points were re-enforced. You had to seam seal them but they were really tuff. Now they do not make that tent but a cheaper model. It has a flimsy floor bit it is factory seam sealed. Of course the tent desighn is still the same. It is a great desighn that for all but heavy snow conditions in my opinion is the best desighn of any tent. You can leave the fly attached all the time and still set it up. In rain you can open the front and back and unlessit is a blowing gale stay dry and get plenty of air. The footprint is small meaning less groundto clear. This tent now days is okay for the occasional camper, but I sure miss the outfitter model."

360314,1,I love this bed. I have used it 5 times so far & it is very comfortable & easy to inflate. I found it only deflated a little bit overnight-this was with 2 adults over 200lbs. each sleeping on it. Each night we would just reinflate it for literally 5 seconds & we were good to go. We charged the cordless inflator for 24 hours & did not need to re-charge it at all during a 6-day camping trip. I love this bed & would recommend it to everyone.
221239,1,You cant beat walking up to your tent and hitting the remote to turn on the lights before you even get in! It works great! I like the fact that when I'm in bed I dont need to get up to turn on the light as well. Yes I'm lazy! Great product!
454752,2,"After using it successfully for two weeks, the pulse reading was suddenly either zero or so high I should have gone to the ER. A call to the manufacturer was a total waste of time and a new battery didn't solve the problem.

79863,1,"I love this rack it saved me from carrying my textbooks in my backpack. I have had it for a year now. Mounting it on my bike was easy but I did have to bend the silver attachments and wasn't able to screw one of the sides in all the way because of that so I gave it 4 stars for that. I use my bike in the rain and haven't been keeping up with the cleaning so the rack has rust around the screws. It does support a lot of weight, I have had about 20 big textbooks at one time on it. I like it and recommend it to someone looking for a bike rack."
331093,1,I hate the humidity. A friend of mine suggested I try this shirt. I wear it to the gym and walking around the city when the humidity is unbearable. It leaves me feeling great. I wish I would have discovered this product years ago. It also is simple looking enough it looks great with cargo shorts or what ever you feel like wearing with it.
43175,0,"So far the watch has behaved OK apart from stopping twice over a fortnight due to &#34;running out of wind&#34;. The manual does not state the reserve &#34;spring&#34; time of the watch so I am learning by trial and error. It appears to be about 10 to 12 hours which is barely adequate. I previously owned a self-winding watch which never stopped once apart from when it was stored for some considerable time.This Invicta is a beautifully designed and made watch fully living up to my expectations in these areas.Steel bracelet adjustment was straight forward and only took a few moments only at a local watchmaker who removed few links and adjusted the size easliy.Invicta's only service agent listed is based in the USA which is useless when living in the antipodes, come on Invicta get real on this.The watch manual is a slick printed booklet but is generic across a large range of watches so lacks specific detailed information for each; is too general, omitting such things as &#34;spring reserve time&#34;and shock resistance. What information that is there is lost amongst information about other watches; you can't see the wood for the trees!TM"
198166,0,"I bought this backpack to go to work, because my Jansport was too big and I wanted something smaller. In spite of its small size, it's quite spacious: all of my things, including newspapaper, fit. In terms of weight, it can hold a small thermos of tea and a couple of books. However, this backpack is only good for good weather: it is not waterproof, and in the rain the inside gets wet. I found that to be the only downside of this backpack; the price was great; I've had it for a few months now. I discovered that similar small backpack Northface Pandora is not waterproof either; that one cost $40 and got torn within weeks (and I wasn't trekking with it, just took subway to school)."
395365,1,"This may or may not have been the seller. But there is a part of me that is pretty sure it was. The rod came to me in a box that had been taped together. At first I thought the post office did it, but the tape used to 'repair' the box was the same tape that was originally used for shipping. The pole arrived broken and two rings werent bent severely. Fortunately - Amazon took care of replacement relatively quickly. But I would definitely advise opening up your box from them IMMEDIATELY to see if it's in good shape. The pole is definitely killer for the price. It's not the best pole I have, but for the money I wouldn't be able to get better."

70733,1,Very satisfied. The extra wide angle is perfect for football. The binoculars provide a bright and sharp image. Terrific value for the money.
27514,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
227236,1,"This life vest worked perfectly for my 53 pound grandson. Fit like a glove!!!! Since he was on the lower end of the weight range and it worked so well, I don't think this would fit anyone too much bigger."
351690,0,"I have purchased two of these items, on for my bike and another for my wife's. They function well and have met all of my needs with one exception. The wired Cadence sensor has never worked. I installed two of them and then had the bike shop take it off and reinstall. I even sent them back to Blackburn to get replacement, had the bike shop install the new ones and still, the cadence does not work. It does everything else so well however that I still kept the units."
326664,0,"Good components. This bike took a good beating going downhill. Great, solid bike for many. However, I had to resell. The weight (45lbs) took the fun out of it for me, and I had problems going uphill.Minor mechanical issues w/derailer, but it's probably my fault as I didn't have a clue with respect to maintenance."
362527,1,"I was very excited when I found this product. It can be placed right in the middle of the rear windshield and not obstruct your view. It is dark on the inner side with perforations. It's a great idea! Unfortunately, there are no dimensions in this product's description. I did a live chat with customer support BEFORE I ordered and I was told the actual sticker size was 15""x20"". When I received it,however, it was only 7""x11.5"". I kept it because I still loved it and have not found one anywhere else. It is placed on the outside of the window and the packaging says it can be used with defrost strips and windshield wipers. We will see! Just be careful while placing it. It is pretty sticky and if you go to lift it up to adjust it, it could rip because of the perforations. Looks great! GO BLUE!!"
176770,0,"After a few weeks of having this knife on me, I noticed one of the wooden handle-grips coming unglued. I managed to find the original box it came in to return it, and noticed the sticker that I hadn't seen before. ""Made in China.""I went with Buck specifically because the product was listed as being ""Made in USA."" It's otherwise an OK knife, but it seems like the cheap labor is just that. Buyer beware."
333278,0,"If you need a spacious backpack, for camping or lugging lotsa clothes (traveling), its fine. I wanted a cute bag, but it turned out to be too large. Shoulda been more pragmatic. But a decent bag, none the less."
152511,0,"We never used this, we returned it. Not because it was faulty, but because we wanted to use it in our tent. Big bold disclosure, in 3 places saying not to be used in a tent or confined space, and we didn't want to heat the great outdoors..."

442336,2,This gun is a VERY BAD GUN!!!!! If you are from the ages of 6-10 i would get it but if not dont. I got 2 of these the first 1 broke rit away and the other only shoots 15 feet. trust me this gun is a piece of junk. Just poket to shipping and buy something else!!!
385897,2,Recevied flag. It is all GREEN. No brown on the football. Very disappointed. The brown football looks awesome in the pic.
312488,2,"Product is exact replacement nothing bad on the manufactuer Attwood.After purchasing this item the receipt email said estimated delivery time 3-5 business days. Well 5 days later I get an email telling me that my order was being processed and will ship in 3-5 days. I emailed the company with complaints and never got any response. I even explained in my email for them to contact me, again no response.Needless to say 10 days after placing my order the bow eyes showed up in my mail box, that is 5-7 days late. I will never order from this person again and will suggest if you need anything quickly not to do so."
118379,0,"Overall good quality fit feel and finish , but much looser than I had expected. I would probably choose a more athletic fit if I were to purchase again ."
206489,0,Great for layering due to its thinness. I was expecting this to have a little more substance being a Marmot product. Overall you get what you pay for.
8268,1,"I have tried and used six different mirrors over the past five years and this one beats the lot hands down. It allows a wonderful view of the back and Is large enough to catch the eye instantly even when not looking directly into the mirror...you can still see motion. I now have one of these on my hybrid and one on my road bike. Installation (if you follow the directions, something I do not do too often, alas) is a snap. We have a horrid problem with ""Dukes of Hazard"" types (brain dead A.H.s) around where I live and this thing has literally been a life saver several times. I also travel over some pretty rough roads and the vibration on this one is almost nil. You cannot beat the price they are offering here. I paid much more for mine at a local bike store."
94017,1,"I bought this for my kids christmas gift. They are 3, 5 and 8. I put it together a few days before the 25th after reading reviews that others had difficulty putting it together. My husband assembled it in an hour with no problems at all. The directions were clear to us. When I bought this I did not know it also had music and games to play. My kids like doing the ""freeze"" game they stop and making funny poses then jump again when it says go. The only complaint I have is that it is not foldable. It takes over alot of space in my boys room.We live in an apartment and when they are jumping there is no banging noise on the floor to bother our neighrbors I like that as well."
66112,0,"This formula is a great formula but for one detail that is very important for alot of our dogs. It has rice powder in it, and for a dog that has an intolerance/allergy to rice and grains, it is a big NO NO. So I&#34;m torn on the review..I wish they didn't put the rice powder in it, because i know it works, as I've used it on dogs before that were not allergic to grains.Wish the company would take that rice out of there, I have no clue why it would even be IN there???"
78566,1,"This jammer fit me me perfectly. I've only had it for a couple of weeks and have used it twice, but it seems to be holding up pretty good so far. The white stripes are translucent, but they are along the side of the leg, so its not really a factor to me. I'm 6'3"" and 210, with large legs, and I did not find the legs to be excessively tight. I've been using them for pool use only, so I guess time will tell on how durably they hold up to the chlorine."
78115,0,"If you are over 6 feet tall I would stay away from Russell items. I have had problems with the arms being too short in the past, but I figured I would try this ""nu blend."" Same problem- Russell seems to be under the impression that all athletes have short arms."
389701,2,I was pleased with these until 3 weeks later when the entire skate fell apart. Not happy that my daughter is in tears because her skates fell apart so quickly. You get what you pay for. Cheap skates cheap quality
308665,2,"About ten days after the rope arrived I was working out at 70 lbs and the right rubber head came off. When I attempted to re-attach by re-tightening the Phillips screw, the hole (in the rope itself) seemed stripped. A thin screw with narrow threads seems an inadequate attachment for what really is an easily compromised opening in a piece of rope--for once loosened, the attachment cannot be made secure again. Clearly a defective unit but still should not have happened."
497887,1,I now own 7 pairs of these underwear and couldn't be happier. Excellent for people that are active and perspire. Wont' ride up like most other boxer briefs I've owned.

22379,1,"I recently went on a pack trip into the mountains, and my family started worrying ahead of time about my back. I did some research on sleeping pads and decided that a pad by itself would not be enough to cushion my middle aged bones. I read the reviews on the Big Agnes inflatable mattresses, and they looked like they might be the answer to my problem.The package arrived in a nice, tidy bundle that packed easily. When we got to our base camp, I inflated the mattress and set up my ""bed."" To my amazement, I slept like a baby every night! Big Agnes never lost any air and kept me off the cold ground (28 degrees). The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the mattress is a tad narrow. I learned not to roll over in my sleep so I would not roll off the mattress. I got the 78"" length and found that it was easier to stretch out with the longer length. It was an excellent investment."
177315,0,"I thought this might make a nice extra under my jacket when I'm out. However, the not-so-great steel and rather loose fit of the holster make it a no go. Per the price-it's great, but I practice throw all my knives at a dartboard and these bent the tips easily. The loose fit holster could be modified but I have others that do the job already =)"
177290,1,We use this in our greywater system to circulate water (not always the cleanest either). Works well and uses minimal electricity.
470338,0,"It's a neat item, but with no lid, even though it was advertised as having a lid. It will work as a cooler, or other uses. Quality seems good."
202901,2,"I should have read the reviews. Pin hole did not align due to weld, was about 1/8-1/4 of an inch off. I was also disappointed there was no mention that this adapter was not meant for towing until you open the package. It'll probably be ok for small boat, which was my purpose of buying, or jet ski or other light towing, but not worth the chance."

200636,0,"I bought these for myself and my husband for Christmas and to be honest, I haven't noticed any difference. I have really bad back pain as well as carpal tunnel in both wrists so I was really really hoping to see some sort of a change. My husband was interested because he was hoping to feel a relief from a sports injury to his wrist. Neither of have noticed a difference. My husband stopped wearing his after about a month and a half, but I continued to wear mine and now his nearly 5 months later. They're comfortable and look nice though, as well as sturdy."
122118,1,"I received the bag and it is just what I wanted. Not a problem, well made. Should last a very long time."
319655,0,"I had no trouble fitting this mirror, but after a couple of weeks I did not find it useful for commuting in urban streets.I have to turn my head by about 30 degrees to be able to see behind me. There is no sense of taking a quick glance behind - I have to move my head and line up the rear view in the mirror. All in all more trouble than turning my head 90 degrees and getting a full view of the road behind. I tried mounting the mirror further to the edge of the lens, thinking I wouldn't have to turn my head so much, but there was too much eyestrain moving my eyeball that far.There is a noticeable blind spot where the mirror obscured the forward vision. This isn't directly forward as the mirror is mounted to one side, but it is in the area where the other eye cannot see, so it certainly causes issues.It mounts close to the eye - my eye lashes rub, but surprisingly I quickly got used to that, and it didn't bother me.A problem with all mirrors is lack of 3D depth. As one only uses one eye to look through the mirror the resulting scene lacks 3D information, which, in an urban setting, results in a confusion of objects that takes further viewing time to resolve.One situation where I did find this mirror useful was in pulling a paceline (race training), where I could regularly and easily check to see if at least the rider behind me was still on.Another situation I could envision that this mirror would prove useful would be riding rural roads at night, where solitary headlights of cars behind would be easily spotted.But for daylight / nightime urban commuting I find myself not using it at all, but looking over my shoulder as usual, and sometimes getting irritated when the blind spot causes me to have to move my head further just to glance sideways.I'll be returning this item."
258594,0,"The bore snake is quick and easy to use, but doesn't do as good a job as a rod and patches/brush. I put solvent on the front area of the snake (before the brush) and ran it through a couple times. It took a lot of solvent to be wet enough since much soaks into the interior of the snake. Powder crap was sort of ""flung"" around when the brush emerged from the muzzle, much like running your finger over a wet toothbrush.I then soaked the rear with Remoil and ran it through. It looked very good, with a few grains of powder residue and no visible wad residue. I ran it through a few more times, and it looked fantastic. Total passes was 5 (2 with solvent, 3 with remoil). Awesome, I thought.I then did my usual rod & patch job with solvent and was very surprised at how black the patch was. Normally I need 4 swabs with solvent, and the first patch after using the snake looked slightly cleaner than my normal second patch.In summary, it does a good job of getting the major crud out, though it is messy and takes a lot of solvent. It seems useful if you are shooting a LOT (e.g., a tournament) for a mid-day cleanup or a quick run-through in the field, but I'll be using the rod & patch in the future."

14136,1,"We are from Aus and could not believe the fast shipping on this purchase!Now to the product itself, this tent has been extremely well designed and is everything it should be.Quality - A+- The quality of the material is second to none, the zips and poles are all very well made, not flimsy cheap stuff.Set up - A+- We took this away for a weekend and the set-up of the tent took 2 of us about 10minutes, we had set it up before at home to work out the basics. But the ease in which it takes to set it up was great as we had rain coming and had to get it done quickly. This also prevents any tent-set-up fights, this one is so straight forward.Effectiveness as a tent - A+- So roomy! Great head height, lots of breeze when you don't have the rainfly on. The pockets on the sides are very handy for phones, torches etc.- We had rain (& heavy sometimes) during the night, but the rainfly kept all the water off the tent, not a spot on it when we packed it up except for the lower sides. The awning also held up well with the wet weather, no problems there.Overall this is a fantastic product and we must stress the need for something like this to be distributed in Oz!Thanks for a great purchase!"
111597,1,Fast delivery and of good quality for karate or tae kwon doe. I do practice Brazilian Jui Jitsu and the belt will stand up for use but it lacks the extra fabric tip for placing stripes.

301622,0,"Great looking watch, very sporty. Date is easily readable. The LumiBright Hands and markings are amazing in low light and in the dark, I have had this watch for 4 weeks now. I love the bulky rotating bezel, sturdy strap. I just love the feel of the watch, it definately has some weight, but it adds to perceived build quality. Everything seems sturdy. But none of this matters as the watch runs 10 min faster than usual. At first setting nothing is noticeable after a few days the watch will run 1-2 min fast, no big deal, but after a few more days the watch seems to run 10 min fast. This is because of the constant change in tempreature where I live. Right now in Toronto tempreature is about 0 to 5 degrees C, but in the morning the tempreature is colder and warmer by mid-day so this affects the mechanical movement and this watch tends to run fast.Cant keep accurate time, in my situation, but it is superbly made, the weighty feel, illustrates quality workmanship. So my review for this watch is neutral."
295099,0,"Bought this for DS for scouts. It's light, has a pocket in the front inside which is big enough for everything he wants to keep close, and zippers function well.

292284,0,"My expectations were very high for this bottle and were unfortunately not met. I'm sure it's perfect for some people and their uses. My use is at the gym primarily while running on the treadmill.The sport cap makes an annoying draining sound when you use it and I am constantly banging it on my teeth. I've found a good angle to hold it so that this happens less often, but still annoying.I have the 40oz red one and I'm tired of everyone asking me ""what is that? A fire extinguisher?"".On the treadmill, the bottle's large girth means it fit awkwardly into either the ledge or onto the pocket (depending on which treadmill you're using).Pros: the water tastes great and the metal keeps it cold for a long time. The sport is smart but a little ill-designed. Eager for the next version."
317023,1,"I received the gloves both left and right, they are very nice and well made. I love to wear a pair during practice. I recommended this style to my friends. The fingers and the palm size are running smaller than the Fila,and the other European or Japanese brands. Medium is a bit tight on me, I am wearing 21cm. If you have longer fingers, size Large might be better. It is a pity that the beautiful British green is not available for purchase."

120162,0,"I use dumbbells and weight machines. I use hooks in order to avoid gripping the bar too hard. These Gofit hooks will do the job; but I like the Harbinger hooks better - they have a larger hook and a longer wrist strap. The larger hook slips off less easily and the longer wrist strap makes them easier to put on. If you do any heavy lifting, I'd recommend the Harbinger also since they are more robust."
157527,1,"I recently purchased this seat saddle cover and so for it has been great for that extra bit of bike seat comfort. The fit was a bit tight when I fitted it onto my custom seat saddleSchwinn Pillow Top Cruiser Bicycle Seat, in which helps the product stay in its place while riding (Check customer images above). Another customer reviewer from Amazon.com recommended customers to take a look at a Sheldon Brown's bike locking strategy for certain bike U-Locks; this same person also has a section on his web site about seat saddles (Google Sheldon Brown Seat Saddle); excellent information. I recommend this product if it goes on sale because, at its current price, the marginal benefit doesn't exceed the marginal price of the product (You might as well purchase a seat saddle instead of a seat saddle cover before anything). The best advice I can give you is to go to your local bike shop to test out these seat saddle/cover products first to know what type of material and seat saddle size works well for your behind."

These socks while not a cure all for foot problems have improved my overall foot health and have helped keep me from having recurrences of some of the foot problems that I have had in the past.
398591,1,I bought this model with the CR rating in mind. The box arrived early and in perfect condition. Only thing missing from the box was the water bottle. It was fairly easy to put together. I had two 23 month old assistants and had it up and running within 2 hours. The machine runs quiet and smooth. The screen is difficult to read. My husband and I both use it and is holding up wonderfully. We've had it for a little of a month now. It's great and even better for the price.

But hey, if you insist on getting this go ahead but when the sword arrives, you're going to be all excited untill you notice the details of it. I passed it up for 15 bucks."
241833,1,"Usually when a product has only positive reviews (a negative review that has nothing to do with the product itself doesn't count) always makes me a bit skeptic, but I'm now a believer.To be fair I've only had these pants for a week, but here's the story so far -I received the box 2 days after completing my order through Amazon. As I handled the box, I immediately noticed two things - the tape was coming off a bit and there was a bit of heft for a box that supposedly only contained two pairs of pants.As I went inside and eagerly tore away the plastic wrapping, I could feel the durable material with which my new pants were made. It's thick, durable, and just a bit rough to the touch. I put them on, half expecting a itchy reception, but found the fit to be comfortable and warm.In the course of the last week I've climbed trees, jumped walls, swung kettlebells and was down on my knees trying to revive a fire in the fireplace. Through it all, they've been comfortable and easy to move in. I'm only worried about the thickness of the material becoming an issue in the summer time when it tends to reach into the high 90's and gets really, really humid."

229104,0,"I was wearing the minimus from newbalance and was looking for a minimalist shoe and stumbled upon this. For about twenty bucks this is definitely worth it, but you can tell that you paid quite a bit less by the quality and durability of this shoe. The price is the best thing about this shoe, it isn't very stylish, and it feels a bit cheap. I wear a 10.5 in the US, so I thought a 44 would be a pretty good guess at what I'd wear but I should have gone with a 43. I scrunched up a paper towel in my shoes to make up for getting the size too big and it fits much better. Definitely worth the buy at $20, but don't expect anything close to the other minimalist shoes."

449155,0,"I bought these hand grippers after seeing the insane amount of good reviews that people posted. I went with the No.1 to start out with after seeing how so many people said they were hard. The No.1 was pretty easy to close and I'm no professional body builder. If you can bench over 135 pounds I would start with the No.2. The one negative aside from the crazy price of these is how sharp the grip is, it was sharp enough to draw blood and I don't have lady hands. I decided to remove the foam grips off of a cheap gripper I had laying around and put them on the COC gripper(see picture). Wow, what a world of difference that made, no more overly torn up hands. I am taking off 2 stars for the price and the mini-razors they put on the handle."
247834,1,"I got exactly what I wanted, a good 100% cotton long sleeve tee shirt to keep me warm in cool weather. I needed cotton because I work in an environment where there's a risk of fire so I can't wear synthetic fibers that would melt. I'm completely happy with the shirt, I like the fact that it does not have a tag in the back of the collar. If I remember correctly it came with a tag sewn into the side seam which I tore out easily. This shirt has a small logo on the left sleeve which I could do without but doesn't particularly bother me either."
354927,0,"I ordered a size 43 for my size 10 (American men's) feet after consulting several different sizing charts. The shoes are at least two sizes too small, more like size 8 or 8.5.

Quality is not great, but neither is it poor. I will try ordering a larger pair in the future."

43092,0,"Three of these hammocks were bought for a camping trip with my kids (ages 12 and 14). The first observation, the hammock does not come with a attach it to a tree. So my kids learned how to braid cord into rope so we could hang our hammocks.The item as its shown at the time of this review says it comes with a free hanging kit. It this hammock does not come with a hanging kit, make sure you get something to hang this hammock with - or you will be sleeping on the ground.I was disappointed that the hammocks did not come with at least a few feet of nylon rope. All you get in this package is the hammock, no rope, no cord no nothing to hang it with. To fix this problem, I bought some nylon rope and some D-rings with an 800 pound safe working limit. The D-rings can now be used for other things, as needed.The stuff sack is attached to the side of the hammock. This is a nice touch, as it prevents you from loosing the stuff sack and its nice for having your flashlight close by at night.The hammock needs to be a little wider, as you can roll out of it somewhat easily. I was sitting next to the camp fire and heard a ""thud"" - looked over and my 14 year old son had rolled out of his hammock. Good thing for him it was only about a foot off the ground. While I was trying to go to sleep in the hammock, I rolled around and almost fell out.Overall this is a good quality, but its made in communist china. I was disappointed to see that the hammock was not made in the USA."
411576,0,"I bought the Weider 5000 on September 9, on December 2009 the plastic on the handle cracked and the webbing of the handle got caught and ripped nearly in half before I noticed it. Called the company and they told me the warranty ran out yesterday. The new handles would have cost me $53.00 plus shipping. I will make a set of handles that will last more than 3 months. The machine does what I want it to do but it is cheaply made. Keep an eye on every part of it before you exercise."
57920,1,"I used this for my early morning (2am) hike on Mt Whitney. It was pretty good going by brightness level. Fitting was also good. I think the battery life is long compared with some of the others, as I saw many hikers who battery died after 4-5 hours and were following me on the hike. Hope my review helps you in buying this product."

If you dont mind THAT, then these are great because the material is good and sturdy, its like a heavy duty aluminum I think."
473232,1,"I bought these glove liners to wear under my everyday gloves when I walk my dog on those especially bitter cold days when I still need to remove the outer glove to attach and remove his leash etc.This site is an equestrian supply, not sports or ski wear. I don't ride but from their description and some other reviews here I think riders wear flexible leather gloves, while skiers wear thick, insulated gloves. I find ski glove liners to be light and shear - much more prone to runs and to pulling them off along with my thinner, everyday, leather outer gloves, which defeats their purpose and isn't really what they are made for.These gloves are thicker, more fitted to the hand, and don't pull off so easily when removing the outer glove. Therefore they perform as intended to keep my hands from getting really cold when I remove the outer glove, such as to retrieve money from my wallet and put change back in. They really keep my fingers toasty so I don't have to wait for my leather outer gloves to warm my hands up again - not their strong point.Today I went out with my dog and realized I had only put on the silk liners and had forgotten my outer gloves. Even in 25 degree weather I was surprised my hands were quite warm enough for the hour-long walk. Never would my shear silk ski glove liners have performed so well. After a month of use, no runs, no tears, very sturdy but comfortable and soft.Only reason for four stars instead of five is delivery from this vendor - not through Amazon - was a little slow; although understandable due to heavy volume of holiday mail. Still, Amazon would have gotten them to me faster.I recommend and would absolutely buy these glove liners again."
280226,1,"I ordered to start excercising by myself, and when I tested it after I received, it was awesome. The rope itself was easy to manipulate. So, eventhough I ran to fast speed, it worked with no coiling at all.But the length of rope is hard to adjust. A clip pintches the rope strongly, it seemed to take time to shorten it."

25416,1,"I bought this mat to use in my truck bed when I go camping in my Sportz TruckTent. It works well enough, but man is it ever hard. I guess it has to be because it's only 3 inches thick. It's better than sleeping on the bare truck bed, better than sleeping on the ground, better than my air mattress because it won't pop, but I'll need to get a soft pad for the top of it to get a good nights sleep."
276845,0,"This item was marketed as ""For Her"". As a man I just bought it because it fit my needs. I use it 5 days a week. The good part is this stepper is small, easily stored, and gives a good workout.The bad part is the cable does not last more than a year for my 185 lb male body. Perhaps it might last longer with lighter women. My advice: this device works, but the day you buy it, buy 2 extra cables.All the company needs to do is make the cable stronger for heavier men. And it would be a fairly good buy at $60us."
31919,0,"This is a good glove. It is designed to be sturdy and, when stitched well, this glove will last you for at least few months if not years. I use this for lifting all types of weights including weight lifting machines, free weights, and dumb bells.My main problem with this glove is that the left glove has very bad stitching and fell to pieces in various areas. The finger wrap area came apart and then the nylon yarn in the wrist area started to come off. This happened on the very first day of usage.The right glove has good stitching and works well.I would actually buy this glove again knowing that I probably received a defective left glove and it is probably not that common. But the quality control of Harbinger needs improvement."

Besides, most items have directions in 10 different languages. What product lacks ANY (there were ZERO directions). Shampoo has frickin' directions. The most ridiculous things have directions. Preposterous these had no directions nor specs. What were these imbeciles thinking? They just (erroneously) assume they'll work for all bike pedals? Very sloppy and unprofessional they didn't even denote which pedals they'll work for and which ones they won't."
364743,0,"This stadium seat was ok. It really did not support my back the way I thought it would, but at least my butt did not hurt!"
496103,0,"My 15 year old seat was worn torn and ugly and I saw this on sale so I bought it. Its about as uncomfortable as the old seat on my 10 speed but it sure looks a lot nicer. The seat is pretty firm, so lighter people may not get much cushioning out of the padding. You do have to tighten the snot out of the bolts otherwise it will tilt after its mounted. Just like most seats, you can flip the mounting bracket and slide the seat forward or backward on the rails to fine tune your reach to the bars.Edit added here: After switching this to a few different bikes I got to say, this seat works a lot better on a relaxed bike than a ""sport"" bike. The cushioning actually works when you have lots of weight placed on it. On a road bike with your weight on your legs and arms its not so good. Make sure you're going to use it only on a short trip bmx/cruiser/hybrid if you buy it. Something with the seat lower than the bars. FYI its not as fat as the fisheye photo would lead you to believe.."
173158,1,"This bike trailer is a good value for the money. It is easy to assemble and attach to a bike. I would have liked to have seen a sturdier seat inside the trailer itself though. The spring assembly where the trailer attaches to the bike is very flexible, which makes it very nice for hauling. I was able to fold the bike down on top of the trailer with it still attached to the bike frame and still fit it in my Ranger."

Not a bad product, but certainly not for tots."
34926,1,"Okay, the battery experience is less than ideal, but it's not as bad as people seem to think. You should not pry out the foam padding from the ear muff. The black padded ring around the ear snaps off. Then you can easily remove the foam padding and insert the batteries."
351338,2,"I purchased this pump because I wanted something small, compact, portable, and most of all, easy to use. I have next to no experience with maintaining bikes and have always used stand-up bike pumps in the past. This pump had great reviews and I needed a pump asap so I figured, ""Why not?""First the pros, this bike bump is lightweight, sturdy, and comes with a convenient bike frame clip so that it can be carried with you at all times. The bike frame clip comes with additional screws so it's all one set package. For that it's great.I had trouble using this however. The air intake for my tire was positioned very close to the spokes so navigating the bulky head of this pump to the intake was an effort and a half. Eventually I was able to muscle it on by pulling the intake out quite a bit and bending it away from the spokes. Am I doing this incorrectly? Maybe, but it was not as easy as the stand-up bike pumps I had used in the past with skinny tops.I also did not have much confidence latching onto the air intake. With the stand-up pumps I've used, when you push the mechanism on and clamp down the latch, you've got a secure hold on the intake. With the Blackburn Mountain Air pump, I never felt like I had a secure grip on the intake. I would push it on as tight as possible, clamp it down, and then the pump would fall off the intake 3-4mm. I was looking for the air being let out of the tire before I clamped down on the latch, but that wasn't there. Eventually I just started pumping and to my surprise, it worked.Would I have bought this product again? Probably not. I had very little luck with the pump and once I did get it to work, I didn't do so with confidence. I would probably either default back to a stand-up pump or another portable one, but not this."

It is somewhat complicated to fold but after a few times it is relative easy. The instructions are a little confusing. After you fold it in two, you just have to remember to fold it up and under to make it go back into a circle. It appears to be durable and the zipper works well. Like the numerous pockets for storing clothes, the zippered window section to reach through for a towel. There is a plastic mat which velcros in place, but as someone else reviewed it retains water and is a little slippery. Next time we will use a tire mat when using it for a shower. The only disadvantage is that it is not strong enough to hold a solar shower. There are strings provided to do that but the solar shower was too heavy. If you are using it for a shower, it has to be under a tree or a wire strung between trees. The boys loved it!!!!!"

63092,2,"These breeches were NOT cotton. They were a polyester/spandex blend, so I returned them. If polyester works in your climate, they were very nice breeches, but in 110+ heat, poly is a no-no. The seller said they would fix the link to the product description, and they may have, but be aware."
54788,0,The sight appears decent however the process for adjusting windage and elevation leave a lot to be desired. Also. the base while susposedly suitable for Weaver rails needs to be openned up to fit properly.In both cases the adjustments are difficult and not easily managed. There seems to be not enough of one and too much of the other.Still for the price and they are decent pieces of equipment.
440410,1,I bought this for a budget gun carbine 9mm. It did great on there and held zero well. Then I moved it to a 20 ga shot gun and it still held up well. Now its loaned out to a friend with a 9mm carbine and he is loving it. I have sever other red dots that are MUCH MUCH more expensive and although this one is not quite as nice...it does a great job and shouldnt be overlooked when shopping for budget optics.
191294,0,"Why does Amazon recommend this anchor for the 8 Foot Heavy Duty Beach Umbrellas UPF100+ with Tilt - Fiberglass Ribsby Sun which we ordered?! It does not fit!! The anchor is probably great for an umbrella that fits, but why link it to one that won't fit in it?!"
324788,1,"After a lot of research, including reading the reviews on this site, I selected this grill as a Father's Day present. I am glad I did. After 6 tailgates this fall, I would recommend this grill with some comments:The negative review saying you cannot grill with the top down is wrong -- as one of the reviewers made very clear: NEVER GRILL ON HIGH. Put the temp on medium, and you can close the lid with no problem.I bought the stovetop grid and the griddle from Amazon. Used the griddle for sausages and hashbrowns. Made eggs in a cast iron pan on the stove grate. Did burgers, sausages and chicken on the grill grates. Everything came out great.Get the rollable storage bag. you have to take the hendle off of the LXE after you put it in the bag in order to close it. I just put the handle in the mesh pouch on the front.The propane adapter for full size propane tanks is a great idea. but I did six tailgates on three small propane canisters.Easy to use. Cleans up easy (I covered the bottom with foil and cut out around the burners). Put the grids in foil to bring home -- used oven cleaner in the laundry tub overnight.Very, very pleased with this product."
350387,1,"I bought this watch because I needed a new Baby-G since my old one was getting dirty (it was one of the blue gelly ones). The atomic time adjustment is definitely this watch's big selling point, but it is also a pretty classy looking watch for a Shock resistant sports watch. I was worried about all the comments about complicated buttons and the size of the watch itself and so I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the watch is actually smaller than my other Baby-G and that the directions make the watch very simple to operate. I also liked that the functions for the buttons are labeled on the backside of the watch, leaving the front face looking uncluttered. It certainly doesn't look like it's a digital watch due to it's major analog component, but it still has the perks of a digital watch, with an alarm and digital time, date, and day read-out. (I personally don't use the stopwatch, countdown watch, or the world time but those are nice too).The LED light is orange and lights up the face pretty well, however it does not quite reach the top two digital displays. You can set the length of time the light stays on as well, and since the analog hands glow in the dark, the light really isn't that necessary to begin with unless you need to see where the numbers are on the watch. But for those who know the basics of analog watches (like where twelve, three, six and nine o'clocks are) it shouldn't be a problem.I am very happy with this watch and despite my early concerns when I first ordered it, seeing it in person and actually using and wearing it banished all those worries in a heartbeat.I would definitely recommend this watch to any woman who needs a classy looking, accurate, and reliable watch!"
221517,0,"I was so happy to receive free shipping, but when we opened it one door had fallen off completely, and as we were fixing it the other hinge fell off. It looks great, however you are going to need some tools and patience if you are going to make it work."
36623,1,"I read a ton of reviews on different exercise bikes and decided this was the one. It came well packed with everything intact. I had originally hired someone to assembe it, but when I unpacked the box I realized that I could probably do this myself (and I am by no means handy).The assembly instructions were wonderful, easy to follow, and actually made sense. Everything needed for assembly (screws, bolts, washers, tools) was neatly shrink wrapped and marked so that it was a snap to identify what was needed and use it. It took me less than 2 hours to assemble is and most of that is because I have arthiritus and had to stop now and then.The bike itself is really solid. It rides better than the one at my gym. It's nearly soundless and sturdy. The programs are just what I wanted and will provide me with the fitness level I want to maintain.One small issue - the fan did not work when assembled but calling customer service resolved that issue quickly with a replacement part.All in all this is a great bike."
120789,0,"I had ordered the Air Kicks, but they were not available by Christmas, so they substituted Kickaroos (with my permission). The theory is great, but in reality, you can barely get off the ground with them. The plastic piece on the front keeps slipping off after a few jumps, and so you are constantly sliding it back. The sub price was great, so I guess it's an ok deal, but had I paid full price, I would have been disappointed."
224517,0,Its a hopper. Iver used it for around 10 games and it is already starting to crack where it connects to the gun. Balls often get jammed in the neck requiring you to shake it. If only I had more money to buy an electronic hopper.On another note you can more than likely pick up a hopper for a cheaper price at an big box store
226708,0,"i did not care for the hogue grips and later bought pachmyer grips. putting the grips on and removing them was time consuming. plus, the metal piece needed to attach the grip to the frame could scratch the frame. i do not recommend them. however, they were shipped in a timely manner and arrived in good condition."
431202,0,"Rack mounted easily and works well. Only thing missing when compared to ""real"" Pletscher rack on my other bike is a flip up bracket that keeps larger items from sliding out from under the spring loaded arm. The mounting holes are there but there is no bracket supplied."
411998,0,"I love the portability of this tent. I've taken it out 5 times the last season.When putting this thing together the back pole is fine however, the front pole that arc's around the door is always very hard to put in the sleeve provided. I always feel like I'm about to rip through the fabric as it bends to make the half circle shape for the door. When taking it apart the pole always gets stuck midway through and it takes me to a frustration level that I could do without. I will continue to use this tent due to the weight/price pointe.When the fabric breaks due to stress I will be writing a seperate review :)I do recommend this for others looking for lightweight comfortable bivy's. I just don't think it will be handling multiple years of use."
56900,2,"Don't waste your time with this bag if you are serious about a workout and want something that will last. I have busted two of them inside of six months. The first lasted about four months. Everlast sent a replacement after I complained and it lasted two months before it sprang a leak in the side. Also, the bag will bulge in the side and at the bottom. Finally the top of the bag seems to collapse after some use and forms and uneven surface that is difficult to hit without injuring your hand or foot. All around a bad design and dose nothing for the fine name of Everlast."
310145,0,"This was an Ok purchase. The tent was cheap and the delivery was timely. But you get what you pay for. The tent is somewhat awkward to setup but not too bad. We bought this for our surf fishing excursions for a changing tent and potty tent. It packs up nicely in the car but the tent stakes that it came with won't hold it steady on the sand, I had to buy sand stakes for it to stay in one place. It held up nicely to a stiff ocean breeze. The one downside is the zipper. It is very hard to open/close the zipper because the fabric is stretched so tightly when the tent is erect. It could also use a pocket for holding the TP. You definitely don't want that to get sandy. I'll look for something better when this one breaks."
6239,2,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.This is the second cardio type workout I have tried by this instructor and both suffer from the same problem. With the rather complex choreography that flows awkwardly, even with excellent cuing, it would still be confusing to pick up. Unfortunately, a lot of times the cuing seems minimal or late which adds to the problem. The awkward flow is even more noticeable with kickboxing which needs to have a certain natural flow to blend all the foot and directional changes. Even if you persevere to get used to the choreography, they have slowed down the moves to the point that you never really get a good workout. It would be preferable to simplify the moves and keep it intense enough to get you to your target heart rate.Speaking of kickboxing per se, if you are talking aerobics adapted to include kicking, the instructor is ok. If you are talking kickboxing adapted to maintain an aerobic level, then the kicks were just bad form and weak. If instructors tell you to look in the direction you punch/kick and imagine something there to punch/kick, I start to expect more. Instructor should be able to cue you with exactly what kind of kick is being used and execute it with good form, balance, and strength.That said, Instructor always utilizes music well to time moves (which others seem to largely negelect.) The free weight workout in this series is more focused and does not suffer from the problems that seem to be forming a pattern in the cardio type workouts.Considering all the cons and, ultimately, having barely worked up a sweat, this was just not good."

197091,1,Fantastic fun and can easily support upto 150lbs. Easy to use straight out of the package. Only glitch is you have to continually charge it for many hours for a 20-30 ride. But the kids love it!
310189,1,Perfect - exactly what the FYWBL (Front Yard Wiffle Ball League) wanted! Easy way to please a group of 13-year-olds.
334898,0,"This rack is pretty nice. The construction is very simple so you're left with the feeling that it was a bit overpriced, but it works nicely and looks good.The rack that was delivered, however, doesn't look like the picture. In the picture the rails stick straight out, but the ones delivered slant upward at about a 30 deg angle. This isn't a big deal, but as shown it looks like you can mount the racks on a wall all the way up next to the ceiling, while still being able to use the top rack. With the angled rails, you have to mount it much lower onto the wall or else you can't get the board up and over the top rails (the rails will actually hit the ceiling if hung too high, making it impossible to use the top rack).Anyway, it looks fine and works fine, but be aware that what you see isn't what you get."
130415,0,"I like many things about this blanket. It's machine washable, a must!, its colorful, and its definitely water proof! but its also light so it blows away with just a tiny bit of wind. It is also very thin and plasticy. Not very comfortable since it's so thin and if the ground you are on is only a bit tilted you will slide, it is super slick on the botom. Not good for the beach (d/t the wind) but nice for a soggy field of (flat) grass since it will keep you dry. 2 1/2 stars in my book."

75297,2,"I follow NASCAR and look forward to the release of the NASCAR game every year. In previous years I have enjoyed the career mode where you start in the Whelan series and work your way up to the Nextel series. I thought with the PS3 version, there would be lots of extras and career modes. However, the career options are very limited and have not held my attention. Also, in trying to allow you to set up the cars for racing, they have made it impossible to control the cars even in easy modes. It is impossible to get through a race without causing a yellow flag (the yellow flag is thrown so quick, sometimes you don't even see the wreck). I think this game will be a trade-in at Gamestop for Dirt which has a great demo on the PS3."
290214,0,I loved the look of these flipflops and I always wear a size 8 but when I received these....they were a little small for my feet. They still kinda fit and I really liked how they look so I kept them regardless.
407556,0,The Stick was highly recommended by my physical fitness trainer. She recommended that I use it to relief muscle tenseness. I have used it a couple of times. I don't really feel a difference at this point.
433952,1,Receive this product and try setting it up in my living room. It is as easy as one-two-three just putting 3 rods thru the 3 seams. It is also very light weighted. I have this setup by myself and no problem at all. Just need a large open area.The 3 netted windows can be closed and so as the front zipper to provide privacy and air circulation on 4 sides so quite stable compare to other products that is open in the back or only on the sides. The inside is very spacious and can provide lots of shade. Two five food person can lie flat across the tent inside under shade and still have ample of head and leg room. Really glad I order this. We are ready for summer and will definitely take this along with us to the beach and park and leave our beach umbrella at home. This product is 1/2 the size of our beach umbrella but provide 4 times the shade and shelter. Would recommend this product especially if you have little kids.
484854,2,"Terrible interface; one button to do multiple functions and one light to indicate one of 13 different states that the recorder can be in! It doesn't work if you put it in your running pocket; the FAQ on the timex site says it may be static electricity. You'll be better of keeping a log manually until they produce one of these with a better display and control scheme, and one that works as advertised."
74194,1,"A decent pillow, good worksmanship, and fairly compressable. But if you are approaching six feet or just like a 'taller' pillow, keep looking.Way too heavy for backpacking."
219697,0,This item added and extra 10 degrees to my sons' sleeping bags w/o a great addition of weight. They have also slept w/ just the liner and been plenty warm.It is a good addition to your back packing and camping supplies.The item fits easily into the compression sack and packs small.
286485,1,"First of all, my new case is SOLID. Even open it doesn't skew or twist. The top doesn't compress at all and the lip makes a smooth seal all around.There are lots of little details you wouldn't think of, like extra ridges and feet to take the first hits. I live by the sea so materials that are impervious to moisture are essential. The trigger latches are of simple design, easy and fast to open.The neck is wide to hold shaped foam that cradles your fretboard. This also provides more storage--a spare pack of strings lies flat. It gives a nice balance to the big dreadnought body, both in weight and appearance. Did I mention the comfy, oversized handle?This is a beautiful case with a gently arched top. The interior is a classy dark jade velour which vacuums well and won't show stains.So I'm a fan. The SKB18 costs only a few coins more than an average box, and truly has some superior features. Look no further."
106835,1,Work great with no chemicals--use them with my small children whom I do not like to spray with DEET. Mild odor is not noticed when worn on an ankle.
376218,1,"After doing a good bit of research into a cheaper against wall bike stand I decided on the Delta Michelangelo Gravity Stand and I am very happy with my decision. I live in an apartment where I need to store my bike indoors and where I am not allowed to put holes in the wall so it was important that I had a way to store my bike that didn't require screws. This bike stand is perfect. It leans against the wall with a plastic pad (which I put a towel behind to insure it didn't scratch) and two legs that stick out away from the wall. The legs hold firm in the carpet on my floor and I haven't been at all concerned with the sturdiness of the frame since I put the bike up, even when the cats or I bump into it now and again. The hooks are easy to move to set up the bike in the position you desire and quiet sturdy. I did find that if you leave the front wheel of the bike on that it does have the tendency to swing out. I solved this problem with a small bungy cord or rope around the front wheel and frame. Since then the wheel hasn't swung at all that the bike hangs beautifully. For a cheaper bike rack, this does the job of keeping my bike up off the floor indoors and it is sleek enough to look nice even in an small apartment. I am very happy with it."
458441,0,"There seems to be a possible issue with the color of these tees....for me, they appear a bright, nearly neon color. Since you get so many for a VERY cheap price, these tees did exctly what they're designed to do. Would probably opt to go with a more natural hue in the future, but for now these work just fine. They're decent quality, super cheap tees that any novice golfer shouldn't be ashamed to try out. Not a five star review by any means, but until we find better v. the price Hubby plans to stick with these."
209163,0,"One of the snaps on the buckle was loose and unable to be fixed on the first pair of skates we received. We couldn't let my 5 year old daughter use her new birthday present as a result. She took it well, and the return process with Amazon was very painless. Her new pair showed up about a week later, she was quite happy after that!"
392189,1,"Bought this as a gift for our son. He is happy with it! I accidentally bought a woman's model first and had to return it, that trasaction was smooth and hassle free! Great work AMAZON"
188323,0,"They can't lie, it MUST make a 3000 degree spark, but the spark would only be 3000 degrees RIGHT at the VERY point of creation, and cools RAPIDLY as it flies through the air. It's also very difficult to light anything if you're an amateur. It might be easy with training, but there aren't really any instructions that come with it. I've worked out several ways to use it and using the best method I've tried I can get a spark distance of a yard (about a metre) and it still won't light anything for me unless I use some sort of flammable spray like Deodorant first.It's pretty cool though. Makes a lot of light, with a very bright spark, it hurts if you look at it.Maybe you need better tinder too, I've used newspaper, magazines, tissues, straight wood, a dry leaf. Nothing."
446662,1,The ankle weights have been great. Exercising faithfully since I got them. A friend and I have organized an exercise group of friends and it gives us a healthy excuse to get together a couple of times a week.
93342,2,This product fits well but is fairly thin. To be fair though it is as thick as any that come in production bikes today. I would double this product foradditional protection.
127515,0,....if i wanted to use my old grips. I ordered these by mistake and thought they were Hogue grips. I was disappointed but If I had a nice set of grips and wanted to add the wrap around finger grooves I can now use this. Adds like a 1mm on each side of the grips when installed.
13613,1,Got these for my runner husband. They keep him cool and wick the sweat away and are comfortable and yet lightweight.
312667,0,No complaints. this product is pretty much the same jump rope I used in gradeschool gym class and does what I needed it to do.
394734,1,The sleeping bag is comfortable and well-insulated. I slept in pajamas and undercloathes and was comfortable in both garments. It is a good buy. It came soon after purchase. This company is highly reccomended.
183684,1,"I'm from Argentina and purchased this halter because I can't get Draft horse size products in my country (the biggest ones here run too small). The quality just amazes me! Very stylish for my grey Percheron horses solid build and happy to see it has a loose fit even on the largest heads. Years ago a bought a Hamilton harness for my Husky. Hamilton will never let you down, It's worth every cent you pay!!!!!"
115225,0,"Good points:-- Low price.-- Easy to use.-- Pretty good picture quality overall, but tends to overexpose in very bright sunlight, such as around a swimming pool.-- Nice set of mounting accessories.-- Works well underwater.Bad Points:-- Hard to tell where the camera is pointing due to lack of viewfinder. Best approach is to sight along the top of barrel.-- Sound is terrible unless camera is underwater, although others have suggested this can be cured by removing the waterproof membrane over the microphone. Of course, then it's no longer waterproof."
70453,0,This watch is very good looking. The face is not huge and looks good. The only problem I have is the description states a screw down crown. Not true. I dont know if this is going to let water come in or not. only time will tell.
57165,0,"This is purple. It matches the on-screen color perfectly. But the touch is awful. I had hoped for the warmth and softness of the wool blankets I've had at my yoga studios. But no. This is scratchy, like Grandma's wool sweater. I recommend looking elsewhere. Or better yet, buy a wool yoga blanket in a store if you can so you can touch it first -- makes a huge difference. I felt dumg when I got this...I shouldn't have ordered wool without ""test driving"" it in a store."

95583,0,"I'm only giving a neutral review on this because we still haven't used them. They seem to be what my husband wanted. But I don't want to give out a false review if you know what I mean. Maybe after we have tried them, I can do an update on this review at that time."
406949,0,"I like this safe and didn't have any problems with it until about one year after purchase. I bought this for my vehicle to keep my S&W; safe and locked up when I am at work. I went to open it with the combination system and it would take my code but would not open. So I used my key and then the next day the key would not open it. The little cables inside broke and I could not get the lid open. This is a nice safe but has problems with the opening system. Even though I like it I don't think I would buy another one. What good is a gun safe when you can't get it open? They need some type of system to get it open when the cables break or they need to replace the cables with solid rods. And for the price it is way to expensive to last about a year, maybe fifty dollars tops..The cables will break and you won't get it open so buyers beware. If they correct this problem I will post again. Also you can hit the top with something like a hammer or a piece of pvc pipe and it will pop open. Go to Youtube and type in Secure Vault and watch my videos about this or just type in keithava. Watch these videos before you buy one of these. The company will not reply either. This box is NOT made by ADG but by BOYT. They should not be allowed to sell these.UPDATE:: The company is sending me a new one that I will test. To be fair since they say on their website to make sure it is bolted down I will not be doing the drop test but will test the lid with a piece of 1/2 PVC like in my Youtube video. I ended up buying a Fort Knox Personal Pistol Box, no cheap cables to break.UPDATE: 9/20/2012 I want to change my review. Secure Vault sent me a new updated box. I didn't do the drop test as these are suppose to be bolted down. OK no problem. I did the test smacking the top with a piece of PVC and the box didn't pop open as the old one did. Depending on usage the box will last you a few years, hopefully. The thing I don't like is that they only give you a 1 year warranty. Fort Knox gives you a lifetime warranty, it breaks you get it fixed or replaced. I will use this box and see how long it lasts. You get what you pay."
64919,1,Bought it for my 8 yr old son for his birthday. He absolutely LOVES it. Very durable construction. Would definitely buy another.
379941,0,This bouncer was great for the fact that it entertained my babies. I think I used it as much with the aquarium part as I did without. And if they started to fuss I'd turn on the massage feature and that would give me a bit more time to finish whatever it was I was doing before picking them up. The bad things about this bouncer were that I ended up putting rolled up blankets on either side of them because I found that both babies had a tendency to fall to one side or the other and if left I'm sure they would have ended up hanging off the bouncer altogether. Another bad thing was that I had to stop using it with both babies around 5 months because they started using their stomach muscles to pull themselves forwards and without a five point harness they managed to get forward and totally fell off to one side. No injuries occurred because they were strapped at the waist but I don't think I've moved so fast to get the poor darlings out of their predicament. If looking for bouncers I would suggest something with a 5-point harness because though this one has a great entertainment feature in my opinion the usable life span for each child isn't long enough. I've now borrowed a bouncer/rocker with a 5-point harness from my friend for my 5month old son and I think he'll safely be in that up until he is sitting consistently by himself.

207217,1,"I ordered these gloves for kettlebell classes that I take weekly. I wanted a low-key, breathable glove that would keep me from getting blisters at the tops of my palms, just below my fingers. These gloves do just the trick. The backing is netting that allows my hands to breath. The quality doesn't seem too expensive but that's probably because the netting is like thick string. Otherwise, the leather front and velcro strap are in good condition. Overall a good purchase."

But when I handled it, I was thinking ""Gross, plasticky feeling watch"". So I put it on and it was actually kinda hard to tuck in the wrist strap without it digging into my wrist as I did it. It actually hurts everytime I put it on. But once I get through the pain of the hard plastic getting locked into place on my wrist I am okay. The watch looks nice and is pretty much indestructible.

298178,1,"Took a pair of these to the beach and they performed admirably. Both were light and folded out easily.

The straps running under the chair did get a tad uncomfortable, but that was quickly remedied with a folded beach towel."
170932,0,"The package arrived in less than a week and seemed to be well packaged. My husband and I are setting it up right now and right off the bat I noticed some red flags, the instruction book is filled with typos and miss-spelled words, the DVD is came with told us to ignore the other DVD that was in the package but they both don't work and the disk that it said to use looks like they went to a store and picked up some blank CDS, the allan wrench doesn't even fit the hardware. Instead of sending it back across the country, we are going to try and make it worth while. I just pray it will hold up, I'm only 115 lbs but it still seems iffy. Will update when it finally gets set up correctly."

335283,0,"So I'm at the end of Day 6, feeling a bit hungry and grumpy. Noticing that I'm also a bit spacey.Positives:- I find the exercises to be enjoyable but challenging. I think they are well designed.- The food (I'm doing the vegetarian) is tasty and mostly easy to prepare. I enjoy the low-fat nature of the recipes. I never thought I'd enjoy salt-free cooking so much.Negatives:- The biggest negative is that the vegetarian menu is very deficient in calories. After feeling grumpy and wiped out for two days in a row, I plugged the menus for yesterday and today into FitDay and found out that yesterday's menu was only 505 calories, and today's was 650. I have read that it is not safe for women to go below about 1200 calories. I haven't run any of the other days or the regular menu (though it looks a little more substantial). I suspect that the person who created these menus was a non-vegetarian chef, and not a nutritionist. Unfortunately, this means that I am going to have to create my own menus, trying to follow the minimal guidance given in the book. I will use many of the recipes, but will add things like quinoa and more sweet potatoes, etc.- There is no guidance given for beverages. There is only minimal guidance given for what to eat after the 30 days.- Instructions for the exercises sometimes differ between the book and the video.- It is not always clear whether a ""rep"" includes doing both sides (as in some of the ab crunches) or just one side.Feedback about the different parts:Mat Workout:This is my favorite part. It's challenging, and I can feel progress here. I would love it if the video gave time for at least 30 reps though, so that I wouldn't have to keep hitting the pause button while I finish. I imagine that after I work past 30 reps I'll not need the video.Dance Workout:This part is fun. It's not great on carpet, because of twists and turns. But I've been modifying a little.I am glad that she just models rather than talking to us. It's like many dance classes I've had, and I know that it means that I won't get tired of the DVD as fast as I have some of the others I've bought. Some of the editing is choppy, but this is usually at the end, where it seems like she's just being kind of random in a fun way. The only time it bothers me is when they have done an inexpert cut right after she starts another move that isn't really what comes next - so far this has faked me out every time. But I'm just doing my best to follow along, and after 3 days, I found myself able to follow most of it. It's also a little frustrating when she does an unpredictable number of repetitions before moving to the next move. Definitely letting go of getting it perfect.It would have been great if they didn't require you to go back to the menu between cardio workouts, particularly since the menu takes forever to complete its silly animation before offering its options. Even better would have been to also have recorded workout 1 and 2 twice, so that you could repeat as instructed without stopping the workout.Finally, the lyrics on the second cardio routine makes me cringe. There is not much voice, but what's there runs along the lines of ""I'm fragile"" and ""I don't want to feel"" - pretty much the opposite of healthy. I will be creating my own play list soon.Food:As I've said, the food is enjoyable, and I really like the freshness of it. It is mostly easy to prepare, and I have made substitutions for hard-to-find items like yacon syrup (since she said it has half the cals of maple syrup, I just substitute half the amount). I did find one silly recipe that wanted us to cook some kale and snow peas in 1 quart of veggie stock and then rinse it cold before sauteing in 1/4 cup of veggie stock. I cooked it in 2 cups (no problem), and didn't rinse it before sauteing. Then I saved the once-used veggie stock again. The dish turned out great, and I didn't waste anything.I seriously question the caloric content. I don't know if the regular menus are as limited as the vegetarian, but 600-ish calories a day is about 1/2 the minimum recommended threshold for women. I will be modifying this.Overall:I think that this program will be most enjoyable for those who like to dance more than they like to run or do other athletic pursuits. I really appreciate that the recipes all call for natural foods, and a lot of fruits and vegetables. This has been sorely lacking in other programs I've found.In 5 days, I have lost just over 6 pounds. I think this is probably more than is safe, particularly since I am not that overweight (I'm 5'8"", and weighed 165 lbs when I started). I imagine, however, that when I start eating enough food, that I will feel less grumpy and will enjoy the exercises more.If not for the food issue and the video issues, I would have given this 5 stars. I think with a little more care on the part of the publishers, this book could have been a classic. I think that with a moderate effort to adjust to the imperfections, it can still be really helpful. Tracy is definitely on the right track with most of it.Update (day 7): I'm using FitDay to enter all the food for the day. Then as I go, I'm occasionally upping the vegetable servings. For dinner, I will have enough quinoa to make up the difference (until I get to about 1200 calories). Also, on every meal but the chocolate stuff, I'm just eating the full recipe if it makes more than one portion - this is an easy way to get more calories without doing any more work. Using this method, I am pleased to say that I'm not hungry, tired, or irritable today. And it looks like today (day 7, veg) I will only have to add 1/3 cup (before cooking) of quinoa, since I ignored the suggested portion sizes. I love the food on this plan - it has all been very tasty. I work at home and am used to cooking, so it's not too bad for me, and I love the freshness of the recipes. Now that I'm getting enough to eat, I'm a happy camper. Working out was much easier today.Update (day 9): Having entered the data for several days now, I am downgrading this to 3 stars. The daily suggested calorie intake continues to hover between 500-650 calories (except on the days with the choco-chestnut pudding which is about 400 cals all by itself). My conclusion is that this must be intentional. *Given the fact that extreme calorie reduction is not explicitly mentioned as a strategy by the author*, I find this to be deceitful. She promotes healthy, low-fat, natural food, which I commend, *but the menus do not allow enough of it*. We are only told to follow them explicitly, eating a little more if we are still hungry. She fails to mention that *no one* should be limiting themselves to the suggested menu.I am still grateful for the recipes - they are tasty - but I'm knocking her down for being disingenuous. I write this hoping that it will help others know what they are getting into. Add quinoa, oats, corn tortillas, brown rice... get those calories up to a healthy level. Starving yourself is counter-productive. I am extremely disappointed that she was not honest about what she was doing, particularly as she asks us to follow her plan to the letter."

339656,0,"Have been using this pedometer since receiving it but am having problems. I've followed the instructions for usage and set it up correctly, but it doesn't seem to be keeping an accurate step count. I've been comparing with it an old pedometer I know to be accurate, and it's coming out on the losing end.The instructions say it can keep count if it's in your pocket, so that's where I've been keeping mine since it's not always practical to have it on a waistband. On the waistband, it seems accurate, but in my pocket, it's off by at least a couple thousand steps every day (a higher count than my old one). A friend has surmised that it needs to stay upright to keep a correct count, but there's no good way to do that, at least not that I've found yet. If anyone can suggest how to make it work accurately being carried in a pocket, I'd like to know.Otherwise, I like the features, especially the aerobic step count. I'm sure it is a great tool when it works accurately and on a consistent basis, but I just haven't gotten it to that point yet."

438880,1,I used the stove for the first time last week. It functioned exactly as I expected. It was easy to adjust for a really low flame to fry eggs and boiled water fast when at I turned the heat up. Glad I bought this one . I read some reviews on some cheaper stoves not being able to hold a low flame so I spend a few dollars more and got this one and am glad I did.
158129,0,Its a nice scope for the money. Its for a .22 rifle so don't expect an amazing scope. Reticle is clear. Has nice eye relief too. This scope does come with rings but they are really bad. After 50 rounds of steady shooting the rings loosen and slide on the mount as well as on the scope it self. The screws for the rings were a joke. Even with the proper size screwdriver the screw head was deforming. So my advice is to not use the rings and get some better ones.

The pockets are right in the middle of my hips and because of tightness will be hard to use. Except for in that area they are comfortable to wear but unfortunately will not be ordering this sweatpant again cause of size issues. I did order a large and anything bigger and I would be swimming in them but they are just a bit to tight. Will stick with purchasing sweat pants at local stores from now on to assure comfort. Shipping from this company was fast and had no issues with them.

It's very comfortable and durable. The stripes on the sleeves go all the way around the sleeve. I was comparing it to my Polamalu jersey I got at a department store, paid 40.00 there for it, and those stripes only cover the front of the jersey. This one is much nicer! The fabric it's made out of isn't cheap.I have a few other jerseys and this one is the highest quality jersey I have. I've enjoyed it and gotten lots of compliments on it.

55386,2,"We purchased the Skuut after reading reviews and closely examining the competition (primarily the Likeabike). First, the good: bike assembles easily, looks cute, and rides fast and true. The bad: it started falling apart within weeks, to the point of becoming completely unsafe. Our child is on the small side, just turned three, is 36 inches tall and weighs under 30 pounds. I can't imagine how a heavier child could ride one of these. As much as our child loved it, it just wasn't safe. We were able to send it back even after the 30 day period (way to go, Amazon!) and replaced the Skuut with the Kettler Sprint. Even though it doesn't look as cool, the Kettler is so much sturdier. The resale value will be higher too, since Kettler is such a well known quality kid's bike builder."

This product almost eliminates the noise even when I have my racks on. Buy this product here, forget about REI. They want $75 for it.

61507,0,"I was so happy to see a BPA free version of these bottles, and was given one for Christmas last year. I use it every day--love the holder thing, and like the design, but... Right after I got it, the little plastic thing that helps you flip up the rubber bite thing broke off. I'm hard on my bottles, which is why stainless steel doesn't work for me--it gets all bent up. So of course when I drop my bottles or bump them around the bit, the straw gets dislodged easily. I frequently have to open the thing and reach my hand in to reattach the straw. Not sure this is always totally sanitary. As mentioned earlier, the shape makes it fall out of every cupholder in every car--pretty annoying especially because it's not totally water tight!! Also, water does pool at the top with even the slightest pressure changes. I frequently end up with a small water puddle on my lap. Finally, a minor sort of funny thing is that if anyone wants to share your water, it's a little weird for them to have to bite down and all that... unless they unscrew it and then you have the possibility of a dislodged straw again... I wouldn't get this again. It's not such a big deal for me to tip the bottle to drink out of it."
496776,1,"I am so happy I purchased this machine. Have used it about 8 times without one problem. I did a lot of research and chose this one because of the weight. I am a healthy 50 something female 3.0 player and wanted something i could haul around. I am able to take it in and out of my SUV easily. I am so glad I did not buy one of the other heavier ones as this is about all the weight I could handle. I was concerned about the 60mph ball speed thinking i needed a much faster one. I have yet to crank it up to the highest speed. What a workout this machine gives. It lobs, oscillates and spits them out as fast or slow as needed. I love practicing my volleys with the oscillator on. You will have to move the machine half way into the court for the oscillator. Love the lob feature to practice my overheads. Though the machine holds 250 balls, I use 150 as I am frankly glad to have the break time to pick up the balls. I practice my serves in between. I can't attest to how it will be in the future mechanical wise but i have not had some of the problems others have without them working from the first try and spending twice the money. The battery on mine lasts 2 hours and it has never died on me playing yet. It is a great tennis partner! love it!"

These gloves shipped as promised and it does say XL on the tag but I could just barely get my mitts into them! This AM I decided to give it a go anyway, thinking, ""oh, the gloves are probably supposed to be this tight so as to allow for expansion after I work up a sweat."" NOT!!! Holy crap, I did 15 reps on my lat machine and I lost the feeling in all 10 fingers! I stopped right then and there and spent the next five minutes trying to get the things off my hands! I'm going to return them if I can and try their XXL gloves. The company is based in California so I have to wait until 10AM EST to call their customer support line. I'm going to ask them who the ""men"" are that they use as benchmarks for sizing their equipment. I mean if this glove is an XL I wonder who could possibly fit into the Small?"
215562,1,I love to use this Bingo cage. The best part is the large plastic tray for the balls. The large number balls fit into their numbered spots and do not roll around. The cage is large and steady. Each row of balls are different colors and easy to read the numbers that are engraved on them.

278358,0,"I bought this pack for 1 and 2 night quick backpacking trips, when going with another person. It has enough space for most of the things you would need when spliting a 2 person trip with somebody else. I fit a 2 person 3 season tent with ground tarp and rainfly, Jet boil GCS, 3 liter water pouch, 1/2 the food, a change of clothes, a water purifier, 2 1 liter bottles in the side pockets, a blanket, and a bed roll lashed to the bottom ( a lot for a small overnight pack). I was amazed that it all fit! After mounting up and walking down the 6 flights of stairs of my apartment and then the 3 blocks to the subway, I began to try to adjust the pack for comfort. I spent the next half hour fidling with the straps and adjustments to find something that was half way comfortable. It only got worse, and we ended up canceling the trips, because it was impossible to get the adjustments right.Instead of giving up on it, I looked for other uses. Now, I use it when going to the grocery store or shopping around town, and it's great!The straps are too thin for anything over 15 to 20 pounds, and the waist belt only has padding for half of my hips. But, the cinch straps help reduce the size quite nicely.It's also perfect for a carry on, as I can carry 3 to 4 days worth of cloths with no problem.It might be good for climbers or ultra-lighters who aren't carry much weight, but I would stay clear of it if you're carrying anything over 20lbs."
484463,1,"It was easy to put together ,low profile, but while using it there was a noise comming from inside the right side cover,which is already assembled from the factory,I loosend the screws that secure the covers and placed a small piece of foam at the top of the right cover where it rests against the post, then tightend the screws.This moved the right cover out just enough to keep the belt from rubbing on it. Since then it has been just fine. For those comments about being too easy to pedal,they must have improved that feature because ours is on the lowest setting and not that easy .When first using ,could only go 4 to 5 min.It took about 7 to 10 days to work up to 10 to 12 min,and it's still on the lowest setting.Outside of that rubbing belt problem everything has been fine."

Portable, if you mean around your yard, ok, I wouldnt take this to the park or beach. Porcelan coated grates, I have my doubts. A rotisserie- not even. Beer can chicken youll have to play with. Smoking roasts, and chicken thats on you to figure out. If you wanted a sophisticated BBQ this aint it, if you just want to cook steaks, burgers, sausages, pre-cooked ribs and chicken, and roast veggies, this is a perfect BBQ. For this ammount of money I would have expected more, but this is what I bought, so I have learned to live with it. So for everything this BBQ lacks, its back to my charcoal Weber."

341938,0,"The shipper/manufactures was fine and this arrived quite quickly, the issue we have is with the actual product.The product itself is sturdy and holds up fine under use. The issue is that the outer cover, which protects the inflatable part, is not smooth enough so while it does slide down the hill, it does so quites l o w l y. We would suggest spraying the cover with Silicone Spray or some such to help it slide better on the snow."
376194,2,"I searched high and low for a bicycle rack that would keep my two bikes (commuter and road) tidily and securely tucked against a wall in my apartment. Given my space options and lath and plaster walls (impossible to find a stud in) this gravity model appealed. It took me two tries to get this product - the first one came with metal tubes that were cut to the wrong lengths so that it wasn't even possible to assemble it (one ""leg"" was about a foot shorter than the other). So I exchanged it for another of the same model. Alas, it does not have screws for the arms that cradle the top tube (unlike the one pictured on Amazon) - it relies on o-rings to hold the spiral ends of the arms in place. I was worried whether the replacement stand will actually hold bikes securely.Sure enough, three months later the o-rings have snapped and the rubber coating on the hooks that hold the bikes have started to peel. My commuter bike gets taken on and off the rack 5 days a week, and the road bike 1-3 times a week. I did not expect this sort of use to be beyond what the rack can handle, and I'm disappointed that this otherwise nice design includes such shabby materials."

422845,0,"Three words of advice before installing these: get lock nuts. I learned this lesson the hard way.I installed these as replacements for a set of strap toe clips I had on my bike for fifteen years. After install and three rides, a fourth was cut short when my wife discovered one of the bolts and nuts was missing from the left toe clip. The companion bolt and nut were loose. I realize the nuts should be periodically checked and tightened, but after three rides?Rather than replacing just the missing bolt and nut pair, I went to my local hardware store and bought four stainless steel sets of a longer hex bolt, a washer that expands the nut head to the same diameter as the original bolt, and a nylon (nyloc) lock nut. The remaining original pairs I stashed for future use. After reinstalling the toe clips, I learned that having two washers on the bolt head side or something thicker (nylon, perhaps) would better emulate the original bolt head. Otherwise, it all locked down as hoped.I will post an update down the road after I've had a chance to thoroughly test this retrofit."
331346,1,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas. We will use it in the spring, as we still have snow on our deck. (North Idaho). It looks terrific and we know the brand is a good one.

478661,1,"I overpronate moderately. I bought these primarily to control my overpronation. So far it has done it's job well. I used to have severe shin splint while running. Now after having used these shoes for over a month, my shin splints have greatly reduced. It fits great and supports my ankle well. The slight discomfort in my ankle immediately after running is completely gone after running in these shoes.By the way I am about 145 lbs with a small built. I run about 10 miles weekly at under 8 mins a mile."

After having not too much luck with thePressure Switch for Red LasersI bought for this laser sight, I eventually gave up and reattached the original switch. I attached it to my WASR 10/63 and tried to sight it in using the allen wrench that came with it, only to find out that even the tiniest adjustment sent the red dot flying across the target. I shifted the little adjustment screws back and forth for about a half hour until I eventually gave up and threw this piece of crap directly into the garbage. This sight was a colossal waste of time. At least I got a couple of decent allen wrenches out of it."

137390,0,"The opening mechanism is slick and effective without coming off as automatically scary or threatening when used sensibly. I think this knife could be considered a good safety item for someone that spends a lot of time in a boat, air plane, or pretty much any vehicle. If you are ever caught in a situation where you only have one hand/arm available and you need to cut something, like if you were in an accident and needed to cut a seatbelt off but its holding down one arm, this would be the knife to have, and its small enough to always be near and not take up a lot of space or add a lot of weight."

451888,0,"There is nothing wrong with this wheel, it works fine however it started to get surface rust right away. I do sometimes keep my bike outside only a few blocks from the beach in Florida so some rust is to be expected, however it still had more rust on it after a week than did my other wheel after months of the same environment. Without knowledge of another wheel that won't rust, I would probably buy this again."

399140,0,"These polarized sunglasses really do effectively cut out a lot of glare to help me see more comfortably. They have a wrap-around design that helps them to conform very snugly to the contour of my face - I couldn't ask for a more comfortable fit. The rubberized grips near the tips of the arms help these glasses to stay on securely.These shades look sporty and sexy but not overly flashy. They are thus perfect not only for your outdoor actvities such as biking, but for everyday wear as well. I got the frame with the tortoise design - beautiful! It is actually a bit darker than it appears in the picture on the product page.They come with a protective semi-hard case and a microfiber cloth. The case has a hook for attaching to your belt loop, backpack, etc.I thought these were the best glasses I had ever owned. But, alas, after just a month, one of the lenses popped out of the frame even though I took very good care of these glasses by returning them to the case when I wasn't wearing them. Maybe there would be better quality control if these Bolle glasses were still made in France instead of China? Anyway, it was back to my trusty five-dol1ar Wally World ""Berkeley"" sunglasses.---These polarized sunglasses are functional, attractive, and comfortable but not very durable."
457760,1,"When I first got this, I thought is was kind of small and light for the money. It fits over the head so that is almost does not cover your ears, as most other ski hats do. In that way, it is kind of short or small. However, I finally got used to it and find that it has enough coverage - barely. I like the fact that it is so lightweight and the color black is perfect because it can match my melon color ski jacket since melon in ski hats is hard to find. It would also be a great hat for backpackers or cross country skiers in the winter time since it is so light. It is warm enough being fleece, but does not provide any degree of water resistancy. Also, if you want insulation when getting wet or out in snowy weather while you are sweating, then you should probably go with wool instead of this fleece hat because the wool will insulate when wet. The only drawback with wool is that it is scratchy, which is why they often provide fleece linings to the wool ski hats."

Otherwise the fleece has a nice material and nice look to it but it is not doing what it is supposed to (keep me warm) & also as others have mentioned in the posts here it runs a size larger (i bought an L but should have gotten an M - for all my other stuff i have Ls)Hope this helps."
465820,1,"We bought this bike in February, and we love it. Even my 11-year old enjoys working up a sweat on it. It is easy to set up and use, and it's small, moveable, extremely quiet and very comfortable. I have never liked regular/upright exercise bikes as they aren't comfortable for me to ride for very long - this recumbent bike is perfect. I can easily get a good cardio workout in and not feel guilty about watching TV!The only complaint I have is that the packaging is terrible - the first bike we received was damaged. The box didn't hold up to cross-country shipping. Amazon sent another one after a couple of calls, and sent UPS to pick up the old one. The new one was also damaged, but only slightly. Amazon's price is $200 less than our local fitness store."

2374,1,"I bought the ball with the Isokinetics Inc. Exercise Ball Base and it works great as a replacement for my desk chair. I feel that I can tell the difference and that it is strengthening my core and giving a little extra definition to my abs. It definitely helps me with the back aches I was having before. I feel way better about my day sitting on this ball. With the base, I am never concerned about stability, although it took a small adjustment period (a couple of days) and a little bit of soreness to get used to it. I recommend this for desk sitters! I was considering going for a smaller ball (65cm) but ultimately chose 75cm. I am really glad that I did. I am 5'6"" and the 75cm height is perfect and in fact possibly a bit low."
35255,0,"I got the Urban Rebounder to keep me motivated over the winter when running outside isn't always an option. So far it has served its purpose and it provides a good low impact workout. There are some things that aren't so great, though. I looked through the DVD collection for the ""beginner"" workout only to find that there was no such thing. I had to jump right in and all I can say is that I hope I'm doing the basic bounce correctly because sometimes I feel as if I'm a bit off. The workouts are fun, but some of the instructors can be annoying and it makes my exercise time less enjoyable. Setting up the trampoline was easy, but I have yet to fold it up again. I can't get it to close, and didn't want to risk injury from it snapping shut. More of an inconvenience than anything else."

374547,0,"Since Amazon for some reason denied my first attempt to post this, here we go again. Short, sweet and to the point. The derailleurs ARE NOT SORA MODEL they are the 2300 series. Forge actually admits this on their website for the front derailleur, although it says ""FD 2300 (Sora) front derailleur"". For the rear it simple says ""Sora 8 Speed"" Therefore I highly doubt their claim that the dual control levers (STI Shifters) are Sora level also. More than likely 2200/2300 series also. Is it a huge deal? Probably not. The 2300 series was introduced in 2009 and is pretty much the high end of the 2200 series and is COMPATIBLE with the Sora group (3300 series). For those who don;t know, for Shimano (road bike line) the lowest group is the 2200 followed by the 2300, then Sora, Tiagra, 105, Ultegra then Dura-Ace. If someone promises me the Sora series on a bike, guess what, that's what I expect. So decide for yourself if a company that uses deceptive marketing is someone you want to do business with.If you can get past the lies, the bike is pretty nice. Assembly was fairly easy. I had to disconnect and reroute the front brake cable since it was interfering with the derailleur cable. And both derailleurs had to be adjusted If you don;t have a presta valve adapter you'll need one of those (about $1). As far as the one size fits all. My wife and I are both 5' 7"" and we can straddle the crossbar with about 2"" to spare. So I'm thinking 5'5"" might be the absolute minimum height, and I wouldn't want to be taller than 5'10"". The bike frame is very small. The bike is fairly light, rides and shifts admirably and will suit my wife's needs. She just got into biking and instead of spending seven hundred on an entry level Trek, and perhaps finding it hanging from the garage ceiling a year from now. I felt spending four hundred was a big more ""reasonable""."

408881,0,"I recently purchased a set of Bowflex 552 Dumbbells during Black Friday and immediately realized the need for a stand to place my weights on. Unfortunately, I could only find one stand that was compatible with this dumbbell set (I like having options to compare between).One comment I have read on other reviews was that the stand was hard to install and the instructions were not adequate - I had no issues with the either the installation or instructions. It took me about an hour to setup.Pro:-Will save your body from bending over to pick up weights-Sleek lookCon:-CostConclusionYou have to have something to place your weights on, and other than making a shelf or putting them on some type of table/stand, this is the best thing out there. Recommended if you can afford it.FYI - If you don't care about the look of your gym, you can simply place these weights on top of the styrofoam that the dumbbells are packed in. Doesn't look good and not as sturdy, but it did the trick for the first month before I caved and bought this stand."

The handle is easily pulled apart making it easy to simply break the lock off (who cares? if they're stealing your gun they'll just take the case too and deal with the lock later)But the plastic is cheap and appears to be brittle. it's a good carry case, not a durable case at all."

393527,0,"In my more than fifty years of training and teaching the martial arts and law enforcement tactics I have purchased numerous training knives over the years. This straight blade rubber knife is one of the models I used in my classes. I found them to be fairly durable, but after years of use the paint came off and some of them ripped apart. They also lose their firmness after a lot of constant use.For some basic knife handling and knife defense tactics these straight rubber training knives are okay but they are not the best training knives on the market. This is why I only gave them three stars. It all depends on what you want to spend and the type of knife training you intend to use these rubber knives for, but they are reasonably priced.In conclusion, if you are looking for a cheap straight rubber training knife you may want to check this model out to determine if it fits your particular training needs.Rating: 3 Stars.

235638,0,I bought this as a test platform for my new Taurus Tracker 627 in .357. It is made for a 6 inch barrel mine is 4. I also have a Uncle Mikes size 2 which I use for my 3 inch barrel Model 85 in .38 Special. I bought the size 3 thinking it might allow the 627 to fit lower in the holster. Quite the opposite. It is not by much but in the size 2 the trigger guard on the 627 goes down further into the holster than the size 3. Not but much but you do see less of the trigger guard.The size 3 is butt heavy and tends to cause the lower end of the holster to stick out forward.

305234,0,"This Seiko watch makes a great gift. It comes in a gorgeous deep blue box with the watch wrapped around a little white Seiko pillow. The watchface is every bit as impressive as the photos indicate. Unfortunately, the metal band is no where nearly as sexy as the photos would have you believe. The photos show a clear difference between the shiny and matte metal parts. In real life, the difference isn't so obvious. To be completely honest, outside of the fantastic watch face, I think this watch comes off looking a little cheap. So when you fall in love with the watch based on the photos (like I did), don't be disappointed when the watch you receive isn't quite so spectacular."
499199,2,Looking at the picture you would expect that you are getting a set. You get one short piece 12 x 6 and nothing else ... no instructions ... nothing. You can get the same item on bodytrends website for 9.95. What a waste of money!

Unfortunately, it's the simplicity of the game that works and TW doesn't have it.

464453,0,I have used a few different suspension devices over the years and this one comes in the middle of the pack. I really like the handles but the metal piece is large and very uncomfortable to throw in a back pack and take on a jog. It sets up easily on a bar but I have not tried the door mount as of yet. I'm curious because I weigh about 215 pounds and that is a lot of force. When I used it on a Squat Rack that was unsecured I added a few 45 pound plates to the base of the rack to keep it from tipping. I f you use this at home great if you plan on traveling or doing some strength training after a run I would look elsewhere.

45240,1,"My lock came with the lock cylinder, but I ended up switching it out anyway so that all of the Thule locks on my car would have the same key.This lock is good for one thing- making sure your hitch accessory (in my case a bike rack) does not come off of your car. $30-$40 is alot to pay up front, but the piece of mind is worth it. I don't mind that I had to buy it separately, some people won't use it and that's ok.I do like the fact that the bolt that comes with it is long enough for 2' or 1.25' hitches and secures both equally well. I'll be able to use this lock for anything, not just a Thule accessory, so that makes the money well spent.This product did not get a full five stars because I think $30-$40 is too much money for a lock when one can get a sturdy combination lock of similar construction (but no good for hitch securing) for $10 shipped or less in a local hardware store."
397214,1,"This is a great device in terms of functionality and due to the zip-tie mounting option it fits thicker handlebars and forks (my bike is a Cannondale Synapse with a carbon fork). I agree with some of the other reviewers that whoever authored the instructions should get fired. They are in diagram form only and it took me forever to figure out in which sequence I was supposed to push buttons to get through the set-up. I am pretty computer/tech savvy but this was certainly a new level of a challenge. Once done, this unit has been great. I deducted one star because of the manual only, not because of functionality."
140746,0,"I've used EA Active for two days now and wanted to chime in with a few thoughts. Most importantly, I definitely *feel* the workouts (was a little sore this morning from yesterday's) and I expect that by continuing the 30 day challenge I will benefit from the exercise. That *is* the most important, and so for the cost of a month or two at the gym, this title should be helpful.However, there were a number of user interface issues that were frustrating, not because they were disasters but because it didn't need to be that way. For instance, when you move from exercise to exercise in the 30 day challenge, some exercises require the nunchuck in your left hand while others require it tucked into a pocket on the leg strap. The software does tell you which mode you need to be in, but it doesn't do so intelligently: e.g., if you go from one exercise to another where the nunchuck position doesn't change, I don't need to know about it, but if you go from chuck-in-hand to chuck-in-pocket, it's very easy to miss the notice on the screen (which is timed, not triggered by a button) and you can begin the next exercise in the wrong position. Putting the nunchuck into the pocket isn't hard, but it isn't smooth. You can't help but notice a number of similar areas where things could have been programmed a bit better.The leg strap, for me, was slightly troublesome. If I make it tight enough to stay on my leg for all of the exercises, it's rather tight and I feel it squeezing my hamstring. If I loosen it so that it doesn't cramp the muscle, then it tends to fall down. Perhaps a different pair of sweat pants would help. [UPDATE: After 4 workouts, I continue to have leg strap problems, especially on all of the ""jump"" exercises, where no matter what I do or what I wear, the leg strap falls off mid-exercise.]If you use the balance board, the video instructions for events like roller blading suggest that you to watch the instructions for without the balance board first, but then don't give you a way to do that. Some exercises seem a little risky -- doing high kicks during boxing while standing on the balance board seems like a recipe for future injury, but I guess no risk no reward...Interestingly, both days 1 and 2 have you do biceps curls, but no focused triceps exercise (though I guess shoulder press does include some triceps work). [UPDATE: After 4 days of exercises, the biceps have been worked each day.]For several of the exercises in today's workout, I found the nunchuck cord to be a problem. With the knee lifts, you end up whipping yourself with the cord when you bring your arms down. With the shoulder presses, the cord can hit you in the face unless you keep your arms forward a bit. Doing a backhand tennis racket motion with your right hand while holding the nunchuck in your left doesn't feel right as the cord isn't long enough to allow a full swing.Compared to Wii Fit, I think that Wii Fit was a *lot* more fun, as I was compelled to play some of the balance games for hours at a time. After working out on EA Active, I was ready to be done -- that's not a bad thing, it is a workout after all, but it's not really a *game*. Wii Fit tracks your weight, which is helpful, while EA Active doesn't (surprisingly). Moving from exercise to exercise is smoother on EA Active since you have pre-programmed workouts ahead of time (on Wii Fit, it's rather a drag moving from exercise to exercise).In summary, I think this will be an effective exercise tool, which is what it's supposed to be. I don't give it a higher rating because of a number of user interface issues that could easily have been avoided and because of the imperfect use of nunchuck and leg strap.[UPDATE: After 4 days of exercises (1 day of rest), I am more frustrated with this software and wonder about the wisdom and safety of some of the exercises. Today's workout was very ""jump"" focused, with lunge jumps, squat jumps, and roller blading jumps (be careful with your knees). The system had a hard time detecting my jumps accurately. If you raise your hands too high on the jump, you'll pull the nunchuck out of the sleeve. Some of the motions are artificial (e.g., pointing your hands upward at the top of the shoulder press) so that the wiimote can detect a complete movement. In boxing, the success of your punch seems to depend a lot on how hard you ""snap"" at the end of the punch, which seems bad for your arms. The coach can go in one second from ""Your form is a little off, this exercise owns you"" to ""your really nailing this exercise"" in the next second, same exercise. I would swear I heard the video instructions for the curl-shoulder-press say, ""At no time should you allow the shoulder to come out of the socket."" Really! And two seconds into the warmup ""walk"", the coach exhorts ""Nice!"" I mean, I'm just walking for 2 seconds, I don't need the encouragement yet...]"

Should have waited for wii motion+Needed more sports & less boring running & boring gym toning.A second or 2 lag on avatar mimicking your movementVery little skill/thinking is involved, it's all about mindless moving.Many sports like target boxing, catching, basketball passing, etc. are always the same, left, right, left, right... or left, center, right, left center... no randomness so within 1 play you know what comes next.Not many workouts use the balance board use, usually only 1, MAYBE 2 workout per sport, such as 2 boxing, 2 dancing, 1 baseball, 1 basketball, 1 skating, 1 volleyball & 1 tennis. all except kickboxing & skating use the balance board for stepping out/lunges.All sport workouts have you against machine & hitting towards large targets, nothing more.Sports:Dancing -It's mostly lift arm up, side, down. Occasional ""churn the butter, shopping cart, lasso, start the lawnmower"" silly named movements. Timing is very forgiving, wii fit step is more fun, skill.Inline skates - only have jumping w/o balance board based on timing or balance board lifting a leg for several seconds about 6x, too boring/easy.Basketball - picking up a ball & passing requires no aiming whatsoever. Shooting only requires effort, not aiming either. Several wii games like game party & carnival games that prove you can do aiming recognition.Baseball - catching/throwing is good, batting is almost exactly the same as wii sports, but even better as it's faster. although with batting, your forced to keep the nunchuck plugged in which is a pain, I have to pause & miss the first shot hurrying to shove the nunchuck in my waistband. the pitching against bottles was poorly done as you have to wait for aiming crosshair to move in figure 8s to the right spot, they shoudl have used IR pointing.Boxing/Kickboxing - the targets were fun, but too predictable, always l/r, l/r, no randomness. there are almost more workouts duing mindless fast punching the heavy bag then anything else. the kicking/knee use on bag was great, but only on 1 balance board workout.Tennis - expects good timing on swings which is great, ball hitting racquet sound makes it easy to time your movements, has only forehand, backhand, overheat & smash, but where remote held doesn't matter anyhow, no aiming or movement control needed.Volleyball - bumping, setting, blocking & serving. Easy to do, boring since no aim involved, just course timing & effort.For control recognition issues:I noticed sometimes it was about timing in the upper/lower body toning, moving sooner then the trainer or too fast out of the movement/rep.I also had remote issues in upper body which I was able to fix w/changing my hand position (sometimes it's all about bending the wrist or which way remote is pointing), hence the included boring videos.For the nunchuck on leg issues, I had trouble, so I put the nunchuck in my hand during the exercise to test the sensitivity & realized it was much more sensitive then I thought the nunchuck had the ability to be. It really wants your leg to be perfectly horizontal to the floor, or very close.Overall, ok for those who get little exercise, only because of the feedback, dvds would be better for at home exercise otherwise since so easy to cheat. Eyetoy cam on the playstation 2 is better as it can ""see"" you, Your Shape when comes out in Nov. 2009 will have a cam & crossing fingers. Or else there is ALREADY a listing for EA Sports Active TWO. Those who bore easily when doing simple things will not like this game."
25707,0,"I debated whether to spend another $10 for a sturdier model after reading several reviews on this site.There is some assembly require: putting 4 nuts on 4 threaded ends and sliding the legs into their appropriate loops. Nothing anybody couldn't handle. I cranked mine to where I popped the ball cap off the nut, hoping this will alleviate the problems others have run into with screws coming loose. If not, then I'll zip-tie it. No problem.The legs fall out easily, but this is common to most ball hoppers. I wrapped some duct tape tightly around where the legs attach to keep them clamped in the hole... problem solved.The legs do not just pop into their locks to create the stand, and it takes a bit of muscle to hook and unhook them... but thank God. I'll call it plyometrics and never have to worry about the wind blowing the legs out from under my hopper anymore.Balls pop easily into the hopper during pickup.The biggest flaw I see is that the top latch doesn't secure very tightly. I foresee balls flying around the back of my truck without bending the latch in a little more or finding an alterative way.All in all, thanks for saving me a couple bucks Wilson."

I don't dive, I've never had to stab or cut anyone to defend myself and I can't really think of a reason to own this knife except for the fact that it looks cool.If you're a diver, you might find this useful. I don't know that I would depend on it to defend my life. Maybe the bad guy would stop what he's doing and say, ""Hey! Cool knife, man!"" and I could run away. I don't know.

382989,0,"I have owned this elliptical for 9 months and it finally broke (a third time) where I will not use it anymore. I used this machine for 45 minutes to 1 hour a day 4-6 days a week. I bought this machine because it was cheap and I wasn't sure I would use an elliptical enough to justify buying a more expensive one. If this became a dust magnet or clothes rack, I was only out a little over $100 if I ran it into the ground (which I did) and could prove to myself that I will indeed use an elliptical enough to justify buying a more expensive one.First off this machine was loud, I had to really crank up the volume on the TV to be able to watch TV while working out. I did not bother trying to fix the annoying squeaks or clanks. Eventually one of the bolts in the foot pedal stripped out. My husband who is a mechanical engineer had a buddy at a machine shop who custom made me a new bolt that would not strip out. Eventually the second bolt stripped out too. The metal frame also got a crack in it (which my husband's buddy welded back together for me). When the frame got a second crack, I gave up and decided that I would kick this one to the curb and invest in a more expensive, better quality elliptical.This machine did serve me as well as it helped me lose 30 lbs (Female 5/5"" went from 168 lbs to 138 lbs in a little over 3 months - but also modified my diet). It lasted a short while (2-3 months) before it broke. I was able to extend the life of the product by repairing it myself, but I guess most people don't have friends that can weld their machines or make custom bolts for when it breaks.Basically, I think this is a good ""trial"" elliptical to see if you will commit to working out at home. Other than that, it's cheap, so yes it will not last long and will fall apart soon and will have problems with noise, etc... If you can live with all of that, then it might be right for you. If you are a heavy duty exerciser and are trying to save money, spend a little more, as you will probably be disappointed with this product."

These are the exact same problems reported on other sites. Even these numbers are the same 02008 and 011. It was a good scale up to this point. This scale gets good reviews from folks who have had it less than a year, but look around at the reviews of some folks like myself who have had it longer and you'll find all the complaints/ reviews are very similar to mine. This scale has a one year warranty and after that it ""craps"" to bed.

My requirements were simple, I wanted a pullup stand with a VKR that could support at least 300lbs. Price was good, purchase on amazon for $150 with shipping included.You definitely get your money's worth with this piece of equipment. Assembly took about an hour, no issues. Nice and sturdy, supports my 250lb body with very little wobble. I only have a few complaints, first it is not 86"" inches high like it says in the description, by my measurement it was only about 82"". I am very tall, so those extra inches were important to me. The dip bars are also very wide. If you can do 15-20 dips, you may find you can only do 5-8 on this gear due to the width of the dip handles. That was not so important to me because it was not what I bought it for, but hopefully that info helps someone else.Other than that, I have zero complaints. I use it just about every day for pullups and VKR's. If you are a heavier person, pushing the 250lb. capacity on most pieces of similar gear, this may be the one for you since it has a 300lb. capacity.

The 6 year old did not have the initial coordination so i rode her around on it a couple of times and helped her with the throttle. After one week she too was a pro. As expected it does bog down a bit when going up-hill but on flat land it cruises. Both girls have thanked me numerous times for getting them this gift as they love showing off as they ride through the community."
87985,1,"This was ordered as a Christmas gift at the request of one of my sons whose brother attends Texas A&M University. I expected it to made of the perforated fabric that comes to mind when considering football jerseys, but was pleasantly surprised to receive a tightly woven fabric that will be more durable. It is exactly as it appears in the picture online and would be a welcomed gift for any fan. I especially like the size in that it seems to be wider than other bed covering I have purchased and allows for ample measurement to drape over the sides of the bed."
14040,1,Got this for my man for Christmas and he loved it!!!!!It is together and highly detailed!!!!! I am looking forward to get him another semi.
458206,1,"I bought this as my first longboard and love it. My only issue s with it was the small wheels that came on it, but these were quickly replaced and it improved the stability greatly. it also sits a little high, but its easy to get used to. Handles well and is easy to pump on."
95098,0,Great if you are into fast and intense workout. I lasted only ten mintues. I knew what I was getting into but wanted to try it any way. I gave it to a younger friend who really enjoyed it.
402553,0,it is little to heavy in my pocket but is a real nice knife bla bla bla bla bla bla
464637,0,i bought this a christmas present and i wil say i was disappointed. the chip holder and the trays are pretty small and it's made out of cheap plastic. i would not recommend it to anybody
133542,0,"they take forever to ship! ugh!! its been 2 days & they still haven't shipped this item. i bought something else the same day & it was ship the same day i bought, unlike this one!"
160878,0,Nice looking but heavy. Takes awhile to get a good wind. Keeps fair time.
155107,0,"The hardware that they supply is cheap and I don't recommend using as they are cheap and aluminum rather than steel. As a result I couldn't turn the Allen bolt making it unsafe. So I had to drill them off and replace so that it felt safe for my kid to be on the back. Other than that, the rack is fine and is compatible with the copilot kids seat."
406376,2,"Purchased this product just about a year ago.One thing that I did not like was that it did not have the ratchet mechanism to tighten the head strap, instead it had the style of hole and button that you find on cheap 'one size fits all' hat.The second thing I did not like is that it did not like to stay up and out of the way when you wanted to get a clean look at something, and there was no way to increase the stay up tension. You would lift the shield and it always flopped back down unless you tilted it all the way up, but then one size fits all strap was not strong enough to keep it on your head.Today I went out into my shop and the head band had split in two around one of the front pivot bushings. It failed just sitting on the bench, well at least it did not pop off in the middle of doing some work."
314114,0,"I bought this car for my 21/2 yr old grandson. He loved it but it was a little small for him. He has trouble using his feet to push the car, not much room to move his feet while sitting in the car. He loves the motor sounds, the fold down seat and driver door that opens."
477769,0,The construction is good - no problems there - but you'd better know how to use it when you receive it. There sure aren't any instructions!
453528,2,"I was mislead by the advertisement. The shorts are skin thin and don't have pockets in them. Quality it is ok for what they really are ... pijama shorts.Maybe it is my problem 'cause I am not a native English language speaker, maybe not."
125107,0,"This product is very cute I really liked it. The only thing I did not like was the weight, it is not very heavy so if you put it on a step or something you will have to brace it down. It does have holes at the bottom for the ground though which was helpful."
258991,1,"We purchased this along with an Intex pool, and I LOVED how quickly I was able to inflate the pool using this pump! It is easy to use, enough so that my two small children were able to help me. Then, when it came time to deflate the pool, it was SO much easier using the deflating feature. Inflating and deflating become a quick thing instead of a big chore. It comes with 3 different sized nozzles, too, which was necessary with the pool I bought. Great pump...I recommend it."
342765,0,"A nice little flash to go with your underwater digital camera. A bit basic, but fine for a first timer. More money will buy you more features with another flash, but this is fine for the money. comes with a mount and a nice case."
168130,1,"talk about getting every little spot in there, WOW! Great product, liked it so much, i also bought the Elite cleaning system for all my guns."
301539,0,The throw is a good size but not nearly as soft as I expected. It was a gift for my husband who is a huge Steeler's fan. I would not buy this product again.
326379,0,"First bore sight wasn't aligned properly and the laser struck the inside of the barrel before exiting the muzzle. The item was promptly replaced and the replacement worked as expected, until the batteries died after ten minutes. Ordered more batteries (more money for Amazon) and I hope to be able to finally use this item when they arrive. During the ten minutes it worked, I noticed that the laser was not particularly well focused. It appeared to be about the diameter of a golf ball at 25 yards, but you get what you pay for."
275432,0,"It is serving it's purpose and a decent product overall. Great for a pickup truck.Why I rated it a 3 out of 5 is that it comes with a bolt that needs to be tightened in the vehicle hitch.One can't just use the usual clip that we all use for connecting trailers, etc to our trailer hitch.That means that if you wish to use this hitch mount T on a van or suv it's a pain and time consuming to get into the back of your van or suv."
473985,0,"i like this jar, it's the right size, good looking and feeling shape. now to the reasons for 3 stars. the infuser is very shallow. the tea leaves are barely covered by water. i use high quality teas which expand significantly and absorb water so every time i opened the jar the leaves were only half in water. in the beginning i turned it upside down but the plastic taste from the lid wasn't good addition to the tea flavor. now i put the tea in the jar and pour it out into another cup through the infuser. i'm ok using my solution but i don't see any reason not to make infuser of the right size. Also that spill-proof thing you supposed to drink through has noticable plastic taste. all in all it's ok product but no reason for it not to be better."
133510,0,Item came with all the listed items on the package. but they need GASKETs.. as they leak like a sieve... I tried this on my water broom and I got soaked....... water spit in my face and all over me..Get some gaskets before trying this item.
360095,0,"this treadmill is good if you enjoy casual walking only, it's hard to run on it as you have to be holding on to handles at all times during running. the incline is fixed and non adjustable and the electronic device is very low quality and not functional. again, if you plan on using it for walking only, it is a great product, but if running is the intention, try some other product"
130351,0,"I should have paid more attention to how big it is. I envisioned it being more compact and something I could throw in a bag along with other beach things, but it is thick enough to require it being carried separately.Overall, we enjoyed using this on the beach, but I wish I would have purchased something more compact."
168390,1,"I bought the XXXL size in January, so I was able to wear it through much of a colder than usual winter in MO. It is heavier than average, but very comfortable and roomy. The zipper is top notch metal and was always easy to use, with a nice sized pull for use even with gloves on. An inside chest pocket on the left side (for 'righty' access) is quite large and deep. The outside pockets are also quite big. This sweatshirt is plenty for most colder days in moderate climates, and would provide a very substantial layer for use in the more frigid northlands. Construction is flawless with no loose or haphazard stitching or seams. Machine washed without a hitch. Absolutely no complaints, and highly recommended."
423630,1,"I got this bike 10 months ago. It is GREAT! It has been working very well. I'm 8 years old, and this bike is great for kids six years old and up. I haven't had any problems with it. I usually ride about an hour non-stop on a charge. I ride it on grass and concrete and it rides good on both. You won't be disappointed if you buy this bike. It is so cool!Alex - 8 years old"
72860,1,"I purchased several for my boyfriend. When new, they are a little big... But after washing, a perfect fit and comfortable."
224691,1,Great sweatshirt. So warm. Love the double-lined hoodie. After several years of wearing i still love it. It's not perfectly pill-free (that is after several dozen washes).
152973,0,"Granddaughter, age 7, is pleased that she can now shuffle the cards when it is her turn."
146857,1,this was a gift...He really likes this phone case it hold the phone in place and that's what was needed to hold it in place.
107298,1,Great shorts! Just the length that I have been looking for. Plenty of pockets and a great fit. Very good quality.
335241,2,Tracy says her plan is guaranteed to work. Eating very few calories and working out 2 hours a day (the premise of her program) will have that effect. But she also says to follow her plan to a T or else it won't work. Skip this book unless you plan on following her meal plans perfectly and working out 2 hours a day.
196734,1,My company has had these a couple of seasons now and love them. We use them to determine if it is safe to do high-rise window cleaning. If you want to know the average wind speed and the gusting this does the job.
352373,1,"This helmet is perfect - its light, great color and fits snug. It comes with several cushions already in the insider layer, but if you want to add more there are extra cushions in the box. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a great looking, light, and comfortable helmet."
412638,0,"The good:--Good looking watch (although will probably never use the feature that will allow you to blank off the digital display)--For the price it is a good quality watch, with a solid heft.--The indiglo is bright as advertised.Not bad, but a little irksome:--quite a thick watch and is best for someone with a big wrist--The digital numerals could be wider. I know they have to fit it within the confines of the circle, but the time is often obscured by the hour and minute hands. (It is just natural for one to look at digital first and foremost when given the option)--This may be my problem, but I still have a problem with getting all the functions to work--probably my biggest irritation.--The digital and the non-digital hands do get out of whack slightly with each other, but not a big deal.It is a gray lcd background, not white. still looks nice."
329324,0,this gun is ok. i dont think that it goes 380 fps. its more like 300. the battery takes a while to charge like all airsoft batteries. lastly the gun is not all metal yet it is quite heavy. i am not that big so the gun is a little hard to hold. in the end it is a good gun but it has its flaws like everything else in this world.p.s. it is priced to high i think
200549,0,"The arrow rest on my bow wilted away, so I decided to go cheap and buy this since I plan on getting a new bow next year. The self-adhesive works pretty well, if you look close at the picture you'll see the metal piece the arrow rests on. that actually pivots. in the package it has an extra self-adhesive pad, and 2 extra little sleeves that go over the metal piece."
351786,1,"This is a high-quality mirror, compared to other bicycle mirrors. The image is very clear. The wide-angle curve is a bit too much, which makes objects appear too small, and it is difficult to know how far away things are. Because of the large size, it gets bumped out of position a lot, but it is easily re-adjusted. Overall, a helpful safety item, everyone should have. Better than a mirror mounted to glasses or helmet."
206431,0,products are good but their return policy is bad. if a product is used at all you can't return it. how would you know it was bad unless you actually tried it?
109707,0,"I own many Under Armour products and I am happy with most of them, but I am disappointed with this product. I was really excited when I bought these. I was thinking ""Finally, underwear that won't be soaking wet after ten minutes of running in the sun!"" Well, in that regard, they held up to their promise. This bikini does keep the moisture away from your body. The problem is that they are constantly riding up. They are practically unwearable because of this. Whenever I wear these I am constantly pulling at them. Now, maybe I have an oddly shaped behind, or I run in some strange manner, but I feel that for the price they are charging they should have done research on how these might fit people who have these problems! Your money might be better spent on their thong... that at least has nowhere to ride up.I do own the proper size, for those of you who may be thinking that I am trying to stuff my booty into these, though I admit that they might have shrunk. I say this because after I wore these for the first time, I loved them so much that I bought a second pair... that doesn't sound like something an unhappy customer would do. So, if you do still plan on buying these after you've read my review DON'T put them in the dryer!"
101976,1,Came two days after I ordered it. Assembled in less then ten minutes. perfect for backyard putting and approach practice. Improved my game immensely.
125770,0,"I brought these as a cheap way to get into skateboarding. I eventually upgraded to some Venture SuperLite Lo's. I liked the cargo ones, but the weight is on the heavier side. They're about a mid truck. All in all they aren't bad, but I enjoyed the upgrade."
22309,1,We have an older boat and the steering was really bad we tried everything thing that we could think of and in a last ditch effort bought this and now our boat steers great! as i recall it didn't give us too much trouble during installation.
395846,1,"My wife and I have used a variety of swim goggles and have had mixed success with them. With the Speedo swim mask our search is over. The first time we put them on we both said ""Wow!"" The field of vision and visibility is so superior to goggles. When we went into the water we discovered the silicone seal is absolutely watertight. With goggles we have often had to readjust them after two or three laps. With the mask there was no need to adjust after ten laps. Wish we had ordered more on the Friday sale!"
507701,1,"Warning: Once you put these on you will not be able to put on any other sports shorts again.The best shorts on the Planet EARTH! I have owned a pair of these for over 5 years and still looks brand new. I wear them all the time I have to wear shorts, the beach, the courts the pool, in the house, cutting the grass, whatever!They are weightless, keep you cool, don't stick when you sweat, stretchy so they don't hold you back and stay on your waist. I play indoor/outdoor basketball primarily in these and won't play if I don't have these shorts.If you don't have these shorts and wondering ""really do I need to keep cool from the waist down"" the answer is: YES you do! I put on a pair of old ball shorts because I didn't have a clean pair to wear and instantly wanted to take them off, and then when I started to play you miss everything about them. I have thrown away my other shorts because I will never wear anything but these.Enough about the shorts not having pockets they are training shorts. Since when do you play any sports with your wallet and keys in your pocket?? The manufacture does not say they HAVE pockets and then you get it at home to find they don't have any.I also like to wear them all the time! Especially when run out the house to do quick errands but I have found out having pockets on sports shorts are terrible, the second I get out of my car everything falls out the pocket. Cell phones fall out while I'm sitting in my car or worst my wallet. Get a phone belt clip and tie the string to your pants, my pants wallet and my Iphone stays put.Warning: I don't dry them because they have little metal tips on the strings that always get caught between the rotating part of the dryer and twist the string up really bad. It happens every time my lady accidentally puts them in. Don't worry they dont need to be dried they dry really fast.Pros:Weightless: it really feels like your just wearing underwear but without the embarrassment or nothing if you're going commando ;)Keeps you cool: you feel evey breeze and doesnt feels as if you have a sauna in your pants, sweaty butt is never nice.Keeps color: never fades not even a little; I've even taken them in the pool.Durable: All my shorts still look new.Price: $24-$30 may seem like a lot but I've not thrown away one pair I bought and I have had my first pair for over 5 years.Fansionable: eventhou my lady doesnt like them, they are under armor who in sports doesnt wear under armor?Cons:If you have an erection there's no hiding it.ps:They should call these shorts the Fabreze-shorts because they make you feel so fresh."

209044,1,Been using it for about 3 weeks now and still love it. I haven't done many lower body exercises but it will work your upper body great!!! If I had to do it again I would have gotten a lower model since I haven't used the attachments yet. Would recommend to someone wanting to say in shape in 20-30 mins a day.

85195,0,The product had good qualities. The cooler arms and the storage pockets helped us keep the garbage off the river. They also offered an opportunity to carry items without too much effort. The only problem was the comfort of the back. It made you sit up very straight. By the second day I had put a little blow up pillow behind my lower back and it was way more comfortable. The bottom tube and the back should have seperate bladders so you can adjust the air in the back pillow. Over all not bad.
160347,0,"I bought these skates for my birthday skate night. I turned 35 and I like to skate once in a while and I was so tired of using rental skates. I also bought one size DOWN because the other reviews said to do so. They were right. I wear a 8 1/2 - 9 so I bought an 8 and it fit just right. The skates actually skated fine at the skate rink but I did notice that the wheels didn't give me the speed I wanted or the glide. I had to work harder to get the speed. While at the skating rink, I met the guy that taught my MOM how to skate. My mom (55) skates better (and more often) than me. And the guy looked at my skates and said it's a good body, and after messing with my wheels, he said the wheels and barron (skate talk) are CRAP! So he suggested I get new wheels if I really want to skate like I do... but that is going to run me about $115!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I might save up for it because I love to skate and I want to get better. So, the skates are nice, but I do not get the speed I wanted."

255328,0,"I had high expectations for this product, and so far, it has come up a little short. I do like the idea of a hygenic barrier between myself and the yoga mat, especially if you are using the mats at the gym or yoga studio. However, I find that the towel is not exactly ""skidless"". It slips around a lot more on the mat than I was expecting. I find it harder to really plant my feet and hold a pose than when using a mat alone. I still continue to use it, but I think I might just buy a new yoga mat for myself and skip the towel."
24458,1,Pumping up was a pain and I didn't believe the ball would inflate as far as the guide ribbon indicated... But it did. Very good for abdominal exercise... But go slow if you haven't done a sit-up in 10+ years!
168771,0,"the adjustable strap for the waist is nice, but the sash itself does not adjust. So it tends to fall off my shoulder when running/biking and I'm only wearing a tee or tank. If it had an adjustable clip on it, it would receive more stars from me. Until then, my one hand is busy trying to keep it on my shoulder.It will be nice when I have to wear more layers and am a little more ""bulky""."

287594,0,"I bought 10 different color pair of these gloves. I love all the fun colors, but the gloves showed significant wear after only one time.

79266,0,"My husband bought me a Columbia Fleece jacket awhile back (from Bass Pro Shop) and I wanted another one to wear around the house. When I opened this one I noticed that the fleece was alot softer and thinner. I also noticed that the Columbia logo was on the left side of the jacket and the logo on my original jacket is on the right. I don't know if that is relevant to anything, but the quality of this jacket is definately less than my original. I am not going to go through the hassle of a return because it is an okay jacket to wear around the house on chilly mornings. It came with a $50 price tag attatched and I know I would definitely not spend that much for this particular jacket."

19659,0,"adidas style and comfort are great as usual in this top. The material snags really easy though. Older Response tops had more reflective piping and a thinner fabric that was more ventilated (similar to jersey material). This fabric is not jersey, it's softer, fluffier but snags very easily. Still a great buy, just isn't as long lasting."

299733,0,The past reviews talk about buying it cheaper in other places. I too was confused when I saw what appeared to be the same product for considerably different prices. In examination of the description the cheaper one says it works on most GPS units except the 100 rino series.The more expensive topo says it will work on just a couple GPS AND the 120 and 130 rinos.Check it out before you buy?
240433,1,comfortable long sleeve shirt. I use them for night shirts and they allowed me to retire some old &#34;friends&#34;. I got the XXL but the sleeves weren't any longer. Wished they had a 2XLT.
14305,2,"These ones have no pockets! A small gripe in comparison to the following.. I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together. The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size, if you get my meaning. When I order LG, I want them all to be LG, regarless of what the label says. I have some that go down the my knees, others that are 4-6 inches above the knee.. No consistancy at all. They were made in a couple different countries (El Salvador, Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact),but measurements should be the same everywhere (I thought)."
75815,0,"The product works but not as good as I would like it too. I am an avid bike rider and I had to constantly reapply the spray otherwise my sunglasses would fog up. Most times it only fogs up around where the lenses meet the rim and not so much on the lenses where you need to see. But the protection doesn't last long, you have to clean your glasses the next time you want to use them. Otherwise they tend to get dirty very easily and will fog up instantly. I gave it three stars because of the price and the product works as advertise, only not to the extreme."

462522,0,first of all this gun is not 425fps. in the box it says it is 320fps and could not go through a aluminum can. if your planing on buyimg this gun first try to find a place were you can make it stronger. if you buy this gun use .20 gram bbs because it makes your gun a little bit stronger.

114917,0,"These are cut a little big, and that's pretty typical for a rain jacket. It feels rubberized to the touch, and does keep you very dry. There are air vents under the armpits small enough that they should't let water in-- great feature. There are also two huge pockets on the front to keep items you need to keep dry.The only thing I don't like about this jacket is that it makes a lot of plastic noise. If you're out in the rain, this doesn't matter, but any time it's not raining you're going to be ""loud"".If I am going to be wearing a jacket for rain purposes I would personally prefer the Columbia Omni-tech or Titanium Tech jacket. Far more stylish, quieter, and better ventilation, at more cost."

43339,2,I would not recommend this product. I bought it because it was advertised as suitable for snorkeling but the first time I used it it let in water. Fortunately I had put the contents in a sealed plastic bag as well so it wasn't a complete disaster. I also found the belt/fastening method pretty awkward and ungainly.

50031,2,"Just received the shorts tonight and went out for a quick one hour ride. The padding is thinner than anticipated and doesn't come up the back side very high - about mid-butt is all. It wasn't comfortable walking around in them as I always felt like they were out of place. On the bike, they felt much better. After the ride, I felt the raw, sore inner thighs I endured before I broke down and bought biking shorts (maybe not quite as bad). I'm comparing these shorts to a $45 pair I purchased at a national chain sporting goods store. Given the choice again, I would have spent the extra $10 and got something higher quality."

140160,2,"I think the workout exercises are great and kept me very interested with the different scenarios. It is very hard at first because there is a lot of squatting involved, but after a couple weeks I really noticed an improvement in my thigh muscles. My advice to anyone starting any kind of exercise program is to skip two days after your first day. Because it really hurts the day after... hurts a lot more the second day after... on the third day, it hurts about as much as the first day after, but you warm out of it and then can work out without having near as much after-workout pain.What I don't like about this DVD:You should be able to skip an exercise when you are in the middle of the workout. Only way to skip one is if you uncheck it from the list before starting. If you go back and uncheck it, the whole workout starts over.There is a lot of time wasted in intros to every exercise. You are forced to go through the ""show me how"" EVERY TIME... must ALWAYS click the plus to ""show me how"" and then click it again to skip to the exercise. There should be something to click to completely bypass the ""show me how"".If you are not holding position exactly and perfectly, it tells you to ""stand still"" and wait for up to a couple of minutes BETWEEN EACH REP before the exercise resumes. That is also one heck of a time waster. If I only have 20-30 minutes to work out, all these pauses only allow me to do a few exercises with most of my time spent standing still waiting for the program to resume. There is no way to make it resume until it does it on its own. It can take 10 or more minutes to go through one 16 rep exercise because of this. It is very frustrating because to my knowledge I AM doing it correctly. Since it is apparently sensing that one's position is wrong, why can't it tell you WHAT you're doing wrong so you can correct it?The exercise band that comes with the DVD is very wimpy. Fine for someone who never uses their arms at all I suppose, but it did nothing for me."
54784,2,I read all the reviews before I put this laser on my gamo pt85 blowback took my time and carefully installed this to my gun. I got it dialed in to shoot rite on point. Then took a 5-8 shots and it was off site again. Did it all over again 5 more times and gave up! It's just for air soft or toy guns.

456641,0,"I ordered this product last Friday because I wanted to sit on my patio on Saturday but after all this rain..the mosquitos and gnats were insane! I got it Saturday morning which was great! Ok, the worst part was I had to put it together. Well, my husband I did it and it took about 15-20 minutes. As one reviewer mentioned it is definitely too small for the 9inch umbrella! But, since I am adventurous and decided I would make it work, I cut the elastic that goes over the umbrell at each seam to open it up more and started with shorter cuts and made them larger going all the way around until the screen hit the ground. There was plenty of material still on the top of the umbrella so it wouldn't slide off. The hardest part were those poles that go around the bottom that never really matched up perfectly. But, the material is very sturdy, the mosquito's or gnats can't get in unless they sneak in when you open the zipper. I know I can't send it back because I cut it, but it works fine now!"

276917,0,"I bought this to use at the beach and at the gym. I am a small person and the band is so tight it felt like I had a girdle on my wrist. It did securely hold my ID, credit card and key so I guess that's worth something. Very uncomfortable. I would not buy another one or recommend this to another person."
365626,0,"I bought several pairs because they were cheap and I just needed some shorts for the gym. I bought grey, black, navy, and green. The colors are pretty much accurate to the pictures.The material is thin, but I prefer something light-weight for working out. The elastic band doesn't bother me at all.I will say they are SHORT and SMALL. I generally wear a small and I ordered large for these (though a medium probably would have worked too). And they are very short - as in ""be careful when you're stretching"" short. I tend to wear them around the house all the time though since they're super comfortable."
381834,2,"I remember the days when the Flexible Flyer was a thing of quality. Made in the USA out of solid oak and steel. A sled on which any kid could do a belly flopper and never worry about the sled withstanding all the abuse. Now the sled, still called the Flexible Flyer is made in China. No longer made with oak, but another kind of wood. (Not sure what kind.) It is a very unstable sled and I will rework it to make it more stable before I give it to my grandson."
115672,1,"Excellent item. Can be used as described or easily modified for lateral behind the lower back mounting on your belt for fast deployment. Great item but make sure you don't need to buy it as some of KA-BAR's knives already come with this item and don't readily tell you that. Worth the retail price, but even better @ Amazon's prices."
410947,0,"It's made of nylon with a stainless bolt through the center and stainless springs that hold the wedges in place. Right now no replacement parts are being offered. The cons; it bends if you're working on a particularly heavy bike or if it's not seated properly, the ends of two of the wedges snapped off and the spring mangled up, held together now with a rubber band and super glue, it lowers the bike by about 4-6 inches which can be a pain if you have a fixed stand, it can't be used on cut frames and sometimes it gets stuck in the tube and I find myself reaching for the hammer... Pros; it will fit very small tubes such as sidewalk bikes, once it is set it holds very well, saw, hammer, drill, build it's not dropping, the clamping surface is octagon so you don't have to worry about it twisting to the side while working. I still prefer the old stainless model but no longer available."

Assembly was a breeze.This was a gift for a Mets fan. Even though it is a youth product, we hang out clothes on it. It works fine. It's sturdy and has not tipped over even under the weight of several layers of adult clothing.The only complaint I have for the manufacturer is that the package arrived with 3 stickers on 3 different sides of the box that showed the product. This was ordered as a gift, so when it arrived, the recipient knew what was in the box immediately."
461848,1,The bookbag by Teton Sports is my favorite. I ordered a red one and I can't believe all the room it has in it.

The battery pack cannot be disconnected from the light meaning you have to lug around the battery pack all the time or take the whole light and battery pack off teh bike and put it back on all the time.

Pedro's tools are everywhere and when their version of a tool is the best I get it. Cone wrenches are pretty similar in quality for the most part. The only reason I give these 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel all cone wrenches are overpriced for what you get. I certainly would not use them for pedals though."

272662,0,"I've used many pairs (7+) of these gloves over the last 5 or 6 years for heavy bag workouts (~5 hours a week). Including look-alikes marketed under different names which are essentially identical.After about 8 months of use, the interior dye starts wearing off, so your knuckles turn black. Serious scrubbing after a workout to remove the color. A month or so after that, they start to stink and end up having to be thrown in favor of a new pair, although the gloves themselves show little sign of wear at that point. It's a regular, predictable pattern.Tried glove dogs, careful drying, ""BO"" sprays, etc. The spray is useless, the glove dogs can extend it a few months before the gloves become biohazards, but that's not the real problem -- buying new gloves every year isn't so bad.The problem is, every once in awhile, you get a pair which for some reason, are less effective protection. Switch to the new pair and knuckles start bruising big time immediately. Go back to the old pair, or get a different new pair, and the bruising stops. Same size, same feel, different protection results. There's something about a percentage of these gloves that isn't quite right and you end up with inadequate protection.So I've started looking for something else -- it's too hit and miss. If you get a good pair, they will still go sour pretty fast and you're back to square one.Possibly if you use them less often and get lucky with your first pair, these things won't be a factor.UPDATE: Ringside's ""Gel Shock Thunder Bag Gloves"" seem to address the disadvantages of this style of glove. Partly open palm (still w/grip bar) means they dry fast (a couple minutes) so may not stink up as fast. The impact protection seems better. No XL size, it seems. Only question is how they hold up over time. We'll see.FURTHER UPDATE: I've found rubbing baking soda into every part of the gloves solves the smell problem. Wouldn't you know the cheapest solution is the one that works best. So much for expensive sprays, glove dogs, etc.Another update: Also tried Primetime MMA-4 gloves mentioned by another reviewer. Nicely made gloves that hold their dye, but not ideal for heavy bag work. The padding is thick, bouncy and shaped such that bag strikes tend to be ""deflected"" and bounce/roll away. Makes for a very unsatisfying work out, stresses wrist, etc. These gloves seem better suited to grappling or flat hand work than a fist and head-on impact.I've been switching between Harbinger's, Ringside Thunder bag gloves, and Primetime MMA-4 and find I am glad when the Ringside's come up in the rotation since they feel the best and protect the best.It seems the Gel-Shock's are the clear winners, just be sure they dry completely between use, else the odor problem accelerates and you can even get dye-transfers. I have 4 pairs in rotation so use a given pair only about once a week."

221851,2,"Ordered a bud light and a bud throw line, instead received a bud light and a generic throw line. Not at all what was ordered and confirmed via email. Obviously, this seller does not pay attention to his product shipping. Very disappointed but not worth the hassle/expense of returning. You expect something as small as this (and not expensive) to be handled right. This is a problem with computer ordering an inexpensive product that if wrong is not worth the time of hassling with to make right."
336961,0,"I'm very ambivalent about this case. It's nicely made, feels very solid, and looks good. I like the external pocket for a water bottle. The case is good value for the money (at Amazon's price, anyway). But it doesn't really have enough space in it. Put in a laptop, a power supply, an optical mouse, a pair of headphones, and there is not enough room for much else. I tend to carry around books, a spiral-bound notebook, pens, and other such detritus besides the computer, and this bag doesn't spread out much. I'm looking for something to replace my Kore Gear bag, which is much roomier but is getting long in the tooth -- and more of the same don't seem to be readily available. I'll keep this one around for use when I need it, but it's not the ideal replacement."

The brand new generation of Ozeri 4X3 ""Razor"" now comes with an extra battery, a clip and a leash, and it is smaller and lighter (I should have waited a week to order them - sorry, friends!) Get the Ozeri!"
275242,0,"The first Bike Beam I received was broken. The plastic collar at the junction for the two parts of the bar was broken in the box. This piece has no structural function so I could let it slide. A more serious problem was one of the jaws would not lock in the closed position. There's a spring-loaded metal ball which fits in a hole in the jaw when closed. My ball would never engage the hole to lock the jaw. The Beam is useless if the jaws cant be locked.I called Saris and a replacement was sent out same day with a prepaid label to send back the broken Beam. Excellent customer service!The replacement Beam was undamaged and functions correctly.There's one glaring design flaw in my humble opinion. The diameter of the Beam's two telescoping tubes is 7/8"" for the smaller and one inch for the larger. This is considerably smaller than the minimum diameter of the clamps on my rack. I use the Beam with a Saris Bones rack which I think is fantastic. It holds a standard bike more securely than any other rack I've tried. When using the Bike Beam, the clamps on the rack cannot tightly cinch on the small diameter of the Beam. The Beam (and bike) bounce readily since the clamps don't even touch the top of the Beam. I use some thick foam to make up the gap and allow the clamps to apply a bit of downward pressure on the Beam. Had Saris simply made the Beam a diameter similar to a bike's top tube, this problem would not exist. It's surprising that Saris makes a bike rack accessory that their own rack cannot securely clamp."
167920,0,"Most of the 18 prior reviewers seems to think the table was pretty easy to put together, and maybe it is if your of average handyness. Fortunately, you have me to give another perspective, the kind of person who, when putting stuff together, frequently has to go back two steps because he screwed something on backwards. While this review is mainly for those in the same boat and not for handy folks, hopefully it has a little something for everyone. Ok, installation:(1) just diagrams, essentially no words. Diagrams are confusing at times. For example, there was a diagram with 4 steps listed on a single page, and I thought they were all connected -- but no, steps 3 and 4 were to be done on another similar part and not part of a sequence with 1 and 2, where the part for steps 3 and 4 was slightly different from the part in steps 1 and 2. With my wife helping, there was a minimal degree of messing up a step and going backwards, but we still had a good amount of headscratch/debate time;(2) screws are organized too frustrate you. For example, 3 sizes of screw, 40, 50 and 55 mm are in the same bag, unmarked, mixed together. While that would be bad enough, there are 2 separate bags with these 3 screw types mixed together. Maybe there is a reason for that (one bag for each table half?) but since there are no words on the directions who knows? The directions have a little measuring thing, so your supposed to sort the screws yourself. There are also two similar looking types of washers that need to be unsorted, and my wife was having trouble telling them apart.(4) there was one place where it tells you to use your hands to get a metal end cap to stay on. Maybe if you have Paul Bunyan hands, but otherwise a hammer is needed. If your like me, getting the confidence to do something not in the directions takes a while;(5) there was one step where 2 large pieces of metal are supposed to overlap perfectly so you can screw them in. After 10-15 minutes, I realized I had done everything 100% correct and was convinced there was a manufacturing defect. Although I was entirely convinced it wouldnt work, somehow hammering did fix the problem.(6) net is a little frustrating to set up -- I got the net firm and stable, but I had to play with it to get that, and I dont think I did it right. Still, its stable and works fine.On the plus side, my wife and I *were* able to put the table together, and if we can do it, you probably can too, no matter how weak your skills. Sure it took us 4 solid hours, and it would have been longer if we werent stopping each other from making mistakes, but its done, and it looks like we did it right.Table itself seems of good quality (with the possible exception of the net, though after playing with the net its been stable for months), just knocking it down 2 stars for installation.Tip for the weak: If your not real strong and have steps, just open the box in your garage and carry the table halves separately. Also allows for easier manuevering to get it around corners and such. Worked well for us, and we are on the weaker side of normal.Random observation: While the table folds up really easily with no strength required, it doesnt make a perfect backboard for practicing by yourself as there is a pretty big gap between the upright table and the bottom table, meaning you'll lose balls into the gap. An advanced beginner and up can still practice that way, but its not viable for beginning kids -- the gap will eat too many balls. Still, the easy fold-up is an obvious plus, and I have no idea if there are tables that fold-up without gaps."

I asked a friend to pick it up for me after work which is fine. however, when i got it in the house i saw that the box said reebok treadmill on it. they sent the wrong item. i called amazon immediately and was told that i would receive a call the next day about shipping the item back on a saturday and would have a replacement within 5 days. i never received a call and so i called again today only to be told that if i wanted it picked up on a saturday i would have to pay a hefty fee and my item would not be shipped out until monday (it's friday) and i would get it in 7 business days from the day it was shipped. it wasn't until i told them i pregnant and couldn't lift something that weighed more than me that they agreed to pay for the extra cost to have someone come to my house at a convenient time and take the item (so i didn't have to take a day off from work to sit home all day waiting). i'll actually write a review of the product if i ever get it."
410129,0,"I bought this Ironman treadmill from Amazon at a great price. I believe it to be a sturdy, decent product, but ours arrived with what we believe to be loose deck mounts, so it squeaks horrifically when you step near the front of the deck. You can barely hear a loud television over the racket. While I'm tempted to take the treadmill apart and fix it myself, I would rather utilize the warranty while it's active.Now for the bad news. It takes 20-30 minutes to get a human on the line when you call Keys Fitness customer service. My call has been dropped after a long wait a couple of times, too. When I finally did get a person, they were very friendly and told me they'd get a service person out to repair my treadmill. Four weeks later, after hearing nothing from the service people, I called Keys again. Again they were very friendly and told me that they'd resend my service request and they gave me the number of the repair people so I could call them if I didn't hear from them. A week later, after hearing nothing, I called the repair folks, only to find out that they haven't done Keys warranty work for two years. They just ignore the orders they receive from Keys. How can Keys not know this??? When I called Keys back (another 30 minutes on hold) a technician reacted like it was no big deal and this happens all the time. In my mind, this is just unacceptable. No matter how friendly the people are, if the customer doesn't actually get service, then it's not customer service.It seems like a decent treadmill, but if you have to deal with Keys, good luck."
326451,1,"First off let me say that the picture makes it look like one rope, alas this is not the case. The package contains 1 wire brush and 1 cleaning rope. After running 500rds through my M&P15-22 the SSI did a quick job of cleaning my dirty barrel. It is alot faster than the whole rod routine, and as far as i could tell did a through job.

135748,1,"I first want to say that I do not understand all the poor reviews that state Insanity is just too difficult, I didn't lose the 20,30,40 pounds, it's not for people with bad joints, causes injury (and now I'm ruined for life), etc. I don't want to minimize their complaints - especially if they got hurt - but it is called INSANITY for the love of God! Was that not clear at all in the infomercial? Were the repeated warnings of 'this is not for everyone' unclear? Were the disclaimers of 'results may vary' not clear? When doing the workout, do Shaun's constant reminders to 'rest and get back at it', listen to your body, etc. not register? And for those with joint problems - why on earth did you ever think an extreme program with jumping exercise would be for you? Bottom line - lack of common sense does not make this a bad product.I am a stay-at-home mom of two kids and I am anything but athletic. I am no couch potato - but I haven't seen the inside of a gym for about 8 years. I get my exercise keeping up with my kids and cleaning my house/yard - period! Unfortunately, after having my last child and turning 40, that wasn't cutting it anymore. I was/am about 30 lbs overweight starting this program and I have been at it for 22 days now. Let me restate - I am NOT athletic and I am NOT in shape! In the beginning, I could do only 3 reps of a few of the exercises! It was sad! The point is, I listened to my body and rested when I needed to but didn't quit. Anything involving the 'Plank' position was next to impossible due to my weak little arms and the fact that I have had C-sections with each child, so my abs and core were weak. So I modified those a bit, and over just this short amount of time I am proud to say that I am doing all the exercises correctly and am up to at least 15 reps of even the toughest exercises, I have lost 4 pounds and am nearly down one pant size. I really feel as if I am on way to losing the 30 lbs and maybe more. But I don't expect it all in the first 60 days because my starting point was so weak.Bottom line - this is an excellent fitness program for just about anyone who doesn't have health problems, uses good old common sense, takes it at their own pace (don't 'dig deeper' until you feel you can), and doesn't expect to grace any fitness mag covers after 60 days. Shaun T is wonderful, very motivational and easy to follow. I am really looking forward to seeing my results after the next 38 days. And I thoroughly expect to continue to use Insanity in the intervals suggested."

409442,0,"I bought this vest from Amazon for less than 30$. At that price, it isn't a steal, but it's also not like you're wasting your money. The Cathedral Peak vest feels highly synthetic, but is well seamed and finished. The fit, like other reviewers have pointed out, is tight (I'm skinny, but it's barely loose around my body, and I'm talking about size M). For me, that's a plus, as I don't like the ""garbage bag poncho"" look, but you might like it that way. In terms of insulation, the plastic fabric shows its worth (could make you sweat a lot in a humid environment). Seems like a good choice for a desert/mountain environment, which is where I live.I've docked two full stars because of a simple fact: the pockets. They're horrible. The zippers open UPWARDS, when most technical clothing goes the other way around (and they chafe quite a bit). Worse, the pocket liner is a solid polyester fabric, instead of light mesh or microsuede like in better products, even from Columbia. I don't know about you, but I care about vest pockets very much, and these were a total disappointment. These people should know better.In short: it's a warm, fitted, cheap, plastic vest with terrible pockets. Still, it serves its role."

87635,1,"This gun is amazingly fun for just about anything. With the right pellets and CO2 it can be used for light target shooting, but I really love it for plinking in the backyard with a few pals. The single or double action option makes this gun great for a variety of different shooters with different tastes. I don't think anyone who has handled this gun has disliked it.Here's a quick overview:PROS:With the right equipment it can be very accurate.Heavy, comes with good grips even though they are plastic. Comfortable.Gun is mostly metal except exterior of the barrel and a few other parts.Aesthetically pleasing! The gun is beautiful.Stores CO2 well - next to no CO2 leaked out over a weeklong period, great seal.The clips are easy to remove and reload, which make the entire experience more enjoyable.NEVER jams... ever. Considering it's a revolver power by CO2 this is amazing.CONS:Not wholly metal. (Not a big deal to me)Already showing a bit of body rust despite having never been out in the rain or significant moisture! Still not too big of a deal but very strange.Sighting screw was amazingly cheap. A few turns and the screw was stripped completely... as though it were made of the softest metal on earth. Nearly made me return it as soon as it was received.The only con that concerns me is the screw, which I'd like to address because I was quite upset when this happened. Now, I may be a strong man but I am not a child and I certainly know when I am putting too much effort into turning a screw, and I was treating this gun like it was royalty when it first arrived. I did NOT turn this screw with great force. The screwdriver somehow ate into the metal as I was turning it, and it stripped the screw! I have NEVER seen this happen before and I was extremely shocked. This screwdriver can't be at fault either because it's been used on every door and fan in the house, as well as most of the screws in my vehicle. It was like the sighting screw was made out of lead... or butter. Funnily enough, the windage screw worked just fine... with the same screwdriver, might I add, and the same pressure I had applied to the other screw. It may have been a manufacturing defect, and because of this I looked to Crosman's website. I decided in the end the gun wasn't really worth a warrant return, and since I got it almost perfectly sighted in before the screw was wrecked I decided to keep the gun anyways. When considering the price, the sighting screw being the only problem is probably a good sign, but still a bit disappointing.Despite these difficulties, the gun is amazingly fun, and the fact I decided to keep it despite the trouble I had with it really is a testament to this fact. I sincerely hope these issues were limited to the one I purchased, but I feel I should post this review as a warning. If it happened to me, there is a possibility it could happen to you.OVERALL: I recommend this gun, but with a little caution. It is very fun, even when it comes with difficulty. If yours has no problems it may be one of the most enjoyable pellet guns you have ever owned. The pros outweigh the cons, just make sure you inspect it before you give it away as a gift or begin using it. :) happy plinking."

I haven't slept on it overnight yet, but I did lay on it for a while after blowing it up and here are my Pro's and Cons:PRO:Very comfortable - much more so than my old aero bedSits up higher off the ground than my aerobed didThe plug has a nice hide-away spot that my aerobed did not have for after you blow it up.Cons:Takes longer to inflate (Aerobed was done in under a minute - this one takes about 2 minutes)Takes MUCH longer to deflate - Aerobed could be deflated and put away in it's oversized bag in less than a minute... this one took over 5 minutes and was a struggle to fit back into the much smaller bag it came with.Overall... if you have the patience to mess with the added deflate time, It's a bargain.

260770,0,"I am a regular player in a county wide boffing group. Normally I fight as a ninja, and in fact to most that is all I am. Who cares that I am a green belt in Tai Chi? Surely it doesn't matter that I have studied axe theory online? What difference does it make that I have spent over 50 hours practicing stick work with my little brother? No I'm but a ninja. This was all going to change.Thus I purchased this practice sword with great expectations. I also purchased a Kimono and faux Fu Manchu mustache. The Kimono was a women's medium so it was a little loose on my battle tightened body, but with some well placed duct tape it wasn't too much of problem. That is until the ""event"" happened.I was alone surrounded by a veritable army. Dwarves, elves, monks, you name it. There must have been five or six warriors aged between 8 and 10 ready to finish the job. Little did they know I don't go down without a fight. I wanted to rout them in fear through a demonstration of samurai mastery. I started kicking and swinging my sword in all directions to let them know what they were dealing with. Then the duct tape holding my kimono up came loose and I tripped over the excess fabric. As I was struggling to get to my feet the horde attacked. They were all over me. I was pummeled for a few minutes, but eventually they got bored and left to drink some Wizard potions (Capri suns).But you never leave a beaten samurai alive, as honor demands that a samurai must fight to the very end. So I hiked up my kimono, ran over to the snacks table and unleashed a fury like none had seen before. Within a minute the horde was defeated, and not one was left uninjured. All were bruised and bleeding. A true victory by all accounts. But then those stupid kids ran and told their parents. And now I'm kicked out of the game!!!!! Thanks for nothing."
225,0,We have a double size of these but needed a twin. I ordered this and it came pretty quick. Box was in good condition and intact. Unfortuantely the night befor our company was to arrive I went to inflate it and noticed it leakin. Just below the pump there was a 1/2 inch slic and another near slice below that. It looked like the pump or something damaged. I had no optio but to use the repair kit and keep it as I had no time to wait for a replacement or to pay the shipping again. Not sure how to avaid this. thevinyl does not seem plyable enough tha it fractured the material or something.

225449,1,"All the reviews of this seat seem pretty accurate. I would add a couple things though.There is a ""sharp edge"" at the front of the seat where it tapers from wide to narrow. I put sharp in quotes because the seat is of course foam and so it's not going to cut you or rip your pants, but the edge is noticeable (at first). Other seats I have used have a more gentle rounding edge in that region and this makes sense for the repetitive cycling motion. After using this seat for a couple days I don't know if I got used to it, or if the foam shifted around a bit, but I don't notice the edge so much anymore. My advice: everyone has a different shape and riding posture, thus saddle preferences are very personal. This is a great saddle and it seems to fit many people. Try it, if you don't like be comforted to know Amazon has a good return policy.This seat is not the lightest one out there. Unfortunately I don't have a scale so can't tell you exactly how many grams, but subjectively it is heavier than the factory seat that came off my Specialized Allez Sport Triple. Factory seats are generally no known for their light weight so this is kinda heavy for a road bike seat. Having said that, I will GLADLY deal with an extra 100grams if it means I can actually ride the bike more than 15 minutes! You see, I have no padding down there, and those racing seats are just plain painful. I need something to distribute my ectomorph framed 170lbs. Also, I don't use riding shorts so any padding must come from the seat itself.Overall, great seat with one minor (seemingly temporary) anatomical boo-boo.B safe and keep the rubber side down..."
111713,2,Do not be fooled. This belt is rubbish and was useless after one training session. Would barely serve as a decoration.
77697,2,"I bought these thinking I was getting a higher quality product, the price was the only thing higher.After less than 6 weeks of use, they are ripping in multiple places and one is ripped all the way up the side. I also bought them from my 8 year old son and the same thing is happening to his as well, just at a slightly slower rate. I guess they are not meant for solid contact, maybe just point sparring or lightly tapping a bag/target.Next time I will just buy the cheapest pair expecting to throw them in the trash and I wouldn't be so disappointed.UPDATE:The company did replace the product free of charge so I updated my review since they did stand behind their product. Unfortunately The new pair is starting to rip again same as the old pair. I think these are decent if you are not kicking hard ie. light sparring. I would not use they for kick any bags or targets with force (this is why I got them). Light kicks to people with these will protect your opponent, but using these for power kicks to a bag results in them falling apart, also they do not stay in place well after a few hard kicks and I have to adjust them."

207468,0,"First time out, filter smashed to bits. This was I guess my fault, was trying to remove the filter for cleaning... good luck. finally got it 'unlocked' but the filter wouldn't come out, so I pumped a few times thinking maybe that would help, the filter fell out onto a rock and smash... all over. At least it was my last day, and was actually headed back to the trailhead when this happened. So, yeah water that I pulled from a gross puddle tasted great, but I made up a few curse words while trying to clean the filter the whole trip, and you know the rest. I don't think my wife, or anyone on the dainty side would be able to unlock the filter to clean it, and that pretty much sucks considering it's fairly important when using this. You can't even 'unlock' it with the provided minimal grip surface, had to grab the tabs underneath... I dunno folks, I don't think I'll even replace the broken filter considering how much of a pain it was to use... pretty heavy also."

373794,0,"I saw this watch in a national chain on sale, but we saved $1,100 by buying on Amazon - 1) bigger discount 2) no sales tax. First of all a warning about buying from Amazon. If you buy this watch at and Authorized Dealer, the co-axial escapment watches have a 3 year warranty. All other Omegas have a 2 year warranty. Since Amazon is not an authorized dealer, they replace the Omega warranty with their own warranty. However, they only provided a 2 year warranty. So I guess I lost a year of warranty for the $1,100 of savings. Plus - I had to take the watch to shop to have it fitted properly.On a full wind, it usually stops keeping time after 30 or so hours. (closer to 30) That is pretty dissappointing. Because it is so big, you can't wear it all the time. I have had the watch for a month, and I have had to readjust the time about 10 times.Also, when I do manage to wind it, it still loses about 4-5 seconds a day. That is over 30 seconds a week, that is 2 minutes a month - I was just very surprised that something so expensive needed so much adjusting. Over the course of year - that is 30 minutes - let's hope I don't get stranded on a desert island!The Chronograph doesn't allow split times. Once you stop it, then restart it, it doesn't catch up - it just starts where you stopped it. Considering the Chronograph increases the price nearly $1,500 over the exact watch without it - that isn't very good.Also, it doesn't really explain how you are supposed to keep track of long times. There is the second hand, then a dial that keeps track of 30 minute intervals, then a dial that keeps track of 12 hour intervals. So say you time somthing that is 1:01 minutes and 15 seconds. It is can look like 1:01 or 1:31. It kind of looks like the hour hand moves half a tick - but you would never get that from the instruction manual. So let's just hope I never have to time something over 30 minutes.Finally, the Operating instructions are horrible. You get 450 page manual. But only 1/10th of that is in English, and the book covers every Omega made, so reading about this particular model requires deciphering a complex coding system. It could have used a 2 page insert on just this watch. Also, the only thing you get that ""tells"" you about the watch is a little plastic thing with a gold string - again with a complex coding system - given the money - they could have provided a list of all its features.Having said that, it is pretty. The weight takes some getting use to. I still have to take it off when I type. I wouldn't actually dive with it though."
268891,0,"Ordered through Amazon and delivery was quite prompt. Everything intact and no damage from shipping. However, upon inspection it was clear that the workers at the factory put the bike together (""mostly assembled"") poorly. The gears and brakes were installed in reverse from their proper position on the handlebar. The forks were installed backward, leaving the cables very twisted. Of course that can be easily remedied by a customer who is handy with a wrench.Clearly this is an entry-level mountain bike, which is what you should expect at this price. Some of the components are great; the Kendra tires, the alloy seatpost, the Grip shifters and the front disk brakes. Other components, however, are low-end. I upgraded the stock crankset (also used by the dreadful Mongoose brand) with an affordable Shimano model. The presence of thin and tinny steel chainrings was particularly dissapointing. But some of this shouldn't matter to folks who just want a solid commuter bike or hybrid bike for touring. As another reviewer said, the KDX2 isn't made for bounding from boulder to boulder or trying to leap into steep drops or over wide chasms. But I anticipate it will be fine (probably even very good) for causual riders (pavement, roads, moderate/flat paths.The aluminum frame is great but a bit high for folks less than 5-foot 9 inches tall. The Kawasaki manual is a bit minimal but clearly illustrated. This bike is a good deal when it is priced significantly below $200. If the cost begins to climb above $200 as an alternative I would recommend seeking out a true MTB at entry-level from one of the superior brands; such as Diamondback or Giant, both of which can be had for $300.By the way, don't misplace the importance of the Kawasaki name. The name was part of the attraction for me but I discovered that these bicyles have no association with the giant Japanese industrial company. The name is licensed by an independent company, The Cycle Source Group LLC. I gather that at least one of their products, the ""Honda"" MTB is a dud, but they've made a decent bike in the aluminum-frame, full suspension KDX2. Solid welds and great appearance."

501210,1,"Now that most of my swimming is in gym/hotel pools, I prefer this type of trunk because it packs easily, dries fast, and offers more room in the crotch than lycra/spandex suits. Best of all, because it has no lycra, it should maintain its shape and not get baggy with age. I still use my all nylon Speedos from decades ago, but until now I could not find a replacement.Speedo offers an all nylon trainer suit too at a higher price, but based on pictures and reviews of that suit, it appeared to be boxier. The Tyr really does have a 4"" side rise, which I prefer.Keep in mind that this type of suit rides on the hips and is sized by hip rather than waist measurement. Like many tall people, I have a slim waist and wide hips -- for me a 34"" waist is loose in slacks, but way too small in swim trunks. I ordered a size 36 and like it, but could even wear a 38 comfortably.Yes, the waist and leg openings are tight, but I assume they will relax a bit with time, and they are comfortable now.The construction appears to be very good. The nylon appears to be a bit heavier weight than in my old Speedos and the front panel is more generous. And the Tyrs cost about 30% less, so I bought 2 pair.I would give these trunks 5 stars, but I do not yet know how well they will hold up -- I assume well, and I'll be back to add the 5th star in a few years."

5593,0,"I feel like a blasphemer writing this review, because Plano stands atop the market for quality, affordable gun cases. This particular case is disappointing, however, because it cannot be adequately secured. Once upon a time I was checking firearms at the airport, something I do 20-30 times a year. I was traveling with several that day, one of which I decided to secure in the factory hard case it came in. That case, like this Plano, had a single, centrally located spot for the lock. I had the pleasure of being attended to by an unusually ... let's say &#34;driven&#34; ... agent who politely but firmly explained to me that if she could find a way to worm her very small hands into my case despite its lock, Messrs. Heckler & Koch would not pass. Fortunately that case was so stiff and compact, despite the agent prying and probing the sides as best she could, that extraction of any contents proved impossible.This experience has always stuck with me, and came immediately to mind upon receiving this case. The first thing I did was pop a weapon into it and secure it with a padlock. Then, leaving the clasps undone, I pried open the left side, just as my zealous agent would have done. I very easily extracted a full sized pistol, right past the lock. The materials are good, the construction is sound, and the design is user friendly. One lock point, however, is not enough for a case this size. Let's forget about hard-charging lady agents for a moment. What about the prying hands of an exploring child? No bueno. This case is good for basic storage, but not security."
81459,0,"I am terrible at getting new batteries for my watch, so I thought an Eco-drive would be cool. I found this watch while on vacation the first year Eco-drives were available, and no other watch looked as classy or attractive. It is a bit heavy, and the dial gets scratched up pretty easily. However, if you take care of this watch it lasts years.My biggest qualm was the repair/customer service. My brother accidentally knocked my watch of a table onto a tile floor, and obviously the face cracked. The watch was working fine, but I wanted to get the face fixed. I paid the $80 repair fee and waited a month to get it back. When I got it back: the face was replaced with a non-scratch resistant glass, the time adjustment wouldn't turn the dial, and all other calendar updating functions were broken. The watch finally died 6 months later. Overall, if you treat it right it has the potential to last many years, lifetime.... questionable.If it weren't for the awful customer service I would probably have bought a new one years ago. However, it really is a stunning watch so I may be buying one again soon if I have a more disposable income :P."

325257,1,"Having had a lower rated fire safe, I wanted to upgrade to one that would protect paper documents and electronic media. This safe's rating is certainly what I wanted and is solidly built. However, the actual space to store things is very small, so pay attention to the total volume it holds. I sort of knew the size it advertises, but it did not really hit home until I received it. It is still plenty big to hold my papers and some USB drives, but do not expect to be able to store much more than that in it.It is very, very heavy also. This and the small storage space is the price one has to pay to get such a high fire rating and flood protection. So it is not really the manufacturer's fault that the space is small, but that is what it takes to protect the contents to such high temperatures. I use it for the most important documents and files, and keep the larger, less important but more durable items in my older safe.Also, there is no ""bolt down"" option, so this safe is more about fire and flood protection than it is about theft prevention. I assume that any through holes for bolting it down would make it hard to retain the level of fire/flood protection."
225528,0,"I have had this bike seat for a little over a month now and it isn't too bad.When I first received the product, I was pleased with the appearance. It was shorter, length wise, than the stock seat for my road bike but did the advertised job. There was no longer any pressure on my perineum. UNFORTUNATELY, like other reviewers have stated, it places a tremendous amount of pressure on your sit bones. This can be easily rectified by pushing your butt back but it does change the way you ride. Anything over 10 miles of riding tends to irritate my bottom a bit. Short distance riding is fine but I would invest in cycling shorts for anything over 15 miles.This seat also puts a bit more pressure on your wrists and hands so beware."

I may have missed it in the description, but I don't remember seeing it, but it appears to be a gravity pump. this pump is probably good for filling boats in the water since they will be below the pump during filling. I've had to move the generator close to deck stairs, carry the heavy (full) pump up 3 stairs and then be able to pump fuel into the generator. Also the pump handle mechanism is a let down, it doesn't cut off when you release the handle, it takes about 5 seconds so you are either over-filling or spilling fuel.Not as expected, but I guess good for storing fuel in a shortage."
161088,2,"I ordered this watch as an everyday watch. I only got it wet while washing dishes or a couple of times in the shower. Within 3 weeks, there was moisture under the crystal that fogged it over. This is definitely not a ""Diver's watch"". It never went under water more than 6"" and was supposed to be rated down to 200 meters. It is a piece of junk. I returned it to Amazon for a refund."
50241,0,"These are listed in the ""running"" section, so I thought an interior key pocket would be a given. What a hassle to have to return these, especially given the seller's return policy, which I would encourage you to thoroughly check out before purchasing (by the time I return these I expect to have almost paid the price of the shorts - just for shipping - and they don't even weigh a whole pound). Hopefully this review helps someone else to whom a key pocket is important. I give them 2 stars for being cute, though."
365012,0,"This is quite possibly the best knife in it's class.Very competitively priced, functional and aesthetically pleasing. (The knife I received yesterday actually had the black blade, which I think looks better than the silver one pictured here)The knife is very well balanced; very light and the clip fits snugly enough against the knife that when you clip the knife to your pocket, for example, you can be sure it is not going to fall out.The knife has an ingenious way of opening by means of flicking the rounded nub (visible underneath the knife when it is open) swiftly. This technique allows one to fully open and lock the blade in a matter of milliseconds; and I believe this is a vastly superior opening mechanism to any other knife in its class. (I also own the assisted opening Gerbers and this method is much quicker.)This method is also great because I am left handed and thus the knife is well suited to ambidextrous operation.In addition, when open, this nub provides a ridge which would potentially prevent your fingers from slipping from the handle onto the cutting edge of the blade. Very clever.Once opened the blade locks firmly into place and is not loose at all. The serrations are effective and the blade is reasonably sharp.All in all and excellent knife and worthy of your money.EDIT: I am not sure if this has always been an issue with the knife, however the lock doesnt firmly lock the knife into place. It clicks into place, however even with moderate pressure it is easy to close the blade without disengaging the safety lock. Disappointing"
187798,0,"I read other reviews of the Schwinn Meridian Adult Tricycle and the only complaints were of the bike arriving without all the parts. That's what happened to me! The two rear wheels have different shaped hub-holes as the two axles are shaped differently. I received two same-shaped wheels, which means I did not receive the correct wheel on one side. I called customer service for the manufacturer, and it took about 10 days to get a wheel shipped to me. They sent the same wrong wheel again (!), even though I had emailed numerous pictures and explained the problem. It took about a week to get the correct wheel sent to me. So, from start to finish, it took about a month for me to order my bike and then put the whole thing together. I am not sure if it was worth the cost savings buying it this way. The bike works fine, now, it just was a lot of trouble and frustration getting it. After putting it together, I went to a bike shop and had them adjust the brakes, chain, and other things--which I highly recommend. Cost me about $55 at the bike shop to get everything correctly adjusted."

291867,0,"It is nice to drink from a container that does not pose a health threat (that we know of). It's easy to fill not only with a beverage, but ice goes in easily. The bottle fits in cup holders in vehicles without a problem.Here's the one drawback: IT SWEATS badly. Without any kind of insulation, the canteen naturally sweats, especially during warm, humid days. I put a couple of old foam can coolers on it (remove the bottom of one and slip it toward the top) and that really helped. Problem here; it doesn't fit in the cup holder of the car. I believe they make an insulated cover but I have not yet looked closely at them.In addition, with a ""recycled"" plastic soda bottle, you don't have to worry about losing it and costing you a small fortune."

300740,0,"My wife researched elliptical machines for several months. We looked at a wide range of machines, from entry level to gym quality. We ultimately decided on the Schwinn 430 due to the small footprint, the stride, and the solid feeling of the machine given its price point. My biggest reservation came while reading comments from numerous reviewers about squeaking issues.After carefully assembling the machine, I got on for a test ride. Smooth and quiet! Excellent, I thought. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. The next morning my wife got on for her first workout. Exactly two minutes into her routine, a soft clunking sound started coming from the left handlebar central pivot. Two minutes later, a squeaking noise started. By the end of her 30 minute workout, there was squeaking coming from both handlebar pivot points that was so loud I had to crank the TV up to hear the dialogue! I guess I wasn't so lucky.In my opinion, the Achilles' heel of this machine is the design of the central handlebar pivot point mechanism. Each pivot consists of a plastic ""bushing"" and a metal axle. The axle and bushings come from the factory with a very light coat of grease. In the case of my machine, clearly not enough lubrication was applied to prevent squeaking. In addition, because the bushings are lightly coated with grease, they attracted black plastic ""sawdust"" and other small fragments during manufacture and shipping. This debris may have also contributed to my squeaking issues. The fix was fairly easy. I disassembled the offending squeaking points, cleaned all of the grease and plastic debris off of the bushings and axles and then re-applied a coat of synthetic white lithium grease to all contact points. I used synthetic grease as I've read that petroleum based grease may break down plastic parts over time.... I reassembled everything and during a subsequent 30 minute workout session the machine was squeak free. In my opinion, Schwinn could solve this whole issue by simply supplying a tube of high-quality grease and leaving the pivot points clean. I guess they assume that the pre-applied lubricant will get most machines through the 90 day labor warranty period without squeaks.... Perhaps I'm too cynical.So what's the long term life expectancy of the machine and maintenance requirements? Not sure. I imagine that I'll have to perform the above steps for the other pivot points and will likely need to repeat the process for all pivot points on some periodic basis. If the pivot points stay lubricated, I'm hoping the plastic bushings hold up for 5 years or more. At which point, I'll feel like I've gotten good value out of the machine. Perhaps, worn bushings will be replaceable as necessary.... That could extend the life of the machine indefinitely.I give the machine three stars because it is a good value for the price point. Be aware that you may get squeaking issues right out of the box or experience the issue at some point down the road. Additional lubrication appears to solve the problem (at least based on my short term experience). I'll update this review at some point in the future if/when the handlebar pivot points start squeaking again. That's my first hand info for anyone considering this purchase. Cheers!"

The valve caps are about 1.0 inches tall, .75 inches wide, and sit about .5 inches above valve cap when screwed on.~These valve caps appear to be decent quality to me thus far.~Color contrast - if you actually want these valve caps to be visible/noticed then don't get the same valve cap color as your bike rims. In my case my bike rims are silver and these valve caps are silver so they aren't really noticeable. I wish I got gold color instead.Overall, I give 3 stars because they are decent (average) but not amazing. I hope you found my review helpful."

478465,0,"We only were able to use this tent once last year - towards the end of summer. It held up well enough except, of course, the stakes are extremely cheap and it didn't stay in the ground well. I'm not surprised with this price range. But that is easily remedied by a set of metal stakes (which we didn't have at the time). It didn't stand up very well in the wind - we ended up having to take off the wings and tie it down to nearby trees. But even with those problems, everything else seemed fine enough - the tent is big enough for a queen sized air mattress and it kept us dry and cool.I was excited to try the tent out again this year with metal stakes until we tried to put it up for our Memorial weekend trip. We were very careful with packing the poles last year but TWO of them were broken when we took them out of the bag yesterday (the cord in the middle). I tried to put one of them back together but it didn't work. I'm just glad we tried it a week before going. I can only assume they were too stressed last year with the wind that they didn't hold up when we collapsed them and put them in the bag.So to sum up - get metal stakes and BE VERY CAREFUL with the poles."

At around 90 to 100 psi they feel like you are running on a flat. Between 80 and 90 psi they feel really comfortable but that increases the rolling resistance. They can run all the way down to 60 if you really must and I have even limped home 20 miles on 40 psi thanks to a useless mini pump after a flat.The first 1000 miles was OK. (not brilliant but OK and still a huge improvement over a set of Conti Ultra Gatorskins)Negatives:However after 1000 miles they started to cut up badly, the rubber is just too soft and every ride (and I do mean every ride however short) there was another cut, more punctures and another load of glass and grit embedded which needed removing. After going through 4 tubes in 3 weeks I replaced them with Vittoria Diamante Pros - more expensive but SO much better.Not the easiest to get on and off the rims but I have had much worse (eg Conti Ultra Gatorskins)"

63250,1,"HELSTAR's 1986 album ""Remnants Of War"" is American power-thrash metal at its finest! This was music for metal fans who love aggressive, sophisticated riffs that groove as well as attack, virtuoso-level guitar leads that never get TOO hyper-technical, rock solid rhythm sections where the bassist lays the perfect foundation for attack and is telepathically linked to a drummer who plays in the pocket, gets down and dirty with pummelling double-bass(at always the appropriate moments), and lastly, a singer whose lungs seem as deep as hell itself, allowing him to effortlessly run the gamut with a low/mid to stratosphere high range and a delivery packed with charisma and sheer metal mastery. BUT, most importantly, it was the quality of the individual songs(and how they fit together so perfectly in an album context) that truly brought HELSTAR's second album ""Remnants Of War"" perilously close to the edge of heavy metal perfection and godlike status.But of course, it was not to be. For in 1986 a band from California called SLAYER released a big-budget(for thrash/speed metal of such an extreme nature) masterpiece of flawless production and sheer sonic violence called ""Reign In Blood"". This album would forever change the landscape of extreme metal and cause thrash bands worldwide to focus in many cases not on quality and construction of aggressive, traditonal post-NWOBHM songs and top-notch musicianship, but instead on the sheer speed of their songs(there are exceptions of course who managed both, such as Germany's PROTECTOR). So while HELSTAR's '86 offering had every bit the aggression, musicianship, and quality tunes as ""Reign In Blood"" they did not play at 120 beats per minute(although factoring in double bass, HELSTAR probably had some insanely high bpm's), nor did they enjoy major label support(although Combat Records who released ""Remnants"" was a mid-major with decent ditribution) and promotion.Now a little background. HELSTAR were formed in Texas in '82/'83 by a group of extremely young metal heads(lead by vocalist James Rivera and guitarist Larry Barrigan) who quickly recorded a stellar demo and by 1984 released their debut ""Burning Star"" LP(which was met with huge critical acclaim and quickly put HELSTAR and the Texas metal scene on the map as a hot-spot to closely watch). While not as technical or aggressive as ""Remnants Of War"", ""Burning Star"" certainly foreshadowed what was to come, while at the same time gaining its own status as a legendary piece of early U.S. power-thrash heavy metal(almost like a New Wave Of American Heavy Metal as influenced by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, and the burgeoning American hardcore punk scene of the early 80s). By ""Remnants Of War"" Rivera and Barrigan had recruited the hugely talented bassist Jerry Abarca, a young guitar hot-shot who could strip paint off walls named Rob Trevino, and drum madman Rene Luna. This now almost totally Hispanic line-up of killer metal musicians spent '85 writing ""Remnants Of War"" and upon its release in '86 were once again heaped with critical acclaim worldwide. As ""Metal Forces"" #15 stated: ""These guys are on the cutting edge of something very big. Helstar's brand new offering proves they are not running with the rest of the pack"".The album, from the first second of the brief intro to the final notes of the classic ""Angel Of Death""(NO, SLAYER weren't the only band that released a balls out, killer track titled ""Angel Of Death"" in 1986), is flawless. Tunes like ""Conquest"" with its supremely epic riffage, ""Suicidal Nightmare"" with James Rivera's blistering yet melodic vocals, ""Evil Reign"" and its savage rhythms, and the leads...Oh the guitar leads. Everywhere on the album Barrigan and Trevino just tear it up in the most perfect fashion. Never trying to be too over the top or too neo-classical, but just right in blending their technical, modern stylings with hints of the gods like Tipton & Downing from JUDAS PRIEST or Michael Denner and Hank Sherman from MERCYFUL FATE for example. Also, throughout the album James Rivera further bolsters his legit reputation as one of metal's greatest voices. But for me the most astounding thing about ""Remnants Of War"" is the sheer catchiness of these quite technically sophisticated power-thrash tunes. Every song has a chorus that is powerful enough to get stuck in your head after only a listen or two! Also, the production is top-notch with a still young Randy Burns(who had and would go on to produce & engineer, some of the most legendary extreme metal/hardcore/crossover LPs of all-time, POSSESSED-""Seven Church's"" LP, SUICIDAL TENDENCIES classic '83 debut, KREATOR-""Extreme Aggression"" & ""Coma Of Souls"" LPs, MEGADETH-""Peace Sells..."" LP, just a handful of examples)laying down a perfect knob-job and giving HELSTAR in my opinion their greatest sounding album, and in doing so giving the metal world one of the greatest sounding power-thrash albums ever. Quite simply, ""Remnants Of War"" is nine tracks of pure malicious metal madness. The track listing is:1. Unidos Por Tristeza (Intro) 2. Remnants Of War 3. Conquest 4. Evil Reign 5. Destroyer 6. Suicidal Nightmare 7. Dark Queen 8. Face The Wicked One 9. Angel Of DeathSo if you have never heard HELSTAR period, but love classic aggressive headbangin' 80s heavy metal(like early METAL CHURCH, early FATES WARNING, early AGENT STEEL, ABBATOIR, LEIGE LORD, BLESSED DEATH, ATTACKER, THRUST, TROUBLE, EXCITER, RAZOR, classic MEGADEATH and ANTHRAX, NASTY SAVAGE, HALLOW'S EVE, or the early LPs of German power-thrashers like RAGE or the first couple albums by Switzerland's CORONER, and tons of other classic groups circa '86) of the highest grade, PLEASE do yourself a favor and check out ""Remnants Of War""(as well as HELSTAR's ""Burning Star"" LP '84, ""A Distant Thunder"" LP '88, and the ballsy, super-technical concept-driven ""Nosferatu"" LP '89). If you're a HELSTAR fan but simply haven't heard ""Remnants"", YOU NEED IT NOW!Now don't hesitate, order the CD! The version on Century Media released in 1999 is a superb release with a top-notch remaster of the album-it truly sounds AWESOME-and a nice booklet and high-quality reproduction of the artwork. When you finally get the album, be it on CD, an old cassette, or the rad original foil-cover LP, take a few puffs, crank it up and be prepared for a sore neck the following day! I guarantee that in an alternate dimension or universe somewhere, when metalheads are asked to name THE album of 1986, they state without hesitation: ""REMNANTS OF WAR""!!!!!"
123181,0,"This is a nice trap for the price. You get what you pay for. The spring arm has good action, but the bolts don't hold well under regular use. The settings are easy to adjust if you don't mind playing with it at first. Once we had it set it was easy to keep the clays on target for the kids. Again, the bolts do not stay tight under regular use, just be ready to tighten them every five or so throws, but be careful not to over tighten them and stip out the nuts."
96841,0,"I purchased this model directly from Proform because it was a little cheaper than any other source. I had a very limited budget for exercise equipment, so despite the negative reviews I still bought the Proform 900 with Reflex Step. I did, howerver, decide to go for the 2 year warranty just in case. The package arrived in good order. My husband was able to put it together without any extra help while watching a football game, so it seemed to be easy to assemble. Everything major on it works just fine so far.Having said all of that, I do have some minor issues with it. First, the digital console is difficult for me to read. Second, the readings on the heart rate monitor do seem to change drastically from one moment to the next, which makes me question its accuracy. Third, it wobbles. Finally, I have to make sure the adjustable console is screwed in tight before every use or it will suddenly drop down in the middle of the work out.Those are all minor things that I can adjust to, and I think I got what I paid for. All in all, the machine gives me a great workout. I think next time I'll just save my money for a higher quality machine."

248987,0,"4 plates, bowls, cups, and 4 each of silverware. Items were packaged well. Didn't like the 'Made in China' sticker on all 12 dishes that I had to remove. These items feel like they are metal, and have a fired ceramic shell. Some of my cups had cracks in the ceramic, but it doesn't effect the use of the cup. They are pretty light materials. The silverware seems sturdy enough... at least for camping. Seems like they would be fairly easy to clean as well. I gave it 3 starts instead of 5 because I think the price is a little high. I guess I'll see how long they stand up to our camping use, before I know if they were worth the near $40."
378226,1,"I used the site's drop down list to be sure it would fit my car and it does, nicely. I haven't yet tried carrying more than one bike, and while it appears to be well made and up to the task---it just looks like a tight fit for three bikes. Once fitted to the car, it's an easy on, easy off operation. I like it."
484234,0,"These are nicely styled compared to what is available as hiking shorts in any local stores. My only complaint is the use of velcro to hold the pockets closed. It is necessary to 'peel' your pockets open thus, it takes two hands to put your wallet back in the pocket. Try doing that while sitting in your car. Otherwise, nice shorts."
162729,0,"The unit is easy to operate and looks good. However, the band is too small. I am an adult male and the last hole on the band works, but is not comfortable."
507335,0,"For about $20, it's a fun toy. However, it's not very accurate. At about 10-15 feet, the bbs are high by about 3-4 inches and left 1-2 inches. They group fairly consistent in about a 1-1.5"" spread. I tried both the bbs it came with and some crossman .20 bbs.At a distance of about 20 feet, the bbs are high by about 6-8"" and left by 4"". The group spreads to about 4"".The gun cannot pierce an aluminum can or cardboard at point blank.The inaccuracy is likely due to the manufacturer's attempt to increase distance with the fixed hop-up system. However, the inaccuracy makes for frustrating target practice."
464663,2,The foam slips off the handle all the time. Terrible product needed lots of tape and glue on the inside to stay put.
18690,0,"I ordered two women's shirts from G-III. Both items were too small. I wear a women's small, and most of the time they are big on me. I ordered the hoodie in a medium so it would be big enough to wear over another shirt. However, it was so small I could barely even get it on. I believe the sizes listed are Junior sizes, which run MUCH smaller than women's sizes. The hoodie was very nice, just too small. If you order this hoodie, I would suggest ordering a size or two bigger than you normally would."
340479,0,"This is a real shame, it is a great pedometer but then they put it in a poorly designed holster that keeps falling off your belt or edge of garment. A weak spring clip makes this pretty much useless."
2714,1,I was looking for a simple way to park my new Bianchi roadie and thought this may do the trick- it did. Extremely well made (for a BB stand) with a non-marring coating anywhere the stand touches the frame. Picks the back wheel up far enough to easily make drivetrain adjustments as well as remove the rear wheel.Best stand at nearly any price- but for under $10
23694,1,"I was looking for a helmet for my 1 year old. After reading reviews on Amazon, I choose this one. It is a very nice helmet and adjusts easily. he doesn't mind wearing it."
119166,0,"I bought this for my 7-year old son. The coloring/style is very cool (apparently, since it was stolen shortly after he got it)! I guess the only things I didn't like about the bag were (1) that the lid doesn't stay open when the bag is unzipped and (2) it's an odd shape to try to fit down into a backpack. My son loved it though."
104468,0,"Good product, a bit bulky than I think. I can mount it on top or down tube only because of the length"
311323,0,"This lock is good for a fast run into a store, bar, etc. I would only suggest using this in a public place to deter people from stealing it. I would not use it when you cant keep an eye on the scooter. The worst part of this lock is the fact it does not protect the contents of your ice chest! Your beer will be ripped off!"
47177,0,"I'm not quite sure what can be said about this hoodie other than the fact that somehow a unisex 3X adult size still was small enough for people to think that I was wearing my wife's clothes.Okay, so the hoodie is pink. But I like pink.Still, the fabric is not thick and the sizing runs small. If you're overweight like I am, this hoodie will leave nothing to the imagination."
120250,0,"I brought this on performancebike for $30(first week of May, 2010). I read some reviews about this and it looks good but when you place the battery(2 AA) in and tighten the cap. It doesn't really snuggle in and it feels like the cap will pop out if you hit a pot hole or go long distances when your riding. Well that's my opinion. They should really need to fix that part, otherwise then that it's pretty good."
48147,0,Have had it for over a year and have not had any problems. I wish I would have got a heavier one but this is nice to carry around the house over my head for 20 minutes to get a burn.
106107,0,"I know, you'll say ""Well don't you know what an inch is?"" Of course, but jesus! This thing is huge. Way too big for a simple keychain. It's been relegated to my car's glove box. I should have bought the smaller one."
130709,0,"The lock works well to secure only the bike in the first spot. But, when the rack is folded down, the lock can fall out of the rack and drag on the ground causing the lock core to fall out onto the highway and disappear forever. I had to buy a replacement and I have resorted to wrapping the lock around the main support and then locking it in place."
205775,0,"Fit was OK.Bike Rack was a bit flimsy, but held up with one bike on it for a 200 mile trip on the back of a 1999 Chev Tracker."
490614,0,"Bought two flashlights because of the great reviews. They don't really hold a charge that long. A hefty price for an over rated product.I'm sorry I bought two flashlights,I expected more for the money."
262214,0,"overall, it's ok. its good if you want to get into airsoft, but don't know if you'll like airsoft. this is a good gun to get if you're new and you want to get used to airsoft guns. the accessories are cheap and the laser ran out of battery in no time, or maybe it broke, i dont know i just stopped using it. the battery is inside the rail adapter system, and its a little tricky to remove the rails and put them back in. to put them back in, you need to just apply some pressure to pop it into place, although at first, it will feel like you're about to break it. the magaines hold barely anything. if you shoot on full automatic then you're out of bbs in 30 seconds, so buy like 2 or 3 more mags. its a little hard to pry open the little thing housing the hop-up. for the price, its definatly worth it, scince i have friends who bought worse guns for more money. if you're going up against serious airsoft collectors, then you have no chance of winning. its good for a few skirmishes here and there with other friends who have ok guns. compared to other guns around the same price range, it's really good, but compared to most airsoft guns, it's not."
160578,0,"The movement of this watch is great - nice smooth second hand sweep. However, the design is a little clunky for my tastes and it just didn't feel right. I returned it and will probably buy another Tag Heuer."
313512,0,"The shorts fine good enough. They aren't made of the highest quality materials, hence the price. My only real complaint is that the back label is scratchy and not easy to remove. Otherwise, functional running shorts."
455589,0,"I didn't want to pay alot, and I didn't. Ended up with what I expected. It's light weight and I expect it won't stand up to much use, but I was looking for something more visual than functional-i.e. we don't lie on it, it just looks nice out in the yard."
80303,1,Item was well made and shipped very promptly. This club-cover was given as a gift to a golfer who really liked it. A unique web-site with a wide variety of selections ... highly recommended.
39046,2,"After the first time I used, next day I observed a stain at the white Stripe! I hate this product"
198861,0,"I was pleased initially b/c it is much better than my worn out 20 yr old saddle. However, possibly due to cheap material.. the seat area where my pelvic bone sat sank lower than the front which applied pressure in areas where I prefer relief. This happened with just one short 14 mile test ride. I will not recommend this to anyone else unless you just want a cheap seat for maybe a 5 mile or less stroll once in a while."
191225,2,"I used this anchor for less than 30 minutes before it, and my umbrella, blew into the lake and sank. One wind gust was all it took, and poof, everything was gone."
493704,1,"I was nearly obsessed with getting a shaving sharp knife edge on my blades. I guess it's a guy thing. I looked at so many Youtube videos where they would make a few passes on a stone then cut paper into fine strips with no effort. After purchasing so many tools, I tried to repeat the process, only to get it sharp enough to cut paper on every second or third try. Mostly it would just tear the paper.I don't know what possessed me to try this tool, but I can happily report I have been sharpening like a madman and creating those tiny little paper strips to my heart's content. This is important because so many of my daily uses are things like cutting vegetables in the kitchen, opening letters and packages, etc. None of these are heavy tasks, but they require a very sharp blade.So if you bought a pocket or kitchen knife/knives then became disappointed you could never quite get the original edge back on it, then your journey has ended.Be patient and follow the instructions exactly, and you will be impressed.Highly recommended!"
282534,1,"The build quality is not great on these, but for what they are I have no complaints. They were most certainly worth every penny. They mount firmly and haven't run out of batteries after months of daily use. I intend to use these for a long time!"
144587,0,"The pulse check is a nice feature at the end of your walk/run - while not 100% accurate; it does you a good general idea of your pulse rate.Before making a purchase, place special emphasis on thedurability of the item. This pedometer is missing some of the features I would like like BMI."
353457,0,"Bought this because I heard a short portion at my chiropractor's office and loved it. If you were into chanting, this might be what you want. I thought they would vary it a bit- not so."
252636,1,I'm a big guy so I was not sure what to expect. Once I figured out what to wear with the flannel inner lining it was great. The bag worked good for me at 6'-3&#34; and 280 lbs. I would definitely purchase this bag again.
29681,0,"I received this item and it looked in fine shape. However, when I filled it up for the first time all the CO2 blew out of it instantly. When I looked at it to see what was wrong I noticed that the pin valve was bent so it didn't seal shut. I'm going to have it looked at to see if it can be fixed this next week. I cannot speak for all tanks like this or about the company itself because this is the first I have used. Just saying what happened. Tank does seem nice and durable besides the bent valve."
12539,2,"This is the sleeveless version of the Steen's Mountain jacket. Runs a size big (5'7"" 160 lbs, small was loose). No drawcord in hem is less than stellar. Useless against wind. I'm having to edit my review because the stitching is coming loose around the bottom of the zipper. It's not only fraying, it's also interfering with the zipper operation. I hope Amazon will take it back."
28581,0,This is a nice little axe. It came sharp and stayed that way while splitting some wood chunks for the grill. The sheath was an obvious after thought because if you put it on your belt the axe will slide right out of it. It would have rated 4 or maybe even 5 stars had it not been for the lame fitting sheath.
3845,1,"This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt! Their first game is tomorrow, can't wait to see him play in it. Fits a perfectly. We bought a large."
375177,1,"I've been a pool lap swimmer for well over 30 years. And, in all of that time, I have constantly struggled with swim caps that were too thin and just to darn skimpy - meaning they inched up on my head constantly. That created a frustrating swim and required frequents stops for cap adjustments. But, not any more! Thanks to a tip from one of my swimming buddies, who was wearing an ""Aqua Sphere Aqua Glide silicone swim cap,"" I'm happily swimming away without fights with my swimming cap. A simple thing to make me smile."
489765,1,"My six year old and I play this game quite often. There is a slight learning curve (my son was shooting when he meant to be passing) but it isn't too rough. I've seen more complicated games.This game is pretty fun. The biggest thing I like about this game (what sold me on the game) was my ability to play on the Internet. So after I picked this up I told my brother in the next state to pick up a copy as well and we've met online a couple of times to play a quick game. The gameplay across the Internet is pretty good.... though sometimes things will get a bit choppy which is surprising because my brother and I both have high speed Internet connections. I wish they would do this with more games.I like the other playing modes as well... there is even a 2-on-2 street basketball game you can play. I really like this, it is a lot of fun and a great way to put in a quick game with my son.All of the main characters are there and look very realistic. It amazes me how I look more at the players than their numbers to pass to the right guy.Speaking of passing, this can be a bit frustrating at times. It will sometimes not go to the person you want it to go to and the passes look very unrealistic at times. It makes intercepting the ball when playing the computer (and sometimes humans) a little bit easy.Overall, great game. If they make NBA 2K4, I'll be looking forward to it!"

466247,1,I was more than a little desperate for a nice NFL Indianapolis Colts present to give to my son-in-law for Christmas.I decided to look on Amazon and came across this tankard style coffee mug that came in all the NFL teams - YIPPY! When I got the mug today I was very happy with it - it is even nicer looking than pictured and the company went to greatlengths to package it carefully for mailing. No mother-in-law jokes are gonna be coming my way this year![[ASIN:B0002JALNA]]
193745,0,"I found this bag for under $25, for the price it meets my needs for carrying my bowling ball. I could have just put a foam liner in one of my gym bags it I thought about it. I like the room that it has for shoes and extra stuff but the bag does not hold it's shape well and I don't think it will be my last bag that I buy. Again, for the price and the room for shoes and extras, it's not a bad bowling bag."
189388,1,Don't always have heat when building houses. It's cold this winter and glad that they came in when they did
438155,1,"I am not a hard core mountain biker, but I like to get out every once in a while and hit the trails. I use my bike more to get a little excersize by riding into work a few times a week. This rack is perfect for that kind of thing. I can strap on a little bag with my laptop and bike lock in it. The included bungee isn't enough to hold it, but with another small bungee it can be secured pretty well. The rack attaches very well, and there is no wobble or slipage on my seat post. It fit my seat post without one of the shims though, so I don't know if that makes a difference. The shims are basically a thin piece of rubber in case the seat post is too small, and they seem like they would not cause any issues when I inspected them. I am going to buy the laptop bag by topeak at some point as well, as then it won't require any bungee at all, but the bag is still about $90, so that will wait for a bit.All in all, a great rack for a small load, which you can remove in about 5 seconds when you don't want it. And a great price too."
17200,0,"This looks real good, feels reel good, but there are some loose threads that seem to me will lead to it self-destructing prematurely. More comfortable than some other brands though."

347880,0,"As far as cheap straps go, yeah, this will work. But there are tons of straps out there that can be bought for a few bucks more that will be well worth it. Fender logo is one perk, but it's pretty cheaply made and it tangles/twist often. You can't do better for a cheap strap but you can do a heck of a lot better with a few more bucks. This one is serviceable around the house but not to gig with. That's my stand."
351608,0,"Functionally, it's a back up, and I wouldn't want to wire it from scratch...guess that's why more of em' are wireless these days! I'm pretty sure if you buy a N.O.S unit like this, you're not going to get mfr. customer service..they tell you to 'go to your dealer if you have warranty&#34;...which in this case was like 2004?! Thanks Blackburn (model out of production anyway)."
488686,1,"This is a very great pair of shorts, I really like it. It is basically the same as columbia's ROC pants in shorts, with the same very cool zipped compartment inside the right pocket.The fabric is very soft and comfy. The only thing I would criticize is that the button has a tendency to pop easily after a while, so you kind of need a belt to prevent this.I would also recommend you check the color in a store or somewhere before ordering because it is hard to get a good idea from the picture. For example, sage has a greeny taint I do not see on my computer screen. Flax and fossil are pretty accurate but I guess it depends on your computer."
128189,2,"Upon receiving these shorts, I was disappointed to find that they have no pockets. The website description didn't mention pockets at all, so i assumed they were there."

I have tried different ways of doing it, but it doesn't seem to work. I was pretty disappointed at the buy.."
206477,1,The only thing I was disappointed in is that this t-shirt is quite short. I had thought it would be of 'regular' length instead the length is to the top of waistband length. Customer service was great and I received this product in a very timely manner.

7044,0,"I bought my first pair of this pants not too long ago and I really like it. Although, I think that they are sized bigger than the usual pairs I buy, let say from Levi's. I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly. Style looks good too,so if you intend to buy one, check out the sizes carefully so you can fully enjoy them."

415863,0,"More than enough pockets, including two hidden inside, to satisfy just about any situation.The fabric could be a little heavier; I'm afraid it may not hold up well under extreme conditions, though I will have to use it for a while in order to evaluate its durability. I can see the weight being an advantage in hot weather, though.The 'combat' part of the name could only refer to the style - it is too light-weight to be of military level quality, but it is constructed well enough to justify the decent price."

351626,0,"I bought this light because it is one of the very few LED taillights listed on Steven Scharf's taillights page as good enough not to be considered a toy, and it's the least expensive of those. It is definitely very bright, and well protected against the environment with its rubber gasket and 3-screw closure.If you want to mount it on a belt, or a fabric loop on a rack trunk, no problem, the belt clip is built in. If you want to mount it on a seatpost or seatstay, also no problem, there's a very nice post mount with a secure, positive adjustment for vertical angle. Weirdly, it attaches by the belt clip, so that even the post/stay mount depends on the durability of the belt clip (which other reviewers have not found very dependable).Weirdest of all, if you have a rear rack with a standard drilled taillight/reflector mount at the back, you're out of luck: the one thing that doesn't come with this taillight is a way of attaching to a standard taillight mount. It also doesn't include any passive reflector surface (as the 4DToplight does, for example) so it needs to be combined with a standard reflector.Well, the belt clip seems to be attached by 3 screws (one from the inside) and I can probably fabricate something to replace it and make a nice permanent mount for it and a couple of reflectors from the junk box. But with the extra effort I really won't have saved anything compared to spending the extra money on one of the other choices in the first place."
379889,0,"I'm picky when it comes to tanks. Fit is priority and this fits well. Not too tight and the armholes are sufficient without forcing a wardrobe malfunction. That's the good.It's a bit odd that they call it ""heavyweight"". If this is heavyweight, the lightweight tank must be saran wrap because this is the thinnest shirt I own, including a 15 year old tee that I wear all the time. This tank is a bit revealing but that just may be the color I bought (yellow). Overall, it's ok though. I'd buy another in a darker color, mainly because of the fit. I do wish it were a little thicker material, not just for coverage but because I'd like it to last longer."
198267,0,This ab machine works good but is very wobbly and not very sturdy. I would definitely buy this machine but only for about $150 it is really worth half of its value. I am not complaining about the workout becuz like I said it does it's job but when it comes to physical value with sturdiness etc. after putting it together and trying it out it will tip on someone who is bigger. Maybe more ideal for a women. I can't stress enough.. Buy this machine for a good ab workout but don't pay $300 it's just not worth that kind of money.

I can easly be playing cricket in the backyard with the kids wothout worrying about damanging my shorts and then wear them to a social BBQ with friends and still look very smart.They are cut slightly shorter than typical cargo shorts, and are more tailored to fit than a typical cargo short.All in all they are excellent value, look smart and are very durable."
189348,1,"After using synthetic socks for activities from in-line skating to hiking and loving them, I found out about Smartwool socks after bying a Smartwool zip t-shirt for use as a mid layer for outdoor winter activities. These socks are incredibly comfortable with great padding on the bottom. They also kept my feet nice and warm when hiking in the snow with it being 20 degrees outside. I would highly recommend them."

296145,0,"These socks are nice and thick, but don't stay up for anything. They are the same width from the toes to the top and have no contour to help with the transition between foot and ankle, so they are very loose around the ankles. If I wear them in the house without shoes, I always end up 3 inches of sock out in front of my toes. They definitely could use some fitting help..."
101838,0,I went out snowshoeing but I spent more time rebuckling the straps than I did enjoying the snow. This size snowshoe is not for any snow deeper than 6 inches.
178360,1,"I purchased several of these GOGO thick solid color headbands and am highly satisfied. I sweat a lot when I work out and always wear a headband to keep the sweat out of my eyes. These fit nicely, are absorbent, and I like the width; lots of color choices, and the price is excellent (under $3 including shipping). Would definitely recommend."
367321,1,"I don't no where to start !!!! OK BUY ONE!!!! this is one of the best camping investments Ive ever made. Light weight but durable and versatile. Just got back from a camping trip and i cant wait to use this again. I have a Weber charcoal grill at home, and I think it will sit on top so I can use the rotissorie on top to do chicken or even a small split turkey. The grill top is big enough to get plenty of meat on at once if your feeding alot of people. I sprayed pam cooking spray on the grill area after i burned off the coating on the grill and clean-up was easy,I used a warm damp cloth, and stuff came right off. I coated the grill area with pam again, before i put it away to prevent rusting. This would make a great gift for anyone who does alot of bbq or camping."

411529,0,"It's really too soon to review, but here are my first impressions. I paid extra for two-day delivery (Amazon was the seller) and it did get here in two days. The box was pretty beaten up, but nothing was damaged. I was impressed with how easy it was to put together. Other than three bolts, the thing is pre-assembled. The instructions are pretty lousy and I can see why a couple people couldn't figure out how to make it slide. After a small amount of head scratching, I found that it slides fairly smoothly and seems solid.So far my only complaint, and it's a big one, is that the cheap (made in China) plastic, rubber, and foam pads reek of chemical smell and will stink up the whole house. I put mine in a spare bedroom and it about makes my eyes water when I open the door. Washing it hasn't helped. I should have learned from a ""power tower"" I bought a couple years ago. It smelled the same way and still does. It can't be healthy to breathe that in; it makes me a believer in people who I used to roll my eyes at when they talk about a ""sick"" house. I would not buy it again."
9535,0,I had a vest like this one from about 5 years ago but it wore out and I wanted to get a replacement. I got it and it is as warm as the last one but the material seems a bit thin. Not sure how long it is going to last but 5 years would really surprise me.
209738,1,"This product along with the pump came in 2 days!!! For the price I think it is a very good investment. I do a pilates mat workouts 3 times a week and see definition from that, but I'm hoping this will increase the definition I'm seeing. The pump was compatible with this product. The only problem is the ball plugs(They give you two)stick out a little. But even if you sit on the plug it doesn't hurt, just pushes into the ball. I have not notice how fast the ball deflates but the pump is so easy to use. Or you can use the straw they give you to pump it back up. No time at all. I plan to use the pump to inflate anything and everything.For the price of both and shipping, this was less than the bender ball."
25502,2,"I bought one of these compasses for my car. It is completelyinaccurate --- so much so that if I'm heading east it saysI'm going south! You are supposed to be able to connect thecompass to a power source so that it's illuminated, but theinstructions contain no mention of how to do that. In sum,buying this ""compass"" is like flushing money down the toilet."
188723,1,The kids just love playing with these disc shooters. They have great distance and the foam disc won't hurt anything. They have hours of great fun.

232742,0,descent rag but not the best if u are on a tight budget ok if not sppring for rustys rags
220829,1,"I like this product. I had a hard time convincing my camping friends that it was a good thing - they used it to store all the towels and washing tools and stuck with our old system of large pots and plastic bowls. Oh well, you can lead the horse to water, you just can't make it drink. I would recommend this for whatever way works for you because I'm a gadget person and I don't think the campsite needs to be messy just because we're in the woods."
418705,0,"I needed more running/work out shorts, and I couldn't find anything to really beat this price. I love soffes, specifically because they ""move with your body"". They're normally not too baggy, falling down, or not fitting in those ""awkward"" areas.Either I've gotten to be a smaller size, or these shorts are knock-offs...because these shorts don't fit me like my other soffes. They're awkwardly baggy in the crotch, the bum isn't defined, the legnth is a bit longer than the others (even when ""properly"" rolled up).The main pro is that the material is very soft and comfortable. So I could see myself wearing these to the gym, and maybe even to bed on a warmer night.So bittersweet? I guess."
39488,1,I love this! I have had it for 3 weeks and so far it is perfect! No squeaks at all. I have been wanting something that I could keep in my living room and exercise while my family and I are just sitting around watching tv. I do it at least 2 times a day for 15 min each. If you are not used to using a stair stepper this might not be the one for you because you do not have support. My mom has some neck problems and she tried it and complained that it hurt her back because of having no support such as handles to hang on to. A great workout!

129267,1,"The material this cheesehead is made out of isn't as nice as the old cheesehead we had. It does look nice, but you can tell why it isn't as costly as other ones you can find online. It also will fall off your head if you move around more than just a little. I mean its a nice product for what it is, GO PACKERS, and for a decoration, which is mainly what it will be in our house it works great, but if you want the real deal to wear around, I would go for the actual NFL one. Shipped fast though which was nice!"
321056,0,"I bought this coat in both blue and green - after reading the reviews that it does not have side pockets. I bought them at REI as they were on sale for 114.00. The colors are amazing - and on the first day I wore the green one I got compliments from almost everyone I ran into. I skied in it at Breckenridge in sub zero temperatures and it kept me very warm. I just make sure when I wear it I wear something under it that has pockets - ie: A down vest or a hoodie with pockets to keep my phone etc. If running around town it is not as big a deal as I usually have my purse.So as long as you are willing to deal with the no pocket part - it is a really, really cute jacket, very flattering, great colors, and suprisingly warm. However having said all of that I would not buy it unless it is on sale..."
168083,0,These Basketballs are reasanoble but not great. I ordered them for the basketball team Penta (That's in the Netherlands) but these balls are not great as indoor balls. Next time I'll order the official NBA balls only those are more expensive.The leather is not great but if you're looking for an allround ball you can order this one. The silver NBA is vanishing very fast by the way.excuse me for my bad English but i'm not a US citizen (I'm Dutch)
130704,0,"This locking set works well with the Yakima Double-Down hitch mounted bike rack. It is definitely needed to secure your entire rack to the hitch as well as the bikes to the rack. There is still an exposed bolt at the hinge of the rack that someone with the right sized wrench could remove - but that still leaves them with only half of a rack and they would still have to cut off the connecting lock. As with most things in life, you are really just keeping honest people honest. If someone really wants to get something, they will find a way no matter what.My only complaint about this lock is that you cannot prevent someone from taking the bike lock out of it's nesting space when not engaged as a lock for your bike. You have to lock it to itself, which renders it's nesting capabilities useless. But it's not a terrible thing. I'd still buy it again - I just think it's slightly poor design when you have a built in nesting space to stow the lock."
408637,0,"This is a very useful means for on the go strength training. It has a DVD that explains basic core development. It is durable. I have had it now for four years and it still works like new.However they have since come out with a better version of this project. The hooks on this scratch and actually draw blood when they scrape against your skin. This unit comes with only one door attachment, and the handles are not of great quality."

365619,1,I like these shorts because you can put them on to go for a walk or wear them to sleep in. They are comfortable and definately something I will have several pairs of!
61051,2,"These breeches were NOT cotton. They were a polyester/spandex blend, so I returned them. If polyester works in your climate, they were very nice breeches, but in 110+ heat, poly is a no-no. The seller said they would fix the link to the product description, and they may have, but be aware."
246880,0,"Although some of the exercises were modified for men - ""the hundred"" with hand weights - the overall video content was basic. Some of the standard ""beginning Pilates"" videos posed a greater challenge than this one."
328777,0,"Shorts are a mesh that lays flat on the thigh when exercising. They're not super-cool, with a lot of air movement, and can feel warm.There are no pockets, or any features other than being elasticized with a flat-woven drawstring.Basic shorts for workouts. Nothing you'd wear to the corner store, probably not something you'd do yardwork in."

81350,1,The Columbia name is quality at fair price. I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good.
184160,0,This lock does the job. It is a good U-Lock so thieves can not cut through it. However it is cheap. On one night with rain and then a freeze the lock had ice in it and the key would not turn. I had to twist the key for 10 minutes to get it to work. Not good for use in cold weather but if you want a cheap U-Lock this is a great buy.
152429,0,"I bought this for my daughter, and it's kind of thin, more for spring time. It runs small, the size medium is the same size as a 14-16 in childrens's so I had to exchange it for an extra large, which is more like a real size medium. Keep that in mind when you make your order. Really nice hoody though, I reordered another one for her. She loves it."
394291,0,Every thing else is right with these shorts aside from padding which feels like a piece of cardboard in your pants. I've washed these about 20 times and they're just starting to soften up.
317360,0,"I got this gun two days ago. Its not bad but i have had better. It has nice looks and was pretty intimidating to my friends during yesterday's backyard game, but i had to constantly change mags b/c of the small capacity of it. I didnt want to use auto fire b/c it ran out extremely quickly so i played sniper with single shots. The best thing about this gun is the looks while the worst is the small capcity mag. I dont know if it was worth the money but i am not complaining"
508042,0,"Not the best fabric or deal at $29 (in Oct '12), but my son needed it soon. He needed a 2XT but settled for a 3XT. It shrunk a little in length. My son also thinks the neck opening is too tight."
483654,0,"First, let me say this is one of two identical watches I purchased. The first runs like a champ! The second one has issues. I gave the first watch to my dad and it runs like a house-afire. The one I kept for myself goes blank; resets itself and sometimes fails to respond to commands. I don't know why this is but it'll have to go back to Casio for service."
57909,1,"I love this headlamp! It's easy to use, and has stood up to mild abuse over my last 3 camping trips. It is PLENTY bright, I almost always use the lowest setting, but I still appreciate that it has 3 intensities. The flip-down red filter is great for extra-late nights around the campfire. My first headlamp was a cheap piece of junk from Wal-Mart, and I got what I paid for. This Petzl has made me proud."
356475,2,"The photo of this cooler suggests its a short, wide little jug. The reviewers who used it for their dogs, which was my purpose in purchasing it, spoke very highly about it. The cooler I received was taller and narrower which would make my dog's ability to drink from it more difficult. Additionally, I was put off by the odor inside after the cap was screwed off. Wound up returning it. The shipping was more than the cost of the cooler, so I wound up paying approximately $18.00 for shipping (both ways) for a $10.00+/- cooler. Oh, well."

290431,0,"The jacket looked great. It wasn't too fitted but it looked good on. Had room to put a sweater under. I didn't like that it made swishing sounds (like a plastic bag) when I moved, but I guess that's what you get for it being perfectly waterproof.I ended up returning it though because I happened to find the exact same style of jacket without the brand name (lightweight, 100% waterproof, fits into its own pocket) at Winners. At Winners it was on sale for $30 rather than $80. I couldn't care less for brand names so I went with the Winners one."
394742,2,Your ad says select the model you want. There is no way that I can find to select a model therefore I will not purchase one. If I could assure the procurement of an sx1 I would be very interested.

334910,0,"The bike rack itself was good enough. I did end up switching to a side mount, because I kept grinding off my tail. Not to mention it's difficult to strap down the board well enough without leaving marks. To solve the marks I would wrap my board in my towel."

115399,0,"I've used this as a helmet cam for kayaking. The mounting was pretty easy. The controls take a little getting used to (to use them blindly-without removing the helmet). The resulting video is very good, good frame rate, good quality, water drips off readily. No problems with waterproofing. The video has a relatively small field of view (Not wide angle), but the frame rate is great. The only downside, so far is the audio is basically useless, very, very muffled. I would also recommend getting the newer version of the camera if you want more that 60 minutes of video, as this cam is limited to a 2gb SD card. But, for the price, this guy is tough, waterproof, and provides great quality video."
332006,0,"I didn't find many if any reviews for TKO speed bags so here we go. The product itself looks good, it takes a beating well, is made of durable materials, and the bladder holds the air just fine... now for the reasons it gets a three... one - the triple reinforced leather hanging loop at the top is thick and big... too big for a chain link swivel (you have to scrunch it up to fit), two - I got the 9x6 which is the size of EVERLAST's 10x7, three - it's rebounds are sporadic and unpredictable (seemed to get a little better with use and breaking it in but very little), and it hangs a wee bit lop sided. The product itself isn't bad just needs some more work, I got an EVERLAST 9x6 and it is FANTASTIC... the difference was night and day. Try it at your own risk... I did... lol"

17013,0,"I don't know why everyone thought the headlight is so dim. I think it's pretty good. So is the rear light, which has four different on/flashing modes. When my kids use these, they are pretty visible, which is what I want at dusk, even though they are on sidewalks. We've also used them at night and they are bright.My only problem with these is the installation. My son has a 20 inch bike and my daughter has a 12 inch bike. The front and rear lights don't mount securely because the diameter of the mounts is larger than the diameter of the frames. I emailed Schwinn to ask for some more rubber inserts (they came with one for each mount) to make them fit and they told me to call up Pacific Cycle. The lady there told me Pacific Cycle bought up the company that made the lights so they have no replacement parts whatsoever. So, you will get no help from the company if you need any parts or if this doesn't fit your bike. I did a workaround by inserting some felt pieces I found around the house but I will have to look for something rubber, because felt has no grip.Oh, and the circumference of the children's bike frames is 2 3/4""."
338789,1,"I got this because I knew I needed to start walking and I wasn't having much luck really keeping track of the distances I was traveling. If you are a person who likes to track information, or need something to monitor your progress so that you actually get out there and start taking those 10,000 steps a day--this is the pedometer for you. I am hooked. I can see my daily progress, compare it to previous days (up to 7 days back), check distance, number of steps, time walked or run, time of day, and kcal burned. Set up was easy (and I always have to read the instructions twice--but not this time), and it's a snap to use. It's also small enough that I can just clip it on to my waistband and it's not noticeable under clothing. You can also put it in your pocket and have it work that way.This is the only thing that has actually gotten me out there walking nearly every day. My husband got so curious about it he wanted to borrow it for a day. I finally got him his own, and he's now as engaged by it as I am, and does his daily walks. As far as I'm concerned, whatever gets you out there works. If this is all it takes to get us motivated to be healthy, then it's a cheap price to pay.By the way, this is the pedometer that is used by dieters on the Discovery Health Channel show: You on a Diet."
319477,0,"I shouldn't complain, because it is light and easily adjustable, but I will. When new I experienced problems attaching it to my helmet, finally solved by using some double sticky foam tape over a wider area than the mirror fixture. Later, I would lose the mirror by knocking it off when on a trail, by striking branches, etc. I bought replacement mirrors. Finally I tied a short piece of string to both mirror and mount so if it popped off it would hang there to be popped in again. When the mount loosened up over time I tightened it by threading a nut over it, which worked until the last time when that snapped the mount off. Another problem is that the mirror is plastic which leads it to scratches, fogginess and discoloration. I used it well for over a year, but now I am moving on."

64002,1,"Quite a nice knife overall, definitely reflects Kershaw quality through and through. This knife is truly designed for a rescue worker, instead of the usual sharp point on most knives, this blade has a blunt tip. The reasoning behind this is obvious, whilst you are trying to cut a person out of whatever, the last thing you want to do it stick them with a knives sharp point. The speed assist opening is pretty cool, just a slight nudge on the blade thumb stud, and 'voila' the blade springs open. Kind of a cross between a switch blade and a manual opening knife.The price is right as well, far less than a Puma rescue knife (which runs $100.00 or more)"
32352,1,"Starting my new years resolution a month late, and needed something to protect my hands from getting cut when using power tools and the like.

310885,2,"Well, this item is a good concept, just not at an ocean beach. This might be good at a lake where there isn't much wind. It was such a pain to put up because it was windy. And even when it was up we had to pile all our stuff inside to keep it from blowing away. The sand bags weren't much help."

109415,0,"This frame came to me in a timely fashion and consisted of all the components that the seller said would come with it. And with that, the praise is complete. Unfortunately, this particular ALICE frame isn't nearly as durable as the older frames I used on active duty. Within minutes of me unboxing the frame, a rivet holding one piece of metal to another failed. Alright, no big deal...I'll fix that. However, in the 5 months that I've owned this frame, two more rivets have failed. It's important to note, that in these 5 months, the frame with my ALICE pack attached to it, has been in storage in a closet. It has not been used outdoors. It hasn't even carried a load. I expect things to fail when they've been abused or handled roughly in extreme environments, but to fail while being stored in a climate-controlled closet is a bit weird. I work construction, so I'm not against fixing these failed rivets, myself, but I don't think after 5 months of non-use, the frame should require fixing. So, anyone interested in buying a frame like this should be advised that these newer ones, aren't made as durably as the old ones."

It's a bit awkward to use at different angles and can easily put too much pressure on the tire stem--it actually ripped one of my tubes. I kept it because it's useful in a pinch, and because I was being too careless with it when I put a hole in my tube. But I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone purchase it."
438694,1,"For the outdoor veggie this is a tasty treat that is easy to prepare, light, and keeps a long time without refrigeration. Don't have to spend an hour or so boiling beans and rice. Boil a couple of cups of water, add, wait a few minutes and you have a rather tasty meal with enough calories to keep you going for a while. Add some minute rice and you can stretch this even more. Other vegetables added optionally such as tomatoes, carrots, celery, etc. This is a good buy for camping and is much cheaper than most freeze dried foods."

470801,0,"These are comfortable grips with one drawback. On the Rossi 38 special, five-shot model I own, the grips interfere with ejection and use of a speed loader. Solving the ejection problem is just a matter of rotating the cylinder. The speed loader impediment can only be solved by shaving off part of the grip as far as I can tell. I haven't been willing to do it - yet."

360672,2,"This product needs two design changes in my opinion. First, the bar should be shorter so you can use it barefooted. Second, the hinge that the bar swivels down on should be stiffer (or latch) so the arm will remain in the upright position when the unit is stowed. Mine falls down all the time and on one occasion produced an angry wife with a stubbed toe."

472342,1,"The title says it all. For the price? You can't beat this watch. As many before me have said, this looks EXACTLY like a Rolex Submariner. Only difference is the branding and parts. This is my second Invicta watch and my first automatic watch. I'm loving it. Having it for less than a week, I can't give a full review. But here are my initial impressions.Came in the usual yellow Invicta watch box. The watch was literally covered in plastic. The band, the face, the clasp, everything.The watch is thick. At 14mm, it's the thickest watch I own for a 40mm case diameter. But since I'm never going to have my arm sticking out in front of my eyes where I can see my watch on the side, it doesn't bother me. When I'm typing or sitting down, you can't even tell the thickness of the watch. Looks just like an ordinary watch. They say big watches are ""in"", and the biggest I own is a 45mm. This is definitely a few notches down from what I'm use to, but I wanted something simple and this watch meets that expectation.The magnifying portion, or ""eye"", for lack of a better word, works as it was designed to. The date is clear and easy to read.The bezel is really tough to move. Maybe I haven't broken it in yet, but I have to firmly grip the edges just to get it to move. Then again, I'm not a diver and I plan to use this watch as my everyday watch.So far, there are more pros than cons. I will give an updated review once I've put some miles on this watch. Like I said, it's a simple and affordable watch. I don't know about you, but I rather pay $65 than $5,000-$6,000 for a Rolex."

415131,2,"I dont own this but my relitives do. It is absoloutely terrible. They say it is 50 inches long. Now take a good look at that picture. I dont know about you but that looks like a 20yr old who's torso barely fits on the board. It is increadibly small and WAY overpriced. your legs hang off the back even when your head is dangleing off the front ready to slam into whatever is in front of you. there is no steering, it breaks way too easily and is an eyesoar. Sure its somewhat fast but is ismply not worth 112 dollars, more like $30. Just stick to the cheap and replaceable foam boards, much easier to repair and WAY bigger."
223223,1,"Russell Track Pants are terrific. Cheap, comfortable, durable and last just about forever.

44118,0,"This is a spacious cooler which is why I bought it despite having another one with a handle and wheels. It does keep things cool but as other reviewers have said, the ice does all melt and would only remain unmelted to a certain degree after a day and half if one were to keep it out of the sun or heat (not left inside a warm car). My experience was just that - I had to buy new ice after day 1 (after having traveled for 9 hours in an air-conditioned car non-stop).I also agree with other reviewers that what prevents this cooler from allowing cold air to stay trapped inside of the unit are three reasons: 1. the thinner lid (thicker ones provide more insulation and hot air rises to the top as we learned in science class), 2. the fact that there is nothing lining the edges of the lid so when it closes, it's airtight and 3. one must use a strap to clamp the lid tightly downwards (there isn't enough weight on the lid to seal the cooler tight)"
237540,0,"This Pilates workout is sort of an odd blend. On the one hand, instructor Jillian Hessell spends a lot of time focused on the breath, which would be very helpful to Pilates beginners. Furthermore, she provides a rather abbreviated mat sequence--for example performing ""50s"" instead of the tradional hundred exercise and doing only two quick side series exercises. On the other hand, she does not give much detailed instruction about form, shows no modifications, and performs a few of the exercises at a very quick pace, including the criss-cross and swan dive, which would make this workout more ideally suited to advanced beginners or lower intermediates (most likely on a light day).The DVD breaks the workout into three segments, Breathing, Matwork, and Centering. The Breathing segment, about 4.5 minutes long, is performed seated in a chair, and it includes both breathing instruction and a few simple stretches. The 16.5 minute Matwork sequence begins with a controlled sit-down and roll-back. A band is used to modify the roll-up and single leg cirlces, and few repetitions are performed for the exercises. Finally, the workout concludes with a 3-minute Centering section, which involves additional breathing instruction, basic stretches, and a tiptoe balance, all in a standing position.This 26-minute workout would probably be best suited to Pilates beginners who have some prior familiarity with the Pilates exercises and are looking for a relatively basic workout."
379307,1,"I bought this for my young nephews to practice soccer. It is very portable and you can take it where you want to. It is flexible and when the ball hits it, it gives slightly and that helps it to not fall over. Great net for training and practicing.."
469082,0,This stock looks 10 times better than the original for sure. It took HEAVY modification to fit my gun and even then it is not as good as I want. It is almost like the stock is warped. I think it is kind of a gamble when you click &#34;Add to Cart&#34; with this Item...

For the first 2 days, the built-in iPod connection worked, but there were challenges requiring that the iPod or iPhone couldn't have a protective case on it in order to properly plug in to the pack. Within another week the remote control built into the shoulder strap stopped working, and sound is only intrmittent through the earphones. We're going to take one more look at it this weekend to see if we can fix it, but if not we'll be returning it to try another one. If the 2nd one doesn't work either, we'll return it too and give up on this model."

That said, the strap on the first one I bought broke the very first time I put it on... I sent it back for a refund, and got a new one, and I've been happy since. I've definitely given it reason for a bit of wear and tear in the last six months, but it has held up well."
452099,0,these shorts run small and the elastic in the waistband is not very nice quality - kinda stiff and chunky. For athletis shorts to be worn exercising or working in the yard they are acceptable but they look cheap and I wouldn't wear them in public.
405333,1,"Our daughter loves this bag (we also bought green ones for our 2 boys). They are quality made and the perfect size for our kids, all younger than 6. I would imagine they will fit up to a 8 year old pretty comfortably though. The bear does not come with the bag as shown. It just has a pocket kids can stuff a lovey or trinkets in. Great for the occaisional camping trip. I just wish they had a better color selection."
296726,2,"This is good if you go luxury camping (with a tent, etc.).This thing is tiny. I bought it to bring backpacking/survival camping and found it absolutely useless. Everything is soo small.

400079,2,I got a puncture in the tube on the 35th mile of a 65 mile ride. The slime tube STILL ENDED UP FLATTING because the high pressure of the tire just spit out the SLIME and the puncture didn't seal. I've owned Slime tubes for mountain bikes and they work fine for that. I rate it 1 star for road bike use...an absolute waste of money.

398117,0,"Time will tell if how well it performs but over last several hundred miles it has been excellent. Here's the thing many people don't realize: You have to replace the chain with the cassette at the same time (assuming the chain is equally worn). Otherwise you can expect a lot of chain popping. Likewise, you can't put a new chain on an old cassette. I rode my original cassette for about 2000 miles and would have kept riding it except the chain had broken too many times and could not be shortened any more.Update - after about 600 miles the pin that holds the cogs together sheared. The cassette still functions but if I remove it the cogs and spacers come apart and it's a pain to put back together."

Bought a couple of them for under twenty delivered to my house in 2008....not its tough to get your hands on one can for that which seems crazy. I work with a bunch of techs that install cctv cameras with dome housings, noticed that stopped using plexus and now that i see the price i realize why. I'll check into what they're using nowadays."

137855,2,"These shoes are suppose to be designed for kung fu/martial arts. However, they are not designed to withstand the abuse of a regular class, much less completion or sparring. The material is thin and tears easily. The outer edge that should cushion under you ankle is rigid and prevents comfortable mobility,forcing you to move as if you are walking on glass. Also, the exhorbitant restocking fee leaves you with the option of returning the shoes for a dollop of a refund, or keeping the shoes as unique bookends. I now use them to throw at stray cats in my yard. They are very effective used in that manner."

367769,1,I love the sweatpants. The waistband is wide and has a drawstring inside. The pants are a good length too. I've gotten sweatpants before from Avenue and Lane Bryant and they were always too short. I can't get tall because they are too long. But these pants are the perfect length. The material they are made with is not to thick and not too thin--just right.

It has a small blade, screwdriver/nail file, scissors (wonderful!!!) a toothpick and tiny tweezers. This very slim and compact package is just right for my pocket and it not noticible at all. Larger pocket knives tend to stick out and causing wearing issues on my slacks, but not this little guy. It's really a perfect gift too."

73433,0,"IMPORTANT - THIS PRODUCT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A LIFETIME WARRANTY (that you can actually take advantage of).So I placed my order on October 4. It arrived today, Oct 13 (9 days later). The lifetime warranty requires I fill in the usual information, but it also asks for the SERIAL NUMBER, which would be impossible to know until today. Then I have to return the warranty registration within ""10 days from the date of sale."" So, by tomorrow! I supposed if I would have filled it out early enough I could have FedEx'd it overnight. Maybe they'll accept it as long as it's postmarked tomorrow.But, I am still waiting for a Powerline Power Rack, which I also ordered on October 4 (9 days ago). And it's not going to arrive until the 16th. So how in the world am I supposed to get the serial number for the power rack in time to return the registration to the stupid company by tomorrow?I had seen the other' guy's comment about the warranty, but I am hoping it's still a good product. Because if it breaks, it really doesn't have a warranty.So I bought this knowing the warranty might be a joke. And I found out it is. But I think (I hope) I'll be happy with the product."
195663,0,"I bought the Coleman Tent Fan for a recent camping trip. The fan runs on a single D-cell battery, and is pretty simple; one on/off switch, and a flexible rubber fan blade. The magnetic mounting plate is a nice and simple solution; the plate goes on the outside of the tent wherever you choose to locate it, and the fan goes on the inside, with the magnets holding it securely in place. You have to literally twist the metal plate to remove the fan from its position, so it won't easily fall at random.The fan output isn't as much as I had hoped for. In a 3-person tent the Coleman Tent Fan will provide a nice breeze. It's strong enough to circulate the air in and around your tent, but not strong enough to say, blow your hair back in the wind. My only other complaint is that the price is a little high for a molded plastic fan. It's useful, but if you want a fan that will cool you down in hotter temperatures, try something larger than this."
127440,0,"The compact version is a smaller size mirror which is GOOD in theory, because it weighs less and drags less. BUT, the extension wire from the glasses is SHORTER which is BAD if you are older and may not be able to focus as close as you used to. The Original size is FAR better for us older bikers. If you have tried ANY helmet or glasses mount mirror and ""couldn't get used to it"" then try mounting it farther away from the eye. Even a quarter inch may make a huge difference. I wouldn't ride without this mirror (original size!). Peter"

491060,1,Great in emergencies and great for travel. The built in pressure gauge makes it more useful than CO2 cartridges when you need to top off the tires before a ride. The foot peg and T-handle make it reasonably easy to put in 110+ pounds of pressure.
219312,2,"Bought the tent to replace a smaller tent from another manufacturer, thought that the Coleman name would mean I would get a quality tent. The tent is roomy and well ventilated, however upon setting it up and attaching the rain fly to the first corner, the elastic cord pulled right out - the loop holding the cord to the rain fly was never sewn completely. Not to worry, I thought I would just use my knife to modify the defective loop by cutting a hole in it - worked - attached the cord.But - upon attaching the SECOND corner - SAME THING, the loop failed. What about the THIRD corner you ask? SAME THING! Ok, Fourth corner was different....The loop had ALREADY FAILED and the cord was already GONE, not even in the bag. I know like about everything, these are sewn in China but somebody should have caught that.If this is indicative of the kind of QC Coleman has established, I would steer clear of the brand all together.

Within two years, my watch was sent back for water in the crystal and a bezel that popped off. In addition, I find that it scratches quite easily. Do I like the watch? Yes, I'll admit it's pretty cool. However, for $150 I thought it would hold up a bit better. By comparison, my 5-year old Casio G-Shock only needed a wrist band replacement and has proven to be much tougher. However, I would still recommend the Luminox for light outdoor use. Hope this helps."

It is tricky to think it is actually accurate because when i shake it up and down as if im walking, it jumps up to 100 steps when i haven't even walked yet. Please do yourself a favor and get a pedometer that has an ""Off"" button!! Especially if you are money-conscious."

I chose the Lodge LCC3 because it met the requirements I needed as specified by the book.The cooker is fantastic! The top and bottom line up just right. I will be using this primarily for artisan bread. I want to trap the steam inside to set up the bread. It does a wonderful job. See the video which is half way through the cooking process.I want to add that if you get this cooker go to the Lodge site and read how to take care of it. You do not want to scrub this down with soap and water after cooking. The reason is that it will rust and do so almost immediately. So read up on the maintenance, and it seems like it will last a lifetime."

337723,2,"I received this item as a gift for Christmas in '06 and have used it for the entire year thus far. I thought at first I wasn't jogging as far as I normally did and started questioning how in shape I was. Then I decided that there had to be something wrong with the pedometer. I jogged with the pedometer and then drove the same route with my car. The pedometer read 1.6 miles and my car read 3.1 miles. It wasn't even close. I then checked all the settings again and they were right. I decided to walk normally with the pedometer and counted my steps to 100. The pedometer read 74 steps. This thing is supposed to be accurate up to +/-5%. I double checked my stride to make sure that it wasn't off - it was right. I think I must have gotten a total lemon. Other people seem to really like this product but I can't recommend it. It's a shame, I like all the options on it, it's just wrong."

140638,0,"I'm an exergaming junkie. Gold's Gym, My Fitness Coach, Wii Fit Plus, DDR . . . heck, I even tried some of the duds like Daisy Fuentes!I was uncertain of this game because an EA rep let us demo it for a while in a big box store, and I was less than impressed. Even the rep was intensely frustrated with the program! Still, I saw all the amazing reviews on Amazon and decided to bite the early-adopter bullet. As a true exergaming addict, I can't just leave some big piece of software out of my lineup!I keep telling myself I couldn't help it, but I'm so sorry I blew $60 on this game. If only there were a rental I could have tried first!I'll concede that it's a good workout, particularly for cardio and leg strength. And thank heavens, it strings just the workouts you want together in any order you want them. Cardio and this ability to make a routine were the two things bugging me most about Wii Fit. I realize Wii Fit Plus fixed that to a degree, but the original EA Sports Active still has them beat it these two areas.This, to my mind, earns it three stars.Now for the complaints: this isn't fun! And mind you, I play My Fitness Coach with that brutal sadist Maya, so not everything I play is a fluffy game. There are a few sports games that are mildly entertaining, but not enough, and the controls are spazzy and frustrating. Few things have me yelling at my television screen more than spazzy controls: ""I AM squatting, you pixellated piece of poo!""Sure, I'm breathing heavy by the end of a workout, but part of that is from sheer frustration! I can't stand this title, and neither can my friends. I have tried so very, very hard to at least not hate it. Alas, I've tried it on my own several times and I've put each friend I exercise through it about twice. No luck!

The lantern still works but it's now a 3-leg stool reduced to 2 legs. I'm absolutely stunned at the shoddy materials quality given the price. Mine was basically disposable.Tough to give a review.

505173,0,"I feel dumb but I didn't know that this workout video is basically just kick-boxing on crack. I'm not crazy about kick-boxing exercise videos (it's funner with a bag) so I sent it back. But if you like kick-boxing videos, this is probably the best one out there. It's just not my thing- the movements are so frenetic, I didn't feel like I was really doing anything but bouncing around a ton. The toning work out is great, the band that comes with the package is a good band, and the accompanying literature is motivating and had good nutritional advice. Chalene is a pretty good instructor, her timing is mostly on. The music isn't great, but not as horrible as it could be. All-in-all it's a fine workout program, just not the kind of movement I like."
65207,0,"I have owned my Razor A2 Kick Scooter for many years now. Being a kid, I always had to have ""the latest"", or more commonly, ""the coolest"". When all my friends began bragging about their super cool new Razor scooters, I just had to have it. I instantly found it on Amazon and spent all my Amazon gift certificates I had been saving.When it came I was so excited. I made plans to roam the streets in my new scooter! I was pretty satisfied for the first few weeks with the scooter's performance, then I got caught up with school work and soon, the scooter was forgotten (obviously the ""newness"" had worn off or possibly it hadn't held my interest, hmm..). I eventually got a very nice bike and rode it every day, especially enjoying making wide turns across the street (which was not the safest choice, you kids out there!).One day, while searching the garage for my bike helmet I stumbled upon an ancient artifact- my old scooter! I decided to test it out and see how well I could still ride it. Of course I had grown some, which was one of the flaws with the scooter... there is a limit to how high the handlebars could be raised.I rode into the driveway and as the first wheel hit the small space between my driveway and the sidewalk- you know... where those little wooden bars are? -the whole scooter tipped over! I thought, either I'm not used to this scooter, or it isn't very stable. So I continued into the road. Expecting to make a large U-turn on the little scooter I turned the handles and quickly the bike stopped and fell over giving me a minor bruise to the forearm.I know, I know- you probably think I'm just some reckless person who was just really stupid with handling my scooter. But I must say, I looked at the scooters handles and thought the two handles where your hands go were pretty close to each other. I compared them to my bike's handles and was surprized. The scooter's handles were really close to each other. Now if you like sensitive steering (tiny movements which turn more than you think), the scooter would be no problem for you. But being a bike rider, I like big wide turns.So here is my list of pros and cons. My opinions may not be even relevantly close to yours, but hey, that's what makes it an opinion.Pros:* These scooters make good birthday presents for kids ( I would recommend ages 6 - 11 but all kids are different)* There are five pretty cool colors: black, blue, purple, red, and green* The handlebars have a squishy feel and are pretty comfortable* The metal bottom part of the scooter where you stand has a rough sand-like texture so you won't slip off while riding* It folds in half for easy transportation as well as the handles folding up* The brake located on the back helps to stop quicklyCons:* The handlebars are somewhat hard to steer* The surface on which you drive needs to be pretty smooth (rough surfaces: hard to maintain speed... cracks or ridges: tipping over)* The handles can't adjust to every height, so if you are at least 5 feet tall, riding MAY become difficult... same with adjusting smaller, the handles might be too high if you aren't particularly tall* It does require a little practice before being able to ride it perfectly... but I suppose that's not really a ""con"", is it?NOTE: If a stick or a rock is in the path of this scooter and you don't want to bother going around it... let me save you the trouble by saying, just go around it!This scooter can be fun to ride as long as it suits you...I'm not really against, or for this scooter. And I am not trying to make you buy, or not buy this product. I just want you to think through the pros and cons before you buy this... unlike I once did."

497421,2,"Underwear is supposed to be comfortable. But this pair is not. First, it doesn't have flat seams. An el cheapo Fruit of the Loom has flat seems that do not chafe. Why make the seams all rough and raised when there is technology to make it flat or simply use bigger piece fabric to lessen the number of seams? Second, the nylon fabric, which everyone is enamored with is, well, still nylon. It doesn't absorb. Underwear is designed to absorb, shall we say, ""post drip"" when there has not been enough ""shaking"" at the end of the urinal movement. In fact, unless you get that perfect amount of shake after the errr, ""movement"", you are bound to have perhaps 1 or 2 drip which should be absorbed by your underpants. That's why we wear underwear. In fact, this garment is so busy expelling any and all moisture that it doesn't protect you from possible accidents showing up on your pants (as if you needed Depends on something).I see that it washes out easy and dries quickly too. But any old nylon gym shorts that created huge amount of electricity on a dry cold day did the same thing back in high school."
96664,0,"A friend of mine bought this model for me from her neighbor for a hundred bucks - the neighbor had it sitting around unused for 2 years. This piece of equipment seemed to be a step up from the eliptical machine I had previously (200 dollar no frills orbitrek I had for 4+ years until the foot pedal bent at an awkward angle and a handle bar broke completely off). My first time on this machine was nice - smooth, quiet, natural range of leg motion, and I like huge foot petals. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of arm/upper body range of motion though. The next couple times seemed to loosen something because it squeaks and squawks and there is a suspicious ""thunk"" sound coming from one of the foot pedals. I'm not huge (150 lbs) and I'm not aggressive on this machine, so I'm inclined to think this elliptical trainer is not meant for everyday use or to only be used by folks under 100 lbs. I'm optimistic that a few turns of a couple screws will silence the squeaks, but considering what I've read about this machine here.....Update - August 19th 2007: It's a bit frightening how much this machine has deteriorated over the past few months. Luckily I can still use it, but the console won't shut off (I have to remove the batteries after each use), the machine still squeaks regardless of tightening/loosening bolts, and the entire machine wobbles. My workout will not progress due to the fact that I'm afraid of breaking the dang thing. I wish I could reduce the # of stars I gave it."

37391,2,"The Good:It has a mirror and a flashlight. I particularly like the flashlight.It has handy gadgets such as tweezers (splinters), compartments (for Advil), and scissors.The Bad:It is fragile! I used the Miss Army Kit as a key chain and dropped it. The mirror popped off. It was a 2-foot-drop not the Sears tower!My car key (the only key I used for the kit) broke off the ring all the time.The pen slipped out of the compartment and gone forever. The company doesn't offer replacement tools.Conclusion:Cute idea, but you are better off buying a Swiss Army Knife (which I did). No mirror though."

374044,1,"I am not into Airsoft, I just live in town and wanted to be able to shoot a target in the yard on the weekends. This fits that bill perfectly. It isn't extremely accurate, I could see the pellets that came with it shooting higher then I was aiming, but I was able to figure out how low to aim to hit the target, and then it was pretty consistent. It came with .12 pellets, I have read the .2 was more accurate and that is what the instructions recommended.It appears to be a pretty solid build, the body and barrel very sturdy. The stock appears a bit weak, but barring physical abuse should suffice.The only design feature I don't like is to take the battery out, you have to remove the handguard, which in itself isn't a problem, but if you have the tactical light attached to the side, you have to remove it first before the handguard will come off. I am not using the light, but if you are planning to use the light, you could be better served by mounting the light on the botton instead of the side."
329761,1,"Arguments rage over ""usability"" of dagger vs bowie etc but if you want a stabbing first /cutting 2nd tool, this is it. whole package is super light and perhaps not as durable as others. tip is fragil on all daggers - some say edge needs work from factory, mine was OK. Warning: TiNi is hard but does scratch, harder to sharpen, but if intact will resist rust better than bead coated in salt water. I like this length better than Daggert 2 as it carries inverted, lighter- easier to get at, less sword like. At $100.00, you can beat this knife up for years and not feel to bad about busting it. in the right hands, this is the finest, highest quality/$$, light, +51/2"" blade, ""usable"" tool and lethal dagger on the market today."
260745,1,this is an excellent cost effective option for a beginner. The color and grip wrap gives it a very high end feel while not hurting the budget. Bought this for my son to use in his class and can't wait to see him use it. Shipping was crazy fast. Don't think you can go wrong with this one. Only down side were a few flaws in the shaping where someone may have gone a wee bit too far in the sanding/shaping process. Of course it's only for training and display and the other aspects more than make up for that.

285616,2,"Bought an automatic Invicta pro-diver from Shop NBC and it arrived with the Crown broken. I sent it back and got a refund. I then decided to give Invicta another shot. I purchased this watch and it looks very nice. The band is a bit noisy and the clasp is very cheap. It gains a few minutes a day for some reason, this happens even if I take it off for a 12 hour plus period of time. I searched the web for tools for sizing of the band and decided to make my own from an old mini- screwdriver, a grinder and a vise. It was suposed to have the Invicta polishing cloth in the package, it did not. As far as the watch being a great value, I don't really think so. I think they are mass produced junk. People compare them to Rolex and Tag all of the time. Well, I own both of these watches, and let me tell you.......it is nothing.....and I mean nothing like either a Tag or a Rolex. Save your money, get a real watch.Bill Wild Willy)12-17-09-UpdateWatch is still working, and gaining time each day. The band/clasp that rests on my desk at work is very scratched and starting to look like an old watch. The front and the crystal are like new. Must be a very low grade stainless used on the band, but, I suppose I knew that based on the sound it makes.01-7-10 - Watch is working great, I like it more the more I wear it. It may gain time, but my Rolex loses time at about the same rate, which drives me nuts. It has turend out to be a pretty rugged watch..... I am changing my views on Invicta.10-3-11-UpdateI have encountered a new problem this past year. The watch pins keep breaking and the watch keeps falling off. Each time I go to the jewler store and get new ones only to las a few days. I need to find some heavy duty pins, watch is too heavy for the pins it came with origionally. And all the new ones I get are even worse. Watch still gains a couple of min a day time which I dial back. No scratches on crystal yet, pretty durable. You get what you pay for."

145528,1,"Alright I would like to start off by saying that the locking mechanism is fantastic, the same idea behind all the U-Locks, so they don't really get credit for something new and inventive, just being able to do something properly. That cool looking black and silver cover over the actual lock however could be made with more durable plastic... I dropped the damn thing once from the height of a normal 19"" cross tube and the plastic shattered... Lock still functions perfectly fine, but I was annoyed that it didn't look so pretty anymore."

366345,0,"This tent has a lot of space and room inside, even with the divider wall put up. An average size person can stand up inside. This is good for when you change your clothes. I like the opposite two door feature. The sky-light in the rain-fly is okay, but is is not very clear for viewing the night time sky.The divider wall is removable (as opposed to other tents that only roll up), and with the wall in place you can have two separate sleeping rooms, or a sleeping room and a sitting area. With the wall down, a queen-size mattress looks small, so there is plenty of room for a king. Be careful if you plan on putting camp chairs or table inside - you will risk ripping the floor unless you put a mat under them.The awning that is included is pretty much worthless. A decent breeze can cause it to collapse rather easily with only one guy line on each pole, but it did a bit better with two guy lines on each. If it starts to rain, FORGET IT; take it down immediately. The attachment of awning causes water to pool up on the rain-fly and on the awning itself. Zipping the corners of the rain-fly does not help since their is no way to secure the rain-fly over the center pole with the awning attached. The instructions say to lower one of the awning poles in the rain, but this does not help to allow the water to run off the rain-fly.In the rain you need to guy-line the rain-fly, otherwise water will run off on the windows and find its way inside the tent. This works out okay, but the guy-lines are brown and hard to see so they become a potential tripping hazard.Purchase a good set of stakes before you put up the tent. The ""stakes"" that are included are a joke - they are 1/8-in diameter pins that have little, if any, holding power.All the zippers on the tent are plastic. This is probably to keep the tent light-weight, but this is not a tent to be hauled around much. Metal zippers would be much better and eliminate the weak-point that basically renders most tents unusable.I was disappointed with the floor. It is very thin, and is the same material that is used on the walls. I bought the 3x tent pad to put beneath it, but a 10-mill tarp would work better.Overall, I was much happier with my Eureka Sunrise 11 that has proven to be durable and reliable. It has seen many a camping trip and apart from bent poles and worn-out plastic zippers is still in good shape. If it was not for the worn zippers coming apart, I would still be using it. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the Copper Canyon 1312 may last as long."
338512,2,Bought this product for my brother for his birthday. He walks everyday and notices it doesn't measure the steps accurately. Another setback is it is tough to reset the pedometer so it resets at the end of the day. Not easy to use at least not for me.9

After donig my own research it sounded like the right set.Like others have said, the arrows are not of high quality. Our interest was more in the Bow. My son had learned archery at summer camp and was pretty good at it. The one concern I had was about the 25 lb draw. After reading several reviews and other research I decided this was a good purchase (my son bought with his own money).The draw seems a bit high in terms of resistance and is not adjustable. Some research said to be careful about resistance for kids because of risk as their muscles and joints are growing.The build quality seems good and would be fine for an older child or adult. For our situation the resistance reduces the fun and poses health concerns so we will be getting a bow with lower resistance.The rating has nothing to do with quality, it is for the fit to our need."

I have not yet used it for 100 hours so I can't attest to that but assuming it's true, I would be very happy. It has two modes, flashing and constant.

417597,1,"We bought this for our 18 month son. We were hoping that he would be able to begin learning how to use the pedals for cycling, but he can only barely reach them if he scoots forward of the seat. That said, he really wants to use them and is happy for now to just push with his feet. He's too tall now for ride-on toys, so this works well for that. We bought it for its versatility as a rocker and trike, but my son is frustrated with it in the rocker mode because it does not really rock back and forth as dramatically as most rockers he's been on, so it mostly stays as a tricycle. Our son's legs are long enough that he can put them on the rocker platform, so we have no problems with the foot pegs that other people cite. We just click the foot pegs out of the way in their little holders. I think this will, in a couple of months, be a wonderful trike for him to learn how to pedal with. The price is really good and the trike is well-constructed, for plastic. I was against buying a plastic tricycle, but then I remembered back to what my favorite toy was when I was growing up . . . my Big Wheel! I'm giving in to the plastic! Enjoy, it's worth the purchase!"
337338,1,I think the pedometer is really wonderful and light weight. It even stays put after running 6 miles!

OUr daughter has always had a rather ""large"" head, so we were surprised that this helmet wobbles all over the place, no matter how we adjust the straps. It constantly falls over her eyes or to the back of her head. I can't imagine this is keeping her head very safe if she were to fall. It aggravates her and she wants to take it off a lot. I think there should be adjustable straps inside this helmet like there are inside the toddler helmet of the same design."

Airport security had me open the case when I checked in and I left it unlocked - when I arrived at my destination, security hand delivered the case to me with my X7 inside - the case protected my marker and there was no problems. Only wish there was more room inside for paintball gear, but it was designed for transporting rifles and not paintball markers and gear. Good case - very well cushioned and protective for the price."
266251,0,"The PT Cruiser was average at best. Somewhat dissopointed in the overall quality of the product. The wheels are out of allignment and rub on the very cheap fender guards. I expected more, there are better quality cruisers out there for the money."
77121,0,"These numbers aren't really for any sport where the athletes will get sweaty or wet. They are not durable at all! We used them for a run and by the time the runners crossed the line, almost everyone's number deteriorated. The only ones that held were those who laminated their numbers the day prior."
74938,2,"Just what I was looking for. After researching many tents I came across this one. It had many cool features and it was backed by Coleman's WeartherTec System(tm) ""Guaranteed to keep you dry"". I was impressed by their online claims that all tents were tested in a Rain Room and also in a Wind Room. The special features also included special ""leak-free"" seems to protect you from the elements. The tent worked great in dry weather. The first night it rained it leaked at virtually every seem. Even the door leaked at its' seems. With sleeping bags and pillows drenched we had to sleep in the car. We knew for sure the floor of the tent was water proof since we discovered in the morning that a small pool had accumulated inside. I had to drive 45 min. out to buy tarps. I really liked the tent, I just wish it where water proof."
192700,1,I'm on my feet all day wearing boots and walking on concrete or tile. The hiker socks were like wearing a thick cushion all around my feet. Very comfortable! I like all the Wigwam socks so far.
17217,2,I received my supporters yesterday. To my surprise they were NOT the brand as advertised here. They came as the RAWLINGS brand instead. I was told it was an error and more or less told to just suck it up. Buyer beware here. Obviously I won't be doing business with this seller again.
109155,0,It was first compression T-Shirt and was unsure what to exspect. Should have gotton the bigger size
196004,0,"This light is fine, but heavy. When you hang it in the tent, it weighs it down. If it were to rain, you would probably have a leak. We actually use it in our camping kitchen and our camping grill. I can't recommend you use it with a grill because it isn't designed for that kind of heat- so be careful. But it's great with the camping kitchen!"
308979,0,"I like discraft, but this putter is okay at best. The material of the Soft APX warps VERY easy and loses shape. Mine looks like I'm throwing a floppy pancake. It's only purpose now is a marker. It's feel was good when dry, and it was fairly accurate at about up to 30ft, but was terrible if wet.Overall not terrible, the durability was okay...but take it out on a hot day and you may as well throw it in the trash. It'll warp and never go back."
301101,1,"This product is excellent for use trolling fishing, but for baitcasting, spinning or surf-fishing is a problem because you need only a small litter for tangling and knots formed are very complicated."
353836,0,I gave this product a three because of the materials. This screen tent is made of fairly cheap materials. It would not stand up to any severe weather. Also I think the zippers on the doors will end up ripping after a few uses. the first time using it was on a camping trip and we ended up with severe rain the first night. Of course it was not meant to be waterproof so everything inside got wet but that was to be expected.The good points to it are the ease of setting it up and it's size. It took me and my wife less than 15 minutes to get it set up.If you buy this for shade and to keep the bugs out and you use it in normal weather it will work OK for you. But this is definitely not something you will be able to set up and leave it up all summer.
167472,1,"Before I begin, let me say I am in no way affiliated with Grand Trunk. I have tried out many hammocks both costly and cheap in my quest for the best one in relation to camping, these include DD Frontline Hammock (which I own), EMO, textsport and others. This has been my best hammock so far.This hammock is as comfortable as many of the expensive ones (as long as you aren't too tall, I am 6'1"" and its fine), and yet it is also the lightest I've found comprehensively browsing all which exist out there (with the exception of the nano from grand trunk as well... if you're willing to pay 3 times the price). I used it on a month long biking tour through France and England, and it held up great. It was always the thing to look forward too at night. I would rather sleep in this in the woods then have someone kindly invite us over for the night; cause with this I would get a good night's sleep.There just isn't any price/weight/comfort ratio to match this bargain out on the market! No other hammock out there is this cheap AND weighs so little. And its comfortable. My roomate traded his more expensive one for one of these. I now have two (I wanted green). If something ever happens to one, I'm getting another!"
374734,2,"Many of my law enforcement friends have depts that use 5.11 but I've found they're more marketing than superior quality. You can get the same items cheaper from places like Propper or Charles River. Frankly, agencies that use 5.11 are wasting tax payer money on items they could get at much better prices."

440522,0,"These pants have a very wide elastic waist, but the pants are so wide that on a very thin girl, the effect is almost comical. I should add that my daughter is just shy of 10 years old, average height and on the thin side, and the size 1 fits her well lengthwise, but, as mentioned, the pants are really baggy. So, these might be great for a brawnier child.The weight of the fabric is as expected, not light, but not a super heavyweight pant either. Quality seems good. No apparent shrinkage, but I do not put them in a dryer."

96829,2,"I got this machine for my birthday. During my first use, I noticed that the resistance was not working. I reported it to ProForm. They sent someone out to repair it in a little over a week. When the repair guy came out, he took it apart but could not fix it! He left it in 20 pieces in the middle of the room and left. After 2 weeks of trying to get a hold of ProForm, they informed me that it would be cheaper to replace than repair. They demanded a receipt. But it was a gift and I don't have a receipt... so now... 3 months later... it is still sitting in pieces in the middle of the room. We have spent over 40 hours over the phone with them. Lately, they don't even answer the phone anymore.When we did finally get a hold of someone, they told us that they now want $150 to repair/replace it!!Buyers beware!!!"
353624,0,"I was up in the air about getting this game on the Wii version after bad reviews. I decided to rent the games first and try it out before dishing out $30. I must say that it's not all that bad. I played a few games and won all but one. The hardest part was trying to figure out the moves to make on the controller. I would of likes to see an option where you can go, to familiarize yourself with the moves instead of just instruction. If you have the Bigs on the Wii system you know what I am talking about. The slam dunk contest is a but challenging since you have to be quick about your hand movement to ensure that 10 scoring dunk. The three point shoot out is great, which was easy for me to knock down the whole rack and win. There should of been more challenges to complete where you can unlock. Overall I am going to buy the actual game."
402778,1,Had this thing forever now the review just came up been years I still have it washed a bunch of times ran in it etc.. still holding up well made

31228,1,"My family loves this blanket. We keep it in the car for impromptu picnics or for relaxing on a lawn. We just took it to the beach and it was great there too. This is the perfect blanket for picnics, outdoor concerts, beach trips. We have not had trouble with waterproofing and I know that I have used it before on wet grass. We also have not had problems with chemical smells. I plan to but one for each of the members of our family this Christmas."
11278,0,I had a vest like this one from about 5 years ago but it wore out and I wanted to get a replacement. I got it and it is as warm as the last one but the material seems a bit thin. Not sure how long it is going to last but 5 years would really surprise me.
185382,0,The item is bigger than its look. So they are quite heavy. Combined they weight over 1 lb. The lock itself weights 6 oz. The dial works but it is sort of cumbersome and takes a while to master. The wire coils naturally so it is good for hanging on bike. I suggest keeping the wire but replace the lock with one that won't make you sweat at night in a dark corner.

336863,0,"Via Amazon, I ordered the $12.95 chair from Sportsman's Guide--Sage Green and Black. The picture posted on Amazon is not accurate. What I received is a different color scheme, and does not include the velcro straps to hold the chair closed.Note that what you'll get is Crazy Creek's Causal Line chair, which is a step down from their Adventure Line chair. It has less padding, appears to be less waterproof, and as previously noted, does not have velcro closing straps. (See Crazy Creek's website for clarification on the differences in the two).That said, it is lightweight and seems decently constructed. You should just know that if you're looking for the traditional original Crazy Creek Chair, this is not it.Amazon needs to be more accurate with its images and descriptions."
120468,0,"These lugs crimp okay but no better than others and are not 100%. I had to crimp using the proper tool several times on one of the lugs out of four in order to get it to hold sufficiently.

160808,0,"I got this watch the first time from a warehouse store. I broke the band in a snowboarding incident and had it repaired. I then broke the crystal and went out and bought a second one. I love this watch, but both of them had the same issues:On both watches, purchased 2 years apart, I had these exact same issues:The spring winds out within 12-14 hours.If the spring winds out, I have to shake and shake the watch to get it revved back up.Regular use will not catch this watch up if it has wound all the way down. (for me anyways)When this happens, it runs very erratically until it stays wound for a couple of days.I end up wearing this watch much more than I want in order to keep it wound and avoid this inconsistency issue.I love every other aspect of this watch.But the fact that I have to wear it more than I want, or suffer a day or 2 of very erratic time keeping, knocks 2 stars off my review.When I have to get another watch, it won't be this one. I won't go through this again."
148845,0,This was purchased as a gift. The receiver has complained about hanging the hoop on the door. She wishes that it could be hung on the wall.

448542,0,FOR THE MONEY THAT I PAID I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A REAL HEAVYWEIGHT TYPE OF FLEECE SWEATSHIRT. IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO GET IT AND ACTUALLY SEE THE MATERIAL IT WAS MADE OF. IT IS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND MORE LIKE A HEAVY GAUGE T-SHIRT. THE EMBROIDERED DESIGN ON THE FRONT IS THE ONLY BONUS. THE SIZING IS GOOD.
374604,1,"They are nice gloves. They are serving the purpose for which they were bought. Only thing is they take bulky D batteries, which isn't so bad but they don't last very long and batteries are expensive!!"
240227,1,My husband has told me about 50 times how much he likes these shirts. They fit perfectly and the feel is very rich. He loves them.
464586,2,"I was under the impression that these were yogitoes hbands, but once I got them, they say ""Absolute"" on the tag of the headband. It's rather deceiving because on the invoice, it mentions the vendor is an authorized seller of yogitoes and manduka. I hope the quality is just as good, but I can't say I'm a fan of the slide of hand. It is too good of a deal to be true. They don't include a phone number to reach them at either- just an e-mail address, which I probably get a response from. Not cool, Absolute Yogi. Not. Cool."
297895,0,"I am a little disappointed in this purchase. In the photo, they look like they are solid, black leggings, but upon opening the box, they are waffle-like patterned, identical to long underwear. I understand I purchased them for skiing, but thought based on the other reviews that they would be of a more versatile use (under skirts, to the gym, etc). So, I am giving them a 3 star review because it is highly unlikely that I will ever wear these pants unless they are for the pure purpose of warmth, i.e. while tail-gaiting at a football game, I will wear them under jeans, when I ski, etc. I am curious as to why no one else commented on this fact?"
486014,1,Not difficult to install (read other recommendations for tips) and provides a far more challenging workout.
144843,0,"It was easy to put together and only needed minimal adjustment. I think it took about 30 - 40 minutes tops. I switched from a mountain bike so I was familiar with riding. I like the lightness and the gearing. The brakes are mounted a little awkwardly. I am thinking about changing that so i can brake from a seated upright position. Otherwise, a great bike for the price."
155038,0,Good product but not as good as rival Propper. 5.11 has couple unique pockets but Propper still a better buy stain resistance coating and match belt
249516,0,"This is much smaller than I expected. It runs on those little candleabra lights which aren't bright enough to serve as room light.The plus side is that it looks GREAT and it's heavy so when my cats run into it they don't knock it over, breaking it (which also allows me to not kill my cats, so that's a good thing). The quality seems very good as well.So buy it if you're looking for a small lamp for an end table, or just want to show off your favorite team in a cool way, but if you're looking for something that will light up the room? Get something else."
364564,0,"When I ordered this I didn't realize it was not a standard size softball... it's actually SUPER HUGE! Do people really use this size softball?! If so, how?! lol... way to big to even hold, never mind catch, it wouldn't fit in my daughter's glove. We did have a good laugh though... and the return process was easy and courteous @ eSportsonline. Bottom line, beware in ordering these unless you have big hands. :)"
171292,1,"Pros : Windproof, Warm, Comfortable, Ear Covering, Durable, QuietCons : Hot Ears, Noise MufflingBest Uses : Cold Loud Climbing Huts, Very Windy Weather, Very cold weatherThis hat is insanely warm. I've found I can only really use it in very cold temperatures or very windy temperatures, maybe around 15 degrees F or below.I may be weird, but my ears don't like to be covered up unless the weather is really intense. I always end up flipping the earflaps up, making me feel like Robin Hood... Which could really be a pro or a con depending on the situation (it's a pretty big con if you happen to be dealing with the Sheriff of Nottingham).That being said, this hat is one of the warmest I've ever worn and if you have trouble keeping your head warm then look no further. It's also great if you need a bit of sound muffling in a cold crowded climbing hut. My hearing drops about 25% with the ear flaps down, they kind of make me feel like I'm wearing headphones.I need to declare that I am a member of the Gore Mountaintechs product testing community, therefore I sometimes have the privilege of testing and reviewing sweet swag from W.L. Gore and Associates. Regardless, my words stand for this hat, I have a pretty deep love/hate relationship with it, love shines through most often though."
196152,1,Product came on time as told box it came in was a little small so they had to fold down the top of the hat to fit it in somewhat effecting the shape. Also the the hat doesn't have that New Era stitching that is usually on the left side of New EraHats the hat which makes my question its a authenticity. but i cant complain because it is not shown in the picture
489544,0,"Feels kind of cheap and flimsy when open. The plastic twists a bit around the hinges. I guess you get what you pay for. It's certainly very low cost. I want something with a more solid feel to it, however."
402620,2,"We bought two chairs and were so disappointed. When we first got them, one chair arrived with a broken backpack clasp and had to be returned. Then the replacement chair had a problem with mismatched reclining slots on the arms, at which point we decided to go ahead and return both chairs for a refund. They were very heavy to carry as backpack chairs for any length of time, and they were not as ""all day"" comfortable as we expected them to be when we took them to an all-day music festival. Also, the footstool is advertised as being able to fold upward and serve as a table, but it works awkwardly at best because it wobbles instead of anchoring into a firm position. All in all, not worth the money."
1247,0,"I'm an average height woman, medium boned, slightly overweight but not obese. I could get these on my wrists, but it took some effort. I took them off after 5 minutes. They are the right weight and I can use them, but I think they would have been better if there was some way to make them open up. Velcro, snaps, or just some elastic would have made these worth 4 or 5 stars. As it is, they won't work very well for adults, especially larger adults."
381282,1,"Delivered quickly, works as advertised. It is nice to be able to download the info to my PC. Very accurate. Well worth the price."
431154,1,"I bought a B-67 at the beginning of last season, and put it on my Cinelli Supercorsa. For the uninitiated, the Cinelli is a thoroughbred racing bike, mine is a very old one from late 1950's or very early '60's. The seat hurt me for many miles, and the springs messed with my ability to pedal hard. As soon as I started pouring on the power, the springs would start bouncing and kill any rhythm I had in my pedaling. The seat was also a very hard surface, and felt like I was riding on a piece of slate. If you do any serious road riding, this seat is not for you. *BUT*After I removed it from the racing bike, I went to Ace Hardware and bought a bottle of neatsfoot oil. I put the saddle in a freezer (ziplock) baggie, and poured the whole bottle of oil in the bag- then let it soak overnight. The next day I put the remainder of the oil back in the bottle, and dried off the seat as best as I could, then let it soak up the sun for a few days. I then mounted it on a cruiser style bike, dressed the top surface with Brooks Proofide, and buffed the top with a soft horsehair brush, followed by a terrycloth towel. I fell in love with the seat within the first 50 miles. It is spectacular on the cruiser style bike. I rode it for the rest of last season (daily), and still ride it every day. I just had to stretch it (adjust the nose bolt) last week, as it has finally softened and stretched to a point where it was starting to have too much give for my tastes. It has conformed to my backside, and is like riding on a horse saddle that has been worn in over many years. Still looks fantastic (although darker since I gave it the big oil treatment). My only caution if you choose to use this method is that you will need to wear black bike shorts when you ride the seat, or chance getting residual oil stains on the seat of your pants. When you get to be my age, oil stains on the seat of the pants are highly suspicious, and to be avoided. ;)All in all, the oil has now stopped marking my jeans and the seat feels like heaven. This was not my first leather saddle, but it was the first one I bought brand new. Construction is great, materials are great, but it needs to be on a bike that is ridden upright position. Highly recommended. My oldest son has been trying different saddles for his comfort bike (he rides a Brooks B-17 Imperial on his 1964 Schwinn Paramount), and has decided to go with a B-67 after having tried mine a few times."
423849,2,"Though inexpensive and cleverly designed, this hanger does not deserve the name ""universal."" I bought it to hang a sword that has protuberances at the end of the hilt (the butt?) that stand out 90 degrees from the plane of the blade. These protuberances caused the sword not to hang flat to the wall and, worse, kept the holder from locking properly. I ended up using an eye screw and wire instead of a special hanger.Truth in advertising would require a note that this hanger will work only with FLAT swords."

171910,0,"I own several knives (CRKT, Kershaw, Benchmade, Kabar, SOG, Gerber) and have purchased about 6 of them on Amazon. This is the first one I have felt the need to review.PROS:- Overall AMAZING feel! The construction of the knife just feels quality.- Texture on the handle makes for a solid FIRM grip .. love it!- Opening, closing, and locking is solid as well.CONS:- Poor blade quality; bent, broken, and dull after less than 2 months of general use.Despite all the good things about this knife, I only gave it 3 stars because of the shortcomings with the most important part...the blade!First, I use my folders as everyday carry, general purpose knives. They used to cut the occasional rope, open boxes, slice fruit, etc ... not heavy duty by any means. When the knife first arrived, it was as sharp as can be but now it is fairly dull. The blade is now bent and the tip broken after general use.BOTTOM LINE: I like this knife SO much but the truth is I've gotten better performance from my CRKT M16 series knives, some of which can be purchased at half the price of this Kershaw."
58975,1,"I highly recommend this Oakley D1 watch. I bought it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. It has super nice quality and looks very very sporty. Best of all, it's OAKLEY merchandise.

160208,0,"I followed other reviewers comments about size. I am normally a womens sz 7 and ordered a 5 and they fit fine. However, when you try to ""move"" the wheel with your finger it does not move freely, it stays put. I am a mom that loves to skate with her kiddos and have since I was young, so not a pro-skater, but not inexperienced either. I still prefer my 17 year old skates to these, as they freely turn when prompted and would roll down the driveway if I put them at the top (on incline). This pair would not go anywhere."

346946,1,"We got one of these for each family member back in 2007 in preparation and in anticipation of a swimming/diving/snorkeling vacation and they didn't disappoint. What we got was basic but reliable snorkeling gear that met our expectations - we were careful to order the right size and we weren't disappointed. By the way, if you go to the U.S. Divers site, there are lots of tips on snorkeling and picking the right equipment.To answer the 'how good are they?' question - my kids just love them and we've been using them ever since. As far as the components are concerned:- The snorkel seems quite 'dry' to me - I don't remember much water draining into my mouth - but anyone who needs a drier version, snorkels are quite interchangeable. Drier snorkels are available from U.S. Divers and others but, they cost a little more.- The mask fits well and it's easy to adjust. You shouldn't get much water under the mask and it should be a comfortable wear for as long as you follow the rules.- Fins are well designed and comfortable to wear if you pick the right size - get it a little larger, just in case. They can be used on bare feet and, with 4 users in my family, there were no reports of blisters. Over 3 seasons only one cracked and had to be discarded and the kids subject them to pretty rough treatment including almost daily use in the summer, in the pool and sharing them with visiting friends.For this price, this set is a good buy. Maybe it's not perfect but, as almost always, you tend to get what you are paying for and in this case I believe that you are getting your money's worth.P.S. - At the time we bought the 4 snorkeling sets we also ordered theU.S. Divers Mariner Diving Gear Bagto carry them around. We still have it, we're using it at least twice a week to carry things around and, after all these years, it's as good as new.P.P.S. - I do NOT work for U.S. Divers, I just happen to enjoy some of the stuff they make because it's good quality and fit for its purpose."

97585,0,"I am very happy with this watch in general. It's very easy to use and understand and I love having all the common information available at once. However, the biggest downside to this watch is the temperature gauge. I thought for sure that when you bought the watch it would have a sensor in it that you adjusted on the basis of your own body heat. That way, for example, if the ""real"" temperature was 80 degrees, but your watch showed that it was 90 degrees when you were wearing the watch, you could adjust the temperature gauge of the watch by -10 degrees to set off the difference. But this isn't true. So, the temperature gauge is a total gimmick. It will never read the actual ambient temperature as it's picking up your own body heat all the time making the reading completely inaccurate. Cool idea, bad execution. So if you want to know the temperature using this watch, take the watch off your arm, wait 20 minutes and let it climatize to the surrounding area, read the temperature, (which seems correct at this point) and then put it back on your arm. Repeat as necessary. If you don't have 20 minutes to spare each time buy a thermometer."
431576,0,"Ok, first off it only works with on original gas tube. Next,if i had known i would not have ordered it.I am currently using Tapcos gas tube its bigger than the original.(SKS YUGO 59/66) Now after saying that i did go and swap out the wood for steel.It looks great, but not the best fit. It will move if bumped but that is not a big deal. I was going to use the steel hand guard under the UTG SOCOM TRI RAIL hand guard for looks. So for me to stay in compliance on this build i am forced to use tapcos gas tube."
107332,0,"I like the shape of this ergonomic body ball and it is a good second body ball to a truly spherical one I already own. It does have a slight hourglass shape to conform to your body, which isn't apparent in the picture.The downside is the construction and materials used to make this body ball. Unlike most body balls I have encountered or owned which have a roughened non-slip surface, this is a smoother material not unlike industrial dishwashing gloves or a rubber balloon. It still isn't slippery, but it is a bit different. Secondarily, the unit I received isn't evenly molded -- even when fully inflated it still has a few bumps and creases from the vinyl material being unevenly thick and thin in certain places. This is very evident when holding it up to the light, as I can see shadows and light spots from the uneven thickness of the material. I'm unsure if this will affect the longevity and durability of the ball.The nozzle of the pump was also broken when I received it. Regardless, the pump was very difficult to use and very slow. I ended up using the pump from my Valeo body ball to inflate this body ball.On a much less important note, the ball is what I would refer to as a hospital pale blue, a bit lighter than than what's pictured here. I'm not too much of a fashionista when it comes to color of equipment, but I can't help think of being in the hospital when using this ball."

I don't think anyone cares about the stuff between surfing and what ""you"" are really thinking.....lack of surfing and energy. I would not suggest this video, you have better things to do with yourself. Do a load of laundry instead and take a nap....what a waste of time!Not trying to be negative, but this video isn't cheap and it sucks balls."
108101,1,"I bought this item 4 weeks ago for my 11 year old, and he loves it, all his friends ride it ranging from 80lbs to 125lbs and they get good speed out of it. rated at 12 mph and it seems to do that. I rode it 210lbs, and it's slower but still no problem.it looks really small when you get it out of the box, but once you put your feet on the front rail, it's not that small. Its very low to the ground, so you have to have the flag on. but you can't turn it over, so much safer than the ATV's. i bought a second one for our 6 year old last week, and it works great again."
428302,0,"Compared to the Swiss Army SwissTool, which I also own, this tool has many drawbacks: It needs oil. The pliers have a lot of friction even when oiled -- they don't swing open easily, I need to use two hands to pull them apart after each motion. The scissors are really tiny, almost bizarrely so. It's kind of ugly. No ruler, even though there's space for one. The can opener doesn't retract well, so it exposes you to a sharp edge whenever you are using the pliers -- a really poor bit of design.There are some real positives too. The tools are the right size, and the screwdrivers seem exceptionally solid. The half-serrated blade is a feature some people will like, and it's fairly (not exceptionally) sharp. The non-glare matte finish may please some people, and makes the tool easy to hold firmly. The plier tips are strong and precisely machined, suitable for both fine and medium-sized work.If the price is low (I paid twenty), it's a decent purchase. But it's certainly NOT the best multi-tool available."

271598,2,"After being cycled through my gun twice, already leaving flakes of aluminum inside the gun. I bought some for my 9mm as well as .40 S&W, both sets did the same thing.

492773,0,"Product is exactly as advertised, and just about what i had expected, however i failed to notice the disclaimer saying that the chain and charm (the one at the end of the hilt) weren't included. Sadly that (to me at least) was a large part of why i liked the sword. Anyways, it's otherwise a pretty alright replica."

336707,0,I bought this for my 7 year olds Cascade CS. It fits as promised covers about 85% of the face mask. I had just a minor issue with attaching the mouth piece after I put on the Face Shield. It's made of a very very thin plastic which reminds me of the plastic that a GI Joe action figure comes in. I was expecting something like the Under Armour Football Face Shield but that it literally 50x thicker than this. I guess they have to make it thin to fit multiple different brands. Finger prints and smudge marks from sweat very easy but that is expected all face shields I've used do this. Attaches with provided Velcro straps which is nice for easy removal and it's soft so you don't have to deal with zip ties.My sons review after one game:All the guys on my team loved my mask dad!I loved playing with it dad it didn't bother me at all...Overall for $20 I'll probably buy the smoke one also for sunny days I'm just worried my son's league won't allow it b/c of head injury cautions and concussions so they can see the players eyes.

376557,1,"This wrench, like other Park tools, is well made to work well and last a long time. Because it is more expensive, a full set is prohibitively expensive for some, but since these are sold individually, even commoners like me can afford the one or two I need for my bikes. If you want high quality tools, this is a great investment to do the minor repairs and upgrades that some of us enjoy. Highly recommended."
17641,0,"The size of the bench is nice for women. The cable does not work smoothly. When you try to use it it is very jerky. I find the cable completely useless. Like others have written, it came without the instructions. I had to call the company and they emailed them to me. I really wanted something with working cables but too much trouble to take apart and return."
194421,0,These grips are well made but the velcro straps definitely don't hold as tightly for long. Would definitely recommend their buckle strap version.
181147,2,"This product is poorly made but I guess like the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for"". If you have a toy pistol than this product will be ideal. The flexible hinge doesn't look very durable and probably will fail after time. This is the reason I rated it two stars."
338934,1,"I haven't used a lot of pedometers, but the ones I have were chintzy and could add steps just by shaking it. This pedometer works WAY better.

And I'll probably buy more in the future!!"
457356,1,"I gave up trying to find a watch with both a compass and a thermometer, since none of the temperature watches seemed to work well (according to all the reviews). I then looked at only watches with compasses, plus the usual set of timers and alarms and stuff. The Enduro seemed to be the best combination of cost and value.My first day with it, I was driving in an unfamiliar city at night on a poorly marked road and the compass helped me determine I was going the right direction. (Soon afterwards, I found a route sign.)I have since used it kayaking to orient our group, so that feature seems to work fine.The rest of the features are as easy to use as any watch I have had and I doubt I am using them to their full advantage.Also, it's easy to read and I think it's one of the more stylish of this type of watch.So... I feel like I got more than my money's worth here.Note that I have had the watch for only one month now, so time (sorry) will tell. But, so far so good."
217370,0,"Pros: affordable; soild build; accurate compass; relatively acurate barometer; Good stop watch with splits and data log;Cons: bulky; unreliable altimeter; funny weather prediction function; temperature only works off-wrist(otherwise it's always above 30 dC).Interesting points:1) The altimeter gives estimation based on sea level pressure and on-site pressure, therefore, its absolute altitude estimation is always inaccurate. According to this watch,my sitting room is sometimes ~15 meters under sea water while I live in mountains.2) Although the absolute altitude reading is always way-off the truth, the relative height can be estimated fairly acurate. I've tried to measure some small hills and even some big buildings. The estimates in meters are accurate enough to my needs. I would be happy to use it in outdoor acticities later.3) Except when a strong weather system pass by, most of the time the weather prediction function is associated not only with barometer measurements but also thermometer readings. Unfortunately, the thermoeter can give the right readings only when it's off-wrist for more than 15 minutes."

24749,0,I ordered a 75cm ball but the arrived ball is at most 65cm.I am too lazy complainning or returning so I have to live with it.

We also do free weights on it and other routines.
365004,0,"I'm hard on my knives and I'm readily aware that my review is being placed after much abuse...but I only had this knife for a few months. I appreciate still the quality of Gerber, this however is the first knife from them in 10 years that I was able to break, whereas I stiopped buying Spydercos after three almost immediate deaths.We were doing a tie down on a truck and I had to drop it to catch a sliding crate. My companion came around the corner fast to help and simply stepped on it...hes not horribly heavy nor do I think he came down that hard, but the casing cracked and since it's only held together in a few places by a bolt, it was not repairable. On that note, I love the look and feel of this knife.As a woman, I do have a little sense of style and appreciate clean lines in a knife so I don't look like I'm carrying a 4x4 in my pocket or boot, so I love how slim this one is. I almost bought another, because it worked wonderfully and was very versatile, but I need something that won't snap when stepped on. My search continues."

297488,0,"I was so excited to read this book but very frustrated when I saw the menu. It seems that no one involved with this book thought to put together a shopping list and make sure the meal plan was reasonable for an average person. There are more than sixty ingredients in just the first seven days (many of which require only a small amount of something be used, so hopefully you have a family to eat the rest and/or unlimited freezer space).My frustration is that I will need to simplify this menu for my budget, but Tracy emphasizes it MUST be followed to the letter, no substitutes or repeats. I just can't imagine there wasn't a more reasonable, affordable option for the average person."

508661,0,"Overall, I like the rack but there are a couple of things I do not like. First, like one poster also mentioned, the long straps just dangle in the wind unless you use a rubber band to wrap them up with. I will probably just cut the excess off because the bands will end up breaking.Also, I have a Trek mountain bike and I can only put it on the back (the farthest out) rungs on the rack. If I try to use the others, the pedal hits my car! (yes I tried rotating it, but it definitely hits the car) I do not need to put 3 bikes on the rack, but I definitely wanted to be able to put 2 on it but I can't figure out how this is possible. I have a Corolla so I would have thought this would not be an issue with this car.Other than that, it stays put surprisingly well, and I am fairly content."
416588,0,My son used it in China this past year. Said it wasn't well made and that most other students used REI products. He did not think it was worth the $$ paid.
399619,0,It was one of the cheaper white board out there. The first time I used it with the dry erase pen it comes with the markings did not easily erase. After three or four uses I've had to use marker board cleaner to get the markings to come off. After a week the board looked like I'd had used it for two or three seasons. Not very happy with this purchase.
264295,2,WARNING!!!! PLZ LISTEN.Ok so most of the buyers of this product are going to be dissapointed to hear that this jersey is a replica from china which you can get for 25 dollars with a group order. Dont follow these sellers because THEY ARE!! RIPPING YOU OFF!!. The real stiched jersey does not have poor quality stiching and it is a different color. Not saying that these jerseys are bad but you can get them alot cheaper.
367461,2,"I didn't purchase this but am wondering how this product could be ""non-toxic"" if it is made out of vinyl (PVC)? Vinyl is known for having pthalates, lead, dioxin, chlorine, plasticizers and other chemicals. The vinyl stability ball I recently received as a gift says the chemicals in it are known to cause birth defects and reproductive issues. I am pregnant and definitely don't want to be inhaling these or getting them on my skin; but even if I wasn't, I'd look for other products - maybe those made with rubber instead of vinyl."

36392,1,"Love this dry bag. The price was right and the quality of construction is excellent. It's perfect for taking on my kayak and just enough space to hold my wallet, cell phone, keys, and small towel. I also like the D-ring which allows for a convenient attachment of a lanyard."

163472,0,"I wanted a lock that I could put on my bike without it looking massive or detracting from the look of the bike too much. This lock is very compact in size. I've been using it for about 2 months now. My experience has been that this is a good lock to use if all you're trying to accomplish is deterring an opportunistic thief who doesn't want to put a lot of effort in to steal a bike. However, in most cases this U-lock is too small to lock both the front tire and frame to a rack, so you'll probably just end up locking the frame to the rack, leaving your front tire vulnerable unless you use an additional cable. I don't have a quick release front tire, nor do I have an expensive bike, so for me, this lock is almost perfect as is.I say ""almost perfect"" because the standard black and orange color can be awful if aesthetics are at all a concern to you like they were for me. Again, I wanted something small and compact that would not detract from the look of my bike. This fit the small and compact category, but the color was a problem. I ordered the Kryptonite U-lock Skin (also from Amazon) and changed the color of this lock to mostly white, with a bit of black. It looks so much better. I also wrote a review for the U-lock Skin product describing how easy/challenging it was to get on - if you're interested."
196721,2,"Yes, the brace offers very good protection for the knee--as long as your leg is pretty straight. But if you're doing brazilian jiujitsu where you're on your knees a lot, the knees bent, they just aren't any good.First of all, the brace puts a lot of pressure on a bent knee--the internal support ""pushes back"" a lot when bent.Then, after using these for a few weeks for jiujitsu, one of them actually split in the back.Another issue I found for jiujitsu is that the brace kept falling off. So on the one hand it was too tight for a bent knee, and on the other, it kept slipping off. I did try a size larger and those came off even quicker.So I have to assume these are more for stand-up wrestlers, or boxers, or baseball players. But for jiu-jitsu, a big ""no.""I do want to commend worldwide sport supply--they are processing my return on these with no problem. Good shop."

369574,2,I don't have much to say about this product as it broke the first time my son took a swing at the ball perched upon it... he's only four years old. The construction is flimsy - it's made from 100% brittle plastic. I would have rated it 0 stars if I had the option.
393956,0,The Stamina Body Trac Glider 1050 Rowing Machine seems to be a good buy for the price. Doesn't take up much room. There are two look outs. The first being that the seat is unpadded and hard. My wife puts an old piece of foam on it and is happy. The other is the foot straps. They don't hold her feet very well with or without shoes. This can be an issue since you need your feet to be secured to pull you back to the front of the machine. She has solved this problem by putting her feet under the foot pads and hooking her toes under them to pull her back to position. Since she discovered this technique she says it is a non-issue. We have had this for about a month and already she has used it more than any other piece of equipment she has tried in the past.
405958,0,I love gerber knives but this model has a very small and slippery handle. The thumb notch on the back is waaaaaaaaay to smooth. Is seems to be made more for looks than use.
436254,2,"This game was a huge disappointment. First off, the radio commentary is terrible. The entire 'play by play' sounds muffled which I guess is to simulate AM radio. Who wants to hear that??? Its annoying and sounds terrible. Also, he doesn't really say anything interesting. In fact, it is so generic that the radio announcers constantly refers to your team as 'the good guys'. So, when you score a touchdown, it will say ""the good guys just put up 7"", or somethign like that. Its really lame. They couldn't program your actual team name into the broadcast?? Another thing that bothers me is that the game constantly sutters. It affects your play on the field as well as the picking of your plays. It can be quite a tedious process. There are quite a few new features that have been added to this game, but its really nothing that special. If getting through an actual game is such a mundane process, it really cancels out the benefit of these new features. I refer to these new features as 'fluff'. I definately don't recommend this game. Whats strange is that I really like NCAA 08. Its made by the same company right? I'm not sure how the quality of these two games can be so drastically different."

I really like the armband, especially Tracy's trademark he puts on it, but for [such a price] Come on people. It's just an armband. I went to Champ Sports and got a package of Swoosh wrist bands [that were less expensive] I think some athletes are highly overrated and although I like Tracy McGrady, he is definitely overrated."

317841,2,"I essentially purchased these tires because they were relatively cheap, they had decent reviews about their ""silkworm technology"", rolling resistance, and the orange matched my frame. I doubt I have ridden more than 300 miles on them and have had at around 4 or 5 flats. I do live near a college campus, so I can't deny there isn't hidden glass in parking lots and the roads. Despite this, I have had flats when riding back home where the streets are good quality and there is no street litter. I have been fairly disappointed with these tires. At least they didn't cost me too much."

Somehow a workout on this is easier. But I still break a sweat and feel like I've accomplished something.It is super small and super lite. Very easy to store in my small apartment."

408456,0,For those who think brake levers come in pairs this one does not so a pair will cost you over $120 bucks even though the add does use the word these in the second bullet of the description.Alsothe product does seem to be top notch quality.
431446,1,"I've been buying Thorlo socks for several years now. I wear them every day (I'm retired), all day, and take a 4 mile walk in under an hour, on a dirt and rock road, each day. These socks are worth every penny. Their comfort and long wear capabilities are unchallenged. I have both the Wool/Silk socks, and the Coolmax socks. Although they are both wonderful to wear, I like the Wool/Silk the best."
311468,0,"There is nothing wrong with this product at all, however, I wouldn't have purchased it if I had been given a better impression. The title states ""Ray-Ban Aviator Small Metal RB 3044 - Gunmetal (52)"". However, who knows what ""Small Metal"" is? I was under the impression that the frame, perhaps, was thinner. I do believe that the ""Small"" needs to be placed before the ""Ray-Ban"" in order to make it known that it's in reference to the size of the whole product rather than just the ""metal""."

99335,1,"Alight here's the skinny on this road bike. It's cheap, ya gotta come to terms with that. The frame is relatively heavy, the shifters will need A LOT of tuning in the first few weeks of riding due to cable stretch. The tubes that ship in the tires are absolute garbage. Mine popped just after filling it once and letting it sit in the garage (Inflated to proper PSI). The brakes are... less effective than most. The derailleurs are bottom-of-the-line but seem to hold up to the rigors of everyday riding.However, once you get over the small issues, it's actually a very good deal. For less than $300 you can't get much better as an entry level rider. It really rides actually very good and the tires shipped with it are intermediates, meaning they can handle a little more rough terrain than slicks, and I can still keep up with riders on slicks.I tore off all the stupid stickers and replaced the design with a little custom paint work. People do comment on how nice it looks, Only I know really how cheap it is :DIn essence, it is a project bike. I have already replaced the cables, tubes, bearings, crank and brake pads. Still, the whole project is much less expensive than buying a really gnarly professional bike (and customizable!). After I get new shifters, it will really be a great ride. I am a bit of a bike mechanic and I am enjoying the experience of tuning the thing into a great little machine. Putting it together and learning how to tune everything is easy with this setup.Finally, I have to recommend this bike for BEGINNERS or CASUAL RIDERS. I give it 4 Stars because it is not perfect, even for the money. I doubt it will do the trick for racers and competitors. I use it for commuting and exercise, and it's the best thing going. Just keep and eye on all the bolts and cables. REPLACE THE TUBES IMMEDIATELY, fill with sealer. Have fun and obey the bike traffic laws."

131975,1,"In 1965 I bought a heavily used Orient automatic watch in a Japanese pawn shop for about 1000 Yen. I used brass polish to clean up the crystal after scrubbing everything else. The watch turned out beautiful, and I wore it for the rest of my Marine career, including two tours in Vietnam. I wore that watch until I retired in 1973, and for 10 more years as a civilian until it finally quit. Not bad for what was a 3 dollar investment at the time. I loved that watch so much, I got married in it twice. The only mechanical device other than my 69 Volkswagen beetle I ever got emotional about.My new Invicta watch evokes some of the same feelings. Love at first sight when I opened the box. At first, it felt heavy but when I put it on my wrist (after having a link removed), I didn't notice the weight. It is a beautiful timepiece, somewhat resembling a Rolex Submariner without the coin-edge, but rather a scalloped bezel, After three weeks it has not lost or gained even a second. I am a little puzzled about the lack of a screw-down winding stem on a diver's watch rated for 600 feet, but since I don't dive, swim, or take showers wearing it, for me, it doesn't matter. Furthermore, adjusting for inflation since 1965, I probably paid less for it in real dollars than I did for the used Orient way back when. I get a lot of compliments on this watch as well.The Invicta folks themselves must be proud of their creation, because their name is displayed not only on the watch face, but on the bracelet and edge of the watch itself. My only complaint would be that when I received the watch, It was running. For how long, I do not know, but I suspect I may have to replace the battery soon.Finally, if you want to see some great attention to fine detail for a timepiece in this price range, all you have to do is grab a magnifying glass and look at the watch face. &#34;Nuff&#34; said. I'll probably have them bury me wearing it."
381782,0,"The Pedometer has a program where you can hook it up to your PC and the data from the pedometer is transferred, graphs are made and your progress monitored. The program malfunctioned on the 5th day and apparently I have to wait for 41 days of this program/cycle to pass to see if it starts working again...which it has for others but time will tell for me. This snagged has dampened my enthusiasm and is certainly a negative to this product."
362812,0,"Revised:I gave these goggles 3 stars before, but I'll change it to 4 now if I can.If what you need is to keep the water out of your eyes for recreational swimming and playing, these goggles are a good choice. Another reviewer said they were very good at keeping the water out at first, but after a few uses, they may leak; originally I had agreed. I've changed my mind because the leaking may be operator error. After using them for awhile, I forgot to put on the straps as recommended by the packaging. If you do it correctly, and you shouldn't have the problem I had which was - by the time I'd get from one end of any pool to the other, I'd generally (not always) have to lift them up to drain them out. Swimming laps, this was annoying. Then I remembered the detail about how to put those straps on right. They may steam up, but the leaking will be minimal, if I get any at all.I wear goggles, not so much so I can see underwater, as to protect my eyes from water-gunk and from the burning sensation of chemicals. They're and worth the $5.00 I spent for them on sale at a department store. I'm not sure I'd want to pay Amazon's price + shipping and handling."
314364,0,"I figured since my pants are lasting longer than my jackets, I'd order just the jacket. I'm still happy I purchased this item, but it is tissue thin.If you're looking for a really thin gi jacket (for say, summer), I'd recommend this one. I would not say it would last 30 seconds at Judo as tt doesn't seem to be built to take punishment. As a light weave that is to be expected, but when this takes ""light"" to a new meaning...So far it has survived a couple washings (and a little abuse, so it isn't completely fragile) and it makes a nice break when my main gi is a little too ""fragrant"" to wear between laundry days, but I wouldn't recommend this one as a replacement for a heavier weave top!"
365384,1,"My kid loves his new gi. It looks sharp, and it doesn't hinder his movement, come undone, etc. He wore it happily to his first belt test.The sleeves and cuffs required hemming, but that's a plus for growing kids. Hint: a glue-gun does the trick and is easily undone/redone.We got exactly what we ordered, and the quality as every bit as nice as I'd hoped. Good communications and prompt shipping rounded out a great buying experience.I'll order again from this vendor."
510861,0,"I am somewhat new to diving so I thought this would be a great addition to my gear to be able to see my dive profile as it was. My wife and I both have the Mares Puck Wrist computer. The cable works as it should, downloading data to your PC. *** NOTE: This is NOT compatible with 64 bit systems! *** It's a good thing I had another PC in my house that is 32 bit, or this would have been returned immediately. From gathering information from other reviews, I downloaded the software from the Mares website to have the latest version. It appears to be a nice log book that can store a lot of information on the dive. There are some quirks about it in that some boxes are not greyed out, but you can not check them, while others are checked and greyed out that don't apply. Also, the drop down list of type of dive would be nice to have an 'add your own text' rather than having to choose the predetermined ones. When looking at the dive profile, there are a bunch of bar graphs that appear, but you have no idea what they're for. I believe this is for some sort of tissue loading, but it's pretty worhtless without telling you numbers. The user manual is pretty lacking. I guess once I dig into the program some more, I may teach myself some other finctions, if other finctions are in fact available... This is more a review of the software rather than the cable, but the two go hand in hand. Knowing what I know now, I think the price tag is a bit much. I wouldn't pay more than $25 for this, so unless you really, really, REALLY want to see your dive profile and if there's any yellow or red for rapid ascent, I wouldn't bother buying it, unless you get a great deal on price. I think the software could use some more development, and definitely 64 bit user friendly."

If its good enough for Israeli citizens who are constantly under attack, its good enough for me.I recommend trying it on and familiarizing yourself with the strap system before you store it.

166139,0,"The light output is very good for such a compact unit. It has a nice broad spread with a bright punchy beam in the middle. Lasts about 90mins on a charge. I use it for commuting, parts of which are in complete darkness. It makes me really visible in traffic. perhaps not enough light for downhill racing in absolute darkness, but plenty for cruising along dark back streets or dirt tracks at night.However, I have a problem with the battery charger. NiMH batteries are easily damaged by overcharging ([...]). For such an expensive light (yes for a glorified torch it is expensive, but the convenience makes up for it) you'd expect a reasonably smart charger to prevent damage to your expensive batteries. They cost only a few $$ more to make than a dumb charger, but nope, you get a real dumb one. There is no info on how long to charge for, and the charger will simply keep going till it kills your battery if you forget it. Easily done if eg you drain it on your weekend riding, then plug it in, go to work, and notice it on Wednesday - by that time the thing is really hot to the touch, and has been for days. (oops)."
377425,2,"I can only say I bought this elsewhere last year and it worked ok what little I used it, but almost impossible to keep the wires connected to the charge controller. Any little bump and they want to pull loose. The sunforce solar panels I bought -- 15 Watt Amorphous set -- seem good and the connectors are easy -- not sure why they jury-rig you to bare wire to the charge controller rather than their very good modular connections for the panels and to link the panels together. If anyone knows if the larger Sunforce charge controllers are better I hope you post on those -- I'm going to go look."
36790,0,"I ordered this halter for my ""average-sized horse"" Bella. It was HUGE! We can't even make holes in it because the metal part will rub her face. There needs to be an exact sizing chart so that you don't have to guess at the size you should purchase. I searched everywhere on Google and could not find a sizing chart, so I ordered the ""horse"" size. I'm just going to keep this halter since I have to pay to send it back, and I'll purchase another one from a local store instead (although it will be more expensive).Even though the sizing was very wrong, the halter is a VERY GOOD VALUE for your money. It seems to be made really well, and I like the hook on the side. I just wish I could actually use it."

Also the gloves were a really tight fit for a 16 oz gloves, I ended up re-purchasing from Amazon and got the Protex2 Training Gloves for $18 more but they fit much better. Would not reccomend the Everlast Pro Style Training Glove if you have fairly large hands, my hands are not really huge but average size for a man."

This is supposed to be for 40 to 80 pound dogs, I also went to the Mountainsmith website and measured her per their instructions. I have both underneath straps tightened as tight as they will go and the fit is stable like that, so I don't know how this would work on a dog that weights any less than 60 pounds. I think the breast strap is just a little too low on my dog's shoulders but it still works okay. The pack seems to be made well, but we only use it to walk around town so I never put too much in it."

35265,0,"I bought my Urban Rebounder from HSN Oct, 2010. I was excited that someone came out with a rebounder that I could fold and put away because I have such a small place. The UR I received appeared to be new and not refurbished. It did have an odor, but after a while I never noticed it. The DVDs were new, no fingerprints or scratches. The first time out of the box was difficult because it is tricky trying not to hurt yourself. My husband helped me, and the instructions say to have two people unfold it, but to always have another person around isn't realistic especially as much as I use it. I eventually sucked it up and said ""you can do this"" and now it's not difficult at all - you have to develop your own technique to unfolding and then folding it back up so you don't injure your fingers or strain your back. You also need to clear the area first before unfolding it and make sure that it's not going to fall on anything or anyone.I tried out the most of the exercises on the DVDs that came with the UR. I didn't have any problems with the DVDs as so many did. After a while you just get tired of the DVDs and find that you don't need them. I use the UR in conjunction with another exercise video - hopping off the UR, doing floor exercises, hopping back on the UR - and even for 30 mins I get a really good workout. I bounce watching TV or as I'm listening to a podcast, whatever you need to keep the workout going.I owned a $30 rebounder and didn't realize how cheaply made it was until I compared it to the Urban Rebounder - not that the UR is at the top - but is much better than my cheapo. The mat is stronger & more durable and the mat springs are considerably larger. My legs really felt the resistance of the mat springs. I went overboard with the bouncing and my legs were very sore the next day. You do develop strength in your legs from constant and consistent bouncing and you won't feel sore anymore, just keep doing it!I don't know when it started but I noticed that the Urban Rebounder became very noisy and then the legs became wobbly. August 8, 2011 - 10 months later, I was folding it up and one of the legs popped off. The leg spring that attached the leg to the rebounder had metal fatigue, where it just stretched off of the hook. The leg spring still had the loop on the end where you can see where it was stretched. It resembles tendons that are twisted together and at one point there is a hole that resembles the eye of a needle. I called HSN who referred me to Urban Rebounding, who told me that because I was out of warranty I would have to purchase the spring. Each spring cost $4.75 + $8.95 s/h...outrageous! My husband went to Orchard Supply Hardware and bought a spring that was a bit shorter at the loop but it cost $3.25 w/tx and was made in the USA. It was more than I could handle because it takes some strength to replace the spring, so my husband did it for me and he does nice work!Jan 2, 2013 - The black skirt that stretches around the springs became loose. I thought, now what? The corded elastic broke and revealed raveled edges and several rubber ends resembling veins. I removed the skirt and painstakingly started snipping the threads that held the elastic around the skirt to get to the broken ends. Using forceps (handy if you have them) and patience, I was able to tie the broken ends together and hand sew the snipped threaded area using buttonhole thread. Ok, so far so good and it's holding. Urban Rebounding wants $29.95 + $8.95 s/h. It was either I fixed it or I was ripping it off, but I wasn't about to buy another one for that price.January 11, 2013, after bouncing, I proceeded to fold up the rebounder and another leg popped off. This leg spring ""snapped and shredded"" and the loop is still on the hook that holds the spring. I called Urban Rebounding's customer service. My complaint was that the springs are cheaply made and were most likely made in China. She insisted that all their parts are made in the USA. I told her metal made in the USA does not shred - at least I don't think so. I did check and the country of origin is China. I wish I could post pictures of the condition of these springs.The Urban Rebounder has not been sitting idle and its been put to good use. Two years later, the mat springs are still noisy, but are still very strong and not stretched out in any way - play music, a DVD or watch TV and you won't notice the noise. The strong mat springs plus the durable mat still give me the resistance as when new. The folding legs are somewhat wobbly but stable enough when you're bouncing. I'm not looking forward to the periodic replacement of the leg springs but that's the downside of the springs. I'm fortunate that I wasn't bouncing when the leg springs broke! It appears that the company does expect the leg springs to snap because they have instructions on their site on how to replace them and I'm thinking to buy the parts from them!If you do buy this Urban Rebounder, be prepared to do maintenance to keep it in top form. Personally, I would not buy another rebounder from UR knowing what I know now. If I had a larger place and if I were able to lean it against a wall without bumping into it, I wouldn't have considered a folding one. I would go to a sports store and test one out and ask a lot of questions about the durability, warranty, etc. If Bed Bath & Beyond carried a rebounder, I would buy it from them only because they have WONDERFUL customer service. (It's awful that mostly everything we buy is from China. If I were to take everything out of my house made in China, it would be empty...)"

117657,0,I was looking for a leather cleaner and conditioner for the leather seats in my car and decided to go with the Lexol cleaner and conditioner sprays. I honestly was not very impressed with this product. The cloth I used to apply the cleaner with did get a bit dirty which was a good sign of it removing some dirt but the leather looked almost the same once I was done.The back of the bottle says that this cleaner is not meant to remove stains which I thought was kind of rediculous considering that this is a cleaner it should clean not just remove a little bit of dirt from the surface. My car is a 93 so the seats are pretty worn and have some cracks present. There are a couple of dirty areas and stains that the cleaner was not able to remove.The main positive thing about this cleaner is that it is not very expensive. I will most likely look for another cleaner once I am done with this bottle. This product is most likely intended to maintain newer clean leather but does not clean old leather very well.

I bought a size 36 x 32,which I normally wear, but they came out bigger in the waist and I have to fold them an 1 1/2"" to fit me properly.

Upon receiving my credit card statement, I noted that Eastbay retained an additional $6.50 for a ""restocking fee."" So, I ended up spending $15.48 for two pairs of shorts that I did not indeed keep. Hmmm, so much for a great deal at a mere $9.99 each! That will be an end to my online shopping through Amazon or Eastbay for apparel."
65722,0,"I bought this item to wear while hiking in the summer to protect my arms from ticks. It was a great, lightweight piece of clothing, but while the fabric wicked away sweat well enough, it also reatined the smell of said sweat. After a long day of hiking in the woods, this shirt was somewhere in between ripe and rancid and everyone around me knew it! On other occasions when I was not exerting myself as much it functioned perfectly, wicking away persperation and not retaining the scent.Other thoughts, I bought white, and wish I hadn't since it doesn't come all the way clean, even with pretreating and bleach. My shirts are now a very subtle shade of gray.As long as you aren't someone who gets cold easily, this shirt would probably serve extremely well in early spring and late fall. Being a hot bodied person, I see myself using this throughout the winter.ADDED AFTER 1 YEAR OF OWNERSHIP:I should have mentioned in th eintial review that there is no elastic at the wrists, so protecting your arms form ticks is OK, but they can slip up under the cuff pretty easily.Also, I wear these infrequently. Since getting them, I have probably only worn them about 15 times, and I have noticed that the elastic at th eneck is failing and the shirts are getting lose around the neck (I hate that feeling)."
172279,1,"This knife is very well priced. It is made with the quality of high end knives that punch way higher than it's price range of 30-50 dallors. Aspects such as solid grip, no blade wiggle, and a decent pocket clip creates ease of drawing as well as re-clipping give this knife it's value. ALSO the assisted opening ""Speed safe"" mechanism is excellent it has never opened accidentally and i have been using it as a EDC knife for 2 months now. Speaking of every day carry, this knife was designed with that in mind. It is very lightweight.The only thing I would say is a small disatvantage may also be it's greatest virtue. The blade is kind of thin. The seration hang off the blade kind of far and may be flimsy. I read another customer's review that said they folded over when he was using it on some fairly heavy duty material. At the same time he was comparing it to a benchmade and that's like saying my ak-47 won't engage targets at 800 yards as effectively as my m4a1, I mean come on! HOWEVER the blade is ULTRA sharp possibly sharper than could be achieved with a thicker blade. And on the topic of the teeth they are sharper than the blade, and they easily dig right into just about anything. At the same time I wouldn't recommend prying ANTHING with this knife it is a slicer. It's a great knife for the money (although that statement always seems to imply cheapness but that is not the case here this knife has great value).In conclusion this is a great, light, inexpensive, high quality, assisted, EDC Knife. BUY IT!!! NOW!!! AND NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT!!!"

93228,1,"My husband had me order this for him. I did and we got an e-mail stating that you received our purchase request. The very NEXT day we got another e-mail stating it had been shipped. And .. if it wasn't the next day, it was the day after that and THERE IT WAS! Not only are we impressed with the quality of the product, but we were blown away with the order/ship/delivery time! Thanks Amazon, for your purchase processing!!The hiking pole is exactly what he had hoped for. Light, versatile, and guaranteed to last! VERY PLEASED!!"

18820,0,"When ordering this product I thought the mat would be thicker than it is. It is not as thin as a regular yoga mat, it might be twice as thick even, but I thought it would be spongier. The mat has a bumpy texture which helps with stickiness. It is a good length. Comes in a great variery of colors. Mine was the same color as the one in the picture. Wish it was thicker though."

360260,0,"I purchased two of these and used them a few times. They are easy to pack and easy to setup. We loved having them. Then one of them started to leak. I thought it would be covered by the two year warranty. Unfortunately, I found that the two year warranty is for the pump only. I think that is very deceptive for such a big company to do this. There is nowhere in print that states the warranty is for pump only. But the customer service rep said that is the way their warranty works. Some box even say three year warranty. That is for the pump also. All aerobeds are warrantied for one year only. I thought Aero is the best name for inflatable beds, no any more."

59367,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed. Thank you ladies, for your review comments, as I rely on these to make my purchases."

497332,0,"You can barely tell you have these on, very light material, stretches so you don't feel them pull when squatting for example.My only complaint is occasionally they will grab an ass hair and not let go. I'm not a very hairy man but a few times a day a hair will get caught and you basically end up pulling the hair out. I guess I'll have baby smooth bottom in a few months."
176426,0,"I love this brand of shorts which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, I misunderstood the description and when I click on different links to the item, it changes from Juniors to Girls. I understood Juniors to mean teenage girl age. As a 20 year old girl, I can easily wear a M/L in these shorts for Juniors/adults. When I got my package, I received a Youth Large instead. I had to give the shorts to someone else who could wear them because I needed them on a time crunch. This is a good brand, just a little confusing on the description."
53971,0,"When I received this scope, it looked great and felt solid. The construction of the scope was great being that Bushnell makes great products overall. My only complaint is that the crosshair seem a little fuzzy. There's also some distortion when looking through the scope, you can almost see a square around the crosshair. I don't know if this is defected or if they are all like this. Overall, pretty happy but going to check to see if what I have is normal."

We're now playing with a flimsy set, just ""making do"" until we can get some replacement posts. The set looks good, is inexpensive and is fun, but too much plastic to be sturdy."
200395,0,While well made this holster does not fit my Kimber Ultra CDP II very well. To get the pistol to fit I had to loosen tension srcews past where they would stay in holster. I finaly have come to a happy medium in holstering and retention.This after appling leather softener. I have bought the same kind of holster for my M&P and did not have this problem. May be it is because I bought black this time instead of tan. Tan seems softer right out of the box.
386769,0,"These would appear to be great for the price: leather, washable, wrist wraps-- all very impressive. The only problem is, if you frequent the gym like I do, they just don't last long enough. I use the gloves probably four days a week for an hour each day (I don't use wear them on leg days or when doing cardio), and probably wash them every three weeks, and let's just say they aren't the best stitched gloves. One pair I bought actually lasted me six months, but the replacement only made it to six months after I got my wife to sew up all the rips. On my third pair, they are not looking good after two months. These will do the job for light usage, but I'm going to treat myself and try to find something that lasts longer."
391597,2,"Can't really rate the performance of this piece because once I slapped it on my scrawny wrist, it failed. I was able to set the time, then as i began the heart monitor, major fail. Indiglo didn't work, nothing worked. Forget trying to open this as well. With the 4 screws, and band that unconventionally wraps around the back case, it becomes an impossibility. Unfortunately, that was the only way to reset the watch. Again, fail.I give it one flush."

345748,0,I ordered X-LG but received M. I decided to keep them since they're terribly comfy and roomy.(and well-made) If they'd sent the right size then maybe a 4 star!
24941,2,The rope is pretty nice out of the box .. but once u get to re adjusting its length according to your height - its a downhill journey from there on. The metal clamps provided just bend out of shape and then there is no way of getting them on to the readjusted length.I also tried the option of simply tying a knot with the adjusted length - the drawback here is that the rope will not rotate freely when your are skipping it and will just get tangled ..Disappointed at the design ..
352857,0,"This product is great except that it doesn't include the 6 dealer buttons as promised by the product description on the website. For that alone, I took 2 stars off."
462882,0,"I bought this after analyzing quite a few wraps to replace the one I had purchased at WalMart 5 years ago for $8.They dont carry ANY of these now, so I had to search online.I only use these to hold an icebag on my lower back after exercise about 5 times a week, nothing else.My Walmart one is thicker and lasted 5 years before it showed a tear in it.I've only used this Sportline once. Its material is thinner, but it seems okay. The velcro holds strong, but the long run quality cant be determined yet. It could break in a couple of months, or it could last years. it seems decent for the price, but theres no telling."
404219,0,I thought my 3 year old son would love this but he says it's too big. Maybe it will grow on him.
470636,0,"Overall, the socks weren't bad, but I was hoping they would be taller. I thought they were knee-highs but they only reached my mid-calf. They were also quite thick for a midweight sock. The color was great! It's hard to judge based on a computer image, but this one was quite accurate. The cardinal red was dark, deep red - exactly what I was looking for."
140517,0,"This is a great game. You actually can break a sweat playing it. That said, the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because(1) it lacks support for lefties. Some activities it doesn't matter; others it does. For the activities where it does, the game will not register moves correctly if done left handed. Taking that into consideration, I put myself in their shoes...It's not easy to do some of the activities with your non-dominant hand...like lefties are expected to since the game doesn't offer a lefty option.(2) it lacks support for additional weights. The resistance band that come with the game is...well let's just say it doesn't have much resistance even folded up. I play the game on hard and still find it necessary to add resistance; however, sometimes when i use weights, the game doesn't register my moves correctly."
17008,2,"I have a Schwinn bike and assumed the Schwinn light would fit, but I was wrong.I emailed customer service at Schwinn and they didn't apologize for it.I ended up getting a Cateye light which was so much easier to install and didn't require any tools.Do not bother with this Schwinn light. It is big, bulky, won't fit on a Schwinn bike and harder than it needs to be to install."
65022,0,"This scooter does nice tricks and has nice grips as well. It is easy to adjust the handle bars too. I do great tricks such as grinds on the curb and tail whips. I have two complaints about this scooter though. 1. When you are doing any type of spin move with it you have to move your legs out of the way. The scooter has hit me in the leg or ankle many times and now I have a scar because of how tough the metal is. 2. Even if you ride into a tiny rock on the road or even your sidewalk you can fall off. I don't recommend riding on the sidewalk because the wheels are horrible on the little sidewalk bumps. It is great for wheelies and riding on smooth surfaces or doing jumps off of things. Overall, I will buy another."
356252,0,I bought these pants for my husband for him to wear on his softball rec team. They are well priced but a little thin. I think that it'd be better for him to wear something under the pants (spandex or shorts). But overall okay quality!
408848,1,"Great product. They work great. Me and my kids use them while we watch TV. You must watch the DVD before you start using them. Never realized I was doing my dumbbell exercises the wrong way. You will do them more efficiently after watching the DVD. Save time, space and money and buy them from Amazon. Purchased with the stand--delivered in 3 days. Also purchased the 3.1 bench--delivered in 5 days."

109863,2,"Purchased at local Sports Authority for $130. Quality and finish are great, however, the 3-hinge design is horrible! Not really sure why there needs to be 3 hinges since 2 hinges would suffice and be more stable for child. I had the same problem as a previous reviewer in that the child's bike would be leaning while we are riding straight! Yes, I understand you can't make tight turns/corners, but we were going straight. Granted, the extra hinge allows for greater mobility, but that isn't needed for a ""tandem"". My son refuses to get on and my wife and I literally had to stop riding at least 10 times over the course of 7 miles to straighten the hinge - annoying. Yes, the bolts were tightened down! However keep in mind, some seatposts are made of aluminum and you don't want to bolt down in it TOO hard b/c it will crush it. We used 2 different brands while in CO on a family trip down the 10 mile CO Trail and those worked perfect b/c they were 2 hinge designs. Trust me, if you decide to buy this tandem, you'll see what I'm talking about. Tighten down the bolts all you want, but it will eventually happen b/c of the 3 hinge design flaw. It was the hinge closest to the child that swings left/right that just wouldn't stay straight! If they got rid of that hinge then this tandem would be perfect! Its very hard to describe unless you can see it visually. Regardless, we brought it back and I am now searching for something else."
318806,0,"I did my homework when I bought this as my first HRM. It was well worth the money... well until now: 10 months later and I'm thinking it's not right to expect to spend $250+ / 10 months to keep this going. Just the other day, I went to transfer my recent workouts from the watch to the computer, and whenever I started the link to PC, my whole system crashed - everything went down. I finally diagnosed the symptom as a hardware problem (the software runs fine if the transmitter device isn't plugged in, and I tried different USB ports too all with the same results). So now, what's the value in my HRM? Another disappointer, my foot pod for the SDM broke a couple months ago. The battery cover jammed, and I can't get it off or on, and the thing won't turn on (I had just put a fresh battery in before the cover jammed). Otherwise, I really liked the product, although it was my first, so I don't have an expert opinion on the matter...."

I don't know why wire cutter has replacement jaws as my old unreplaceble cutter blades worked fine. Pliers are very strong & positive."

138110,0,I wanted a utility knife for skinning and quartering game. The knife has a decent edge and the edge holds up okay. The zipper is handy for iviscerating w/o puncturing. The knife is a little wide for close in work but is well suited as a general purpose skinner. Probably wouldn't want to cape with as it doesn't get into tight spaces well. The texturized handle gives a good grip but it's a bear to get the fat and blood out of all the crevices when you are cleaning.Overall a decent knife for the money but not a one knife does it all in my book.

22625,0,"I agree with other reviews that it is rather odd that the light defaults to a blinking setting, requiring you to push the button twice for a regular, steady beam of light, but consider that to be a minimal problem. The real problem I have with this headlight is that I've never been able to get the mount to ""lock,"" so the headlight keeps slipping down. More often than not the light just ends up illuminating the patch of ground directly in front of me."
292502,0,"Was dissapointed to find that the Kleen Kanteen is made in China. You may want to think twice before using this container indoors or at work. When you take a drink from it, it makes a chirpping sound that makes people stop and look. Other than that, it is easy to carry."
191318,2,"I ordered this as a perfect cart for the beach. Of course, this thing has cheap plastic wheels and by the second use the wheels were coming off of it. Don't waste your money. I can't return the thing since I didn't use it at first, it sat for about two weeks. The first time it was fine, I put a small cooler chest on bottom and our towels in the mesh bag. It was a little hard to drag through the softer sand, but not too difficult. On the second use, about a month later, the left wheel got all wobbly and wonked. Now it's useless.Update: Since this review I have managed to get the cart fixed by going to Home Depot and picking up two 8"" garden wheels and replacing the wheels that came with this product. They slipped onto the axle rod perfectly. Now the cart works nicely. Of course, I had to spend $20 on the wheels..."
128523,1,The compass arrived quickly and performs great. I have noticed that if the compass is subject to a lot of vibration it spins crazily. The bungee cords are a must to support the compass unless you are installing it on a very stable and vibration free surface.

221132,1,Great Hat. Not garish nor distractive in style; can be worn w many coat styles. Plenty of weather coverage and won't blow off. Great if you don't want to carry an umbrella.
82748,0,"I hand washed one of these shirts with no soap and it takes 20 minus plus just to get the detergents out. I have no idea why, when so many people have allergies, a company would leave tons of detergents on the fabric. The shirts are good quality but wow why do we need to but so many chemicals right on our skin? is it the chemicals in the shirt that make it shed sweat ? and if so what chemicals are in there ? it says 95 percent polyester 5% cotton on the garment. What are they not telling us ?"
115609,0,"These are cut a little big, and that's pretty typical for a rain jacket. It feels rubberized to the touch, and does keep you very dry. There are air vents under the armpits small enough that they should't let water in-- great feature. There are also two huge pockets on the front to keep items you need to keep dry.The only thing I don't like about this jacket is that it makes a lot of plastic noise. If you're out in the rain, this doesn't matter, but any time it's not raining you're going to be ""loud"".If I am going to be wearing a jacket for rain purposes I would personally prefer the Columbia Omni-tech or Titanium Tech jacket. Far more stylish, quieter, and better ventilation, at more cost."
106802,0,"These are nicely styled compared to what is available as hiking shorts in any local stores. My only complaint is the use of velcro to hold the pockets closed. It is necessary to 'peel' your pockets open thus, it takes two hands to put your wallet back in the pocket. Try doing that while sitting in your car. Otherwise, nice shorts."
86680,0,"I bought this from my local outdoor store and after a getting used to the action I just couldn't stand it. Don't get wrong, when the knife flips out you can tell it wants to do business by how forceful it pops into place, but that's if you didn't accidentally lock it.I carry my knife in my front pocket and I would say that one out of every four times I wanted to use the knife I noticed the lock had been engaged by some random action while it was clipped to my pocket. For that reason I can not recommend it's use for selfdefense and can only recommend it as a backup knife with a belt/cord cutting feature.++ Spring and action+ Blades ability to keep and edge-- Locking mechanism will engage if you keep in on your person."

437728,0,My son who is 7 likes them when they work. They don't fire hard enough to burst the paintballs.We end up picking them up off the ground and reloading them to keep trying.Not sure what we can do different.We keep the paintballs indoors because we have heard that they do not burst as easily if they are cold but this has not made much difference yet.Hoping that this summer with the heat it will make a difference.

510325,0,"I had an Eddie Bauer mattress that I liked better, but that one was almost double the price, and after two years of steady use every weekend it finally started leaking. This mattress does lose some air overnight so it must be re-inflated daily, and works better with two people on it to distribute the weight. It blows up fast and when you place a sleeping bag over the top it's much more comfortable than trying to sleep directly on it. So far it's held up well over the course of several months when using it for most weekends. The sleeping bag also helps to insulate you from the floor, which makes it not feel so cold. We use it inside the house only so I can't comment on how it does outside. No major issues so far and not bad for a cheap mattress."
373135,0,The pants are well made and warm to wear. Around the waist and ankles its nice and loose but around the hip and crotch area very tight. The pockets are right in the middle of my hips and because of tightness will be hard to use. Except for in that area they are comfortable to wear but unfortunately will not be ordering this sweatpant again cause of size issues. I did order a large and anything bigger and I would be swimming in them but they are just a bit to tight. Will stick with purchasing sweat pants at local stores from now on to assure comfort. Shipping from this company was fast and had no issues with them.

343106,0,"This is one of Cathe's step DVDs from her STS Shock Cardio set. It's described as a 45 minute step routine with athletic step moves, rather than dance-like step moves. I liked this DVD much more than Cathe's the Step Moves, the other step DVD in the Shock Cardio series.The format:**lengthy warm-up (6+ minutes)**3 step routines**3 step routines all together**athletic drills**NO cool down**stretch.What I liked about this workout:**the lengthy warm-up**the step routines were fun. The routines were more complex that I would have expected from a DVD billed as ""athletic step."" I like complex choreography, so I didn't mind. This makes the routines more interesting for me.What was neutral about this workout:**the music. It was more of the techno hip hop music that Cathe uses in her recent DVDs. It was okay, not as annoying as in the music in her Step Moves DVD. The routines were on the beat of the music, which is a plus.**Cathe was somewhat subdued in this DVD. I missed her energy and enthusiasm! I thought her cuing was okay, but then again I don't need a lot of explanation for a move.What I didn't like about this workout:**Some of the moves are very twisty and turning, and hard on the knees. In the 1st routine, there's a core repeater off the step, you then twirl around to the back and walk to the back of the room. No way was I going to risk wrenching my knee on this move since I workout on carpet.**In the 2nd routine there's a skip across the step move. My feet get all tangled up and I'm really afraid of tripping, so I skip this move as well.**The athletic drills after step routine 3. They seemed to be just stuck in there to fill time. Maybe the workout description should read ""athletic step and drills."" They weren't that intense, so I didn't consider them to be drills, more like additional moves.**NO cool down. At the end of the drills, Cathe states that we should cool down on our own before doing the stretch. Well, that's not going to happen for me. It might have been better if the warm-up was a tad shorter. This routine is not that difficult or intense that a 6+ minute warm-up is needed. Cutting 2 minutes from the warm-up and using this for a cool down would have been good.Overall, this was an okay workout. I'll do this one more frequently that I do Shock Cardio Step Moves."
332249,2,"Very dissapointed overall since it was horrible to put together so many little pieces. Not the seller's fault, the item description was good. For some reason I thought it was going to be easy to put together. I won't buy anything like this again!"
423596,1,"I bought this for my five year old son for Christmas, I was worried he was a little young but common sense did not prevail. It looked awesome next to the tree and Christmas morning he was very excited. We tried taking it outside but the weather wasn't good. It was a long snowy winter but once spring came. All he did was ride this bike on up and down the sidewalks. Its so cool the neighbors had to get it for their kids. My son rode it every day in the summer and as soon as he gets off the bus He asks "" Can I ride my motor cycle""All the other christmas toys are gone or Brooke or.. But almost a year later he loves riding this every day."
396882,0,"Several months ago I purchased 3 sets of these for my many night time, early morning or rain runs - and for the most part, I am very pleased. They are highly reflective, brilliantly colored, and definitely have proven their worth to me at least 4 times in oncoming traffic. The pop band is easy and fun, however...the only real difficulty I have found is that they are very stiff and have a tendency to create irritation from their ""sharper"" plastic edges. For example, you might want to be wary that wearing them around your ankles over bare skin and not over long pants can be pretty uncomfortable, with the edges of the band digging into your skin, causing small cuts. This is less of a problem around your wrists, given the motion of your ankles. But another thing to note is that they don't close cleanly around either ankles or wrists - there seems to be a little curve on the end that doesn't allow them to fit snugly and cleanly as the picture shows. Also, wearing them around biceps is fine, but they do tend to slip downward into the curve of your elbow. Wearing them anywhere but on the wrists requires constant adjusting and ""re-popping"" during your workout to get them to be comfortable again or stay put. Unfortunately, these challenges have actually led to a new search for something a little more friendly for wearing on bare skin (considering Jogalite cloth thin bands). All this being said, I still think they are fabulous for placement on a jogging stroller, bicycle, or over clothing. I've worn them in full out downpours and would definitely classify them as waterproof and easily cleanable, another plus. You won't go wrong with these, just remember that where you intend to wear them will make your experience happier or not. :)"
318481,2,"I love the looks of this watch -- sporty, but not as bulky as most running watches. I wear it all the time. However. . . this is the 4th one I have bought. I like it so much I keep hoping I'll get one that lasts. Two of them have had the ""stop"" and ""start"" buttons fall off and one of them had the band disattach itself. I have not mistreated my watches. There seems to be an inherent flaw. I am about to mail all three bad ones back to Nike and see what they have to say for themselves. Your price is great -- hope I get my money's worth out of this one."

86771,1,"I wanted to wait a good while before writing a review. After owning this knife for a good few months I'd definitely buy it again if i had lost this one...Theres hardly a day that goes by that i dont use my knife and its held it edge and there is no wobble between the blade and body (if there was, all it takes is to tighten an allen and your good to go!) i was concerned about the quality of steel used but ive pryed and done other things that a knife isnt usually used for and its held up fine! I originally was going for the Cold Steel Recon 1 but when i got it, It was HUGE and didnt have assisted opening. The tanto blade also had a very steep angle, too steep IMO...i love everything about this SOG and i WILL buy anotherGreat knife, Wont disappoint!"
385934,1,"I bought this for my 5YO for fun. We do a lot of camping and she wanted a compass. This one is cheap, and will probably not last long. It isn't highly accurate, but what do you expect?It is a great (for lack of better word) toy. It consistently points North, and that is all we need."

59888,1,"I bought these because sometimes is the right application in some rigs. Terminal tackle is a must in every serious fisherman or anglers alike. This specific 3 way swivels are #1/0 wich means is big for some applications but, you can choose your size as well. I like to leave home prepared... do you?"
483454,2,"The display on this watch is very hard to read. The numbers are not black but gray and this makes it difficult to read. Depending on the light you may have to angle it to be able to read the time - not very convenient! The strap is very plastic looking and the whole watch was was much more juvenile looking than I wanted. I decided to return the watch to Mr Watch - be aware that they charge a 10% restocking fee, and then took out additional money to cover the initial shipping despite the fact that I got free shipping. So in other words it's only free shipping if you keep the watch, if you return it you pay to ship it back (which is fine) but they will then charge you for the initial shipping. In fairness it does say this in their return policy if you go looking for it but I've never seen this anywhere before. I called customer service at Mr Watch and they did take care of it and said they were looking to change this policy but it's something to be aware of."
441517,0,"Bought my first pair of these, and loved them. They where incredibly comfortable, and I raved about them to anyone who would listen. As another reviewer noted, they wore very well.I bought a second pair I loved them so much, and have been disappointed. After a couple months one shoe (left)started to squeek with every step; very loud and driving me crazy. I assume this is due to some internal separation between the sole and body of the shoe. In addition, the sole has started to separate from the body around the sides, also mentioned by a previous reviewer who owned multiple pairs.I emailed customer support multiple times, about the problems and never received a response.This is incredibly dissappointing, as I love the comfort and appearance of the shoes. However, in this day and age for a company to ignore obvious problems with products, and NOT to respond to loyal customers, means I will have to look elsewhere for my footwear in the future.Not recommended."
36174,2,"To be honest, I really wanted a Burley trailer for my kids and I do even more now after having dealt with the Quick N EZ trailer for a year. Our first trailer we got for $25 at a garage sale. It was also InStep but I don't see that they make this style any longer. It had a hard plastic base as opposed to the canvas most (if not all) trailers are made of these days. My son would slip and slide all over. After just a few minutes of biking with no suspension and no seats, he'd be slumped down with the straps around his neck.Needless to say, I wasn't going to make him endure that any longer! So we picked up the Quick and EZ for $80. We were pleased with how easy it was to set up and how quickly it folded down, though it still wasn't small enough to fit in the trunk of our Grand Prix. We now have a Sienna so it's no longer an issue, but my son's comfort was immediately a factor from the first time he was put in it. The hammock-style seat is straight up in the back, so when he falls asleep he just slumps over and looks very uncomfortable.Not only that, but the airflow inside the trailer is a HUGE concern for me. After 10 minutes of biking in 80ish degree weather, he is beet red and soaked in sweat. Now, he is not in direct sunlight so that's not what's heating him up. It's that because the hammock seat is canvas and because the seat effectively goes from ""wall to wall"" inside the trailer, there is nowhere for the air to go, even though there is a vent in the back of the trailer. We started putting him in shorts and nothing else to try to keep him comfortable but he still gets extremely hot. How can I enjoy my ride when I know he is miserable?And you can forget about putting two kids in this thing unless they're very easy-going and don't mind being squished together. When I was a daycare mom, I would regularly take my son and one of our daycare kids who was only 4 days younger than my son and about the same build, and the first few times they did nothing but fight! Sure they were two 2-year-olds, but can you blame them? The hammock seat forced them to lean into each other and make them even MORE hot! Would you really enjoy riding in the car if you were pressed up against the person in the seat beside you the entire time? Not likely!Aside from that major complaint, I do have to complain that the small wheels and lack of suspension make for a very bumpy ride and I also feel bad subjecting my kids to that. Also, it would be nice if you could only partially lower the sun shade to keep your baby protected. When we're going in the wrong direction, he always gets sun on his thighs and sometimes even his arms if the sun is high. We always put sunscreen on of course, but if I'm going to expect him to sit in there while I bike for two hours, I'd like to make sure he's comfortable.So, all complaints aside, the trailer has one big plus. It's price. You can't beat the price, but you get what you pay for. This summer I am seriously considering spending one of my bonus checks to get my son a wonderful Burley trailer. Yes, it's $450 and probably not practical if you only bike once in a while, but seeing as we bike daily in warm weather and sometimes 2-3 times a day, I think the price is justified to make sure he enjoys it as much as I do. Burley trailers come with large wheels with suspension, a roll bar, PADDED BUCKET SEATS!! with mesh on the upper part to allow for good airflow, and padded seatbelts.Yep, definitely getting a Burley this year! I've waited long enough! ;)"

265401,1,"I bought this knife years ago directly from Cold Steel (sorry Amazon) when it first came out and it has proven to be one of the toughest and most used knives I own. It is almost perfect as a camp knife. It has enough heft (while still having a great balance) to be a good ""chopper"" yet it doesn't weigh you down. The only thing that would maybe make it better would be if it had a solid steel pommel (instead of it being covered in rubber). But, I'm not gonna complain about that. Rest assured that there is solid steel under that rubber so it's there, if needed. This thing is one solid piece of steel and is definitely made for ""using"" and not just ""lookin' pretty"" up on some shelf. If I happened to have some big, bad bear (or guy) come after me, I'd definitely want this thing on me. I would imagine that this thing could probably punch through a skull and not even think twice about it. Not that I'd necessarily do that but . . . just sayin'. :-)"
332755,0,"I bought this for my recumbent trike and was disappointed to find out that it didn't work for me due to the computer not being able to receive the signal from the wheel transmitter. The distance between the two was less than 3 feet. The computer and wheel unit need to be within about 18"" of each other for it to work. Guess I will try the wired version."

228263,1,I got this for my husband and he totally loves it! The size is perfect and it can carry his basic stuff when he goes biking. I also like the thought that it's not just a pouch to carry your stuff but it has the basic tools needed for a bike run (which some people usually forget). It is not bulky and looks good on the pole of your seat :)

173629,1,"I had heard of these from my brother who is much more of a skilled angler than me but last weekend when he took me fishing he gave me one of these to try and man was he right! This was fabulous for bass fishing, I fished again this week and lost a few of them due to breaking in half after a hit and he recommended a small rubber like ring to keep in on without cutting them in half at a bite. I hope to have a chance to go by the store and pick some up to see if he is right. Very pleased good lure for me."
422217,2,"It will hold a bag up, but you could probably buy a couple bolts at any hardware store and create a mount just as good.

388420,0,"These socks have a thick gold cushion that will protect the toes. The sole of the socks is noticeably thicker than the top half, which can be seen though when stretched over the foot. The opening of the sock is tight, making them difficult to slip on and off easily. The opening feels like there is a thread that will eventually break. The socks are labeled 12-16 but are very tight even on a size 13 foot.Overall, these are great quality, but the size is misleading. Ultimately, they were returned for a refund."

276698,1,"These are really comfortable volleyball shorts! They're nice and tight, unlike a pair of asics shorts I have which are really lose and make you feel almost as if you're not wearing shorts. They are also the right length. Some spandex shorts are really short as to show your butt after playing for a while, but these don't. When pulled straight, they're a couple inches long, but they also curl up after playing a little and moving around. I don't mind that though, I like it when it curls up. Plus, all spandex volleyball shorts I've tried curl up anyway. It's long enough that it doesn't show your butt even when it curls up, and it's short enough to make you look like a volleyball player rather than a cyclist or something."

I got a 'size larger' thanks to other reviews, Because it's kind of tricky putting on and off without tearing it, and I ONLY use it when i'm on my treadmill. It does work though in helping you sweat more, But be carefull with it, if you're going to buy it."
108002,0,"I liked the concept of the product. I think the whole idea was great. But I can only give 3 stars for two reasons.First, the smell is terrible. I can only hope that the material is pure natural latex, but there wasn't any mention on what it's made from.Second, the tensions aren't correct. The green one is supposed to be 30 lbs. and the black one 40 lbs., but it felt the other way around. It was way easier to squeeze the black one.I just hope to see some improvements of this originally well-conceived product."

293005,2,"I bought this bike for my 5 year-old because I thought it would be a good bike--wrong! The bike is EXTREMELY heavy, bulky and not a good fit for a kid. It is even hard for me to carry up and down from my SUV. The first time we tried to take my son for a ride he was crying the entire time and complaining that he was unable to lift the bike from the top of him, how sad is that?? I would not recommend this bike to anyone! I then decided to spend extra money and bought him a Specialized bike, in aluminum, so much better!! It is not for sale on Craigslist."

A few days before I needed it, I received a message telling me that they canceled my order!!! I will never order anything offered by Fogdog again!"
492725,1,"With a battery that recharges under light, a TZ that can be changed via the press of buttons, a tele-memo capacity of storing important numbers for when your pet cell phone containing all the numbers does not happen to be handy, for its alarm utility which I have used many a times, this watch is a winner. A bulky one too - and if you need reading glasses, this watch is a constant reminder to wear them - you know what I mean.It is a bit bulky and requires getting used to if you wear a watch 24 hours a day. But add the position-sensor backlight feature, and a rugged look and feel, you are looking at a watch that declares that the nerd has arrived.Purchased at a local store, which is on target most of the times, I spent about a third of what this one retails here."

309371,1,"After reading the specs about the bag's size (as it's at least 2-3 inches wider than most ""oversize"" bags), we bought this on a whim in the hopes that it would be just big enough for me and the wife to cuddle inside when the temps got too cold to use as a simple unzipped blanket/comforter.......and it does so with a little room to spare and actually move around some without feeling cramped. Granted this wont work for everyone. I'm 5'5"" @ 195lb and the wife is 4'11""@ 90lb. But should give you an idea as to the real size. Love the attached quick connect draw-straps w/buckles also. If i Had any complaints at all, its in the finish stitching (there are loose strings everywhere and pulling to tear them off would pull the stitching loose). Oh, and as stated b4 there is no stuff sack included and there is no way its a 5* bag. 25* at best, cause even with two people inside me and the wife were simply comfy at 50* last night. Me being a ""warm"" sleeper at that and didn't have to vent to keep from feeling too hot.For these reasons, I cannot give it 5stars. A great bag at an amazing price. Would not hesitate to buy again or recommend to anyone wanting a similar bag."
253784,0,"The rod and reel combo are good; however, don't expect too much from the extra flys and spinners. They are of low quality and are not worth using. The spinner reel does not have line on it.

211306,0,I followed the directions for taking care of them. They worked great for the first few weeks. No fog whatsoever. But now they fog up almost instantly and I'm constantly washing the fog out. It's annoying. I wish they still worked as well as they did when I first bought them.

The foam also breaks and cracks. I used these for about 2 weeks and had one break in 3 during sparing. Going full speed they do pack a punch. The beauty is that you can spar with no gear on, just watch the fingers."
367423,0,"We are using ""solar shower"" as an outdoor sink and shower. The tube came kinked and always wants to fall into that position which stops the flow. The nozzle leaks unless we get it above the highest point of the water. It does warm up in a day of full sun but generally these two issues make it far from a high quality product.

It only provides resistance in the backward direction.That being said, it is VERY good for the price.

The description lists these shorts as having a 10"" inseam. I wish I had read his review before ordering! I called the store (1-800-569-9038) and in their system, this short DOES have an 8"" inseam, so they think they sent me the appropriate item. They need to fix the info on this page! Anyway, I was determined not to have to pay return shipping for their error. I explained the situation, and they are sending me a FedEx slip with postage paid and I can return the shorts in that. So in the end, I will have to eat the costs of shipping the shorts TO me (they won't refund that) and of course, I never got the shorts I wanted. At least I don't have to pay to return them, thank goodness. Still-- it's annoying."

You can still benefit from using it, but the quality of shooting on target is extremely difficut to manage as the ball bag slows the ball down considerably making your shot difficult to judge on its power and accuracy. Nontheless, I've managed to tailor it to work well enough for it to be worth keeping."

Also I love that it's heaviness keeps it from curling up on the ends; once it is spread out, it lies totally flat right away. The place mine was purchased from didn't have them wrapped in plastic, they just have a paper label around them, so mine must have had time to air out; there is almost no rubber smell unless you put your face right up against the mat. It feels really thick but it is bouncy, you don't feel like you are sinking in, it is really stable. I got the orchid color and it is just gorgeous, it is a cross between a lavender and a rose color. Highly recommend this mat, it feels like it is going to last a long time!"

Wrong! I don't know if its because I have really long legs or what but the rope keeps getting caught on my feet. In order to jump successfully, I have to really bend my knees.I don't mind having to bend my knees because then it pushes me more, however, for those with knee problems this could be an issue.Other than that like I said, the jump rope gets the job done and the handles haven't broken yet."

Also I am going to have to bed the action on this brand new stock because the stock is so close to the barrel on the left hand side that if I use a sling and really sinch down on it to shoot offhand then it comes in contact with the barrel. Not real impressed, great idea....I just think they can do better and should. If I where to buy this product again it would have to be the full length block and not just the pillar bed action model that I have. Hogue's other products that I have are top notch and have never had any problems with any of them, and other than this product I would highly recommend them in an instant. On the other hand there is nothing wrong with the stock if you are familiar with or willing to do a good bedding job on a new stock."
503642,0,"these bottles are light weight and have no adverse taste associated with them. however, they are very easy to dent. i ordered two, one of which had a large dent when it arrived from amazon. the other was dented within two weeks. the replacement for the bottle that was dented on delivery was dented after just a few weeks."
330783,0,the thing about these wristbands is that you can't really see the purple and red on the rainbow. other than that they're fine.
36423,1,I got this for my daughter to take on a rough camping trip in Canada and it stood up beautifully to the elements.
89511,1,A great buy. My son wears soccer balls out like crazy and this ball has lasted the longest by far. Welll worth the money.

109577,1,"these are by far the best goggles ever. they were created by molding the plastic and foam to the eye sockets. they sit on the bones, with very soft sealing foam. they don't press into your eyeballs.anyone who is getting a great seal or find them leaky is probably not sizing them correctly. I agree that the sizing and fitting can be a little tricky. but once they are dialed in there will never be a more comfortable goggle."
437257,0,Great gloves well made also has great padding I gave it a 3 star because these gloves are made small. I purchased a XX-Large and these were really hard to get on they felt like a large I would give this glove 5 stars if they fit like a XX-Large should fit. I actually used the measure chart located on their website and these gloves still felt very small. I ended up returning these gloves. I wish the manufactures would make a larger size to fit a larger person with big hands

418430,1,"I wanted a bike carrier for my 250 Kawasaki Enduro and chose the AMC 400 Lightweight Aluminum Dirt Bike Carrier to hang it on the back of my Grand Cherokee Laredo Jeep. I am glad I did. The only problem was with the Anti-Tilt Bracket which was defective right out of the box. I wrote a letter of dissappointment directly to Discount Ramps and they sent a new one to me at no charge. It works perfectly. Needsly to say, I am glad I did bussiness with them."
280048,1,"I purchased this product so that I could use it to inflate a tube I'll be pulling behind my waverunner this summer at the lake. This product was really amazing in that it filled the tube (which is large) in only a matter of 2-3 minutes. My previous air pump would have taken significantly longer. It comes with a few different connectors, so I could plug it directly into a boston-valve or smaller plugs. I purchased this item knowing it would have its drawbacks - the fact that it must be plugged into an electrical outlet is one of them. It would have been nice if this could also plug into a cigarette lighter in the car, but I knew that going into this. It's very quiet and does the job. I'm satisfied."
258671,1,"I had never used a speedloader before, but once I got the hang of this one, it was pretty perfect. Matches up with my cylinder perfectly, and twists easily once it's in position. It took a bit to get the hang of it, but once I had it, it was easy. There are only a couple hang ups I have. First, the bullets feel a tad loose inside, which is fine because they actually don't fall out, but its just the feeling. Second, occasionally, it won't lock. It's fixable by taking the rounds out and putting them back in, but I can't figure out what is causing it to begin with. Again, these are issues from a rookie speedloader user, so it's probably just me. Other than that, this thing is great. I keep a loaded one next to my .357 Mag in the safe at all times. It's also cool for the range because I can be loading it while my wife is shooting and vice versa. At this price, you can't beat it.Does work for a Chiappa Rhino."
14992,0,The watch will do what I need it to do. But one reason I choose this watch among several others is because the seller described it as having a black Velcro strap. It is true that the Velcro is in fact black. However that is on the inside of a bright blue band. And the band is build into the watch and does not look replaceable. I needed this watch to wear with my military uniform. So I'm going to have to dye the strap black. Other than that the watch works great.
391073,0,Handle broke after about 1100 rounds. It was nice while it lasted. Going to purchase the drill attachment. maybe I will be able to save this trimmer using the attachment.After purchasing the drill attachment I was able to trim 3000 cases with out any problems. It also saved my hand and arm from hurting.
100067,1,"Easy to install. Quick release makes it easy to get on and off. Side pockets are great for cell phones and cameras, front pocket great for wallet and keys. Does not bounce around as much as other handlebar bags. The padding/insulation takes away precious space from the main compartment and the space fills up fast. If it was 2-3"" wider and deeper, and didn't have all that padding, it would be a perfect handlebar bag."
439430,0,"Don't get me wrong, i like the knife and all but i ordered THIS ONE (wooden (plastic) handle and gold outside but instead i got one with the handle in silver and instead of the imatation wood i got a red and black one with a scorpion in the middle .... i didnt feel like dealing with returning it and waiting all that time to deal with just a handle, its not like i hate it or i would have but it would have been nice to have the RIGHT one"
431581,0,"Most people will buy the guard for looks as well as some practicality.I'm one of those!The hand guard fits somewhat loosly in the regurgetated mount from the wooden cover, and it needs some fine tuning to make it a bit more solid.once it has been fitted to your liking, it basically does the same job as the wooden part did before, other than maybe a bit better ventilation and air flow to keep the hands safe.Having said that, the SKS is not a fully automatic weapon and in that respect probably never gets to work hard enough to need a lot of mega cooling.Mine does get fairly warmed up when I shoot continually to keep targeting skills up, but it isn't going to leave burn marks on my hand by any means.That leaves cosmetic purpose in the foreground.It does look good on the T1 stock on my particular rifle and that is never a bad thing.Material wise it is made well and has some springy give to it, which makes me think it will last while trudging through the local jungle with it.The guard is finished in a dark gun blue and looks like a true heat bluing job rather than a parkerized finish.What more to say? It may even enhance the look on your wooden stocked SKS.In any case it will work no matter how you put it. Thx John."
35252,0,"I just got mine. I have the black cover with strange white markings. I took pictures because I am considering returning it. I tried wiping the marks off and they did not just wipe off. I took a wet rag to it. Lots and lots of wiping and I got a small section of the marks off. There were only 2 or 3 styrofoam pieces in the box. If they left all these marks, they were busy little guys!I will try it for a day or so and decide if I will return it. The markings sure make it look bad!!!"
47520,0,"While these weights are okay (and not all that uncomfortable), the write-up and information is very misleading. The weights are billed as 1-5 pound adjustable. There are actually 1/2 pound weight packets and to get 5 pounds you have to wear both belts at one time. Each weight is 2 1/2 pounds max. I was looking for 1-5 pounds for each ankle and this isn't it. If the description had been more accurate, I would have ordered other weights."
200795,1,"If the product was a little longer or came in 3XLT rather than just 3XL. it would be perfect. Cotten is not heavyweight but is very lightweight. That being said, it is the only sleeveless Tee I can find in 100% cotten, so therefore it gets 4 stars."
428719,1,I run 4 days a week and they are comfortable for exercise. Not a bad price. Socks are ridiculously expensive.
363767,2,"Straight out of the box, I read the instructions, inserted the CO2 cartridge properly and automaticly the bottom (which wasn't secured properly) Started leaking frigid CO2.I like the model and I'm really upset that I paid over $100 for it.I hope that it was as a fluke, because I really like the style of the pellet gun so I returned it for a replacement.Knock on wood with your fingers crossed that the next one they send is made with quality.I will post an update when I get my replacement.UPDATE- The same thing happened! I wouldn't pay $0.99 for another one."
328783,2,"Twice this item arrived damaged. Also, in both cases the cardinal on the helmet is uneven and disproportionate to the rest of the helmet. I didn't discover the damage on the replacement until after it had been autographed. Amazon refused to issue a refund. I highly recommend purchasing somewhere more reputable like [...]. It may cost you a little more, but at least you will receive a quality item."

227481,0,"I bought the Black/Calypso Blue Summer 69 pack, and it's not quite as pictured here. Mine has the same colors, but they are much brighter.

377859,1,"This H2O pack worked great for my white water rafting trip. I got dehydrated on my last trip, which was absolutely no fun! I was determined not to let that happen again. I liked the fact that this one held more water then some of the others. It was comfortable to wear, even under a life vest! It also has extra pockets to hold other things that you don't want to lose on the river. This was a two day trip, and I was very glad that I brought this along. It's also easy to put together and to take apart and clean. I would definately recommend it!"
56405,0,The pants are well made and warm to wear. Around the waist and ankles its nice and loose but around the hip and crotch area very tight. The pockets are right in the middle of my hips and because of tightness will be hard to use. Except for in that area they are comfortable to wear but unfortunately will not be ordering this sweatpant again cause of size issues. I did order a large and anything bigger and I would be swimming in them but they are just a bit to tight. Will stick with purchasing sweat pants at local stores from now on to assure comfort. Shipping from this company was fast and had no issues with them.
242815,0,Used to buy these all the time now the material is somewhat flimsy and thinner than previous RA tee's. Would recommend seeing a store sample before purchasing. My ten year old RA's are more substantial after hundreds of washing and machine drying. The size is a little small for a large so avoid dryers if want it to last awhile.
68539,2,This was almost impossible to get over my head it was so tight plus it's only water resistant. You might as well buy a cheap throw away poncho because this one is no better.
470736,1,"Invicta is quality through and through. They are like pringles or tatoos. You can't have just one. They will look, feel, and function like the quality items that they are. You can't go wrong with an Invicta-especially this one."
437994,0,"Made the entire pouch with water heated in the microwave, stirred, removed most of air and zipped pouch shut. Took out about half, added some shredded cheese and a few crackers. First bite left a taste I couldn't quite place, eventually found the red onions that I try to avoid. Onions retain a slightly off texture. Over all, not bad - may consider taking on next India run, travel delays and dramatic time zone shifts do rearrange your eating patterns. Need to figure out how to split a pouch and get and maintain an even mix of contents.Had the remainder rewarmed, was better the first time, less oniony.Product arrived on time and as described."

And it is really lead-proof that I accidently put it aside in my bag and i was so worried the water would come out from the jar. However, it didn't! What's more, it can help to cook congee with hot water after hours. It is another function which is very helpful!"
118782,0,"these gloves are fine for my cardio boxing class, i do not recommend them for anything more serious."
503189,0,I was hoping these would be a bit darker so i could also use them as sun shades as well but as it is they are great for spotting. The world tunes up to a bright blue and once you get used to them everything is crisp within view. I like them better than yellow or amber for clarity.
478873,1,All I needed was a new one and this was great(You would have to go out of your way really mess up a Jock)and the price was just what it should be.Thanks.

81742,1,The Bianchi 100 holster seems to be very well made and my Beretta Bobcat 21 fit perfectly.It fits very comfortably inside the waist at about the 4 o'clock position.
95338,1,I used these shifters to replace old Shimano 8 speed shifters on a Gary Fisher Tassajara mountain bike. They installed with out a problem and shifted perfectly. I would recommend this product for an 8 speed shifter replacement.
473328,0,Bought this item as gift. So cannot make a comment on this item at this time. But the price was right.
495117,2,"I purchased this sight based upon the Pentax name for quality mechandise and its specifications stating it was durable enough for shotgun or pistol applications. I mounted the scope on a .22 rim fire rifle that has negligible recoil. Within less than 100 rounds, the red dot became intermittent because the rheostat knob had become so loose it was not making contact. The Pentax warranty says they will repair the scope if the unfortunate buyer pays the postage to send the scope to them and includes a check for $19.95 to cover the cost of the return. Their work is guaranteed for 90 days. So for half the cost of a new scope you can take you chances that their second try to provide a non-defective product will be successful. I don't think I'll send good money after bad, but buy another brand instead."
74943,0,"We really wanted to love this tent, but the screen porch is not designed well. It has no floor and and no REAL wall. The screen that divides the main tent from the porch does zip all the way around, but the nylon ""wall"" is open on the bottom side and flaps in the wind. I would not buy this tent again."
33840,1,"This is a perfect rescue pump. It will allow you to put approx 60-80 psi in a standard road tube. I have not been able to get more than that. It attaches to your frame and does not really get in your way, although I do feel it brush against my calf from time to time - especially when grinding up a hill.The pump has a very short stroke, but pumps on both the ""in"" and the ""out"" strokes. This is certainly not something I would choose to use on a regular basis. For rescue purposes, it works fine.Nevertheless, I have found that CO2 is simply easier to carry in my saddle bag to do the same thing. I found a CO2 head that actually has a very small hand pump as well that fits in my saddle bag. This allows you to put a few pounds of pressure in the tube when changing a flat.In any event, if you need a rescue pump - and don't want to use CO2 - this is the best one I have run across.Also important - the frame bracket covers the head so no dirt gets in the nozzle."
20741,0,I ordered a Quake Kare item but received a different brand. While the item I received works for my purposes I do not trust this seller anymore and will never order from them again.

111498,0,I bought a set of these rings for my Ruger 10/22. I was using the factory scope mount and these do not bolt on tight to the mount. They wiggle around even when fully tightened down. It seems like the scope base is slightly narrower than the rings and they don't pull quite tight enough.That being said I still gave three stars as I can't be sure if the issue is with the base or the rings. The rings fit the scope very well and have a very good finish.I contacted Weaver support and they recommended I use the Weaver multi-slot base #48335 and Weaver 4- hole skeleton rings #48360 for a 40mm scope. This setup is rock solid for the 10/22.Google around for weaver Ruger 1022 loose and you will find plenty of similar experiences.
476096,1,"I received this watch from my husband as a wedding gift 15 months ago-I love it. I hardly take it off, actually. It is a gorgeous timepiece and I have received many compliments on it. I don't plan on owning another watch for many years and I believe that this watch is built to last."

293322,0,"I have a few automatic watches, none costing more than $1000. Even though this is a cheap watch (by automatic movement standards), the power reserve is quite low. I can wear this watch for 2 straight days and it will completely stop after being idle for less than 24 hours. Also, the automatic winding rotor doesn't feel smooth when you shake the watch, possibly from a low jewel count. Nice watch for the price but bottom-barrel automatic movement. Time is accurate, though."
54370,2,"I received this watch 3 months ago as a birthday gift. Loved the watch, the features and look were great. Then this week, the plastic piece that is the bracket for the band broke off when I took it off. The plastic material it was made of appears to be substandard."
396824,1,"I purchased this fairing along with a complete set of Yakima landing pads, towers and bars for my 2009 Honda Element EX. The installation was easy and straightforward, with materials well selected - i.e. they are plastic, but of a grade that is rigid enough to fulfill their function, yet malleable enough to survive the swings in temperature."
413262,0,"I purchased these on a reconmendation of a fellow tennis player. I really never wear sunglasses except to the beach. So, honestly, getting used to wearing them was my biggest obstacle.My first try wearing them was at night under the lights. I managed to the ball well, but other things were too dark. Not recommende to that. Dytime in the sun, not cloudy worked best. They take away the glare and emphasize the ball. Peoples skin look like they are grey and dying. Other colors change too, such as the ""red"" court ,now brown. That aspect I did not like about the glasses. As a result, I hardly wear them. Oh, I think the price of them, is really too high for a pair of sunglasses. They are NOT scratch proof and for that price I think they should be.Service by Amazon was great."
468137,0,I did not care for the tone or feel. Took them off within an hour and put back on EJ16. They had a rough feel and were stiff. Lots of folks like them but not for me.

232803,0,"i really can't write a comprehensive review until I have more chance to use them. They did not work as I had anticipated. I thought they would make golf balls stand out (I know they flouresce under UV light). Instead, the glasses work by dimming the field of vision so the background clutter is minimized. I think they will work OK but need more time to use them. Right now, there are six inches of snow on the ground so I don't think anything will help make a golf ball stand out."
234419,0,"This product is great for emergencies - very small, light weight and great to take on outdoor activities for an emergency or to have in the car. It's very light weight (much like a mylar balloon). And while it can tear somewhat easily, it's made mostly for emergency use, not frequent use. It reflects body heat and can be really important for survival. Is a great addition during cold weather camping - lay over top of sleeping bag as an extra layer of insulation.As far as buying these on Amazon, keep your eyes out for frequent price changes - prices can vary by a great deal, both from seller to seller and even from week to week from the same seller, often by quite a lot. I've paid anywhere from $4 to $10 for a 4 pk., sometimes with free shipping, sometimes not.Big Fly sends them quickly, sometimes with free shipping. However, in trying to get information from them prior to ordering, responses have been only so-so. Also, on occasion, I did not receive the brand name that was listed on the description page (I received emergency blankets that were OK but the brands vary a lot and aren't always what's listed).I gave this only 3 stars not because of the product itself but because of customer service, not always receiving the exact product/brand name, and the wide variation in price.In summary, good product, can be a life saver, especially for the money, but keep an eye out for price variations and fluctuations."
314847,1,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to get the S&W; ""Magnum"" or the ""Pro"" range bag and as far as I could tell the only difference was the Magnum was slightly smaller. I wish I had bought the bigger one because this one is a bit smaller than I thought it would be.It will fit a lot of stuff but, for example, if I keep my two sets of Peltor ear muffs in their boxes they take up almost the whole main compartment. I realize that may not seem necessary, and I could just toss them in which would make more room.Also, I have 1 pistol in a S&W; medium pistol rug (very nice by the way) and the other gun (semi-auto polymer) is in the large hard plastic case that it came in. I had intended to put them both in, placing the hard case in the bottom of the bag but it is too big to fit.But aside from this the bag is very well made and solidly constructed - still four stars because it's my own fault for not carefully looking at the measurements. I may keep it but if you have a lot of stuff (e.g. two pistols) just make sure you get a bag that is large enough.Specs from the S&W; website:S&W; Magnum Range Bag-----------------------Rugged duffel style Range Bag works for many purposes.

366657,1,"I am very happy with them. They are similar to the Soffe shorts, but come in better colors in my opinion. They are cute with the waist band rolled down. I am 5'3"" and weigh 110, and the small was the right size for me. I often wear xs, but I am glad I got the small, b/c it's the right size. These are true to size, unlike the gap for example, where everything is big (vanity sizing)"

411078,0,"The product itself has worked as needed. It does eliminate dust. Air flow is good and it's not too awkward to work in. Two major complaints are; the ear covers are attached with thin plastic straps and one on mine was broken upon arrival (fixable with ca glue) and the instructions that come with it give bare minimum information. I still have a little tube thingy sitting on my work bench that I can find no information on as to what it is. Which actually brings up a 3rd problem, who do I go to if I have a problem? No invoice came with the product, that I could find, explaining warranties, return policy, contact information, etc. The Amazon price was only a few dollars less then other on-line sources and for the convenience of knowing I have a contact source I would not buy from this source again...frank arizona"
43809,2,"If you don't KNOW for SURE that this bag will fit your rack, you ought to determine so BEFORE you buy it.This is a great bag with many excellent features, BUT as someone else wrote, the velcro straps ARE short, and if your rack isn't exactly what is required, the bag will fit poorly and flop around.My suggestion: go to your local bike shop, find a rack (and perhaps a bag) you like, THEN try to find it on Amazon. These are very difficult to buy correctly without seeing how they'll fit/attach on YOUR bike."
485982,1,"I have a Bowflex Extreme 2 that originally came with 210 lbs of rods. Within 3 weeks of workouts, I found that I needed to increase beyond the 210 lbs in some exercises.

I am very happy with this purchase and will be purchasing the 410 lb upgrade soon."
148990,0,"I did some research into tires to use on my home trainer. This one had good reviews, but I saw some comments online about the difficulty to mount this tire to a rim. I've been mounting tires, both clincher & tubular, for over 20 years, and this was the most difficult tire to mount ever!!! Even getting the set side on was a chore, the next side was next to impossible. I broke one tire lever trying to mount it the first time. I reverted to the one thing I've never, ever, had to use, a long handled screwdriver. Yep, you guessed it, I punctured the tube!! So, I put another tube on, but only after five minutes to get even one side loose to change the tube. I was able to remount easier the second time, using three levers. No screwdriver needed.My suggestion is if you are going to mount these tires, do a dry run with a screw driver first (that is if you don't mind a small ding in your rim possibly) After that, the bead should be stretched enough to then mount with a tube in it.Once it's on, it's a great tire for the home trainer. I guess it's hard to put on so that it stays on under the stresses of a trainer roller. The compound doesn't heat up at all, and is less noisy then a road tire. The grip is great, no slipping when doing a sprint. I recommend that if you use a trainer (vs rollers), to take the load off the tire in between uses. Otherwise I'm sure you'll get flat spot.

10149,0,"I read the other reviews, but did I listen? I have very small hands, actually the only thing small on me, but I digress. I always buy small golf gloves, and I buy alot of gloves. So for the price I bought three pairs of these gloves. They ARE very nice and the price can't be beat. BUT, they are so small. I put them on and couldn't close my hand. I wore them to drive the car just to break them in. They do not have that nice little reinforced patch on the palm on the hand which I like so much. I will keep these, maybe I can break them in, not worth it to send them back. But buy them a size larger than normal. I think in the future I will continue to buy Callaway which are more expensive but they have the reinforced palm which is where I wear down the glove.Delivery was very good and packaging was excellent."
4460,0,"I received the Bokkens and when i started to unpack i just noticed it was not black colored as the advertise of the picture, but indeed is a pair of bokkens colored with natural wood and lace crossed and glued to not fall (not bad i think).Also i think is around 39"" and not 40"" full length.They're quite strong indeed and might be useful for sparring, but i dont think it might be for strong full contact. (but wood is wood, sooner or later must break)Is a good deal for the price of 2 Bokkens but if you're looking for the ones of this picture advertised, then look elsewhere :/Note: This bokken made of hardwood wont be sliced with a razor sharp katana. believe it."

205912,0,"4X6 rubber mats are sold at farm stores as ""cow stall mats"" for 40 bucks (they are actually even heavier than these and 3/4"" thick rubber) or ""trailer mats"" (exactly like these, 4'X6'X1/2""). Ironically trailer mats are often more expensive ($42), despite being thinner, so I'd go with the super heavy duty cow mats (they do weigh about 100 lbs each so be warned). They make excellent weight lifting mats (I have my basement decked out in them). In fact all of the online reviews at my local farm store are for people using them as exercise equipment and not for cows (this is in Wisconsin too)!!!The only downside of cow stall mats is that they can ""off-gas"" a bit and thus smell like rubber (this is because they are generally made from recycled rubber). From the description I have no idea if these mats will smell or not as that depends on the rubber used (recycled, etc.). However if you want to save money the easy way to get around the off-gassing of inexpensive cow mats is either to let them air out or seal the mats with a sealing floor wax (20 bucks for a jug of it at a hardware store, will do a dozen or so mats easily). Just wanted to let people know there are much cheaper options. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if these are in fact ""trailer mats"" with a 200%+ markup.I bought mine (about 10 of them) at Blaine's Farm and Fleet in Wisconsin. However your regional equivalent should have them (tractor supply company, Mills farm and fleet, etc.). As a bonus, many cow stall mats are manufactured in the US (mine were manufactured nearby in Janesville, WI), so you may even get a chance to support a local economy and not China!"

106046,1,"I thoroughly enjoy these pants. I've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities. These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I've been through - including 5.11, Woolrich, etc. I think the best feature on these pants - which isn't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side (for me, the strong side). This pocket, placed directly behind the front pocket (and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer's) has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached. The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size, such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis. My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over. These are great."
229960,1,"I was prepared to write a long, in-depth and detailed review of this kayak and it's features but I decided to stick to the basics and provide real world conditions I have experienced in the month I have had the Expedition.If you choose to stop reading this review from this point forward, let me leave you with one thought...The Advanced Elements Expedition is never the same experience twice. In this case, that's a bad thing.First off, you should know I have no experience with any other kayak. I did not test any others and bought the Expedition site unseen from Amazon. My main reasoning for purchasing a kayak was for a unique form of fitness not for recreation. I wanted something that would allow me to increase my heart rate, strengthen my shoulders and core, burn some calories, and ultimately lose weight. I have taken this kayak out a lot in the first month - an average of 3 times per week for 4 weeks.The majority of my paddling has taken place on a large lake in both calm, glassy conditions and with a light wind chop. I have also recently taken it on a swift moving river with a small amount of white water - probably Class 2.The very nature of a folding kayak lends itself to great portability but each time you fold and unfold it something will shift or reposition. I spend a great deal of time during setup moving, squeezing, dragging, and turning the inflation chambers and floor to make sure it lines up just right. If you don't and it's slightly off center or the main chamber is kinked you will not track in a straight line. Other reviewers have praised how well this boat tracks but only 2 times I can think of did it move straight when coasting. Like a car with suspension problems the Expedition either pushes to the right or pulls to the left. Some days are worse than others. One day I can go out and have a nearly effortless time but the very next, following the exact same setup routine I end up working twice as hard trying to keep it straight with each stroke. Last Saturday after setup the kayak looked perfect, everything was aligned, inflation pressure was dead on, and the skeg on the bottom was straight - but for every stroke to the left I took two strokes on the right because it wanted to swing hard to starboard. It was so frustrating I quit after 15 minutes. Upon inspection I could see no visible reason for the drift. But on Sunday - same setup, same conditions, same everything and, you guessed it, straight as an arrow.If you're not committed to spending a little extra time when unpacking it to get everything aligned just right you could end up being frustrated. Personally I would rather have the same predictable ride each and every time. You won't get that with an inflatable and you need to know that going in.Expedition supporters will undoubtedly question whether or not I have been following instructions and I can assure you I have been. Not only have I committed the manual to memory but I have been an active participant on the Advanced Elements website and make use of their user group site regularly and I have talked with the company directly as well. Keep in mind, I'm not bashing this kayak, I'm just stating facts I have experienced. I still like it overall.Now having said all that, I don't think you can find a much better value. I bought mine the day Amazon just happened to be having an extra sale. I only paid $479. You would be hard pressed to find a 13' touring kayak for that price anywhere. But there is a big ""gotcha."" If you are on a budget and expect to become a regular veteran paddler expect that price to double once you factor in all the other gear you will need. By the time you add a class III life vest, waterproof jacket or shirt, water shoes, a paddle, dry bags, and a few other odds and ends like a spare paddle (if your main paddle slips away from you) you will be in for about $850. Some things you simply can't skimp on. Safety is important - especially if you start your paddling adventures in the dead of winter like I did. One spill in 35 degree water and you only have about 15 minutes to find safety and warmth before hypothermia sets in. Again, that's not complaining just something you need to be aware of when you start thinking about your overall budget.The Expedition keeps you warm and cozy though and the fact it's inflatable means it is comfortable - no hard spots. I continue to be amazed at how rigid this boat is despite that fact it's full of air.Okay, so where does that leave this review? For me it's easy. No matter how frustrating the setup process is (like others have described as well) and no matter ho much energy I expend inflating it with the hand pump all of the negatives are neutralized completely by the fact that you can fold it up and take it with you anywhere! I love knowing that I can store this thing in my car and spontaneously explore the local waterways wherever I am. You can't do that with a plastic kayak and have to plan ahead. Just keep you paddling gear and kayak together and you''re ready to explore. It fits in the back of my pickup truck or in my wife's Honda Accord.So despite the challenges, I would recommend this kayak to anyone wanting to have something easy to transport. It's a little more work to achieve a smooth ride but provides the freedom to explore that others don't.I hope this was helpful. Happy paddling."
422165,2,I too had similar leak issues on the base where the water sits. I don't think this bag can handle the punishment. I had to patch 2 leaks so far.
490380,0,"Poor handle material for the SOG FSA-8 Flash 11........I've had this knife clipped on my pocket for just one week, and all ready I see a problem that's only going to get worse, just from sitting down and standing up with this knife clipped to my right front pocket... SOG has the best design for a pocket clip that I have ever come across, but the handle material on this model just doesn't hold up...The pocket clip is designed so that the knife will sit way down in your pocket and the handle of the knife doesn't stick up at all, which is absolutely great, but that design also puts a good amount of stress on the area where the pocket clip comes out of the handle area, and at that slot in the handle where the pocket clip comes out of the handle, I see the slot on where the clip comes out, becoming elongated and the pocket clip becoming very loose and sloppy...I feel that it won't be long before the handle material will have such a large slot in it, at the pocket clip entrance, that the clip will no longer be a part of the knife and the handle will most definitely be damaged. All this is with normal every day carrying of this model knife in my pocket for just one week. The handle material is just not strong enough to stand up to the normal stress that a pocket clip puts on the knife handle material. Other than that, this is a great EDC knife (every day carry)..."
499446,0,"It has a great price, but you get what you pay for. It has a very short stride. If you are looking for a cheap workout, it is a good machine. but do not be fooled by the ""silent"" part. It is not loud, but not exactly quiet either."
25810,2,"I was looking for more cold weather running gear. I read other reviews on this pant and took a chance. I never got to try them on because they sent me the wrong size. Then when I called to return them they had switched companies. So, I had to return the pants and then reorder from the other company. Not worth the hassle for pants I didn't even like looking at. They were super thin material. Buyer beware....."
221133,0,Hat was rain proof but the brim was not stiff enough to stay open in 20 mph wind. It would fold and catch on the hat so with wind and rain the had was not fully functional. Needed se way to keep the brim fully open to shield from the rain
497490,1,"I used this knife for the first time while diving in the Florida Keys. Even when exposed to salt water for hours on a daily basis there's not even a hint of rust on the blade (gotta love Titanium!). When the knife arrived the blade wasn't particularly sharp, but it only took a minute to sharpen and the edge has held quite well. The sheath that comes with the blade is excellent. It is plastic and the straps are rubber and it comfortably fits round a calf, even without a wet suit. The sheath holds the knife in place very well--after 20 dives it has never fallen out on its own. Plus, it can be easily removed with one hand even with gloves on. While there are probably better knives out there, you really can't beat the price for a knife of this quality."
240886,0,"""Made in China"" was an automatic loss of 1 star. Gerber used to sell high-quality, US-made products.The other star was lost for stiff blades/tools. I had to move them out the first time with a separate tool. Trying to do so with a fingernail (the design-intended method) resulted in a ripped nail. (I keep mine well-trimmed and short.) I then had to cycle them repeatedly to make them rotate freely.Other than the two items noted above, it's a decent tool and the suspension frame will make it easy to clean.The locking mechanism works great and the plier spring was a nice design touch.I haven't tried them yet, but I suspect the wire cutters on the pliers won't survive much beyond soft copper. (unlike the carbide inserts on my US-made Gerber Urban Legend multi-plier) A multi-tool should be a trusty companion for the odd jobs encountered on a day around the farm. Fixing electric fence wire is one of those frequent jobs.One big improvement I'd make to the sheath is a way to release the belt loop. I wear no belt, so being able to put a sheath's belt loop around my pant's belt loop is always a desirable feature."

435104,0,"The appearance of the product is fine, it was easy to ensamble, but i noticed some details about the top that i did not like the edges where the plastic is sawed has a lot of small holes that is making the water to go inside the tent, and also it has a part of the top that seems to be like ragged, and from the inside it seems that its going to brake. The screen also has some small details that seems that its going to brake too."
286238,0,"For me, the most distinct feature of this bokken is that it smells! Once the plastic wrapping came off, I got a whiff of the strong smell that seems to be all over this sword, but mostly on the cord wrapped portion. It smells like fake incense...and it was annoying enough to stink up my closet in a few hours. So beware!As for the bokken itself, it probably isn't strong enough for dueling, but you can probably wack someone with it a couple times. I bought four, so I will say that the wood stain is not equal on all of them; some are darker than others. Some do have imperfections in the wood as well, but for $10 you can't really argue.3.5/5"
82983,1,In most reviews I read that this tent requires 2 people to set up and takes about 30-35 mins to set up. I have set this tent up twice in the last 2 weeks by myself and have done it in about 25 mins. Last weekend while scouting for elk hunting I had the tent set up at 9500 ft we had a real nasty storm blow in with 40 plus mph winds. It Rained at least 1/2 inch in less than 45 mins. The tent remained dry with no leakage at all. Day time temps average 75 to 80 degrees. with the 2 doors and four large windows we had a great breeze in the tent. Night time temps dropped below freezing at night with a Mr Buddy Tent heater it heated the tent up in a couple mins and actually need to shut it down. Lots of room in the tent to allow you to stand and change. We use this tent for extended trips and actually use futon mattress and have a cot for my daughter. we still have a lot of room to store supplies and move around. This is the closest you can get to a full blown wall tent without spending $1500 plus dollars.

66769,0,This headlamp works well on camping trips when you need to have hands free for other activities. The white light is bright for easy visibility in the dark. The red light option is especially good when you are entering/leaving a tent and don't want to disturb your fellow bedmates.
429323,1,"Like one person already said. This is a Training weapon. It wasn't made for the occasional weekend airsoft skirmish people in mind. It was designed to meet the look and feel of the real thing as much as possible and used by the very people that will be using the real gun in combat. In real life there is no restart or should i say do it over. Using equipment to practice with that ""JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT"" is no point. When you plan on training for things that you have to chance your life on you want things to look and feel like they will in the real deal. So on the Look and Feel of the Systema Training Weapons I give it a 10 out of 10. Yes the price is high on here and you can even get them as cheap as $700 when u buy them unassembled in kits. (Just depends on who you buy it from or how long the kit box has been sitting on a shelf)If you want to play skirmishes with your friends... by all means get a TM or any other brand. If your a serious team player and want something that is as close to real life mil-sim then by all means suck it up, save up, and buy something you can be proud of. You get what you pay for. Until you actually shoot one of these you have absolutely no right criticizing the guns just because of a price you are too poor or stingy to pay.Other Ratings:- Accuracy 7 out of 10(20 Meters Results differ between guns and shooters)- Power 10 out of 10(Very easy to up or down grade within minutes)- Battery Life 7 out of 10 (I suggest to have a spare for all day games)- Realism 10 out of 10- WOW factor on the field when u pull it out in front of everyone at the skirmish 10 out of 10"
256386,1,"Over the past few years, I have developed a real love of lake swimming. We have a lake nearby that is always clean and pleasant, and on which no motorized boats are allowed. So nothing can run into you, the water isn't gross, and, being that I live in Wisconsin, there is nothing in the lake that views me as food. Pretty nice. I really enjoy swimming across and back (roughly 1 mile), but noticed that, without flippers, I feel just a little less safe out there (and I move much more slowly, too). These flippers are really well-designed. I like their look and feel on my feet, and I move more efficiently than I did with my previous pair (of a cheaper brand). Great fins, and I have every confidence they will last me a long time."
348283,1,My teammates and I bought this for our coach. It is a good product. The only thing that was wrong with it was the microphone screws on the handheld would not screw and it caused it to fall apart. But we just taped it together. Either way Coach is happy with it and it still works.

The only two issues, the top section for a size 40 is huge, I feel like I have a ton of denim over my chest, and the stitching in the crotch. If the bibs are not adjusted correctly at the shoulder straps, can rub a little when ya walk, if you know what I mean....."

Fluff up a cotton ball and let your friends and family give it a try - they'll be in awe."
214052,1,The gloves arrived in a timely manner and in good condition but they weren't what I thought they were which was my fault.

They will be helpful though in keeping my hands warm.

76316,1,"This is not your weekend pack; although, it can be used for that. This is for one or two week treks into the wilderness. For those purposes, this pack does the job very well. Although I have yet to use the hydration system option, it's there. It even has a usable and roomy detachable day pack.Our family owns two of these packs. We do a lot of backpacking, and these packs have our highest praise. I really like the number of pockets on this pack that make it very easy to access gear. The main compartment is accessible from the front, sides and top.The sleeping bag compartment is really nice. Misplaced your stuff sack? Just stuff it in here.Not enough room inside? This pack has plenty of external straps."
466897,1,"I bought this to replace my old Streamlight which was the 4 C-cell type. (The old one still works although the lens is pretty scrathed from use over several years.) The new one is much lighter hanging on my turnout coat (with AA batteries) and gives off a nice bright light. I haven't used it enough to cycle through batteries so I don't know how much saving there will be in that department. Of course the light is blueish-white instead of ""yellow"" like my old one and I don't think it casts as far but entirely sufficient for indoor firefighting use. I keep the old one as a spare in my truck now.I recommend it both.UPDATE: I was out on a wreck scene a couple of nights ago and used the light outdoors at night. It cast a good light to a tree line at least 100 yeards away (in the middle of a field out in the country with little light ""pollution"".) It wasn't ""spotlight"" strong but I was surprised you could see it at all at that distance. So I take back my comment that it doesn't cast as far as my old one. A good light. I'm glad I got it."
250101,0,"I ordered the heater as the weather turned cool. When I received it, I noticed that the knob on the on/off valve was lying in the bottom of the box. There was no screw to reattach it and the way it rotated indicated that there should be some kind of spring under the knob (also missing). I contacted the seller, but they did not have any replacement units to send. They said they had forwarded my issue to the Coleman rep who would contact me.Well, days passed with not contact. I finally looked up Coleman online and submitted an email. The response was almost immediate. The persona at Coleman just wanted a copy of the purchase receipt and a photo of the heater with the problem code she supplied written on the handle in Sharpie. Once I supplied these items, a new unit was shipped and I received it with no problems.This heater works very well inside an enclosed golf cart. It only takes a few minutes to make the cabin toasty and the heater must be turned down to a very low setting.This is an excellent produce in spite of the initial problem and Coleman did a five-star job of addressing my problem."
191422,1,"This is a pretty simple item, and it works as expected. I like the brass clip, as this will help it hold up in salt water longer."
248792,0,"The good news is this thing puts out a lot of heat. It will boil water faster for coffee than my power burner on my kitchen stove. It's heavy, tough, nicely chromed and finished and seems like a good value for the money.So why the three stars? Well, it's the heat. You can't turn it down. The lowest setting is blasting enough to burn any kind of food you might be trying to cook, and the burner simply goes out below that. If you're just making coffee, this is like a jet engine. If you really need to cook something, it has some problems."
430564,0,"I used this for about 2 months before one of the screws holding the clip on fell off. A few days later it stopped counting steps. This is the second Omron pedometer I've owned that eventually stopped working. They work fabulously for awhile and have excellent features, but like most things today, they don't last."

222512,0,"I read some of the reviews that said these gloves tend to run a size too small. So when I saw they referenced the glove sizes by the shoe sizes, I got the 10 to 12 inches, because my foot is only 10.5. But when I put them on, the gloves felt tight. I am almost debating returning them to get the next size up. So yes, take their size recommendation whatever range you fit into, and go the next one up if you want to make sure they will fit nicely."
439243,0,"Easy slide on -slide off mounting, large enough for a bag of groceries, sturdy enough for a frozen 20 pound turkey. Don't even think about using the handle to carry groceries though, it can barely support the weight a sack lunch and sweatshirt. Can only be used with a Topeak rack. Suspension seat post or oversize saddle may interfere with fit."
425979,0,I have used the band off and on for a few months. It does provide some relief for tennis elbow. If i used it more consistently perhaps I would have had a better result.
225016,0,"This is nice quality. My only problem with this is it does shrink some in the dryer. It wasn't a terrible amount. However, I should have bought the next size larger. This was just a nice fit before washing and drying. Actually wouldnt have hurt this sweatshirt to have been slightly larger to begin with. After it shrunk I gave it away. I am buying more of these! The material is very nice. I am ordering a larger size."
231474,0,"This does what it says for the most part, EXCEPT when it claims it filters 2.5 gallons in 15 minutes. Try 30+ minutes. I used clean water on my first go and it took 30+ minutes to filter it all. Perhaps it would take only 15 minutes if you have someone compressing the bag to squeeze the water through faster....which does speed things up. Doing the first two liter flush to get rid of the dust from the charcoal portion of the filter REQUIRED pressure, it acted as though it were totally clogged at first.If you need water in a hurry, bring your hand pump filter. (I like my MSR Sweetwater, it is awesome.) If you have time to kill, this works fine and is easier to fill a secondary bag with, which is what we ended up doing, we'd fill the bag, then let it slowly drain into a second bag which we would use as our source."
142207,2,"The watch face just looks like rainbows so you can't see a thing. I returned mine for this reason. Otherwise, it's fine."
289345,1,"These are the most comfortable earmuffs I have ever used. They are large enough for me (I have big ears :/), and the headband is snug while not being too tight. They are very bulky and goofy-looking compared to other models, but offer the best noise reduction. With other models like the Impact Sport, they don't fit snugly enough and thus don't block out enough sound. These are also more affordable at under $30. I'm pleased with them, they offer a high level of noise reduction and comfort for long-term use."
165445,1,"this knife is awesome. the blade is sturdy, hard metal, and sharp. it has a tooth pick, tweezers, nice blade, mini scissors, a flat head screw driver, and a nail file. I've had it for about 2 years the the only thing that looks different is the ruby red plastic is a little scratched. all in all its an amazing knife i really recommend it."
356797,0,"I'm a personal trainer and I love using these types of bands to help my clients ""activate"" their gluteal muscles, however the complain is the strain around the ankles. The padding is very thin and my clients, including myself, can feel the surgical tubing rubbing on the skin when performing the exercises. I suppose if the exercise is performed in smaller strides then perhaps it can be prevented, but then it defeats the purpose of resistance."
101263,0,"The quality of the gloves is fine. However, I found that the manufacturer is making the ""small"" size longer in the finger lenghts compared to previous pairs that I have purchased locally. It's probably best to be able to try on prior to purchasing."
359798,1,"You are never too old to keep haveing fun. My girlfriend and I like to take my dog out and play in the park. He loves to catch the frisbee but he doesnt always bring it back.This is the best and only really good frisbee I have ever owned. It has a really nice balance and a lot of bulk so you can get a lot of momentum, speed, and stability with it."
125939,0,"The Vector is a good watch for anyone with a sweet tooth for cool gadgets. It is a comfortable and capable watch, but for the price I would have to say I expected a little more. I have had my watch for about 3 weeks and have 2 negative thigs to say about it thus far. The first day I had the watch I somehow scratched the face IN THE POOL.....how that happened I have no idea, so I have been VERY careful to not let the watch touch anything, but I am afraid that as soon as I get used to it and start wearing it like I should it is going to take a beating and who knows how it will come out. Second, the altimeter is very shifty. I have to reset it about every third time I look at it. I have read the instruction book and have been doing everything as it states, but cannot get it to function properly. Being in the military (NAVY) I spend most of my time at sea level, so I check it every time I am significantly higher than sea level, and it is almost always wrong, WAY WRONG.The compass is nice and pretty accurate, thermometer is a little unreasonable (must take watch off for 15 minutes to get an accurate reading), and barometer is fairly accurate, but overall I had to go with a rating of 3.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A COOL LOOKING WATCH THAT HAS THE CAPABILITY OF DOING NEAT THINGS, THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE GOING TO DEPEND ON THE NEAT THINGS THAT THE WATCH IS SUPPOSED TO DO- I'D PASS."

333103,1,"Call me old-fashioned, but for sport belay and abseil/rappel, I prefer the Sticht plate. The plates are getting harder to find because everyone seemed to be jumping on the ATC bandwagon. Enter the SBGII. It does everything the Sticht plate does, everything the ATC does and still provides an added feature that allows it to serve as a Figure-8 as well. It is extremely versatile and doesn't matter if you're big or small, or if the person you are belaying is big or small; doesn't matter what size rope you are using, or if you're using two ropes. The SBG II handles them all! I've replaced 3 lbs of gear with a 4-oz SBG II."

385830,0,"In theory this is the best tactical folder on the planet. I used to own the old m-21 with a single flipper and loved it but lost it on a trip. I adore the design of this knife and only wish it came in a tool steel or higher carbon steel like ZDP-189.HOWEVER, the particular knife that was shipped to me had the tip-down pocket-clip screw holes drilled in the wrong position to accommodate a pocket-clip that is different than the one pictured - both here and on the CRKT website. The middle 1/16&#34; pocket-clip screw hole is drilled way too close to the top most 1/8&#34; venting hole making it obvious that this was a botched drilling job. The space between the two holes is thinner than a piece of aluminum foil. I'm still in debating on whether or not I want to go thru the bother of returning it over this mostly cosmetic defect, especially since i prefer tip-up carry anyhow. I think I probably won't return it, but this just bothers me."
480358,2,"I purchased this for my son for his birthday. It was fairly easy to assemble but a few weeks later, the edge of the backboard came unglued from the frame. A rain storm with strong winds took out 1/2 of the plexiglass. The rest fell out later in the season. I've inquired for a replacement backboard but it looks like it will be difficult to replace. This was a disappointment."
212623,1,"OK, let's start with the fact that I usually think that irons don't need covers. However, I recently got a set of Nike Slingshot OSS irons to help me with my game. These oversized irons feature a thin face with a deep cavity back. Suddenly, I felt like protecting that thin face that I'd invested in to help my game! So, I bought these covers.Overall, I like them a lot. They're well made, fit snugly, and are slightly padded so they offer good protection. Compared to other covers that I've seen others use, I like these better because they won't fall off while you're walking around and the tags make it very easy to pick the right iron. Some of the rubber/plastic covers have the iron number printed on them and that wears off over time making them hard to read. These covers also protect the hosel a bit too.My irons have about the largest oversized head I've seen so if they fit on mine they should fit on others. Be sure to get the right size for your irons. I also like the metalic color I got. It's a bit different than black or blue and doesn't show dirt.So, I think these are a great purchase. That said, I pretty much intend to use these for when my clubs are in the trunk. I'll probably take them off when I go out on the course. Still some old school left in me..."
65282,1,"I bought one for my grandson when he was 6 yrs old. He had already been using his friend's razor scooters since he was 3. This one was for my 5 yr old granddaughter who had been riding her brother's scooter. Of course, hers had to be pink. These are great scooters, compact for storage, and too cute. Of course, shin guards and helmets provide extra security. I highly recommend, with parental guidance, for children who are coordinated enough."
205629,2,"It might be better thatn the 1-star rating, but I just ran into the same problem as the previous reviewer. Item shipped quickly but was Treadmat instead of Treadsolid. Treadmat is apparently thinner and is sold for less on Amazon. It seems that the problem was due to a tracking label from the manufacturer to Amazon, which identifies the product as Treadsolid. But product label clearly shows that it is a Treadmat. Hopefully Amazon can clear up the problem before others have to go through the return process."
229996,2,Junk. First sizes are way small. Second fabric will tear the back or your legs apart. Spend the extra couple bucks and get the gel version.
17453,0,I bought these skates for my twins for basic and beginner ice skating. I do think they run true to size. They are high quality and are a good price. I do think they are very snug for a child that has a wide foot. I would not recommend these skates for someone with a wide foot at all. One of my twins has an average foot and they were a bit uncomfortable for her. The other twin has a wide foot and she was very uncomfortable in them. Fortunately we only had few lessons in these and then outgrew them in 2 months. The next skate we bought were Jackson skates which are much wider skates and were the same price.
70460,0,"I bought this for my self. I am slender 5'10 tall and 170LBS. I put it on and it looked like a woman's watch on my wrist.A beautiful watch, but I am used to fuller faces. I am keeping it and giving it to my 15 year old son as a Christmas gift.Great looking Product."

139014,0,"I purchased this item for my sister, who likes to have barbecue all the times. It is nicely designed. Hard to turn on and lit. Make sure to purchase the carrying deck. If not you have to come up with a solution to keep it elevated. It is much bigger and bulkier than it looks on the picture. Because it is very hard to clean, my sister used it only a couple of times."
351459,2,"I love the Mars 3.0 light, it's super bright, light, tough, and easy to clip.But the Quadrant is way to big, heavy, and cumbersome. I ride in NYC and there's no way I'm going to lug this around with me. Perhaps it's good for riding in the middle of nowhere or calling alien ships (because it is bright), but I ended up selling it and getting a small one.I would suggest not getting the combo. Get the Mars for sure, then something likePlanet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mounteven though the mount is a little finicky. It's just a better setup if you are like me and like not to be weighed down, or leave your lights attached."
232436,0,"Shirt is of very poor quality. There isn't much ribbing around neck and cuffs, and the shirt is quite long. I Probably wouldn't have spent $50 on it if it wasn't my girlfriends first show. Image appears to be good quality, but it just looks weird if you don't wear a second shirt underneath it."
56123,0,I got this to have at my desk during the work week to help stretch my legs and to keep me feeling less winter slug-like. The biggest problem I have is that despite the fact there is a tension twist-it provides no tension. Only get this if you desire no resistance. The assembly was very easy and it is small which is what I wanted BUT I wish it would push back more.
393722,1,"Length:: 1:16 MinsSo far, so good. I was a little upset that there weren't any video reviews for this product, (youtube, from the company itself etc.) so I promised myself that I'd make a video demonstration for others to judge.The basic stuff you need to know: There are 12 levels of resistance (I was using resistance level 8).The computer tells you how many complete rows you have performed, time performed, calories burned or you can scan through all three (My computer didn't work when it first arrived, but after a solid punch it woke up and started working). The resistance is nice. You'll get a good workout with this inexpensive machine. Storage is convenient, but don't be fooled, 35 pounds is heavy to move around from room to room. Keep the machine close to where you plan on using it. Finally, the footstraps were a major complaint. My complaint about the footstraps is that it doesn't hold your feet securely against the footrests. The clicking noise you hear in the video (at the end of each rep) is my heel clicking against the footrest. The footrest issue is not as bad as others have made it seem (in my opinion), although strapping the footstraps on properly isn't an easy task."

4780,0,"My son is in Cubs Scouts and I recently had to start stocking up on gear. I was spending a lot of money and wanted to save some here and there by getting this basic mat. For what it does it does well, but comfort is not high on it's list. They are thin and light, but if you have the money and are not worried about weight, buy a self-inflating mat. IF you are a backpacker and want to minimize the weight and sacrifice some comfort...this is definitly a great buy. Why the 3 stars, I am not looking at the weight factor yet."

408893,1,"I find it easier to place my 552 dumbbells back having them raised on this stand vice sitting on the ground. The stand looks good and is well constructed. I didn't have problems with assembly, it goes much quicker if you have your own tools (Ratchet/Alan Wrench) and the instructions are straight forward. It took about 30 minutes start to finish, luckily I didn't have the hole alignment issues others have posted. I'm not sure but previous users may have had trouble if they tightened down all the hardware before everything was assembled, the directions state when to torque down the bolts. If you've ever put any home furniture together you should have no problem. I still worry a little about the durability of the dumbbells, but have no doubt that the stand will last a long time."

491628,0,"The description on this helmet says it is for 8 - 14 years. However, upon arrival, it is a 5+ years helmet and really too small for my 9 year old son. The inside of the helmet has velcro and it comes with two sets of foam inserts you can use to adjust the size. One set is thick to make the helmet smaller to fit a younger child and one thinner set to fit an older child. Either set of inserts makes this helmet too tight for my average size 9 year old. Nonetheless, he likes the helmet and refused to return it. He is able to wear it without either set of inserts, but sometimes complains that the velcro hurts his head."
504337,0,"the goal itself is quite unwieldy. don't think this is going to store away nicely in a corner. it's basically a bunch of PVC pipes. to ""collapse"" the goal, you must pul them apart, except it's just as likely as not that it's going to come apart in the wrong place when you give it a pull. when you eventually get it apart, it doesn't sit well, rather, it's falling all over the place. the manual shows it sitting on what looks like a custom built rack.the sticks are fine for street hockey / kids."
289790,1,"I love this jacket! It's very comfortable, light weight, and fits nicely to a women's body. The hood has a very small extended visor that works great for keeping the rain off the face. It will keep you warm when layered with sweaters and such because it keeps the cold air out. The armpit vents come in handy when ventilation is needed. I highly recommend this jacket."
404284,0,"Ordered this thinking it was a set, because the picture of each size shows a set, yet it was not. Can't return it because the papers that came in the box were shredded and messy, return label was already removed from the sheet, not that I could be bothered to return it. The box it came in was smashed in. The dumbbell itself is good, and will serve its purpose. Will have to order another dumbbell because it was not a set, but will NOT order it from Amazon.com"

There were other The Original Health Club Step, 2 Blocks, that did not have a picture of the Health Club Step. Hence, I knew that these were not what I was looking for. Please be more descriptive if you choose to take a picture of WHAT you will NOT be sending, as that is inappropriate.

117400,0,"The box was packaged well, however when I opened it up I noticed some light scratch marks on the inside of the box, and one of the hinge pins was missing. Also, inside the box, on the bottom tray, It looked like someone had dug into the hard plastic chip holder. Needless to say, I expected a little more quality than that. However, once I fixed the hinge and put all the chips inside (btw, chips are very high quality), it wasn't as big of a deal."
282052,1,I'm satisfied with my purchase. Some people complained about the smell but I dont really smell anything. The thickness is great. It's quite comfortable. I just wish that it was wider.

Yet, I feel cramped under this umbrella, and when I walk it rains on my feet. If I hold the umbrella out in front of me to protect my shoes then my back gets wet. Ugh. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE GustBuster.. make a compact 50ish inch version! The 60ish inch versions are too large for me. As other have said, the build quality is mediocre. What you would expect of something made in China. I do not expect it to last. I would have gladly paid $20 more for a higher build quality. I find it a bit cumbersome to close and fasten when compared to my plain old umbrella. That all said, the wind technology really does work. If you're tired of being blown around, then this is the umbrella to get. Let's just keep our fingers crossed and hope GustBuster makes some needed fixes to the next version.

I preferred the old-style cleats without the extra plastic to make for easier walking, especially since the forward cleat was metal. In this version, the forward cleat is plastic, and since my old cleats had worn quite a bit on the front, I'd gotten use to a looser connection for easier clipping in or out.

Once when I woke up, my fiance's feet were wet and freezing because they had been up against the tent wall. There was dew all over the outside of the tent and every time we moved, some shook down on our faces!! I'm not talking damp, but the walls were saturated. Also, it made me nervous changing in there because i could see people through the mesh. It was just big enough to fit a queen size air mattress, but not much else. I have no idea how 3 or 4 people could fit in this. The zippers worked really well though, and the height wasn't bad, even with a double sized air mattress."
232135,0,I like these leggings but I can't say they're as nice as I hoped. They're thin and I personally like them a little heavier weight. I feel they fit a bit better on the heavier side. I do find that they slide down and I'm forever pulling them up.
303077,1,"If you really put the effort into this, you are going to see results. Maybe not as great as those shown on the photos, but it will happen. And get ready to sweat alot. This is a workout only for those in so-so shape to start with. I'm only into week 6 of this and I've already lost 15 lbs (I started at 200 - @ 5'10"") and the muscles are starting to show. Best part of the workouts is the enthusiasm of Tony Horton. He keeps pushing you, and that really helps to keep you motivated. Already I can do 5 chin ups, I never could do one before. My only warning is that this is not a magic pill, you will be tired, you may hate it at times, but if you really put the effort in it will make a huge difference."
400094,1,"After several annoying flats with my Trek 7.5FX and 1.5 Road Bike I decided to find a tube that could handle the occasional puncture. The Slime Tubes work perfectly. Since I have installed these tubes in both tires on both bikes I have not had a ride stopping flat since. I have had two punctured which were rapidly sealed by the green slime. I was able to add back the pressure with my portable pump and continue my rides. I have still not changed the tubes. The slime made a perfectly acceptable seal and has not leaked since. Even when I did get a puncture, if I didn't have a pump I could have still rode home, it just would have been a careful ride to make sure I didn't damage the rim as a result of low tire pressure (60-70 psi). These are the only tubes I will buy from now on."
314907,0,The watch is convenient if you are looking for something to track your heart rate while working out. I do not know how acurate it is. I think it can do more than what I think it can - I have not had time to read the instructions to program it. The light feature is bad - when you press the light button you can not see the numbers. Other than that - if you are looking for something simple - this will work. Best of Luck in your search.

The weight on these gloves is on the back of my hands. And I do not find it very comfortable to wear when I go running (as I usually wear weighted gloves during a run to increase calorie-burn), since I cannot bend my hand into a fist very well with the weights starting at the back of my hand leading to my wrist. Either way, it was still a good value...less expensive than the Beachbody gloves and a little heavier, which was what I was going for in the first place."

470045,0,"I believe I would have really liked this product, if only it had arrived undamaged. The box the ellliptical came in had water stains and looked banged and dented in a couple of spots. After I had it put together and gave it a try, rust started falling from inside the pedal assembly onto the tracks (rail assembly). After a while this stopped, but the tracks now have permanent rust marks on them. Another problem was that one of the plastic crank covers arrived broken. Both of these problems, appear to be due to less than careful handling during product shipping.The only other problem was that after putting it together, I found I had two cylindrical parts left over. After a few days, the elliptical started making a very loud thumping noise. After figuring out exactly how the noise was being made, I realized that these parts should be used where the lower handlebar assembly connected to the sub pedal arm assembly. I looked back through the directions and there was no mention of these parts or where they belonged."
268795,0,"as most here have said, it is a cheaper bike and that is what you should expect.Mine came beat up too, box was full of holes and the bike was full of scratches but overall nothing more than cosmetic. It only took about 1/2 hour to assemble, but it took another 2 hours to get the shifting to work, and to align and true the wheels. I am not a bike guy but it was pretty easy to adjust the shifting and tweak the spokes to get the wheels straighter. If I had paid full price, I wouldn't have been happy, but for the $60 Black Friday deal, I can live with it."
506606,1,"Kelly Coffey-Meyer is a high-energy instructor who offers fun workouts which blend more traditional exercises with unique, interesting twists. NYC is a 54-minute full body strength workout which uses two sets of dumbbells (light and heavy) plus an optional step; Kelly works out in a bright studio with two background exercisers. For the most part, the workout follows a specific pattern: Kelly targets a single upper body muscle group with several exercises using weights, moves on to an unweighted lower body interval, repeats a second set of the upper body moves, and concludes the series with slightly different lower body exercise. Overall, Kelly moves very quickly through the workout--the lower body exercises in particular are performed quickly enough to keep your heart rate in an aerobic zone.Kelly begins with a 4-minute warm-up that includes basic aerobic moves and ends with dynamic stretches. The first muscle group is back, and Kelly begins with traditional 1-arm rows. More unique are the alternating shoulder blade pulls (palm up, thumb moves to the back) and the back raises with slow lowers. For lower body, Kelly does a side squat and rear lunge off the step; after repeating the back work, she does just the rear lunge, moving into a double-time count. The next exercise group biceps, starting with hammer curls that lower to the side. Kelly then does half bicep curls high and low, adding a 1-arm move to both. The leg series is a side step with a curtsey dip, adding a knee raise to work the obliques. The biceps are repeated, and then it's a side-to-side step with a rear lunge.Moving to lighter dumbbells, Kelly starts the shoulder work, beginning with a circling lift overhead. She then combines shrugs with an upright row and finishes with a butterfly elbow lift and overhead press. The leg move is a wide squat with a knee lift to the side and then the back; after another set of shoulders, the leg move changes slightly to an around the world leg lift with rear lung. Next comes triceps: French press, elbow touches, and dips with pulses. Then, straddling the step, you do a plie squat, this time keeping the weights in your hand; to finish, you repeat the triceps and then perform the plie squat with the opposite leg forward. Kelly conclude the standing work with an additional move for the legs, a bent-over squat with hands on the step.The workout then moves to the floor (lying on the step/bench) for chest work, which includes pullovers, wide grip bench presses, flyes, and close grip bench presses. Kelly then does a series of abs work with basic crunches before repeating the chest moves. She finishes this series by moving the dumbbells to hips for pelvic raises to target the glutes/hamstrings. She then moves to the floor for additional abs work. These moves were more Pilates-like and thus more challenging: Kelly starts with a 4-count crunch but then does knee tuck-ins (adding rotation), roll-ups, and half roll-downs with a twist on the end. Moving to side-lying position, she does a short but tough series of hip/outer thigh work on both sides, then repeats the floor abs series. Finally, Kelly concludes the workout with a very short (about 3 minutes) stretch on the floor, first lying for the lower body and then seated for the upper body.The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options: Introduction, Start Workout, Workout Options, Coffey Mixes, and Credits. The Workout Options is basically a chapter list (Warm-up, Standing Exercises, Chest to Lower Ab's [sic], Chest to Glutes, Abdominals to Outer Thighs, More Ab's [sic] and Stretch). The Coffey Mixes menu offers several shorter premix options:Expresso Mix (no warm-up, 1 set of all exercises, stretch)Latte Mix (warm-up, 1 set of all exercises, stretch)Mocha Mix (warm-up, upper body, abs, stretch)Capucchino (warm-up, all legs, abs, stretch)Overall, I enjoyed this workout very much. I did have a few minor issues with it--eg, I thought that the triceps were overworked, and I didn't like the first abs series of basic crunches--but in general, I found the moves enjoyable, and I felt thoroughly worked out by the end. Kelly is a fun yet no-nonsense instructor; I give this workout a final rating of 4 1/2 stars, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, especially for intermediate-level exercisers."
193416,0,"I got this watch several years ago. It loses a few seconds/day, which I can live with. But the band is too big (I'm 6', 185#). I took it to the jeweler but he said you can't remove links. So it's been a constant annoyance -- I have to put it high up on my arm and it continually slips down, especially when the weather is dry. Someone else commented that the buttons get pushed in normal wear -- this is also true, but the issue with the band is a much more constant annoyance.PS: This is a friend's account -- she is _not_ 6' 185#."

433013,0,"I bought these gloves because I started working out at the gym and needed added protection to my hands, since I have carpal tunnel. These gloves protect my palms from the pressure and I have less pain in my hands. I wish the fit was tighter around the fingers, but ince I wear rings, the fit works out so I don't have to take my rings off; and I'm now wondering if I should got a glove to fit up around my wrist for added support. My hands are med-large and I have long skinny fingers, so the fit isn't custom made, but for now they're working out for my workout routine."
86558,0,"After reading all of the great reviews about how sturdy and rugged it was I took a chance it would be OK for benching in the rack. No complaint with the manufacturer because they stated 300 lb. limit. Apparently non of the reviewers have a big bench press. The pad feels great. Ideal width and firm pad. But the frame will not take heavy weight. We had just done 625 for a 2 board press and were very lucky when I was about to take 675 out that one side spotter noticed the leg bent inwards about 10-15 degrees. Quite sure the 675 would have finished it and me off. Like I said, based on all the reviews I decided to 'check it out' and almost paid dearly. I'm going to get the legs welded at the seams so it's a solid bench and use it for DB work, so it's not a wast (price is great). I'd recommend it as a DB work bench. But if you and the bar weigh more than 300, don't risk it. Respect the recommended limit and it's a good comfortable and affordable light work bench."

70684,0,"One of the selling points (for me) was that the bag is waterproof. It seems that the fabric is, but there's no zipper or anything to seal it tightly. In principle, water could flow into the open holes on the two ends of the bag (near the straps), though the weight of the bag's contents tends to close it tight in practice. The computer and inner pouch are safely protected from falling water by being in the center of the main flap, but the main compartment might just fill up with water in a heavy downpour.There's no lack of pockets within pockets on the inside, but I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't have (unprotected) pockets on the outside, where I like to put ID badges for easy retrieval.Also, a buyer should know that while the main flap can be closed with clips (as seen in the picture), there's also a lot of velcro holding it down. I haven't decided whether this is a good thing or not--- velcro has a limited lifetime and can be loud to open in meetings, but it does make the flap want to stay down, so I don't need to bother clipping it all the time. If I decide to remove the velcro, I'll need to do it with a seam-ripper.The way that it changes shape under weight (closing the open holes near the straps like parted lips) also makes it difficult to retrieve things while wearing it, which is one of the things I liked about messenger bags (like purses with laptops in them)."
166239,0,"Great concept to have a bed inside a frame. This happened to be my favorite part because the sheets stayed on perfectly. But the frame made this bed very large, so unless you have a large room with close to nothing in it, it'll be a challenge to put somewhere. Wasn't too comfortable either. We purchased this as a temporary replacement for our old mattress while we were waiting for our new one. Slept on it for 2 days and my husband and I just tossed and turned like crazy. Had my dad sleep on it a few weeks ago, but he didn't complain. It is a lot more comfortable with just one person on it, but then, what's the purpose of a queen size bed if only one person is comfortable sleeping on it?"

51821,2,"Every year for the past 3 or 4 years me and my brother have played an NCAA dynasty where we play on the same team, set the level to heisman, pick a horrible team (to make it a challenge), and run nothing but option no matter what the scenario is (4th and 30.....still run the option). Then we save and export our draft classes to Madden until our roster is full of NCAA players we recruited and we ultimately win championships in both games with the same players. Well, this years NCAA does not allow people to play on the same team, so ultimately this tradition is ruined!!!!! Not only did NCAA ruin the college game, but this is going to ruin Madden as well.

489129,0,"I like this cutter and lockstud and if you are planning on doing small batches (50-150 shells) it is pretty good. The fact is however turning the lockstud is brutal on the hands after about 150 shells. It is really unpleasant, the knurled steel grip is like a flesh grinder and the amount of repetative force required is just bad for the hands. I had to give up using this forever because of how badly it would aggrivate my joints and I have no other issues or joint problems I just re-load allot for a .223. I gave this three stars though because it really works well if you are carfull how long you use it and how many shells you do. There are other brands but in all honesty for the money this is a great deal if you want to use a mechanical shell cutter. I have found a manual cutter such as offered by Hornady to be easier on the hands even though it is slower (not by much though because of shell change times)."

274029,0,"First off I'd like to start off this review by saying that like a lot of people have mentioned, the material is super thin. If you take a single layer up to the light you can see the specks of light through it. The collar portion seems to be a double layer though, and the vest itself is decently warm AS A LAYER. By itself, wind will cut right through the thin material and leave you cold. The vest does work well as a thin, insulating layer under a soft shell or windbreaker. The double thickness collar is nice because when you zip up the vest all the way it does keep your neck warm. I would have preferred if the entire vest was the same thickness as the collar though.For the Amazon price, it's not terrible. I'd probably pay a little more and get a Polartec fleece material vest though. Definitely not worth the $40 sticker price that was on the label. But if you plan to just use this vest as an internal layer then it's decent for the $25 price tag."
305448,0,"I bought this to wear for my early morning walks. It does a good job, but the vest is definitely made for much thinner people than me. The strap that goes around the waist rides up my rib cage. The zipper pocket on the front of the vest would be more useful if it were a little deeper."
200076,1,"I'm very happy with these gloves -- sort of -- which I've been using for about three years. I had problems with BOTH of the initial gloves I got -- the seams opened up. I sent them back and they sent replacements -- no questions asked. Then the seams opened up again on the second pair. The third pair is still going strong after two years of use (I also have a fourth pair in reserve).I'm going to keep sending them back (and hopefully keep getting replacements) as necessary.I like them because they provide some warmth, but primarily because they provide grip (even after slathering yourself with sunscreen) and they prevent me from getting blisters while paddling my kayak. However, I find that I still need to put some athletic tape on my hands under the glove.Note that I even wear these in the summer. The thin insulation isn't outrageously hot under summer paddling conditions.I'm giving it four stars out of five because until the seams give out, this glove is great. An obvious way that they could improve is by having more durable seams. They may have nailed this finally because, as I said above, the third pair has now lasted two years and counting."

297318,0,"This is an attractive watch, and not being an attractive man - I've had more compliments than usual with this baby strapped on my left wrist. That being said, the tightness on the fourth eye, and the looseness on the 5 eye forces me to make a decision every morning. I say to myself, &#34;Self, is it a 4 or 5 eye day?&#34; This leaves me wanting and intermediate eye.The time piece keeps time well. You know, 60 seconds for every minute, and 60 minutes for each hour... an so on. What you would come to expect from a watch, I suppose. The 3 tiny watches inside look nice, but ill be honest, I don't know what use they would serve a business man like me.The only thing I question is the quality of the strap. I have been wearing this watch for 2 weeks when the secondary strap that holds the excess overlap of the band fast to the other band, snapped loose. Upon inspection, it seems to be loosely held by glue. Anyway, it is still fully functional.

I pulled one patch through without problem but when I tried to use a second patch it got seriously stuck. I tried multiple ideas to get it out but finally called the OTIS customer service line. Their rep was helpful and even called me back to see how the solution worked. But my gun was ""down"" for four hours or so while I wrestled with the stuck patch issue. To make this kit really useful for ""Snipers"" as it is titled, they need a longer flexible rod, smaller diameter patches, and a list of 'do's and don'ts' to avoid a repeat of the stuck patch issue. By the way, look on line and you will see that many others have had this exact problem.Otherwise it is a good idea, but right now I am more confident using a bore snake."

The rubber grip on the palms helped me get through some of the more difficult obsticles without tearing my hands up and they stood up to the beating. There was no keeping my hands dry, as we were continually in and out of the water but i knew that going in. I would reccomend these to anyone who is running a OCR.

115818,1,"I searched so long and so hard for the perfect yoga mat.I wanted a totally eco friendly mat, but I could NOT get over the smell. I put it in front of the fan and left it there for days. No good. It still smelled bad enough that I was avoiding it. Not great for your practice. Also the texture on some of the eco mats just gave me goosebumps when I touched it.So I got this one.Eco:It should last forever. They say so (I know;I know). As slightly more relevant evidence, it looks exactly as it did the day I bought it - about a year ago- and I practice every day.Smell:It doesn't smell funny. Yea!Touch:Lovely. It is the perfect grippiness as in I don't slide and it does not feel like it is made out of taffy (ugh to the Tapas mat and all those Gaiam and Hugger Mugger cheapies).Color:Everyone RAVES about the Maduka PRO, but honestly I can't spend that much time with the color black. This is a slightly lighter version and it comes in better colors. I have it in moss. It is a soothing color. It's not too bright and not too drab.Weight:Yes, it *is* heavy, but not that heavy. I certainly won't travel with it - what WILL I travel with??!!- but for class and back it does fit in my old mat bag just fine.It is sturdy. I don't need extra padding for my knees. It is firm enough that I don't wobble out of balance poses.All in all I finally shelled out for the best of the best and I am totally over-the-moon thrilled and completely in love with it."

20240,0,"First of all, I must say I'm impressed with Amazon's customer service. Told me I would have it in 2 days and then they ran out until July. I called to complain and they were very helpful, although they couldn't do much. I didn't expect it before our trip, made plans to borrow someone else's tent, and it showed up before my vacation. Seems like they really went out of their way to help. I was very impressed.The tent has it's good points and not so good points. I agree that the directions stink, yet I could figure it out right as it was starting to rain and didn't have much time. It rained the minute we got it up and it held up quite well. No leaks. I would imagine that if it rained sideways, the jury would still be out.One tent pole broke. The rope snapped inside of it. I will send for another. I hope I don't run into problems since I don't have a traditional receipt and I got this through Amazon.The actual fit of the tent was not the best. So tight in some areas that I thought the seams would rip. Other parts were loose. Seems like it was really stressed after we put the side poles on. Inside window poles were so tight that I thought I would rip the tent to get them in the right holes. Part of the inside door was so tight that I couldn't zip it shut all the way. It could have been from being our first time putting it up. Hopefully it will come together better the next time we use it. If not, I would consider returning it.Overall very spacious (Our friends asked where the second floor was). Great ventilation. We slept 7 adult and one kid very comfortably. The zipper on the inside of the door glowed in the dark, which came in very handy. The shelves and cup holders are cool yet they are not in the ballpark of a Jeep tent that we used last summer that was off the charts of being a great tent. If I ever find one of those to buy, I'm buying it.The bottom line is that this seems to be a good family tent that you have to get to know it's little quirks (like the door seam switching from inside to outside so the zipper gets caught if you don't pay attention). It did fit back into the case very easily, after we figured out how to fold it the right size of the bag.It just might take some practice to ease into really loving this tent. I hope the seams don't keep stretching and that it goes up more uniformly next time. If that happens, it's a keeper, and I would rate it higher than 3 stars."

The hawk is well made - no complaints there - but I find myself choking up on the handle for much of my time with it. It tries to be 100% ax, 100% hammer... and is. But the cost is weight, which for me is excessive. I also have a Trail Hawk, which I can swing forever and, although it doesn't chop quite as fast as this, the difference is not so great as to make it a problem. The Norse Hawk (i also own one of those) is also an equivalent chopper and doesn't fatigue me like this one."
137992,1,"Compliments any Ruger firearm. I would highly recommend this to any one. Made in the USA also for those interested. For only a few dollars more that a cheap generic case this was a deal in my opinion. The only downside, is that it has no pockets for extra/separate storage of magazines, but I knew that before purchasing. It is big enough to fit two (possibly up to four if you crammed them in there) spare magazines with a standard Ruger Mark 1. The padding seems fairly ""heavy"" and thick also, when compared to cheap bargain bin soft cases I have. Overall 4.5 stars."

We both wear them when we ride our Harley. With all that wind the fabrics has held up great. I just wished the waterproof layer did as well. If you are very active your water barrier might also fail.

195776,0,"Okay, so I paid $25 three years ago for this catalytic heater. It worked great for two seasons, keeping my boat warm even when temperatures dipped to below freezing. In my salon/galley, I placed the heater under the dinette and the heat rising to waist height was perfection indeed. The whole cabin/pilothouse did get and stay warm. And I'm vintage, so by warm I mean comfortable with just a long-sleeved shirt on; I do not wear sweaters or sweat shirts inside, as I'm too old for that nonsense.Anyway, this year (#3) I again pulled out my trusted heater and inserted a new propane tank into the very stable base. Incidentally, the feet don't even have to be opened for stability on my boat though if yours rocks more you'll want to open the legs out. They fold under the unit, so storage is very small.BUT, back to my story. This year when I lit the unit it would not stay lit. Yes, I was careful to light the entire top, but nothing I did would make the unit stay lit. I did take it apart but wasn't able to find or fix the issue.So, for two years I sang it's praises (and indeed at $25 it was a good bargain) though now, when I come back to buy another at almost $50? Well, I've decided to to spend the money. Heading for the equator (at least until I warm up) seems a better alternative.Would I buy this again? Maybe, if there was no alternative to staying warm (and truly, having read over the review for similar items, this one is TOPS!) but instead, we are going south. I'll make do for a bit. Would I suggest you buy this item? Yes, with the suggestion that at the beginning of each season you verify that it works properly.Mine (this product) burns for 14 hours on one canister of fuel and kept the pilothouse/galley warm. Good product, BUT..... :)"

199282,0,"UPDATE:After about 50Km, the sensor (the thing that attach to the front fork) died on me. I do not know if the problem is due to a broken wireor the sensor circuitry. I computer is still functioning but it can fall off the handle bar when you ride into a pot hole. I had totape it to the handle bar. Also it does not handle the rain well. It can temporary lose connection in the rain.-----------------------------------------------------PREVIOUS UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------------------------For the price, this bike computer is very good. It has many functions and once you understand how to operated, it is very nice.The one thing that realy ruining this product rating is the badly badly written instruction manual. It took me a while to installthis not because it is complicated but because the instruction is so bad. Basicaly the main thing to keep in mind is you must placethe magnet near the bottom of the sensor and not at the center. In regard to the operation instruction? forget it!, some of theinformation need to be updated and the pictures of each of the display mode are not even correct. For example in the Quick Set-upaccording to the instruction, you suppose to provide your age and weight in step 4 and 5. However the bike computer does not actualyask you that information at all. Instead step 4 and 5 were replaced be a single step that ask you for something that I have no ideawhat. All I could tell is that it has two numbers one represent the speed (of what I don't know) the other is a 3-digit number forwhat I have not clue. I just skip this step. My guess is that this info is used to figure out your Calorie and Fat burning. Ifyou don't need that then you are OK. If this information is important to you, you might want to read all the review in here to seeif anyone has figured out how to get that to work. One other thing is that they give you a handfull of plastic quick tie it toyour bike -- that's how you install this thing on your bike.. Its kind of lame but it works. what this means is that you can onlyinstall it once because the plastic ties are only for one time use. And if you don't know how to install this and used up allthe plastic ties then you are out of luck. Actually I discovered that you can buy these plastic quick ties at Home Depot very cheap.Might be a good idea.Other than that I realy like this bike computer. When it works, it work wells. By the way, when you install the cell battery, don'tclose the cover too tight, it might get stuck in the battery compartment."

373668,2,"I recently purchased this light so that I could grill in the dark winter evenings, blindly based on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen. It is probably the worst gadget I've ever used, and have no idea why they chose it.I suppose it was probably due to the extra long adjustable neck, or bright light, but the mounting hardware is all but useless. The C-clamp has two flat surfaces with no undercuts, making it worthless for clamping to any surface that isn't uniformly thick, such as the stainless-steel shelves on my grill that have a 1/4"" bend edge for rigidity.I finally did find a second-rate place to mount it, but then found other major flaws. The light is meant to be removable from the C-clamp, but the connection is very difficult. And worst of all, there are mating serrated washers that are supposed to allow the light to pivot in relation to the base, but the plastic material cannot support the weight of the head, and was stripped out the first time I used it. So now the light won't stay in any upright position.I hope to rig up an alternate method when it gets warmer and salvage my overpriced investment. LED lights have become more common lately, I'm sure there are better products out there than this one."

Numbers on the display are large and easily readable. Buttons are large, and occasionally I hit them accidentally. Battery life is good. Resistance to water seems at least average. I got my first BC906 at my local bike shop and they'd quit carrying it, so I ordered online, ordered from Amazon, it came from Nashbar.I didn't want cadence. My main desire was current speed, odometer (trip and total) and current time. This unit does all those functions quite well. Four stars for good value and price, a deduction for a bit too easy to knock off the bike, and a set up procedure that always sends me online to find the manual -- nonintuitive. For $15, I'm pleased."

It works wonderfully and I was surprised at the ease of the exercise and the type of workout it provided. Surprisingly, I really feel like it is a good workout. It's also fun to use along with music. I was disappointed in the pump which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I actually used an electric pump with mine so it wasn't an issue. If you are not very good at exercising, and not sure where to start, this is a great tool to get you started. I'm happy to say it's working for me. The ball also looked very much like the one pictured."
97479,1,"Ditto to all the other positive reviews - would just like to add that it has fine balance of weight and substantiality combined with a warm helios face that gives the impression of substance and delicacy of the hands. A super nice watch for the price. Of course there are nice Omegas and Citizens and such, but not for this aesthetic and price. Also would add some strong positive words for Casio service. The analog hands of the watch started running slow since last winter, just got too busy and flustered to look for repair. I finally found the Casio online repair website (where you fill in the details and then it processes a repair ticket, then you send in the watch with proof of purchase receipt - fortunately I got it from Amazon, and just went to my old orders and printed it out - this is just a few days short of a year later after purchase !) I mailed the watch to them (Priority Mail) on Monday, and on Friday I received new replacement. Kuddos to Casio Service - highly, highly recommend. And will certainly make me consider another Casio purchase. Cheers !"

418346,0,"First thing happened, when I took the carafe apart to wash it, I cut my finger on the ridiculously sharp edge of the outer mantle. Then I spent literally hours to get the Thermos sticker off without scratching the stainless steel. After a call to Thermos customer service, I followed their suggestion using oil and rubbing alcohol, to no avail. Then I decided to soak it in lukewarm water. It helped some. When I finally got the band of paper off, I discovered that the inner threaded plastic ring had come lose. I couldn't screw the top back on until I glued the ring back in with gorilla glue. I wrote to Thermos suggesting they tell their Chinese manufacturer to dull the sharp edge of the mantle and to use different glue. Surprise, I did not get the courtesy of an answer. Upside: My finger healed and the carafe does a reasonably good job keeping my coffee hot. I knew from experience with my old carafe that I had to point the top to the back in order to close it. To deal with the piercing screech I found it helpful to push the lever a couple of times right after filling the carafe. Would I buy the same carafe again? Most likely not. In view of all the preliminary trouble my rating may be somewhat charitable."

Luckily my husband is a mechanic so we didn't have to send the whole machine back, just get a new part. He had to jump through a few hoops to order a replacement part and it took a while to get. So we had it nearly a month before anyone could use the machine. It's now fixed and operating as expected. If no more mechanical problems arise i'll say it's a good machine for the money."
474036,0,"**another update**I just threw this product in the trash. The leaking kept getting on my clothes even just for car use--because it leaks where the top screws on (below where you'd drink from). So as I'd take a drink of coffee and wind up wearing some. This has turned out to be one of the worst products I've bought in quite some time. I imagine it may work OK for some but there's no rubber stoppers or anything--apparently the quality control isn't up to ensuring the tolerances/lack of room for error this product provides.Go instead with the OXO Good Grips Click & Seal Travel Mug. That item is totally leakproof and actually holds a couple ounces more as well and has about the same size base so fits in the same cupholder the Nissan did.** previous review **I wrote this review initially praising the quality of this item and waxing poetic about how well this keeps stuff cold/hot. And it does do that very well.But mine I've found is not *totally* leakproof. Mine leaks a little from the top (significantly if you tap the side of it near the top)--so as one reviewer mentioned having this in a briefcase or purse--I don't think this would work for that AT ALL. Your papers, etc., would be wet. If this sits upright in a cupholder all the time you'll have no problem. But I can't lay mine sideways and let it roll all over without fear of it leaking like I thought I would be able to. Unfortunately I learned the hard way and had to clean up vanilla latte off the seats of my car.Also, it's important to be aware how small this is. I bought this size because I drive a european car that has a very small cupholder--something narrow and not-so-tall was a must. For this, this actually fits in the tiny cupholder and works perfectly.On the other hand, I didn't really stop to consider before ordering that 11oz really isn't a lot of useable space. If you happen to want a cold drink in here and put ice cubes in this you may have 7-8 oz of real drink room left. If you're using the tea strainer, that also takes up space internally as well--so in that configuration I doubt you'd be able to get an actual 11oz in here (as with the ice cubes). So this really is pretty small.So this is (as advertised, actually) best suited for those that want a single, *small* cup of hot coffee and that's it. As they call this a ""Coffee and Tea Traveler"" I can't fault them for the small size--I just don't think I was really understanding how little room there would be in here."
159033,0,"I bought 10 different color pair of these gloves. I love all the fun colors, but the gloves showed significant wear after only one time. They looked worse and showed more wear than gloves I've worn for months. The gloves appear to be very thin or weak material. Too bad because I love the fit and the color choices."
62212,1,"This bottle is very good, but the nature of its design makes me feel the need to fully clean it after each use, which can be a pain. For instance, I'm coming from a Sigg bottle, which just had a simple opening at the top with a screw-on cap. With that, I felt I could just run the bottle under hot water after each use during the week, and then give it a good clean with the scrubbing brushes once per week. There wasn't a lot of ""moving parts"".This bottle has a lot of moving parts, and I feel like I need to break it down every night, fully clean it, and then let it dry out. It's not a huge pain or anything, takes about 5 minutes to clean, but it definitely is more high maintenance than your typical water bottle.I have to admit I was skeptical about how the straw system would work before I got it, but based on other reviews I felt comfortable it would work. And it does. The straw system is great, and gives you a nice stream of liquid. The business end of the straw with the bite valve is a lot more durable than I had expected it would be, and it should last a good while before needing to be replaced.Overall, I'm impressed by the quality for the price I paid (around $10). If I had seen this bottle in an outdoors store, I wouldn't have batted an eye if the price tag had said $29.95. Rarely these days are you surprised with better quality than what you expected for what you pay, but this is a good example here. Will definitely order more as needed in the future."

84396,1,"This watch is an excellent heart rate monitor watch if you don't like wearing a strap across your chest. It's especially useful when you just want to check your heart rate throughout the day or after a short unexpected exercise or brisk walk without planning.Sometimes it detects a heart rate really quickly, however sometimes you'll sit there pushing the two buttons down and it'll feel like its never going to read your heart rate. Often it doesn't seem to read my heart rate if I'm still jumping around so you'll have to pause and stand there to get a heart rate reading.Otherwise, very comfortable to wear, its a little thick but I think most HR monitor watches are too.Battery replacement is CR2023 that you can find at the dollar store.

41348,0,"This bike is wonderful. I love the fact that you can stear it. But, paying more for the bike with the canopy is just a waist of money. I didn't believe the other reviews, but they were right. It sounds nice but it doesn't really do any good and I couldn't see him on the bike when it was up so i left the shade down most of the time. Great bike but I would get the cheaper one without the shade. It'll save you about 20 bucks."
62856,2,"These breeches were NOT cotton. They were a polyester/spandex blend, so I returned them. If polyester works in your climate, they were very nice breeches, but in 110+ heat, poly is a no-no. The seller said they would fix the link to the product description, and they may have, but be aware."

60686,0,"I got the knack of balancing on this quickly so I need some more serious exercises to get a core workout from this. I was hoping the bottom would be completely unstable so anytime you wanted to stand on it, you'd have to use your core to balance.I have tried to do pushups on it (as shown on the picture) but it is too narrow for my shoulders - and I am a medium size female, so I doubt it will work at all for male figures.I guess getting this with a workbook would be OK but I am less than thrilled for this especially given that it is not too cheap."
137370,1,"Had a chance to test this knife out during vehicle extrication training. The most impressive part of this knife is certainly the seat belt cutter. This sliced through the belts like butter, far better than the standalone seat belt cutters we had. I gave some tempered glass a few shots in the upper corner of the window, and it wouldn't shatter it. However, on the first try in the lower corner (this is where more people say to do it) it did shatter the glass. Used the serrated blade to saw through the wire harnesses with 15+ wires on the doors. It wasn't as quick as it could have been, but it certainly got the job done. Overall, I'm very impressed with the knife. Good buy."
157472,0,"I have always wanted this skirt and waited and waited until it was available and when it finally was I was in heaven! In my house. When I actually go for a run, the under compression short slips up my thighs. I have found this a problem with new balance in general, even thier running shorts do this on me. I thought I may have the wrong size. I wear 8 pants and 6 skirts, but I checked the retailer's sizing guide and it guided me to size M. I don't have a small bottom....... I usually run about 5 miles and I must stop at least 3 times to adjust. That being said I love the way I look in it and feel so feminine. It's about time runners can look sassy......."

422175,0,"The screws that go into the wooden joist is a bit short and I was uneasy using them to hang any thing. So I replaced them with longer screws. The nut that attaches to the swivel will DEFINITELY become loose with use. Everlast should have supplied 2 nuts for that swivel screw. I had to find extra nut to secure the swivel from becoming loose with use.Other than that, I have to put in more hours before making additional impressions.I hang a 80lb heavy bag."
472161,1,Read a a lot of the reviews and decided to get this watch. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I wanted a watch with a sweep second hand and one that I don't have to worry about getting wet. The watch looks a lot nicer in person then in the pictures. I am so pleased I am thinking about getting the 9937 as well...
435934,1,"There is some dispute by other reviews over the thickness of this product. All I know is that this cord is the same thickness as the cord in my tent pole that it is intended yo replace. It is not too thin to do the job and it does the job well. This is not some flimsy cord that has no elasticity. This cord is perfect for this job and will hold up well. I have multiple tents: a Cabelas, a Kelty, and a Coleman. This cord is just as thick and strong as the cord in the poles of any of those tents. I have used this cord to repair one tent pole and now keep a package of it on hand on campouts as backup just in case. The other thing I like is that it is 18 feet long. Other replacement cords sold (think big box store) are only 5 feet long which is practically useless in most tent pole applications. This Coghlans product does the job."
83694,0,"Yes, after reading all the reviews, I can see that except for the traditional tan color, all other colors wanted to purchase or put in my wish list change to polyester/spandex ribb, and not cotton, so the issue is not fixed yet ladies, also, the ribb, which seems to be too hot for summer wear, jumps to $40 in price, compared to the cotton, so I will have to wait to buy other colors, until the description is fixed. Thank you ladies, for your review comments, as I rely on these to make my purchases."
415760,2,"A very, clunky, front heavy with light stock type of gun. Accurate once you sight in and then with the cheap sights, it falls out of accuracy. Mounted a scope, tightened well, and the scope creeped off and began to fall off the rear. I think there are better products out there but you are going to pay for them."
466568,0,"Overall, pretty comfortable to use, and produces a good, identifiable sound. Have used it in a convention center tournament with 65 courts, with good results. However, it has three sound outlet ports spaced evenly around the whistle. One is against my chin, and after repeated use as R1, the saliva that comes out of the whistle starts running down my chin, and is a distraction. No problems when working as R2 since the whistle is blown much less frequently."
180103,0,"This fits my two dogs well - I have a boxer-pitbull and a Great Dane-Australian Shepherd mix. The adjustable straps work well, the saddle bag capacity is generous, and it sits in a good place on the dogs' backs. However - the belly strap doesn't have a way to tuck away the excess strap. And, unfortunately, the loop on the back for the leash broke with one hard tug from my pooch.So, I will use it. And replace the metal ring. And cut off the excess strap. The other features are nice, the padding is super-nice... and I will continue to use it."

403265,1,"The reviews give a mixed picture on what one gets, some mention tennis, some mention what I describe below. Amazon needs to figure out how to properly relay what customers will get.The set I received had NO Competivision lenses that are for tennis, but instead two sets of different shades EagleVision, plus TNS Gun for driving. Additional lenses can be gotten elsewhere including Amazon."
69211,0,"Ordered this product, took a full week to receive. It is a nice roller, but not as dense or hard as I thought it would be due to the reviews and high cost. Would recommend buying one that comes with tips on how to use a roller/ buy a denser roller. Hopefully it will help the hurt knee! Consider buying one of smaller size too if you are tight on space."
462737,2,"6 months after the buying the knife, and barely using it, it is already showing major use. Blade sticks. I have recently bought a HK automatic (American) and am much more pleased with that purchase even though it was 4x as a much. I would send it back if I could. I have sent 2 other Gerber knifes back this year as they were all of low quality. I grew up with Gerber, sad to see."
338477,1,"I am so pleased with this product. I wanted something easy as I am a ""gadgetly challenged"" (I think I made that up??) person. All directions were easy to follow and it is working great. It is extremely inspiring. I am increasing my mobility on a daily basis. It is fun and interesting to find little things to do to increase your steps to meet the goal you have set for the day. Also it makes you pay attention and make your steps count as it considers your weight and stride when recording the number of steps you are taking. I would highly recommend this product. It arrived in a timely manner and with everything intact!"

187549,2,"The Kettler Rear Bicycle Basket has some problems. Primarily, the spot welds wear out over time. After 3 months of daily use (mostly groceries, about 5-10 Lbs), the welds which connect the bottom brackets to the basket itself simply wore out--the brackets are the lower handles shown in the picture provided by Amazon. Now, there is no way to attach the basket to my bicycle rack. I believe the bumps and vibrations of my daily ride slowly weakened these welds to the point that they detached. The basket had other problems as well (over uneven pavement, it would occasionally fly off and tumble into the street), but the poor welding is what ultimately rendered the basket totally unworkable.I would not recommend this basket."
310690,2,"The new 'EcoLiner' liners in these bottles will peel off!!! At first I thought I had a piece of debris, hair or something in my bottle, then I realized it was from the bottle itself. I tugged at it a little and the yellowish liner of the bottle peeled right out of the threads. The chance of ingesting this peeling is very good. Worse for you than a little BPA, I'm guessing... Don't buy a Sigg!!"
429394,0,"I don't have problem with this ball's quality. It's actually pretty strong to hold a heavy person. But the pump comes with it is a piece of junk. It broke right after I used it the first time (luckily it broke after the ball is filled). And the whole ball/package stinks very bad, mostly from the organic solvent when they make plastic/rubber. It stinks so bad that I don't even want my kid to be near this ball. And after one week I can still smell the solvent. I will suggest not to use it right after you open the package, instead, put it outdoors or somewhere that has ventilation and get rid of those solvent as much as possible then you start using it. Otherwise, you know you breath in more air when you are excercising, right? Those solvent are usually carcinogent."
319694,1,"We've been through several volleyballs sets over the years; they all end up trashed in no time, and the net never is as tight as you want it to be. The Mongoose set is the best portable set we've had! And no guy wires! The directions do have a bit to be desired, but once you figure it out, it's awesome. Highly recommended."
98205,0,The tennis ball fell apart the first time it was used. Took 3-4 weeks to get a replacement.
351844,1,"This heart rate monitor is great. Especially for the price. The watch itself is not big and bulky, but the display is easy to read even during a workout. The chest strap is comfortable and you hardly notice you are wearing during a training session. The information that this unit provides is perfect. Constant heart rate, timer, clock, then when you are finished, there is a nice review. Giving you total time, total time in and out of selected heart rate zones, total calories burned and more. Great buy for a great price."
375543,1,"AMAZINGLY fast delivery! GREAT Peace Sign flag, it flies proudly on my pole lit up by solar ball light string top to bottom of pole vertically.

92383,0,"Seen these on TV and it was nice to get it. It was fun to get on it but it would never feel like I did anything with it. It folds up for storage and it is nice if you can not afford an elliplical, however it does not achieve the same results. I recommend that you get this product if you are starting out with work outs, or if you are getting over an injury for physical therapy. I do not recommend this product however if you like to run or move fast, because it does not even make you sweat!"

443087,0,"The boots are indeed black, but the picture makes the leg of the boot look slender and stylish. The boot is actually quite bulky and unflattering. It also has a horrid industrial smell the took over my bedroom. I have to leave the boots on the balcony due to the smell."
51723,2,"Ok - here's the skinny. The gun is junk. I bought two for my 8 year-old twin boys this Christmas 2012. Both failed within 4 hours of opening; the magazines were not properly locking into place, dropping down away from the receiver and causing the guns to jam. After disassembling them to fix, I find the magazines are held in place by a 4mm plastic post (friction fit). Once removed and replaced 40 to 50 times the post snaps off, the magazine drops slightly, and the rubber bullets jam on cocking the gun. After telling the boys they need to flip the gun upside down so the magazine doesn't drop out I see the barrel on one gun is wobbly. On disassembling, I see the plastic screw tang that secures the forestock (part where the palm of your hand rests) to the breech (trigger/lever part) is split. This can't be fixed so I end up gluing the whole thing together with plastic adhesive. Now they work but I'm sure not for long. I see the stocks are also prone to snapping off. Don't buy - just get a Daisy BB gun and when the kid is ready buy BBs for them. Really too bad since - when working - the gun is quite realistic and fires very accurately. Unfortunately the manufacture (Edison Giocattoli) elected to manufacture them with the absolute cheapest materials. They are crap and will disappoint. All of the reviews above are either bogus posts by the seller, or, they've not used the guns for any length of time, or, Edison Giocattoli put out a more robust model prior to Christmas 2012. Edison Giocattoli very well may build a more robust model since I've seen some nice play guns come out of that Italian factory. The design is solid, the materials are crap. My hunch is they re-tooled the gun for the US market knowing they can sell the junk guns easily over in here since there is no other competition in the wussy, politically correct, US market place. In Europe there are a number of excellent toy gun manufactures. Merry Christmas - I'm off to buy a couple of Red Rider Daisy's."

210820,0,"These were the first climbing shoes I bought. They lasted about 6 months (climbing indoors 2-3 times a week) before I wore a whole in both toes. They are decently comfortable for a lower end shoe, but now that I have been climbing with my new 5.10 Anasazi's I can understand why they are so much cheaper. The Anasazi's are a huge step up in accuracy and aggressiveness, without really sacrificing any comfort. If you are new to climbing and aren't sure if you want to shell out $130 for shoes the eVolvs will be a good starting point, but if you want to do some real climbing look for something else. And start with the 5.10 Anasazi (FiveTen Men's Anasazi VCS Onyx Climbing Shoe)"

279270,0,We had this bed for guests and it was left inflated one day. The cat sliced a hole in it. So we bought a replacement because it was pretty comfortable and kept inflating well. We've been using it for the past three weeks while guests are in town and the past two nights it's halfway deflated by morning- our bottoms are touching the ground.Pros: easy to inflate and deflateCons: Loses air after a few weeks of useSummary: Great for the occasional visitor.

168517,0,Same as the ones you've probably seen in cities across the world. I personally thinks it bounces a little too high and is a little big and would recommend a NeverFlat instead if you can afford it. If you just want a cheaper ball to run with you this is still pretty good.
448993,2,"I have spent more money fixing this bike up than I did on buying it in the first place. It is badly made to a dangerous degree and I cannot stress enough how much you'll regret buying it.I just needed a bike for a year while I lived overseas, so thought I'd save money on a super-duper bike and get this one - it looked pretty. Having assembled several bikes bought over the internet before, I decided to overlook the warnings in countless Amazon reviews that it was really difficult to put together. I wish I hadn't.Not only was it difficult to assemble, but the seat shaft was damaged in transit so I had to wait for Pacific Cycle to send me a new one. They sent me a different part instead. So I waited some more. Once the bike was finally safe to ride, a nut came loose on my first ride, revealing that the pedals were dangerously badly made and the whole crank had to be replaced. I'm known in my local bike store as 'cash cow'.I can just about ride this bike now, but the handlebars have a habit of sliding up and down, no matter how tight you fix them, and the chain fell off twice in one day of riding along a flat road. DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE.While the customer service at Pacific Cycle was good on the phone and parts (albeit the wrong ones) dispatched swiftly, I have yet to receive a response to a letter of complaint I sent over 28 days ago. DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE."

198831,0,"I bought this saddle for an old Pacific road bike that I am transforming into the ultimate comfort/hybrid bike! :) I wanted a saddle that is comfy but not too wide. I previously had a Schwinn cruiser seat that was too wide for me and rubbed my chubby little thighs. I am 5'3"" and weigh 190 lbs. As such, I wanted to find a saddle that is not too wide or too narrow and has some cushion AND didn't cost a fortune. I paid $17.00 and change for this saddle. The seat is attractive and for me the perfect width. It has a nice firm 'squishy' feel and surprisingly does absorb the shock pretty well considering it has no springs. However, before long I can feel my seat bones pressing on the seat's rails, which really starts to hurt. My bo'om is ready to stop riding long before the rest of me, which is not beneficial to helping me to burn off the excess pounds, which is the reason I wanted to get a bike. A minor complaint is that the Schwinn emblems on the sides of the saddle began to rub off after the first ride. This seat may work well for someone who is lighter, but if you're heavy, I would recommend that you do some more shopping."

173459,0,"I purchased these Olympus binoculars at the same time a set of Canon 10x30 Image Stabilization Binoculars. I wanted two for a trip in May for my wife and myself. After using the higher priced Canons with image stabilization and large field of view, everything else does not seem that good. With the small eye pieces I find it hard with the Olympus to align my eyes with the eye pieces and therefore see out of both eyes well. Also keep in mind that when you do use the large zoom option, you are loosing a lot of light which is OK during the day. This is of course not a good feature in the evenings or night.I know a lot of these shortfalls all come from being small travel binoculars which is why I gave it a 3 star rating instead of a lower rating. Image quality is good for the size and the zoom is a nice feature, but the image will be hard to keep in the field of view on the largest setting. If you do have the money, then these work well for the size. If you can afford to spend more and give some on weight and size, then I really recommend the Canon Image Stabilization Binoculars."
460695,0,"I use this ball to sit on at my work desk all day long. For that purpose, there are two drawbacks - it deflates enough to need air at least once a week and it doesn't have a 'base' (one area on the ball is heavier or has a pocket of sand) like some do that stops it from rolling away. Maybe unfair to rate 3 stars for this purpsoe, but...there are better options out there."

396656,0,"Tracey, along with cast members, Josef, Barbie and Jill, are in this kickboxing workout. I was expecting good things with this workout but I was sadly disappointed.What I liked about this workout:**Josef. He's a natural teacher. He leads some of the sections and those sections are nice and intense, just what I was looking for.**the interesting set. The workout is filmed in a dark wood set and the lighting is low. I liked this since it fits with gritty feel of the workout.**the music type fits the workout. I like the music genre since it fits in nicely with the workout. However, the workout is off-beat from the music (see below).**Tracey's chemistry with Josef. They complement each other.What really detracted from this workout:**the moves are offbeat from the music. This is Tracey's fourth series and there is no excuse for such production issues.**it's not very intense. I do the workout with 1 pound weighted gloves and my heart rate is only in the low end of my aerobic zone. The only time my heart rate is high is when Josef is leading a section.**annoying chapter titles between each section. It's artsy looking, but completely disrupts the flow of the workout. It's a pain to have to keep shuffling or doing jumping jacks to keep my heart rate up when the titles are showing.**Sloppy editing. In Strike Zone 4, Tracey completely misses doing one side of the routine.**the odd placement of the spider web section. The spider web move is when you're on the ground and switch from crab to table top. This move should be at the end of the workout as a preparation for the cool down, not in the middle of the workout.I suggest this workout to folks wanting a less intense workout with a gritty feel and an interesting set."

They really have an tendency to dig into my skin, particularly when I tighten it down to work out. I'm sticking with it cause it works, but if I had a pile of money or could do it over again I would probably try a neoprene like product with thicker more comfortable bands. Another minor gripe is the black on the logo rubs off really easily. Get it a little wet with sweat and rub against it makes you look like you have been playing with a broken pen."

First off, I could literally pull my boresnake through my M4 once and the barrel would be clean (though I usually pulled it through two to three times anyway). This product's wire brush did not feel big enough to thoroughly clean the barrel (very little resistance). Same for the ""patch"" rope. Also, it took pulling the wire brush through twice and the patch through two to three times to get the results of one pull of my boresnake. I'm glad I tried it out and I certainly won't throw it away or send it back, but its not as good as the Hoppe's single rope boresnake."

Target online was cheaper, however, the shipping cost was ridiculous.The trike is easy to assemble and so far, it's been pretty durable. I think it will last a long time. I should have invested in this trike a long time ago because it's a 3 in 1 trike that an infant can rock on and then later it can be converted into a trike.My two year old loves riding this trike and is learning how to pedal on his own.

All are positive, but it has some negatives: 2 units were defective out of the box. No rubber grip on sides, and is not water resistant. The design could be better."
293818,1,"These thongs rival those of the popular brand. Their soles are soft and conform to your feet, their tread is sturdy, the arch support is comfortable, and they're good-looking. They are built wide, which is good because my feet are wide, and run a fraction small. I was able to get away with my usual size 8, but barely.My only gripe is that the straps are a little loose. These thongs flip-flop more than the popular brand. However, Reef does not line their straps with the kind of nylon stitching that scratches and burns the top of the feet of people sensitive to nylon. I can wear them all day without the discomfort that comes from nylon stitching coming in contact with my bare feet."
103951,1,"I'm very picky buying clothes. I quit buying ""sale"" items rather than just figuring out what fits me the best, looks good, and is comfortable.

I am awaiting the return of the new unit.Also, my wife has the non-downloadable version of this pedometer. It has a reset button on the front that allows you to check mileage on a walk by setting back to zero which this unit doesn't allow. It is slightly smaller and less expensive."
75257,0,"if you are looking for a cheap tent (that is not the lightest, but light enough for the price range) for 1 person, that you only plan to use a few times, this tent will do. I am not a big backpacker, but I've gone a half dozen times with my dad and brother. This tent fit my needs at the time given that my brother had a tent that he and my dad fit in, so I only needed to fit myself and my pack.It claims to fit 2 people, however it would be tight and then your bags would definitely have to be stored outside the tent. Most likely you would have to spoon in order to fit, so I hope neither are big movers in their sleep. The tapered shape may roust claustrophia in those very sensitive to small spaces, but it was fine for me.The weight is a little heavier than ideal (by a few pounds), but paired with a light sleeping bag and very limited clothes and supplies, it will do.The first or second use of it resulted is a broken zipper on the rain fly. Given the season I typically used it, this was fine. I simply draped the rain fly over it, without zipping. The third or fourth use resulted in some sticking and misalignment of the zipper on the tent itself. It is still useable, however it makes me nervous that it is only a matter of time before it breaks completely and I am left susceptible to bugs and small animals.Areas with high levels of condensation may result in moisture being leaked into the tent. One trip along the coast had me waking up to drops of water on my head.Given the price, however, it's hard to complain too much!"

166578,2,"The same thing happened to me using this product as happened to the previous reviewer. For all the quality products Lodge makes, this one is garbage. I learned that the hard way when the handle came unlocked as I emptied hot french fries out of it. The fries came within centimeters of scalding my hand. And I couldn't believe the catch was not wide enough to rest on the side of the very dutch oven for which it was designed! I'm going to get a basket whose handle does not fold into the basket for easy storage. I'll take the loss of a little more storage space over a trip to the burn unit any day. If I can find the receipt this one is going back. Problem is I think I threw it away. Aaarrgghh!"
344665,0,"This is a nice product, just be careful with the sizing. My son wears a size 12 jeans and weighs about 90 pounds, he needs a size medium pants.

244981,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."

Showed up with the yellow lenses attached and the other 4 lenses are inside of the case. The case is awesome. Fits the glasses with no problem and has 4 individual slots for the spare lenses. Only issue is (which was not a surprise to me) The blue lens in the picture is actually black (smoke). I read that in the description thinking maybe it was a typo but it is actually yellow, red, clear, and black (smoke)."

403829,1,"I have a 2006 Maxum 1800mx (135hp Mercruiser), which runs a 21p 3 blade at sea level (4800 rpm) with 5 on board. I bought this prop for use at Big Bear Lake (6800 ft). This was the perfect match! 7 persons on board and was able to pull a wakeboard and tube at 4500 rpm. The Turning Point calculator was right on. Great quality at a great price. This is my second TP prop and will buy more in the future."
235219,1,"I'm an army guy and this is pretty cool.. I love the nice, large compass face and the bright tick-marks everywhere. Maybe it should be glass, but i'm sure people would be stupid, drop it, and cut themselves. I read elsewhere that the tick-marks will wear off, so it may be best to coat all of them with the highest quality clear nail polish you can find. My wife had some ""diamond"" coat stuff and said it was really good, so that's what I used. Worked flawlessly in land navigation, the Sedona wilderness. No issues whatsoever and kicks the snot out of any GPS."
93072,1,"I gave this 4-stars because it's pretty good, but not perfect. I've had this unit for over 3 years now and there are times when the data goes beserk. I figure it's from sweat getting into the snaps which can corrode. I noticed that after cleaning the snaps, the reliability improves. I wanted to blame the battery but after cleaning the snaps (removing the green colored corrosion) all was well. Now, I put a dab of vasaline in the snaps to help keep it clean. I wash the sweat off the snaps after each workout. The only other problem I've noticed is that when carrying the unit in a travel bag, the buttons can get pushed to activate the monitor and store bogus data. Even after using the ""LOCK"" feature, it can become unlocked and start recording. The fix for that is to just wear the unit while traveling. No biggie, but it does happen.As for the ""KEEP-U-FIT"", I stopped using it as I felt like I wasn't getting a good workout for my condition. I workout about 5 days a week for an hour each and I believe Polar programs these things on the conservative side so that you don't over do it. Keeps lawsuits to a minimum, I guess.I now use the manual mode where I set my own limits as it gives me the final say in my workouts. I prefer to use more advanced HR calculations instead of the ""220 - your age"", as it is not for everyone. All this time I've owned it, I've only had to reset it two times after it ""locked-up"" for some strange reason.I like the built-in diary as I can go back later and retrieve the information for my excel spreadsheet.Would I buy this unit again? Probably. It has all the features I need to keep track of calories, HRmax, HRavg, HR%, alarms, and workout time. My only beef is the chest strap and snaps that can corrode, causing the sender to malfunction. Regular maintenance will extend the life of the chest strap."
178021,0,"PRO's: It's a good size blade that's not too heavy, fits well in your pocket, and is rather light for its size. I love the spring assist, it ensures that every time you open the knife, it opens fully and locks. You don't need to flick your wrist while opening it like you do with some knives. The clip allows it to carry deep in your pocket so it's not so likely to fall out.CON's: the factory edge didn't hold. after a few weeks it's now hard to cut a rag. The clip works great on jeans where there's a firm lip on the back pocket, but if I'm wearing pants with a flimsey back pocket (like some dickies, or cargo pants), it takes a few tries and sometimes 2 hands to get it on the pocket. The groove that allows you to access the blade while it's folded closed is the reason I chose this model - unfortunately it's useless. It won't cut anything. It's poorly designed so that the material being cut is pulling against the handle and not the exposed blade. It wouldn't even cut card board. Also, some times when you're putting the knife in your pocket, the pocket rim gets stuck in this groove (good thing it won't cut anything).CONCLUSION: I like SOG products, and I still carry this knife at work, but if I could do it again I'd go with another model."
348102,0,I like these as they seem to run a bit small and my foot is about a 7 or 7.5 length. Minimal cushioning and best for warm weather.
119671,2,"Before ordering, we looked up the measurements on the Stearns website, so we could be sure to order the correct size. This arrived and is being returned on Monday at first UPS pickup. The size is NOT correct. XL is stated to fit up to a 48"" chest on Stearns website (Amazon, inconveniently, does NOT provide ANY sizing info), but this does NOT fit that way. FAR too small. It looked like my husband was trying to wear a child's life vest when he tried this on - it rode up way too high around him on all sides, and while it did close in front, it just looked too small. He also said it just didn't feel right - the ""riding up"" all around meant that the shoulders didn't rest properly on his shoulders. This is NOT the insecure feeling you want when you're swimming in Lake Michigan, esp. if there are one to three foot waves! We are not water testing this - we got it last night, and it's already packed up to be picked up for return on Monday.Amazon, please start providing sizing info (that you verify yourselves...don't just go by manufacturer's stated measurements) so that your customers can buy with more confidence!I am still giving this two stars, though, because the quality SEEMS to be good (nice padding, good shoulder webbing, etc.) If only the sizing info were provided accurately (or at ALL...Amazon, I'm talking to YOU here).I recommend buying this in store, in person, AFTER trying on. Do NOT buy this via mail or online order...you'll likely be disappointed.OTOH, the Body Glove life jacket that we ordered DOES fit correctly, just as per the stated measurements. We're keeping that one. So it's down to the usual: some things are better bought in person, after personally trying on, than others. This life jacket is one of those items."

99870,0,"I didn't do as much research before buying this table, but after the assemble, ( really isn't that hard, but it does need 2 people when you put on the boards) could not understand why there is no bounce to the table. Bought 3 star balls, tried on different type of floor, then realized maybe it's the table. Long and behold, after some deep research, found that butterfly's outdoor synthetic surface's bounce is extra low.The table itself is great quality, if you are just learning or starting new, you will have no problem. But for someone who's played for a while and use to a wood surface or regular bounce, this bounce will not work at all. Ping Pong is more skill and agile than brute force, but the low bounce on this surface forces you to either hit the ball very high, or use brute force on each hit. Ended up forced to return to Amazon."
315826,0,"These were very cheap pants, and as the saying goes; you get what you pay for. Everything seems to stick to these pants because of the cheap material. They are sufficient for just a workout, but far from something you would want to wear in a demo or any display!"

That's when he told us it can't be used in the game because, and I quote, ""It's egg shaped"". I didn't notice it before probably because I didn't bother to inspect it myself. Sure enough, it's lopsided. What gets me is that a company that makes balls for a living can't figure out how to make a round ball round. Save your money on this one. It's worthless junk for soccer purposes."
93055,0,Pros:Excercise program is nice. Has workout history.Cons:Displays Heart Rate or % of Max.

Polar support said to replace the battery in the transmitter. Didn't help. Original battery tested fine (supposed to last 2500 hours). Had to send it in for warranty repair. Took 2 weeks and I had to pay shipping both ways. No cross ship available.
222065,1,My husband loves this bike-it is the talk of the town (small town). This bike allows him to get around (He has PAD). He liked it so well he bought one for me also. We have two and love them.

196532,1,I am very happy with my new life vest. It is comfortable and well made and it fits me perfect. Nice zipper and buckles in the front. And the two zipper pockets in the front open and close easily and are roomy. Very nice life vest for the price.
414078,2,"This is the first review I have ever made, despite ordering an average of at least $500 of products a month. Generally, I'm happy with the products I order. This is the exception. I wanted a durable, easy to clean water bottle. Technically, this design satisfies both of these criteria. However, when I filled it up with water and turned it over, it leaked like a sieve. There is a gasket at the top, but it was ineffective. I rarely return products, but I did return this one."

It does clean good, but leaves me worried if pulling too hard will break the pulling string. Other than that no complains."

33265,1,"If you want absolute protection buy a Browning Travel Vault or the Pelican vaults This is better than the cheapest cases and has a plastic pillar which does provide added protection from side damages.

I would NOT USE this to transport on an airline. I use the cases when shipping a rifle that has been sold as the best means of ensuring the rifle has a chance of getting there intact, at reasonable cost. &lt;Note: UPS did manage to ram a rifle through a case similar to this, going completely through the end of the case, damaging the front sight on a Ruger rifle.

20106,0,"I received this watch as a Christmas gift over a year ago. I'm still very impressed with the compass and barometer features. Being an amateur astronomer, I'm one of those few that actually use the moon phase feature. But it's not accurate - always a couple days off. The rotating compass ring above the crystal is starting to rotate too easily so I'm worried that it may someday fall off. Also the watch is not super accurate.

217302,0,"I bought this product to knock around in my home gym. I used sand to fill the base which took FOREVER. If I wanted to use water, a standard water hose would have taken a lot less time but I didn't want the water to be constantly washing around. The opening to the base could be a lot wider... making it easier for those who want to use sand instead of water. The bag slides up and down on the center piece and when you lock it into place in each of the three different height adjustments it still seems to wobble around a bit. Im a 24 year old female, 5'5"" tall and athletic. I can hit the bag at 60 percent and it moves around a little bit. Overall, the product seems pretty cheaply made."
364262,2,The belt is not the one pictured at least not the buckle. The buckle is smaller and cheaper. The belt itself is flimsy. Once you put equipment on it the belt flops all directions if held and not on your waist. So far it hasn't broken which is the only other thing I can say about it. I bought this just for the buckle to replace that style buckle on a different belt. The buckles are not interchangeable.
297967,2,The plastic belt clip is of no value. Easily pulled up and off belt. Look at Bianchi. They're metal clips will retain the belt lock.

Protective packaging for these and other parts was loose in the carton -- removed or fallen off. At least one part is missing, so I haven't been able to complete assembly. With Amazon's return policy being a bit scary, I'll keep the bike and work out the problems, but wish I'd paid a litte more at the local Target store."

52828,1,Good holster got 2 one for my pm9 and one for my fathers Kimberly solo. Both fit great! I would recommend it. No complaints.
186239,2,"While they don't mention it anywhere, this product will not work for every bike. I tried this on my bike, and it was WAY too big. After tightening it all the way, it was still extremely loose (wobbling up and down and swinging side to side). Fortunately, I bought it at a local store, so I can return it without too much hassle. If you do buy this, I would not get it online! Who wants to pay return shipping?I also noticed that even if it had fit, a lot the platform was hidden under the bike seat. While this would be OK for very small, short loads, if you are looking to put something a bit bigger/taller on this, I don't think this is your product."

232027,1,"My very persnickety teenage daughter loves these. I am going to have to buy another pair for her. She wears them around the house as comfy lounge pants, under her jeans like long-underwear (she gets cold easy!), and in a few weeks when a dance style PE class starts up, she'll be wearing them for that. She's not inclined to wear as such, but they would work well with a long sweater or tunic top. A nice mid-weight material."

I'm comparing it to professional shops that do waxing and a sample I received with my home wax kit. It didn't live up to it's name ""Super Hot Sauce"" The product was good enough that I brought their racing wax with the expectation that it will be superior. Not sure if I need racing wax, but I'll give it a try."

335656,0,"The bowflex is a great piece of equipment for fitness or strength training, I have a friend that owns one and have experienced it. However, to own one you will have to pay over six hundred dollars to experience its greatness. At my local gym it costs about thirty bucks for a monthly membership: all the free weights and machine weights you need to get in shape. It is a PROVEN fact that free weights are more efficient and more vigorous than fixed machine weights, such as the bowflex. In many bowflex commercials and other fitness product commercials alike, there is always the common question: ""Why spend more money going to a gym when you can use our product?"" Well, I could spend three months in the gym with free weights and get in great shape for ninety dollars, while the bowflex costs six hundred and there's no telling how long it will take to build up your strength, considering the fact that free weights are better than fixed weights, such as the bowflex. So which option is really getting you in better shape while saving you more money?If spending an arm and a leg isn't a hassle for you, then by all means get the bowflex. But if you want to get in shape in less time for less money, then get in a gym."

10729,0,I was a little disappointed in this because I had a fleece vest from American Eagle that was thicker and was made from better material. This one looks more like the inside of sweatshirt than real quality fleece.
52446,0,The shirts are great. Fortunately the material is heavy enough for alterations. One of the shirts head hole is so small couldn't get past ears so had to cut and hem. Is Amazon selling factory seconds? With postage and repacking not worth returning.
215476,0,"When these breeches arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the fit was pretty good. I'm only 4'11"" and the 28's weren't too long and didn't bag too much in the knees (common when you're shorter with breeches!). However, after riding in them a bit, I wish they had a bit more give in the fabric to conform to my body. Once on my horse, I had to really pull on them to adjust the legs upward for a comfortable ride. I just didn't get enough give in the crotch to make them comfy enough, though I think they fit well when standing! Perhaps I just need to break these in more, but I'll have to wait for the cool weather as the synthetic full seat is also a bit sweat inducing. Granted I rode in an indoor arena, when it was probably over 85, but I don't have as much of a pooling sweat issue in my seat when I wear a cotton breech. I think with a bit more riding time in these and cooler weather, they'll be good though. They seem extremely well made so could stand up to some washing for a more worn feel. Then, these will probably be among my favorites for cool weather riding!"

34326,2,"This product was received on time and in very good condition but ""fit"" people beware! First I should say that I'm 6'1"" and 170 lbs. No beer belly here... and that seems to be part of the problem with the way this product fits. (Or more accurately doesn't fit) I'm pretty sure I could curl up into a ball and fit my entire body into the torso of this ""sweater"" without stretching it out. Perhaps this was designed to fit a more ""husky"" body type. If you are short and stocky you have a better chance of being satisfied with this product."
394575,0,"This mount works well. Installed easily. It should have a set screw though. With the back angle it needs to be able to lock in the pole. Otherwise, a good pole mount."
378496,1,"Plus: volume. Minus: designed for straight handle bars not drop bars. A must have for any cyclist who has to fend off clueless car drivers. Car drivers don't seem to realize that cyclists are traveling anywhere from 10 - 30 mph and therefore always seem to think they can make a turn in front of you. Well, not anymore if you got this horn. If one of these unconscious drivers looks like they might cut you off just give them a little toot and they'll be frozen in their tracks. As far as the other comments about pedestrians; pedestrians always have the right of way (on the streets and the trails) so do a little positive PR for cycling as a sport and stop for them, smile, say hi and then proceed."
126291,2,"A feature rich product offering Mac OSX compatiblity, distance and HRM data combined into graphs. Overall I found the product let down by quality control issues. The first watch I got had to be returned due to the USB pod simply not working at all. Kudos to Amazon for replacing it promtly. The second watch worked for a while - about 200km - then started to give intermittant HRM readings. Overall I found the HRM strap needed to be tighter than my Polar and that the reading did require that I wet the pads everytime before starting my run.The other thing that the Polar range has over Nike is that when you run at night it's easy to just bring the Polar up to your chest and the light comes on - not with Nikes best - It requires you know which of the 5 buttons to press, to get the light on - easy if you do it right, but you can accidently stop the run recording if you press the wrong button in the dark while running.Buy lots of CR2032 batteries because you need to change them often. I have already changed the watch and the HRM battery in the first 175km, and the watch was set to power saving mode.Although it works OK with OSX 10.4.9 the Nike software has not been updated since 2004 - that's 3 years - of no new driver or feature support - pretty good indication that Nike has moved it's attention elsewhere. The monitor area is poorly used with a small 9"" window opens up on your 20"" Mac which cannot be enlarged - then you get small little graphs you can hardly see. My advise is, if you buy a few spare parts like a HRM, footpod and USB unit then it should give you good data - otherwise expect to take it back under warranty - while you can."
21113,0,"This box (Plano 3600 Size Prolatch) has between 6 and 21 compartments (36 if you make your own dividers or take from another box).This is a flat bottomed box with six vertical compartments built in. It comes with 15 movable subdividers, so without ransacking another box you can have 21 compartments. (6+15=21). Each compartment can, in theory, be subdivided into 6 equal sections (with an exception for four at the front). Four of the compartments at the front are a little smaller as they are irregular to accommodate the latch. If you had enough dividers, say hijacked from other boxes, you could have 36 sections.Lid and base are molded separately with a snap together hinge. The catches snap crisply, closing the box easily and securely. (I have three Plano boxes that I have been using for a while now with these latches and I love the latches.) Dividers and sub-dividers meet the lid flush so the box can be turned upside down, sideways, shaken and still keep the compartments sorted.The 1-11/16"" width of the 6 compartments holds floss cards fine but where the division supports are is not wide enough for them. Some other Plano boxes have curved bottoms in the compartments that make retrieving tiny things like beads (or Lego people's tools) easier. This box does not have that so tiny items like beads are hard to slide out.All that said... I might in a pinch use this for my floss box but I have two already that are better for that. I would not use it for my beads. It works very well at sorting the little people in my sons' Lego collection. I am not disappointed in this box but I will probably be picking up more of the Creative Options/Plano 2-3630-80 Deep Utility Box and Creative Options Utility Organizer 2-3650-80. If you need a box with a lot of subdivisions this may be the box for you."
105913,1,"This watch - Accutron Val d'Isere Chronograph -- is the watch I take when I go on travel, especially for overseas. I have the now-discontinued all-stainless steel version (the discontinued model also has unidirectional rotating bezel, but about $350 less than one with diamonds on the bezel). It is a handsome watch that can be worn during office meetings or for evening affairs. The watch has the accurate Accutron quartz movement and an eye-catching chronograph feature. It is water-resistance rated for 100 meters/330 feet (swimming pools or snorkeling pose no problem. And though the boat I was on in Thailand's Floating Market did not flip over, this Accutron would have handled the dunk, too). Lastly, adjusting for different time-zones is easier with a feature to only move the hour-hand (while the minute-hand remains fixed 'in place'). I've had my Accutron for over 4 years now, changed the batteries on year-3, not a scratch on the crystal nor the watch case. The bracelet, though, does show a few scuff marks and a couple of nicks."

123771,1,"Nice water proof carrier with room for most things you would carry on a bike. It mounts easily to almost any bike rack. But watch out for the the lid when it raises: In order to open it, and not hit the bike seat, it must be located 4-5 inches back of the bike seat. That wastes about a third of the length of your bike rack and forces you to mount the carrier so far back it overhangs the bike rack by about the same amount. Ideally it would mount flash to the bike seat, but with the current hinge design it's impossible. I recommend a redesign by the manufacturer to hinge on the side (two side by side hinges in the center of the side with opposing snap locks near the corners). Then you could open it and still have it mount flash to the back of the bike seat."
119897,0,"This Brewers lamp is hard to rate. I LOVE how it LOOKS, but the quality is just ok. It's a bit smaller than I pictured it would be. The lamp shade is connected to the base VERY poorly and after a few months the lamp shade already fell off, there is not a way to fix it, I'll have to take it in some where. So, because of the shade and having to deal with finding a place to fix it, I would have to say that I wouldn't have bought it (even though I still think it's the nicest looking one out there)."
126984,2,"I would never buy any product that advertises its self as ultralight and then does not list its weight. I have searched at least 20 sites trying to find the weight of the rod, the reel, and the case. If your going to advertise a product as ultralight it seems very poor judgement to have no information of the actual weight anywhere. Obviously shipping weight is not a useful number. As an avid ultralight camper, fisher, hiker, and rafter, I would not trust any company who does not list the weight of gear advertised as ultralight."

245275,0,"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them). I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas. I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense. The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well. He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him. These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him. He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now. All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts."

169489,0,"This review is for two similar Coleman Xtreme coolers, which are virtually the same size on the exterior: the 70-quart, 5-day, BLUE cooler and the 56-quart, 6-day, GREEN cooler. By the way, these coolers do not come equipped with a plastic shelf to keep food suspended above the melt water.First, let me say that Coleman made its reputation years ago with its workhorse, white-gas cook stoves and lanterns. Today Coleman mostly makes products for backyard use and casual family camping. Coleman generally does not make quality products for avid outdoors people operating in rugged or demanding conditions, so you can't expect too much when purchasing a Coleman product.That said, I went through Amazon.com to purchase a Green Coleman 6-day cooler because I didn't want to shell out hundreds of dollars more for a tougher product and because I needed a cooler that would fit comfortably between the gunwales of our canoes. So far, I have used this cooler on two river trips, the first of which lasted seven days in southern Utah during September, 09. The weather was hot, but could have been hotter. Our block ice lasted 6 days, and on the 7th day we had plenty of ice water, so the cooler achieved its 6-day rating.This was followed with a 4-day trip in October, which wasn't long enough to test the cooling performance of the cooler, but did reveal the cooler's low-quality construction. On the second day out, one of the handles came off when its plastic retaining pin fell out. A member of our party had with them a smaller Coleman Xtreme cooler, and both of its hinges were broken off and useless. So, if you plan to use this cooler much, I would suggest taking the preventive measures described below. And then try to be gentle with it.A few weeks ago I purchased a 70-quart, 5-day Blue cooler at Wal-Mart for $30. At this price I couldn't pass it up. Apparently the store had a few of these left over from last year, and they were being sold at a deep discount because Wal-Mart is featuring a different Coleman Xtreme product line this year. I haven't used this cooler yet, but I can describe how the two Xtreme coolers compare physically.NOTE: See my ""customer images"" available under the main product photo to see what I am describing here.On the exterior, the two coolers are indistinguishable except for the colors. Same cheap plastic hardware on both. On the interior, the 6-day green cooler has noticeably thicker walls implying more insulation, and thus 20 percent less volume than the blue 5-day cooler.Here are the fixes I have adopted in an effort to overcome the flimsy hardware issues. When I got home from the second river trip, I used a screwdriver to pry out the plastic retaining pins on the two handles (two pins each) and glued them back into place with Gorilla glue. This I expect will hold the pins in place for a while. On the newer cooler, I removed the plastic handles altogether and replaced them with rope handles. This type of handle has the advantage of remaining in a fixed position (unlike the original sliding plastic handles) allowing me to run a strap between them to secure the lid in case of a canoe upset.On the interior of each cooler, I have screwed into place a short nylon strap between the lid and the side wall. The strap is long enough to allow the lid to open beyond 90 degrees and remain in an upright and open position, but the strap is short enough to prevent the lid from extending backward far enough to place excessive strain on the hinges. I am hoping this will keep the hinges from snapping anytime soon."

88240,1,Nice knife to keep on your keychain. I don't like that you have to push the lock button to open it as well as close it. I guess it is a necessary evil for something that opens easily and your going to keep in your pocket. The pearl handle has to much pink hue to it as well.
391330,1,"This heart rate monitor tells the time and date, is a stopwatch, a one-minute recovery function, counts your calories burned during a workout and has alarms to keep you in the Heart Rate Zone you want to be in (fat burning / cardio / etc). The strap fits comfortably and transmits a signal constantly to the watch unit. I have worn it 3 days in a row with no problems. If something happens to the strap or it stops working, I'll be sure to edit my review, but for now - the price is right and the product is solid.It does not have GPS.It is important to read the instructions to understand all of the functions of the watch.CONS:Does not work while swimming - it kept trying to tell me that my HR was 38 after 4 laps at the pool. Hmmmmm..."

This once is particular suited for me for it top in the silhouette category, no distractions, easy to see, a GREAT value for the money and I really like the marked areas for most critical hit to least. In short, add these to your collection!"

215607,2,"Bought this NeoSport suit as a birthday gift for my partner.I thought I'd sized it correctly (size 8). The overall length (neck to ankles) was good, hips fit... however torso length was horrifically short giving her a painful neoprene wedgie, it also did not fit at all snug at her shoulders and waist which would have meant it waould be less efficient at keeping her warm. As we were headed for a boogie board outing to celebrate her birthday, we ended up buying anO'Neill Women's Epic II 3/2 CT (Black)Size 6 at a local retailer( She loves her new O'Neill and whenever I see her in it I think she could be their next wetsuit model) .

300692,1,"I bought this elliptical from a local department store in January of 2009. To date, I have lost 15 pounds using this 3-6 times a week. In terms of durability, this thing is amazing for the price. I used to have a gym membership and was skeptical about whether this would measure up to the Precors I loved. Not only is it just as sturdy (I'm a female, about 5'5, 150 lbs,) it takes up significantly less floor space. I keep mine in the sun room in my apartment (the size of a normal balcony/porch in most apartments) and I still have space left over for my ironing board. The ride is very, very smooth and the screen is user-friendly. The arms are positioned in such a way that, for me, I find it easy to use the skiing arms, swing my arms by my side, or hold onto the stationary bars depending on my mood without any interference. The cup/bottle holder is another plus.While the cons of this machine are few and far between, they may be of concern to others, so I'll mention them. From what I can see, the heart rate sensors are not that accurate. I use a Polar heart rate monitor while working out and the two never display similar heart rate readings. Additionally, if you love the crossramp action on Precors, you should be aware before buying that this machine does not have that feature, although I believe there are higher end Schwinn models that do.The only major flaw in this product is the noise. This is the reason for my 4-instead-of-5 star review. I bought my elliptical already put together, as it was a floor model. Therefore, I cannot comment on whether it was tightened too much, etc. It will make random, clicking, squeaking and rubbing noises at any given point. This is a non-issue for me as I wear an Ipod while exercising, and none of the noises are louder enough to be heard over my earphones. I just figured I should let others know that this may be an annoyance if you plan on working out while watching TV, talking on the phone, etc.Overall, however, I feel like this is an extraordinary value for the money and I highly recommend it."

241485,0,"I own several Russell t-shirts that are about 10 years old. They are heavy cotton and even 10 years later...still are holding up well. I got this one today and the cotton is probably 50% of what it used to be. You can almost see through it compared to the old Russell shirts. I think that a Beefy T-shirt is thicker. Disappointing for what they used to be. If you don't mind a thinner cotton shirt, this one is good."

373353,2,"I gave this to her, but I already knew that this wouldnt be great, it would just be another tool she could use.First off, check your local laws, in california these are illegal to carry publicly. But dont quote me on that, I am not a attorney, but Im 99% sure.Now, the brush itself is a standard to lower quality brush.The bristles look sharp, but they arent. They are firm but give a little. To expose the point (which isnt very sharp, you would need to thrust hard, this acts more like a sharper kubotan), the retention of the brush onto the handle is very good, if i shaked the brush hard, the brush would not come off.Id say avoid buying this and just buy cold steel's inferno pepper spray. Dont believe their spray works, check youtube and type in cold steel inferno. I think the results speak for themselves.Overall,If you have money to spend, go ahead, but I would not recommend this. The weapon sells bc of its way to seem harmless until you remove the brush, but honestly, if you werent that experience or cant thrust hard enough (forgive me for being a little discriminant, but i dont think theyre women that can penetrate with this, although i bet there is some gal out there who can, i just say average probably not. Better to just buy a kubotan or a pocket knife or pepper spray."
185763,2,"I spent 30 minutes in the parking lot trying to figure out how to get this rack just right; It never happened...The directions tell you to push in the red buttons and adjust the rack. The problem is that there is no locking mechanism to keep the rack upright. I wound up scratching up my trunk while the bikes dangled there. The design doesn't make sense. By the way I work as a mechanical engineer, and this one puzzled me as to what I was doing wrong. I would buy a different one with a more secure design."
309885,0,"I've used this in the field for two shoots. The design is functional and excellent. The quality of manufacture is less so. The material in the pockets is rather light for holding heavier items like camcorder batteries. Worse, the quality of sewing in the seams is poor, with light thread and stitching and loose ends throughout, already starting to unravel after just six days in the field. I still like it and hope it lasts longer than I expect it to."

490316,0,"There are a ton or great things to say about the SOG FLASH 2. It is well made, fit and finish is excellent, lock up is tight, deployment is extremely fast, zero blade play, light weight, great quality for the price, and best of all it looks great. However, there are a few downsides which I'm sure most people can over look. The biggest downside to me is the fact that the blade does not hold an edge well. When I first purchased the blade it was razor sharp out of the box, and only after a few days of moderate use the blade went dull, extremely quick I might add. I took the knife to be professionally sharpened soon after and it was once again razor sharp; however, after a few days the blade lost its edge and it now has a chip on the center of the blade. I would recommend this knife too anyone that uses a folding knife rarely or doesn't mind having to re-sharpenoften."

164799,0,"I purchased this 5'5"" ugly stick lite to use for trout fishing. I had read several reviews and I thought that it would be a good match for my Pflueger President. When I got the rod I expected the two pieces to be about the same length instead one was about 3 feet long while the other was about 2 feet long. The rod was also very front heavy. I have two of these rods in heavier versions and I like them and use them a lot having caught bass, drum, catfish, hybrids, carp, and musky on them. When I shook the rod to see how it felt I noticed a slight sound, this turned out to be one of the eyelets which was already loose. This rod does however have a five year warranty, and I liked the sensitivity of it better than other ugly sticks. The rod seemed very durable like other ugly sticks other than the guides."

Other people seem to be getting good results with these bars and I don't doubt their claims to be true, but these were definitely not for me."
110182,0,"This bike is phenomenal, i enjoy riding it AFTER i assembled, i do not reccomend this bike to people who are begginers to the world of Mountain Bikes. I found NO assembly instructions for this bike inside like many others. Luckily i have assembled bikes before. When i opened the bikes packagind it wasnt the best box,I believe it was handled poorly. When assembling the bike i noticed the Disc Brakes took ALOT of tweaking. My rear disc break was not properly fit for the bike, OR shipping bumped it and damaged the rear disc,causing it to bend and mechanical failure. I found myself NOT using the Rear Brakes anymore,it was rubbing on the caliper constatly making a noise and slowing me down. I decided to just take off the top and tie back the wire. I reccomend looking into a more exspensive shipping unless you want bent parts. Its a nice bike, but small things like that make the company look poor in the eyes. So i reccomend looking into an inch smaller Rear Disc Brake. A good bike that needs a little more than assembly. Hope my review helps Customers!!"

292283,2,"I am extremely disappointed in the poly-sport bottle top, it has a sports pull-up, push-down kind of thing. If I screw the bottle cap tight it makes an annoying squeaky sound when I drink. If I loosen the twist a little bit I can drink quietly but then it leaks in transit.I have bought several bpa free bottles now and am usually disappointed in the caps. I finally found a $6.99 stainless steal, bpa free bottle at a local store (CVS) with a GREAT cap! Small enough drinking hole so you can drink on the go, wide screw on attachment to clean the bottle and all you do is plug the hole when you need it closed. I am always skeptical of the plastic tops even though they all say bpa free but the kleen canteen unusable plastic top means not using it AT ALL.I bet the land fills will be full of Kleen Canteens when people find bpa free solutions with better caps.If the plastic bottled water industry and local stores can find bpa free, stainless steel bottles with working caps, then I know it's possible."

If this pair of capris were priced at $15 I will be the first to give it five starts and order a whole bunch of pairs. But really, for $32 I can go to Modell's, Sports Authority or another athletic store and get a similar pair for at least half the price. I would not recommend these because there's nothing special about them that make them worth the price."

55441,2,My three year old son has had this bike a little over a month now. He's probably ridden it about ten times. The handlebars have completely ripped off from the bike.

357173,0,"If you are looking for a cheap red dot sight for your BB gun that will never be in any weather other than perfect. This is for you. I purchased it for one of my paintball markers and the first draw back I noticed was that if you adjusted the elevation knob to max, the wires going to the red dot laser are exposed and under tension. Secondly, the mount is made of very cheap plastic, as is the rest of the object. It probably would not stand up to rain (or a paintball hit) and it is not very durable (due to the cheap plastic). The battery is also mounting in a bad place, in order to replace it, you have to remove it from whatever you mounted it to. Lastly, the adjustment knobs don't always stay in place (your zero changes). As advertised, it is definitely for a BB gun and nothing else.On the positive side, the red dot is very bright and lasts at least 2-3 days continuously. The lens that the red dot is projected on is a little hazy, but is clear enough (both eyes should be open anyways...). The adjustment knobs adjust the entire set, not just the red dot, but it is easily zero able And it is very inexpensive. Had the mounting base not broken when I set down my paintball marker, I would have given it a better rating and kept it.Ultimately, you get what you pay for."

82197,0,"1. the ""Oxford"" shorts are shown as a dark maroon kind of colour, which is what I wanted, but NO! I received them in a heather grey colour, even though the packaging still says ""Oxford"". So BEWARE! I don't know if it is a photo error or a packaging error; either way, not worth the postage to return it2. they are small but NOT THAT SMALL! I read the reviews extensively before finally buying them. Previously, someone reviewed saying that she's an S-M and a XL would fit perfectly - which is what I bought. But both pairs arrived amazingly big. I think my boyfriend can wear them! I folded the waistband (note: elastic band, not strings) down twice and the shorts are still too long and too baggy and make my butt look 50% bigger. I'm a size 4 or 6 (ie S or M), and if I were to buy again, I would get size M, or at most L. So be careful when you up the sizes!Unfortunately these were not a good buy for me. I gave it 3 stars, however, because I think if you were lucky enough to get the right size and colour, they would be pretty good and they seem very comfortable."

The supplied pump is a cheap plastic accordion thing, you have to hold the connection tube with one hand while you pump with the other. If you have a small air compressor you can toss the pump! The DVD however was embarrassing. It seems to be a third or forth generation copy from an worn out VHS tape that was left in a puddle for a week. So that speaks of the quality, the content seems to be someone's taping of short fitness blasts on cable tv done in front of Caesar's Palace in Vegas. It pops and sputters along with an an over dubbed silly techno beat picked out by someone who thinks because the beats per minute is high it must fit well with the topic. Horrible! Absolutely embarrassing. If I was as cool as the producers of this DVD I'd hang it from my car rear view mirror to look stylin' instead of watch it ever again.

21392,1,SERPA holsters have always been held in high ranks in my opinion and they work great for most people.

392595,1,"Despite tightening the thumb wheel after attaching my small camera to the mounting screw, the camera will still swivel around the screw. The suction cup works well and overall quality is very good, but I am concerned with the longevity of the rivet on the suction cup puller lever."
51772,0,"I purchased this home gym because I can't always find time to go to the gym. The Caribou will let me do all the exercises I normally do while I'm there with out the travel time to and from and playing the waiting game for a machine. I'll start off by saying that the CPKG-CCO, with weight stack and 300 lb Olympic weight set, is a solid piece of equipment. Comes with and will handle more than enough weight to push me and my family to our limits. It takes some time to put together, but goes up easily with two people. The directions are clear and simple to follow. Just listen when the directions say not to tighten the bolts until instructed to do so and you'll be good to go. The problems come in to play when you look at the manufacturing. For the price, I would expect better attention to detail. First, the Smith and weight stack rods are not smooth. They need to be polished and lubricated with a dry lube. Other wise the action is jerky or worse yet, the weights stick in the middle of a lift. Next is the pec-dec. There are a few problems with this area. The cable for the pec-dec is too long and allows too much play in the fly arms. The seat for the pec-dec attaches to the seat bracket about 3/4 of an inch too low. This causes the seat to rub on the mounting bracket when the seat is raised and lowered in and out of use. I've had my gym for two days and the mounting bracket is already starting to tear the seat cushion. The pec-dec seat is in the way almost any time the lower lat is used. This makes the cable cross over useless since it attaches to the lower lat. Yukon fitness told me that they will send me a pin so I can remove the pec-dec seat when it's not in use. The horseshoe mount's right side is lower then the left side. This is the mount that holds the fly arms. The right fly arm on my gym is sitting lower then the left, so I checked the horseshoe mount with a level. The left and back sides are level and it's mounted square, but the right side slopes towards the front of the machine. On to the cable cross over. The only real problem here, besides the pec-dec seat getting in the way, is it came with five 3 1/2"" pulleys when it was supposed to come with two 3 1/2"" and three 4 1/2"" pulleys. This makes for extra slack in the cable cross over's cables. Yukon Fitness told me to go ahead and use it this way. Now the FID Bench. The seat is mounted to a bracket by three bolts, two on the back and one on the front. The bolt on the front is mounted in a bad location. When the seat is lowered to the flt position, the bolt head rest on an adjustment bar and causes the seat to wobble when in use. I had to cut a section out of the adjustment bar so the bolt head would clear and allow the seat to rest in a stable location. The leg lift accommodates standard weights and does not come with an Olympic sleeve even though the rest of the gym uses Olympic weights. Last, the straight bar and the lat pull down bar don't have any adhesive holding the rubber grips tight. The grips tend to work loose or come off while you're trying to work out. In short, If you're willing to put some extra time and money in to this machine to fix all of the little flaws, when you're done you will have a great home gym that should last forever"

If you have situations were you don't want to carry a normal wallet with all of the stuff inside of it, this is the perfect option.

The wallet is large enough to hold a couple of credit cards and/or a driver license (or other identification) and some money (dollar bills). Since the wallet is plastic, when I go hiking/backpacking I don't have to worry about things getting moist or wet. When we go on trips, primarily overseas, were pickpockets may be a concern, I take my Jimi wallet. It is small and slim enough so that I keep it in my front pants pocket, and I don't have to worry."

Shipping was prompt enough, but when I received the item it was not at all as pictured. The shape was different, granted more accurate to an actual cricket bat, but not flat as shown in the photo. It also had its own cheap rubber handle already attached, something that I cannot take off the item. It was also covered in big black and yellow brand stickers which I will have to peal off and then sand over the whole bat just so that it won't be sticky with adhesive residue. I am giving two starts for the shipping and the fact that the item proper is better material than advertised, but be forwarned, you will not be getting anything that resembles the photo that the seller has provided to Amazon."

335249,0,"I'm not 100% thrilled with this. Honestly, the idea behind the workout is sound. She targets smaller muscles to ""pull in"" the muscles around them, but her method is just not something I can do as a mother and wife. I can't follow her diet exactly, as she recommends, simply because it's not feasible for me to have all the different ingredients and I can't cook a meal 4 times a day. I'm happy to get one meal on the stove! That being said, her stretches and shaping moves are pretty cool. I've been starting the morning with her stretches as soon as I get up and I can certainly feel them! The floor work will challenge you as it's not super easy and some of the moves feel a bit un-natural in the way you move. Okay, the DVD...it's nice that she shows you how to do the moves so you can get your form correct, but it's black and white (making her look silver...kinda creepy) and she doesn't talk or smile or anything. The cardio was just not something I could keep up with. By the time I figured out how to move like she was, she was on to something else."
430008,0,"I am now on day 3 of the TA 30-Day Method. The workouts are tough, but effective. What I would like to focus on is the diet portion of the program. I went to Whole Foods and spent $300 on food for just the first 8 days, and I should have know by the looks of my cart that this was too much.While the recipes are really delicious, my first criticism of the diet portion is that many of the recipes do not indicate how many servings they make. For example, I got all of the ingredients to make the Tomato Minestrone Soup, which made 3 portions. No big deal, I can eat one portion and freeze the other two to eat later. However, the Shrimp Salad made two portions, and this cannot be frozen, so I had to make adjustments to the menu to fit in that other portion before the shrimp went bad. (I'm not just going to toss good shrimp). If I had known it would make two portions, I could have just halved the recipe, but the book doesn't say. The same with the Choco Chestnut Pudding, it made two portions.The second criticism is that I'm finding it to be really time intensive to prepare 3 separate meals each day, plus a fancy snack! I am so glad that I only got food for the first 8 days (which I will struggle to eat before it all goes bad, since you can't just buy 1/4 of a zucchini or a pepper). I will do my best to feed the extras to my family, since I did spend $300 for 8 days, for one person (supposedly)!!I plan to stick with this, but I have to make some modifications in order to continue. My first plan is to just use up the food I already have as effectively as possible, without eating more than recommended. This means pushing off the meals and snacks that are less perishable, front loading the foods that will rot soon, freezing what I can for later (saves $$ and time!) and feed my family what I can. Second, when I make my next meal plan and shopping list I intend to combine the dinner meal with the next day's lunch, so I only make one thing and get two meals out of it. I will also try dovetailing the ingredients to reduce waste: using last night's quinoa in this morning's egg wrap. And, while I like the variety, it creates such a huge shopping list. It would simplify things by just having 2-3 breakfast choices per week instead of 7!So, I don't think that all is lost with this plan. The workouts are really challenging and effective, and I will continue them. But, I think that similar results can still be obtained by keeping the small portions and healthy food choices, just not so much variety."

The fabric of the dividers sheds and leaves a black powdery substance on everything. The clasps are flimsy and I'm concerned that if I lock them I won't be able to get the case open again.

378625,0,"As a consummate cyclist of Chicago, Boston and New York, I have experienced the dangers of urban riding for nearly fifteen years. Not being seen or heard leads to many hazardous, and sometimes life threatening, situations. The Airzound horn will announce your presence to any driver of any vehicle, including eighteen wheelers and Brinks armored cars, within a city block. However, at 115 decibels, riders run the risk of being ticketed by the police. But more importantly, unleashing the Airzound horn can inspire road rage. Clearly, this is not for alerting pedestrians or drivers of vehicles in non-emergency situations.The Airzound horn achieves its intended purpose. Be aware, however, you could seriously upset drivers, residents, and police in the vicinity. This potential danger leads to one of my main arguments against the design. Delta chose not to employ consumable gas cartridges, presumably to save the user money. However, I doubt this horn could be frequently implemented without the rider getting arrested or assaulted. Hence, it should be seen and used as an emergency tool powered by a compact CO2 cartridge. At the same time, it would be nice to have the entire mechanism on the handlebars with a trigger within reach of the rider's thumb or index finger. The current arrangement utilizes a water bottle-like air reservoir connected via a hose to a horn mounted on the handlebars. This is less than ideal as the rider must either use an entire water bottle cage or strap it to the frame. Also, the rider must take one hand off of the handlebar grip to squeeze the trigger, which is unsuitable for emergency situations.In summary, the Air Zound horn is an incredibly loud bicycle horn for unique situations. If you can tolerate the size and exposure to animosity from police and civilians alike, use it with care.ProsReally, really loudNo batteries or consumable items such as CO2LightweightConsBulkyTrigger far from grips/shifterPotential ticketing / animosity"

441488,2,"Keen shoes are EXTREMELY comfortable out of the box, no doubt, and their style and overall construction is well-suited to a variety of activities: casual wear, work wear, and light hiking. Your taste may vary, but I don't think they look too terribly goofy, either.However, like almost every other make and model of shoe, they are ""throwaway"" items, not meant to be resoled or otherwise repaired. I'm on my second pair and neither has made it past the one-year mark before they started to look ratty, despite my assiduous application of Dr. Marten's Wonder Balsam. My current pair is now on its last legs, the soles fraying badly and held together with Shoe Goo, soon to be relegated to my growing collection of ""yard work"" only footwear, all of which look bad but will endure years of continued use in their diminished capacity.This pattern of consumption is terribly wasteful and not at all in the best interests of either the environment or the American workforce (Keens are of course made in China.)A remedy is at hand: for only fifty or so dollars more (and up,) one can have some very well-made American shoes from one of several manufacturers that can be resoled and will last several times longer than the imports. It's a win for the American economy and, in the long run, for your wallet as well."

But once up there, think about it--your whole body is now 4 to 6 inches lower in relation to the saddle! My navel was even with the edge of the saddle SKIRT! This product takes advantage of us as consumers not thinking through the fact that when we mount using a convenient rock or mounting block, we are stepping on it with the NON stirrup foot, which allows us to step easily into the stirrup itself and be at the proper height for easy leg swing-over. I thought maybe I could step in it with my non-stirrup foot and use it like a ladder. But wooooop! I swung under the horse!I bought mine at a local tack store. Nothing against Amazon.

335899,2,"My machine arrived to my house, the delivery person was great, helped me push it into the house.Initially, while assembling the treadmill, I noticed the machining of all the hardware was pathetic: bolt threads were poorly matched to slots, some were finished poorly and had smooth hex edges, thus becoming stripped. I didn't make a big fuss about this, as I was able to tighten them with my own tools without fully stripping them (I'm a mechanic). USE YOUR OWN TOOLS if you put this together, because the tools provided are machined poorly as well, and will surely strip the bolts provided.So I put it all together, I turn the machine on, and it keeps erroring out after 5 seconds. I call Bowflex's parent company Nautilus. Here is where it gets interesting.I speak to a customer representative, and explain the error message I'm getting. Instead of offering to send someone out, the rep instructs me to remove the motor cover panel to diagnose the problem. I did this with some trepidation, but continuing, we (I) spent about an hour figuring out the problem. Keep in mind, troubleshooting is being done by myself, and secondarily from a customer service rep reading a schematic, not a service technician.So then, the rep tells me Nautilus will send out the part we are guessing is broken, that I am going to replace it for them, and on top of that, it's going to take 7-10 business days to arrive, as this is Bowflex's ""slow"" season. So now I'm sitting here waiting, with a defective product.When a company sends defective machinery like this to a customer, they better make sure to remedy the problem in person IMMEDIATELY. They have a headquarters 15 miles from where I live, Nautilus that is. But this is a Bowflex, and apparently they couldn't care less.EDITED: Once the part arrived, it was no small task installing. I cannot believe they left this up to me to fix; anyone without an advanced understanding of mechanics would likely break this machine trying to install the part which was broken (no assembly instructions came either).Unbelievable. The machine stopped erroring, but like the person stated above in another review, my heart rate monitor does not work. Also, the displays keep switching from one to the next, until it stops on the heart rate panel (which does not work on my machine). What a disaster."

218816,0,"I purchased this 10x10 tent used at a Columbia Goodwill store in Oak Grove, Oregon for $8.99. It has some weak money-saving points, such as just two poles to hold up quite a bit of fabric and the woven plastic 'tarp' floor (which gives a plastically feeling and sound when walking on it). There is a lot of tension in the fabric pole sleeves, one of which had a two foot tear (which I sewed shut). The fly is a bit small as it only covers the tent partially, but would protect the ceiling from an overhead rain, while still hitting the water-resistant tent walls and door. The fly is connected with, once installed, very taught, bungee cords at the corners. This tends to push down hard on the top of the tent and caused the walls to sag a bit. It is possible to open the bungee loop and adjust the length to relieve the pressure. Two of the corner grommets were blown out of the nylon straps, a result of the excessive stress in the four corners. This results in the poles pushing out and tent collapse, the grommets may need to be replaced at some point. My preference would be for a three pole design six wall tent in this size to better withstand wind and distribute lateral forces. The woven plastic floor add a lot to the weight of the tent is not a good fabric for cleaning. Washing this tent is not easy, however you may not need a tarp under this tent in wet weather unless you want the bottom of your tent to stay clean. The floor will fail to remain waterproof after a few years due to re-folding causing delamination of the 'tarp' surface. A real fabric floor is superior and, in any case, a regular tarp should be used to keep dirt off the bottom of the tent floor. The door has both fabric and netting single zipper panels. The rear window has a double zipper fabric cover (nice for adjusting the amount of ventilation) and a non-opening netting cover. Both fabric door and window covers close completely. The 20x20 inch ceiling vent does not close, but that has not been a problem for me."

As she bends over you can see more than you need to of her cleavage and everything else.Put on some clothes, put on a smile, give instructions, and give some realistic information! Glad I rented it from the library first."

You need to buy shoes 1/2 size greater to compensate for the thickness. They wear out quickly, move around a lot and bunch up under your feet (these all lead to lots of blisters). If you're a casual player and not as aggressive with your feet, these might be the socks for you. But for young tournament players, get a thinner pair like the Under Armor HeatGear III."
126032,1,"I love Giro helmets b/c they are light weight and every bit as safe as any other helmet. I particularly like the nine helmet because it has a tendency to fit most people. It has removable pads so that you can vent your head on hot days, and keep it warm (warmer than a hat) on cold days. It isn't too huge and silly looking, about as low key as helmets get.IT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE. But, it also is compatible with Giro Tune ups - which plug into your ipod, mini disc player, cd player and more!The sizes run big, so try a size smaller on make sure it is snug and fits like a bike helmet."
